0,TheLittleSongbird,"One of the many times when I've disagreed with the critics, Tomb Raider is flawed but entertaining for its worth!",7,5 September 2009,"This is actually a pretty entertaining movie, flawed it is, but mildly enjoyable. It is yet another case when I have disagreed with the critics, who dismiss it as mindless, nonsensical and pointless. Not true, yes the story is convoluted, it does drag at times and the script is weak at times, but it does have great action and some well chosen locations. As Lara Croft, Angelina Jolie does what she can, and she is fine, even in films with her in that are mediocre at best, she is usually one of the redeeming qualities. Noah Taylor and Jon Voight provide good support. All in all, not at all bad, flawed but entertaining for its worth, better than its sequel anyway. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
1,Leofwine_draca,Some good action in a light fluff piece,5,15 November 2016,"A fairly middling big-budget blockbuster, neither bad enough to be unwatchable or good enough to be re-watchable, this movie wastes a starry cast (most of whom are wasted in nothing roles - as per usual) and one spectacular set-piece in favour of a deeply confused script and far too much flashy location work, when perhaps a little bit more realism and intelligence wouldn't have gone amiss. Sadly, intelligence is somewhat lacking in Hollywood these days by the looks of things, so TOMB RAIDER is happy to rehash cold plot ideas from Indiana Jones and intersperse them with silly MTV-style scenes of action all set to a loud, thumping techno soundtrack.For those who've been living on a mountain top for the past decade, Tomb Raider was originally a pretty cool computer game, one of many in the post-Doom crowd. The idea was that you controlled explorer Lara Croft and explored many temples, mountains, secret underground lairs and countryside in search of untold treasures. Now, I've actually only played the original game a couple of years ago (and none of the sequels), but I enjoyed it for what it was. Has TOMB RAIDER the movie transferred the game's feel to the movies? I'd answer no. While it certainly looks impressive, the ""feel"" of the film is just wrong, especially those impossible-to-reproduce action sequences which seem to have been inspired by THE MATRIX - they're just out of place totally with the game's more simplistic style of action.I had been led to believe that this was an action-packed movie, perhaps similar to THE MUMMY or other blockbusters of recent years, but instead I find a plot-laden film with three large action set-pieces in it. The first comes as an SAS-style team grapple into Croft's country mansion to lay waste to her furniture and attempt to retrieve a priceless artefact. Here we get to watch Croft fly round and round on elastic ropes and do all sorts of impossible moves. The second action sequence takes place in an abandoned South American temple where half of a triangle (or some such nonsense) needs to be discovered. This one scene - which probably lasts for fifteen minutes max - I totally enjoyed, and more of later. The final action comes at the film's end, taking place in the icy wastes of the north, as both Croft and the Illuminati discover a giant mechanism in a hidden cavern. Sadly, this ending is a huge letdown, despite the cool planetary system which spins around and kills people. Here, the film becomes briefly embarrassing (as Croft and her nemesis enter a virtual reality-style world) and has a cop-out ending where time is stopped, allowing Croft to change the future and save the life of her ex-boyfriend. Sounds confusing? It is.Taking the lead as Lara Croft is the much-talked about Angelina Jolie. While Jolie looks fitting for the part and has her British accent down to a tee, she plays the whole thing in an over-the-top tongue in cheek manner, and is far too playful. Somehow, her character is hollow - ironically the sprite which plays Croft in the computer game has more personality. Iain Glen is the typical black-suited bad guy and reminded me too much of Andrew Divoff in this movie. Daniel Craig - who I last saw in a BBC drama - is the blonde, boring muscular boyfriend and doesn't really do much except highlight the film's role reversal of stereotypical male-female action roles, as he ends up playing the ""damsel in distress"" part. Jon Voight - Jolie's real life father - appears in flashbacks as Richard Croft, her screen father as well. Also popping up are both Leslie Phillips and Chris Barrie in surprisingly straight (well, as straight as can be for Barrie) turns as a professor and the butler respectively. And in case you're wondering whom the face of the grizzled Illuminati leader belongs to, it's none other than Richard Johnson! Amazingly he still appears to be going strong although he must be incredibly old by now.The one scene I thoroughly enjoyed in the film consists of Jolie and her pals engaging in some action with an ancient mechanism in a ruined temple - so far, so good, you may think. After retrieving the piece of the puzzle they came to get, the temple's safety system locks in by bringing a number of stone statues to life. Thus ensues much shooting and battle between humans and rock monsters. Now, I have to say that the CGI that animated these creatures impressed me totally, as they very nearly looked real instead of the badly-created sprites that I'm used to in CGI. If this wasn't enough, the end of the scene is simply breathtaking - as Jolie turns to leave, a huge statue of an ancient God (Kali perhaps?) rises into the air to attack. I haven't been this impressed since Harryhausen's Talos creation in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, with which it shares many similarities, and the effects are seamless. In fact this whole moment is literally breath-taking. It's just a shame the whole movie couldn't have been like this.Otherwise, what we have is a clichéd plot and characters doing things in some international locations. Lots of beautiful backdrops and beautiful people, you know the routine. I was just looking for something substantial. Saying that, TOMB RAIDER is nonetheless a crowd-pleasing film which really must be seen in the cinema (or at least on a large screen television) to get the full effect of the occasionally awesome scenery. Let's hope the inevitable sequels improve upon the concept, although somehow I doubt they will.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
2,SnoopyStyle,"Action good, Story slow",6,29 September 2013,"All the planets of the solar system are going into planetary alignment once every 5,000 years. The Illuminati is searching for an ancient artifact to control time which is time sensitive.Angelina Jolie is Lara Croft a rich adventurer based on the video game. She definitely has the build to be Lara Croft. And she has the presence and the strength of will. She is the best person for the job. The villains are forgettable. Jon Voight plays Lara's dead father. Daniel Craig plays her competitor/love interest Alex West.The action is over the top thrilling stuff. But without the action, the story is prodding and stumbling. Let's face it. The story matters very little just like the video game. It's the action that's the most fun.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
3,gavin6942,"An Interesting Adventure Film, Even if a bit Silly",6,5 December 2015,"Video game adventuress Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) comes to life in a movie where she races against time and villains to recover powerful ancient artifacts.Angelina Jolie has had a strange career. She started out as the daughter of Jon Voight (who plays her father here). Whether that helped her or not, I do not know. But she landed some roles in ""Hackers"" and ""Lara Croft"". She married Brad Pitt, the king of Hollywood. She is seen as a humanitarian and is now (2015) establishing herself as a director. What a career! This film is a little bit silly. The adventure and action is not realistic, but being based on a video game, it probably shouldn't be. Fun? Yes. And apparently quite successful, since it spawned at least one sequel.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
4,jboothmillard,Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,2,12 September 2005,"Many fans of the successful 1996 video game were expecting this live action film to be a good action film, unfortunately it is completely the opposite, directed by Simon West (Con Air, The Machanic, The Expendables 2). Basically Lara Croft (the gorgeous Razzie nominated Angelina Jolie) finds a clock in a hidden room of her mansion, placed there by her father Lord Richard Croft (Jon Voight, Jolie's real father). It contains the key to finding two halves of an ancient triangle which when activated can control time for good or evil. It is Lara's job to find and destroy the two halves of the triangle before Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), along with supposed traitor Alex West (Daniel Craig), get to it first. Also starring Noah Taylor as Bryce, Red Dwarf's Christopher 'Chris' Barrie as Hillary, Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Mr. Pimms and Leslie Phillips as Wilson. Jolie is obviously a terrific actress, she does put on an Elizabeth Hurley (a rumoured contender for the role) style English accent, she is just about suited for the role. But it is a shambles, the supporting cast are wasted, including Craig who puts on a rediculous American accent, the special effects look second-rate and dated, the story is not all that interesting, and only tiny moments of Indiana Jones style stuff are worth a glimpse, all in all it is a pointless action adventure. Angelina Jolie was number 74 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Lara Croft was number 69 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and she was number 6, and Jolie number 1 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (it could have been Marilyn Monroe). Pretty poor!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
5,ccthemovieman-1,The Female Indiana Jones,8,16 July 2006,"Angeline Jolie, gives us the female version of ""Indiana Jones"" in this wild cartoon-like adventure story, which is fun to watch. Being a mentally lightweight action film with no credibility (no villain ever harms Jolie in this film despite firepower that would take out some Third World countries) but our heroine is there to save the day, of course! Jolie mainly is there to show off her chest in tight tee-shirts and perform near-impossible stunts. To her credit, she went to extreme lengths to get herself physically-fit for the role.Audio-wise, this is a one of the better DVDs you will ever hear, with excellent use of the surround speakers. Nice scenery, a sharp picture and low profanity also are pluses. Yes, the action is a little much and too loud in spots but otherwise ""Tomb Raider"" is a fun adventure that is recommended to all.p.s. Skip the sequel; it's a weak one.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
6,Tweekums,A bit silly but good fun with some fine action,7,1 May 2017,"Lady Lara Croft might sound like a prim and proper member of the English upper class but we soon see that she is far from that as she enters what appears to be an ancient tomb and ends up battling a robot while wearing short shorts and a tee shirt that shows of her ample assets! This is just a training sequence to give us an idea what she can do. It turns out that a once in five thousand year planetary alignment is about to happen and a sinister organisation is desperate to get their hands on 'the key' which will enable then to get their hands on the two pieces of an ancient artefact that will allow them to control time itself. It turns out that Lara's late father found the key some time earlier and placed it in her country house. She finds it when it starts ticking and starts trying to find out what it is. This leads her to Manfred Powell who wants the key for himself and soon steals it with the help of a small army of mercenaries. If Lara is to stop him getting his hands on the device she will have to follow him to a temple in Cambodia, Venice then finally to a remote corner of Siberia.If you are looking for something serious you will be a bit disappointed but if you want some good silly fun with plenty of action you could do a lot worse. The story is simple enough with no real surprises but it is told fairly well. Often in this sort of film there is a bit too much forced humour but thankfully this is played fairly straight. There is lots of action and this is rather good; given the films age the CGI still looks pretty decent. Angelina Jolie does an impressive job as our eponymous heroine; it isn't surprising that she went on to play more action leads. The rest of the cast is pretty solid too; notably Daniel Craig and Iain Glen. Having never played the video games I can't say how the character or story compares possibly an advantage as I had no idea what Lara Croft 'should' be like. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting an hour and a half of silly action with little content that could be considered offensive.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
7,ma-cortes,Emotion and adventures with frenetic action,7,18 May 2005,"The film talks upon Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), an explosive and sexy British archaeologist and it results to be an adaptation from a successful and famous video game . Lara musts discover and destroy halves-objects of an old relic which can control time and a nasty (Iain Glen) also wants to obtain it with the aim to ruling the time . Lara Croft is helped by an adventurer (Daniel Craig , future James Bond) and by two sympathetic underlings (Noah Taylor and Christopher Barrie). Her dead father (John Voight, like on the real life) will give up clues to find it . She'll have to take on several risks , dangers and adventures until reach her aim.The picture mingles suspense , tension , skydiving , action-packed , pursuits and a little bit of violence when the quarrel happen but it's a very amusing movie . It's a real and typical action film : Running men while are shooting , continuous struggles in bounds and leaps and interminable runs . It's a run-of-the-mill action picture , as from the beginning to the end , the unstopped action and the fast movement is varied . Besides , there are breathtaking outdoors from different countries around the world where the protagonists are traveling to resolve the issues . The final duel amongst the starring and contenders for the possession of the ancient relics is impressive and groundbreaking . The film is similar to the posterior :¨ the cradle of the life¨ , it has a likeness chum (Daniel Craig-Gerard Butler), equal performers (Noah Taylor and Chris Barrie ) with gorgeous as well as spectacular scenarios . However , the first part achieved a lot of box office and second part (directed by Jan De Bont) attained limited success because the storyline was basically a rehash of the original film . Peter Menzies cinematography is awesome like is marvelously reflected on the extraordinary outdoors and Graeme Revell musical score is jolly and lively . The picture was rightly directed by Simon West.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
8,BA_Harrison,Big hooters and massive shooters a good film do not make.,3,22 September 2013,"Well over a decade has passed since I last saw this film; just enough time for me to forget quite how awful it was.Angelina Jolie might look the part, all pneumatic lips and breasts with a massive pair of hand-cannons strapped to her impossibly strong thighs, but the script is absolute gobbledygook, a boring and unfathomable mess that attempts to mimic the Indiana Jones recipe of pulp action and supernatural mythology—with everything from ancient archaeological artifacts made from meteorites, giant robots, living stone statues, crumbling temples, booby traps, a time machine, and even the frickin' Illuminati for good measure—but which is all so clumsily thrown together that it even makes Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull look like a masterpiece in comparison.Director Simon West pays little attention to logic, pacing or style, preferring to keep things loud and fast for his core gamer audience, utilising sub-par CGI to realise the numerous ridiculous set pieces, during which Croft manages to avoid being crushed, stabbed, or shot while performing gymnastic routines of Olympic standard and taking out countless bad guys with ease.3/10, and that's being generous.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
9,dbdumonteil,"the moral is: rush on the video games, they're much better",5,7 February 2003,"To adapt a video game for the screen is like adapting a comic strip to the screen: the result is rarely convincing. ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" isn't an exception to the rule. When the film was launched in June 2001, it was announced as one of the biggest commercial successes of the summer in France but it didn't meet the expected success (hardly 2 million of spectators in the theaters). However, the publicity campaign was quite important (U2's clip ""elevation"" featuring Lara Croft was released at the same time with the movie. Now concerning the movie, well under its compound subject, the screenplay is a great banality. A sect called ""the Illuminati"" tries to appropriate a talisman that would enable his members to control the whole world and time. But for this, she needs two pieces of a triangle and Lara's got one of them. A mad chase's starting... In short, this is the classical outline specific to adventures movies. Not only was the screenplay inspired by several elements which made the success of this type of movies but it also drew elements from the video game ""Tomb Raider"". For example, in the movie we find: magic objects that assure power to the one's got it, mysterious places (the temple in Cambodia), the struggle between good and evil. This is just a lacklustre movie that doesn't innovate anything in the type of the adventures movie. It could have been another Tomb Raider's adventure on a video game. Moreover, the movie irritates a little by its worthy dialogs and its unlikely special effects. As for Angelina Jolie, she's quite convincing ,physically and morally in the main role. At the end, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is a film without any great surprises, a bit nonchalant and the fans of the video game will maybe find something in it.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
10,Quinoa1984,"Less than great, but why completely carp?",6,15 June 2001,"Lara Croft is played very well by Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider, where her character isn't as demanding as the ones she has had in the past.  She has fun with her role, and being one of the best looking women in Hollywood, it is worth it to see her all sexy and all (the guys will like that aspect over the action I bet).The story is so lame, contrived and non-sensical, it might be just as well to give up trying to find anything logical and take the Spaz look at it (obscure O & A reference) in just some action, effects and large heaving boobs.  While the action is well plotted in good locations and setting, the suspense is very, very thin, which is strange for this type of movie.  It's almost like we don't care what's going to happen because most of us have been down this genre road before (last month's Mummy 2, for example), and we know the outcome better than a fixed poker game.  Plus, the opening steals the show. Action filled with fun in absurdity to go around, but it is very far from a great popcorn movie.  But at least Jolie is hot.  Jolie's real life dad Voight plays her on-screen dad here.  B (like it's genre)",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
11,michaelRokeefe,This tomb raider knows how to get the job done.,6,16 June 2001,Finally a video game movie that is worth seeing. Sultry Angelina Jolie plays the butt kicking tomb raider Lara Croft. Our heroine is an acrobatic English miss that turns warrior. The sexy and lethal damsel can more than take care of herself as she sets out to save the world from an ancient curse. Croft discovers that her late father(Jon Voight)has left her clues to a mysterious puzzle that takes her from one end of the earth to another...Cambodia and Iceland.Tons of energy drained; plenty of action; and the attitude and posturing of the beautiful Jolie make for a very entertaining movie. Next time out let us have some stronger and fearsome foes for Croft to do away with.Note: this is the first movie to feature Miss Jolie with her accomplished father(Voight).,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
12,Theo Robertson,I`m Not Missing The Point,5,12 January 2003,"This struck me as involving as watching someone play a video game . Before everyone sends me a private message saying LARA CROFT:TOMB RAIDER is based on a video game that`s not really the point I`m making . The point is a film should stand on its own hind legs weather it`s based on a book , stage play , television series or in this case a computer game . Every film should have realistic characters and an involving story regardless of its source . The characters in this are just names who never act in a realistic manner , for example there`s a scene where the bad guys are in mortal danger but never register any fear as you might expect but just open fire . This is just typical of the film which consists of explosions , gun fights , stunts and nothing else . There`s only two decent things in TOMB RAIDER and both belong to Angelina Jolie Note to Jon Voight. Change your agent",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
13,preppy-3,"Stupid plot, good action",5,30 July 2001,"The plot is vague and a there's a lot of unexplained events (i.e. Early on in the film, Lara Croft finds a secret room with no explination of how she knew where it was or why she's so interested in it) but the movie sort of works.  The action scenes are exciting and very well-done, the special effects are great and none of the actors take the movie seriously for one second.  Other than that, the movie is pretty bad.  The plot keeps popping up and Angelina Jolie has one of the worst English accents I've ever heard. So, see it at a matinee or wait for the DVD or video.  It's not worth 9 or 10 bucks.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
14,poolandrews,Average computer game based action film.,5,12 April 2010,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider starts as a group known as The Illuminati desperately seek the ancient timepiece that counts down to the alignment of the nine planets of our solar system that happens once every five thousand years, they need the timepiece to find two halves of a sacred triangle forged centuries ago from the molten metal of a meteorite & grants the possessor the power over time. In a huge mansion in England tomb raider Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) hears a strange ticking behind a wall & finds the timepiece The Illuminati are seeking although she has no idea what it is, Lara visits a lawyer named Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) who is actually working for The Illuminati & subsequently steals the timepiece from Lara. Once Lara realises what is at stake it's a race against time to get the timepiece back, recover the two halves of the triangle & prevent The Illuminati or anyone else from altering time...This American, British, German & Japanese co-production was directed by Simon West & was based on the popular mid 90's computer Game Tomb Raider & it's star Lara Croft, while computer game adaptations have been hit & miss Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is a rather average action film that is watchable enough but nothing special. To be honest while I was watching Lara Croft: Tomb Raider last night I kept thinking about Indiana Jones with he whole magical ancient relic of legend of some sort as an organisation of bad guy's want ti for evil while a lone archaeological action star has to save the day in a globe-trotting adventure to various temples ancient ruined cities. Also, the whole rich superhero who lives in a huge mansion & has an understanding butler reminded me of Batman as well. So basically Lara Croft: Tomb raider is a female combination of Indiana Jones & Batman all wrapped up in a fairly basic computer game inspired action film, sure it moves along at a cracking pace & there's plenty of action but it's a very shallow film with very little going on underneath the action set-pieces & cool iconic posing & posturing. While not terrible Lara Croft: Tomb Raider isn't great & I will have probably forgotten most of it by the end of the week.The action scenes are pretty cool from shoot-outs to martial arts fights to a bungee ballet to a potentially great scene in an ancient temple as various stone statues come to life including a huge six armed woman (similar to the one seen in The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974)) that disappointingly doesn't get to do a thing, it just stands there for a few seconds before being defeated. The CGI computer effects could have been better & look a little dated now. The sets & ancient temple designs are great & it's obvious a lot of time & money went into the visuals with plenty of stylistic posing but as I have already said there's not much else to the film. Apparently this is the most financially successful action film with a female in the lead role which is actually sort of sad to know. The violence is constant but not that graphic.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it & it shows with nice production values, exotic filming locations & huge set-piece action scenes. This was the first Hollywood film shot in Cambodia for thirty years. The acting is OK, Jolie is alright while her on screen father is played by her real life father Jon Voight. Jolie is American while her character Croft is British while Croft's boyfriend who is American is played by Danie Craig who is British.Lara Croft: Tomb raider is an alright big budget action film based on a computer game, it's not the best film out there but it's not the worst either if you just want to waste 100 odd minutes. Followed by Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003).",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
15,lastliberal,Into the belly of the beast.,6,15 December 2007,"There doesn't have to be a lot of story to get me to spend 100 minutes watching Angelina Jolie. I really can't think of a better use of my time. There is just no one who looks better in an Indiana Jones type role. She is incredibly perfect.There was, however, enough story and some incredible special effects that made this must more enjoyable than just seeing Ms. Jolie. There was also some humor, and some great monsters.It was also interesting to see her acting with Jon Voight. I guess they put their differences aside for the film.I shamelessly admit I went to Beowulf to see her, and I watched this again just to see her, too.

16,zardoz-13,"""Lara Croft"" Digs Her Own Grave in ""Tomb Raider""",6,25 June 2008,"Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie of ""Girl, Interrupted"" stands out as a feast for the eyes as sexy, two-gun toting, cyber-heroine Lara Croft in British director Simon West's adventure opus ""Tomb Raider"" with Daniel Craig, Jon Voight, and Iain Glenn. Lenser Peter Menzies' spectacular widescreen cinematography, Kirk M. Petruccelli's lofty production designs, and the exotic travelogue scenery of Cambodia and Iceland round out this radiant visual treat. If good looks alone guaranteed great movies, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" might have given ""Indiana Jones"" a real run for his archeology. Alas, this pretentious, predictable, and poorly scripted $90-million, big-screen version of the popular, estrogen-driven, feminist-oriented video game substitutes extravaganza for the white-knuckled thrills of its arcade namesake. Simon West, whose directorial credentials include ""The General's Daughter"" and ""Con Air,"" and a quintet of scenarists shoulder the lion's share of the blame for this misbegotten melodramatic mishmash.Not only do top-notch action epics require a challenging adversary, but these movies also should boast some semblance of a coherent plot to tie together its scenes. Fastidious Iain Glen never makes a concrete impression as Lara's archenemy. He pales in comparison with other villains that audiences love to hate, such as Darth Vader in ""Star Wars"" (1977), Deebo in ""Friday"" (1995) or Clarence Boddicker in ""RoboCop"" (1987). Furthermore, the synthetic, by-the-numbers screenplay by writing duo Patrick Massett and John Zinman of TV's ""Friday Night Lights"" gives neither Glen nor Jolie anything truly memorable to do as the action lurches awkwardly from one elaborate set-piece showdown to another. Sadly, ""Tomb Raider"" degenerates into a worldwide scavenger hunt without a sufficient number of either cliffhanger moments or audacious stunts to distract us from the dire mechanics of its half-baked plot.Repeatedly, characters remind us that everything occurs in a week's time, but West drums up negligible suspense about this critical time element. Imagine the Bruce Willis bomb ""Hudson Hawk"" (1991) crossed with the woebegone 1996 version of ""The Phantom"" with Billy Zane, and you can guess just how episodic and ill-conceived this globe-trotting, bullet-riddled, supernatural saga is. Worse, when one character argues mankind lacks the moral capability to handle the secret in ""Tomb Raider,"" our video-game inspired vixen ignores his warning. Clearly, West and his scribes have forgotten the familiar adage: ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it."" Although I known little about the ""Tomb Raider"" video game, friends have told me it essentially concerns the exploits of a woman who relies on her sharp-shooting skills to survive an obstacle course. If this is truly the case, West and company should have developed ""Mad Max"" style shenanigans instead of the grown-up Nancy Drew antics depicted in the film.The problem with ""Tomb Raider"" is West never allows its overblown excesses to celebrate its hokey histrionics, like the ""Batman"" movies. Late action helmer Don Siegel of ""Dirty Harry"" fame once said when a film cannot justify its own ends, then it should constitute an end in itself by its sheer operatic dimensions. ""Tomb Raider"" contains its share of big scenes, but the filmmakers pass up every opportunity to wallow in excess for the sake of excess. Worse, the film provides Lara with two potential sources of comedy: a nerdy Q-type computer whiz Bryce (Noah Taylor of ""Shine"") and an Alfred-style butler Hilary (Christopher Barrie, best known as Rimmer in British TV's ""Red Dwarf"") but get little mileage out of either guy.The first mistake that West makes is with the pointless prologue. When bubble-breasted Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie with a serviceable English accent) isn't our saving the universe from evil, she hones her combat skills in a funhouse setting within her palatial, 82-room, English country manor. Lara pits herself against a monstrous ""RoboCop"" cyborg. Like the ""Pink Panther"" comedies where the hero repulses the surprise attacks of his Asian house boy, Lara contends with a robot which never relents. She blasts away with two automatic pistols in defiance at this shiny, metallic beast, but nothing can stop it. Finally, she tires of the exercise and reprograms it as a giant juke box. So much for suspense! Because Lara was never actually in peril, this opening scene lacks potency. Moreover, she achieves nothing by pouring a fusillade of bullets into the robot, because they glance off it as harmlessly as pebbles. As fabulously wealthy as ""Batman's"" Bruce Wayne, Croft wants for nothing, but grieves for her long lost father, Lord Richard Croft (Jolie's real-life dad Jon Voight of ""Midnight Cowboy"") who has been missing since 1985 and presumed dead. This father-daughter relationship constitutes the only feature that makes Lara appear remotely sympathetic. Otherwise, she emerges as a snotty little girl with nothing better to do than race around the world plundering artifacts and behaving like a cock tease.Lara matches wits, fists, and lead with a ruthless antiquities dealer, Manfred Powell (Iain Glen of ""The Young Americans""), who travels in the lap of luxury with his own private army of trigger-happy mercenaries. These goons probably fire more bullets than were discharged in the two World Wars, and they still cannot hit Lara! Appropriately taciturn and saturnine, Powell has villainous inclinations that are never fully realized. When Lara and he meet initially, he spouts the best line in the movie: ""My ignorance amuses me."" Exciting as it all sounds, ""Tomb Raider"" gets so wound up with its convoluted travesty of a plot that the action often grinds to a halt for long, verbose stretches of mind-numbing exposition about astronomy. Occasionally, West proves that he can helm big action scenes. The best and only example occurs early on when Manfred's henchmen invade Croft Manor and a pajama-clad Lara resists them with a bungee cord and a motorcycle. Nevertheless, compared to Hong Kong chick flick thrillers produced a decade ago, even this hellacious scene breaks no new ground. The rest of ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" qualifies as anti-climactic, illogical drivel over which not even Angelina Jolie can triumph.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
17,Boba_Fett1138,Enjoyable silly action movie.,7,17 June 2005,"This movie is good as pure mindless entertainment.Yes, of course it's a complete Indiana Jones wannabee and rip-off at times but just like the movies made in the same period, ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", it's a fun and at times good rip-off.It amazes me to be honest how many people complain about the plot holes and the lack of realism of the movie. Well no offense but when you want realism you shouldn't watch a movie based on a video game in the first place. The story of the movie isn't really of much importance, it's just an excuse to bring some action to the screen and the action is something that most certainly does not disappoint. The action sequences are nicely executed and highly original. So the movie just simply serves its purpose; to bring some mindless entertainment.This movie is much better than its sequel ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"", even though both movies are just silly, this movie at least isn't sloppy made and has far superior action sequences and less silly and unlikely moments. Guess that means that Simon West is a better action director as Jan de Bont is.The cast & crew are great. Angelina Jolie is a great and wonderful Lara Croft and the movie has a nice atmosphere and is edited well together. The special effects were good and enjoyable and never were overused in any scene.The villains are a bit underused and uninteresting but somehow in this case it doesn't disturb me. I also missed some good humor at times, for some reason I have a feeling that the movie would had been better if it was written by British writers.

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Average, only really enjoyable by Tomb Raider fans",6,12 February 2004,"This has some similarities to Indiana Jones films, the only big difference is that the hero is female. The plot is OK, only a little more ridiculous than typically for the adventure genre. The acting is average, no Oscar performances and no horrible performances either. The special effects are pretty good, but nothing fascinating. Something that annoyed me a bit was the fact that there seemed to be more attention devoted to finding 'exciting' locations for the film than the action sequences. The action is mostly average, but with just a little more work, they could have been so much better. I doubt that typical adventure/Indiana Jones fans will really enjoy this, it seems to be made primarily to satisfy the fans of the video-games. On a final note, if you do enjoy this movie, you should check out the DVD. It has loads of good special features. I would only recommend this to big fans of the games, since it doesn't offer anything you wouldn't find in pretty much any other film, apart from stuff that only the fans would enjoy. 6/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
19,view_and_review,Lady Lara Croft not Good on Screen,4,4 June 2014,"I just recently watched Maleficent and saw how Angelina Jolie commanded the screen so I figured I'd watch Lara Croft, a movie I'd never seen. Well... I didn't even finish the movie. I guess it was just such a huge drop off that I didn't have the patience to watch it until completion.I had zero knowledge about Lara Croft the video game or the movie before watching it. I guess she's a wealthy female version of Indiana Jones with more agility, smoother skin, and a British accent.It's an action movie, I get it; but even with that I cut it off when Lara Croft was dodging multiple machine guns firing at her. One guy shooting at you with a machine gun and you outrun him, OK... several guys with machine guns that you not only outrun, but also dismantle without a weapon: I'm tapping out.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
20,gridoon2021,A great Angelina Jolie in an OK adventure,6,23 April 2010,"As many others have said, the best thing about the first ""Tomb Raider"" movie is by far its leading star, Angelina Jolie. She does a great job with both the physical and the emotional aspects of Lara Croft: her training and conditioning paid off, and she manages to give flesh and blood to a video game character. Her supporting cast is much like the movie: OK but nothing special. Iain Glen is an adequately slimy villain, but James Bond-to-be Daniel Craig doesn't really strike much of an impact. There are some cool action sequences (when they don't go overboard with CGI), with Lara counting in equal parts on her skills and her smarts, but the story lacks the urgency it should have (considering the entire course of history is supposed to be at stake), and its most interesting mystical parts (like a mysterious ghost-like little girl who is able to read Lara's thoughts) are under-developed. Even the time-manipulation rules are not very clear - Lara is told by her father that she is not allowed to use the power of the Triangle and yet she does use it once before destroying it. To repeat my opening statement: Jolie is wonderful to watch, the movie is just passable. **1/2 out of 4.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
21,anaconda-40658,The Tomb is Empty.,1,25 June 2015,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001): Dir: Simon West / Cast: Angelina Jolie, Noah Taylor, Jon Voight, Daniel Craig, Richard Johnson: Based on a popular video game providing viewers with stunts and special effects with as little story as possible. Perhaps the producers raided a tomb to find this screenplay without realizing that a plot this dumb was buried for a good reason. Angelina Jolie plays Lara Croft who begins the film with one of many mindless action scenes. She finds a clock that contains a strange object. She is then off to obtain two halves of a triangle that are located at opposite ends of the earth. She must destroy them before they are used to control time. This is apparently done when the planets are aligned together. Director Simon West hasn't the slightest idea what he's doing with this big budget circus act. To his credit he at least takes on projects of different genres. Aside from this he directed the suspenseful The General's Daughter and the embarrassing action crap fest Con Air. Jolie spends much time in bemused combat. Jon Voight provides the only real character as her father, and their scene together is perhaps the one good scene. Noah Taylor and Daniel Craig are at the mercy of cardboard material. Richard Johnson plays someone billed as the Distinguished Gentlemen. The only thing distinguished here is a bad career move. Pointless video game spectacle should be buried in a tomb. Score: 1 ½ / 10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
22,Aaron1375,A fun movie to watch!,9,30 October 2001,"Sure it isn't an oscar winner, but I really enjoyed this flick.  Jolie is great as Laura Croft.  There are problems with the film, however, one of which is the lack of any other memorable characters.  This is ok though, because I paid to see Jolie.  The movie could have used one more action sequence as well and she could have used her guns more at the end, but all in all it was a fun film to watch.  I loved the fact that in the one temple the stone guardian came to life just as in the tomb raider 3 game.  There is also a great fight sequence in her home as well.

This film is like the Morphin Power Rangers, except Lara Croft is a power ranger of one.  The movie's plot makes about as much sense as  a Morphen Power Ranger show.  Stupid would be a compliment for this film.  What I really hate is how they copy Raiders of the Lost Ark.  How could a producer mix Morphen Power Rangers with such a classic.

24,Mr-Fusion,"They picked the right actress, she just needed a better script",5,23 June 2015,"I really liked ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" when it first came out; it seemed to defy the stigma surrounding video game movies. Fourteen years later? Ehh, not so much. The action scenes stink of ""Matrix"" rip-off and consist mostly of Angelina Jolie shooting at stuff, reloading, and shooting some more. Not a whole lot of adventuring here. Then again, it's been so long since I've played a Tomb Raider game, maybe that's what it always was. What do I know? What I do know is that this movie is surprisingly lifeless. More noisy than exciting, and there's a strange emptiness to all of it. Jolie looked the part, but there was nothing to work with. Hers is just one in an cast of dull characters.5/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

26,JamesHitchcock,A robot on autopilot could have made a better film,4,20 November 2013,"Video games have in recent years been a frequent source of inspiration for action/adventure films, although it must be said that few of the resulting movies have been any good, the recent ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" probably being the best that I have seen. (There have been some dire examples, ""Street Fighter"" being a particularly egregious one). The successful Tomb Raider series, dating back to 1996, boasts in its beautiful heroine Lara Croft one of the most instantly recognisable characters from any video game, familiar to many who have never played the game itself, so a film adaptation was inevitable. For promotional purposes Lara has been impersonated by many young actresses and models; in the late nineties the young British actress Rhona Mitra was frequently promoted as the ""face of Lara Croft"". The film-makers, however, evidently wanted someone more internationally famous, but although they cast the American actress Angelina Jolie in the role they resisted the temptation to make Lara an American. As in the game, she remains a British aristocrat living in a stately home with a butler. The plot is largely based upon the ""Indiana Jones"" formula, with a few influences imported from the James Bond series. Like Indy, Lara is an archaeologist whose scientific expeditions always end up turning into an adventure, generally because she has stumbled across an artifact with mystical powers. There will also be a gang of bad guys in search of the said artifact, which they need in order to achieve their goal of world domination, a goal which it falls to our intrepid heroine to thwart. That synopsis would fit both the Lara Croft films; indeed, with a change in the sex of the leading character it would also fit most of the Indiana Jones films. (The one exception is ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", the weakest entry in that particular franchise). In ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" the mysterious artifact is a metal triangle with the power to control time and the bad guys seeking it are the Illuminati, that secretive group beloved of all conspiracy theorists. Another theme in the film concerns Lara's relationship with her father Lord Richard, who died when she was young, and who it turns out was murdered by the Illuminati. Richard is played by Jon Voight, who is of course Angelina's father in real life. As I said, there are also a few Bond influences, such as the use of several exotic locations- here Venice, Cambodia and Siberia- in the one film. Just as Bond has his ""Bond Girls"", so Lara has her ""Croft Boys"", and the Croft Boy in this film is Alex West, played by Daniel Craig who of course himself later took over the role of 007. Alex is an American; there cannot be many films in which an American actress plays a British character and a British actor plays an American one. Angelina copes well with the British accent, although she perhaps does not sound quite upper-class enough for Lara's supposed background. (Foreign actresses called upon to play a British character are more often guilty of the opposite fault, that of making someone from a working-class background sound like a Duchess). In general, however, Angelina's performance is quite a good one, showing that she has the looks, charisma and physical presence to play a role like this. A sequel named ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" was released in 2003. Despite its clumsy title and the law which states that sequels are generally inferior to their originals, it is actually the better of the films by a considerable margin, giving the lovely Angelina a vehicle more worthy of her talents. Unfortunately, she is the only thing about the original film that is any good. None of the other actors, including Voight and Craig, make much of an impression, but the film's two biggest problems are the way it is written and the way it is directed. The script went through many drafts produced by several writers; the producers were presumably unaware of the adage ""when in a hole, stop digging"". Frenetic attempts to take a bad script and make it better frequently have the effect of making it even worse. In the event, five writers including director Simon West are credited with the final version, and this hotchpotch of nonsense certainly has the feel of something produced by a committee. As for the direction, West seems to have made the mistake of assuming that because the film was based on a video game he needed to reproduce the furious, hectic style of one. The opening scene features a robot named SIMON, and I wondered if this was a reference to the director's Christian name. If so, it seems like an apt one; a robot on autopilot could have directed a better film than this one. 4/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

But I gave Tomb Raider a chance and over all it's one of the better video game adaptations I have seen in a while. Angelina, I'm sorry to the fans, she's not that hot in my opinion, and probably the only reason she got a boost of fame was because of that shower scene. :P But anywho, the stunts she did were incredible and she did a very decent job of acting and kicking butt.

In one scene there is a fight involving a bunji harness in Croft's mansion where Jolie swings around doing little martial arts moves, kicking bad guys, and zipping around on the cord. I liked this scene because it was very original. But then there're other scenes and monologue that are just out of place.The end pretty much messed up the rest of what I DID enjoy out of this film. It was utterly ridiculous, not in the ways of ""she could never do that"" but more of a really dumb plot ending. Perhaps the sequel will be better than this. I sure hope so.It seems most of the time the director of this film was too focused on getting teen males to enjoy the film by zooming and/or focusing on Angie's tight, short clothes, and *ahem* ""big"" chest(how else to put it-it's true) rather than giving the audience an interesting storyline.Tomb Raider is worth viewing once, just for the fact there're some scenes very interesting and original, but just fast forward the last 30, dull and ridiculous minutes. 2/5 stars-",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

However, director Simon West gave the film his unique flavor and twist that made this a good stand-alone movie.The movie's special effects were good for the most part, but thought that the CGI effects for some of the moving cave creatures were too unrealistic, and the acting was also OK for the most part, sans some campy dialog.

There's even a very good Boss fight at the end.The script, on the other hand, is abysmal. No one who writes a script like this has any right to be in the movie-making business.It's not a great movie, but I'd say it's fun enough to watch some lazy afternoon.

33,bensonmum2,Disappointing,5,13 March 2005,"Based on the popular video game series Tomb Raider, Lara Croft is a wealthy archaeologist who travels the world seeking ancient artifacts. In this movie, Lara is racing against the Illuminati (a secret society seeking world control) to find the two parts of a device that, when put together, allows the possessor the ability to control time. To save the world, Lara must get there first.Several years ago, I was a huge fan of the Playstation series. I would sit and play each game for several days (or weeks) until I had entirely completed it. So, when I first read the news about a movie based on my favorite game, I was very excited. Probably too excited. There is just no way a movie could have ever met my lofty expectations. And, for the most part, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider didn't come close. Having watched it again for the first time since its theatrical release, I realize that while it's not as bad as I first thought, it's still not a very good movie.The real problem I have with the movie is the lack of adventure. The fun in playing the game was the search for the lost relic. Actually finding the relic could be anticlimactic. In the movie, everything seems to come too easy. To find the first half of the device, Lara points to a spot on the map in South East Asia and bam - she immediately finds the temple with the first half. For the second half, Lara travels to Siberia. Inside a very small ice cave, Lara knocks down one wall and bam - there's the second half. No searching. No mystery. No adventure. And this leads to no fun.The biggest plus is the casting of Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft. From the first moment she appears on screen, she IS Lara Croft.

35,ThomasDrufke,"It's Fun, but Seriously Dated",4,21 March 2018,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is one of those movies that is very difficult to go back and re-watch. It's not just because the special effects are more than dated or that the story feels very generic, it's because the Hollywood we knew in 2001 is very different from the Hollywood we know now. This movie would be absolutely ripped to shreds if it came out now, and to a certain extent it was back then as well. I'm sorry, but you can't just get away with having a mind-blowingly pointless shower scene and that other thing they shamelessly did to enhance Lara. Yeah, that doesn't fly.It's also interesting just to look at this film as a product of its age because of how much it feels like it's trying to be something that it's not. Tomb Raider is supposed to be an adventure first and action second type of franchise. Or at least that's always the way I viewed it. But this film rips so many pages out from the playbook of The Matrix and other 90's classic action movies and tries to weave a halfway decent adventure story into the film as well. Having the Illuminati as the 'big bad' of the film is one thing, but silly CGI flooded sequences with zero weight behind them is a whole other problem the film faces.But I think the thing that this film does most poorly is flush out Lara Croft as her own character. If you look at her in the first scene and the last scene, there really isn't much growth or difference as to how she does about her life. In order for there to be a point to making the film, there needs to be some sort of growth or arc, or else what was really accomplished in the end?4.2/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Yes, they literally thought that Jolie did not have a large enough cleavage to play Lara Croft. I'm surprised more people don't mention that. To be fair, she does look a lot like her here and more or less acts like her. A big problem with this movie is the pacing. I thought the fight in the middle seemed like the climax.The CGI wasn't bad at first but in the later parts of the movie, it really looked stupid and that was distracting. Still, the fight scenes they do have aren't bad. It does get pretty dumb at the end as it shows Lara climbing up this pyramid and meeting with her father. I'm sorry, but I'll never be able to look at the Eye of the Illuminati again without thinking of Bill Cipher. ""Gravity Falls"" was just that awesome of a show.

Negatives: 
1. The puzzle solving in the game was much more challenging than the all to common & typical movie weird little rotating disk antiquity device combined w/rotating circular door.

45,johnnyboyz,"If it raids anything at all, it's the file in the cabinet marked 'dumb-dumb summer action movie conventions'.",4,13 September 2010,"If you cast your mind back to the era of this film's inception and more importantly, if you are able to, strain to remember the Tomb Raider video games of around about said time then you'll recall episodic adventures of a heroine named Lara Croft jumping and hopping from global locale to global locale thwarting gun toting villains and some of the more hostile wildlife known to humankind. Of the games that I played in the series, most were rather repetitive; sparked into life only by the odd driving of a vehicle for whatever reason or the fighting off of a 'boss' during which nouse and tactics were unusually inserted into the game. For the most part, venturing from A to B; hopping; jumping; swimming; shooting and the working out of puzzles usually involving keys and levers were the norm, it's just that doing so in a jungle; a temple; a mountain range and a submarine station amongst many others masked the effective repetition of the game. Simon West's 2001 'adaptation' of the Tomb Raider series is intrinsically linked to the game series of then-1996 to 2001 in name and lead character only, and in a video gaming franchise that saw so much of the same content played out, it's funny how routine consistency and simplistic clarity in what's happening are the two things we bay for most when watching his film.Lara Croft: Tomb Raider covers the exploits of a young bored-by-day heroine isolated in a large mansion, as she grieves for her father Richard whom went ""missing in the field"" some years ago and keeps company within the vicinity in the form of butler Hillary (Barrie) along with hermited technological whizz Bryce (Taylor), whom curiously lives out back in his own version of Q's workshop based in a caravan. The lead is the titular Lara Croft, played by Angelina Jolie. Croft seems to spend her days reenacting what we can only presume to be a denouement to an archaeological mission, before being attacked by a purpose built robot whom will stop at nothing to kill her; archaeology and the notion of ancient artifact discovery in films such as these are given a sexy and rejuvenating makeover, essentially turned from long and painstaking digs in the third world to causality driven globe hopping adventures, the sorts of which almost always culminates in a would-be snatching of the item you've been searching for from a booby trapped temple. On occasion, her butler will maddeningly walk into her office and place folders down on her desk that we presume to be archaeological 'jobs' or 'missions' which she will then pick and choose at her discretion.Eventually, her role in the film will be more expansively linked to the goings on of the Illuminati; a shady group of mysterious busybodies whose base of operations is in Venice and sees them charge fellow employee, the shady Manfred Powell (Glen) who comes complete with a wiry haircut and a wardrobe of black and whose assistant is the laughably named Mr. Pimms, with finding parts of a magical triangular artifact which will have a great affect on a fore-coming planetary alignment – something that happens once every 5,000 years. Along for the ride is American Alex West (Craig), a character whom shares a seemingly mutual appreciation for Lara and I guess must sit alone in his large house waiting for the folders to land on his desk. The exposition is shameless; the tone basic when it isn't manipulative in its presenting us with a room full of bad guys whom dish out threats to their higher-ups told to do dirty work for them and its all round execution just drab. All the usual frustrations with these sorts of films rear their ugly heads, ranging from a special ops. team charged with executing Lara by nightfall whilst in her mansion but unable hit anything with their gunfire to the filmmakers own transgressional punishment of their lead in Croft; who's a female allowed to drive a film, adopt some kind of role model archetype but has to wear skimpy outfits in the process as her actual action sequences carry an eroticised surge to them. Croft takes everything disturbingly in her stride, inadvertently calling to mind a better film of this ilk in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark when she informally shoots down a stone gargoyle whom has come to life and poses a great threat to her. I liked it more when Indy's face off with a swordsman in said film played out in a market square.The film is grossly uneven in tone, it appears to play everything for laughs; nudges and winks for the early part before branching off into a more serious, more 'grown up' realm later on when personal stakes are suddenly raised and some pretty would-be affecting content to do with a dead parental figure crawls its way into the text. West thinks he can take the film from being a high-flying brainless actioner before bringing everything down a few levels for more heartfelt, more personal sequences when a dream-come-fantasy sequence with her father is supposed to act as a heart tugging catalyst. It's unfortunate on Jolie's behalf that, when the time comes to go face to face with Jon Voight's Lord Richard who is her father-for-the-film just as he is in reality, she forgets to actually react to it all. Bryce's own persistent put-downs and self reflective jabs at the situations the characters find themselves in is one of a few nails in the film's ultimate coffin, a film whose wheels totally come off towards the end but by which time all interest has dissipated and all narrative clarity has imploded. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is rather a tame effort, a film that tries to hit too many marks all too often as sub plots and set pieces are sporadically picked up on and included along the way; but director West can only render the experience grossly underwhelming.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
46,filipemanuelneto,It is not as bad as it is usually said.,5,22 January 2020,"I'm not exactly the type of person who likes movies based on computer games. There is always something that doesn't go very well. This film confirms that. It's not entirely bad, it has enough action to entertain us, but it's not the type of film I think is excellent.The script is based on the travels and adventures of Lara Croft, a trained and beautiful English noblewoman who travels around the world in search of the rarest historical and mystical artifacts. It is a kind of Indiana Jones with skirts, or rather, shorts. Of course, archeology has nothing to do with theft and violation of tombs or temples or whatever, but the film, like the game, doesn't care about that. In this film, she has to fight the Illuminati, which seeks a long-lost artifact but, when reconstituted, would allow it to control Time. Without knowing it, she had a part of the artifact all the time, because her late father, whose death was never clear, had taken that object. Then, the adventure comes to her.The plot is quite simple and not very credible, but those looking for these films usually don't care about that. It is all just a pretext to go to a jungle in a lost corner of the world and kick and shoot some bad guys. The fast pace of the film, associated with good action scenes where, as always, Lara Croft escapes danger by a hair, helps us to swallow and keeps us entertained. Without having to think too much (if we make the film it falls apart), the film goes on until the end, giving us a series of special effects that are not very interesting and clearly made on a computer.Angelina Jolie needed money and notoriety. After a career started from the bottom, in short films and on TV, she had looked good in ""Bone Collector"" but it was ""60 Seconds"" that allowed her to become a sex symbol if she wanted to. This film consolidated that, giving notoriety to the actress' big breasts and allowing her to rise in her career and solidify her stardom. The fact that she was the only actress with some dramatic talent in this film helped her. The support cast was practically demoted to extras with lines. In fact, although the film took advantage of Jolie's generous physical attributes, she showed that she was not just a woman with a desirable body. There was talent there and the ability to do more, if given the right role. This was a sure bet, as the future would show.The film is no wonder, but it is not as bad as it was said. If you look for a movie just to entertain without having to think hard and be watching it carefully, that kind of movie we see while talking to someone or doing something else, this will be a good bet.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Miss Croft is a loner almost neurotic while Indy is a sociable fellow. Miss Croft relies too much on her guns while Indy relies too much on his whip. Indy goes after an iconic relic while Croft runs after an exotic gadget.But i don't want to break this movie because I liked it. It's the only franchise i saw totally abroad, this first part in Netherlands, the sequel in Madrid.If the story is really less thrilling than the ""real"" raider, lacks a big showdown and have dull clichés (the missing mother, the missing father, the ex-boyfriend turned traitor), nevertheless, the cast, the directing and the locations are top notch.For one time, the action is very well sequenced because we can follow easily what happens.

Yes, both movies (Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life)) are far from perfect but at least they tried to capture the spirit of the games - character- and story-wise. Alicia Vikander may be a good looking woman and a decent actor but she is in no way Lara Croft (that ""modernized"" Lara is just plain terrible). Anyway, as most movie adaptions of games are rather total fails or subpar, both Tomb Raider movies starring Angelina are solid adventure and action food.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
50,Anonymous_Maxine,The biggest disappointment of the summer.,5,7 August 2001,"I don't play video games, so I don't know anything about the Tomb Raider game or anything like that, so it played no role in the formation of my opinion about the movie. I had very high expectations for the film, because I know how popular Tomb Raider (and, probably even more, Lara Croft) is, and because I know that a tremendous amount of preparation went into the making of the film. And besides that, Angelina Jolie stars as Lara Croft, and she pulls off the physical aspect of that role (face it, Lara Croft's body is even more well known than the game itself) with stunning closeness.There is a mediocre story in the film involving Croft's search for an artifact that carries with it tremendous power, including the ability to control time, if I remember correctly. Fueling Croft's efforts to achieve the artifact is her determination to live up to the legacy of her late father, played with a little tongue in cheek by her real life father, John Voigt.The story of Tomb Raider was not too impressive to begin with, and Angelina can barely pull off the fake accent (I shudder every time I anticipate Original Sin), but this is not what ultimately brings the movie down. Normally I try not to pick movies apart, but there was so much unnecessary stuff thrown in here that it makes you wonder what people were doing for all of the years that this movie was in production. It seems weird that no one noticed how weird it is to have Lara's father looking at the movie camera and talking, as though to her, while she reads a letter that her wrote her before he died. And also, whose idiot idea was it to have her do things like punch a guy in the head with the back tire of a motorcycle while she speeds by on the front wheel?! What a joke.On the other hand, every scene in which Lara handles guns is incredibly well done. I think that, for the most part, this is because Angelina just looks good pointing two guns and firing them that fast. The beginning action scene was pretty impressive for this reason. The action in the film was mostly pretty good, but there were several instances where it went over the top, as in the above-mentioned motorcycle scene. This is the same problem that we saw in Mission: Impossible II, which could otherwise have been a good action movie, as Tomb Raider could also have been.I don't know enough about the game to comment on how well it was translated to the screen, but I do know from pictures of Lara Croft that Angelina did an excellent job in the role. There can be no mistake that the movie is directed at a younger audience (which makes you wonder about that brief half-nude scene), which probably accounts for most of the goofy action sequences, so be advised of a certain inherent immaturity before you watch it. It's an entertaining enough movie, but be warned.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
51,Vartiainen,Enjoyable fun,8,23 December 2013,"It's hard to imagine what this movie would have been if Angelina Jolie hadn't agree to take the leading role. Because in a very real sense she is the perfect Lara Croft. She has the looks, the charisma, the attitude and the believability to play a hardcore female action hero. At that time she was probably the only one that could have made this movie work, so it's lucky that they got her. The end result is a fun little action film, full of great action scenes, beautiful locations and a plot that falls just on the side of cool instead of silly.Jolie is easily the best part of this film. And why shouldn't she be, it's a movie about her character so it stands to reason that she should be the main focus, and luckily this is one of the few female action hero films that don't try to water the main lead down by adding needless secondary male heroes. There are of course male characters, one of them even a love interest for Lara, but the filmmakers realized that when you have an actress of Jolie's repertoire, you can and you should keep the focus on her, which they do. One of the rare films where you don't have to doubt the badassery of its leading lady for even one second. And I love it for it.The rest of the film is okay. Nothing really stands out, except for the breathtaking locations, but nothing really falls short either. The plot is a bit of a hit and miss. If you can enjoy a good popcorn flick every now and then, I think you're going to enjoy this one as well, but if you have high expectations as far as logic and rationality go, this one isn't for you. It's meant to be enjoyed, not analyzed to death.So, do I enjoy this film? Oh yes. Is it a good film? Not really. It has a few too many plot holes, inconsistencies and general silly moments for me to call it good. What it is, is a lot of fun. One of the better popcorn/adventure flicks I know and the only one with a great female lead.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
52,FiendishDramaturgy,Great Action. Great Movie.,7,21 October 2003,"The hype, the merchandising, the tagline, and even the box this movie came in, promised Angelina Jolie to be the ""Ultimate Superhero.""Was Laura Croft (as portrayed here) the ""ultimate superhero?"" I'd have to say, ""Yes!""The sets were all exquisite in design and architecture. The props were top of the line, state of the art Hollywood eye candy. The wardrobe, specifically that of Ms. Jolie, was quite well done, and while the character development did come late in the movie, I honestly found myself emotionally invested in her character.Frankly, I geuninely hope they make another ""Croft"" movie. I was so amused and entertained by the first one, I can't wait to see where she goes next.The elaborate sets and props were nearly awe-inspiring, delicately and cohesively tying the story together with the setting, and working to Jolie's advantage through demonstration of her talents and obvious hard work in preparation for this movie.If they DO make another, and I understand they already have at the time of this writing, I do hope they at least paid a good screen writer and kept the props manager from the last movie. As I have said so many times before, the little details add so much to a production; not just with this one, but any production, and they can often bridge the gap between avid fan and casual movie-goer enjoyment.All that having been said, the action is quite stimulating, and extremely well choreographed and executed by Jolie, thanks no doubt to her personal trainer Eddie Chow. The soundtrack was very ""now,"" with great songs as the background by Nine Inch Nails, Chemical Brothers, Groove Armada, Oxide & Neutrino, Delerium, Basement Jaxx, and more.Great music with the action and extremely creative set designs lend for a very enjoyable movie.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The film is just a copy of those Indiana Jones films, which were, in turn, copy of Belmondo's ""That Man from Rio"" (1964), ""The Corrupt Ones"" (1967) with Robert Stack, ""Secret of the Incas ""(1954) with Charlton Heston.

54,strong-122-478885,You Can No Longer Separate The Men From The Women,2,19 August 2014,"Perhaps I'm just too old-fashioned in my outlook on women's roles in movies these days, but, with that said, why does it seem to me that, time & again, Angelina Jolie is forever trying to firmly establish herself as being ""just-one-of-the-boys"" in her movies? Why does Angelina always seem to be out to prove that, yes, her balls are, indeed, much bigger and hang so much lower than any of the males in the cast? In this tailor-made vehicle (where Jolie is the only female actor), not only is her character a literal walking arsenal of state-of-the-art firearms (who always sleeps with a knife under her pillow, no less), but she has the superhuman capabilities to dodge bullets from the machine-gun fire of 5 masked assassins, as well as the ability to defeat and out-run anyone and anything.Lara Croft isn't a video-game character here. No. She's a real-life, flesh & blood woman, for crying out loud!Even though ""butch"" is the word that I'd readily use to best describe Jolie's Lara Croft character (and the word ""lesbian"" also comes to mind, as well), this, of course, doesn't prevent this liberated woman from wearing form-fitting tops specifically designed to push out her breasts right into the viewer's face.Considering that in real-life Angelina and her father, actor, Jon Voight, are at extreme odds with each other, I thought it really sucked that here in ""Tomb Raider"" these 2 were playing a loving, gushing father & daughter team where even death couldn't separate them or diminish that endless, overpowering love. (Sheesh! Give me a break, already!) When it comes to Angelina's overall looks, personally, I don't think she's all that attractive or beautiful. And those ridiculously puffy lips of hers (which remind me of a gorged vagina) are unmistakably the overdone product of massive collagen injections.Anyways - When it comes to this film's far-fetched, $115 million story (for which Angelina was paid $7 million), I found it absolutely impossible to believe that, all around this world, there are massive, buried-treasure sites which have all remained big, dark secrets until Lara Croft and her cronies (and enemies) have finally uncovered them.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I think I liked it because Angelina Jolie was believable as Lara Croft, and director Simon West put in enough fills into the story to really make this game character come to life.Cinematography was easy par with any James Bond movies, and locations and special effects were beautiful. Acting was good too. There was no camp about the way they told the story, and they were careful not to get too serious either.I only wish that they kept in the deleted scenes, and made this a 2 hr. movie.

56,dee.reid,I guess it's decent; one of the better video game adaptations,6,1 March 2006,"""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" stars Angelina Jolie as the ultra-sexy heroine of the title, itself an adaptation of the highly popular video game character. Though I never played the ""Tomb Raider"" games hardcore like several others, the film goes through a murky, confusing plot that may require a heavier dosage of suspension-of-disbelief pills and rides the Indiana Jones route for action scenes, but is still entertaining from start to finish.I won't argue that Lara Croft is probably the sexiest video game vixen of all time and that Jolie honestly loves her role as the character with joyful glee, giving guys what they want obviously and doing a lot of her own a**-kicking stunts. I can just imagine the fanboys drooling in the theaters over the many shots of her running in slow motion as the camera settles in on her bouncing chest and other parts of her curvaceous figure.As the buxom babe Lara Croft, Jolie works, despite being an odd choice and working with one of the best (faked) British accents I've heard from a mainstream Hollywood actress. And the film, directed by Simon ""Con Air"" West, gives her many a chance to show off her stuff. Lara breathes hard, she sweats hard, and she plays hard - all in a day's work.Here, the plot gets underway as a rare planetary alignment is beginning to take shape. It's a rare terrestrial phenomenon only occurring every 5,000 years, we're told, and time is rapidly winding down. Croft (Jolie), living on a lavish British estate and working from the clues her late father Lord Richard (Jolie's real-life pop played by Jon Voight) left her, uncovers an ancient artifact that could give its possessor the ability to control time. Richard was hard at work at locating the Triangle of Light, the artifact, which was split into two equal pieces and separated to keep any tomb raiders from finding and manipulating human history.Lara jumps into the action, along with egghead techie Bryce (Noah Taylor), to retrieve the two separate halves, on a globe-trotting odyssey (a la Indiana Jones) which takes her from the hot jungles of Cambodia to the freezing Siberian wastelands. But she is not alone, as the criminal order the Illuminati, its most sinister henchman Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), and Lara's American rival Alex West (soon-to-be James Bond Daniel Craig) also seeks the path to the Triangle.The plot has been the biggest problem for a lot of people but that can be dismissed; ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is based on a video game - how could it get any deeper? I'll go out on a limb and say this film is definitely one of the few video game adaptations I think people can sit through without cringing too much. But I'll give the film its just dues since according to the Washington Post, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is the highest grossing adaptation to date.Jolie is charming, especially in her action scenes, and I won't deny that early scene of her in the shower isn't pleasing to the eyes. I can recall two guys from high school I talked to who just adored Jolie as Lara Croft. Her scenes have her squinting menacingly, flashing those soft, oh-so-lovely lips and shooting up bad guys, with her vibrant sexuality virtually igniting the camera into flames. During these moments, we're treated to many charms of the supernatural, including a giant six-armed Brahma statue (a Hindu god), a legion of undead mummies, and the opening sequence of Lara being assaulted by a giant robot.It all works to a point, I guess. There are some plot contrivances, including a rather touching scene of a reunion between father and daughter, and a having to turn back time scenario in order to save a life. But like I stated earlier, it can be dismissed as Hollywood special effects and bull-jive, and it's definitely one of the better video game adaptations.If you could sit through both ""Resident Evil"" flicks, ""Doom"" (2005) and the first ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), then you should be right at home with ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider."" Again, Hollywood proves that women can kick some serious a** when required, and too bad hardcore fans were not treated to more bare flesh belonging to one Ms. Jolie.6/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Angelina Jolie is lovely and I'm sure she had fun making it, but I ran out of energy trying to believe in it. It reminded me of the worst bits from a bad Bond movie with offcuts from Charlie's Angels and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. In a nutshell, Lara gets landed with a key to a magic thingie that gets her half a triangle towards the ultimate whatyamacallit and fights off some men in suits and machine guns who also want to get hold the same thing.

To date (and excluding the soon to be released Tomb Raider reboot), the live action video game movie adaptation w/the highest Rotten Tomatoes score is 2010's Prince Of Persia w/%36. That's the bar. In short, Hollywood's attempts to bring your favorite video games to life have often been less than successful, w/only the Resident Evil franchise ever finding any sustained success w/a whopping six entries. Released in 2001 and w/a strong whiff of 90s b.o. clinging to its tight, sweat-soaked tank top, Tomb Raider was a modest hit and spawned a sequel, but w/a %20 RT score and a 5.8 rating on IMDb, it's not exactly considered a classic. That it's one of the more well regarded video game adaptations may say more about the genre than the movie itself. That said, it's always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for me (My two decade long crush on Ms. Jolie may play a small part in that). It has a couple of dizzyingly kinetic action scenes and a lean, tight pace that both help you to forget what absolute drivel the story is. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft isn't a character of any perceptible depth w/her too cool for the room attitude keeping you at arm's length even during the film's laughable attempts at drama, but the actress gamely attacks the material (such as it is). Her Lara doesn't do anything half way, even savagely assaulting the act of taking a shower. I really can't imagine any of this working half as well w/any other actress. A few not-then-but-now familiar faces pop up in Daniel Craig (Bond. James Bond) and Iain Glen (Game of Thrones). The former fails to make much of an impression aside from his extremely dodgy and comically bad American accent, and the latter is your typical generic Euro-villain w/an ill defined plan to blah blah blah. My memory of the sequel is that it's pretty dreadful, and the trailers for the reboot look equally so. I guess for me that makes Lara Croft: Tomb Raider the franchise's gold standard.

Thus, a movie that will most likely benefit a long line of video games-turned movies genre piece will forever be called a dud.

As a rare planetary alignment approaches she finds a strange clock hidden in her mansion, and begins a dangerous quest for a legendary artifact, the Triangle of Light, which may have the ability to control time itself ...This fantastic action film, with a wonderful heroic-sexy-funny performance from Jolie, is in my view the best movie adaptation of a video game (with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within a close second). It does this by taking all the best visual elements from the Eidos series of videogames (jungles, gun-battles, ancient curses, Lara's iconic outfit) and then concentrating totally on being a movie; letting the actors perform, having fun with the story and not slavishly adhering to the style of the games. It's a comic book film but its heart is in the right place, full of action and humour, with very little violence or profanity. Jolie is simply sensational in the lead, her eyebrows permanently raised in an infectious smirk of pleasure as she dances around the rest of the male cast, with notable turns by a young Craig (""And now for a cold shower !"") and the always reliable Voight (Jolie's real-life father). She is amazingly physical in the role, one of those rare films where a leading actress really looks like she's doing lots of dangerous stunts, typified by the wild ""bungee ballet"" dance/fight sequence, but the whole movie is full of great scenes. The Cambodian temple mid-section, complete with stone monkey brawl, is one of the most exciting and visually arresting blockbuster scenes in modern cinema. West skilfully mixes huge sturm und drang moments like these with funny vignettes (the moment where Lara overcooks a TV dinner), which is key in to keeping a big action film grounded and involving. There is one serious liability for me though, which is the music - there's a good score by Graeme Revell, but far too many song cues by techno-pop acts like Moby, Missy Elliott and Basement Jaxx, which date it badly (although there is a nice theme song, Elevation, by U2). Great action movies should have classic, timeless scores (see The Great Escape or Raiders Of The Lost Ark) whilst the music here is too often a distraction. It doesn't detract however from what is fundamentally a great family friendly romp of a flick, with a truly wonderful female icon saving the world.

61,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,British Female Indiana Jones?,9,5 January 2012,"Ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) entered cinema history, there have been film after film of directors trying to replicate the same formula. Most of them have failed but there are a couple gems that stand out from the rest. As for this film, it comes off as an Indiana Jones movie but with the lead being female, with a British accent and is one of the most attractive actresses in Hollywood. Besides it being a financially successful PC game, this film was a financial success and even spawned a sequel in 2003. Starring as Lara Croft is Angelina Jolie. She really brings sexy back in this action film because of how she moves. The way she leaps, rolls, jumps are all very exhilarating to watch. Mostly these moves look so great because of her agility and flexibility as a woman. Also starring with her is British actor Daniel Craig. It's funny to see Jolie who's American, play a British character while Craig who's British, plays an American character. In my opinion, that's pretty impressive because if I were acting out that scene, I would get confused with who I was talking to and speak whatever accent felt more comfortable; but they do it like they were born in those countries. What makes this movie like Indiana Jones is not because of the title, Tomb Raider. No, it's the substance involved in this film. Right at the beginning of the film, Croft is already fighting off a menacing killer robot that's packing some serious arsenal. Same thing with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981); no robots but still trying to avoid all kinds of dangerous devices such as impaling walls and rolling boulders. Lara Croft is just more modernized since Indiana Jones lived in the 1930s. Either way both are trying to find sacred artifacts that could change the fate of mankind. And to do this, they must hunt for these objects by entering ancient architecture. All this does is add spectacle and wonder to the film and it works really well no matter if it's 1981 or 2001.Making things even spicier in this film is what Croft wears. Whatever she wears in a certain scene is appropriate and sexy at the same time. It's almost like she's setting a standard for a next generation of archaeologists. As for the musical score, I didn't really care for it. I couldn't really feel anything from it and felt that maybe a different composer could have been hired for the job. That and the fact that although this movie was good, I just never felt any love for it. It was entertaining but it wasn't like much of the characters were memorable besides Lara Croft. That part disappointed me. As for the rest of the film, I really liked it and feel it's worth watching for good entertainment.Even though this movie doesn't have many characters to connect with, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is a fun action adventure film. Jolie plays Croft really well and it was wise of director Simon West to keep her as the main lead, otherwise, this movie might have flunked.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Then came Wing Commander, and all hope was lost. In 2001, two major brands which would soon go under the Square Enix banner dominated the summer box office with different results. One, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, wasn't based on a video game and was an original story with amazing CGI yet it failed at the box office and forced Square to exit the movie business for awhile. The other, a movie based on a best selling video game franchise starring a rising Angelina Jolie that would go on to be the most profitable video game movie of its decade, earning more than its sequel, the Cradle of Life, and would rekindle interest in the games, forcing a reboot of the same name to critical acclaim and an upcoming new version of said story coming out in march of next year. That movie, of course, is Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. This movie has it all, guns, boobs, action, humor reminiscent of indiana jones, and a killer soundtrack. I first saw it in the theaters having not beaten any of those games and was amazed by how well done they did this movie even though there have been failed attempts to bring classic video game movies to life (i'm looking at you warcraft!!!).",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
63,Rob_Taylor,Not as bad as I feared...,7,10 June 2003,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Sure it's stupid and designed to please the fan-base etc. but I really thought I was going to hate it, mainly because I absolutely loathe Angelina Jolie. She's a very, very weird person, it seems to me. Despite the slight setback of having the lead played by someone I can't really stand, I found myself growing to like the character. Jolie is, I have to say, probably the perfect choice for the part. Of course, when I realised her dad was playing the part of her dad I winced and scowled. I can't stand him either - maybe it's a family thing?. Even so, the movie grew on me and I found myself liking the film.I should point out that Chris Barrie (Rimmer from Red Dwarf) played a large part in my turn around. It's a shame he had a relatively small part in this, but nice to see him doing something other than Red Dwarf.The plot is no sillier than that of any other similar Indie Jones movie and the cast get on with it quite well.Surprisingly better than I thought.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
64,philip_vanderveken,"A decent, fast-paced and action-filled adventure movie",7,23 February 2005,"Perhaps I'm only one of the few, but I really can't say that I hated this movie. The main reason why I liked it was because it offered me exactly what I expected from it. It was plenty of action and it had a good looking Angelina Jolie in it. I know it isn't much, but I can guarantee you that it is the only way to avoid disillusion and because I can't immediately think of any other reasons to watch this movie. You don't have to watch it because of the world shocking story. I'm not saying the story isn't any good, but it was derived from a video game, which is, let's be honest, not really the best of modern literature.Lara Croft is a wealthy, British antiquities hunter, who travels to exotic places, in search of treasures and artifacts in ancient tombs and ruins. She is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, in handling weapons and she speaks several foreign languages. The Illuminati, a secret society, is seeking an ancient talisman that gives its possessor the ability to control time when the planets of the solar system are going into planetary alignment (something that only occurs every 5,000 years). To find the talisman, they need a key that is hidden in a clock, which is in Lara's possession. The Illuminati steal the key and now she must try to get it back before the alignment. You probably ask yourself why? Well, because in the meantime she has received a letter from her deceased father, telling her about the Illuminati's hidden agenda.If you don't expect much more but a fast-paced and action-filled adventure movie (you could compare it to the ""Indiana Jones"" movies), than this is exactly the movie to watch. OK, it may not be the most intellectual experience of your life, but it offers good fun and some decent acting. And that is also worth something. I give it a 7/10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Unlike most people, I didn't think Angelina did well in Girl Interrupted. Good movie but not for her.  But in this movie she pushes the limit.  And lets the female movement sore.  It's like a little of a female Bond and Mrs. Indiana Jones.  I found it more entertaining than the game.  I never really liked playing the video game anyway.  The controls are a little cocky.It's rather thin on plot, so some people might hate it for that, but I found it just totally fun to watch.  Must see for fans of the female hero.

68,baumer,I wish it was 1981 all over again,2,26 June 2001,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a lost art.  It is a film that embodies all the simplicity of film yet it was made ( at the time ) with all the latest technology.  It had a few excellent special effects in it and the stunts were the zenith of film making.  It was the absolute pinnacle of action films in 1981 and it still is today.  Funny, strange, ironic, take your pick that technology has changed exponentially in the last twenty years and yet we still cannot duplicate or successfully imitate a film that changed the scope of film twenty years ago.  As a film reviewer once said, just because you can put something in film, doesn't mean you should.  There has to be reason for it.  There has to be flow to it and most of all, if you are going to make an action film, the action has to be the treat.  The story has to be the glue that holds it all together.  Could you imagine if Lucas and Phillip Kaufman and William Huyck and Jeffrey Boam had the story of the eye of the pyramid and all that was Lara Croft?  Could you imagine the film that they could write?  As a matter of fact, wouldn't it be interesting if this was the next installment of the Indiana Jones legacy?  It would be quite interesting.  I know it is not fair to compare Lara Croft to Indiana Jones or Simon West to Spielberg but in some ways it is inevitable.  Indiana Jones paved the way for future films of the same nature to get made, now it is only fair that these same films be judged on their work.  It is no secret that Tomb Raider is a pastiche of other great films from the past like Indy and even Jackie Chan films.  But when you are imitating one's style, the least you can do is pay homage to it, not just punch the clock and hope that it turns out okay.  If you looked up prosaic in the encyclopedia of action films, this one would lead the list.The big problem with Tomb Raider is that it is all visual effects and no story.  There is to much ""action"" and not enough leading up to that action. Not that action is a bad thing, it isn't.  But when I don't really know anything about the bad guys, or even about Lara's cronies, then I can't really care about them or the rest of the movie.  Look at Belloq from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Look how much we knew about him before we discovered he was competing for the search of the Ark.  We knew he was a worthy but devious competitor to Indy.  We knew that he was smart and well versed in world religion and that he spoke Hovitos.  And how do we know this?  Aside from the fact that he is waiting to claim the idol at the beginning, we know it because of one exchange between him and Indy.""Again we can see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.  And you thought I'd given up.""""Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do Belloq.""""Yes, you could warn them.  If only you spoke Hovitos.""Such a simple exchange.  Yet such a vital one.  This makes their struggle all the more epic and all the more apodictic.  Lara Croft doesn't have a modicum of this.  Lara Croft doesn't know the fundamentals of what an action film embodies.  It may look and feel like a video game, but it smells and tastes like garbage.  I get angry when films like this tease me.  For every ground breaking film like T2 and The Matrix that thrill us and entertain us, you get a plethora of other films like The Mummy 2 and Tomb Raider that just go through the motions.  And these films will continue to flourish as long as they have 40 million dollar openings.  Because this encourages film makers.  It doesn't matter if these films cost 100 million to produce, they are going to make that back in the first month of distribution and then make more garbage.  I yearn for the days when films could justify their 20 million dollar budgets by making 300 or 400 million dollars world wide.  Now you get films like Tomb Raider, like Final Destiny, like A.E that are inflating their budgets and all they are doing is making films that have been done before, but they are making a very poor imitation of them.  If you look at a film like Star Wars, E.T. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbuster, Jaws, Back to the Future and even something like Close Encounters or Rambo, you will see that not only did these films make tons of money, they did it with a parsimonious budget compared to today's films.  Sure Tomb Raider and The Mummy and even something like Pearl Harbor will make lots of money, but at what ratio from budget to profit?  Raiders made about 20 times it's budget, Jaws, about 50 times it's budget, Star Wars, maybe 100 times it's budget. These films will be lucky to make one and a half times their budget, if these films perform well over seas ( Titanic being the exception ).  You think Scary movie and The Fast and The Furious are glitches?  They aren't, they are actually the model that films should be based on.  Less is sometimes more.Tomb Raider is a boring action film.  Angelina Jolie is quite good in the title role but that is about it.  All the action sequences, all the kicks and punches and exploding rock monsters are all done in vain because this is a film that you could actually fall asleep in.  Next time, I suggest they follow the manual a little more carefully when trying to make the next great action film.  Spielberg and Lucas are the icons of the business for a reason.  Simon West and company shouldn't forget that.  After all, you want to be compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark and not Cutthroat Island.2 out of 10- Prosaic being the mots du jour.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Unrealistic, extreme, complicated, negative, and too subjective. The reason that it deserves at least a bit of good rating (stars) is good look of a girl, especially because she looks like game character, especially that face which is game like, and that it deals with something serious, important, powerful like time travel and God. But the way it is shown all is not that good, because too fast, random, too much quantity, and lacks quality. I prefer slower but higher quality and more realistic movies. Only good for video game lovers and stunt lovers, and only as inspiration. The best part are few stunts, music, and effects like time slowdown.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
71,blott2319-1,"I mean, for a video game movie, it's not terrible",6,9 September 2020,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider delivers exactly what you'd expect from a film adaptation of a video game that is modeled after Indiana Jones. I did appreciate that we were spared the extensive origin story of Lara, because the film is loaded with enough reminiscing in the past that we don't need all the details of how she became this strange mix of archaeologist and adventurer. I am a bit curious what exactly she expects her job to entail, considering the kind of violent training she goes through, but for the convenience of the movie, she ends up training the exact skills necessary to survive these missions. My other problem with the character of Lara Croft is that she is so unrelatable. One of the charms of Indiana Jones is that he has a somewhat vulnerable ""every man"" quality to him, but Lara is beautiful, exorbitantly rich, cold, calculating, and without flaws. I was still able to root for her, because she is shown to be a nice person, and has altruistic motivations, but I can't imagine people putting themselves in her shoes.That being said, the action and adventure in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider are entertaining. The CGI of the things she fights is not great, but when she takes on other people, it makes for an exciting sequence. I was also intrigued to see how they might utilize a time-travel device in the climax (although the reality of what they do with it was a bit of a let-down.) This is a style of movie that I can get behind, and even though it's quite over-the-top and silly at times, I appreciate that they had a video game property with a semblance of story to it. In many ways it feels like this is a superhero movie because Lara is indestructible, and the villains are practically twirling mustaches and tying damsels to railroad tracks. I will say that the movie was a bit hindered by the PG-13 rating. Similar to the Ninja Turtles or GI Joe, it feels silly when you have a character who is well-known for wielding lethal weapons, and then you can't have them use those weapons because you don't want to create a bloody mess. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is still a watchable film, but not one I'll need to watch more than once.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

However, I was a little bored.  I guess the whole kooky sci-fi plot didn't have much appeal to me.  Or maybe I'm just not a huge fan of this sub-genre of sci-fi (adapting comic books and video games into feature-length motion pictures).  There are exceptions, but normally films like this don't grasp my attention.  I thought some of the action scenes were quite fun (Angelina just looks so cool whipping out her guns at the villains) and the running time was only about an hour and forty minutes.  So I didn't experience the long, slow torture like I did with ""The Mummy Returns.""  More movies should keep it snappy.  For those who are anticipating the big special f/x extravaganzas...I'm pretty sure you won't be let down.  And I have to say, this is a lot better than that bomb ""Pearl Harbor.""  If you're like me, and don't get easily blown away by vibrant f/x, you might want to go out for popcorn.

You must be an aristocrat to be an adventurer by definition; otherwise, how would you finance all those exotic escapades and cool clothes? Jolie performs all of her own stunts in this special effects-laden adventure that is long on action and exotic locales and short on character development and substance. It contains most elements of a fun, action movie: it's fast paced. full of action, special effects, and form-fitting outfits. The plot concerns the recovery of some time altering artifact from an ancient tomb of sorts. Like most Bond films, the plot doesn't matter much, as our eyes are fixed on Jolie and everything she says and does. Remember, the character is based upon a video game, so she'll be able to do all sorts of things that real heroes wouldn't be able to do.

75,jhclues,Calling Tim Burton...Calling Tim Burton...,7,20 June 2001,"She's got the attitude, she's got the moves, she's got the--well, she's got the look; Angelina Jolie is Lara Croft, in `Tomb Raider,' the action film adapted from the popular video game, directed by Simon West.  Like Indiana Jones and James Bond, Lara Croft is larger than life, and she had to be to bring this film to life.  After a slam-bang opening, we find Lady Croft at home in England, where the game is about to begin.  Still lamenting the loss some years earlier of her father, archeologist Lord Croft (Jon Voight), Lara comes across a certain object among his effects one day that had been hidden away in a secret place in their mansion.  Unsure of what it is, or of it's value, she seeks the counsel of a friend of her father's, and soon learns that whatever the piece is, it's somehow the key to an undertaking of dubious merit which has long been sought by a gentleman by the name of Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), who must have it in order to complete his quest. Lara, however, has no intention of parting with it, but Powell is a man of persuasive means and is determined to have it at any cost.  But his methods of bargaining do not sit well with Lara Croft, and they are soon at it head to head.  And it's only the beginning of an adventure that will ultimately take them to opposite ends of the earth and into some ancient and exotic tombs, as Lara strives to uncover the mystery behind this cryptic antiquity.	Jolie was the perfect choice to embody Lara Croft, from the confident swagger she affects, right on down to her articulate British accent and the riveting glare she uses to such great effect.  Her Lara is fearless and appealing, and director West allowed enough time in between the action for the character development that makes her more than just an action figure, and Jolie put the time to good use to flesh her out and create a well rounded character, and not just a one dimensional caricature; and the movie is all the better for it, as it provided the substance the film needed to make it fly.  Lara is actually a fairly complex character, in fact; possibly more than you would expect in a movie like this.  She's daring, yet vulnerable, but with a sleek exterior like tempered steel.  And watching her, you get the feeling that there's nothing she couldn't do, which gives her something of an invincible quality.  Even when she's immersed in the action and the excitement gets intense, there's no denying that she is absolutely the star of the show.  	This film has all the ingredients with which West should have been able to whip up a veritable banquet for the senses; but unfortunately, he came up a bit short-- as if he did everything right, but failed to add that extra pinch of spice that would've made it sumptuous and lip-smacking good.  What the film lacks is atmosphere and that special touch that someone like Tim Burton always brings to his films, like what he did with `Batman,' for example, which took you a step beyond what you were actually seeing on the screen.  West had a decent story, magnificent special effects and the kind of leading lady directors dream of having; but he brought it all to fruition with a bare modicum of imagination, presenting it with a kind of straightforward what-you-see-is-what-you-get style, which worked well enough for him with `Con Air,' but wasn't enough for this kind of film, which desperately needed some nuance to really sell it.  Not that this is a bad movie, by any means; it just lacks that spark of life that would've made it special.  In retrospect, West was probably not the best choice to put at the helm of this picture.	The supporting cast includes Daniel Craig (Alex), Leslie Phillips (Wilson), Mark Collie (Larson), Chris Barrie (Hilary) Julian Rhind-Tutt (Pimms) and Noah Taylor (Bryce).  Hopefully, there will be a sequel to this film; Jolie's Lara Croft is just too good a character to leave alone, and `Tomb Raider' is like an appetizer-- once you've sampled it you're going to want the full meal.  And Jolie is an actor who will deliver the goods if given the chance; she certainly did more than enough in this one to make it work, and her performance alone makes it worth seeing.  Now if they can only come up with a director who can measure up to her for the next one, and can deliver on the promise this film made but failed to fully realize.

Actually ""Tomb Raider"" is a brilliant display of ultra cool and style overcoming all resistance. This is an amazing feat. Afterall the movie has a very convoluted writing credit involving West and others based on the interactive game. Given further examination this gets interesting. ""Tomb Raider"", the game, was based on ""Indiana Jones"". So really Angelina Jolie is a version of Harrison Ford-- not bad for legacy. Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft sports the English accent and is the icon of Milennium ultra cool and style. She looks stunning, and is in great shape for the movie. The martial arts fighting she does is very impressive-- she did train. It is no joke that her breasts are on display in every shot. Lara Croft is always sporting a tight top whether she is in the jungle or icy wasteland. Once again, genius. The movie has a strong villain in Powell played with calculation and charisma by Iain Glen. Powell is slick malevolence and he says he is a lawyer-- go figure.

78,stamper,"Funny, Sexy, Cool",8,28 July 2001,"Tomb Raider is really a good movie. This films just got it all, action, comedy, emotions, adventure, exotic locations and a pretty leading lady. This film is, you might say a combination of Indiana Jones and James Bond only with a lot more fictional elements. I overall thought this was a good film which had some great moments and only one weak moment. (WARNING SPOILER AHEAD!!!) This would be the moment in the ending, when Lara (Angelina Jolie) kills the bad guy by going back in time, turning around a knife he thrown and thus letting him kill himself. (SPOILERS END!!!)
The direction was good, although sometimes I found the action hard to follow, but I did not expect less from a graduate of the Jerry Bruckheimer School of Actionmovie making'. Well Done.
All in all I feel that this movie could not have been as good without Angelina Jolie in the leading role. I mean, the British accent she learned for this movie, her appeal, her coolness, her sexyness, her toughness, her cleverness and her humor all make her a worthy Lara Croft. But not only that, they also make her a likeable person and I must say one which I would love to have as a girlfriend (no offense!). I hope to see a sequel, made by the same crew (and some of the cast), that is even better. For I hope the scriptwriter learns from his mistakes. I believe a better sequel is a possibility and a must with such a great character and such a great leading Lady'.

79,fernandoschiavi,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is full of exaggerations in the script, lacking rhythm makes the film unpalatable and not at all amusing",5,24 October 2020,"It was the beginning of the 2000s and the adaptation of video games for the cinema was not so common. Perhaps the best known example was the adaptations of ""Street Fighter"" in the 1990s, a decade in which Tomb Raider was created by Core Design in 1996. The game Tomb Raider, which has the archaeologist Lara Croft as its protagonist, quickly became a of the biggest icons in the industry, giving birth to other games, comics and movies. Ten years after its debut, the Guinness Book recognized the game's protagonist as the most successful female character in its media. It is no small feat for a character who was born as a more charming, morally more complex and controversial counterpoint, among some media, because of Indiana Jones' clothing and sex appeal for marketing purposes. A character coming from a cultural universe where treasure hunters dressed as archaeologists / explorers endowed with multiple skills were no longer a novelty in theaters deservedly won their space and fell in favor with the public.Archaeologist Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) needs to find Pandora's Box, famous for containing all the evils of the world inside. The object is hidden in a place known as Origin of Life, located on the African continent. But on his journey Croft will have to face dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds), a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who is also behind the object.With the success of the games, it wouldn't be long before Hollywood wanted to bring the character to the big screen. Along the way, the production had to calm the court of fern judges who created controversies for everything involving the contracted Angelina Jolie to live the role of Lara Croft: she didn't have the proper physique, she was an American playing an originally British character, she had tattoos and a few other things about the personal life of the actress that apparently made her incompatible for the role. Simon West (from Assassin at Fixed Price and The Expendables 2), director appointed to guide the film, came out in defense of the actress since the first media trumpets, which gradually dissipated.As in the games made by Eidos, the film goes through paradisiacal landscapes and there is no lack of shots, kicks and punches. Several people got their hands on the script that ends up being disappointing. The film adapts the first games of the franchise, which were quite successful on PlayStation 1. Lara's entire journey, from challenges to the places she needs to go, is very reminiscent of games, and even the greatest inspiration of the franchise: Indiana Jones. It is impossible not to play or watch a film in the franchise and not immediately remember the creation of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, but it is a pity that there is only this similarity.The film begins and ends with a fight sequence by Lara Croft in threatening training, with a robot built by his inventor-mechanic-person-of-technology Bryce (Noah Taylor, in a friendly but completely useless role from the middle to the end of the movie). And as we are talking about something that mixes science and mysticism, it is clear that there should be a natural time-setting point - always regressive - even at the climax of the main action. And here, this natural point is the alignment of the planets followed by a solar eclipse. It is around this event and the possibility of activating the Triangle of Light that the script advances without much criteria, apart from the highlight of curious beatings performances under a sound track partially disconnected from its environment, and not in a good way.The script, by the way, is basic and generic, the kind we have seen in several productions that were inspired or even plagiarized Indiana Jones, that is, we have a mystical artifact that can cause the destruction of the world and Lara Croft has to dive into an adventure to prevent a dangerous secret society from finding that object before it. A good part of the elements of the character are pushed in anyway, the organization's motivations, the emotional relationship with his father, all of this is shown in a bureaucratic way and without much involvement. There are still certain things that don't seem to match the general concept of the film (what are those robots?), But it is noticeable that the main focus was not on the story, but on showing Jolie parading through the film in shorts and tight clothes while shooting and fought against everything and everyone, clearly relying much more on referencing the game with an exaggerated dose of fan service that must have pleased a portion of the fans.
Basically, the film works on the fragile pursuit of a legendary object and the attempt to achieve power by controlling time. However, the plot never addresses this in a formal way, exploring the possibilities of this action. All the temporal perception that could take the text to another level is treated in a didactic and irritatingly shallow way, having only two moments where pairs of dialogues show how it could be different: the moment when Lara enters her own ""web of time"" and the moment when the fate of Alex West, Daniel Craig's character, is changed. Nor do we have a real character development, not even a greater dramatic exploration of Lara Croft herself, who stands out with praise in the action scenes - even with special effects and shameful visuals around her - but it does not go any further. It is laughable that every time he tries to give the heroine a different coloring, the script falls into the paternal issue, in his dilemma of saving his father and changing the weather; in your pain of loss never overcome. It seems that the writers wanted to take advantage of the fact that Angelina Jolie was, in fact, the daughter of Jon Voight, who plays Lord Richard Croft, and that is why she insisted on this area to get more feelings from the viewer.The important thing is that Angelina Jolie is there, almost all the time, filling the big screen, and the film practically comes down to her. Just like Lara Croft, she wears short shorts to show off her well-shaped thighs and a tight T-shirt for, ummmm, let's say she shows ""she has a chest"" to face the action. Breasts, by the way, that are not entirely true (the producers gave a boost with filled bras). Ah, but pay attention to the bathing scenes, which, by the way, are mill metrically calculated to ""entertain"" the audience with all the sensuality of Lara ... Despite holding the pistols without the firmness of who is shooting, she is very well in the scenes action and holds your attention with your green eyes and full lips. However, although Jolie is perfect for the role of Lara Croft, but even she cannot save the film from a meaningless storyline and action sequences with no emotional impact.The direction of photography brings a strong and funny sepia filter and lots of shadows, in addition to an excessive orange tone and scenes with low lighting, a standard style, but that even works for an action movie. Filled with practical effects and with a camera that explores the whole scenario, we can say that the sequences are well done and, in general, they can get excited. Another technical side with good quality is its art direction, which uses several standard costumes in relation to the theme of treasure hunters and secret societies, but all are very functional, the biggest highlight being the clothes worn by Lara Croft, which may not make much sense if we think about the environment, but are faithful to the games in the franchise. Despite a good setting and some cool scenes, the film is dragged, and has some very uninteresting little subplots. In the last act, the film manages to have a significant improvement, but the film cannot offer much more than that.In an interesting way, despite a disconnected text and a montage that practically does not hit a single dramatic passage from sequence A to sequence B (the worst of them all, the atrocious cut that goes from Lara being pulled by the Siberian dogs to a general plan in front of your house ... something horrendous, simply horrendous), the film manages to give individual spaces for each one to play a little on stage, which ends up amusing the viewer. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is one of those films to turn off the brain, laugh at the absurdities of the direction, at shameful phrases as a joke (""now I need a cold shower..."") and enjoy the batter of mythological airs coated with ""hunting treasure"". Lara Croft: Tomb Raider does not fail as an adaptation, after all it has a base close to the game franchise, however, in addition to not being able to properly present us the rich universe of the treasure hunter, it is still full of exaggerations in the script that do not fit in the proposed plot, lacking rhythm and with a weak protagonist who makes the film unpalatable and not at all amusing.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

81,MihaiSorinToma,A very bad representation of Tomb Raider,4,14 January 2018,"On the verge of a cosmic event which happens only once every five thousand years, the famous Lara Croft finds about an ancient artifact, split in half, which grants the one who puts it back together godly powers. As an evil organization seeks it for its own purpose, Lara must act quick in order to prevent a greater evil from being unleashed.It's a movie which takes a famous video-game character and puts it in the middle of an adventure, just like it would in one of the many games of the series. Unfortunately, this and choosing Angelina as Lara Croft are the only good aspects of the film. It's like the producers thought that it's enough to have a popular character, put it in a movie and just expect the outcome. The plot is bad, to say the least, linear, predictable and almost thrill-less, the characters are extremely simplistic and annoying, making you wonder many times what are they doing in the picture, while the special effects are plain awful. You can search for movies a couple of decades before this one which simply look awesome by comparison. It also has plenty of action but, due to the above mentioned facts and the extremely exaggerated implementation of it, it doesn't manage to generate thrill or suspense, a must in this type of movies.It feels rushed. It feels like it's made just to be made, like somebody came one day with an idea to use the name Tomb Raider without any type of effort, without a decent plot, without decent supporting characters or antagonists and even without decent special effects. It leaves you with the impression that it is just a rip-off of a very popular name, although the overall result isn't all that catastrophic. It's undoubtedly a bad movie, one which leaves you very disappointed, especially if you had some kind of hope or affection regarding Lara.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
82,russem31,Not bad at all,7,26 December 2005,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, can be considered yet another film based on a video game. However, like very few video games turned films, this one actually breaks the curse of being bad. And while the script is quite flat and predictable and the dialogue only average, what really makes this film stand out is great actress Angelina Jolie, who takes on the title role of Lara Croft and easily makes it her own. The fact that Angelina Jolie is every bit like her video game persona in real life only makes the transition to Lara that much easier. And it was nice to see her real life father Jon Voight portraying her screen character's father, Lord Richard Croft. A solid enough 7 out of 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
83,bellino-angelo2014,Probably the best movie ever based on a videogame,7,27 January 2020,"Movies based on videogames have a bad reputation. Mostly because people are always angry of seeing these kind of cinematographic adaptations since playing the games is much better than seeing the movies. And the Bottom 100 is full chock of videogame-based movies... with features such as HOUSE OF THE DEAD, MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION, FAR CRY, IN THE NAME OF THE KING and BLOODRAYNE (just for naming a few) so it looks like a genre dead on arrival. However, even in this genre there are very few exceptions. And LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER is the best example of this. Before I go on with the review I have to admit that my expectations before watching it were very low, but in the end I liked it much more than I expected.The movie (and videogame) is about the travels and adventures of Lara Croft, a gorgeous noblewoman who travels around the globe in search of the rarest artifacts, in an Indiana Jones style. In this movie she has to retrieve the two halves of an ancient artifact that controls time before it ends in the wrong hands. And, as you might expect, there are lots of chase scenes, lots of special effects and some nice shots at Angelina Jolie's gorgeous body.In substance, the movie is fun. There is some CGI who was new for 2001 moviegoers, the acting is good by everyone (including a then unknown Daniel Craig before his 007 days) and the movie is fast paced. And I think that this movie helped Angelina Jolie to be more and more a box-office star (especially for teens and young adults at the time).However, don't watch this movie with high expectations. Just expect a movie that has not to be taken too seriously and, if you are in the right mindset, you'll like it (even if you never played the games like me).I haven't seen the recent remake yet but I hope it's good like the original and much better than the sequel to this one (that I haven't seen yet because of its reputation).",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

86,perfectbond,Unsatisfying,6,26 February 2004,"Having never played any of the videogames but being familiar with the character through its cultural immersion, I was somewhat on target with what to expect. The results were quite unsatisfying. There were some good action scenes and special effects, especially the raid on Lara's place and the vivified statues at the Cambodian temple, but most of the time I felt the product on screen was quite pedestrian. As archaeology movies go Lara Croft in nowhere near in the same league as Indiana Jones though if Speilberg directed this maybe he could raise it above the simple cash cow that it is. But then Indy is infinitely more interesting than Lara. That's just my individual opinion. Still the movie is a good diversion and Lara though a bland character is given more life than she deserves by the quite competent Jolie. One last note: Jon Voigt, Jolie's real father, playing that role in the film was a nice casting touch. 6/10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Those sleek cheek bones accompanied with a few strands of hair in her face. Feminine enough to not scare the boys and strong enough to rile up the women. The poster is perfect. It is advertising at it's best. As for the movie, there is what could be called a plot, long on techno poisoned drivel and short on fun, but it's mostly copped from Raiders of the Lost Ark. But Angelina rides a giant stone pillar and smashes things with it.P.S. Daniel Craig gives, what could be considered, a great audition for the lead in an action series.

89,Movie-12,"If you don't expect more than pointless action, you will get your money's worth. *** (out of four)",7,4 July 2001,"LORA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	At last, here is a successful screen adaptation from a video game. ""Lora Croft: Tomb Raider"" takes the plot seriously, and has a lot of fun with it. Unlike the silly ""Wing Commander"" and incompetent ""Mortal Combat,"" this movie soars with its physical potential. The movie experienced many production complications, therefore I excepted it to symbolize the three tedious years of filmmaking, the director who bailed out, the sexual harassment charges filed, and the 11 screenwriters who couldn't satisfy Paramount Pictures, the bill, and Eidos Interactive, the company that owns the video game. ""Lora Croft: Tomb Raider"" manages to pull past its problematic filmmaking process and provide audiences with what is expected from this action packed extravaganza. 	Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie portrays Lora Croft, who is a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. The role of Croft was not an easy accomplishment, even for Jolie. She endured great physical hardships during the shooting, including injuries to her knee, foot, and shoulder. It's a good thing that Jolie did the film, however, she's probably the only actress with the capabilities and physical appearance to handle such a role. Elizabeth Hurley, Sandra Bullock, Denise Richards, Ashley Judd, and Jennifer Love Hewitt were also among the actresses considered for the role. Any of those fine performers would have brought their own charm and delight to the role, but Croft feels perfect for Jolie. 	The disposable premise is not just a clothesline for various action sequences. It stands alone as a needlessly complicated plot contraption concocted out of desperation and deadlines. I am glad the actors took it so seriously; this material begs for parody. Lora Croft discovers a key-based clock unidentifiable even by an antique dealer. Meanwhile, a ruthless member of a powerful society named Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) is waiting for a planetary alignment that occurs once every 5,000 years. This event will give the holder of two separated pieces of a magical stone the power over time itself. Croft and Powell learn that the key will unlock the whereabouts of those missing halves.	The rest of the plot follows the villains and heroes on their journey around the planet, searching for the various artifacts and precious instruments. The film will not disappoint action fans. Suspend disbelief and follow the film's absurd concepts, then the fast-paced action sequences, eye-popping special effects, and convincing sets will satisfy. The outcome of almost every single scene is as obvious as it is predictable, but that doesn't mean we enjoy the scenes any less. There are some exciting action sequences in ""Lora Croft: Tomb Raider,"" although it's easy to become lost in the action; the frequent cuts and camera tricks often interrupt the flow of the action.	""Lora Croft: Tomb Raider"" is a fun summer thrill ride. It's not a smart, savvy film, but compared to movies like ""The Mummy Returns"" it's a wake up call in the midst of a starving summer movie season. If you don't expect more than pointless action, you will get your money's worth.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Jolie is in great shape and does well, her acting ability shines through in what is a bit of a lame script.I don't play the game, but Tomb Raider is crying out for a trip to Egypt - to, er, raid a tomb.

When ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was finally released, not all of them were satisfied.  But the movie does have its good points.  Angelina Jolie takes the lead as Lara Croft, the famed archaeologist/adventurer, woman warrior and gamer's dream girl.  She plays the role as if she were meant to be Lara Croft.  The movie also boasts some very good visual effects and exciting action.  The plot does leave a bit to be desired, though.  The ancients may have had deep knowledge about the universe and the planets, but the concept with the planetary alignment was just barely plausible.  But, really, with movies like this, it's all about explosions and the star's body.  Lara Croft's game might not be for everybody, and the same goes for the movie.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
95,departed07,Not all video game movies are worthless; this was quite fun,7,14 April 2008,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is the latest movie from a video game franchise to hit the big screen where unlike many video game movies from Double Dragon and Street Fighter to fail moviegoers and fan expectations, I found this film to be quite kick-ass.Based on the popular Tomb Raider video games where Lara Croft is the female version of Indiana Jones going through many adventures finding artifacts and battling many enemies from prehistoric creatures to man, the strapping woman who has been a sex appeal to many video gamers around the world is being played by a sex appeal to many moviegoers where you don't have to care what's going on but have a good time. Angelina Jolie was the perfect choice though in high school my teacher thought that Catherine Zeta Jones fit the part better due to her Welsh accent, I beg to differ. Jolie, who is known to being rebellious, performed most of her own stunts while going through gun training at the same time where in this film she's off to find an important artifact that can make people go back in time. The plot could only matter to those who feel like paying attention, but in the end it's really the action sequences with Jolie and lots of visual effects that matter.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

With low expectations, I sat there and sat there and sat there, begging for their ridiculous plot to wrap up and finish already. There were some well staged fight sequences but that's it. Jolie (who did interesting work early on in her career - Gia, Wallace, etc.)obviously decided to underplay (so much so her performance borders on sleepwalking). But there was NOTHING to the story, it just moved from scene to scene with some lame forced Hollywood quip crowbarred in at the last minute. I detested how much GUNS played in the movie - here some stone figures deep in a hidden temple come to life to just be blasted away by a gun. How clever. You could tell some of the special effects people had been influenced by the great Ray Harryhausen (Jason and The Argonauts) when they tried to bring the giant Gold Buddha to life, but the computer animation made it all look so flat thus so unthreatening.

98,Al_The_Strange,Tomb Raider Review,7,25 April 2014,"Since its initial release in 1996, Tomb Raider is one of the most prominent video game franchises. It did to games what Indiana Jones did to movies and what Clive Cussler did to books: they all tap into a certain sense of adventure, with ties in archeology and ancient history, and with liberal amounts of action and peril, to immerse the audience in a thrilling experience. Lara Croft may be well-known for her...ahem...bodily proportions...but she is an action heroine who could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Indy and Dirk Pitt, in terms of physique, confidence, knowledge, and wit.Inevitably, the live-action film for Tomb Raider was released in 2001, with enough hype to build it up as one of the biggest action hits of the year. The film definitely tries its hardest to be cool and hip; right from the start, it's loaded with unusual camera tricks and movements, with lots of frivolous time-lapse shots and fast cuts. A high-tempo soundtrack accentuates the small wealth of shoot-outs, chases, fights, and athletic stunts. The film does entertain, and there are moments where the action does come off as being ""cool"" and still holds up. A lot of it is pretty senseless and frivolous, and there is an underlying impression that the film is merely emulating a game experience, boss fights and all. Regardless, the film is successful at being stylish and fun.On the other hand, the style becomes so heavy-handed that it does bring down the experience a notch. Frequent flashbacks and other random scenes disrupt the flow of the film. Some scenes, especially toward the end, become so surreal and weird, they further disrupt what should otherwise be a straightforward adventure flick.With these random scenes, however, the film does try its best to dig up some solid substance. The story is not bad, per se, and it does its best to add some backstory and relevance to the characters and plot. I'm certain the filmmakers (and some audiences too) geeked out when they saw John Voight playing Lara Croft's father. The actual plot line, however, is pretty screwy, and follows the exact same structure as a video game (cut-scene, enter new area, fight bad guys, fight boss, obtain artifact, continue to next zone). Lara Croft is a two-dimensional character at best, for even with a backstory, there's never really enough to flesh her out and illicit much empathy for her or her struggles.As mentioned above, the film has style, for better or for worse. Acting is a strange animal to judge here; Angelina Jolie is easily the centerpiece of the show, and she fits the part physically. She also does inject her character with a certain playfulness and wit that suits the character. Now that the games have evolved in so many different ways, however, I can't help but to regard Jolie's performance as an antiquated one-dimensional portrayal of Lara, same as it was in the 90s, lacking in nuanced depth or emotion. Emulating the classic Lara Croft, Jolie does a good job, but in the future, I'm certain that she'll be supplanted very easily (especially if the 2013 game is any indication). As far as everybody else goes, they're serviceable at best. Except for a few witty lines, the writing is pretty bad. This production has decent sets, props, and costumes, but also some rather aged and bad special effects. Music tries its best to seem cool; the soundtrack is a favorite of mine, but it can serve as a distraction during the actual movie. The score is alright.With all the style and action, and with the promise of seeing the classic video game character brought to life, the Tomb Raider movie seemed like a big movie event of my generation. It did its part well enough, but it remains a rather shallow and uneven experience. It would be worth a look for fans and anybody interested in adventure flicks.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Bullets that do no damage (and rarely hit their target), ridiculous made-up artifacts with special powers, a guy with a fedora (really, there's a guy with a fedora), a woman that lives in a temple and has no real job and limitless money, etc, etc...Angelina Jolie is beautiful, sexy, pouty, she wears sexy outfits with a padded bra (yeah, they really put her in a padded bra), she performs acrobatic stunts, she has a shower scene (with no nudity), and she stars in this really bad movie, so none of those positive things matter.This movie does everyting wrong, all the way down to billing Jon Voight as a lead actor when he isn't even in the first hour.

100,chrisbrown6453,Aww Man....,7,5 July 2001,"""Tomb Raider"" is one of those movies that I have been covering ever since the website opened in 1997. Paramount has gone through years and years of preparation trying to get everything right for this movie. Originally slated to have been ready and released in 1999, everyone from Demi Moore, to Sandra Bullock, to Anna Nicole Smith were rumored to don the green shirt and high boots. When Angelina Jolie, GOD bless her, agreed to the role, it was finally evident that this movie based on the popular video game was going to be made. And since then, I continued to follow every development regarding the picture. So obviously, like every other ""Tomb Raider"" fan, I wanted this movie to be good. I ignored what I read in the newspapers this morning and instead, crossed my fingers, much like I did with ""Pearl Harbor."" Instead, ""Tomb Raider"" turns out to be a one-dimensional, witless mush of explosions, boring chases, and Fatboy Slim mixes. The film may satisfy the die-hard fans of the video games but for those of you seeking a summer blockbuster action film, head for the much anticipated Jurassic Park III. There is really no substance to the movie. What's on the surface, the trailers, the promos, is what you get. ""Tomb Raider"" begins by showing us Lady Lara Croft, photographer by reputation, archaeologist by night. On May 15th, during the alignment of the planets (which only occurs every 5,000 years), she is awakened in her mansion by the noise of a clock ticking. Lara learns that the clock is the key to unlock the power of total time control. Unfortunately, this movie has no character dimension. Why? Cause you need a script, which is something else this movie is lacking. Many are comparing the film with ""The Mummy Returns,"" but at least that movie had the occasional joke and punch line. Crack a smile in ""Tomb Raider?"" It'll probably only be during Angelina Jolie's unnecessary, but happily appreciated, half-nude bedroom scene. Angelina Jolie is in every single scene, yet amazingly, we only learn three things about her: She loves archaeology, she loves adventure, and she misses her daddy. Don't get me wrong: Angelina Jolie is hot. But Lara Croft is not. A couple of years ago, the promos for ""Tomb Raider"" all read ""Who is Lara Croft?"" That's an answer I'd still like to know.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
101,bat-5,"Fun, but something was lacking.",6,24 June 2001,"Based on the very popular video game, Tomb Raider plays out exactly like one of Lara Croft's digital adventures.  True there is more to the movie than Lara running around the world with pistols ablazin', but there seemed to be something lacking.  Angelina Jolie was the perfect choice for the flesh and blood Lara Croft though.   With her dual pistols, tight clothes and long braid of hair, Jolie is ready for whatever is thrown at her.  The plot deals with an ancient clock that has begun counting down on the first day of planetary alignment.  The clock is the key to finding two pieces of the Triangle of Light.  Once whole again, it will give its possesor the ability to move through time.  So, it is up to Lara Croft to save the world, and the universe from ultimate doom.   The effects and stunt work are first rate.  I did enjoy the sequence where Lara is jumping around her mansion and has to fend off a horde of armed men storming her home.  Probably the best visual effect, or at least my favorite, is in the Cambodian temple. A statue comes to life and naturally, goes after anyone within sight.  Overall, Tomb Raider isn't a bad film.  It does offer some thrills and Angelina Jolie is probably the best thing about the movie.  What I felt was lacking was the sense of fun that was very prevalent in the Indiana Jones films.  Those still hold up to multiple viewings, but I think one may become as bored as Lara does after watching this one more than twice.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

105,Magow-Intermean,Lara Croft: Tomb Raider Review,9,25 March 2019,"Intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft discovers a mythical clock, bequeathed to her by her father, which, when reunited with the broken and scattered pieces of a magical artefact, has the power to control time. Croft ventures to Cambodia with guns blazing.
Jolie was born to play Croft, as surely as Bob Hoskins' destiny was pixellated plumber Mario Mario. And Jolie doesn't just look the part - although months of training have given her a whipcord physique and she sports perhaps the most strikingly engineered bosom since Jane Russell - she acquits herself well in the furious fight scenes and frantic, action set-pieces.Unfortunately, kick-ass brawling skills and hooters like a dead heat in a Zeppelin race do not a good movie make. Even when the MacGuffin is discovered, it takes a while to get into gear. And with a leather-clad Jolie roaring around London on a motorbike, stopping off at vividly imagined auction rooms and raffishly bedecked law offices, the impression is that we're in for The Avengers all over again. It's not that bad, of course.Back at the ranch, Lara is surprised by a cadre of baddies. What follows - a blazing gun battle with the protagonists pinging around the vast chamber - is as good a piece of action cinema as you'll see this summer. But the film plateaus out and the eye candy soon becomes predictable.Exotic locations - Cambodia, Venice, Iceland - are present and correct, and there's a half-hearted stab at romance between Jolie and Daniel Craig's rival adventurer, who may be a bad guy (and, then again, may not), and who may have a history with Lara (and, then again, may not).Conspicuous by its absence is a narrative spark bright enough to engross you. Neither, save Lara, is there anyone to give a damn about. It's glaringly obvious from the outset that insipid villain Glen is no match for Lara, and this skews the adversarial dynamic and renders the traditional cheering and booing - surely a staple of the genre - rather redundant.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Yup indeed, regarding the budget and the hype ""Tomb raider"" might be one of the worst movies ever and just like any other movie that is based on a videogame it fails completely. Angelina Jolie might be a pretty figure but she can't act and looks completely stupid compared with other filmheroes (and excuse me, you have to compare it with Indiana Jones as the director Simon West wasn't ashamed to steal some jokes from that trilogy so...). There is no need to tell the story, Lara is an archeologist and she must find some mystical piece, and of course that piece is also wanted by a vilain as it is giving you worldpower.

But she is so perfect at this role that it is easy to see that these movies are more plausible - one just needs to find the right actress in the right role.The supporting roles as well are aptly filled by all. I suspect that a great movie starts with proper casting, continues with photography, production, directing and acting. In this case all were top notch. 10/10-ZafoidPS: I don't understand why the IMDb.com general populace would rate this so low with an average rating of 5/10! Trust me this is an A+ movie.-Z",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
108,bh_tafe3,Fun film which I never really got the hate for,6,28 June 2014,"Don't misquote me. This is hardly a touchstone moment for film making, but this is easily the best film based on a video game. Bringing in some fun set pieces, interesting, though flawed, puzzles and a plot with just the right amount, if not slightly too much, stupid, Simon West produced a winner, if only a modest one, here.There are plenty of negatives to discuss here. The plot is pretty unengaging. It's basically just there to give Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft an excuse to well, raid tombs. But the puzzle does keep us interested enough for the film not to drag. The film seems to borrow from Raiders of the Lost Ark in some scenes, Die Hard in others and the Goonies in others and is a bit of a mish mash of different styles, but like I said, never gets boring or too jarring.Along for the ride are Noah Taylor (Shine) and Chris Barrie (Red Dwarf), as Croft's assistants and Jon Voight (Oscar winner for Coming Home) as her deceased father. The bad guys are fairly bland, despite being played by quality actors in Iain Glen and Daniel Craig.In the end Lara Croft: Tomb Raider basically does what it say on the label, and Jolie was simply born to play Croft. Decent movie, better than it's rating here would indicate. Though if you are looking for a similar movie which is better, try National Treasure. Still, not a bad effort and worth a watch if you like adventure flicks.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
109,Dockelektro,Forget it,4,25 March 2002,"It's March and my home city of Lisbon has been swept by a heat wave. It's Summer, and Spring has started a few days ago. What to do besides drinking a beer at the local cafe? Let's rent a movie. A no brainer. We were not expecting a very good movie, but there is a limit to our tolerance. And Tomb Raider is overwhelming with lack of cinematic taste or originality. I have seen too many bad movies, but this one still manages to hit some points in the novelty area among them. Angelina Jolie is annoying, just those lips are enough. She moves very sexily, but, frankly, the plot is confusing, it has false endings and most of all it tires the viewer. I gave up on this movie at the one hour mark, I was too tired, and the movie was annoying me big time. No charisma, no magic, no talent. Just money. Forget it. I did.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
110,kermitkid,Stupid but fun,7,31 March 2020,"I know nothing about the games. Going in, I was expecting this to be a fun, silly, stupid but fun stupid movie and that's exactly what I got so I can't really complain. It does have a lot of problems, particularly from the story. It doesn't make a lot of sense, there are subplots that are never resolved, and it's just lazily written, and it was really just an excuse for action scenes and slow-mo shots (which are awesome, by the way). The acting isn't really all that great, particularly from Daniel Craig, but this was one of his first big movies, so I'll be more forgiving of his performance. I just wish they hadn't cast a Brit to do an American accent and an American to do a British accent. It feels like Jolie and Craig had a contest between takes where they would try to one-up the other's true accent, and it's just distracting and silly. Would I recommend it? Not really, but if you want to get some feel for what Tomb Raider is (which doesn't even really do that, since they don't really raid tombs in this movie. False advertising) before you see the remake in March, it's ok. It was pretty much exactly what I expected, so I can't complain a lot, but I'm hoping the remake tries a little harder.

111,barberoux,Pout and Boobs.,4,24 November 2001,Tomb Raider was a ridiculous movie with a barely coherent plot.  Jolie shows nothing but tight tops and a lippy pout.

The ludicrous plot about the planets aligning always surprises me that's what the writers went with, as opposed to you know, raiding tombs?I watched the special features on the blu-ray and saw one of the creators make a statement that the film wasn't at all ""cheesy, corny or camp"" - did this guy watch the same version I did? The film is all of those things, from the opening scene in which Lara fights a training robot to then insert a mix-tape cassette, Lara's padded pointy breasts, and not forgetting the film ends on a freeze frame shot of Lara holding her guns - yeah not at all...If somehow you've never seen this film until today, don't take it at all seriously or you won't enjoy it, just switch your brain off and you'll likely get something out of it.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
116,basrutten,Like Indiana Jones but without the fun,4,15 March 2002,"Contains spoilersTomb Raider is not exactly a very intelligent film. For starters, the plot makes very little sense. OK, it's not quite as mind-boggingly stupid as ""BattleField Earth"", but you're constantly wondering why on earth somebody would do what the characters in this movie do. Would anyone risk the existence of the world just in order to see your father again ? Lara does. And why on earth doesn't the bad guy just shoot Lara after she gives him the triangle piece ? And why do the bad guys suddenly abandon their leader ?As for the dialogue, it's all extremely dull and silly. I can't remember having laughed once at the so-called jokes. It's all so incredibly boring.Both of the complaints above would be excusable if only the action would have been good. And Tomb Raider also fails in this department. Sure, the battles (with robots, statues, soldiers) look good, but the bad guys go down ridiculously easy (the aforementioned statues just crumble when hit by bullets, did you ever see a statue get destroyed by a couple of machine gun rounds ?) and Miss Croft is almost completely invincible.Tomb Raider is a complete piece of crap, but it's boring, doesn't make sense and has mediocre action.Well, I suppose I could give it *1/2 out of **** stars",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
117,TheHande,Not to be taken seriously.,7,16 October 2006,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is neither the best nor the most intelligent video game film I've seen, but as a no-brainer action flick it succeeds in all areas. Amazing action sequences, impressive CGI and light-hearted humour to balance it all out.Undoubtedly the plot and narrative could have been a little more coherent, but the movie undoubtedly has a nice feeling of mystery with the artifacts and things. The only area where the film truly fails is to produce anything deep or meaningful, except for Lara's relationship with her father.The reason I'm not such a big fan of the film comes from the reason I don't enjoy the games. They're both essentially no-brainers and there's little to nothing in them to make them very distinct. Still as an action-flick Tomb Raider fills its purpose, being entertaining.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Of course, this should have nothing to do with it.  A film based on other material should stand on its own as a film, but unfortunately I thought that this one was curiously flat and lacking excitement.I felt that there was never any sense that Lara was in any real danger.  If you look at any action adventure film you know full well that John McClane, Indiana Jones, James Bond, et al. are going to survive, and with a ready quip, go sailing into the sunset with the girl at the end of the movie, but at least there is the impression that maybe, just maybe, on the way they will be shot, beaten up, bruised, damaged and maybe even killed.  Not this film.  Lara came across as indestructible, arrogant and absolutely in control all of the time.Disappointing, and a waste of fine performers like Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig and Iain Glen.  Nice effects though, and nice scenery, but these do not a movie make.  I hope that if they do a second film that it will be better.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

120,MF210,An enjoyable film,8,12 October 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. I have said it before and I will say it again: 2001 was one of the worst years in movies. However, during the Summer it did offer its share of enjoyable ""Popcorn movies."" Tomb Raider was one of them.
Tomb Raider is about as intelligent as my dog, actually my dog is a little bit more intelligent. But this movie is more fun to watch than my dog, especially since she cant do any cool flips. Tomb Raider is your typical summer movie. Its high on action but low on intelligence.If your looking for action, Tomb Raider has a great deal. Whether its in a very nice looking mansion or in an ancient temple in Cambodia. All the action scenes are well done and are not tiresome. The Visual Effects are mostly good. The cinematography is also beautiful in Cambodia.
The best female action heroes in films are Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor, you may now add Lara Croft to that list. Croft was an awesome video game character, but Angelina Jolie makes her an awesome movie character. I cant believe she got a Razzie Nomination for this, thats just dumb. Noah Taylor does a solid job as her partner. Daniel Craig is flat in his performance. Iain Glen is also flat as the villain, he doesnt really make any part of the character evil. If there is a big problem in Tomb Raider it is the dialogue and some of the editing. Im not counting story because story is not that important in summer movies. The dialogue is quite cheesy and painful in areas. I noticed where they screwed up in the editing. Its the scene at the end where Jolie goes through the big sun globe or whatever you call it. She places the clock on there and ends up with the 2nd piece of the triangle but she ends with the clock the enext second later. I know Lara is amazing but even she cant get it that fast. Many people will say Tomb Raider is just dumb and a waste of time. Well, thats what its made for. Yes, like I said its not intelligent but you dont go to a movie like this to think. You go if you have an hour and 45 minutes to waste.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie pops up as Lara's butler and the two have genuine chemistry together when they are on screen. The film is very well directed by Simon West and it has a very polished sheen to it all plus the pacing is spot on, which for a game adaptation is rarer than hen's teeth.Smashing good fun which is surprisingly well made and well performed too.Highly recommended for a boozy Saturday in or a lazy Sunday on the couch.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The plot was predictable and standard (it was too video game, considering Sommers wanted to make it more plotworthy and less gamish), the CGIs were mostly yawnable, the final scene dragged on *way* too long...and Angelina's padded bosom was so obviously padded it was laughable...and come on, I know millions of teenaged gamer-geekboys are paying to see it, and I know it's Lara Croft, but the bounce-factor was amusingly high...There were a couple of really good scenes, on the other hand. The mansion fight scene was *really* sweet for example...and I liked the Cambodian temple scene (even though it said The Mummy in really big letters;), and the scenery was mostly really pat. And Angelina did inject a lot of charisma into Lara, she has the athleticism, looks and charm to pull it off well enough. Unfortunately she was pretty much the shining light in a very poor stable of actors...Jon Voight has seen better days (and what was with that ET meets Obi-Wan scene near the end...UGH!!) although it was kinda cool seeing Angelina's daddy playing her daddy;) The only actor outside of Jolie worth watching was Chris Barrie (the hilarious Arnold Rimmer on Red Dwarf...I was *very* pleasantly surprised to see him there...)Overall: About what I expected...pretty much a James Bond/Indiana Jones/Mummy rehash, but it had its moments.

123,craig-hopton,Not a good movie but at least they tried,4,16 March 2013,"There's no getting away from the fact that this is a pretty dire movie. There are only really two things going for it:1) Angelina Jolie who is of course the perfect casting for Lara Croft. And I'm not just talking about her looks - she handles the actions scenes superbly.2) They have done a decent job of carrying the essence of the computer game's fast-paced yet light-hearted action sequences over to the movie.But I'm afraid these pluses only sustain the movie for the first half an hour or so. It soon becomes tied up in the ridiculous treasure-hunting plot. There isn't a single original or interesting twist or turn in the whole thing. It becomes interminably boring. Even Iain Glen and Daniel Craig's scheming characters fail to provide any interest bar looking utterly incompetent as treasure-hunters throughout.Sorry, but I found this really hard-going.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I don't doubt for a second that early civilizations had theknowledge and the abilitiy to build machinery like the one we seein the movie, but still ... the function of these are to far fetched, evenfor a self-proclaimed believer.3.

I only played the second game in the series and I thought a Tomb Raider movie could be fun.  The bad reviews didn't bother me. Pearl Harbor and Godzilla got bad reviews and I enjoyed those movies for what they were. But I didn't expect it to be THIS BAD.  I slightly enjoyed only a couple of scenes, but the rest of the movie was boring, stupid and BORING. No tension, no plot twists, NOTHING. The action scenes didn't have anything new. We've seen it all before done much better.  Some special effects were nice, but not spectacular. It really felt like watching a direct-to-video movie. BAD, BAD, BAD. Angelina Jolie is a great actress, but even she failed to save the movie. She looks fake and even slightly annoying in this idiotic mess. The script writers should be banned from Hollywood.

129,thomvic,It's entertaining but totally forgettable........,5,7 November 2010,"**********May contain slight spoilers*********** OK I never played the games before but everyone knows Lara Croft. So my whole family went to see this movie and we were pretty excited. When we came out of it, we were thinking how some of the scenes were pretty cool and how Angelina was a pretty good action actress - then when you think about it harder, you start to see the cracks that were not covered up.The plot - well Lara Croft is a millionaire who owns a big mansion and goes on quests to search for lost artefacts almost like Indiana Jones - though he does it with a bit more style. When the lunar eclipse sets off an alignment which will enable hunters of the triangle of light to be obtained, with the two pieces hidden on opposite ends of the Earth (one in Cambodia, the other in Siberia), Lara must stop the baddies from obtaining it for using its power for evil.Hahahahah yeah this is soooooooo original. The main problem is that with this plot, how come they always have to split up the bloody item instead of destroying it in the first place when it could have solved the problem in the first place? It just doesn't make sense to me that a civilisation who was so smart to make such an object is even stupider in working out the best way to get rid of it.Now when it comes to Angelina, I thought she played Lara Croft pretty well. The only problem is - the character is so stuck up and over confident it makes all the action scenes and sense of danger pointless almost because you know she will get out of it. For example, when she goes to Angkor to get the first triangle, the statues coming alive showed no fear in her at all. It's almost like 'oh OK this is just another day, no problem' reaction from her. I am guessing this is how Lara Croft would be but I didn't expect her to be so annoying.Then you have the subplot with Lara's dead father which tries but fails to add any emotional depth to this. The music in the movie was alright at times and at other times felt like I was in some sort of grunge/heavy metal concert.The visuals I will say are pretty good and Angelina is the perfect Lara Croft but they could have done so more with her. The sequel is better in my opinion but has similar mistakes as the first.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Every level has a multitude of unintelligent opponents followed by an end fight with a slightly more challenging enemy. The film even includes the training level at the start.

Angelina Jolie is perfect as Laura Croft and the U2 song 'elevation' on the soundtrack was great. Other than that, this movie is nothing special.

The idea of making a movie out of a computer game sounds enough crazy to justify making a movie but looking at the outcome gives an impression that I was only watching someone else playing a computer game. And watching a computer game makes you feel really bored if you're never going to get a chance to play by yourself.Perhaps I could have gotten a lot more out of this if I had played the computer game, but because I never had, I didn't know what this was supposed to be. Maybe it is too easy to make comparisons with this and something similar, like Indiana Jones, but the mysteries seemed to me utterly random and uninteresting. In Tomb Raider there are just not enough drama to support storyline and this is not really a movie at all. Probably Tomb Rider is more interesting as a production outcome than as a real movie, and that they got Jolie to play the lead was an achievement you have to give some credit for.I have never been more unsure about the score in any other film except this, I only give this low rating as a warning for those who were looking for another action-adventure.

The plot is confusing and pretty much stupid, though you should take note on the beautiful locations.ACTING: Nothing special at all, i was actually getting sick of Jolie arching one eyebrow and blowing the hair out of her face, the acting was too simple.ACTORS: I was surprised, i was expecting more or less famous people in this film, most were a bunch of unknowns, Jolie was the only real star.SCRIPT: Very confusing, and its totally lost the plot, Lara (Jolie) travels all corners of the world and very quickly may i add, shes looking for a clock, a clock that re-gains time, its all too stupid to even remember, they could have thought of something better.CINEMA: Cinematopgraphy, well there are some beautiful locations, and good looking artifacts and gadgets, so it all looks nice, shame about the story though.THRILLS: The first five minutes and final 10 minutes are the most action packed, lots of jumping, flying, bashing and stabbing... Overall not VERY thrilling, but 15 minutes actuall worth watching.MUSIC: Pretty good, during the action sequences there is some great music, suites the atmosphere very well, the music wasnt top 40, it was really nympho, i liked it.OVERALL: Well, i must say i was fairly disappointed, it wasnt really a good film, sure Angelina looks great, but im sure she was casted to increase her fame, a very average movie, and should be chucked in to the ""Games to Movies"" section, and yes its not a success.** 2 OUT OF 5 STARS",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
144,emfern13,"An excellent adaption, all in all just excellent",10,1 March 2002,This movie was a great adaption to the video game. Angelina Jolie is Lara Croft. Her house is the same and is very good. Her costumes are excellent. This may be different from the video game but that is a very good thing. It makes it more interesting and mysterious. The clock in the movie is very beautiful and so is the cinematography. Angelina Jolie is beautiful. This is on my top 100 at number 3. The first time i saw which was on the opening day i did not pay much attention because i just got out of school but it was still interesting. The second time i saw it i loved this movie. It was my favorite. Until Rush Hour 2 and then Ali but it is still awesome. It did not do very well here in america. I mean it did do well but the director thought it would do much better.,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
145,emfern13,This Movie Rocks,10,8 June 2002,"This movie totally rocks. I love this movie. I think it does have its set of problems. Some of the dialogue in this movie was pretty flat and some of the acting was kind of poor. There was lots of action and awesome sets. The people spent so much time on the sets that there is an excuse for the mediocre script. Jolie was the best actor in this movie, she looked like and acted like Lara Croft. She did a great job and must have gotten alot of exercise.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
146,WilsonLau,Good but easily forgetable,3,16 June 2001,"This movie wasn't bad. Many of the aspects were very loosely explained, kinda like: this is happening, and this is why(and they'd give a cheesey unbelieveable reason) so deal with it. Like their explaination of how easily she got from England to Cambodia via a military war plane hauling her and her jeep was just to suddenly show a picture of her with some war buddies and thats supposed to instantly give her capability to a war plane, and access to Cambodian air space, not to mention all the other country's air space that she'd have to pass through. The story was very simple and straight forward. The characters are ""super cool"" and badass. The acting was what you'd expect for a movie such as this. The action scenes were decent but not even close to what has been already done. This was a fun movie to watch though and its never boring when Angelina Jolie is around.Although a lot of things in this movie are far-fetched it was still good. I wouldn't consider this a summer blockbuster thats for sure.7/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
147,RoboRabbit89,Angelina Jolie makes Tomb Raider rock!,6,1 February 2018,"I was 11 at the time, my dad and I seen this back in 2001,
and I have to tell you I totally loved it, my dad did as well.
 I own it on VHS which I found in 2010 when my library had it, and was giving it away, then in 2015 I found a decent copy on DVD at a flea market. The year before the films release, I had recently bought the video game
 ""Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation"", for PS1 but never got far on it,
 hell I still haven't beaten the game yet.Angelina Jolie was a great choice to play Lara Croft, she was my first crush 
and she's super sexy in this, and around this time she looked her best,
 my friends and I agree that she looks great looking in it too.Because nowadays she still looks good but she needs to take better care of herself, I want her to make movies for a long time. 
She also looks like a living incarnation of the character from the original game
series, it's quite uncanny to tell you the truth.Now, I don't know much about the the games but I love this movie.
This is basically a female version of Indiana Jones, a clone of it,
if you you will, but director Simon West did a great job of just making
a fun adventure film. I didn't like Con Air but I liked this film very much.On to the action, the action scenes are great, exciting and fun and
very well paced, I mean the movie runs at 100 minutes but you don't
really notice because the movie is so entertaining, which is good.Her real life father Jon Voight is also good in this but he's mostly
in flash back scenes so if your a fan of his, that's a little heads up.
I recently seen him in the film ""Runaway Train"" from 1986,
that film was also good too, but more on that for anther review.The rest of the cast is forgettable but I still liked them as well,
especially the main baddie called Powell, he was very good in his part.
Angelina's fight at the end with Powell was very cool too.Overall a fun adventure film that is pure escapist entertainment
from start to finish. I give it a solid 6.8/10. If your thinking of seeing
this, you should see it, Angelina is very hot and just so bad ass
at the same-time which is fun. Highly recommended.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
148,MadBadMovieman,Lots of Action and effects but a better script would help.,6,3 July 2001,"Overall, we liked this movie.  Angelina was Very good in a somewhat un-defined part.  Not enough depth to really truly like her.  Beautiful but not always convincing.  The only men in her life besides her devoted assistants (Real characters!) all made you wonder if she had been shallow growing up. Some special effects were unusual and interesting.  Others were almost cartoonish.(Genetic defects from spawning out of a Video Game perhaps?) The clock was good.  The gizmo at the end was not.We think she was Noble.  Her father maybe.  No information about why she had no mother.  This was a BIG hole in her background.  Then to try and sum up her search and her Father's reasons for his actions in one scene was too much.If they make a sequel, spend more money on the screenplay.  She CAN Act. Just give her something to work with.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
149,miro-6,"Oh, what delusion!",6,16 June 2001,"I have been waiting for this movie four years. I have been dreaming to watch a great great movie from when I saw the trailer for the first time. What delusion! The scene-painting is the only great thing in this movie. The story is old fashion, stupid and boring. The way to shot remember me the old (too old) 007 movies. Angelina Jolie (before this movie I loved her) is pathetic in acting and runs like a paralyzed woman. Action is too little, also if is not so little as ""Pearl Harbor"" (which is the ""The battlefield hearth"" of the 2001, the scam of the year, the delusion of the delusions). The director, Simon West, should go back to shot advertising spots forhomekeeper women, the real target of this movie, which we have to don't forget that comes from an action videogame. Now I hope that ""Final Fantasy"" and ""The fast and the Furious"" will be not the same delusion. Oh ""Shrek"" where are you? I want see you other ten times if my destiny is that. My vote is 5 on 10, my rate is C- and I'm generous. Go and see but without great illusions.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
150,joncha,A comic book film,7,25 June 2001,"Although it's based on a video game, Tomb Raider really falls into a category of bringing a comic book character, i.e. Superman or Wonder Woman, to the screen. For that reason, it's important to fill the audience in on the character's background early and then develop some concern for what happens to that individual (or at least for the individual's purpose in life, if not for the character as a person). Two movies that did this well were ""Superman"" and ""Batman."" You could never had read a comic book about either and still understand early into the film how and why they were what they were. Unfortunately, we don't get that type of presentation about Lara Croft, although the script tried to do so. I think presenting some of her history in chronological order, rather than as flashbacks, would have helped. Also, making the butler into a hunk of questionable sexual orientation instead of the dottering old guy from the video game was a mistake, as it created a new relationship element that raised more questions rather than develop the character's role. (The older butler also would have provided a link to Lara's past, no doubt having worked originally for her father.) Adding the nerd/techno whiz was also a mistake, as it made Lara's home into a giant laboratory with a bedroom attached. Finally, the plot could have been smaller in scope, in that Lara didn't have to be saving the world from ultimate destruction. This doesn't leave much for a sequel or sequels, which can become repetitious. To paraphrase Captain Kirk in one of the latter Star Trek movies, ""Once more, we're off to save the Universe!""",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
151,RestlessRust,Almost as Entertaining as Super Mario Brothers (the Movie),4,18 June 2001,"I'm not kidding, this movie is barely ""okay"".  What little action there is fails to invigorate, and the sequences between the action play like cutscenes from a video game.  My 14-year-old son nearly fell asleep.  I couldn't have blamed him if he had, but it's just as well--then he would have been up all night talking about what a dull movie this was.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
152,Blackace,Tomb Raider Movie Average. Angelina Jolie Perfect.,6,23 June 2001,"After reading the reviews on Tomb Raider on IMDB, there is no doubt that this movie received mixed reviews. Many people loved it and many people hated it. My state newspaper gave it 4 stars. Not sure what movie he was watching. Tomb Raider is NOT a 4 star movie. The Matrix is a 4 Star Movie. What really hurts this movie is the terrible plot and all the loop holes it provides. Why the hell would the ancients break a key  artifact into 2 pieces if they didn't want people to piece it back together? They could have easily smashed it into a thousand pieces. And what's up with the stone guards who protect these pieces? You shoot them once and they shatter into a million pieces. How stupid is this? The plot bounces around so much, it's ridiculous. One minute Lara is in her house, the next time she's half-way across the world. The time machine looked like the octopus ride at Six Flags. The movie started out pretty strong. Lara fighting an agile robot monster in a dungeon lair was very cool. *SPOILER COMING*  Then we find out it's just a training room and the robot was designed by her assistant. From there the movie starts to go downhill. Lara finds a unique key in an old clock under the main stairs in her home. Apparently it was left there by her father and she was able to find it by hearing it tick all the way from her bedroom (100 yards away). In any case more research is done and they find out that this device is the key to finding the 2 pyramid pieces that when pieced together during the planets alignment, can control time. The main adventure is Lara traveling from one ends of the Earth to the other to find the pieces.Of course there is a bad guy in all of this named Alex Marrs who will stop at nothing to get these pieces before Lara. Some of the action scenes are decent, but a bit far-fetched. True, this is a movie based on a video game, but even the games weren't this unbelievable. Then again.. The only shining part of this movie is Angelina Jolie who does a great job portraying Lara Croft. Those poutty lips and busty front is Lara all the way and Angelina is great with the guns. Angelina has Lara's English accent down perfectly. The only thing Angelina doesn't have is Lara's hips and butt. Unfortunately Angelina can't save this movie from mediocrity and old school story-telling. If you do plan to see this movie, see the Matinee..please. I spent $18 seeing this mess with my girlfriend. I gave this movie a 6. It would have gotten less if it weren't for Mrs. Jolie and a few good action scenes. Nuff said.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
153,FilmFan777,Just my opinion,5,9 June 2001,"Though I wasnt all that excited to see the film I went with an open mind (and the want of seeing Jolie, hehe) If you want a sexy looking lead...you've got it! (yet they really didnt need the prosthetic boobs)If you want plenty of action...you've got it. If you want a believible inter-twineing story...you dont have it. Though the film is full of adventure and even action, there are far too many unbelievable incidents. As if the films makers expected everyone to know the history and complete backround of the character and story. And I must say, Angelina didnt help make this character as believable as she could. In my opinion that lands in the lap of the same director who did 'The General's Daughter' (ick) To beat the hell out of wave after wave of professionally trained, fully geared mercinary's without breaking the smallest sweat or vagueist shortness of breath 'and' being in your pajama's...I'm sorry. Just too much for me. Another example is riding a motorcycle, out running auto machine gun fire while doing wheelies on the 'front' wheel and still shooting guys hiding behind crates, I just say, enough. Not to mention the 'this is a cake walk' grin the character yields at every feat. Now, if you take it far less serious, dont care about the how's where's when's, who's and all that, then you just might enjoy this film. Yea, I did enjoy it and dont mean to 'completly' bash it because I was entertained by some of it. Yet knowing a bit about Tomb Raider, I feel this production team didnt pull off what they should or could have. They fell just a bit too short for me. Again...pointing to the director in my humble opinion. But...dont go by simply by what I say. Go and see if for yourself and draw your own opinion. I will say, Angelina Jolie was an excellent choice for this film. However, with the right director I belive this film could have been taken more to the heights it should have achieved.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
154,TheArgentWolf,The best video game-turned-movie,10,18 May 2005,"Being a nerdy addict of the game, I personally couldn't wait for the film, so I'm glad that I wasn't disappointed. True, Tomb Raider comes from a long line of games that are turned into movies - but I definitely think that this is by far the best.I thought Angelina's acting and accent was brilliant, and I can't think of anyone else who would've been more suited to playing Lara. The chemistry between her and Daniel Craig was so good.The plot line was good too, and stayed loyal to the general idea of the game - in fact, I think the film should have been made into a game in it's own right! Another thing I liked about this movie was the soundtrack - the right music was fitted into the right places, and I think it is one of the best movie soundtracks available.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
155,eibon04,"Condensed, Tame Action Film without a Bite",3,17 February 2002,"Not a totally wasteful film for there are a couple of fascinating ideas that are not properly channeled by the film makers, and cast.  Angelina Jolie is a talented actress whose talents are not put to any good use with her one dimensional characterization creation of the filmmakers.  Lara Croft:Tomb Raider(2001) lacks the sense of danger, feeling of wonder, and cliff hanging suspense that the Indiana Jones films excelled in.  One of the few good performances in the film are given by Doctor Menard himself, Richard Johnson who performs with an uttermost perfessionalism.  For an action film it lacks any cool scenes or action and is missing any kind of tension which makes action films interesting.  To any viewer who loves adventure films, I suggest the Indiana Jones movies, or even the early silent films of Fritz Lang, ala, Dr. mabuse the Gambler, or Die Niebulegen.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
156,Ripe Peach,Tomb Raider plumbs the depths,1,18 June 2001,"Just when I thought Mummy Returns had hit rock bottom, Angelina Jolie tunnels through into a whole new seam of dross.Good points:  Jolie showing skin and wearing a (badly) padded bra.  That's enough for adolescent boys to give this a 10, apparently.Bad points:  Everything else.  The ""plot"", such as it is, is stolen from a South Park episode.  You think I'm kidding?  Mecha Striesand.  The dialogue could have been written by a twelve year old, but as that's the target audience, this is no real surprise.  The message is ""superior firepower solves everything and violence has no consequences"".  Sad, but not unusual.But it gets worse.  Jolie's accent is cringe inducing.  Her acting consists of a series of poses and pouts that would look cheesy in a porn flick. There's never any suggestion that she's in danger, and we wouldn't care anyway.  The action scenes are dull, uninvolving, derivative and shoddily made.  The CGI is ropey.  The score grates and blares in competition with the visuals.  This is a desultory, joyless film, made by talentless clock-watchers.Sure, Tomb Raider is a popcorn flick.  But it's a BAD popcorn flick. Contrast with Men In Black, Galaxy Quest or American Pie.  Tomb Raider is a sad, bad, nasty little piece of exploitation.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
157,TimBoHannon,"Finally, a Game-to-Movie Translation that Succeeds",7,5 April 2008,"Video games and movies are wildly different formats of entertainment. The original ""Tomb Raider"" games are among my favorite. I am also a big fan of the ""Metal Gear Solid"" and ""Castlevania"" series, plus the original ""Max Payne."" Many video game-to-cinema conversions have been attempted before, and almost uniformly resulted in abject failure. I cringed when I read that ""Metal Gear,"" ""Max Payne,"" and ""Castlevania"" were the next targets for assassination. There is one example to follow for whoever leads those projects. ""Tomb Raider"" Director Simon West, the five other contributing writers, and lead producers Lawrence Gordon, Colin Wilson and Lloyd Levin were able to accept the idea that less is more, and in doing so created the only video game adaptation worth viewing. That is their example.The film opens with a long, zooming shot out of Lara Croft's (Angelina Jolie) eye and opens to what appears to be an Egyptian ruin. Just as the intrepid Croft zeroes in on her target artifact, she is wildly attacked bya robot? The adrenaline starts right away as she battles a machine so sturdy it is a wonder the military does not deploy them en masse. The tomfoolery is not finished as the film shows off all of Lara's signature moves from the video games. It is soon revealed that the whole battle is no more than a training drill right outside her 83-room house.Then the movie flashes to a meeting of the Illuminati. The council demands an update on the search for a ""key"" that will allow them to find ""the triangle"" during the alignment of the nine planets. The whole key and triangle business is a bit confusing at first, but the film does its viewer the justice of explaining it all thoroughly and repetitively. No, does not make much sense, but it gels together nicely, which is really what is most important in films dealing with the preposterous supernatural. Whether it is ""Highlander"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" it can only work if all of its elements are believable in relation to each other.Although that important task is met, the film ultimately lives and dies by the actress playing Lara Croft. To the gaming world, she is more than a mere heroine; she is a legend. She is the first sexy video game character, and her athletic maneuvers were ground breaking at the time. It was the most critical casting decision since Batman, and perhaps even Superman.Physically, Angelina Jolie bears the closest resemblance to the character, right down to her height, hair, and sexiest-woman-alive figure. Just as importantly, she imbues the part with the right mixture of attitude, confidence, toughness and, yes, tenderness. Her acting goes far beyond the lines and the blocking. Her posture and body movement, from the way she sits to how she walks and smooths her hair, communicate a lot about what is happening in Lara's pretty head. When her caring butler (Christopher Barrie) says a lady should be modest, she drops the towel from her shoulders and replies, ""Yes, a *lady* should be modest."" ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is not high drama, but I genuinely felt for Lara during her key emotional scene towards the end. It was then that I knew how much Jolie persuaded me to buy into her character. That she can bring wholly convincing tears to a far-fetched story speaks well of her acting abilities. Her quality is equally high in the athletic segments, as when she relaxes while somersaulting a mid-air ballet in her huge main hall. Moments later, she becomes lethal fighting force in a well above standard action scene.All of this is good, but the film would falter had the creative team tried to overstep their bounds. The mistake of trying cram in too much plot or action would be fatal. Video games can have more plot and a greater number of locations because they take many hours to finish, 10-20 in the case of a Tomb Raider game. The film clocks in at a slick 100 minutes and has only two exotic sets. Its movement is quick and straightforward, and Director West does not try to break any records with the action. There is only one ""ancient curse"" battle, and the highly impressive creatures have bodies even more fragile than ours.From a supporting standpoint, Iain Glen shines the most. He plays the Illuminati who sits ""at God's right hand"" with wily charm. His accent and deliberate delivery add distinctiveness to the part. I love the way he says ""Ancient cosmological models"" with careful, accented enunciation that slightly slows down with every word. Richard Johnson is the ""Distinguished Gentleman"" with a grim scowl, and it is delightful to see the pre-James Bond Daniel Craig.At the end of the day, ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" succeeds because of Jolie's savvy and self-control by the creative powers. It never reaches the level of the Indiana Jones movies, nor does it try to. It excels within its limits, and the quality action and superlative set design secure the only victory to date in a risky game.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
158,Mike Astill,The best no-brain actioner so far this year,7,9 July 2001,"Basing a film on a cult figure can be a dangerous thing, not least because of the past record of comparative failures (Judge Dredd, Tank Girl et al). Good job then that Tomb Raider is a cracking yarn that provides good solid entertainment the whole running time. It's certainly more fun than The Mummy Returns or Evolution.Angelina Jolie was the perfect choice to play upper-crust, globe-trotting nutter Lara Croft, and the opening scenes of the film showing her as an eccentric archaeologist are spot on. Her computer geek hanger-on is a necessary annoyance, but gets some good lines, and Chris Barrie's stuffy butler is a laugh - shame he wasn't in it more.Leaving aside the plot and characterisation (like they're important in ANY film like this), we get to follow Lara on her adventures around the world, taking in some gorgeous scenery and impressive set-pieces, especially the two 'tombs' (OK, they're not proper tombs, but anyone who's actually played these games will know that the look and feel of them are spot on).Complaints about plot-holes are largely superfluous, as even a small amount of reasoning or imagination can get you past them. What's important is that this is a fun and feisty homage to a larger-than-life video game star, and the best no-brain actioner so far this year.Time to plan the sequel? Absolutely.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

She, may i add, did the best job in the whole flick. It's like when she's one screen, which is almost evry moment of the whole movie, it's like all the other characters can just disappear. She looks great in the movie too, and i like her with an english accent. I personally think she should stick to the kind of films that got her famous, and win another Oscar.

Angelina Jolie IS Lara Croft.  She could not have been better.  The story revolves around a classic quest, the stuff adventure games like Tomb Raider are made of.   Perhaps those who criticize the story were expecting 'War and Peace' ... but hey ... it's a video game, bucko, not a literary work!In short, the action scenes, stunts and locations are excellent -- at least as good as most James Bond flicks.  Lara keeps her cool throughout, challenging aggressors with an enticing grin on her drop-dead gorgeous face. She's as independent, unstoppable and hard to control in the movie as she is in the game.  My only complaint is that the plot is too predictable at times.  A bit more suspense here and there would have made it a better film.If you've played the game (as I have), you gotta LOVE it!

Sure it's pretty to look at with some impressive movements on the part of the characters, but shortly it became an exercise in boooooring tedium.  Then comes the movie.  A good movie (or at least a fun, mindless action film) could have been made with this adventurous character at the heart of the story, but guess what? It's pretty to look at with some impressive bits, but it soon becomes an exercise in boooooring tedium. Ms. Jolie looks phenomenal, and does a nice job though.  Even though she looks kind of expressionless during action scenes, she leaps, rolls, punches and kicks nicely....somebody give her a decent action flick to star in.  Her charisma is the only thing I really liked about the film, but she's so far above the material, it serves as a hindrance as well.  About halfway through the movie I stopped paying attention, so I can't even really explain the plot.  Some flashy action scenes come off as flat, due to limited interest in the characters (with the villains being totally uninteresting-a major sin with action movie making), but I actually liked the moment where the giant multi-armed statue comes to life.

164,ichabod81,Quality surgically removed.,4,10 June 2004,"I don't play videogames, so I'm probably not as familiar with Croft as many others. That said, in my opinion, this movie clearly would've had potential. Big busted heroine taking what she wants with two guns blazing. Sounds hot, ay? The finished product is far from that.Biggest problem with Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is the editing. It's just simply appalling. Nobody goes to see this s**t for Lara's relationship with her dad. They pay the price for the action. Sadly, it doesn't work. Every time you think ""this is it, now she's gonna come from there, fling by the camera and boom! Awesome!"" they cut to some stupid angle that totally ruins the momentum. Such a shame.There are three good things here, though. The training fight with the robot is some what cool in the beginning of the picture. Plus the songs ""Where's your head at?"" by Basement Jaxx and ""Elevation"" by U2.

165,DorianWynHowells,A second look and you'll learn to accept it for what it is - a summer blockbuster.,6,7 February 2002,"When me and my mates went to see this in the cinema, we weren't really expecting a plot. We just went to see Angelina Jolie's luscious form as she personified the legendary computer game character! Most probably 99% of the male audience went to see it for the same sole purpose, considering it's box office success!I HATED this film when I first saw it, and thought it was a waste of time and money. But, I have to admit, on a second viewing, I learnt to accept it for what it was and sat back, and enjoyed.Jolie is great as Lara Croft. She is sexy, witty, strong, and intelligent. Great to look at, and the film plays to that strength, she knows it, the director knows it. Sex appeal is the first thing they had to nail, and they did! The second thing they had to nail on the head were the SFX, and I must say, whether it's in the cinema or in your home, this film is loud and the SFX are great! The set pieces are also well choreographed and they never really let up until we are completely safe and clear of danger. Mind you though, the film does drag a little bit when Lara 'mourns' for her lost father. But it doesn't really hurt the film.This is Jolie's film, and everyone else is just background material. The SFX are the only things that pose a danger for the viewers eye to wander away from Lara's physique!Iain Glen is o.k. as a one dimensional baddie, whereas Noah Taylor is just plain irritating!!! Chris Barrie? as a fan of Red Dwarf, he is welcome, and his few lines are delivered well.So, all in all, after giving this film a second chance, I enjoyed.

166,Soledad-2,A waste of time and money!,1,19 June 2001,"Few times in my life I have seen such a poor movie. I was so naive that seeing the theater totally full and having to wait for a long time because all was sold out, I had the strange feeling that ""this would be a great movie.""  I was wrong. The movie is a failure and my opinion is not based in my dislike for video games.  My daughter who is fifteen years old and her best friends dislike this movie as much as I do. My good advice: don't waste your time and money.  Watch anything else. Even the most mediocre movie made for television may excel this piece of garbage.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
167,SwingBatta,"This ""Tomb"" contains everything that makes for an excellent film",10,22 September 2001,"In 1999 it was ""Sleepy Hollow.""In 2000 it was ""Chicken Run.""And in 2001 it was ""Tomb Raider.""You're probably wondering, how are these three movies related?Well, I wasn't dying to see any of them at first, and after I did, I reacted indifferently to them all. Then, for some reason I may never figure out in this lifetime, I watched them again, and I was hooked.I mean hooked with a capital H. I mean hooked as in seeing all three a combined 70 times in the theaters.I don't know why I chose to see ""Sleepy Hollow,"" while ""Chicken Run"" was simply because SH's Miranda Richardson and ""AbFab's"" Julia Sawalha were in it. I will pay to see bad movies just for the fun of tearing them apart afterwards, and I watched ""Tomb Raider"" solely for the satisfaction of doing just that.I was not a TR fan. I thought the franchise was overrated. I rolled my eyes at the movie posters. I rated it a 7 and read negative reviews. In short, I wanted it to fail miserably. When I saw it again a week later, I hated it so much that I returned for nine days straight. I treated my family to a showing on the IMAX screen. I even begged my way out of work early on several occasions.Everyone's entitled to change their tune, aren't they?""Tomb Raider,"" directed by Simon West, is the complete package of a solid plot and script, witty dialogue, astounding action sequences and terrific acting. It's topped off with a delightful sense of humor; while it opens and ends with a bang and doesn't slip up in between, the movie also manages to poke some good-natured fun at itself.Now that I think about it, maybe I was destined to love this movie. Call me crazy, but I think it's because these films are connected in some strange way. For instance, I saw the SH trailer when I watched ""The Bone Collector,"" which starred Angelina Jolie. I saw the CR trailer when I watched ""Gone in Sixty Seconds,"" which starred Angelina Jolie. The surnames of the English-accented heroes (played by American actors, no less) of ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Tomb Raider,"" Ichabod Crane and Lara Croft, respectively, both begin with the letters C and R, the initials for ""Chicken Run."" They are both intelligent loners who are focused less on romance and more on justice - even if it means delving into the supernatural - and are affected by recurring nightmares about their deceased parents.Like SH and CR, the cast features distinguished British actors, who are not as recognized on this side of the Atlantic, playing alongside the American stars and turning in great performances. Chris Barrie (the lovable shotgun-wielding butler, Hillary) and Noah Taylor (tech wizard Bryce) are a very effective  but never overbearing or cliched  comic duo who, along with Lara, comprise a reverse-""Three's Company"" living arrangement.The shady characters are just as well-rounded as the good guys. Iain Glen is a delightfully devious Manfred Powell, a shifty, villainous lawyer who is just as clever as the hero; he uses Lara's weaknesses as his ace in the hole in hopes of thwarting her plans. Julian Rhind-Tutt shines as Powell's reluctant nervous Nellie assistant, Mr. Pimms. Daniel Craig pulls off a flawless American accent as the second-best character in the film, the slightly greasy Alex West, a tomb raider willing to stoop to any level to earn a fast buck. Leslie Phillips, Rachel Appleton and Robert Phillips succeed in smaller roles.But make no mistake, this is the Lara Croft Show, and she sure as hell doesn't disappoint.To say that Angelina Jolie was convincing in this role is a gross understatement.  She underwent a three-month crash course to get in shape for the part and suffered multiple injuries during the course of the shoot. But after, oh, ten seconds into the film, it's obvious the grueling work paid off in spades. She successfully plays out what made Lara Croft a worldwide phenomenon to begin with, right down to the British accent. Even something simple as flipping her two Heckler & Koch 45s was fun to watch. Most important of all, she makes us care about the character. It's hardly any wonder that she considers Lara to be the best character she's played.There is a great line from the film ""Little Voice"" in which Brenda Blethyn blathers, ""I bet that Judy Garland never went on stage in her bloody pajamas."" I'll bet she never jumped around forty feet in the air and ran around the walls on bungee cords while fighting armed intruders, or jumped a motorcycle over a fleet of cars in them, either. It's pretty amazing that Air Jolie performed nearly all her own stunts (the key word is ""nearly"": she wanted to do everything but stunt coordinator Simon Crane put his foot down), including the opening scene, plus hopping around a giant moving orrery and standing on a pendulum-like swinging log.The underground action is executed with more style and pizzazz than the ""Mummy"" films. Lara's gun battle with a towering six-armed ""boss"" creature (my favorite part) is already the stuff of legends, as is her Road Warrior-style Land Rover, which easily puts James Bond's BMWs to shame.
But while not busy raiding tombs and fending off gun-toting baddies, Lara always has an irrepressible and irresistible air of cool and slight arrogance about her. Whether it's flashing a coy grin, raising an eyebrow at a nasty eight-foot-tall droid or blowing a mischievous kiss to the leader of the evil Illuminati (Richard Johnson), she does some of the best camera mugging since Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future."" These all made for humorous segments, such as her reaction upon accidentally bidding on a pricey auction item, making light of a pile of rubble in her mansion to a hapless UPS courier (""I woke up this morning and just hated everything""), or whenever Lara interacted with Alex early in the film. (""Here on a tourist visa?"" she jeers when they meet in Cambodia.)The script integrates a solid backstory to the title character, which is evident in an emotional, touching scene involving a grief-stricken Lara and the specter of her late father, Richard Croft, played nicely by Jon Voight. (A highlight is watching him explain the history of the magic triangle.) I also liked how Powell frequently referred to Lara as Lady Croft.Peter Menzies, Jr.'s cinematography is excellent, particularly in exterior and interior master shots and a dizzying tracking of a speeding motorcycle weaving through traffic, and it adds intensity to the action scenes. Kirk Petruccelli's production design is awesome; the multileveled Cambodian tomb is the best set I've seen since SH's Western Woods (that's the truth; I'm not saying that as a fan). Coupled with the fantastic editing, it also makes for near-perfect transitions from actual locations to London soundstages.While part of Lara Croft's success is obviously centered around her sex appeal, the filmmakers wisely never go overboard with it because TR has a strong female fan base. It's not sexist in any manner; there is scarcely any cleavage, no excessively revealing outfits, nor any kissing or lovemaking scenes. The much-hyped shower scene is tastefully done  and it's even parodied as well. Heck, Lara even sleeps in plain old pajamas instead of a skimpy nightie.The only problem with ""Tomb Raider"" has nothing to do with the movie at all. It seems that it's as hip to soundly bash this picture as it is to be a Lara Croft fan. If people hated it, fine, but many have acted as if the movie had committed a criminal act against them, which is ridiculous. If everyone hated it, it certainly wouldn't have grossed $250 million worldwide. I believe that some naysayers were caught off guard by an action movie that contained a plot with a brain. These people are quick to label TR as campy or a ""popcorn flick""  a term I despise  which it certainly is not.""Tomb Raider"" is superior to the likes of ""Shrek"" and ""The Mummy Returns."" I saw it 17 times and have no regrets. If you're searching for an intelligent action film with heart and soul, then look no further.

It was even very much enjoyed by my mother, who usually discards movies like these. I very much suggest this movie to you, if you like great action, great acting, and you think Angelina Jolie is hot (woops, did I just say that?) It's about a British woman named Lara Croft (Jolie) who would do anything to bring her deceased father (Jon Voight) back to life. When she finds a mysterious artifact that can control time, she grabs at the chance to see her father again. Along the way she has to battle a rich villain and his henchmen (who, of course, only exist to get their butts kicked and shot by Croft).

Prancing about in tight clothing, saving the universe again and again.  Eye candy gone mad.  It almost has a Buckaroo Bonzi comic book syndication feel.

That it exposed them ... and they got served a major dose of whup-ass.I saw the making of it and a great deal of work and research went into it. The scenery and effects were fantastic and it had a great storyline. The temples were gorgeous as well.The movie showed Lara Croft (Angelina) and both as action hero and serene soul, which was a nice twist, as at first I thought she'd be a bitchy, superfluous version of Indiana Jones (even if her boobs were CGI enhanced ;) And it was nice to see her as action hero and real person. And Chris (Christopher) Barrie as her friend, aide and butler, Hillary was gorgeous too. It was lovely to see him in a production again. I miss his as Rimmer from Red Dwarf! :*) (He's also fantastic in Brittas Empire) I'm also ecstatic to find, doing net searches, that I'm not the only one who sees the amor between Lara & Hillary... ;) They worked so well together as actors and on screen characters.Wish I had one of those cool suspension swing things! And I thought my living room was big! I adore that scene, so soft and elegant in contrast to the fast action, dark fight scenes. I like how they brought sensitivity to Lara and seeing all the work that went into making the movie, even making the white pyjamas so they would flutter as she swung... And how much work, physical and emotional Angelina did to prepare for the role and how she really took it to heart, was really great to learn from the extra footage on the DVD.I wanted to see a bit more action, more of Lara pyjama fluttering and more scenes with her and Hillary, but apart from that it was awesome!

182,Pythe,Yet another mindless action flick,4,9 October 2007,"Filmmakers seem to think that, just because they load their movie with action and travel across several continents, they can compare it with Indiana Jones. This is because they have completely missed the point. Indiana is a great character because he's constantly in over his head; he really has no idea what he's doing and is making it up as he goes along. He's funny and likable; he's the everyman who does what he can against forces and enemies much larger than himself. And it's not just him; all the great action films--Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Terminator, Spider-Man, etc.--are about people who aren't quite up to the challenge handed to them. George Lucas once said that a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing. Well, an action sequence without an interesting character achieves the same effect.The main problem with this movie is that Lara Croft isn't terribly interesting. She's too sure of herself. She's not at all vulnerable. She's almost superhuman in strength, ability, and intelligence. It's like watching a robot. There's no reason to invest emotionally in her character. There's no sense of danger, and consequently no thrill as she jumps, slides, dodges, and dispatches effortlessly an army of assassins. Characters need to have a weakness, be it physical or emotional. The film's halfhearted answer to this is a vague backstory involving the death of her father, but nothing ever really comes of this. The only suspense the viewer feels is in wondering how long it's going to be until she takes off her clothes again. (A note for all fledgling filmmakers out there: if your entire film is built around a slow-motion shower sequence, you're in trouble.) I don't blame Angelina Jolie for this bland character, but I do blame her for choosing to work on this crappy assignment. She has proved she's quite capable as an actress; why she continues to portray one-dimensional characters in mediocre films is beyond me. What a waste of talent.Predictably, no other characters give us any reason to care about them, except the guy who makes the little robots, who I think might have actually been a better protagonist. It's all about who's prettiest, really. The action sequences try way too hard to be hip. The most ridiculous example of this is a simple dog sled chase, shot with shaky cameras, throbbing techno music, and lightning-fast cutting. Is it really necessary to get our adrenaline worked up over this? They're not even racing anybody, they're just going from point A to point B. I guess Simon West felt the need to illustrate the point that Lara doesn't do anything unless she does it IN STYLE. If the movie had shown her going to the supermarket to buy a loaf of bread, she probably would have crashed through the skylight, blown up the dairy counter to propel her cart down the aisle, snatched the bread, and back-flipped over the cashier in a rain of coins. If you took that sequence in Monty Python and the Holy Grail wherein Lancelet frantically crashes a wedding, slaughtering many innocent guests and toppling over wedding decorations for absolutely no reason, stretched it out to ninety minutes, put in a hot chick with a huge rack, and expected the audience to take it all seriously, you would have Tomb Raider.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Physically Angelina is perfect for the part but she can't carry this movie riddled with a bad script, campy acting, and bad directing. i don't know why Simon West was chosen to direct this because he has no experience in directing an action scene. The movie has some potential but in the end too many characters linked to Lara (Dad, and her two sidekicks, also her ex bf) ruin the movie, it should have been just a one woman show.

As in most other movies of the same wave the lack on emotional charge and personality, as well as the flat screenplay, may not be missed much. All in all the movie feels like an excuse to show repetitive fight scene flowered with pretty surroundings. However hollow/shallow the movie was made relatively well. And perhaps it does not matter that the British accent was inconsistent with the real thing, and the Russian used by the second ghost girl was so bad that a fluent speaker such as myself could not understand a word of it and had to read the subtitles like everyone else. The most amusing and charming (perhaps the only) aspect of the movie was Lara's sarcastic engineer.  All in all do go and see this movie if you enjoyed the likes of The Mummy and X Men.

191,Psycho Mantis,Angelina Jolie is FANTASTIC!,7,2 January 2002,"Based on the popular video games Tomb Raider, about the adventuress Lara Croft.

Lara gets a good opportunity to finally see her long dead dad again, and tries to find out how the clock works. But evil forces want to lay their hands on the clock as well.Director Simon West has said that if Angelina Jolie wouldn´t had accepted the role as Lara Croft, the movie wouldn´t have been made. This is perfectly understandable, as Angelina Jolie is easily the best thing in ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"". I mean, she IS Lara Croft. I am perfectly honest when I say that I think Jolie deserves another Oscar nomination, because this is the strongest performance by a lady I´ve seen all year. The rest of the cast is, understandably, not as interesting as Lara. So is the plot. Over-complicated and not believable at all, one might think the script was written in an afternoon. The jokes are lame and the drama parts doesn´t convince. The ending is pure rubbish. But in spite of all this the movie is salvaged, thanks to Angelina Jolie and three magnificent action scenes, where Lara fights a robot, a bunch of bad guys breaking into her mansion and finally a group on stone statues.

Naturally this means the plot is pretty much nonsense, but that's ok: the movie is really about the several cool action scenes and star Angela Jolie. Jolie is a perfect Lara: she's tough, athletic, smart and really sexy. Also on the plus side the film has a good, icy villain. The actor who played the wonderfully obnoxious Rimmer from the British sci-fi comedy 'Red Dwarf' also has a small part, but he's wasted - I kept expecting him to do something funny but it was just a straight role. Another negative is that the ending is a disappointment: not only does it not make much sense, but it's seems flat and obvious - the obligatory dangerous obstacle, the obligatory mystical stuff, the obligatory reconcilation scene, the obligatory final fight.

It says something about the idiot quotient of the Tomb Raider movie, when it is the ""dummy"" version of the series of video games upon which it is based, video games that sold millions of copies due primarily to the fact that their heroine has big boobs.  I wasn't surprised to see that this masterpiece of moronics was brought to us by the creative genius's behind quality films such as Death Wish V:  The Face of Death, K-911 (the long-awaited made-for-video sequel to the 1980's ""James Belushi with a funny police dog"" movie, K-9), Casper, Judge Dredd, The Flintstones, Lost in Space (no, not the good version), Con Air, Disney's The Kid, Armageddon, Wing Commander (another big hit based on a video game), My Giant, and that pivotal third entry to the Darkman series, Darkman III:  Die Darkman Die.If the list of films up above gets you excited, you have a lot to look forward to in Tomb Raider.  Bad acting, bad writing, bad cinematography, bad soundtrack, bad jokes and, more than anything, bad directing, it's all here for you!  During the time I was watching this soon-to-be-laughed-at midnight movie, I was unaware that Simon West, the infamously atrocious director behind the dreadful Con Air, was once again allowed to go behind the camera and make a fool out of yet another once respectable leading performer (he did it last time with Nicolas Cage) through lots of ""macho"" gestures and slow motion shots.  I am almost ashamed of myself that I didn't pick out West as the leader of this incredibly guilty cast of goofballs willing to put their names on one of the worst ""event"" movies ever created, after the first replicated Con Air slow motion melt-down.  West seems able to do two things, as a director:  1.  film in slow motion 2. film in slow motion again.Even though I'd like it to, the blame doesn't lie solely on West's shoulders, for this one.  As I mentioned at the start of this review, everything about Tomb Raider is bad.  Really bad.  I realize that I shouldn't have expected much from the script, being that it did come from the writer of Darkman III:  Die Darkman Die (Michael Colleary), but couldn't we at least have had the plot make a little sense?  What are all these little kids doing appearing and disappearing?  Did Scriptware tell Mr. Colleary that he needed to add a few more pages, so he just threw in some meaningless kids?  Instead of watching weird ghost kids running around, for no apparent reason, why couldn't we see a little character resolution, and plot explanation?  What happened to the old guy who betrayed Lord Croft at the beginning of the movie, and felt so extremely bad for doing so?  What was Lord Croft doing in the Illuminati?  What was the bad guy's motivation? Sure, he wanted to control the world, or whatever, but for what reason? Why was his little sidekick guy so devoted to helping his cause? Would he somehow benefit if his evil master controlled time?  I haven't seen this many loose ends since I accidentally walked into the enema ward at the hospital.It is extremely rare that a movie is so bad that it actually makes me angry, but Tomb Raider is that rarity.  The movie is lazy.  It doesn't even try to make sense.  This movie isn't worth your time.  Tomb Raider isn't fun, sitting through it is nearly torture, and I'd recommend doing just about anything this weekend over doing that.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
195,thesuthernman,"After avoiding this movie for years, it made a nice Rainy day watch.",6,20 June 2009,"I'm not a fan of A. Jolie or over hyped action films so the combination of those two factors for ""Tomb Raider"" helped make it easier to avoid watching the movie. Jolie, having done some good work, even though I'm not a fan, is particularly bad in this film but still very watchable. I don't know how she accomplishes that, maybe because she is beautiful? She does an awful lot of posing in this film like in a TV medical drama with models. A lot of hands on hips suspended in time for a few seconds longer than humanly normal. The film as a whole, however, is as good as any male dominated action film of the same budget and era. The sets are very well done, creative and rustic. The action is also fun and creative. The plot is worthy of a hero or heroine in this case. Fun and entertaining movie.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
196,Norway1,Disappointed - even with my very low expectations!,4,2 July 2001,"I guess I should start off by saying I am a big Indiana Jones fan and mostly enjoy James Bond movies - in spite of their usually shoddy storyline.I say that because I would consider Tomb Raider a cross between the two films - at least at first site. It's really much more Bond than Jones, and a less interesting Bond at that.What really hurts this film (IMO) is the story and their catering too much to the young teens.I didn't like the father-daughter thing at all and I would have much preferred not knowing who the bad guy was until the end. The way they did it here there was absolutely no suspense. You pretty much knew exactly what was going to happen from start to finish.That being the case I was hoping for at least some visual candy to keep me interested.Sorry to disappoint you but this version of Lara isn't exactly what fans of the game are expecting. The opening scene is frankly the only one that does her wardrobe justice.The only eye candy this offered was some pretty nice cinematography in landscapes.That being said I think Jolie did an adequate job on her accent (though it was clearly not ""Queens English"" it was better than many other attempts we've suffered through in the past). The action scenes were mostly well played out (with a couple obvious exceptions) and the sets were pretty well designed.Overall there's really not much to see here - that is unless you're under 15.5 out of 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
197,cToTh-2,"S'okay, I suppose.",7,20 June 2001,"I just saw this movie, and it certainly did not meet its hype, as I was expecting.  Even as I decided to see this movie, I did not expect to rate it as a perfect 10 (I gave it a 7).Personally, I'm getting tired of these Hollywood-type movies where the protagonist fights several small armies and comes out of these encounters with little more than a scratch or two.  I prefer the ones where it becomes a ""team"" effort.Not only that, but I had difficulties believing that these ""tomb raiders"" can solve the ""mysteries"" of a tomb in matter of moments, when in reality it may take archaeologists weeks, months or even a year to accomplish the same thing.  I guess they had to speed things up or else we would all fall asleep as they deciphered runes, etc.In any case, Angelina gave us one hell of a show (also, it doesn't hurt that she's easy on the eyes).  According to reports I heard on the television, she had undergone extensive training for this part and performed many of her own stunts.  Kudos, Angelina, kudos.All in all, it was a nice little adventure, and I imagine I will purchase it when released on video.Personally, I still prefer the Indiana Jones movies.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
198,eternalsea,Sexy and stylish fun.,6,2 April 2006,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider may be the silliest movie to ever grace multiplex screens, but it may well be one of the most enjoyable to. The action is thick fast and stylish, the stunts so unbelievable you'll love them and little pieces of Angelina Jolie thrown in for good measure. The story is a B movie classic, Tomb Raider Lara Croft finds a clock that contains a powerful map. The map shows the way to the pieces of an artifact that if placed together when a planetary allignment occurs grants the bearer the power of God. However the evil group the Illumenati want the map for themselves and thus steal it from Lara. Lara then goes after the group in order to stop them from using it for evil. The acting is the campest of the year with Iain Glenn as the stand out. Jolie is the perfect person to play Lara and looks great in some of the action sequences. The supporting cast which includes Daniel Craig are very much background players but they add plenty of color and fun to the story. The Director Simon West, who is also responsible for the excellent Con Air deserves applause for catching the essence of the Video game perfectly. So sit back and relax because when it comes to Lara Croft Tomb Raider only a churl won't love it.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
199,killbill_28,Slow Story,5,21 May 2006,"When you really think about it, this movie isn't that bad. The action in the movie is great and well set out, its the slow story line the killed this movie. Even though that the movie starts off fast with lots of action it soon drags on as the story gets into the picture. Simon West directed this movie, he tried to make it good with lots of action, with a bit of comedy added in, but he slowed down the pace of the film when the main plot comes in. (Its a very long 93 minutes).The reason this film didn't get the box office hit it was meant to get is because of the films slow pace and story line. That's why the writers of this film didn't return to write Tomb Raider 2. And even though that Simon West put great action scenes in the film, he slowed down the story with his directing. Simon West has made great films like Con Air but this movie wasn't his best. I rate this a 5 out of 10, this is for having a great start, lots of action and great finish. But it loses stars for having a slow story line.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
200,ferreira0665,A Fun Movie,8,20 June 2001,"Now alot of people have chosen to not like this movie for reasons of major plotholes and other things.  This movie is entertaining if you look at it as entertaining and don't critique every single thing that doesn't fit reality. Lara Croft is basically a female Indiana Jones.  I like the movie.  Most of it was ridiculous but there are a lot of movies out there that are supposed to be taken seriously and is plain stupid.  Independence Day was one.  It was way too ridiculous.  Tomb Raider is meant to be taken as an entertaining fun movie and that is as far as you are supposed to go.  You are not supposed to critique it.  I laughed more than anything else when I saw this movie. The +'s on the movie are the following:  Beautiful actress to play the lead character, Daniel Craig played his part well as Alex West, and the Powell guy was a decent actor also.  Everybody else was mediocre, but then again they aren't the ones who are supposed to lead the movie anyway.  The Soundtrack and Special Effects were awesome too.Now the -'s are there was plotholes but who cares, it is basically a damn video game.  When has a video game had a decent realistic storyline.  I mean, think honestly.  Another bad thing was all these new characters coming out of nowhere.  Who the hell is Mr. Pimms, the Powell guy, Alex West, and the doctor.  These people were never mentioned.  They said Larson was in the movie but I didn't know who he was.  They should have used the other characters from the game like, Pierre, Larson being a bit bigger role, Jacqueline Natla, Von Croy, The Russian Guy in Tomb Raider Chronicles and probably the characters from Tomb Raider 2 through 3.  Another thing is what happened to the killing of the animals, not saying that I would like to see animals killed, but that was a bit part of the game at least the first one.But, all in all I give this movie an 8 because it did entertain me for what it was.  Slow in some areas but not too slow.  You should at least see it once and don't take it seriously at all when you do or you will ruin the experience.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
201,hokiemo,"Lara Croft is Action, Beauty and Brains",8,24 January 2006,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider is enjoyable camp. All the parts are clichéd such as her evil nemesis, Manfred Powell, her ever dependable butler Hillary, and Wilson, the old man she seeks wisdom from and then betrays her. The story is about a group called the Illuminata who are looking for the 2 halves of a triangle which when joined and after following a series of steps, gives the holder the power to control time and space like God, putting the stability of the entire universe at risk. The plot and action scenes reminded me of a video game and I didn't mind it one bit. Jolie poses in various monochromatic outfits and pouts her famous lips a lot but I think this will one day secure it as a cult classic. The film is if anything, gorgeous to watch, moves quickly, and has an excellent lead player. Finally a film that knows 100 minutes is enough time to play itself out. Jolie brings a depth to the role of Lara Croft that many other actresses would have fallen flat with. And the stunts were fantastic; I was surprised during the bonus footage to find out Jolie did all of her own stunts. She's not only fit, she's brave. The stunts look difficult because they are. I thought the scene where she is being chased out a tomb by water was computer animated, but it wasn't.Overall, the film is true to its inspiration.

This movie is good but seriously had to work on the graphics. I mean the stupidity of all the action movies in Hollywood is that they mostly show lame and unrealistic scenes, especially which has a connection with reality for example there's a scene where Lara's jumping with a high a rope in her house with the night suit on and there's about a fleet of shooters shooting at her .. and she's like dancing along with the rope and dodging the bullets. Lara Croft is an archeologist agreed but she's a human with ammunition not a superhero just like Batman .. with cool gadgets and a halloween costume 😂 . So they seriously need to check on the storyboards hence they make a scene which becomes more of a joke rather than something likeable .. plus this movie has tons of mistakes so it comes to 6 as a rating .

I'm still waiting for a story line to develop, and the movie ended about 10 hours ago.

205,ShannonAmidala,Wonderfully cast action-packed movie,7,15 June 2001,"I saw this movie tonight, on opening night. The theater wasn't as packed as I was expecting, but maybe that's a good thing. ;) I liked how this movie started out- fast, drawing us in quickly, making us savor every moment. Angelina Jolie portrayed Lara Croft wonderfully. Simon West's casting of her was absolutely perfect. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the video-game vixen nearly as well as she. The action in this movie was phenomenal. Quick, swift camera movements that didn't make me overly dizzy or reaching for my drink. It had just the right amount of weapons and sexual fervor to give chills to the audience and keep their eyes glued to the screen. Speaking of sexual fervor, the movie is filled with it, but it wasn't as revealing as I had perceived. I thought that Angelina would be stripping this way and that, very obviously (e.g. think Charlie's Angels). Instead, they played her upon her beauty in a very smart way, I believe. It wasn't so much how beautiful she was; it was what she said, how she said it, how she carried herself, what she did. That essence is what made the movie great. It's what made us care for Lara Croft. The plot, on the other hand, I didn't care for as much. Slightly tedious and confusing at times, it didn't interest me as much as the action movements and scenes. All in all, a very good achievement on Simon West's part, and, not to mention, Angelina Jolie and her father, Jon Voight. :) I give it a 7 out of 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

However you most certainly WILL...sneer at Lara Croft's apparent immortality and stare in disbelief as yet more cgi statues come to life only to be shattered into little pieces. You'll tell your friends that there's no need to pause the film when you visit the toilet and you'll wonder why you didn't watch an Indiana Jones movie, or at least 'The Mummy.'I enjoy mindless action films as long as they're done with a sense of style - this is just flat.

207,alafolle,A picturesque train wreck of a movie,4,17 April 2002,"Beautiful, lavishly constructed sets.  An energetic and charming lead actress.  Creative special effects.  But somehow the whole production goes down in flames, writhing and screaming.Simon West appears to be the sort of director who will hire a crack team of programmers to model and develop a whiz-bang expensive CGI monster, painstakingly detailed down to the color of its toenails, and then grant the monster 1.5 seconds of screen time, during which it is moving too damn fast for the viewer to actually see it.  The movie is visually impressive, but the pacing is so terrible that we don't have a chance to enjoy it.  It's a character-driven action movie, but we don't get to know the characters, and the action is rammed down our throats so hard that we don't get to savor it.I propose a new Hollywood Production Code.  All directors of future ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" rip-offs shall be forced to study the aforementioned movie and take notes on the lost art of building suspense.Angelina Jolie deserves praise for throwing herself gamely into this physically demanding role and carrying herself like a Grade-A movie star. The rest of the actors are barely noticeable... only one or two characters seem to have identifiable purposes in life other than to battle animated monsters.  The two most memorable characters other than Lara Croft herself are Ms. Jolie's horrifyingly massive CGI breasts, which deliver a nuanced performance by subtly waxing and waning in size during the course of the action, and by moving in a gravity-and-logic-defying manner relative to the rest of the actress.Overall, ""Tomb Raider"" scores only two boobs out of a possible five.

This is a new breed of movie - so bad, so atrocious, so needlessly loud, so offensive and so grotesquely a vigorously insulting parody of what a movie can be that it could have only have been made by a person who hates and despises both the audience and the whole experience of going to the movies. This is the sort of movie that makes Elizabeth Berkley weep tears of relief; no-one will ever, in his wildest dreams, think of ""Showgirls"" as the worst movie in the world any more.

What makes this movie so weak is the fact that Lara seems to beat everyone to the punch.  I mean she has every thing handed to her in the first few seconds. The only real good thing is that Angelina Plays the part real we'll if you have ever played the game it's a perfect fit ,but just at the beggining of the film it just goes way to fast and get's really cheesy in the beggininng and the get's a little better when Lara actually start traveling and fighting ,but she just in there beacuse she looks good and I guess that's all  you need.

The first time i saw this i thought it was awful but all my friends were telling me that they loved it so being the sheep that i was (and just wanting to fit in) i went to see it again.I wanted to like it, i really did. But like Mission: Impossible 2 and Alien Resurrection i found it difficult to watch. My philosophy is that all computer adaptations are terrible and to this day i have been right. i shouldv'e listened to my own advise when going to see this movie, in fact i shouldn't have even bought the ticket but i saw it anyway.I think the main reason that alot of my friends liked this film was because it starred Angelina Jolie and it had a scene with her in the shower. Although titilation can be appealing it DOES NOT make a movie.
To its credit Simon West (director) does know how keep the addrenaline junkies happy. This film does have some impressive action sequences that keep you on your toes. But like many other plain old action movies this doesn't detract from the fact that this is just a popcorn blockbuster that is there to bring in the cash.And like The Mummy Returns it feels rushed. This is a film that had to meet a short deadline and that is why it looks so messy. By the time the credits role you will think that there was alot more that could have been done to make the movie better if they had the time to do it.In the end i don't want to slag this movie off too much as there are certain bits that i liked.

While the plot is quite sound and fits in with the history of the character very nicely, the action is missing and when it does arrive, it provides no excitement at all.  There is no tension, no adrenaline, nothing.  The other major problem is the script.  The dialogue in the games is of a higher quality than this dross.  Plot development was poorly done, characters flimsily constructed and the major confrontations between the major characters had all the bite of a dead slug.Given the material, Jolie is okay and Iain Glen makes an adequate baddie.

Sadly one of those films is not 'Lara Croft Tomb Raider'. I presonally believe that these attempts to bring video games to life on the big screen is nothing more than an excuse for producers to cash in on the popular franchise that they are.They seem to believe that all an audience of teenagers need to be satisfied is some flashy visual effects. Some gratuitous action sequences and daft throw away lines. Does any of these producers ever think of giving these movies a half decent script. One with and heres a novel idea, a story.One has to wonder why Angelina Jolie bothered to do this project. Her performance in the movie is admirable considering the limp dialogue she has has to spout. The performances generally aren't half bad. Iain Glen as the chief villain is suitably smarmy and oily while Jolies real life father the great Jon Voight makes a cameo as her, would you credit it, father. His brief performance only lifts the movie from the doldrums for a minute or two. His as well as Jolies accents are convincing.It's also nice to see Chris Barrie from 'Red Dwarf' fame make an apearence as Laras butler Hilary. His performance isn't exactly outstanding. His mannerisms remind me to much of the Hologramatic character of Rimmer he played in 'Red Dwarf. Stillit's nice to see him in a big screen roll. Shame it wasn't something better than this tripe.Noah Taylor is given a leaden roll as Lara's possible love interest. This doesn't seem to really come to fruition and is left up in the air. Much like much of the plot.The story as it itself is muddled and confusing. Something to do with a sacred kind of clock that every so many thousnds of years can be used to travel through time and is here used blatantly as a dire plot device that sees Lara talking to her father and saving her would be love interest. This too is downright baffling. Plus there is Laras conversations with a little girl that are never explained.The action sequences themselves though well done stretch credability to the max. They too are rare and don't come along often enogh making it downright slow at times. By the end of the movie you will need to carried out in a sleeping bag.If iI had to decribe Lara Croft in one sentence it would be as a very poor attempt at a modern day 'Raider of the Lost Ark' with a feminist twist. Indiana Jones would almost certainly be turning in his grave.Rating: * (Terrible)",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
216,tony-clifton,Better the second time around,7,29 April 2003,"When I first watches this movie, I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy it.  It could be just that I was in the wrong mood.  However, I did find the movie lacking a convincing villain challenging enough to make you root for the heroine.  Indiana Jones had a good villain, Jackie Chan movies always pit him against the odds - that's what makes for good action.  In Tomb Raider, not only is it clear to everyone that Lara Croft is greater than the villains by a long shot, worse still - she joins forces with them!  This creates a confusing scenario where natural sympathies for the main character get thrown out the window.However when I watched it the second time, this time without any preconceived notions and fully expecting the lack of exciting odds, I really enjoyed it for what it is - a visually appealing film with some thrilling stunts and action scenes.  The fact that Angelina did her own stunts adds to the enjoyability of the key action scenes, all of which are artfully conceived and executed.I realize many people toast this movie, but watch the movie for what it offers - some unique and stylish action.  The heroine certainly does some nifty tricks that we've never seen on the big screen before, let alone from a female character.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
217,Psyche-8,Visual feast but very disappointing over all,2,27 December 2004,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Having been a fan of the games for years and upon hearing the news that they had cast Angelina Jolie in the lead role  who in my opinion looks exactly like Lara Croft - I was definitely looking forward to seeing a live action adaptation.The only thing I can say is, how disappointing! What happened? I was under the impression that a movie required a plot! Even the games had better, more interesting and more developed plots than this film did! I feel that the big failing of this film is that, with the possible exception of Lara, I didn't care about any of the characters. The villain wasn't particularly villainous, his accomplice (Daniel Craig) wasn't particularly accomplished  and Craig's character's whole history / flirtation with Lara was poorly done, irritating and not the slightest bit believable. Moreover, the sole purpose of the annoying and nerdish Bryce and the toothless Hillary seemed to be that of worshippers - doing everything short of exclaiming ""Look how great and wonderful and brilliant the magnificent Lara Croft is"" whenever they're on screen. (And they really needn't have bothered, since the movie contains more than enough lingering, Lara-worship camera angles!) My main issue with this movie is how much Lara's self-confidence and self-assurance seems to constantly verge on arrogance. Keeping people at arm's length is one thing, looking down your nose at everyone around you is another. Jolie's portrayal of Lara's confidence in her own abilities comes across as smugness. The hints of Lara's vulnerability when it comes to the memory of her late father, sit uncomfortably next to Lara's complacency during the majority of the film. As a woman myself, I'm all for seeing the portrayal of confident female characters on screen. Yet I feel that Lara's self-possession should have been played down and more attention should have been paid to her insecurities and vulnerable side. This would have rendered Lara more believable and more endearing to an audience.The overall problem with the movie is that it doesn't engage with the audience. The plot seems to be something of a secret between Lara and her father, and the audience feel left out of the loop which is very frustrating to the viewer. Too wrapped up in ancient history, legend, magic, foreign cultures and traditions, and populated by ""I-know-something-you-don't-know"" characters, the film is rendered virtually inaccessible to an audience.Visually stunning, but otherwise a real let-down.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

You see its not the directors fault or the actors. I must admit Agelina Jolie is the perfect Lara Croft. Its the writers fault. The script just fell through, a movie with such a budget just gets swept under with a lousy script. Good special effects though, but thats about it.

This movie is absolutely horrible, in terms of the stuck up performance of Angelina Jolie. Her snobbishness and over confidence makes this performance extremely annoying and hard to bare. What's worse is the plot of destroying two triangle pieces that can control time. Why didn't the people who hid the pieces all those years ago destroy it themselves? The music is not suitable for the tone of the film, making it feel more like some sort of rock concert rather than an expedition of a female archaeologist about to save the world. I just felt that superheroes actually have emotions too rather than just umlimited amount of energy.The sequel is better, but the story is pretty much the same.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Of course we already knew ""Tomb Rider"" series from the video games in the late 90's, early 00's, and I was positively surprised by these whole film. It's empowering to woman, has a well structured storyline and a high quality production. The story was written in a believable way and the fact that the action took part in inumerous locations made all more interesting, enjoyable, cultural and fun.
Director Simon West did a wonderful job casting Angelina Jolie. She was the perfect choice to interpret Lara, because miss Croft is well known for her beauty and, simultaneously, strength, both physical and mental, as well as courage, individualism, confidence and the capability to achieve her objectives. John Voight as the character father was a spicey add to the mix, because, of course, he's Jolie's real father. Lady Croft is a female hero, a role model and an achiever, a winner, an inspiration and a motivation, and she's the person who can save the Earth. Over all we also saw a brilliant performance by Daniel Craig. This is, undoubtedly, one of the best based on a video-game movie of the 00's decade.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
222,freakezette,"Angelina's Great, but that's about it",6,21 November 2001,"Now that the summer season's over, I can look back and say that Summer 2001 was full of High Hopes and Short Comings. Nearly every movie fell short of expectations, and Tomb Raider was no exception.I can't blame them for trying to put out a Tomb Raider movie, video game movies are, I think, the most difficult adaption to pull off. The handful of video game movies that have been made gained a cult following at best and may show late at night on cable TV, but other than that haven't done too well. 2001's other video game movie, Final Fantasy, fell wildly short of expectations despite the great reputation of the Final Fantasy Games. In that respect, Tombraider may be the best video game movie ever at this point, but it still falls short of being a good movie.Like so many summer flicks, Tomb Raider is all eye-candy, but no substance. It had a wide variety of locals, good special effects, and Angelina Jolie as a pitch perfect Lara Croft. But the story's too simple, the supporting characters are too cardboard, and you feel you might as well have spent your two hours playing the game.If you like Angelina, you'll at least be able to watch this film, otherwise, wait till it's on TNT after Street Fighter or something.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Although I don't really like the video game, I thought (and still think) that you could do a great film about the heroine. A reasonable plot is of course necessary... And this is one of the points where this movie is completely lost. A revenge story? Oh, please... And then, there is the editing! While everybody says that M:I 2 sucks because of slow motion, this one lacks it. Everything is too fast. The sequences are incredible (I think so...) if you could actually SEE them. But this is only shooting here, explosion there, running everywhere... And the ending... this ""mano a mano without weapons"" thing ... I nearly left the cinema. Plot holes, plot holes and breasts that change size within seconds. Jolie looks okay, the bad guy is ugly, the ""hero"" is ugly, too. Voight is kind of uninteresting.3 out of 10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
224,stevenleadbetter,"She climbs, swings and shoots. Now she is real.",7,7 November 2001,"I really wanted to hate this film. I loved the game. Part of me didn't want this film to be any good because I didn't want the good name of gaming be sullied by movie madness. I didn't want anything to take away from the gaming experience I had had. Lara was personal from a long time ago and the masses really didn't deserve her. So I hoped people would deride the movie and keep Lara firmly on the small screen, where she could be properly appreciated. The sets in this picture are truly astonishing and capture the spirit of Tomb Raider excellently. Hardened TR fans cannot complain that every effort hasn't been put into making this as close to the original as possible. Angelina Jolie makes an excellent Lara Croft with a credible English accent. Chris Barrie plays a likeable butler. The plot zips along at a pace and it needs to be fairly simple to accommodate this, which it is, in fairness. The SFX are not groundbreaking with a scene reminiscent of 'The Mummy' to name but one of the few all-action sequences, but they thrill, nonetheless. A fantastic Indiana Jones-athon, almost worthy of the name.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
225,Jigglypoof,No man (or woman) is an island.,7,20 June 2001,"What immediately struck me is how reminiscent this film is of the Mortal Kombat pair of films (of course I might be a little biased given I was a fan of the games and the movies).  Not to mention that they couldn't have picked anyone better than Angelina Jolie for the part of Lara (or her father as Lara's father!). 
  I am not a fan of the Tomb Raider series of video games... but I eagerly anticipated this film.  But this may be why I may not know what I'm talking about when I say that the character cannot be exactly as she is in the video games... but I believe that would get repetitive quickly. 
  I didn't expect anything else... and the story was better than I was led to believe.  It's exactly what it's supposed to be.    On a final note, even as a woman, I can acknowledge when another woman is hot.  And she is.  Let's hope the sequels turn out just as good.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

However, you'd never guess she's a good actress from this movie. All characters are totally flat, including her, and there's not a single interesting person in it. I think that's the main difference to Indiana Jones. The characters are also types there but Harrison Ford manages to give him a human touch. So I think this film is basically about action and special effects and this is where it does well. However, in the end the film is not half as exciting and convincing as Raiders of the Lost Arc or a James Bond film.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
227,james.p.taylor,Oh boy.,5,17 July 2001,"I'll start by saying I'm not a big fan of the game, so I don't have the obsessive point of view some people seem to have when Lara Croft is mentioned.Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a member of the British nobility, big house and butler included.  She keeps herself entertained by raiding tombs in search of lost treasures.Its the time of a total planetary alignment when a lost treasure will give its possessors the power over time.  To find this treasure a key is needed. No prizes for guessing who has this key.What follows on from this is about 90 minutes of head scratching as you try to figure out what cliche is going to be thrown at you next.  Sara B. Coopers script, even for an action film, is weak.The main problem I saw was that Lara can handle every situation, so it lacks the tension of 'will she/won't she make it?'.  Jolie, an Oscar winner, is given a script that doesn't do justice to her acting ability.Now mix in cartoon baddies and you have a money spinner.Simon West's direction is all over the place.  Moments that could do with a little calm are packed to the gills with gun fights and explosions, a trick he better employed in Con Air.  The actors are left to struggle against this and the script.Tight editing does pull it back slightly, but this isn't good.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Even the fight scenes were boring. My date fell asleep, and by the end of the movie I wished I had as well. Even worse, Super Mario Brothers was on TV the next day, and I found myself realizing that Tomb Raider was even worse than that.

By June, I had played at least one demo of each game, had every picture off the internet and put about three hundred sites on Tomb Raider and Lara Croft in my Favourites list. Now I own every game plus the gold versions.  I was ecstatic when I found out about the movie, and needed to know everything about it. My sisters and I went to see ""Bring It On"" and they had a trailer for it, and I only remembered the trailer not anything about the actual movie I saw.  I won advanced screening tickets to Tomb Raider, and although I was mildly disappointed that it wasn't as action packed as the trailer made it out to be, I still loved it.  I like the fact that they incorporated Lara Croft's emotional side into the movie, which is something that you don't see in the games, and they gave her a development throughout the film - she went from being a very cold closed off person to being a warm open one, etc. etc.  This movie has a killer soundtrack (especially Terra Firma by Delerium) and it is definitely worth a watch. I give it 10/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
231,BaiNst,How much can I get paid to write a good review of this film?,3,9 August 2001,"The reviewer Michael G. Sibley is an obvious studio flunky. I'vetaken the liberty of correcting his review:Summer has opened with a pitiful whimper with one of the mostanticipated action films of the year: ""Tomb Raider."" Trained forcombat by the most elite warriors (not that we ever see or hear ofsuch training...so her prowse in combat is really a mystery to theviewer), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider explodes into theaters todisappoint audiences of all ages.Hollywood is still looking for its newest action star, because thename Angelina Jolie certainly isn't fitting the bill...at least not asdisplayed in this film. Jolie would be the perfect choice to carry thetorch as newest action star if it weren't for the fact that her spindlyarms make one wonder how she's able to lift a fork to her mouth,let alone fire two pistols at once. Watching Jolie utilize her beauty,style and attitude was nothing short of frustrating, because eventhough there was a shower scene, they never panned down belowher shoulders. While she may have already made a name forherself in previous films, ""Tomb Raider"" will be the film that putsJolie on the road to mediocrity, and more bad movies. Furthermore, although Jolie has revealed her skills as an actionstar with style and attitude, and her accent wasn't *horrible*, shestill can't save a boring plot, poor script, or floundering direction.Jolie was not the only reason ""Tomb Raider"" sucked. In order tocreate the worst film, all the pieces must be in place. One piece ofthis puzzle is the supporting cast; for ""Tomb Raider"" the directormade perfect selections when he chose group of unknown buttalented actors that included Iain Glenn, Daniel Craig, Noah Taylorand Mark Collie. These are among the most unmemorable actorsI've had the stomach to watch. As with Jolie, it was through no faultof their own, but even if they all pulled off the greatestperformances of their careers, it couldn't save the lame plot,unfocused script, and painful-to-sit-through editting.Credibility and awe were among the last thoughts that came tomind when I saw Jon Voight appear on screen...the first being""Who is that guy? Didn't he used to be famous?"". The casting ofJon Voight as Lord Richard Croft, Lara's father, didn't add a singlething to the movie, especially considering that  Jolie and Voightshare only a single scene together. When an established legendlike Voight stars in a film, one can always bet on the success ofthat movie, but one will certainly lose that bet every time...who canforget the credibility and success that Sean Connery brought to""Highlander 2: The Quickening""...now that's film making at itsfinest!From the unexpected shallowness of the story to the well-choreographed-yet-poorly-displayed action sequences,""Tomb Raider"" will make viewers part from the movie. Credit mustbe given to the writers for creating an atmosphere where viewersare able to squirm in their seats, check their good-taste at the doorand laugh at (not with) the movie. I was disappointedly surprisedto learn that ""Tomb Raider"" was actually poorer and more shallowin character than it was with story. For example, I was mesmerizedby how the writers completely skipped over developing thepersonality for Lara Croft, because there is nothing worse thanwatching a cardboard cutout action hero or heroine with thecharacter motivation of a fern.When you combine the charm and charisma of James Bond withthe style of Ethan Hunt, the result is definitely not Lara Croft: TombRaider. If she used gadgets, fast vehicles and a no nonsenseattitude, Lara Croft would be cool...but instead she punishes heraudience with an insulting lack of logic (pick up a gun, why don'tyou?). The children in ""Spy Kids"" were more adept than Lara Croft.Watching Lara Croft in action and ""Tomb Raider"" in theaters willwet the appetites of everyone who want to see James Bond andEthan Hunt, because you'll need something to cleanse the badtaste from your brain.With Hindu statues that come to life and fight their foes to thebeautiful, exotic scenery surrounding the cast, one would expect""Tomb Raider"" to be one of the most visually entertaining films ofthe year; but the trite set designs and poorly crafted actionsequences will leave you in yawns. I can't recall the last time amovie was so skillfully put together and well thought out than""Tomb Raider."" Oh...wait a second, yes I can. ""Momento""...nowthere's some skill and thought, buddy. But if we're just talkingaction films, then ""Tomb Raider"" is still a far cry from even themost average of action films, like ""Sudden Death"" or ""A Better WayTo Die"". Viewers will leave the movie with smiles because theycan't believe Hollywood has done it to them again: took the moneyand run. When you invade this tomb, you will be buried alive...andthankful that the air will soon be crushed out of you, and you won'thave to bare the continued viewing of the flick.Another reviewer summed it up perfectly: ""The dialouge:awful,thescript:awful,the story:awful,and the acting,awful.And to behonest,even the special effects are below average.The story thataccompanies it,meanwhile,is little more than an Indiana Jonesrip-off ,all the worst elements crammed into a story with nopace,style or substance whatsoever.""Thanks, Hollywood.

234,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,So bad it's actually pretty good.,5,25 July 2001,"I went in expecting very little from this movie. Almost nothing in fact, partly because I don't care for videogame movies in the first place (videogames are essentially about interactivity, that's why they, in my opinion, don't translate to the silver screen), partly because I, even in my gaming days, never played a Tomb Raider game and partly because I'm not too big an Angelina Jolie-fan. I mean, what has she really done, besides knives and Billy Bob Thornton? Gia I didn't like, Girl Interrupted I never saw and the less said about Gone in 60 Seconds, the better. Well, after seeing this, I must say, most of my expectations were met.Worst of all is the script, which seems satisfied by just showing iconic Lara Croft in various positions. It's basically four set-pieces tied together in some way that not even the most ardent fan can call a story. Tick off your cliches from two handed gunfiring (more reminiscent of The Matrix than John Woo's work, by the way), the so-called comedy side-kicks, the one-dimensional villains and so much more. And the plot; please don't even get me started. Then there's the dialogue. Most of the one-liners completely missed target and especially everything Lord Croft (Jon Voight; poor, poor man) said could have been bettered by a monkey. Seriously. Of course Lara Croft is one of the nineties' definitive popculture icons, but does that justify making such a mess of the script? I don't think so. Then there's the endless list of cinematic errors. Best example: the final fight scene, once again filmed in short takes and predictable angles. Post-The Matrix, this is a poor excuse for movie action.Angelina Jolie does very little acting here. She does do a lot of winking, shooting, jumping, wearing cool clothes and showering, though. So if that's your bag (and to be honest, it is my bag), it does work very well for a time. It's just that, Jolie is more of a icon-made-flesh than an actual character.Indeed, judged as a real movie, this is every bit as bad as The Mummy Returns and Pearl Harbor. But I did enjoy it a lot more. Generally, I don't buy the idea of movies so bad they're actually rather good, but in this case it's my only explanation. I didn't laugh once when I was supposed to, no, but I did laugh (Jon Voight: great, great man). I dug the adrenalin fuelled soundtrack, although that (and bad editing) made the set-pieces uninvolving, stand-alone music videos. And discovering plot holes as huge as Angkor Wat while watching proves genuinely amusing. Still, this would be nothing if not for the sheer ridiculousness of it all. Stone Monkeys? Time travelling? Lara and villain running up that piramid? And the kid that pops up from time to time? What is this ?!!???!The answer I can give is: Hilarious. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is not by any means a good film and it didn't even change my opinion on videogame flicks or Angelina Jolie slightly.

One more time she proved that she's one of the best actresses and that she can play every kind of role(crazy girl in GIRL INTERRUPTED, narko-lesbian in GIA, heroin in TOMB RAIDER, and a simple drama role in THE SIN). And she also proved that she's very hot. The movie itself looks like another INDIANA JONES but basically it's based on the videogame.

I won't go as far as saying this was a bad film, it's just that I found the storyline to be predictably convoluted (memories of ""X-men""). There were of course, the obligatory big explosions, gun fights, Samurai type fight sequences one would expect, but it all seemed to have been done so many times before, giving me the impression that the film was a lot longer than it actually was.I was also hoping for a lot more humour than was delivered. In fact I found the whole experience to be somewhat by the numbers. It was very hard to feel any real sympathy for the characters in this film. Ok, I know it's only meant to be a bit of escapist fun, but I can't help but feel that the producers knew they were on to a winner anyway, and didn't bother to put any real effort into breathing life into the character of 'Lara'. A bit disappointing really, given the hype that preceded this film.Despite the shallow script, for me there's no doubting that Angelina Jolie made the perfect 'Lara Croft'. I tried hard to think of another young actress who could play the part any better - but I don't think anyone else could.

I, for one, didn't think the movie was that bad. Then again, I happen to own Simon West's 2 previous attempts at film making, Con Air and The General's Daughter. Angelina Jolie was very realistic in her portrayal of Lara Croft. I went to see the movie with my six year old son, and he thought it was a hoot. We own most of the games, so for him it was like a big real life video game. I just went to see Angie. She was beautiful, as always. The sets were amazing. I dont think Eidos knew what they had when they started this series. I see quite a few more of these movies being made if it grosses what I think it will this weekend.

243,schaefer.oliver,What an unbelievable bulls***,2,2 July 2001,"This was surely the worst movie I`ve seen so far this year. No story, lame sets, bad visual effects, bad acting and Simon West has proved, that he may be good at commercials, but has no sense of making a decent movie.His first film ""Con Air"" was a dumb movie and ""The general´s daughter"" was based on a fantastic novel by Nelson De Mille and a screenplay by William Goldman, so this one needed no direction. Nobody could have made that a bad film. ""Tomb Raider"" is clearly an expensive C-picture and the only good thing in it is Angelina Jolie, who is extremely talented. She was also the reason not to leave the cinema during the film. After ten minutes I thought that this movie must be the unofficial sequel to another clunker ""The Avengers"", which had the same problems. The whole atmosphere of the movie was very sterile. The story was paper thin, which is something I didn´t care about when everything else is ok, but that wasn´t the case here. The sets were so-so and the visual effects reminded me of the effects in David Lynch´s ""Dune"", but that movie was made in 1984! What is shocking about this is the fact, that the FX were made by Mill Film and Cinesite who also made the FX of ""Gladiator"" and ""Event horizon"". The editing was also bad and I asked myself if it could be true, that editor Glen Scantlebury was involved in the elegant editing of ""Bram Stoker´s Dracula"" or if he edited this one in his sleep. And what about the score by Graeme Revell? A movie of this scope for me requires a big score, something like John Williams´""Indiana Jones""-Scores, but no electronic mishmash meandering along through my ears. The big weekly downturn at the boxoffice seems to indicate bad word of mouth and that´s what this movie deserves. Ok, here we are with a big nothing, filled with unbelievable bulls***.

Fair enough, but perhaps I can prevent another soul from my same fate.Safe to say that Ms. Jolie runs around in various color leotards (mostly black), and bulges in all the right places. She whips up on at least a platoon strength commando unit, while expending only fifty thousand rounds of pistol fire. She looked fit and for an up scale Jane Fonda fitness video with explosions and a trillion rounds of machine gun fire, it might have been ok, but for a major motion picture????  Eighty million dollars of ""major"" at that...well.I know this was designed for the folks who are nutty about the video game, but is that what we can expect in the future, videos turned feature movies? It is a lame movie and save your money, but there was one sort of interesting scene. Ms Jolie has a ""full fire"" encounter with some sort of robotic creature. I felt that it, the robot thing, would eventually play a part in the movie, but it didn't. Then there is this computer nerd that I felt had promise as perhaps some sort of alter ego character, but he didn't do squat either. There is one other interesting thing and that is the demographic of folks who ""loved the movie"". Using IMBD's own numbers it seems young girls and women over 45 where the biggest fans, go figure.

246,joshreeves01,This movie was really good,10,14 November 2001,I wish i would have seen this in the theater because it was a good action movie. It was very fast paced and Angelina Jolie was perfect for her role. The movie never lets you down for an hour and a half and will keep your attention.,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
247,Roger-81,Great special effects,8,9 July 2001,"I saw some harsh criticism of this movie and don't quite understand it. I mean this is a movie made from a video game and a character Lara Croft.  I thought Angelina Jolie brought Lara Croft to life and the sets and the backdrops brought the sets in the game to life and gave it such a new dimension.  I liked the movie, it's not like this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I thought they did a good job of scenery, acting, special effects--it was what I expected.  Its very visually impressive. Angelina plays Lara Croft as I would expect her to be cool, low key, you don't really get to know that much about her because she is a pretty mysterious person.  Good job.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
248,humpback,"please, Noooooooo !",4,1 July 2001,"As for starters, I DO like action movies per se, and I am not partial to female leads in action movies - then again, Tomb Raider makes me want to rescind that... Saw it yesterday and still wish I could get a refund, even after a couple of beers and a good night's sleep.... Tomb Raider has a pathetic( ""weak"" would be a compliment !) plot, an even more pathetic villain, extremely uninteresting sidekicks ( both good and bad ones) except for a butler named ""Hillary"", which, by the way, is one of the few intended working laughs in this movie. The rest of the jokes were either unintentional or backfired miserably. As for Miss Croft, ahem Miss Jolie, she makes me wish they had simply put in the animation from the Video Game instead of hiring her for the part, the CGI animation would likely have put up a better acting performance, been cheaper and might have projected more charisma if not for miss Jolie's, admittedly attractive, looks. Oh yes, the setting/backgrounds were nice, as was most of the camerawork, but pretty pictures alone do not a good movie make. The dialogues are beyond trite, lame and not funny and all, and most jarring for an action movie, there are a coupe of overly long and intensely sentimental scenes regarding Lara and her father. Lets be honest, if Tomb Raider would not have had a massive amount of PR hype and high expectations running on it, it would not have made the screen, except as a ""B"" category release, or sunk soundlessly in the second week it was shown. Well, as a major Video Game spin off, we are likely to suffer a second and third part.....Ouch !",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
249,pmoney13,Might have been good...,2,16 June 2001,"if it weren't so damn boring. Here are a few questions that I must ask about this movie. These are questions about moments in the movie that left me perplexed, so if you can answer them, please do: *spoiler alert* *spoilers* *lots and lots of spoilers*1. Near the end, when the bad guy is lying on the ground, a knife in his shoulder, dangling Ms. Croft's beloved locket in front of him and taunting her, why doesn't she just shoot the guy in the head and take the locket, thus avoiding the inevitable and tiresome fight scene?2. Who was the old guy who mumbled ""please forgive me"" while looking at a picture of Lara's father? Wait, better question: What was his motivation for screwing her over? 3. Was the fellow tomb raider a hero or a villain? In a classic case of poor character development, there is no way to tell if this man is good or bad. First, Lara writes ""traitor"" on his shower stall, then at the end he's a love interest. Somebody please explain this. 4. Why did this movie consist of dubious homages (or, more likely, rip-offs) of older, better films? I saw awful references to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""The Fugitive"", and ""The Matrix"", just to name a few. 5. Why was it necessary to have Jon Voight in league with the Illuminatis (or whatever the hell they were called)? Couldn't he have just been their foe, a fellow tomb raider whom they all wanted killed? This would make it unnecessary for them to include a dumb betrayal twist.
6. Why does Lara Croft like to suspend herself from the ceiling of her mansion from wires just before she goes to bed? Doesn't her butler consider this a bit odd? There is no rational explanation for this ever in the movie, and the only reason I can think of is so there is an excuse for her to do some acrobatic stunts when the bad guys come flying through the windows.
and finally...7. Why is this movie so BORING??? It's an action movie, for god's sake. It could have at least been done with some pizazz or a little more style. Jolie is perfectly cast and makes a good Lara Croft, but she has nothing to work with. It's just her saying something witty and then shooting some poor robot. Tomb Raider is not as bad as the loathsome ""Mummy Returns"", but it does make one wonder if Hollywood even tries anymore.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
250,puma31219,Untapped potential,6,27 April 2020,"I played all of the Tomb Raider games by the time the film came out and I was very excited, though skeptical. Angelina Jolie didnt seem like the ideal choice in my head but after seeing the film I was thoroughly impressed with her performance. She had charisma, she was believable and her accent was on POINT! My critique lies with the plot. I feel like they may have jammed too much into one film. Lara literally only raids ONE TOMB throughout the entire movie and she does it with a group of competitors stealing the spotlight which is such a far cry from the game. Having a sub-plot with her descended dad, the planetary alignment, the illuminati, her failed romance with an American accented Daniel Craig, her being ""too manish""- it was all a bit much for one film and seriously could have paved out better into a trilogy. The first film should have been about her actually raiding tombs and either discovering or setting off some type of global catastrophe on the other side of the world that she didn't know about until halfway through the film. Just spit balling here but mainly that there were way too many thematic elements in the film, none of which involved her actually being an adventure archeologist.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
251,words_like_violence_brea,oh deary deary me....,1,10 March 2006,"It was a beautiful summers day and there were three clouds in the sky to be precise. As dawn approached i cooled off with a chilled shower and slipped into my finest robe. I calmly walked down stairs and entered the living room where I continued to turn on the television. As the sun slipped behind the horizon, i knew that night was upon me. The DVD labelled ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was engulfed by the player and the credits begun to roll.100 beautifully appreciated minutes later, I was startled by the respectable and proficient talent and fine script work of the movie. I eventually enticed myself to watch it in full one more time, about 10 minutes of silent appreciation (in the dark).After another 100 minutes I came to a certain decision that I would have to write to the producers to let them know how much I love this film. Knowing that I would not be able to sleep a wink until I got a reply I quickly helped my self to 4 Biro pens and began by hand to write a brief 100 page booklet letting the producers know how I felt.To this day I never got a reply, and have'nt slept since overall: I HATE IT",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
252,prezike,Zzzzzzzzz....,4,17 June 2001,"Well, I was most definitely disappointed with this film.  I know Hollywood is entrenched in ""formula"" film making but this was a big time snoozer outside of watching a quite beautiful looking Angelina Jolie look cool and mean the entire picture.  The plot, which had a great deal of potential, and the characters, were all not developed enough.  The other actors were boring as well, and there seemed to be little dialogue between anyone either.  The effects were ok, (even Jolie's fake breasts looked odd at times) but nothing to write home about.  I'm sure they will turn this into a series of films...here's hoping they VASTLY improve upon the next adventure.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
253,couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn,"Nice action, horrible storyline",5,19 June 2001,"Note: There might be spoilers aheadI didn't feel that I wasted my money to see this movie...because I got a discount. Basically, this movie was a simple adventure movie with good action scenes that are far and few in between, held together by a lame plot.The highlight of the movie was in the very beginning of the movie, in the first fight scene. That scene left me with an impression that the movie would be good, and that impression was completely gone about the time the movie had reached its 1/2 way mark. The not only did the plot suck, but character development was unripe, and the jokes were completely predictable. I hated the subplot involving the father...Jolie does a good job of looking the part, but she can't convince me that the character cares enough for her father to try to bring him back to life with the risk of destroying the world (--;).Another thing, what the heck is up with her and that other tomb raider.  I could see them flirting, but come on, does that convince me that Croft cares enough about the guy to try to bring him back to life too? Especially when he has shown himself to be someone who can't be trusted.Lara Croft's relationship with the other characters, along with the actions she chooses to take in different situations, made her a weak character, built up on contradicting evidences. I really didn't like the character, even though I wanted to. That's what really gets me about the writers of this movie. They don't spend enough time to try to invigorate the plot; instead, they spend too much time creating unbelievable and weak characters.What made it worse was the horrible ending scene. Maybe they ran out of money...but those spray-painted orange spheres doesn't quite seem like it's made by the same civilization that built the 1st tomb. It looks more like a cheap amusement ride. And am I supposed to feel a sense of danger from seeing heavily armed guys falling into the water beneath because they got hit by one of the circling arms? I really wish the writers would have been more imaginative.Basically, one would go see this movie for the hype, Jolie, the few action scenes, and for the sake of the actual game. If you have a lot of time, and have some money, it's not a bad flick to watch...the producers spent enough money on this to be somewhat entertaining.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

256,Morgan-10,Close but no cigar....,5,16 June 2001,"Well that was unfortunate.  I thought Tomb Raider had a lot of potential but it failed to deliver.  The biggest failing, as others have mentioned, is the script which is awful.  Considering what they're given to work with the acting is pretty decent at least for Jolie and the lead bad guy.  Jon Voigt is cheesy and the 'love' interest is boring. Because the script is bad it felt like they were just piecing action sequences together so they became ho-hum. I think part of it was the music.  Action sequences really need energetic music to get you into it and I just didn't get that from TR. 
I think if it had been more campy it could have been great but it was trying to be serious and the story was completely incapable of delivering that kind of quality.I was with seven people and the reaction ranged from 'that was 2 hrs of my life I'll never get back' to 'it wasn't too bad, not as bad as Battlefield Earth' to 'the effects were cool'.  These were given in roughly descending order by age.I gave it a disappointed 5/10 as I was mildly entertained and it was slightly better than Battlefield Earth.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

258,Mercader79,The Girl is Not Enough,3,17 July 2001,"Clearly it is not in dispute that Miss Jolie as Lara is a truly arresting and very fetching Buffy-esque Uber babe, but even so: this is a dull, dull film. I forgot most of it even before I left the cinema.What is it with blockbusters these days? Call me a nostalgic old duffer but in the 80s they used to be genuinely original and entertaining. Think: Back to the Future, Aliens, Ghostbusters, Star Wars and sequels, The Terminator etc. There were duds as well as course, but except for Starship Troopers and T2 I cannot think of any blockbuster of similar calibre in the last decade. There is an imaginative vacuum at the core of Hollywood.Shower scenes aside, I only really perked up once - during the sub-Ray Harryhausen 'statues coming to life' bit. But even this proved a let-down. Lara merely shot them.Apart from Jon Voigt's embarrassing American excess of sentimentalism cameo, Tomb Reader is not generally terrible to watch and Angelina in garb is certainly pleasing to behold.

I can't see how she could have been nominated for worst actress.   Lora Croft is an archeologist/adventurer that must race against time to recover an anicient artifact that can control time.  She is opposing the Iluminati, a secret society, who, of corse, wants to rule the world. While there are alot of scenes that look like their straight from any of the Indiana Jones films.  LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER can't measure up to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it is entertaining to someone who really doesn't mind a terribly simple plot, and some bad acting.  The action scenes are amazing, and the visual effects are dazzling.  The fight scene at the end wasn't great, but hey, what are you gonna' do.  What I'm trying to get through is many people over-looked the good aspects of the film and looked at the bad far to much!I give LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER 6.5/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
260,TomPaine-3,A film for the losers in all the world,1,7 July 2001,"I could never see or understand the fuss about the character of Lara Croft and her adventures in the Tomb Raider series of games. To me, she was a female fantasy figure for the thousands of losers and SB's who wasted their time playing those games and who could not be bothered to go out and find the real thing. Fantasies tend to be safer you see.Having now seen the film version of Tomb Raider, I still cannot see the fascination people have of the pneumatic chested Lara.It is a bad film. And it's boring.And there is nothing worse than a boring, bad movie. One expects a film like this to come from a hack like Simon West whose resume includes Con-Air (need I say more).But I expected better from good actors such as Angeline Jolie, Iain Glen and Daniel Craig to be laboured with such a banal, laboured and obvious script.Glen seemed to sleepwalk through his part with all the villany and menace of a Chartered Surveyor. He not mailed his part in but mailed it in without the stamp. And why was an English actor used to play an American (Craig)? Why not use an American actor to play an American. Such was the oddball casting of this film that an American was used to play an Englishwoman with an English accent nobody could place and a Englishman was hired to play an American with an American accent that did not stay in one place.All in all, a waste of everybodies time and talent. 1 out of 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Well, perhaps anybody more interested in Ingmar Bergmann's comedy or Woody Allen's darkness.There are, surely, lots of mistakes, errors and omissions in this pure, entertaining fun in the vein of Rider Haggard, Ian Fleming or old school space adventure. I could point to the not very wise choice in casting some of the characters, or to the total lack of any characterisation. Not to speak of logic. Although there is one moment in this flick, which really should have been a bit more logical; to give away no spoiler - how can there be a spoiler in a movie lacking logic? - let's just say that something very funny can be observed when Lady Lara escapes from the Khmer temple (witness her adversaries and ask yourself what they are doing just before she comes out ...).But all this doesn't really matter, this movie is just a helluva fun ride; it never takes itself too seriously (one of the freat errors with the latest Bond films), it always shows that it is a video game come alive. And don't forget its main assets [sic]: Angelina Jolie, who not only looks gorgeous but acts in a movie that doesn't ask for it. My favourite example is her facial expression whenever she kills of a baddie or a monster, Lara really likes to be on top ...",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Only a few action scenes give you the feel of the movie and get you excited. Besides that- if there is a sequel- there's no way it could be worse than this.
Good job for Angelina Jolie finally getting a superhero and a nice leading role. But frankly, i'd rather picked Pearl Harbor to be the sponsor of movie popcorn- because Pearl Harbor is much better than Tomb Raider.

The movie was HORRIBLE worst movie I have seen this year...I even like 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND better. The only reason I gave this movie a 1/10 is because I can't even give it a 1/2 out of ten and the only reason it would get a half a star is because Jolie looked quite attractive in the movie. TOMB RAIDER ripped off movies such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and THE FUGITIVE. It had the worst ending possible, leaving you saying, ""Why did I just waste two hours of my life when I could've been doing something better...like going to the bathroom."" Which I wish I would've done instead. The urinals in the movie theaters bathroom would have been TEN THOUSAND times more interesting.

Some of the action or ""tasks"" are a little far fetched but that is to be expected.  Angelina Jolie is perfect in this role.  All of the villains in this movie have the conflict we have come to expect from action movies. Purely evil, but sly...weak and money hungry, and internally conflicted.Sadly the worst performance in the movie is by Voight.  He is totally unbelievable as her father.  His performance was without emotion or interest.As a final note the shameful prosthetic breasts Angelina was wearing were insulting.

So its no surprise that Hollywood has tried to tap into this audience.  However with the exception of 1995's ""Mortal Kombat,"" their attempts have mostly been met with dismal failure. Remember ""Street Fighter,""  ""Wing Commander"" or the embarrassment that was the ""Super Mario brother's"" movie?  I didn't think so.  Audiences stayed away in droves from these bottom feeding movies.   And this really shouldn't be a surprise. Most of the games in question have exceedingly thin storylines.  However, this is not a problem with the `Tomb Raider' series.Lara croft is a wealthy, globe-trotting archeologist in the vein of Indiana Jones.  Plenty of opportunity for intriguing storylines here.And indeed the movie's plot is fairly interesting.  But its not riveting either.  And this is a problem that plagues the entire movie.I was strangely ambivalent throughout the entire film.  While I enjoyed Angelina Jolie's performance -- the rest of the cast's was nothing to write home about.  The action scene's were well done -- but too few and far between.

Still I was disappointed.I have to make it clear that I'm not a fan of the computer games. I don't have a special relation to the Lara Croft character. All I know is that she is supposed to be sexy and she is - in the film at least. It's always enjoyable to see a movie with Angelina Jolie but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider doesn't reach her usual standard.While sitting in the cinema I felt that I was watching a movie made of leftovers. The Story reminded me of Indiana Jones but I think the Tomb Raider script ismade up of some the scenes that were not good enough to be in any of thethree Indiana Jones movies. The attacking statues in the temple in Cambodiamade me think of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. I think the statues inTomb Raider were fired from The Mummy set for being unconvincing. Whenthey find the first half of the triangle the fluid reminded me of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It was made i 1991 yet the effects are still better.By now it should be obvious that I don't like Tomb Raider very much. After an hour I was waiting for it to finish and I wasn't sad when it did. I will give three stars. One goes to Christopher Barrie who plays Lara's butler Hillary.

The direction is completely without subtlety; West at times leans towards the pornographic - the early shower scene is a good example of this. The dialogue is prepostrous and most of it seems to have been taken from ""The Big Book Of Clichés"". Jolie does her best and just about gets away with a plummy English accent, yet receives no support from the rest of the cast. The villains are shallow and one dimensional, while Croft's allies, especially Chris Barrie's butler, are simply annoying.Tomb Raider's plot has been seen a thousand times before, but this would not matter had the premise been executed stylishly and credibly.

It provides a lot of interesting locations and original scenes.Which don't, you know, actually add up to anything fun or memorable because the editing is so terrible.It's telling that the only scene where the stakes feel high is the opening action sequence which is revealed to just be Lara's elaborate training room. The ""fake"" training room feels more dangerous (and cool! and memorable!) than anything in the rest of the movie which is supposed to be ""real"". Yeah.The editing is bad. As in ""worst I've ever seen"" terrible. At a storyboarding level, key establishing shots, connecting shots, reaction shots etc. are missing. The dramatic pacing is completely off, narrative foreshadowing/callbacks are MIA, otherwise good fight scenes mishandled. Characters do inexplicable things. Events happen for no reason.

I liked it. Having played the firsts few games and being rubbish at it not carried on I was very aware of the concept and awesome possibility of a film, I assumed they'd just mess it up.
They DID emphasise the user fantasy of catching glimpses of things meant to be hidden so it was tantalising in a clearly sexual way to entice new teens or old teens.
As far as the film - not a bad tune to the Lara Croft symphony. It got the competition aspect in and many of the plot items.
I LIKED the film. I wouldn't watch it again for maybe 3-5 years (that is my scale... never or how long before. As it's not a never I'd recommend it worthy as I've watched it three times already).
A bit too TWEE in parts like when you have a chance to kill a baddie and don't 'it happens' but when you dither a tad too long and then fail because you delayed, it's obviously a bad direction or writing decision.I don't think the last bit is a spoiler tbh as it doesn't happen at the end and is a surprise tbh",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

279,Yoda Bowman 2001,Kicked A$$!,10,18 June 2001,I absolutely loved this movie. It was just a ton of fun and had some good laughs and Angelina Jolie is great has Lara. But what suprised me was that there was in fact a sense of character. Which is not what I was expecting.Non-stop action + Humor + Good Acting + Great sets and F/X + Angelina Jolie =KICK A$$ MOVIE!!!,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
280,bobscott,The pain!,1,30 November 2002,"Every so often, a movie comes along that makes half the world reel in agony at its tremendous horridity while the other half of the world delights in the blissful ignorance that is their lives. Tomb Raider is such a movie.From beginning to end, I waited for something to simply happen! The action scenes were dull, the special effects weren't special at all, seeming almost dull when compared to films of comparable budget. There were far too many ""dramatic"" lulls for this film to even be classified in the action genre.Which brings me to the acting. What had moviegoers done to deserve this cast, this script, this monstrosity?! I have no real qualms with any of the actors themselves, as I've seen most of them in other films that weren't as sickeningly horrid as this film. It's just that maybe they didn't get enough sleep the night before most of the scenes were shot? I don't really know how to explain away an entire untalented cast in this one film! I expected that Chris Barrie would have provided some comedy, but instead, he was just sort of ""there"" like the rest of the cast.That there were certain respected critics saying that this was a ""fun"" movie completely astounds me. That anyone can truly call this a great film is baffling. But to each his own, I guess. I'd sooner choose such video-game-to-big-screen films as ""Resident Evil"" or... um... Well, I can't think of any other game-to-movie films that were really all that great. But I'd guess it's safe to say that Tomb Raider would have to rank near the very bottom of the pile!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
281,6325,Good looking Angela Jolie battles against a weak script,4,27 November 2001,"The female Indiana Jones certainly has the better looks, but the movie itself is way below the Indy-trilogy. May be worth a rent for a lazy afternoon but certainly not good enough for multiple viewings. The script is a mixture of action and fantasy - and somehow it seems that the director couldn't really decide which way he should go. The result is not really satisfying...",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
282,patrick3201,Deserves a sequel,8,20 July 2001,"I went to see two films last week: 2001 and Tomb Raider (don't laugh!).2001 is a brilliant brilliant film but almost totally devoid of any characterisations whatsoever. The acting is purely functional, like an illustration from a science textbook. Despite this, it's a good film because the story and the direction are perfectly executed.Tomb Raider on the other hand is a film with a very badly executed plot. Ms Croft's motives become very unclear towards the end, where the narrative seems to fall apart from the moment Ms Croft simply hands over to her enemies a vital artefact she's been fighting for. The climax is especially muddled, with tension in the finale practically non-existent. Earlier set pieces are much more impressive and exciting, especially the raid on Croft Manor.However, for some reason I really liked the film, and I think I know why. Even most of the bad reviews mentioned that Angelina Jolie was the best woman for the job, and I'd have to agree. Jolie conveys something no actress since Diana Rigg has managed, to be a convincing independent action heroine who isn't driven by some po-faced desire for power or a wish to be a man. The director of the film compared Jolie to Sigourney Weaver, but I think Weaver is much more serious and much less charismatic. Jolie in this film presents something unique at the moment, a non-serious strong and playful leading woman who doesn't turn to anyone else to solve her problems. I might also add that it's a very new and strange (but probably also extremely healthy) experience to heroine-worship a woman you're also lusting over.For me, the height of the characterisation is right at the end, where Croft is in the middle of fleeing a collapsing cave and for no particular reason she starts to beam a satisfied smile, as if she's getting off on the jeopardy.The way Jolie's Croft just cheerfully goes ahead and does things is reminiscent of Sean Connery's Bond, and this is why I think it deserves a sequel. The first Bond film, Dr No, was pretty dull and derivative, but Connery and the whole formula of camp adventure well delivered was the thing reviewers at the time picked up on. The set-up in Tomb Raider is good too, and I could well see Croft Manor and Chris Barrie's butler being a nice equivalent to M, Q and Moneypenny.The characters are good, the premise is good, the setting is good, Angelina Jolie is excellent (and essential to any sequel). If they could just nail down a better script and some more tension-building direction as well, I'd be first in line to see Tomb Raider II.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
283,sperman69,"BAD... no, WORSE!(spoiler warning)",2,20 August 2001,"I think this movie was a complete crap, from the beginning to the end. I wasn't expecting much, but I'm sorry to admit that it was below expectance! Poor plot: you already know the end after more or less 2 minutes and you can guess the full plot with most details after maybe 15 minutes. Poor actors: even the use of a good actor such as John Voigt doesn't improve because he was assigned a mostly irrelevant role (a bit like King Arthur in Costner's ""Robin Hood"" :)). The ""bad guys"" are all bad and mean and dressed in black and the good guys are all beautiful and perfect. The realization is a poor copy that oscillates between Mission Impossible and Matrix and the dialogues and mostly pointless. Probably U2's video is better than the movie itself! The only reason I didn't give 1 is because Angelina Jolie looks extremely pretty, cool and she kicks ass...  ;)",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
284,mrmunkoms,"This movies was great, until it started",3,10 November 2002,"This movie just plain old sucked.  Angelina was a good Lara Croft, but the movie itself was very boring.  I recommend that no one sees this movie unless you are being payed to watch it.  The story isn't all that bad but I just really hated this movie.  Not the worst movie I have seen but definitely not good.  Avoid at all costs. 3/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
285,mcrabtre2001,Great female action film but at least it is not on breasts!,8,20 February 2002,"This movie is good. It has great action scenes. Like there is one with at the beginning where she is fighting the robot. Lara did a summersault scene(Take that Bad Blade Runner movie). Then there was this good fight scene where they were about to fight the statues and before the fight started the movie was setting up the atmosphere with the bad guys putting the giant swords in the slots at the tomb of Archielles. The movie is also good because Angelina Jolie was chosen as the perfect actress for the action movie queen.It is just like choosing Sean Connery in 1962 James Bond Dr.No. At least this movie better than watching that awful Crouching Tiger which had no storyline at all. While this one had killing and at least some storyline even if it wasn't that too much better. If you like action/drama movies then this is the film to watch. It is even better than X-Men How could people say this movie is bad. People like watching killing and at least it is still good to watch. People were saying that the reviews were wrong but it is the people that are wrong because the reason Tomb Raider got a better review than that garbage Pearl Harbour movie because Tomb Raider was better. Pearl Harbour deserves to get a bad review, it is considered to be the worst war film in the entire world. While this may not be the best movie but it is the best female action film ever. The movie started off really good especially since Lara had to get information about the key. Because if they don't find it they'll have to wait for another 5,000 years. I can't wait for Tomb Raider 2 to come out. I will be seeing you In TOMB 2 ANGELINA.Rating: 8/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
286,highpriestess32,Enjoyable for Genuine Raiders,7,30 September 2017,"I'll be honest with you here, I hadn't even heard of Angelina Jolie until my brother gave me his copy of this DVD having abandoned it during some of the early scenes.By this time I was already playing and enjoying the early games - notably TR II before I played the original and progressed to TR III in that order.TR II was a masterpiece in terms of gaming. It was vibrant and diverse, covering many locations - most notably Venice and China, locations that were covered in the two Jolie movies combined to my recollection, among others.In order to play the heroine, Jolie had to gain muscle and play the games - in essence she had to BECOME Lara Croft. She had to absorb the quirky traits of this steadfast character in order to deliver an accurate portrayal to fans of the games (""Raiders"" as we call ourselves). Jolie performed many of her own stunts to her credit and was on a high protein diet in order to bulk up to the athletic standard required.The only thing that lets this movie down is arguably the dialogue in spite of a very touching scene between Jolie and Voight - her then real- life estranged father. It was the pain of their real-life situation that oozed through the screen with a sense of great sadness. Jolie's accent was flawless but I feel the dialogue could have been less twee in parts.The reason my older brother abandoned the movie was due to a rather reality-suspending scene of an ambush in Croft Manor. Character Lara was engaged in some form of indoor bungee exercise wearing some sort of satin pyjama set yet, initially unarmed, managed to single-handedly take out an entire SWAT team with her cunning and athletic prowess, only managing to tool-up when she snatches a weapon from one of her bungee- captives.If you are happy to suspend belief then your kids will enjoy it. The sequel is more Bond-like however and a more believable movie. Nice to see a younger Daniel Craig in this debut TR film though!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
287,VerbalKint-2,What more could you ask of a summer action flick?,8,16 June 2001,"Plot - A little weak, to be sure, but it's a summer action movie.  I'm impressed that I got any plot at all, especially after seeing ""The Mummy Returns.""   Uggghhhh...Action - Awesome.  Not there all the time (which is a good thing), but more than enough to keep my blood pumping.  The action in Cambodia reminded me sooooo much of the Tomb Raider PC games (which is also a good thing).Acting - Certainly not Jolie's finest hour, but she wasn't given much to work with.  The scenes involving her father were touching, though I thought Jon Voight was at his weakest.  Other characters are actually caricatures, which is typical for this type of movie.  I did love the Hilary the butler, though.Tomb Raiding - Not enough puzzle solving, with the exception of the final ""tomb"".  That's my only complaint in this category.  UNBELIEVABLE Art Direction / Set Design.  I wish those places were real...they were both very beautiful and deeply mysterious.All in all, I got what I was hoping for from this movie:  big action, a small plot, a gorgeous heroine, and some laughs.  Summer fun doesn't get much finer.8/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

My wife wanted to see this more than I did (although looking at Angelina Jolie for a couple of hours isn't all bad). I don't like Mummy movies all that much. But I have to admit I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It is a no brainer with good acting, and great f/x. Half the time I didn't know what was going on, but it mostly made sense in some strange way. Also, it was great to see Angelina and her real dad Jon Voight on the screen together. It was a very touching scene.So, leave your troubles at home and go see this popcorn movie. Don't think about it too much, and have a good time.  I give it an 8 out of 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

There is no doubt it was a ""polished"" film in the Hollywood sense.  But, it lacked emotion, soul, passion and, most importantly PLOT!!! The special effects were good, but not good enough to overshadow the complete lack of character development and the primarily stiff, emotionless, passionless performances by ALL of the actors and actresses (Jolie included).  As well, the very lame attempts at humour only exacerbated the boredom engendered by the total lack of plot.  It's a shame that with such a promising story line, excellent product association, and a big budget that all Hollywood could produce was a stinking turd wrapped in nice, shiny celluloid.  This one gets a very generous 3.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

292,James-328,Never make a movie from a video game; like The SS Titanic it will sink,7,8 July 2001,"Tomb Raider joins the ranks of the many movies that try and remake a successful game; eg. Street Fighter, Super Mario Bros. and Mortal Kombat. I had high hopes for the film, it sounded promising with Simon West directing, and a wide range of cast. With the success of Con Air, how could he go wrong.(This review does have some parts that may slightly spoil the movie if you have not seen it).Easy with a story that is too sentimental and convoluted, a bad guy that seems apathetic, and special effects that come close in the worse special effects award 2001, coming closely to The Mummy Returns. The polystyrene rocks falling on her were probably the most danger she was ever in. Then there are the parallels that are hard not make: Raiders of the Lost Ark and James Bond. There is a sense that she is never really in danger, or is going to get hurt, only when she holds a knife by the blade, duh!
ANGELINA JOLIE has the aristocratic english accent perfect, but her acting as the all action, kick ass, armed to the teeth girl who takes no ****, is just rather dull, as the film reveals she is actually a loner who wants her Father back, what about her Mother?The locations were promising; Cambodia, Iceland and England. Iceland filming was boring, the trek across the waste lands, Cambodia; the jeep was good, the walk around the temple, the child giving her strange mystical advice, follow the butterflies was not, but atleast the little girl had a good laugh. The sets were so set like, they had no realism, or gripping images.Contrary to the views you now must have on me. I do have some good points about the film. IAIN GLEN, even though he came across as a dull enemy delivered his lines well. Angelina's chest gets a special merit award, for having to cope with a padded bra, and all those stairs! The action sequences were good, especially the bungee ballet sequence which is the movie's highlight. Simon West's directing certainly was not dull when it came to action: the bike, the jeep, the bungee, the huskees, the shower scene! CHRIS BARRIE as Hilary the butler was a good character, as the comic input. DANIEL CRAIG as the good/bad character Alex West, was ok, his accent was good. NOAH TAYLOR as Bryce, was the most certain and interesting character. LESLIE PHILIPS part was disappointing as it was about 5 minutes of screen time. The music was great, it helped the action, and made certain scenes very exciting.Overall a movie that will go to number one in the UK as it did in the US. The sequel will almost certainly be made. What can I say, other than that it had an excellent advertising campaign that has worked drawing in huge audiences. MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT- is the key word I would give to this movie, it is'nt terrible, and it is certainly not an award winning masterpiece. I would give this 6 OUT OF 10!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
293,silverandblack72,Don't listen to the critics,7,15 June 2001,"After just exiting the theater, I have to say that after watching this movie, it reinforces my belief that most movie critics are completely out of touch with movie goers and what we want to see.  Is this an Oscar worthy film?  No, of course not.  Is it  highly entertaining and worth the price of admission.  YES!  Angelina Jolie does a wonderful job of bringing Lara Croft to life, and the director brings to the screen a lavish touch of cinema art. All who are thinking about purchasing a ticket to see this film, take my word (I had no clue that Tomb Raider was a computer game until two days ago) and purchase a ticket with the confidence that you will see an entertaining movie.

I was wrong, it was only an hour and a half, and I enjoyed it. First of all, Angelina Jolie is amazing as Lara Croft, and she's one of the sexiest actresses in Hollywood. Second, the action sequences are unbeleivable (my favourite being the opening sequence). So what if it's plot is unoriginal? This movie is still entertaining. This movie does have it's faults too. Like, every character other than Lara is dull and uninteresting. And it does get a bit silly. Well, the plot has to do with the ""clock of ages"" which is activated during a planetary alignment that occurs once every 5000 years. The clock has the power to cause great evil, and Lara can't let that happen. Well, if you loved the video game or just like action/adventure, go see this movie!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Only Angelina was capable to revive this movie doomed to dumbness and lack of style already at the beginning..but unfortunately our young Oscar-winner seems to loose her feeling for roles. She tried her best, but most of the film's team were a total miscast, which caused that mess on the screen which was supposed to be one of the best entertainments of the season.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
298,phil0011,"I'm sorry, was this supposed to be fun?",3,18 July 2003,"I feel I need to go on a bit of a rant after seeing this film. Tomb Raider appears to be another film that insists on giving us action scenes which are not only poorly directed but also poorly edited. I presume the choreographer did a good a job though his work will go unnoticed due to the butcher job Mr. Simon West did with all his hard work. I, for one, could not fathom what was going on in any of the gun-toting action sequences. With The Matrix setting bench marks in action film making it still seems surprising to me when directors use this approach to fight scenes, allowing us only fractions of a second to decipher the scene. In the past few years alone both the Wachowski's (The Matrix) and Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) managed to give measured and assured fight scenes in which we could see the motions and the choreography. I'm surprised at how bad the action in this film was, seen as Simon West did the hugely enjoyable Con Air. It seems that he has worsened with age.What about everything else in this film, I hear you say? Well, Angelina Jolie is assured and does her job well, but is not outstanding. As for the rest of the actors - I didn't really notice any special performances. Only Chris Barrie (aka Arnold Rimmer) was a shining beacon as he proved huge Hollywood blockbusters were as easy as doing small, low-budget BBC sitcoms. The script was undetectable and did not make the slightest bit of sense. In fact, it seemed that Lara could have prevented the world from ending a good hour before the end of the film. But I would have accepted the discrepancies in the script if getting to the end of the ninety minutes was enjoyable, and not a chore. Alas, it was not to be.When I went to see this film I was not expecting a work of groundbreaking film making. I was, however, expecting some nice enjoyable popcorn fodder, along the lines of Blade, Triple X, X-Men 2 and Eight Legged Freaks. What I in fact got was a banal exercise in poor editing and bad direction. I just hope that come Tomb Raider 2 the producers have learnt a few lessons and won't accept an inferior multi-million dollar product. Something more exciting next time, please.For those that care, I gave this film 3/10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

She tried her best to do all her own stunts and i think it was a reflection in her acting. **SPOILERS**I loved the sun and the planet room, i thought it was a great set, and i thought her house was FANTASTIC!all in all it was a great film with action and jokes all the way.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

301,Steveo1986,Amazing...,1,24 March 2006,"... but not at all in a good way. It was a pointless action movie with barely a plot to it at all. But the really amazing was that not even the ""special"" effects could lift this big mess of a film. I'm genuinely not surprised if even the most hardcore Tomb Raider/Lara Croft fans were disappointed at this film. Luckily I saw this on TV so I didn't have to pay watch this disaster, seeing as I'd already seen its rather average sequel Cradle Of Life.All that was in this was Angelina Jolie trying to make her character sexy but somehow just wasn't, somersaulting, swinging and jumping around and away from robots and gunmen. Also something about recovering a clock puzzle. Boring. I mean, come on! What were the people behind this on or thinking? They didn't try anywhere near hard enough and it just turned out a boring mess. It definitely has to be the worst and most disappointing action movie ever. All the characters were bland, even Angelina Jolie. The performances were unimpressive, forgettable and rather cringe-worthy. Don't bother with this crap, because it's very disappointing and boring. Rent Cardle Of Life or just stick to the games because they are much better and have meaning to them.

302,Rioter,"Flashy, action-packed nonsense",3,8 December 2001,"Given that Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is based on a video game series, it should come as no surprise that the film is driven primarily by visually-pleasing spectacles, rather than a coherent, clever plot. And in this, the movie does justice to the games.The movie jumps from scene to scene, often paying little- or no attention to issues of time and location changes. The locations themselves are one of the most fantastic aspects of the movie; from London to Cambodia to Siberia, nearly every location depicted is strikingly beautiful and worked in seamlessly. The animations are also often impressive. The robot Lara interacts with is appropriately mechanical in its movements, but seems realistic. The stone monsters seen in the trailers are also well-done.Unfortunately, the locations and the graphics are essentially the only things done well. The plot itself is paper-thin; there is essentially no reason the bad guys should allow Lara to be involved in things, and the dialogue is unbelievable; most comments seem intended to explain things to the audience, rather than the other characters.However, the biggest problem is the unoriginality and unintelligence of the movie. There is a scene that is a blatant rip-off of ""The Fugitive"" and the entire movie in general feels like a bad ""Bond."" I could go on and on about the flaws here: The pointless butlers/nerds/sidekicks that she lives with, the fact that everyone across the globe seems to know her life story, the action star cliches... but the point is: don't bother seeing this movie, unless for Angelina Jolie herself.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I played all the games and the way you imagine Lara would look and act in real life, is just right. There are great action scenes (mind you a bit unrealistic to say the least), and technically the movie is okay. It´s only held down by a bad script. But now they have seen it´s possible to make money on these kinds of movies, so my guesh is that ""Tomb Raider The Sequel"" will have a way better script, and possibly another director.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Those critical of action movies, however, should probably avoid it.  This IS an action movie and that's what it does best!  I think they did a great job of bringing Lara Croft to life and showing Tomb Raider on the big screen.  I read about some of the difficulties in doing so, but they seem to have made the right decisions.  The initial action scene was sooo representative of the game, I was leaning this way and that way in my seat!  Angelina had the right amount of sassiness, but don't expect much character development. About the only thing I didn't like was her, evidently, ex-boyfriend.  I guess I would have expected Lara to have a little more taste.  Also, our initial meeting suggestions Lara distains him but, then, near the end of the movie we get the feeling that she really loves him - only to be left in the air at film's end.

This is yet another fine example of modern big budget Hollywood film making: let's make the movie as loud and special effects laden as possible so that maybe people won't pay attention to the fact that we wrote our script on a bubble gum wrapper.The few brief efforts in the movie to have plot or dialogue are so scattered and underdeveloped, Simon West and crew use over the top music to try and create dramatic tension.  It doesn't work.Angelina Jolie is a beautiful, compelling performer:  with any luck, her next movie might offer her a chance to use her skills instead of stick them in an idiot film like this one.The worst movie I have seen in a long time, right down there with Armageddon.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I used to be an avid fan of the series, but four sequels on, the formula of the game has got very tired and overused.I still remember three years ago reading in a magazine, news of an upcoming Tomb Raider movie. I refused to believe it, a ridiculous rumour, surely? More news was reported as time went by, disbelief followed. Then last year, I saw pictures of Jolie as Lara. Oh my God, they were serious. I was certain of its failure.I downloaded the trailer. A pathetic trailer to put it lightly. It was the final step in convincing me... ""this film will fail"". The film was released, bad reviews followed, I was as smug as ever.It was out of sheer boredom that motivated me to actually see it.The final verdict? Not that bad. My low expectations probably fuelled my opinion to a more positive level. Don't get me wrong, I like my movies to have a plot, which was strangely absent in this movie. I guess I was just too much of a sucker for the brilliant action scenes. Angelina portrays Lara brilliantly and it was nice to see Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie on the big screen, although I feel he was kinda wasted, he has the potential of being a genuinely funny actor.A 6/10 from me.

308,erebus53,This film accomplishes everything it sets out to do.,7,24 October 2001,"In an action film based on a video game you can only hope that the cinematic rendition is true to the original feel of the game. In this instance I feel that the film has captured the essence of the Tomb Raider setting almost more so than the game itself. The problem solving element of the game is still there, yet it is less disjointed because it runs as a story, instead of an interface that arguably left a lot to be desired.Fantastic sets, attention to costuming, inventive choreography and CGI allow contrast enough that action scenes are both interesting and easy to follow. As you would hope, this is a film with great visuals.The plot is easy to follow and segmented into levels much in the same way that the video game was, yet this is not to the detriment of the pace of the film.The soundtrack is contemporary and helps maintain the action.Angelina Jolie has the accent of Lara Croft down brilliantly. She is as much like the game character as any human would want to be. What she lacks in the bustline she makes up for with onscreen charisma. The casting of her real life father (Jon Voigt) as her onscreen father is a nice touch.The plot is not deep, but it doesn't have to be. If you have heard rumours of the plot containing time travel elements, rest assured that this is barely touched on and does not make the movie any ""cheesier"" than it already is.If you are after a deep plot, full frontal nudity and huge breasts, this is not the film for you, but if you are prepared to take your action with a grain of salt then you can expect an entertaining film that achieves everything it sets out to do.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

310,thereturnoftheking,LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER....WOW!!!!!!(spoilers),8,26 February 2004,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider-a Review by Jonathan CasoDirected by: Simon West Written by: Simon West, Patrick Masset, & John Zinnman Starring: Angelina Jolie (Lady Lara Croft), Daniel Craig (Alex West), Jon Voight (Lord Richard Croft), Iain Glenn (Manfred Powell), & Noah Taylor (Bryce)
	From the wonderfully action-packed and edge-of-you-seat beginning, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, is probably one of my favorite and one of the best films this year.  Though it essentially rings the bell of `popcorn-flick,' it has those moments where it essentially rises to be an arcade of great fun.
	Angelina Jolie after her Oscar win for Girl, Interrupted, gave in a big flop with a terrible performance, in Original Sin, but I found her performance here to be pure fun and truly a joy to watch.  She equally and essentially balances the two sides, conflicted British girl with the loss of her father, and `Tomb Raider' needing to save the world.  I personally would give her an award for this one.  She really also saves the film from almost pure destruction. 	Though it can easily be mistaken as single action flick with one long special effect, I must say that it is nothing of the sort.  Though I cannot deny the fact that the effects are amazing and worthy of a nomination, it has long periods of thought-provoking silence where they ponder their answers to unanswered questions.  I also thought that the performance of Noah Taylor was rather good with the right comedic timing and Angelina there to back him up, this film scores with me. 	The only two performances that brought the film down were Jon Voight, and Iain Glenn's which are both rather embarrassing to watch.  Especially since Jon Voight is, as many know, one of the best out there.  It's just here he seems to abandon it all and give a C grade performance.  When you compare it here to the one in Midnight Cowboy, you wonder how in the hell he is the same actor.  But you can look past it since he is sort of not in too much.	Other than a few performances, I believe the film is worthy of the title, `Indiana Jones's daughter.' She was amazingly brave (though who isn't in films like this), and had this spunk, which shines through in the film.  I have played the video games so I sort of knew what to expect, but this was actually better than I expected.  Though I loved the film there was this one scene that almost made me change my mind.  Jolie is fighting intruders in her home and as she walks around walls on a bungee cord they fire at her with bullets flying a mile a minute?!?!?  Also right after that scene she is in her garage and to get away from the intruders must take her motorcycle and jump it off one of her cars while firing her gun and killing them. Also?!?!?  	Either way I loved this film, especially compared to the let down that was Pearl Harbor and The Mummy Returns.  Though I gave The Mummy Returns some points for having a tough act to follow, there was no excuse for the badness of Pearl Harbor which should have been good considering the fact that they had a screenplay from the great Randall Wallace to work off of.  Too sad, but Tomb Raider, pulls up the summer slump to fine form as this film makes my top ten of the year. A- (****) An Excellent Film",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
311,edwardgamper-0-128609,Fun female led exotic action adventure movie,10,4 August 2021,"There literally isn't another movie like this. There's Indiana Jones and National Treasure and that's it. When it comes to female led exotic action adventure movies, this is it.It's comic book in style and very much in the video game world with bombastic and fantastical moments, but builds the world of Lara Croft well, establishes rules and doesn't break them.The biggest hurdle in the movie is getting last a slightly cringy opening scene with a robot which is super 90s, but once you're put of the initial action set piece, you're into the main plot...Taking place in England, Venice, Cambodia and Iceland, the sets and locations are stunning - I personally visited the Angkor Wat temples after I saw the movie and was inspired by how magical they looked. And they really do look that cool in real life too!Shot on 35mm with an eclectic soundtrack (from Graeme Revel who scored the movie in 10 days) which includes music from bands like Leftfield and Delerium, it sounds great too. There are amazing sets (the temples, Lara's home, Venice and Iceland) and Angelina Jolie delivers a quality performance that's the right blend of ballsy ass kicking, dry wit and attitude, making her more than a match for Bond or Dr Jones.The story is emotionally engaging and mysterious, with Lara's late father leaving her clues to a hidden artefact that can control time. Naturally bad guys also want the artefact, and Iain Glen is the perfect bad guy. He plays a sort of Lucifer'esque shadowy agent for the Illuminati who seek the powers of the mysterious ""triangle of light"".Lara's butler and geeky 90s hacker sidekicks are fun comic relief, and play substantial roles in the story too. And Daniel Craig in an early role, is a fantastic character with a duplicitous agenda, offering some light and shade and emotional conflict for Lara.The adventure takes Croft to ancient temples in Cambodia, shot on location in the late 90s just as Cambodia was opening back up to tourists after its dark past. And what's captured on film is iconic. Mystical architecture and jungles, as well as turning the modest lake in front of Angkor Wat into a bustling floating village, was the standout moment in the movie for me.The CGI is sparing and some of the effects actually still hold up surprisingly well 20 years on - with an amazing fight between the bad guys, lara and monkey statues brought to life when the artefact is disturbed.Compared to the 2018 reboot stuck in one location (like the rebooted games), this Lara is a globetrotting adventurer going from the humid asian jungles to the Icelandic tundra, via Venetian palaces and stately British homes.This movie and its equally fun sequel are really underrated. As far as video game adaptations go, I think are very good.Yes if you inspect the plot too hard it falls apart, but the point is, you're too busy having fun to care about the why's.10 stars. Pure popcorn entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously but delivers in a well paced action adventure.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
312,gwaterloo,Not nearly as bad as advertised,6,3 July 2021,"I enjoyed this. Not by any means anything spectacular, but with the right expectations, it is an enjoyable dumb movie with a charismatic enough performance from Angelina Jolie for it to make it a fun time,",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
313,clint77,Horrible,1,18 June 2001,"Oh my God. This movie is one of the worst. It's all about the action, but even the action sucks in this movie. Angeline doesn't even look like she can throw a good punch or a kick. The martial arts was horrible too. This story will drive you crazy. The writers misleads the whole point of the movie and throw you off the chart. You won't be able to understand, but if you do, you won't see any good plot in the movie. The acting was good, but it was still wrong to make this. It wasn't there fault at all, it was the dialogue and the director. Avoid this movie at all costs.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The story was boring and more than a little confusing.  The actors put NO heart into their characters at all.  I couldn't help but compare it to Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Raiders didn't have the whiz-bang effects that Tomb Raider had but it DID have characters you cared about and that is a serious flaw with Tomb Raider.  All in all, I would not recommend this film.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

She has a wild life apparently behind the scenes but i think she is one of the best actors in the world today! I liked Tomb Raider, I havent really played any of the games but i thought the movie was phenomenal! Great sound for all you DVD supporters! Sounds great on any system that sponsers 5.1 digital surround ! I just watched this movie that was recently purchased by a family member and we had the bonus of being able to view it on a 50inch t.v which just goes to show that the more people buy these big t.v's the more the local theatres will be forced to reduce these crazy admission prices!Now for the movie i saw alot of indiana jones in this film which is ok cause i am a fan of that series too.  Great special effects, watch for the scene in which lara(jolie) is bungee jumping within her own house. Goes to show you the size of house she owns.

317,kaworu-3,Better than I thought it would be,8,17 June 2001,"When I walked into this movie, I did not know what to expect.  I have played some ""Tomb Raider 2"" before, but I gave up trying to figure out the controls for that game after a couple of hours and have never touched a ""Tomb Raider"" product since.  In fact, I only saw this movie because a friend of mine wanted to see it.As far as video-game based movies go, you can't expect much along the lines of character development and plot.  And you won't get much along those lines in ""Tomb Raider"".  The story is merely a clothesline to hang one spectacular action sequence after another onto, and as thus, serves its purpose efficiently.What you will get is lots of Lara Croft fan-service (suggestive camera angles, pans, and the like), and the aforementioned spectacular action sequences.It throws in some good humor and does not dare to try to take itself seriously for one moment - and that it part of what makes it all work as well as it does.  It also has an attractive cast that gives mostly serviceable performances.What you have here is a thoroughly entertaining picture that delivers the goods that it promises without pretending to be anything more than it is. It promises action, and it promises Lara Croft fan service, and that is exactly what the viewer gets in very large amounts, without any pretense. True, it's no classic, and it is destined to be forgotten two years from now - but it does its job well.8 out of 10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

And to think I waited in a line to see this.  I do not know where others saw this movie but I was at the Chinese Theater is Hollywood, and no one laughed, applauded or seemed interested.A.J. made a grave mistake.  Anything director Simon West does is so so so so bad.  We is the worse director in the free world.  Lets not forget his head General's Daughter.

321,wirestone,Anti-Climatic End (spoiler),6,19 June 2001,"I didn't expect much from the movie, but still feel less than thrilled afterwards. The ridicules plot only serves to join the four action sequences, but that's okay, plots for this type of movies ain't always necessary. Actings are mediocre at best, but that's okay, the script doesn't gives the actors anything to act for. Angelina constantly flashes her boobs at you, but I guess that's okay too, that ain't much different from the game where Lara constantly flashes her behind at you. What I'm most disappointed is the last action sequence. The first three builds up quite nicely, each one more exciting than the previous, so I expected Lara to battle impossible odds against a demi-god at the end, but no, we are left with a quick hand-to-hand that can't even match that of Charlie's Angels, let along Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Matrix. Since the trailers gives away much of the action in the first three sequences, the last one was especially anti-climatic. Recent movies of this type, Mission Impossible 2 and Charlie's Angels are all done better with less FX.

323,0rbita1,One line? One word - abysmal. Only sadists would ask for more.,3,10 July 2001,"What's it all about?  Rather difficult to tell. Lara Croft is a chesticularly-challenged heiress with a taste for archaeology, inherited from her missing presumed dead Father. She has lots of money and guns, which she shoots a lot until the end of the film. Oh, and some nonsense about a clock and triangles and time travel but that doesn't seem to matter much... So, the film of THE game has finally arrived and, after endless publicity about 'who'll play Lara and how will she look', we finally have the answers. And none of them matter because of one simple, undeniable truth. Tomb Raider is abysmal. End of story. Though God knows I'm tempted to leave it there (and not relive the horror of that 100 minutes), let me expand.'TR' has clearly been produced with an attitude of contempt towards its many fans, and the moviegoer in general. In the light of the film's marketing (which, in retrospect, the studio must really be regretting), it is impossible not to compare 'TR' with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and the more recent 'Mummy' films. Yet it lacks the depth and gravitas of the former, the self-irony and breathless editing of the latter, and the high quality script bestowed on both. The studio clearly believed that the sexual dimension of the Lara Croft character, so played on by themselves, would be enough to compensate for it's many shortcomings. They were very, very wrong.The settings are bland, empty recreations of the Indiana Jones movies, the action scenes numbingly boring, uncreative and repetetive. Self-indulgent to the extreme, they've been done a hundred times, and a hundred times better. The soundtrack does the film no favours at all, it's horrendous overuse making you feel as though you've been duped into watching the Tomb Raider Lucozade advert over and over and over again. With the exception of Jolie (who, as always, provides a fine performance which recreates and expands on the look and spirit of Croft), the film is woefully miscast, and even fine actors such as Jon Voight are reduced to mouthing cliched and frequently cringeworthy drivel at a blameless audience. In terms of effects, the film already appears dated. The props, at least, provide some welcome amusement. Fresh from The Gadget Shop, many of them must have 'Made in Taiwan' stamped on their bottom. The bulky 'Pay As You Talk' Orange phone that appears on the dashboard of Lara's Land Rover is almost an anti-climax.There is nothing original here, and what is here is simply cold, soulless rubbish. It's a bland, predictable, boring, cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of the game by expending very little creative energy and few financial resources. The only good thing may be that Jolie's fantastic performance should lift her above taking on anything that sinks as low as this film.  Don't waste your time.3/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The fighting scenes in this were well corregraphed and completely stunning. And of course, Angelina Jolie was the perfect actress for this part, She made this movie that much more closer to the game. I have a lot more respect for her now knowing she did the majoirity of the stunts herself. I will admit, this movie lacked Drama and Character building, and yes, some of the stunts were un-likely, and, of course the plot was deffinatly fiction, but, I think most people forgot the purpose of movies. They are to be just, plain entertaining. They don't always have to make you know the Character and care for them, it was suposed to entertain the watcher.

327,Matt-33,Perfection: not always a good thing,4,4 July 2001,"The problem with Tomb Raider, is that the character of Lara Croft is perfect.  Great heros are defined by ""Tragic Flaws,"" imperfections or internal conflicts that the hero must overcome in order to better themselves.  This is a standard literary rule.  Now people would say ""Just because it's a rule, doesn't mean it has to be followed.""  I think ""Tomb Raider"" is a prime example of what happens when some rules are broken. 
The essence of drama is conflict, outer and inner.  These are obstacles that the hero must overcome in order to have a story with drama.  It might be considered that the villians in ""Tomb Raider"" create the needed conflict. That the fact that Lara Croft must defeat these villians makes for enough conflist in order for ""Tomb Raider"" to be a succesful movie.  The problem with this position is that the villians in ""Tomb Raider"" didn't pose to much of a threat.  We (the audience) knew before the battle scene even started that Lara Croft would come out victorious, and not only victorious but completely unharmed.  This makes the flashy battle sequences almost a waste of time.  There was never a point in ""Tomb Raider"" where the audience thinks ""Oh my gosh.  Is she gonna make it? I don't know.  I really hope she does."" Now I'm not saying that the hero must lose, only lose enough in order to make the charcter seem like a human being.  Not like some perfect robot that can dessimate anything in her path.  This lack of conflict removed any amount of emotional content that went into the movie.""Tomb Raider"" is a mentally boring film.  It should be only viewed by people who enjoy action and don't care about plot.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

There was obviously some money put into this movie given the nice sets and locations.  But the script/story/directing was just horrible.  I heard that they held off making this movie waiting for a good script... boy, if this is the best script they could come up with I would hate to have seen the others.  The dialog was laughable at points, and the little touches that I guess were supposed to be meaningful or something just came off stupid and out of place.  Even while the action was going on I found myself sighing and hoping it would get better.  There just wasn't enough of a story around the characters (or in general) to make you really care about the film and how it played out.  At one point out of the blue we are tossed a romantic interest for Laura (which previously this guy was a bitter rival) and we are supposed to buy (without any hints as to why) Laura caring about him getting hurt, etc.While I never played the games a ton I am a big fan of Angelina, but I just found myself bored in this movie.  They also seemed to have padded out her bra, which made her boobs look too big and not very real.  Angelina is very hot, and it was a big mistake to mess around with her look like that I think.I hope somehow they make another movie (that has a good story behind it) and Angelina gets another chance to shine in an action flick.

330,cmark51,If only ...,6,18 June 2001,"First thing, I am a big Tomb Raider fan, so a lot of the movie was acceptable to me as a reflection of scenes and situations that occur in the game. Next, if I were going to make a Tomb Raider movie, it would be computer animated (a no-brainer, from my point-of-view). But, they decided to do a live action picture. So, for live actor to play Lara Croft, my first choice was always Elisabeth Hurley - but Angelina Jolie was just fine, she looks great as Lara, and she puts across Lara's ruthless, menacing manner in a way I doubt Hurley could have. So the casting of Jolie was an inspired choice after all. But the story is a muddle, it's true, and there is a clutter of flat and superfluous characters (like, was that Pimms guy there for the product placement, or what?), and some really, really bad plot and character motivation holes - some of which have been detailed by other users, and others I won't go into details about. Any discerning viewer will be more than aware of them. Yes, the action sequences did seem a bit disjointed (no editing Oscars here), the special effects were not what would be called ""groundbreaking,"" but they were fine, and appropriate to the plot - I liked the orrery (even with nine planets - you might figure if the ancient ones could do that time-control thing, maybe they looked ahead and saw Pluto.) So while I was more than prepared for the picture to be complete crap, I was also prepared to enjoy it as much as possible. It's not complete crap, but it is no action-adventure masterpiece either. Buy a biiiiig thing of popcorn when you go. Everything bad and good you might have so far heard about it is true.

YesIt was a very hip flick.  Has a good soundtrack.  Good characters.  Even better outfits. What appeared to me as shortcomings and things that disturbed me about the film I later recognized as the fault of the director.  (And yes I realize some of you all see ""Com-Air"" as the greatest action flick of all time) There seemed to me a few shots that could have worked better (i.e. just before she jumps in the river).  It seemed to me he was perhaps trying to copy John Woo.  Then again, who am I to judge?Anyhow ultra cool flick.  Very sly smile worthy. Very fast paced.  Simple plot. (So us girls don't have to worry our pretty little heads about it.)  I do miss some of the lines used in the promotions such as ""this is where I start to have fun"" and ""I said you would try to kill me"" but the movie worked well without it them.  And I do wish they would have had an actual conversation between Alex and Lara.Their isn't a whole lot of humor nor Die Hard type sympathy for the heroin. It has a rock and roll type attitude.  I do find it fascinating that the girl actually gets to kick butt here. In Matrix, Trinity was allowed to do some shooting, but no fighting and Neo kills more than her 3 to 1. Ripley, of the Alien series, is a lonely heroin of the movies, but she has reservations.  She is driven more by her emotions and the need to survive. G.I.

Best scene is the massive Brahman statue which comes to life and is subsequently killed by a swinging log. The villain, Powell is also very good.

This movie tried to be on the level of Indiana Jonesand the Mummy/Mummy 2 and failed miserably. My husbandturned to me  30 minutes into it and apologized for suggesting wesee it. We did not leave but the movie was in general sopredictable, we could have and would have been no worse off.

341,dead_but_happy,Shudder..,3,5 July 2001,"In these days of ""let the lowest common denominator rule"" I hadn't expected Tomb Raider to be a fantastic movie, however I was hoping it had some elements that didn't insult the ordinary viewers intelligence. I actually hoped it was atleast a well made Indiana Jones ripoff...I was - ofcourse wrong. Tomb Raider is probably the worst movie I have seen all year. It was even worse than Hollow Man!!The characters were flat and the plot was so thin it was a crying shame. There wasn't a scene I didn't predict. Do the producers really think they can cast a buxom lady with huge ammounts of collagen in her lips and expect it to make up for a onedimensional plot? Well, I should have expected all this - we are talking hollywood here..However - the extreme ammounts of comercial in this movie surpassed even the worst I have seen sofar. Tomb Raider was more infomercial than action movie. Obviously sponsored by Gerber, some cellular company I can't recall and World Delivery Express (or something) they did nothing to even make the comercial subtle...Well, with the MTV generation - what can you expect...?On the more positive side - atleast I talked my girlfriend out of going to see Pearl Harbour...",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

344,crosma,Worse film than I previously thought possible,1,5 September 2002,"This film is so clearly bad, I can't believe anything except that Simon West and co. were trying to make a weak film.For the first 20 minutes there're about 10 lines of dialogue, each impossibly horrible. The density of lines increases as the film progresses, but their quality does not. The actors are made to speak in ridiculously unrealistic english accents, which grates (to say the least). Jolie pronouncing ""Uranus"" in the modern American way with her thick fake-english accent can only be described as *confusing*. Of course, this isn't a ""dialogue film"", it's an action film.The action ranges from rudimentary to pathetic. Every shot is either poorly thrown together or a set-piece shot for the trailer. In the first action scene Lara runs around firing pointlessly at a robot, each bullet bounces off, but she continues to run around firing at it like an idiot, with a stupid smirk on her face. Instead of making the audience think Lara can handle herself (obvious intention), it makes her appear like an amature adventurer with no real skill.While this film is quite short, it allows large segments of time to be thrown away with seemingly irrelevant, slow moving scenes, where nothing happens and no-one really says anything.In total there's only about 15 minutes of content here. There aren't many action scenes, but they're all long and boring. There aren't any real dialogue driven scenes. The plot's not particularly interesting. This could easily be editted down to 15 minutes without missing anything.When films are ""stupid"" bad they can be laughed at, and thus enjoyed on a different level. This film can't, because it drags too much. ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" is an awful, pitiful, pathetic, excuse for a movie. At the present time I cannot name a worse film.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

346,watcher-13,"Watch the movie, not the hype",8,6 July 2001,"I read a lot of the comments before I went to see the movie, and as it happens so often, it was a love/hate relationship.  I guess the people in the middle between love it and hate it didn't think it was good enough or bad enough to comment on.  Having only played Tomb Raider a short while and not playing any of the sequels, I didn't have any huge expectations for the movie.  I knew it was an action/adventure movie with AJ in it, and I knew the background behind Tomb Raider but I wasn't a fanatic about.  What I saw was a pretty good movie, I gave it an 8.  It wasn't outstanding, it didn't change my life, it didn't make me want to run out and buy up all of the TR games. It was just a pretty good movie I shelled out $5 for (the matinee) and got what I expected: a pleasant afternoon in some air conditioning watching something enjoyable to pass some time.  I didn't go hoping to alter my life's path, and for those of you who think movies are going to do that for you, they have some really good professional help nowadays you really should look into. For all those who complained about it, I liken you to people who go to a really good steak house and order the only fish dish on the menu and then complain about it.

348,DeepGrey,You should pay the price of a full admission to avoid this movie.,1,21 June 2001,"If you should not see some movies even if ""they"" paid you, for this one you should go even further and pay money to avoid it! Tomb Raider is grotesque parody of a movie, a gross insult thrown to the moviegoers across the world. Action movies are bad nowadays, but Tomb Raider beats everything by its stupidity. There is nothing that could justify such a failure. At least the industry is true to its style and proves that video-to-movie schemes never work (Street Fighter, anyone? Or Wing Commander? At least the last one came with a Star Wars preview). Anyway, back to the Tomb Raider, the plot is non-existent, the actors are flat, the word ""acting"" cannot be associated to this production, the fighting scenes are ridiculous. People, The Matrix was The Matrix, no need to endlessly rip it off, you can't just reproduce it! Even the ""russian"" girl was speaking a terrible russian... could not they hire a real? Conclusion: Run screaming! Or do yourself a favor and see ""Return of the Mummy"" (silly, yet entertaining).",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
349,myownnemesis,Just like the genre...,5,15 June 2001,"Generally, when a movie is made from a video game, it bombs.  This movie is no different.  It relies too much on the game for Lara's development as a character, and that is all it holds true to the game.  In the game she was a rogue, and her father disowned her becuase of her tomb raider-ways.  In the movie, she had help from several others and her father wanted her to be an archeologist(like him).  The action sequences were weak and unbelievable.  Terrible character development.  The ending, not the resolution, was just bad.  Personally I think it would've been a bit better had it alluded to the games(specifically the very first one with the Scion and Atlantis).  It seems the plot of the movie was somewhat based on that, but altered.  The game had an artifact called the Scion which 'gave the holder powers of God himself'.  The abuse of that power led to the downfall of Atlantis.  The Scion was divided and hidden across the earth.  The movie had the Triangle of Light which gave its holder the 'power of God and time'.  The abuse of that power led to the downfall of that city.  The triangle was divided and hidden across the earth.I rate it 5/10.  My suggestion is wait for the movie to come out on video, and just play the games.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
350,mowglisj,Avoid like the plague - Zero Stars.,1,22 May 2002,"No doubt about it.  Angelina Jolie is quite easy on the eyes.  But overall, this movie was one of the hardest movies to watch as I've seen in a long time.I love action-adventure flicks, especially ones set in exotic locations.  I can even tolerate a bit of cheese and sketchy science, if it's done with style. ""Tomb Raider"" has been compared to the ""Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"" movies.  If plagiarism constitutes inspiration, than this movie was quite inspired.  It's an insult to the intelligence; enough to make a five-year-old roll his eyes with disbelief.  Certain scenes and images were practically carbon copies of ""The Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"", but it failed miserably at capturing the charm and wit that made those movies so much fun. Its ludicrous and incongruous ""plot,"" if you can call it that, appears to have been conjured up by a couple of thirteen-year-old potheads... which leads me to believe that this was probably the target audience. 
But what should I expect from a movie based on a video game?  It certainly had all the suspense and intrigue of ""Space Invaders"" and the character development of ""Asteroids"".  And the F/X weren't much better.If you value your time, stay away from this movie.  Don't rent it, don't even watch it when it makes its shameful ""world network premiere"", which is inevitable.  (Of course, no self-respecting network will pick it up, but UPN or FOX might.)  It consumed 100 minutes of my lifespan that I can never regain.

352,oslcool,huge disappointment,6,12 July 2001,"I was hugely disappointed by this film. I really do not know how they manage to mess things up every time they try making a movie out of games or comic books. Remember that sad mario bros movie? of the x-men. Ok with mario bros it was understandable. And the x-men was also very ""fantastic"" so I imagine that could be difficult as well (still a poor excuse for a bad story).But Lara croft, they could have started a whole new line of Indiana Jones type films. But nooooo, babe in tight clothing and a lot of special effects seemed to be all they wanted. The story was ok, secret organization the illuminati and a mysterious power. But they just did not do anything with it, everything is so unbelievable. Angelina looks great in every scene but I kinda expect more from a film. Why would anyone in their right mind decide to hop on a motorcycle to defeat the bad guys when they've got a gun. sure it looks cool but come on!And with all the high tech we see in the beginning you should think they would be able to keep intruders out. I could go on and on, unnecessary special effects, I think it is just sad how they managed to spoil this. If only they had spend more money on the script and less on special effects.I really wonder how ""spiderman"" will be. All this technology and money and still.

Its not supposed to be a drama or supsense-thriller and if thats what you folks are comparing it to, you need to have your heads examined.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
355,kpickette,I was entertained.,7,10 June 2003,"""Tomb Raider"" is a harmless diversion that should please its core audience. I loved the performance of Angelina Jolie, who brings the computer game heroine Lara Croft to life. I watched an interview with Jolie in which she said that she really ""became Lara Croft"".With her mock British accent, Jolie is a lot of fun as the adventurer-archaeologist who is equal parts Bruce Wayne and Indiana Jones, but with a much better body.Taking its cue from the video game, the film's screenplay is more of a puzzle than a plot. The script is a patchwork of ideas that plays like a Greatest Hits collection of other films. It deals with end of the world stuff, but it never feels apocalyptic. It's controlled chaos, utterly lacking in surprise. The script jumps from one expected moment to the next, never apologizing for its lack of originality.At least Jolie understands the limitations of the script. There's enough conviction in her performance to make you want to believe in Lara Croft, the spunky heiress is who is equally at home in her spacious mansion or within the catacombs of a lost tomb. She's guided by the spirit (both literally and figuratively) of her late adventurer father, Lord Croft (Jon Voight), and assisted by an archaeologist Alex West (Daniel Craig) and cyber-geek creator Bryce (Noah Taylor).The film opens like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" with Lara Croft deep inside one of those musty, dusty tombs. Instead of outrunning a giant boulder, Croft squares off against a mechanical monster, a robotic menace that seems to come out of nowhere. It doesn't. We learn that it's a creation of Bryce, used to keep Croft on her toes.Angelina Jolie made the perfect Lara Croft; her facial expressions and sly smirks added a personality to the flick that I can only imagine the video game is missing. She seemed smart, brave, and composed as well as full of emotion. Okay, maybe the parts with her father (real-life papa Jon Voight) were a little over the top, but since the whole movie is just eye-candy anyway they seemed to fit.The fight scenes among ruins got me. How can you not love Lara Croft jumping onto a swinging obelisk to smash a glass eye that holds the key to time, or sledding thru an ice cave being pulled by dogs? Or the scene where the villains jump through her castle windows as she rappels around the walls, smashing chandeliers and pistol-whipping bad guys? What's a girl to do but hop on her motorbike, take a guy out sideways, and race off at 100 miles an hour? Excellent.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

This movie lacks any inspiration and is as interesting as waiting in front of a traffic light. Angelina Jolie seems to have just woken up just before every scene as her eyes are half closed.  She looks extremely scruffy throughout the movie and doesn't even bother to act.

Too bad her talents are totally wasted in this impotent ""action"" flick.  Even by the mediocre standards of this genre, this movie is a total bore.  There is zero character development, plot holes the size of meteor craters, and no originality.  Lara Croft is given little to do except fire her two pistols, fire off lame one liners, and pout her fabulous lips and pose in clingy outfits.  Less demanding young male viewers might say that this is enough for them, but anyone with half a brain will keep checking their watch.  If you're hot for Angelina, rent GIA again.  If you want to see a grrl-power action flick, try Charlie's Angels-- it's a lot more fun.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
360,Vilolyn,Boob Raider,1,16 June 2001,"When movies get made from other forms of media (i.e. video games, comics, books, etc), a clear goal should be established:  Make a film that will appeal to both fans of the original source, and that will not completely alienate new viewers.  This has been done with some consistencey in the past, ""Tomb Raider"" does not fall into this category.
If I took the time to list all the things that were wrong with the movie in relation to the video game, I would be sitting here three days, so I will try to summarize what was accurate.  Her name was Lara Croft, she did some tomb raiding, she was british.  That about covers it.
The plot was horendous, boring, predictable, and generally pointless. These phrases could also be used to describe most of the characters and their acting, I'm not sure whether to blame them or the director on that note. Though I have seen most of the actors give far better performances.  I kept thinking to myself, why didn't they just use the plot from the first game, it would have translated well to the big screen, or at the very least found some writers who could, you know, write.The action sequences were tolerable, I will give it that, though after a while they got a bit tiring and I lost count as to how many times Lara defies the laws of physics, I guess that's a bit consistant with the games, at any rate.Lastly this movie pandered to the worst thing about the Tomb Raider franchise.  Lara Croft's breasts.  Yes, i know, she's attractive, she has breasts that defie gravity and a few other physical constants, but please, get over it, if this is the most interesting part of the Tomb Raider sage, just turn the game into a lame porno flick and get on with your lives, it's not worth wasting our time with bad writing and dialogue just so angelina jolie can flash her breasts to the camera some six hundred times in the span of two hours.To conclude:  As a Tomb Raider fan, this movie made me ill and I feel I wasted six bucks and a quarter on it.  If you're interested in action, rent something with better acting, or play the games, if you're interested in boobs, the adult section is usually to the back of the video store.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
361,mpr3t,Eye candy but little else,5,3 July 2001,"I'm a big fan of Tomb Raider in general and was both happy and disappointed after seeing this movie.  I was relieved that Angelina Jolie did a commendable job of filling Lara Croft's boots.  She did the British accent convincingly, and although she tended to overplay the surly demeanor, she was quite good. The major fault to this film, however, is the infantile plot.  You would think that for a multi million dollar summer blockbuster they would have bothered to hire a writer, but apparently not.  The plot is full of holes (Lara has the key they seek; why not destroy it and prevent the end of the world that way?) and plays like a video game, meaning that it is a thin excuse to move from exotic locale to exotic locale.  The visuals are great, the soundtrack is fun, and overall it's a fun movie.  I could only imagine what a good writer and director could have done with it, though...",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
362,othello676,Make it stop!,1,2 July 2001,"Lord God and all dieties of the universe, how could you let such a film exist?  Is man truly without guidance and nothing more than a selfish and foolish creature?  Surely no wise being responsible for this thing called humanity could let us sink so low as to create an abyss of wretchedness like ""Tomb Raider.""  In this accursed summer of abuses, this dark age of cinema where the masses flock to see the next corporate manifested piece of garbage, ""Tomb Raider"" continues to prove audiences will take a big bite from a rotten, festering sandwich, and not only not complain, but say 'thank you' and ask for more.So-called future star Angelina Jolie takes front stage in her first big-budget starring vehicle and promptly falls asleep on camera.  Her faux British accent barely rises above a whisper.  She's left shooting her pistols repeatedly, while yearning for her long lost Daddums and nothing more.  Jon Voight appears as the Dad, apparently slumming, even for him.The plot, use that term loosely, involves a magic triangle that controls time.  Yes, it is as stupid as it sounds.  This hookum acts as little more than a famework to hang actions scenes on.  The film starts by introducing us to a large set, then promptly destroys it in a hail of gunfire and chaos. Repeat 4 times, fade out.  The special effects in these sequences are largely obvious and bland, the set design familiar of other, better films, and the action itself boring and pointless.  Making matters worse are the dullest villans imaginable.  I kid you not, the main villan spends most of his screen time recieveing a massage.  The rest of the cast is indistinguishable and forgettable.Paramount is already threatening a sequel to this plague.

363,psycho-dj,The best movie adaptation of a video game ever!,9,9 December 2001,"I am a big fan of the Tomb Raider video games, and always thought it would be cool if they made a movie out of it.  Then when I heard they were making a movie, I thought the most difficult thing would be to find the right actress to play Lara Croft.  For anyone who's played the game would know that those are some difficult shoes to fill, but  Oscar winner Angelina Jolie successfully did that.  I can't imagine anyone else who could have. As for the film itself, well, I was quite impressed with it from beginning to end.  I've never really been an action film fan, because they're usually mindless and overloaded with special effects which bury any possible story there.  Tomb Raider, like most other action films, didn't really have much of a storyline, but since I didn't expect it to, I wasn't disappointed. Instead, I was in awe over the successful bringing of the game to life. Unlike many other movie adaptations of video games, Tomb Raider wasn't cartoonish looking or silly.  To me it came across as real, but still having the fantasy element.  I was impressed with how Jolie pulled off being Croft and not just looking like her.  Since Jolie did most of her stunts, it was impressive to see her move and jump and flip and fight like Lara does in the game. I also have a lot of respect for Jolie for taking this role, since a lot of other Oscar winners stay with the stuffy Oscar-worthy roles. I'd also like to add that although many see Lara Croft as the ""female Indiana Jones"" or the female equivelent to other action heroes, I feel that she is an action hero of her own.  She may posess some similar qualities, but she's still unique, and I don't think there's anyone else like her.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The answer in short is NO.  Tomb Raider is not an awful film, it's just not a very exciting one.  The movie begins with Lara practising against some massive robot, dull, we would have rather seen her completing a mission or something.   The story is just not up to scratch, the cut scenes in the computer game have better direction and storyline.  Simon West may have made Con Air, a movie that I like, but he does nothing with this, slow mo on action scenes is daft.  All the cast apart from Angelina and Chris Barrie are no good.

371,Outlaw-16,The right formula done very wrong!,4,15 June 2001,"First off, I'm a big Tomb Raider video game fan, so I was awaiting this film for some time.  When I heard they casted Angelina Jolie, I thought they are making the right choices for cast -- this is where all the positives for this stop.  The negatives:  Simon West as director -- he is a man that makes a living making really bad films; so, why not let him direct one of the summer's biggest movies?  Makes sense in Hollywood terms.  Instead of getting some director who is established in making good epic action films, like a Martin Campbell, we chose someone that is only known for John Malkovich's overkill death scene in CON AIR.Negative #2.  Who are these people writing the screenplay?  Instead of giving the script to someone like John August to doctor it up, we chose a bunch of people with some or no experience is writing screenplays.  I felt the script was the biggest letdown of the entire movie.  Why does it seem that Hollywood focuses on getting actors attached, getting the financing, find the director, and then after they hire a key grip, they begin with the screenplay?  I have worked in the film business for some time and I still don't understand this logic.Remarkably, I didn't have a problem with the actors.  They seemed to do the most they could given the script and direction.  A nice note was seeing Noah Taylor in a big budget film.  Instead of seeing this movie, maybe you should go rent two of Noah's better films, THE YEAR MY VOICE BROKE and FLIRTING.Let's hope that TOMB RADIER II will start in the right direction by replacing the director and screenwriters and firing the Head of Development at Mutual Film Company, the production company that gave you this poor excuse of a film.My God, will someone please watch RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and take a few notes!!!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
372,fbeauvais,Yet Another ''As Expected'' Movie,5,18 June 2001,"Action packed but disappointing filmOne word : action.  Yeah there were some in it but unfortunately that was really lacking of fun and originality.  Scenes were badly mixed with others, giving the movie a weak rhythm.  Worse ! Some of the sequence have been simply missed, coarsely cut by the director.  And, not to forget, some of the 3D backgrounds and animation appears so cheap !  On the story side, Tomb Raider is more a ''collage'' of other movies : a lot of Indiana Jones, a bit of Star War and believe it or not, a lot of The Mummy !!!  All along till the end, characters will subtly try to tell us what is the secret of the ''Illimunaty'' and what is about the secret triangles but it also doesn't stick. Script is humour-free and characters were lacking of credibility. Angelina Jolie were shining trhought on some of the scenes but she were simply too much highlitted...  Movie was all on her ''breast'' and it seem in the end she can't handle it, maybe due to a lack of personality and support from the script.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I was hoping to see a silly-fun movie that would entertain me for a few hours.  Well, Tomb Raider is silly, but it's not fun, or entertaining.  It's just boring, dull, tedious, brainless...etc.  The dialogue seems to have been taken from a million other movies (the same goes for the action scenes), and the plot, needless to say, is utterly cliqued and predictable.  I remember going to see Gone In Sixty Seconds last year, and feeling similarly let down by that as well.  But at least Sixty Seconds was fun.

I love the fact that she wears a tight t-shirt and thin overcoat, while the hardened mercenaries are all wearing heavy parkas (wimps).  Great special effects that weren't over the top or there because the technology was available.

This load of complete garbage is nothing but a ""Mid riff"" who wears push up bras and shows cleavage while saying half assed dialogue from a script that is so mindless it has the mental stimulation capabilities of a ""I'm with stupid shirt"". The action scenes are a COMPLETE hack from other movies such as Mission Impossible 2 and various others. Also, the fact that she gets in a damn shower within the first 5 minutes also displays the pure immaturity of this atrocity. I swear, I would understand the fact that little perverted kids would watch this load of garbage simply because of the fact that Anga watchmacall her is wearing well, almost nothin. But once again, older mature adults disappoint me once again seeing as how they actually approve this overhyped junk. You shell out your hard made dollars to watch this garbage yet completely ignore the greats ""Requiem For a Dream"", ""rocky horror picture show"", and ""evil dead 2"".

387,Riddler-4,A praise for the film and criticism for those who hated it.,9,24 June 2001,"Despite the horrible reviews it's receiving (surprisingly, Ebert enjoyed this flick), Tomb Raider proves that video game based movies can find the balance between content and action.  Unlike the dark and grimy Super Mario Brothers or the overdone and poorly written Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Tomb Raider maintains the feel of the video games and adds the content a movie needs.  I was especially surprised with the storyline; I came expecting a fight fest with minimal characters and trite one-liners. Instead I see a tough as nails woman with a soft side, a devious enemy with an obsession, and a lover that Lara can't let go.  Oh, and two token characters that didn't add or detract from the movie (which, along with a couple slow scenes, made me give this film a 9).  The story does clash slightly with the plot in the games, since Lord Croft was alive when Lara was in her late teens, but no more than can be expected.  The music was appropriate, fast and intense when needed.  All these elements combined made the experience feel less like watching a video game (which is what I expected) and more like a base movie that an exciting and fun-filled franchise can develop from. Now, addressing all the people who criticize this movie, I say ""Come on! Did you come expecting Gladiator?  Paramount asserted that this film would be an action flick and West delivered.  Jolie demonstrates a versatility from drama to action with smooth Croft-like confidence, adding to her repertoire.  Sure the CGI's weren't fantastic, but it was still eye-candy and entertaining to see.  Of course some of the stuff that happens is incredible - have you even played the games?  They have her shooting walking mummies and pushing 8-ton statues on a regular basis.  You don't come to a movie like Tomb Raider expecting a gripping story with authenticity and believability; you go to see an action-packed adventure that doesn't maim the game characters you enjoy, and that is what Tomb Raider does.  Lara was still Lara, only with a new look (black outfit, instead of blue and khaki). She still kicked ass, was trigger-happy, and was highly erotic without trying.  And it had serious action, with a refreshing amount of plot.  How you could view this movie as terrible is beyond me, unless you've never seen the games, were asleep, or really, really hated The Mummy.""",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Not bloodless in the Leonard Maltin sense, though; bloodless as in lifeless.  As in DOA.  As in BORING!

If you're looking  movie or one which makes sense don't go, but if you're just looking to have a fun romp with great action scenes and aren't offended that the movie uses Jolie's breasts to sell tickets.

Because of some really cool, beautiful shots, nice locations and a rather ok direction by Simon West (I really liked his first two features). The problem with this film is not the direction, not the actors (nor the cast), not even the story. The problem with the film is it's scipt. Stupid, foreseeable dialogue, way too unrealistic (as unrealistic as Charlie's Angels was) and sometimes it was just dumb, lack of action and stupid use of dumb special effects.

However, This movie has such a weak overdone story line that it can not be considered exciting in anyway. The lead character played in an uplifting way (wink wink) by Angelina what's her name does not garner any sympathy from the viewer. Kind of like the video game character.The writers struggle to give her some character and even get her tired looking real life father Jon Voight to play an even more tired cliche Yoda role.Like the restless teeny boppers in the row in front of me, I tried to get into the movie but the snack bar and movie posters in the lobby seemed to be more interesting.Normally I'm not above shushing unruly movie goers, but I really couldn't blame the kids in the audience for getting restless.That's why I rated this movie only 2 push up bras out of a possible 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

But Angelina's portrayal was great, she nailed lara croft perfectly(although i still would have preferred a recreation by Elizabeth Hurley). Some problems that were ran into though were by people that I know weren't videogame fanatics. One of my friends that I saw this movie with was not familiar with tomb raider outside of watching me play it a few minutes on my PC, did not understand the movie. It wasn't the story or situation, but the general purpose of one artifact leading to another, and things like that.

As an audience, I expect a more thrilling scene after the breath-taking struggle in Cambodian Tomb.The body shape and stylish outfit of Lara is pleasing to watch.

All over the front are quotes from reviewers claiming all sorts of things which after viewing this film aren't very believable. This film was extremely over rated and incredibly self indulgent. Just because you put some heart pumping tech-no grunge music to Angelina running around a giant room while attached to strings and destroying absolutely everything she owns doesn't make it exciting. These sorts of scenes became repetitive and annoying as every action sequence was unoriginal and all done before.Jolie on the other hand fitted the character rather well, physically that is. The character which is portrayed in the film is nothing like the one which existing in the game. She is to butch and over the top and doesn't hold the elegance of computer game character.

However, by the end of the film it was obvious that the men in her life (her father, her potential love interest, and the Big Bad Guy) were the motivation for her actions. That, combined with the shameless way her body was put on display (here I refer directly to the hackneyed shower scene, included for the sole purpose of exciting the prurient interest of the teen-age males in the audience) puts Lara Croft far outside the reaches of the strong female action character she could have been. (Think Ellen Ripley in the ""Alien"" series.) Hollywood needs to learn that female characters can have strength of character which is not directly linked to their sexuality.

Yes, even worse than Spy Kids, worse than See Spot Run, worse than A Knight's Tale. The bad acting and writing is mostly just icing on the cake. The worst is the shameless product placement (Mr. Pibb, Cherry Pepsi, UPS, Aston Martin, Erickson Cell Phones, Wonderbra, more than likely Bloussant, and of course the Tomb Raider video game) and the blatent rip offs of at least fourteen movies. The most obvious of these being Indiana Jones and The Mummy. It was almost as if they spliced the movies together, gave Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser breasts, then threw in the genius that was needed to create Josie and the Pussycats.I would highly recommend just renting both Indiana Jones and The Mummy instead of watching this piece of tripe.Oh, the guy who plays Book Boy (you'll know him when you see him) was kind of good. He's the guy who looks like Lowell from the show ""Wings"".

Combined with Jolie they manage to pull this up from the sewer. Just don't expect miracles and you shouldn't be disappointed. Think Indiana Jones with a bust and a worse script and just accept it as that.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
413,Pscribe,The Perfect Laura....the Worst Script,3,15 June 2001,"While Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast (and endowed) for the part, the storyline most certainly is juvenile.  If not for a little girl's idealistic perception of her father this movie would have ended soon after the first major action sequence.  Laura is supposed to be extremely intelligent, yet is impulsive and childish. The CGI was adequate at best though a few moments destroyed all the good work that they did in other scenes.  ie. Laura and her nemesis are running up this horrible image of a pryramid which looks as if it were pulled from an 8 bit nintendo game. This movie is another in what will be a long line this summer of flics that do not come close to living up to their billing.  3 out of 10.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
414,sprets2000,A Fun Adventure,10,18 June 2001,"This movie is obviously not intended to be taken seriously. The film is very good, but not as fun as The Mummy Returns. However, it does have dialogue, thought the critics are saying it doesn't. And here is a warning to everyone: there is not an action scene every five minutes! They come well spaced out, like in the fun X-Men. It leaves room for more development and normally a better movie. Though this may be less deep than Moulin Rouge, it is still a fun summer blockbuster that should be watched while eating salty popcorn; you cannot walk into the theatre expecting a mind blowing oscar contender.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
415,vicciv,Stays true to the game,8,16 June 2001,"One of the diciest parts about going to see a movie based on a game is the translation of the feel of the game to the screen.  Tomb Raider does an excellent job of this, giving those of us die-hard game players a ""right-at-home"" kind of feeling.  Don't go looking for deep plot or complex subtext.  This movie is all about action.  And, the center of it all is Angelina Jolie, who really makes us believe that she is Lara Croft.The supporting cast does not always live up to her, but some of them truly shine, such as the urbane butler Henry and the roguish ""love"" interest Alex. But the main focus is always on Lara and that's the way it should be.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
416,justinrusso,Maybe theres isnt such a thing as a good video game movie.,1,16 June 2001,"Following in the footsteps that Street Fighter and Double Dragon left for it, Tomb Raider sucked. From a plot so ridiculous it wouldnt even show up in a Bruce Campbell movie, to John Voight who hasnt made a good movie in years. It all starts out seemingly intresting as Lara Croft runs around a mock tomb shes built in her house, being chases by her training robot. A ridiculous idea in the first place, as I have yet to actually see such a versatile robot ever exsist in reality. But what am I complaining about reality for when the plot centers around time travel. Tomb Raider plays like a sitcom, with one obvious plot and loads of ridiculous sub plots. It seems like Mutual Films got tons of writer in one room together and didnt let them out until they had a screenplay. Its seems so tired and contrived, and ridiculously easy to follow. From the first few moments of the movie, you know how its going to end and how its going to get there. Anyways, back the story. After the opening gunfest, Lara takes a shower (perhaps the most promising scene in the movie, buts is quickly killed by her damn butler). After the shower I dont remember much else because I was punching my head in disgust. But it can be summed up like this: A secret society needs to find two missing pieces of a triangle by the time the planets align. The bad guys toadie steals some dumb clock from lara and uses it to find the pieces. Lara gets a note from her dead dad that tells he to destroy the stones. Which she does, but only after attempting to retrieve her father from before he disappeared. The mains things I found wrong with the movie: -If an ancient race hid the two pieces on opposite ends of the world, wouldnt the temprature and all around look of the places be the same. kind of like the north pole is alot like the south pole because they are on opposite ends of the world. -John Vought should just stop. -What they hell was the thing with the big black pyramid? -Why would you go back in time to get your dad? He's just gonna die again. He won't live forever no matter how much you want him too.i could go on but, i dont want to take up anymore of your time, i leave you with this adivce. DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
417,Lord_Drukore,A Waste of Film,1,23 June 2001,"Going into this movie, I KNEW it was based off a videogame, and have both played it and watched people playing it. This being said, on to the review.Simply put, Tomb Raider was a very bad movie, with a poorly written plot was written horribly, and other than Jolie's performance, the rest of the actors gave very poor performances.The Plot: The Illuminati(sp), a great, secret organization that can be used in conjunction with a number of plots. In Tomb Raider they were nothing more than a collection of aging old men afraid to die.The Power of the Light: Gives its controller mastery over time, so many possibilities. Its used to give Lara a brief reunion with her father, then allows her to save the life of someone she despises before being destroyed. 1. She obsessed with her father much more than any mentally healthy person should be. Risking the destruction of the world to bring him back...thats not Lara Croft. 2. She manipulates time to save the life of someone she despises...again not Lara Croft.The Action Scenes: Predictable, uninteresting, and badly constructed. I was closer to falling asleep during the action scenes than any other part of the movie.The Villain: Completly lacking the most basic villain qualities. He would have fit better as a shifty ally of Lara than her main adversary.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

419,Paolo01,Great potential fizzles,5,16 June 2001,"First, let me say that I have never played Tomb Raider.  I am not a video game junkie and have never lusted over the digital Lara Croft.  That being said, I was looking forward to the movie, and expecting something along the lines of Raiders of the Lost Ark with a beautiful heroin.  Bottom line is that there is scarcely a story in this film.  There is a great deal of talk about a clock that provides a diversion to allow Angelina to skip across the continents in search of her father.  There is no real sense of adventure that is ever built up and no story to back up the sets that are thrown at us.  Aside from watching the heroin romp around in spandex there is nothing to draw the viewer into this film or make them cheer.  I was not expecting a classic to be born here, but entertainment would have been nice.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
420,brodie__bruce,Tomb Raider disappoints high expectations,5,13 June 2001,"""Tomb Raider"" seemed like a sure-fire blockbuster to me. Big budget...big stunts...Angelina Jolie's big...ummmm...guns. Unfortunately, I was let down last night when I had the chance to catch an early preview of the film. The supporting cast is ridiculously misused. Chris Barrie (some may know him from the tv series ""Red Dwarf"" as the annoying Rimmer, or from the tv series ""The Brittas Empire"" as the sniveling Brittas) surely was underused in his role as Lara Croft's butler. The movie was one action scene after another. What little plot line did exist, was negated by the fact that nothing is ever really explained clearly, and the film is so choppy, you feel as though they cut out all of the scenes containing any information that might push the story to the next level, in favor of keeping all of the action sequences...of which only a few of them are decent enough to remember past the time you walk out of the theatre. The villain is hardly villainous, and you never doubt the fact that Lara Croft will actually beat him in the end. The acting is ham-handed for the most part. The soundtrack is sufficient in supplying appropriate mood music, but just about everything else falls flat. (it would have been easy to go for a cheap joke there...) It is worth seeing at least once, but you should definitely wait until it comes out on dvd to get the extra features, which should help explain to us moviegoers how a film with so much potential could turn into such a malodorous piece of c**p.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
421,jpaigej,Angelina was great!,10,19 June 2001,I thought the movie was great. I have seen a lot of reviews that have totally knocked the movie. You have to go in there and take it for what it is... a movie based on a video game not some amazing life altering master piece. Just a couple of hours of entertainment with Angelina playing the action hero.... kicking butt! It was a good movie... I thought well done and yeah most things are not realistic but hey it is BASED ON A VIDEO GAME. The makers and actors of Tomb Raider did a great job.

423,jasonvm,Tomb Raider the movie is better than the PC because you don't get stuck!!!,7,20 June 2001,"Tomb Raider is awesome!!!  I watched the movie with the same energy as I did playing the game on PC.  Action is high throttle with Angelina playing a tough yet sophisticated Brit.  The look of all the characters and the sets are incredible.  I thought Simon West said he didn't play the game!!!  The moves of Lara are amazingly similar to the game that I was pratically acting like a kid pointing to the screen and leaning over to my girlfriend saying ""this is soooooooo coooooool."" I expected the movie to be completely different from the game, which takes many nights to play in itself.  Changes in the transition include eliminating deadly traps and including a techno soundtrack compared to a symphonic.  It's all good.  I actually bought the CD before seeing the movie since I own TR II, III, Last Revelation, and Chronicles.  I asked my girlfriend, who adores Angelina what she thought after the movie.  She said it was ok, and wouldn't recommend it.  She didn't understand the scenes with the children at first.  I told her it was the supernatural mix about her father.  Simon said he would differentiate the film from the other Indy and Mummy movies with modern gadgetry and a kick-ass female lead.  My girlfriend didn't like The Mummy Returns either.  She said the movie is for guys just as the game is for guys with Lara shaking her bootie.  She'd rather watch Gone in 60 Seconds over and over since she's into cars and not video games.  I hope that gives the females a perspective.  I, on the other hand, LOVE Tomb Raider.  Go see it.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Ninety minutes of explosions and gunfights by the bungee jumping, sunglass wearing, gun slinging, snobby rich girl, who could audition for the next Indiana Jones or Batman flic.Pick an in the now star, have her portray a character from a popular video game, dress her up in revealing attire, make your quick million and run from the box office.  Man, I'm in the wrong line of work.Regarding the revealing attire, my girlfriend and I remarked that while trekking through the arctic, Miss Croft was the only one we could confirm was wearing a T-shirt !Anyway, if you're into action and fictional stunts, then you'll find this movie entertaining.

426,jct-60772,A little more or less good movie,6,4 February 2021,"I don't have any problems with the movie's action sequences, storyline and others. But the musical score was the only issue. Graeme Revell is a great composer, and. I know he didn't mean to make the film's score sound so bad than he did on Titan A.E. I dig his electronic and orchestral elements to the film, but then lots of stock music by Dick DeBenedictus or others throws the film off. It was because since the other composers, such as Michael Kamen or John Powell, are unavailable to compose, the director gets Revell as his last minute choice. My advice for people creating a media project; don't wait until the last minute to pick which person can compose the score for you. Pick the composer who is excellent and experienced to sound exciting and originally dramatic. I'm relieved that one of my favorite composers, Alan Silvestri, compose the score for the sequel, the Cradle of Life. So I pick the sequel, better.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

It was silly how Lara was darting about the room shooting the hell out of this robot and then put in Lara's party mix. Once i saw that i knew i was on a downward hill.

(Usually the movie version is terrible but I'm still waiting...) I have played all the Tomb Raider games and so when the film version came out, I was nervous. I was afraid that Angelina Jolie would destroy the female-indiana-jones we all know as Lara Croft. Surprisingly, it wasn't freaky-lips' acting that made me loathe this film. Movies, whether they're about nuclear war or videoames, need to grab your attention right at the beginning and hold it. Within the first five minutes of the movie (and i am being literal) I wanted the robot to crush her so I wouldn't have to watch anymore. The director seems to have just graduated from  film school, the robot was absolutely ridiculous and Jolie herself gave too much of a bitchy air to the character. If you were patient enough to watch another few minutes (like I regrettablly did) you'd loathe the other two characters we were introduced to. Lara has lots of guns; couldn't she put the guy out of his misery. This movie is bubble gum but not the fun,campy, juicy bubblegum movie. It's a nasty pre-chewed hunk of poorly made Thrills gum stuck on the bottom of a nasty pair of reboks. This was ten minutes of my life I will never get back.

430,JackSparrow84,"A somewhat flawed, but entertaining popcorn flick",7,5 May 2006,"When it was announced that the popular video game series ""Tomb Raider"" was to be made into a film, I was all excited. When it debuted, it was well received at the box office, but the film did not come without flaws. Angelina Jolie is the perfect Lara Croft for the live action movie. Her face, body (aside from smaller boobs), and lips do resemble the Lara of the games. Her British accent is unbelievable as well. Her supporting cast in the film is OK, though it is obvious that some characters were not treated with more respect. Chris Barrie is hilarious as Hilary, Lara Croft's butler. Noah Taylor is great as Bryce. And John Voight is fantastic, as always. Iain Glen's villain, Manfred Powell, is over the top, and this really doesn't fit a live action film. It is almost laughable. The story is fascinating, with a lot of the game action and mystery. The slow mode camera shots are not a favorite of mine, and both the Lara shower scene and Alex West's shower scene were not needed for the film in any way. Still, it accomplished what it set out to do, be a fun, action adventure. Don't take it seriously is my advice. It's great for what it is.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
431,label-lover,Ridiculous? Yes. Nonsensical? Yes. Bad? Far from it!,8,26 January 2016,"I simply can't take any review seriously that takes the two existing Lara Croft films seriously. Tomb Raider and The Cradle of Life are my favourite guilty pleasure films of all time. They don't deserve to be called ""so bad it's good"", because they are NOT bad. Ridiculous? Yes. Nonsensical? Yes. Bad? Far from it! They are entertaining blockbusters that exist to put all other video-game to movie adaptations to-shame (I mean, there's not much in terms of competition, but still TO-SHAME).I am totally biased though, Lara Croft was the first female character I was exposed to that I could finally relate to. I was nine when I first saw Tomb Raider and The Cradle of Life in one sitting after having a furious marathon of the games on my PC, PS1 and PS2 (the only reason I begged my parents for a PC in the first place was so I could play Tomb Raider, all the cool girls in school were playing Tomb Raider. They should see me now, I too, am a cool girl). But back to Lara Croft in film; seeing her come to life (wake me up) was utterly magical. I couldn't imagine a more perfect actress to play the Croft than early 00's Angelina Jolie.I feel like people want to trash this movie so bad because they can't quite understand why they enjoy this movie so much given all of its plot holes and over the top stunts. I say; don't be afraid, be free, learn to love, give in to your temptations and admit that the Lara Croft films are spectacularly ridiculous.""Did I enjoy the movie? Yes. Is it up there with the Indiana Jones pictures? Was I filled with suspense? No. Since I had no idea what was going to happen, should happen, shouldn't happen or what it meant if it did happen, I could hardly be expected to care. But did I grin with delight at the absurdity it all? You betcha."" – Roger Ebert",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
432,Wayans,"Useless, so very, very useless",1,23 June 2001,"I just recently saw the Tomb Raider movie and simply put, it was horrendous. I am a fan of the Tomb Raider game series and I think Angelina Jolie is a pretty good actress, but this movie was simply atrocious, forget all the special effects, and the action, and the movie is absolutely useless. And even the special effects and action really leave a lot to be desired, the only two good action scenes are at the beginning of the movie and towards the middle in her mansion, and even then they have been set up to be semi-family friendly, so they for an audience used to Matrix style action, this is nothing more then a second thought. The special effects were okay but nothing to write home about, other movies out this summer such as Final Fantasy, Shrek, Jurassic Park Three and even A.I would probably be better eye candy. However, despite its shortcomings in special effects and action, the thing I just cant get past is the PITIFUL acting and scripting. Angelina Jolie and John Voight's horrible attempts at British accents are less then convincing, and between the two of them, I either heard small one liners or wonderfully overdone clichéd ""moral"" quotes. The sad thing is that they were the two best actors of the bunch, the rest of the cast was even more useless, of course that doesn't surprise me as I didn't recognize anyone else in the cast, which speaks volumes of the acting caliber in the film, I'm sure that the only reason that Angelina even thought to star in this film was that the computer geek producers threw pots of money at her because she looks like Laura Croft and is well know, which is about the only reason that 80% of the people above 16 years old and male went for, sadly I'm one of them, and I was utterly disappointed. The one last thing lacking in this movie is a plot. I know that for this movie I'm meant to suspend my disbelief but I simply couldn't, the premise of her adventure is simply absurd, The Mummy and The Mummy Returns is probably more historically accurate. And worse still is the fact that it is VERY unlike the game in the sense that she NEVER encounters animals, for those who don't know, in the Tomb Raider video games, she almost ALWAYS is confronted with ANIMALS that she must fight. In this movie she only fights people, a giant robot, and stupid stone monsters very reminiscent of the indestructible mummy guards from The Mummy(a movie I might add I think this movie stole many concepts from). No where does she meet an animal! So overall if you are looking for an action thriller with a plotline as involving as the Matrix, don't see this film. If you are looking for a cheap action flick with some kicks, again, don't see this film. If you are looking for a film with a useless script, a plot which leaves too much to the imagination, and poor acting by all, then by all means, see this movie that I just wasted ten bucks on!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Maybe I missed the whole point, having never ""played the game"", but that is no reason to make a film with the worst script and dialogue imaginable, spoon-feeding the audience the plot points, and villains that are no more threatening than a small dog. Might as well just show various shots of Angelina Jolie for the duration, and cut the so called story. The only good thing about this movie was that it ended!

The dialogue is horrendous, and the explanations in the movie boggle me with how incredibly generic and lame they are.

436,jrcjr1072,"Bummer, I was hoping for better... (spoilers within)",2,6 July 2001,"I gave this movie a 2 because it had an excellent production design(sets, props, costumes, weapons, etc) and maybe one or two original(or mostly original) fight scenes.
Once again, Hollywood churns out an adult movie premise with childlike execution. Sure it's nice to see a female hero, but come on, what's with the disparity in character? She was raised upper crust, loves her daddy, but seems to have a total disdain for her peers(shooting at or near her butler, treating her techie with disdain, and kicking up her feet at an auction). Hello? Hollywood? Can we make some female leads that aren't cookie-cutter Xena-alikes? You know, snobby, sassy, permanent PMS types. Okay, I must admit that Lara Croft wasn't quite that bad, but close enough to get on my nerves.
It's not like I walked into the theater with high hopes. I just wanted to see an entertaining movie. But I knew from the first scene that I wasn't going to enjoy the movie. Why? Because Lara Croft couldn't hold her guns straight. She actually let (not the barrels) but the trajectories of barrels cross. Probably because the actress' wrists weren't really strong enough to hold the guns steady. I'm nitpicking, you say? Well, I may just be a tad too smart for my own suspension of disbelief. But there you have it, to make a great movie, Hollywood has to do its damnedest to suspend the disbelief of even those few people out here that know two bullets smacking into each other in mid-flight is really dangerous even though it's just a movie and they're really just actors/actresses firing blanks.
On to technical aspects of the plot, I found that this movie borrowed heavily from other movies, but not so badly that fixes here and there wouldn't have warranted a better rating. One of those fixes concerns the 'dead zone' around the lost city/crater at the end of the movie.
If laptops and internal combustion engines don't work in the dead zone, then why do fully automatic machineguns and laser sights? A gun and an internal combustion engine work on the exact same chemistry and physics:--Gun: A volatile substance(gunpowder) burns at an accelerated rate, pushing a mass(bullet/casing/action), the action moves back, ejecting the casing, then the action returns by spring.--Engine: A volatile substance(gasoline) burns at an accelerated rate, pushing a mass(piston), the piston turns a crankshaft, returning its neighboring piston into the same position as it previously occupied.Given the attributes of the deadzone as laid out by the amphibious craft and the laptop, nothing should have worked inside, fires shouldn't have burned, the guns shouldn't have worked, the laser sights and bioluminescence glowsticks shouldn't have worked, the spring in the switchblade shouldn't have propelled the blade forward, the bell shouldn't have rang, voices shouldn't have been heard and the model of the solarsystem shouldn't have turned. In fact, the edge of the dead zone should have KILLED HUMANS ON CONTACT!!!!Why? Well, let me ask you this: What the hell is the difference between a cell in a human body burning glucose and a gun burning gunpowder? None, it's the same chemistry, the same physics.--Human: A volatile(hey, it's a relative term) substance(glucose) burns at a slow rate, allowing muscles to do work, and the body to maintain a 98.6 degree Fahrenheit temperature(37 degrees Centigrade/ 310 degrees Kelvin).Okay, I would have settled for them having to use torches instead of the biolights, and leaving all conventional weaponry behind(yes, even the switchblade).Second biggest plot snafu: Destroying the triangle-thingy with a bullet. I wish I had my 'Shooter's Bible' around so I could look up the muzzle velocities and energy values of various pistol rounds, but I'll take a wild guess from memory and say that no pistol develops an energy rating of more than 3000 ft/lbs at the muzzle. Okay, so let's say a 300 pound wrestler wearing iron-shod shoes jumps from 10 foot high and lands on the triangle-thingy without bending his knees, he breaks it, right? Yeppers(well, okay, lets be fair and subtract for the shock absorbing value of each cartilage pad between each vertebra in his spine, and again for the skin of his soles, but 11 feet definitely makes it!). 3000 footpounds of force generated. And you're trying to tell me that the ancients couldn't break this thingy with whatever tools they had at their disposal, but a girl with a gun can? Are you starting to see why I haven't enjoyed a movie in years? Hollywood doesn't understand that it can't break the laws of physics in a serious movie. When it finally realizes this, we'll have a smarter, faster, better Hollywood, and smarter, faster, better movies.THE END
What?!? I'm not going to gripe about little Lara Croft getting the MASSIVE pendulum to swing faster to puncture the water vessel by simply rocking her bottom instead of running from one end to the other sprint-style, or the fact that I got up to go to the bathroom while she was standing on top of the waterfall and KNEW she was going to jump, or about the bullets taking out the stone guardians as easy as they did, or the fact that Lara broke down the wall of the secret room and nobody came to find out what the noise was about.Nope, these things I merely cringed at and tried to wipe them from my mind so I could enjoy the rest of the film.

439,jcutright,Can Angelina Jolie's boobs make a bad movie good?,5,19 June 2001,"Well, unfortunately, no.  But, director Simon West sure as hell tries. Tomb Raider's plot was ridiculously stupid.... full of plot holes, completely predictable, and constantly defying logic.  Add to this, Angelina Jolie defying physics and gravity every 5 minutes and participating in ridiculously unrealistic action sequences.  Oh, did I mention there were about 10,000 breast shots (not bare, unfortunately).  I think Mr. West new he was working with a sub-par script for a sub-par film and tried to spice it up with shot after shot of Jolie's chest.... to the point of stupidity. Hell, they had her running around in the ice and snow in a tight, sleeveless top!  Now, don't get me wrong, I like boobs as much as the next guy (probably more), but, I think, the gratuitous breast shots detracted from the film more than it helped it.  It just makes you realize what they had to resort to the get an audience.  Because, Tomb Raider, sans Jolie's breasts, could not stand on it's merits alone. Ms. Jolie does try to make the most of a poor film during her obligatory ""emotional"" scenes, but falls short. Overall, a bad movie. Do not waste your money at the theaters, but it's worth a look on video.I want to rate this film lower, but I can't.

440,CJHammond,A misfired attempt to compensate a small story with a big bust,5,2 July 2001,"The producing staff chose the right leading actress for this film. Actually, this decision made the best of this bad job. If Angelina Jolie hadn't taken part in this production, I would have voted this movie a total pratfall (but so, I still gave 5/10).What actually did the story book writers had in mind when they forgot about all these thrilling game scenes, just where the picture is accompanied with a tensing music. Instead, they made this movie a techno party -- Lara's Party mix, to be precise!I couldn't believe it! Think! They had five! complete game stories to learn from -- And yet, they weren't able to build up only one to make a movie worth watching of. To give you some examples, here's my personal flop five:1. This sob-stuff about her father being a ""bad boy"" -- but converting to the ""good boys"" is so canned and dull, I just can't stand it2. Did you notice, that apart from A. Jolie there wasn't any other female part of importance in this production -- A little too single-edged for my taste3. It is a very surprising fact to me that Alex Cross (played by Daniel Craig) is such a patsy, only being capable of blaming Lara for doing a bad job although he's the one being too dumb to find the right keyhole!4. Unfortunately, Iain Glen (Manfred Powell) plays his part a bit too perfectly. I don't believe him not being troubled by the situation at the council of his picky club5. The scene, where Lara and Powell race for the magic device is far too short. It is the key to all what happened before -- which could have been told in about 30 minutes! --, yet, after 3 seconds everything is settled, finallyI feel deeply sorry for all fans of Lara who were eagerly waiting to see this movie. It's absolutely not worth affording a ticket!My personal consequence is plain: If there shall be a sequel, I'll wait for it to be released on DVD. At least, then I can enjoy the good scenes and skip the crap...",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

442,ShortestFrame,Back into the tomb!,1,11 June 2002,"I wasn't expecting too much when I rented this wannabe-entertainer from my local video store, because in the past video game material put on the screen never turned out to be a real cinematic pleasure. But after having seen Simon West's ""Tomb Raider"" starring the undeniable attractive Angelina Jolie I must confess that I shouldn't have expected ANYTHING!Everyone who criticized ""Final Fantasy"" for being an overblown, senseless and emotionless video game disguised as a 2-hour-action-flick has to watch West's brave attempt to deliver a film that easily ranks among the three worst I've ever seen! In comparison to ""TR"" the animated ""Final Fantasy"" and even the ""Pokemon""-films look like potential Oscar-Nominees for ""Best Picture"". And putting Lara Croft on the same stage with Indiana Jones as the modern female adventure heroine really seems like an insult on the reputation of Lucas' and Spielberg's masterpiece.To be fair, no one expected ""TR"" to have a strong storyline and in-depth character development - if you bought tickets for ""TR"" you bought them for action and a sexy Angelina. Well, honestly, you get both of it. Nevertheless, the result is an annoying, ultimate failure due to several reasons:The audience wanted action, West gave them action. The problem is that ""TR"" moves along with such a breakneck pace that it's impossible to find ANY plot in this exploding mess. The film jumps from one exotic location (or should I say LEVEL!?!) to the next, leaving the viewer with the feeling of a noisy and spectacular slideshow that is connected by constantly unbearable dialogue. Soon, you'll get tired of all this crash-boom-bang because there's hardly anything new in it. And when the time has come that West tries to reveal some melodramatic background of his characters, it is done so predictable and clumsy that I found myself grumbling at the absent director ""O.K., you tried, you failed, get back to action!"" The only good thing about ""TR"" is likely Angelina. She's the only ""visual effect"" that grabbed my attention. But even her presence can't help this flick from being a total waste of time.So, in the end, I can just hope that ""TR"" remains the ultimate bottom of video game adaptations and that future attempts will treat the original material with more respect. There's actually some good stuff out there (imagine a good script for Nintendo's epic ""Legend of Zelda"" in the hands of a skilled director!), so don't mess it up like West did!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

In a film like this, that's the difference between crap and great fun. Also, there isn't a real bad guy. Unlike the Indiana Jones series, you really can't tell if the enemy really is an enemy.

Yes, just when I thought I had embarked upon a successful movie-going plan to avoid seeing any movie worse than Driven the rest of the year I was defeated by Laura Crap: Patience Grater.  I almost fell asleep during this drivel - during the ""climatic"" ""action"" scene.  I've never fallen asleep during any movie.I really went in with low expectations (especially in light of the reviews) figuring that Angelina Jolie is hot enough to carry a mindless summer action flick.  She isn't.  This movie is so bad that I am overwhelmed as to what specific points warrant ridicule.  I actually turned to my wife during the serious Illuminati scene and asked how any actor could possible keep a straight face spouting such drivel.  The power of a paycheck, I suppose.If you want an interesting, compelling, intelligent story involving ancient artifacts and the Illuminati, I would suggest picking up a copy of Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. The ending leaves much to be desired but it is a great story.  Back to trashing Tomb Raider.  The action is inane. Laura apparently has never been taught that accelerators/throttles are a variable input device - every vehicle, regardless of locale is driven at maximum throttle.  Laura, it isn't simply an on/off switch!  Speaking of vehicles, according to Autoweek, Land Rover spent $175,000 (two were made) on the modified Defender 90  used in the film.  Why?  It was in there for all of 2 minutes driven at, you guessed it, wide open throttle, off it's parachute platform into swamp.  None of it's features were employed, and we can't even buy the Defender 90 here in the US!I read several interviews (courtesy of GameSpy Daily) about the making of the movie.  About how they were the first American filmmakers in Cambodia in decades and the weeks they spent there?  Why?  The Angkor Wat scenes took place principally on sound stages.  The crew allegedly risked life and limb for the Iceland shooting?  Why?  It also was mostly sound stages.This movie is so typical of the utter trash that Hollywood is determined to foist off on the movie-going public and witnessing the opening weekend numbers, trash that they are more than willing to swallow.  The dialogue was terrible, the plot shallow, unoriginal and contrived, the acting mediocre at it's best and laughable most of the time.  The action was designed to meet that hideous Hollywood standard best described as violent liberalism - guns are seen but seldom if ever used as effective tools against the most evil of enemy, acrobatics are masqueraded as combat, and the heroine makes the lamest of choices in an effort to meet some idiotic morality.Don't see this.  Really.  Don't.  I wouldn't even recommend renting it. When you get a gratuitous (and of course teasing) shower scene in the first five minutes of the movie, you know it is going to be crap.  Wake up America!  Action can be combined with intelligence, character development, sound plotting, and realistic dialogue.  Don't settle for this drivel!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

447,johnnysure,"Angie won't take the Oscar, but the MTV Movie Award is hers",8,16 June 2001,"Ah, now that is what an absolutely ridiculous video-game-based action movie is supposed to be like!  It ain't ""Raiders"", but it sure is a darn sight better than ""The Mummy Returns"".  Why?  Well, for starters, there is the plot.  It is so ludicrously convoluted in premise, I bet it would take me the whole thousand words to explain that universal-alignment/key-to-time thing that they are chasing after.  Nothing on the level of the race for the Ark of the Covenant, but far more entertaining than a big hunt for the CGI-version of the Rock.  In structure, however, the plotting is very simple:  actionscene-otherstuff-actionscene-otherstuff, etc.  That's not a complaint; that's as it should be. Some will say this movie is cheesy.  Yeah, it is.  Is that a problem? Then why are you going to see this?  Merchant/Ivory has something opening this weekend, too.  Go see that. Next, the acting.  Well, Jon Voight is one of my favorite actors who went MIA in the mid-'80's.  10 years later, he came back, and although he isn't making anything on the level of ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Deliverance"", or ""Runaway Train"", his acting hasn't dropped a notch.  He may have only fifteen minutes onscreen in this movie, but they are fifteen good ones. Any great actor can do Shakespeare; it takes someone special to play a video game character explaining the complexities of the Key to Time and actually make it effective. However, none of this amounts to a hill of beans, because, really, this movie is all about one thing, and her name's Angelina.  And, oh man, does she rule.  You think playing a kick-butt female action hero is easy? Before a few years ago, only Sigourney and Linda had pulled it off.  This movie may not be in that league, but Angie sure is.  She pouts, she flips, she gets as naked as possible in a PG-13 movie, beats up a 40-foot 6-armed statue, and she even has one of those all-out mano-a-mano fights to the death with the villain that movies have been lacking lately.

""Duuuh,maybe she've read it in one of here books""? Of course she has. BUT WHY CAN'T ANYONE EXPLAIN THAT???

She portrayed Lara very well (and her father couldn't have been cast better [snicker]) but the rest of it was slightly less than annoying. The people in this movie couldn't act if their life depended on it.It seems to me that this movie was designed only to promote Angelina. It was all focused on her and not much focused on the plot...little that it was. (Who was the little girl? Why was she there?)

The first thing you'll like about this when you play it is the main menu (even though it is a little loud). The way it opens up is the broken pieces of the clock that get frozen in time in the movie magnetize together to form the clock in one piece. The clock opens up and you get the main menu choices. After choosing the extras, the camera flips around and down through the clock and it gets to the planetary set at the end of the movie only it's bright blue and white. If you choose any of the options in this the camera will chase the planet that the option is on and it will play the choice.But here you should choose the Alternate Opening sequence option. The way this plays out is you'll hear the music then see a thin yellow line form on the screen. As the camera zooms out the yellow line becomes a downward arch-shape (like the top of a circle) and it becomes obvious that the yellow line is the top of the Sun coming out of an eclipse. As the eclipse slowly ends, a flash of light forms at the very top. The camera zooms back in and something forms in the middle of this bright flash. It the entrance to an ancient Aztec building (like what you would expect from the ancient race in the movie). It glides through the entrance and through a maze of sorts. In this maze you'll notice the place where the Lara kept the chip that played music in Simon the robot after she defeated it. As it glides up a ramp at starts to ""fly"" again above the walls and zooms out one more time to reveal the sign ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"". Once it gets a good view of the sign, it disappears into the middle of Lara's eye, as at the start of the movie, and finishes there. I suppose it would have been even better if there was option that you could start the actual movie with this alternate opening and add the deleted scene of Wilson getting murdered by Powell and, if there was another scene that could have fitted into the movie (in general- you'll know if you see it) then that scene could have had an option to be added into the movie where it belonged as well.Now onto the movie itself.It couldn't have been done better with Angelina Jolie. I will agree that the second movie, but who gives a s**t?! I still own the double set. In the first movie, Angie has given the performance everything. She has shown an incredible insight into her character and personally blown me away.

You are doing, you are killing the enemies by the hundreds, you are running away the falling stones, that NEVER fall in front of you, only behind, and getting closer.

Ripley and Linda Hamilton, as an instance, but they are smart, tough, but not invulnerable. All the characters were undefined, and too plain. Including Lara Croft.

In 'Tomb Raider' Angelina Jolie uses ""the power of God"" to..... see her father. The Indiana Jones connection comes from the settings and the intricate booby traps.  There were a couple of anomalies, such as the ancient models of the solar system with 9 planets (Pluto having been discovered Feb 18, 1930).  If you are a die hard Jolie fan, have at it. If your looking for a good action film, watch something else.  This movie can wait for HBO.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
470,darlinge,Worst movie of 2001,2,19 June 2001,"This has to be one of the worst movies of 2001. I say this because I expected so much from this movie. It was a character that everyone could relate to, it had an oscar winning actress, it had great supporting actors. What it didn't have was great dialogue, a great storyline, suspense and great direction or flow.I found myself nodding off during supposed action sequences that have been overdone in other movies but in a grander and on a more exciting scale. I didn't like the way Mr. West developed the character of Lara Croft and I thought Ms. Jolie was horribly wasted as an actor. I even found that I could care less which side won. The villian wasn't very evil, well they tried to make him at the end with the watch from her father. Too little too late.
If you agree or disagree with me, you got to admit to yourself, this movie did not reach even a third of its potential. I was looking for a strong female version of Indiana Jones and got a strong female version of Allan Quatermain. Granted that is ok, but do I really want to settle for ok with this franchise and this actor.Well there will be a sequel and I just hope and pray that this was just a stepping stone to greater things.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
471,sailgrl18,you need the right outlook,7,22 June 2001,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I think that Angelina Jolie does a good job and her stunts are incredibly fun to watch.  The thing is I went into it thinking that it wasn't going to be a serious movie, just a fun action movie.  It definitely lived up to that description.Some things that I noticed while watching:  The entire movie is about making Angelina look cool.  She is wearing a skin tight tank top while everybody else is in down jackets.  The other thing is look at her, you will notice that she looks bruised in some sequences.  I think that those ""bruises"" might be her loads of tattooes under the body makeup.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
472,sermon,Just like the games - average ... VERY average ...,1,28 June 2001,"First of all  I never liked the Tomb Raider games-series.I see them as very average games that are highly overrated. It kind of fills me with pain when people mention the Tomb Raider games being up there with the real classics of computergames history, because I think that it is an offense to the real classic computergames out there. So why did these games become so successfull?Because there was a gigantic marketing campaign behind the games (the hype got actually that far that there was a Tomb Raider Shower gel available!!) and the heroine was a big-breasted babe.What we have learned from the past is, that computergames never spawn good movies ... and the outcome to me was very clear when I heard that a so-so computergame like Tomb Raider would end up on the big screen.Tomb Raider is one of those movies where, when the lights go back on, you have the impression that you have been sitting in a car for two hours and have been staring at a red traffic light. Blankness. Total blankness. The whole movie is about ""let's go on to the next big explosion and hope that the people get distracted from the huge plot-holes"". Thirty minutes into the film you'll find yourself wondering what you're watching, and forty minutes in you'll find yourself wondering why you are watching this. What you'll find throughout the whole movie is boredom, overworked CG and huge plotholes. Not that I did expect anything more, because .. hey ... I know the quality of the Tomb Raider computergames ... and even really good computergames ended up in a bad movie.Mind you, the movie is ok when you're absolutely braindead and you just want to watch some dumb action flick with tons of special effects and explosions (more something you'd rent on DVD and forget about it after you've seen it), but if you're into characters, storyline and good acting, go see something else.To sum it all up  Tomb Raider tries to be a James Bond/Indiana Jones rip-off never reaching the quality of the two franchises, but it will be a huge success after all ... why?Firstly - there are a lot of male teens out there with a Playstation and dreams about Lara Croft and secondly - Marketing, ladies and gentlemen, Marketing . . .",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
473,tony.newton,"Not as good as it could have easily been, but worth a view.",7,9 July 2001,"Angelina Jolie, other than the too ""English"" English accent (how can Americans, in this day and age, still stereo-type the English so much like they did back when they made Mary Poppins?), was made to play Lara, and does a good job of it. The action sequences are great, and the plot just about solid enough to get by. However, the film is broken up into sections of great action, interspersed with not interesting enough plot and dialogue.The opening sequence, the soldiers raid to steal the amulet/clock and the Cambodia action is all excellent, and if only these were stiched together better by a more coherent plot and better characters it could have been a classic. Jolie's portrayal of Lara is very good, and she has captured the style of the character well. I'd like to have seen more weaponry and more tomb raiding.At the end of the day you just don't care enough about the characters - not like you do in say, Raiders of the Lost Ark - so the plot just loses, well, the plot!Lara is great, her dad is a non-entity, the gizmo guy is a bore, the villains are okay, but not fleshed out enough.  All in all a great opportunity missed, but an entertaining little film nonetheless. Now I hope they make a second and actually employ a scriptwriter next time.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

It's quite like the game, has many good action scenes, and Angelina Jolie was great as Lara Croft.The action scenes (most of them) were really good. Great special effects, not so many stupid lies, and of course Angelina showing pretty much everything she could during fighting scenes. I'm not sure if the movie was too much of an adventure movie, especially because they focused more on Lara than in the adventure itself, but the story was all right.Anyway, my suggestion is: if you like the game and usually enjoy action movies you'll probably have a lot of fun. And if you like Angelina and want to see the movie more because of the special effects than the plot (like myself) you'll like it even more.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
477,jlovf,Action/adventure delivers what it promises - and then some,8,7 July 2001,"Lara Croft, of computer animated Tomb Raider fame, is brought to life in this fast paced adventure which owes quite a lot to the Indiana Jones-films. No surprise there, as the computer game itself was a homage to the Steven Spielberg trilogy. Angelina Jolie is perfect in the role as the beautiful Lara, and the rest of the cast is well put together - notice Chris Barrie as the butler and Noah Taylor as Lara's comedic sidekick. The major let-down of this movie is the action-sequences. Director West attempts to put the viewer into the action, but the result is at times confusing and tiresome - especially the scene in Lara's mansion is a disgrace. Other than that, Tomb Raider gives us heaps of action, fun, and a somewhat intriguing storyline, along with Jolie's always charismatic and sensual performance. And that is all I expected from this movie.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

483,stuartbanham,This movie is rubbish,4,5 August 2002,"When I heard they were going to make a movie of Tomb Raider - I thought great. I love those games and they will translate perfectly into a movie.How can they possibly go wrong I thought - all you have to do is watch the game as a movie and simply make what you see into an actual movie. It's all there atmosphere, music, characters and plot.Sadly the makers of this movie were not interested in what made the game great but rather churning out another piece of hollywood action rubbish to make a quick buck. The only elements they in fact keep from the game are Lara's chest size (which was never important to me personally) and the guns - that's about it.In true churn-out-a-movie-that-the-fans-will-see-no-matter-what-the-quality-so-we-do n't-have-to-bother style there is the pointless addition of 'comedy' side kicks thereby ignoring the first rule of Tomb Raider - Lara is a LONER. 'Comedy' is of course in inverted commas because if you find these guys funny from this script then you can most definitely check yourself into a clinic for a humour (or even a brain) transplant.I would blame the director or the script (not Angelina, she at least was good casting) but fundamentally the problem is that this movie was made because they knew we'd turn out for it no matter what and so they didn't bother.Tomb Raider needs an Arthouse or Independent type director who loves the games and wants to make those great elements into a movie. It does not need the Hollywood treatment it got here.I have nothing more to say except DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE unless you genuinely want to see a rubbish movie because you have nothing better to do. In which case I would say - FIND SOMETHING TO DO - DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

And I wasn't pleasantly surprised.Start off with a beginning sequence that is so out of kilter with the rest of the movie it's stupid (gizmo guy gets big introduction, then adds absolutely nothing), and go downhill from there (Lara dodges bullets better than Keanu in Matrix, goes off in search of thing, bad guy is also after thing, find thing, have a bit of pre-pub banter and duke it out for a finish).If you are tempted by Angelina, watch the first five minutes and leave.

487,lds BellaOnline,Two Guns Up!!!,8,18 June 2001,"After reading other reviews about Tomb Raider I have decided that I must have seen a different film than most of these critics.  Maybe I just fell into some parallel universe.  They complain about the plot, about the film being a mere rip off of Indiana Jones but little do they remember that Indiana Jones was but a rip off of the serials of the 40's and 50's. I get the feeling that most of them have never even seen these.Tomb Raider is much fun as an action adventure flick can be.  Dodging bullets and saving the world are the schedule of the day.  Sure it sounds like a video game plot but that's because it is a video game.  Cool stunts, over the top action, game style music, nice camera work, and angles add to the overall slick feel of the film.  Its Indiana Jones and Duran Duran videos all wrapped up in a 1 hour 40 minute package.Many do not like Angelina Jolie as an actress but I think that she embodies the character of Lara Croft.  Her mysterious, and even wild nature, is put to good use as a female action lead.  Young girls, such as myself, who enjoyed action films, were rarely allowed to witness women characters beyond the whine ones created by filmmakers and writers.  Well, here is a character that embodies many young women's fancies of adventure and thrillsFor any action adventure fan this is a must see theater film.  Much of the wonderful visuals and effects will be lost on the small screen as well as the rocking soundtrack.  Those of you who are ambivalent about this style may just want to wait for the video release.Move over Indian Jones, Lara Croft is here!!!  I give this film two guns up!!!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
488,ClericJack,Indiana Jones wanna-be!,1,16 June 2001,"Well, what can I say?  Angelia Jolie is one fine babe and is a very good actress.  That's about all I can say that is good about Tomb Raider.  Most of the time viewing this film I was telling myself I would get more enjoyment out of renting Raiders of the Lost Ark.  In that film the action sequences were more original, the plot was infinitely better, and the acting itself was ten times more impressive than they were in Tomb Raider.  I was very disappointed in this film.  I wanted an original film not a Indiana Jones wanna-be!  Scratch that, not only did Tomb Raider want to be a Indiana Jones wanna-be, it wanted to be a Mummy wanna-be! (Which in of itself, The Mummy is an Indiana Jones wanna-be!)",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
489,samlapeste,It's a video game adaptation for goodness sake!,8,22 June 2001,"Angelina Jolie plays Lady Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, an action film based on a popular video game.  That being said, Simon West's challenge was to give Lara Croft a real life character while keeping the action sequence in line with the video game.The film warms up with an action clip showing Lady Croft combating a robot in a tomb setting.  After she turns the heavy metal into scrap, the scene quickly changes to Lady Croft resting in her castle in England lamenting the loss of her father, archaeologist genius, Lord Croft (Jon Voight).  (Isn't it interesting that Angelina Jolie is playing opposite her real life dad, Jon Voight?)The loss of her father fuels her adventure which begins when the planetary alignment takes place, an event that occurs only once every 5,000 years. The planetary alignment sets the scene for the discovery of a mysterious object, which legend has it serves as the key to controlling time.  Not surprisingly, there is a secret society at work to obtain this power.  As with any action flick, it is the hero's mission, or heroine in this case, to save the world.If you have played the video game, you will agree that Angelina Jolie is truly the perfect pick for the Lara Croft role.  She's sassy, clever, fearless, invincible, and she exudes sexuality in everything that she does. With every victory, she radiates a sensual glow as if she has conquered. Who needs a man when you're a tomb raider!Just as all video games switch to different levels, the film also changes scenes quite often.  One moment you're in England and the next you're in Cambodia.  Don't be surprised that Lara can speak the native language in every country she visits.  She has the amazing ability to dodge bullets as well!  And one more thing, don't be alarmed that Lara is clad so scantily throughout the film.  Lara Croft is a fantasy adaptation.  If you can maintain this perspective then you just might be entertained!",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

491,Alex_209,An insult to the games,1,1 August 2002,"I'm a fan of the first three Tomb Raider games. After the Last Revelation, they just get boring. Ever since I played Tomb Raider 1, back in '97, I thought how great it would be to see a Tomb Raider movie. But I had no idea they'd make such an awful job of it.One aspect of the Tomb Raider games that I believe was a very important asset was the music. The title sequences and the atmospheric music were all top quality. Naturally, I was horrified when I heard the efforts of the film's soundtrack. I'm not saying Elevation was bad. Rather, that 'Lara's Party Mix' (or whatever it was called) was the most sacrilegious piece of crap you could imagine. After such great musical scores from the game, it really degrades Lara.The first sign I got that this film would be rubbish was when I learned that Lara's father was called Richard Croft. Anyone who's read the Tomb Raider 1 manual will know that her father is Lord Henshingly Croft. Although the name itself doesn't really make a difference, it told me that the writers had abandoned the original works. It came as no surprise that the plot was a load of rubbish. It would have been much better to stick completely to the plot of Tomb Raider 2 (the game). Mortal Kombat was made into a film. And it was good, because Boon and Tobias, who made the games, wrote the script.The way Lara Croft was portrayed gives fans of the game a bad name. In the games, Lara doesn't shoot a load of people. And she certainly doesn't have some geek as a sidekick. She goes it alone, which gives the games the atmosphere that was non-existent in this film. There could have, at least, been a puzzle thrown in there. The Indiana Jones films were much better than this. In fact, if Indy wore a tutu and called himself Lara, it would still be a better game-to-movie conversion.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I would like to argue against those that consider Lara a female Indiana Jones, as this movie lack in quality, action, humor and acting when compared to the Indy-movies. Sure, the special effects are top-notch, but that doesn't make the movie any better in the long run. The movie is pretty straight forward, no unexpected turns really, with a tendency to get a bit sentimental in the second half. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised in one way as the movie does contain a bit more actual storyline than I suspected it would, but I also am a bit dissappointed as I was expecting a great deal more action.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

You'll be disappointed(I was),5,17 June 2001,"I was so psyched about going to see this movie...I thought, Angelina Jolie in an action flick, and as Lara Croft at that?  It has to be awesome.  But I was disappointed.  The storyline is pretty weak, not what I'd expect because the video games were so cool.  Gamers will see alot of obstacles in the movie that they faced in the games, but that doesn't affect the movie quality.  The action scenes are awesome, and Angelina Jolie is ten times sexier with a British accent, but I walked out of the theater scratching my head at a few things, like little subplots that they started on and forgot to tie up.  I will not write a spoiler, but I will say that the good guy-bad guy tension is a joke, because there really isn't any, and the ""bad guy"" isn't very bad, no Darth Vader-like sinister tendencies or anything close. Like I said in the one liner I was expecting something along the lines of Raiders of the Lost Ark or one of the Indy movies, just with Angelina instead of Harrison Ford.  This could've been an awesome movie if they'd hired a competent script writer, but I guess they spent so much on special effects they had to cut the budget somewhere.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Oh wait, one should have reasons why they should try to tell others to avoid things like this. Well, this movie was not well thought out, especially that so-called important script thingy. It WAS however a very nice attempt to cash in on what was once a respected franchise of a video game with a mega babe starring in it. (Is it kosher to call a computer-generated girl a mega babe? - well, you decide...)So without trying to sound completely that negative about this trashy pic, I must say the set design was outstanding and Angelina Jolie does look great!! (And seems to pull off a believable Lara Croft) That of course does not make up for the horrible acting support, weak storyline and unintelligible pace.

There was a rumour floating around amongst my friends that Angelia good one hundred thousand to get breast augmentation to fill (no pun intended) the physical characteristics of Lara, who's supposed to be 34 DD. I haven't been able to substantiate this comment. But in one scene you can see added padding.Also, the butler is supposed to be old, Lara uses Desert Eagles, but in the movie she's using HKs. And I think for one person to be able to single handedly beat a SWAT-like team really reaches. But that's not what turned me off. The plot is thin and doesn't hold together as one would hope. Dialogue isn't the greatest either. I'm not a movie student so if you want in depth analysis, thats not me. In laymans terms, anyone can pump cash into a movie and make it look spiffy.

I was totally emersed in the action and the character, Lara Croft, also I thought that the plot fit the Tomb Raider environment quite effectively.

And it's like they say: Opinions are like butts, everyone's got one and they all stink :pNow on to my rantI thought this movie was terrible. In fact, I rated it a 1 on the poll. Why, you ask? Quite a few reasons.Firstly, I felt the plot was somewhat drab and cloudy. Not a lot of explanation was given of some details, and what WAS given was at inappropriate times, or sometimes not at all. Like, who was Alex?  called him the Tomb Raider as well, but from where? Maybe I missed something? They really didn't give much background on him or his connection to Lara, other than that he was a fellow archaeologist. Also, very little info was given on the Illuminati and the old dude that headed it up.Next point, the plot. It was OLD. End of story. I mean, the old ""boo hoo, loved one died, must get him back even if it means sacrificing what is right"" plot has been played many more times than once, and pretty much put me and many others around me to sleep. I actually saw one guy dozing 4 or 5 seats away from me, no joke. People were leaving the theater halfway thru the movie. They were demanding their money back from the box officer because they complained the plot was ""old, cloudy, and boring"". All our local newspapers claimed that the movie's ""merely half decent action and special effects"" were put under by the movie's ""weak, brittle plot"". I couldn't agree more.3rd Point: The action. What action? They advertised action that would be better than the Matrix. I went into that movie expecting action that would make my insides leap and my grin grow broader and broader. And for the first 10 mins, it did. Then Lara yelled STOP. It was like she told the movie to STOP going in the great direction it was and start getting crappier. What the HELL happened? The action in this movie just made me anticipate when it would be over. It could also be considered ""repetetive"" and ""boring,"" as well as ""stupid"" and ""dumb.""A fourth and smaller point: The soundtrack. I mean what the hell, I honestly wonder if they hired a 3 year old to bang on pots and wham a keyboard hoping to make some sort of music. This poor-man's composition of music is like ramming screwdrivers into your ears.Finally, I'd like to just say I'm not in any way disappointed in Angelina Jolie. She tried her best to fit the part of a character for a movie that was just not destined to be good. Video-game to movie crossovers just don't work. Take Super Mario Brothers for example. Nuff said.In conclusion, what I'd hoped to be the summer hit turned out to be the fish someone caught and forgot to throw back, getting stinkier and stinkier as it lies in the sun. The SFX were decent, that's about it.Sorry all you Tomb Raider fans, save your money : Buy the games and go see Evolution.Thanks for your time all, see you in the movies",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
505,RWELCH,Boy did I waste my money on this one.....,2,20 July 2001,"I didn't enjoy this movie at all.  The whole time that I sat watching the movie I thought that it would get better until the end came and it never got any better.  It was hard to understand what was going on half the time. Don't get me wrong Angelina Jolie is a fine actor and I love her work, but it just felt like she was trying too hard and the movie came off as being quite corny.  I really wanted to get my money back.  I knew that I wasn't the only one who felt this way because as I was walking out of the theater, I could hear complete strangers saying the same thing I did, ""I wasted $10 for this?""  You can count on that not happening again for the sequel.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
506,mors3953,Not Worth the money!,2,20 June 2001,"Tomb Raider, there is only three reasons worth going to this movie, the butler, the cambodia location and the Shots of Angelina Jolie in pg-13 material.  I mean really.  There is no energy in the villain and no conviction in the dark organization out to control the world.  Angelina Jolie can act, I've seen her at it.  But in this movie she just doesn't sell her character.  Jolie relies on her body and moves to support Lara Croft. The Butler on the other hand, is a valuable addition in bringing Lara Croft to life.  His straight man wit attempts to pull Jolie back to a character we can root for.

I'd like to say something to the writers of this movie. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!!! Nothing obviously! We'll just have CGI on the screen so they have something to watch while they eat their popcorn. I would have been as involved sitting in front of a camp fire. That's pretty too. Raiders of the lost Ark was everything this movie wasn't. Indie was human. The audience identified with him, so we were involved in his struggle. The Ark Of The Covenant is also an actual artifact, so at least it was some what educational.

However, it's nothing like the game at all. No mazes, only a very limited amount of opponents and only quite a few different locations. Angelina Jolie does her very best to be as sportive and sexy as the digital Lara we all know... However, what really strikes me as odd is the scene in the shower. First of all, it should have been let out of the movie entirely, and secondly, they shouldn't have given a short backside glimpse at her, ehm..., breast. That's really not like Lara Croft.

While great for some action sequences, this story made no sense, and it was hard to tell if Laura was really out to reunite herself with her father, or if she was out for a good time.  And what is with the kid? For no explained reason, there's a kid in the story, that appears from nowhere from time to time and tells Laura that she's senselessly risking everything to see her father again.  And whenever the kid disappears, there's always flowers where she was standing.  What the hell?

Zero for Croft's butler being Rimmer/Mr Brittas and all 5 points for Angelina Jolies amazingly cool, almost feral performance.If you rent the DVD I suggest you watch the ""making of"" bits, then watch the film again, you'll be far more impressed when you realise how much Jolie did herself.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Angelina Jolie is fantastic as Lara and plays the character just about as close as is physically possible. The opening scene(s) are my favourite, and really sum up Lara's personality, although there are a couple of gratuitous shower scenes that aren't really essential to the plot!!. Although Lara's history differs from the games' it's not far out and is easily forgiven by all the sfx and action sequences. The 'bungy ballet' scene is breathtaking and I've totally worn out the soundtrack CD! Chris Barrie and Noah Taylor add some really funny moments, not sure about Alex West as a love interest though. Overall, a great film, even for non-followers of the game (where have you been?) and an absolute must-see for fans of Lara Croft. Can't wait until Cradle of Life is released...",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
519,Sn0wman,2 Guns Up,10,19 March 2003,"Angelina Jolies performance is simply flawless.  She gives Lara Croft the charming elegance and feminine grit that makes her classy yet badass.  The action scenes in the film were very well done.  Even the more far fetched fantasy elements were made to be believable.  For 100 minutes the film  runs full throttle.

These movies don`t work like that. They should be exciting and nicely set and adventurous and very fast. Tomb Raider has all this and I love watching it because of its speed.And of course because of Angelina Jolie who looks great but also enacts as Lara as no one else could have.

I rented and watched it at home... and 20 minutes into the movie I had to turn it off.  This movie doesn't seem to rely on plot, but there are good action movies without plots.  This movie attempts to rely on action but the action is stale and lifeless.  There is still the fact that it stars Angelina Jolie, one of the hottest women in Hollywood.  However, the amount of Angelina's body we see does not justify an entire movie.  If you want to see more of her, go look for Gia.

When they find it we see they have no reason to look for that stuff. It's all out of boredom.They have nothing better to do with their time.So there. That's a complete and full summary of the story. The movie had only one scene which has humor in it.Other than that it had no emotions ,jokes whatsoever. In fact there were no dialogs at all.Action scenes were pretty mediocre.We have stone warriors that can be beaten by bare fists for God's sake.All in all it was totally terrible except the bouncing parts of the movie.

Angelina Jolie doesn't do anything outstanding in this movie, the cast isn't huge,although Angelina should be applauded for her stunt work. Most movies that are based on games are unsuccessful ( Street Fighter,Mortal Kombat) though this may be the best of the 3.If you were or are a fan of the game Tomb Raider, you might be excited with this movie, i wasn't a fan of the game, so i just watched the movie for the heck of it, i wasn't expecting much, and i didn't receive much. The plot is confusing and pretty much stupid, though you should take note on the beautiful locations.I must say i was fairly disappointed, it wasn't really a good film, sure Angelina looks great, but im sure she was cast to increase her fame, a very average movie, and should be chucked in to the ""Games to Movies"" section, and yes its not a success.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The plot is quite the kind of you could expect in a hunting treasure archaeological adventure like this. The action sequence were good, and the acting were above the average. Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig did an amazing job. One can forgive some flaws as long as you take into account the source material. Something spectacular to me, that seems to had been passed unnoticed is the cinematography. The lighting of the sets and the visuals look of the film both stands alone for themselves.

Do not watch under any means. This is a bad,bad,bad film",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
527,Ripley_08,An interesting experience in sex appeal ...,5,18 April 2007,"My (viewing!) experience with Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider) was, frankly, a bit unsettling! Here we have an actress who, supposedly, exudes sexual energy and charisma and to be honest she does reek of it in this film. The problem is she has absolutely no-one to direct it towards.I assume Daniel Craig was the intended target of SOME of this sexual energy, but either her aim is as crap as a Russian foot soldier in a James Bond film or he's as thick as lumpy custard. Whatever! It didn't work.All of which begged the question  who is she seducing?? Am I the one to whom she's directing all of those meaningful looks and double-entendres? Thanks Sweetie but my heart's spoken for.But then it occurred to me that most of the sexy banter and suggestions took place when she was alone. Is she actually talking to herself? Which would mean she wants to have sex with  Either possibility would send a teenage guy to kicks heaven I suppose (let's face it, this film was not made for the girlies) but it left me squirming on the sofa (and not in the good way).",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
528,schizophrenicgeek,Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,29 December 2005,"The characters are complete clichés (standard villain, tech expert for comic relief), the dialogue is atrocious and the ending is as predictable as they come. Jolie is a nightmare in the role. She looks the part, but that's about it. She seems to think that a smug grin passes as acting. The action scenes are beyond ridiculous. They're not clever, they're not thrilling, they're not original, they're just stupid. They seem to be trying for a cross between the Matrix and Indiana Jones, but the problem is that both The Matrix and the Indiana Jones movies are believable within their own world, Tomb Raider's not. It's not engaging because it's unoriginal and there's no emotional centre to Lara beyond a hackneyed pain at the loss of her father. Everything else is about trying to make her look cool (generic hard rock/electronic music whenever she's on her bike or walking in slow motion, wearing sunglasses indoors, etc). I thought that there was great potential in this, but the final product is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Unfortunately, the whole thing was a real let down.  Where was the excitement?  Only the first action scene had any real energy to it.  The ""bungee"", Angkor Watt & Iceland scenes all had great set design, but felt bland and sluggish.  I think part of the bring down is that there's a lot more invested in playing the game: At any given point you have a good chance at failure.  In the movie, after the first thousand or so bullets miss Lara, any sort of anticipation is deflated and your left looking at your watch and dwelling on the weak story being played out.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
530,SprJkr,Worst summer movie since Speed 2,1,25 June 2001,"Ever since seeing the greatly hyped sequel to Speed, Speed 2 - Cruise Control I thought Hollywood would ever create a summer that terrible again. I was wrong. Yes, despite that summer movies are made for their popcorn, eye-catching appeal and do you rarely see an academy award nomination other than best sound or visual effects, Tomb Raider has to be the worst summer movie since Speed 2. Where one feature of the movie was lacking (such as the storyline), I looked to another feature of the movie (the action scenes) just to be as disappointed.To begin with lets begin with the terrible storyline and characters. The storyline lacks in any intensity or danger. Not once did I ever feel that Laura Croft was ever in any danger or even got really that beat up. Other than that scratch on her arm that the Monk's tea healed and a bloody lip. Also the characters where terrible accept for Jolie's. And even then the fake English accent and the bad azz attitude about where ever she just decided to parade through was ridiculous. Indi at least had to sneak around for fear of being caught or killed. Then there is her little buddy who designed all her gizmo's and lived in a trailer thats right out of Charlie's Angels. Oh and that is gizmo, the only cool thing about her ""gear"" was the backpack that she reloads her guns with. I was hoping for at least a wide range of gizmos and gadgets or something. Who know hand held lanterns with no off switch (remember she had to hide it behind a rock) were so new aged technology. Furthermore who was Powell and who was West? You never know if there was any romantic past or not between West and Croft. All you know is that West is the ever redundant, ""In it for the money"" character. Also why is Powell so bad, other than being a ""lawyer"" (Baa Baa Ching....groan, lame overdone joke). But seriously if Powell was to obtain the triangle what was he going to do with it? He never said, other than let Laura see her father. Heck Powell was kind of a nice guy in that aspect. Other than that it just seemed that Powell wanted a little triangle to add to his collection, nothing more. So I never really felt like the rest of the world was ever in any danger. I could have been eating my Frosted Flakes and never of known the difference.Now for the worst part of the movie the action sequences! COMPLETELY UNORIGINAL!!!!!!! To begin with the action scene in the beginning is straight out of the opening action scenes of Indiana Jones. Next we move to the bungee scene. Here we have a rip off of the pulley scene in the computer room from the first Mission: Impossible. Then we go to the car garage of Crofts's abode. And here we find more James Bond 007 cars than I've ever seen. Not to mention the McGuyver like ""drill gun"". Then the motorcycle up on one wheel n' all again Mission Impossible but this time the Part 2. Where to next ahh yes the actually original fight scenes that were lame. I never knew fighting a 5000-year-old armed statue could be so easy. Just one good whack to the gut and down they go. What else..... ah yes, the Back to the Future references. I believe I remember Doc Brown telling Marty McFly ""Destroy the time machine it brings nothing but trouble, and can bring nothing but evil if to fall into the wrong hands."" Now Biff did some damage if I remember correctly. Anyway here we are with Lord Croft telling Laura ""Destroy the Triangle it brings nothing but trouble, and can bring nothing but evil if in the wrong hands."" You know the whole time I'm thinking why didn't she destroy the one part of the triangle in the first place. The Aluminate would just be running around looking for the other piece of a triangle. Not knowing that Laura had already destroyed the other half. Bada bing, movie over. BUT NO, being led out of the ice cavern by the team of dogs. Hmmmm again I think of Indi being dragged behind the Nazi truck by his whip.I'm sorry if you have found my rantings offensive if you really liked the movie that much. I am aware that this is a summer movie, but as far as summer movies go this ranks down there with Speed 2. This movie is just plain terrible! I didn't find anything really that interesting or exciting about it. It's a movie that I left feeling like I've seen hundreds of times before. At least this wasn't as bad as Speed 2, but it's the worst one I've seen since it. I'm dreading the sequel, I don't know why Paramount is going to want to make another installment, but hey sometimes you get lucky. That is if you have better writers, director, and actors. Video game movies should stay where they belong in my opinion, on our televisions and PC's. I was hoping that perhaps this time they could make something out of it, I've been let down again. Although that Final Fantasy might be good..... lets hope for Video game movie's sake.Tomb Raider - (1.5/10)",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

And it wasn't. But don't get me wrong, as a film, it was bad.  Really bad.  But, somehow, I just didn't hate it.  The dialog was awful, the directing was worse, and please, everyone, lets just all for once officially send the message to movie makers that the number one thing you CAN'T skimp on is the script. When the script sucks, the whole movie is doomed to suck, no matter how many cool fight scenes you can tack on.  Jolie is, of course, a magnificent Lara. But this movie proves that even an Oscar winner can't breath much life into horrendous dialog.  But I repeat, I didn't hate it.  I had fun seeing Lara recreated on screen.  In a way, it was like watching a really well done FMV sequence from the game.

My love of Lara and my love of Angelina are separate, of course.  Angelina was a  perfect Lara.  Even though I wanted a real Brit to play the part.  I can't believe they searched the world and couldn't find a British Lara.Tomb Raider was disappointing, depending upon whether you play the game or not.  And if Lara Croft is new to you...the game is still better than the movie! The movie set us up for something imperically nasty to happen.  But I wanted it to be deeper and nastier than it ended up being, and I wanted to see Lara more affected by her father.

The plot is on level with a B-movie.  The bits intended to be funny are not funny.  There is no character development.  Though Angelina Jolie could potentially make a good Lara Croft, in the movie Lara Croft comes across very flat.

I know that most film-reviewers mean this is a ""political incorrect"" movie, but the movie is entertaining, and if that's not what a GREAT part of the audience want, then what DO they want? I must admit though, that the dialogues and the `emotional acting' doesn't reach the peaks in this movie, but then again, it's an adventure movie. The visual experience is smashing; not only Lara herself, but also the settings in which the movie has been shot. This is a movie in the same lane as `X-Men', which I also enjoyed and thought was a lot of fun. So, even though I'm 25 years old, it's no problem to watch what many has called a `child's film' and `cartoon'. It's nice to step out of the cinema for once without having to speculate about what `they REALLY meant when they said that and that...'. Instead just talking about all the beauty, adrenaline and action that is what the game Tomb Raider is about  That's why I think it great that Simon West has managed to give Lara and her horde of enemies a really good transition to the not-so-interactive media",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
541,flameduck,It's bad.,1,16 July 2001,"By now we're all used to bad movies, but once in a while, a movie comes along that forces you to redefine what a bad movie is. Such a movie is Tomb Raider. Oh, it's not all bad, the acting is believable and the special effects are okay, although someone's seen entirely too much ""The Matrix"". The really bad thing about Tomb Raider is the script. It is so bad, I can't imagine how they raised funds for it in the first place. This is probably the worst movie ever to come out of a computer game, so if you thought ""Street Fighter"" was bad, you haven't seen anything yet. One thing tho' I left after having my intelligence insulted for an hour or so, but up to that point, Tomb Raider was bad, the ending might be really good, but by then you won't care, because you'll be wondering where all your popcorn have gone. They should have just called it ""Cliche Raider"", but of course then it would have been the flop it so rightfully deserved. If you want to see good special effects, see ""The Matrix"", and if you want a good adventure movie, get any of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies, you'd think that in 20 odd years, they could have come up with something better, but I repeat myself.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

And when I heard that Angelina Jolie had been cast I have to say that I had my reservations. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Angelina but I was not sure how I felt about an american playing Lara. But after just seeing the first preview my interest was definatly peaked. And now that I have seen the movie I can't wait for the next film ( hopefully in 2003 or sooner ) to continue the life of Lara. Angelina manages to capture to almost perfection all the things I have loved about Lara Croft ever since the first time I picked up one of the playstation games. She conveys all the strength, intelegence and sex appeal that game and comic fans have grown to love.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Despite Jolie's pneumatic efforts, the whole film falls dramatically to pieces after even a moment's consideration.Here's the thing: if Lara's dad wants to stop the triangle being rebuilt so that its destructive power won't be unleashed on the world, and it requires the clock to get hold of the triangle, why does he tell Lara where the clock is in the first place? Furthermore, if two parts of this artefact are necessary to make it work, Lara surely doesn't need to destroy both. Why doesn't she just destroy the first part when she gets it, as this would make the second part useless? Thirdly, when we find out finally that the triangle needs a further part, where is it? Inside the clock, of course. Surely this begs the question, why not just destroy the piece inside the clock, which Richard Croft actually had in his possession, thus rendering the triangle inoperative?The fact that Bryce watches the Clangers was the only thing that stopped this movie being a total waste of time.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I admit my expectations are normally low for summer action flicks but this one went way beyond bad.THE GOOD: In the movie, Jolie looks great but then why wouldn't she? That's it.THE BAD: The opening action sequence was the best one in the movie and it stunk up the place.  There must have been 5000 jump-cuts I was dizzy.  The robot was kind of a Matrix looking rip off and it just made no sense at all. Not that it had to but come on! Prepare for robbing tombs by fighting a high-tech robot? There is zero character development except for Lara and very little at that.  There are about 6 sub-plots none of which are fleshed out. The dialog is so cliche and stale it may have been cut and pasted from other bad action movies.  I can't say the acting was bad because there was very little acting going on in this lame script.  Even Jon Voight's lines must have made him cringe.THE REST: Its too bad really, Jolie could have been a great action hero as Lara.  The movie just falls flat (pun intended).  The breasts are just a joke and not needed at all. Wasn't Angelina Jolie beautiful already?  They should have been more concerned with the quality of the script and less with Lara's chest.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

551,thud64,Mediocre at best.,4,30 November 2001,"I was sorely disappointed. When I was through viewing this movie I was convinced that it was merely a platform for:a) touting Angelina Jolie as a sex symbol.b) bringing Angelina Jolie and her father, Jon Voight, together on a film (which hadn't occurred since 1982).Throughout the film she walked like a seductress and kept pouting those lips ( are those real? ). Her British accent came and went depending on the proximity of the camera.I did like the story behind Illuminati and the ancient talisman that they sought. This was developed well and richly interwoven throughout the story.As far as this being the ""female"" Indiana Jones, I cannot agree. In all of the Indiana Jones movies, Indie got dirty, sweaty, and hurt whenever hid did battle with his archenemies. You could feel and see his mortality in each heroic effort. In this movie, like all of the other plastic heroes, you never get the sense that the heroine might be injured or killed. It was all in a day's work.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

553,Lynn Ross,Exactly what I expected.,7,21 June 2001,"This movie was exactly what I thought it would be.  It wasn't superb, but hey, it's based off a computer game.  Angelina Jolie was remarkably well-cast.  The plot was interesting, but not fabulous.  The scenery was beautiful, and the sets were absolutely fascinating.  But the best part of that movie for me was noticing all the similarities to the computer game. I'm not the expert on the Tomb Raider games since I've only played the second one, but I must say, I absolutely grinned with delight when I saw Angelina Jolie in the first scene in her famous shorts and tank top, her long braid swaying back and forth across her back.  The little sighs and grunts that she makes when discovering something or exerting herself are priceless, and even the way she pulls out her guns reflected on the game and brought a smile to my face.The reason that Tomb Raider was pretty much the only computer game I've ever played was mostly based on the fact that I like to see women portrayed in the action hero role, considering how rare that is.  Watching Trinity in The Matrix and Michelle Yeoh or Ziyi Zhang in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is similar, though of course no where near as good.The bad things about this movie are mostly that there really are quite a few holes in the plot, and the climax was pretty disappointing.  It was one of the few movies I've seen where the first two thirds of the movie were better than the last third.  This, however, does not destroy the purpose of the movie.  I think it was mostly for people who went into the theater hoping to see Lara Croft back swinging, this time on the big screen.  I'd bet that most of the people who didn't enjoy this film were just forgetting that it was molded after a computer game, and was unrealistic and exaggerated because that's exactly what the audience would be expecting.  So for those of you who liked the game, this is definitely worth seeing, if not in the theater, at least on video.Rating: 8/10",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The story - what there is of it - is cobbled together from hackneyed old cliches you've seen a dozen times before, and makes no effort to be believable. The characterisation is non-existent - we know that one character is a free spirit because he says ""I'm a free spirit"". The effects are expensive and loud, but you can't see them because the direction is so poor. And, I'm sorry Ms Jolie, but you need more than one expression and tone of voice to play even a part this simple. Halfway through the film, her sidekick remarks that his backside is getting numb.

But it came as I expected, Angelina was great, really great, you couldn´t find anyone better for Lara than her...she got style, she got the quotes and she got moves...

However, don't expect much from the film for anything much else.  The plot seems tedious and almost a nuisance to the film, in some parts confusing and will needlessly break up what could have been just one long action sequence.

Near the end Lara possesses knowledge crucial to the continuance of the story, yet we are left to guess how she acquired such knowledge.  There is also a character who appears sporadically, yet whose origin and purpose is never fully revealed. Angelina Jolie brings no small amount of charm to Lara Croft and for once we do feel a game character is giving a life of their own, thanks to her acting.

No one in Hollywood can get away with a movie with such diverse topics as living stone warriors, the Illuminati, planetary alignment, giant robots, and time travel.  What has obviously happened is that the production studio realized people would see it based on the name and not the plot, so they hired first-time writers who were paid less.  The writers came up with an outlandish movie and the director did a mediocre job.  All the characters were underdeveloped, the dialogue was poor, the action scenes were hard to follow, and the plot was confusing and seemed to be written by a five year-old.  If you enjoyed this, see some real movies and then see ""Wallet Raider"" again.

No. No no no. Do not believe them when they say ""I've never actually even played it myself. I just saw the script and had to be involved"". This movie contains many, many heavy handed references to the games--most notably, it's method of story telling. If you remove all of the gameplay from TR, and show only the cut scenes sequentially one after the other, that is pretty much how this movie is structured. A series of action scenes only barely related to each other, with no sense of place (remarkable for a movie that prides itself in being shot on location in Alaska/Cambodia/where-ever else it was filmed), no buildup or denoument, no dramatic value whatsoever.A few scenes that typify this movie's problems for me: Lara tells someone (who cares who-i forget. Maybe it was her butler, but it doesn't matter) that she has to go to Cambodia. Shocked, the butler replies ""But how will you get there?"" to which Lara responds wryly with her trademark smirk ""I'll call in a favour from an old friend"". Quick cutscene to her parachuting into Cambodia in a Jeep, begin action sequence now. Did I miss something? Should there have been a scene there indicating why it's significant that she has to call in a favour?Perplexing scene number 2: While she's in Cambodia, for no good reason she goes to a temple, in which a priest (word choice error?) gives her unsolicited magic tea that heals the little bullet scratch on her shoulder. Never before or after are these buddhist priests relevent. They were just 'neat'. You know, like in a cutscene in a video game.Aargh. There were so many more infuriating scenes--the dogsledless escape nonsense, the jasmine flower, the mystery girl who pops up and tells Lara where to go next. The pure aimlessness of everything.

Angelina Jolie is one of my favorite actresses and again she shows that she can play any role out there. This movie has a lot of fighting sequences that were amazing although they seemed endless. The plot wasn't what I expected but I think that Angelina and the rest of the cast played it out pretty good and she showed that even girls can overpower the boys. Her English accent wasn't too appealing to me, but I didn't let that ruin an otherwise great movie.

Granted, that's a short list with cruddy company, but *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* stands out among today's action movies in general.  Lara is a unique heroine with just enough of a comic-book flair to make her interesting without going too far over the top.  The James Bond/Indiana Jones combo works very well in the spirit of the game series, and that vibe translates very well onto the screen with Ms.Jolie in the part.  This movie remains true in essence to the source material while still delivering an engaging story.  Angelina is wonderful in her portrayal of the ferocious and sensual Lara Croft.  She breathes life into Lara's polygonal origins, and nice for Angelina that she gets to work with her dad.

570,sahara1607,The film is AWFUL compared to the game!,1,10 July 2006,"OK, let's get one thing straight right away: I'm a 20 yr old girl, and have been playing Tombraider since it first came out. I LOVE the game, and (unsurprisingly), tend to go more for the game-play and storyline than the obvious. The film was such a disappointment! I had heard that it was coming out ages before it did, and because I was younger and innocent, I honestly thought that it would be based on one of the games. First of all, Lara Croft is meant to be English, so at least have someone who can successfully do an English accent! OK, Jolie wasn't all that bad accent-wise, but she isn't Lara Croft. In fact (and this is saying something), my body shape is much closer to Lara Croft's than Jolie's is!! Also, what was that bit meant to be on about when she kisses that guy underwater?! The only love-interest that Croft ever had was her fiancé who dies in a plane crash! I think they must have made a mistake, because it looked as if the storyline was written by a group of junior school children. Why not base it on one of the games?! There were several story lines all ready and waiting which just needed to be touched up a little. Apparently Core Design were meant to keep a close eye on everything, but it looks as if they failed there. I wonder if another, more successful film could be made, perhaps animated instead, and have Jonell Eliot (apologies if I spelt the name wrong), do her voice? I haven't watched the second film, but according to the official Playstation magazine, it was an embarrassment. It's a shame that Jolie had to be in this, because it has made me dislike her. All because of ONE film!!!! I am very difficult to please (as you may have noticed...ahem). As I was saying; I do think she has many admiral qualities, but I can't overcome the fact that she played my former heroine so badly! I actually feel very annoyed with myself that I don't like her, but I just can't change my mind. I know it wasn't exactly her fault that the film was so bad, but I can't help noticing that she has starred in others that are also completely inaccurate. I study History at uni, and one of my lecturers said that he went to see 'Alexander', and the most interesting thing in the entire film was Jolie's earrings. So, I am assuming that it was as inaccurate as Troy.Anyway, because of the failure of Tombraider; which is unfortunate, although I hope people will always remember Lara because of the game rather than the film (and her father isn't called Richard in the game...); I can no longer watch any film with Jolie in it, which is not good because I have only seen her in Tombraider! I am being honest here: I really do apologise that I don't like Jolie, but if you had a hero (or heroine), that you really adored (and NOT because of her image), then I think you would feel the same way. Once again, apologies, and I hope that others like Jolie because of her character, as opposed to her body shape! Sahara.p.s. Just to let you know: this was my nickname for years before Jolie called her adoptive daughter 'Zahara', and if I am using capitals, it's because I want to put these particular words in italics and can't, not because I'm shouting at anyone!!x x x",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I went in not expecting anything wonderful, just a fun action movie.  The problem was that the action sequences were not fun at all to watch.  They were the most horribly choreographed pieces of combat I have ever seen on screen. There are about 20 people running around in any given action sequence and the camera can't decide which ones you should look at, so it jumps around endlessly.  The special effects, given the ammount of money spent on this film, were ludicrous.

There needs to be more Girl-starring action movies that are good. (unlike the recently released on DVD movie ULTRAVIOLET..which was a sad, pathetic attempt ) I loved the second one as well. I thought the action was well done..and I like Jolie's accent..I thought it was rather good.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
575,pjh1003,Oh dear,3,11 July 2001,"Tomb Raider is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I should have been warned by the run-jump-shoot nature of the game, but I foolishly supposed the film would compensate for the lack of interactivity by adding a plot and some pacy action scenes. Oh how wrong I was...Plot: pathetic. In fact it seemed worse than it was because it set up several intriguing possibilities, only to shun them in favour of tired cliches. The feeble plot it does have is little more than sketched out, and often makes no sense.Script: laughable. There are a handful of half-decent lines, most of which come over better in the trailer than in the film. Lots of pointless characters too, always good in a film -sigh. There are lots of non-explanations as well, e.g. - ""why doesn't my laptop work?"" - ""we're in a dead zone"". A dead zone? Of course, how foolish of me not to have realised.Acting: for the most part, risible. Angelina Jolie (Lara) does alright I suppose, though she's battling the script to the end. Not that that matters, the camera's far more interested in her chest and thighs. Iain Glen was very disappointing, especially after seeing his superb Henry V. By far the worst performance is Jon Voight, who may as well have phoned in his lines they were so flat. Granted the lines were rubbish, but surely he could have made some kind of effort?Action: OK so the plot, script and acting were awful - you can live with that in an action film, right? Well you might be able to if the action were good, but it's not. I can't remember duller, less involving fight sequences. You never think for one moment that Lara is in any danger at all, so there's no tension or excitement, but it hardly matters because Lara rarely gets in a decent scrap. She usually either runs away, hides while others handle the problem, or wins ludicrously easily. When she does actually fight, it's very staid (though in fairness this might be the UK censors' doing).Is there anything good to say about it? Well I suppose if you were absolutely obsessed with Jolie, then the film *might* be worth enduring. Don't get me wrong, she's a nice looking lass, but that's not really going to carry a film. Boy do they try though - at times it seems the plot revolves solely around stairs for her to traverse, blocks for her to jump onto, and corridors for her to run along, whilst the camera tracks her chest's every movement. It's mildly diverting for the first five minutes or so, and then you start wondering when the film's going to start. You'll still be wondering as the final credits roll.Summary: I paid over five quid to see this turgid rubbish, and the only way it'll be worth it is if I can save you all the same ordeal. Please don't see it.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

If you don't go into this movie with a suspension of disbelief and an expectation for ""James Bond""ish action, you will feel like you have wasted money.

I'm a bit irritated that you expect to go in there and see some emotional flick. You're a bit stupid if that's what you had imagined. First of all, it's based on a video game. There's two elements to this fact. 1) You probably won't think it makes alot of sense if you've never played a video game. 2) Whatsmore, who says all action movies have to be realistic? I'm listening to you guys moan about how unreal the movie was, but  ITS A MOVIE. I'm not at all implying however that you should have to play the video games in order to understand the movie. But it helps in this scenario.One last thing, don't whine about how they showed too many breast shots. Lara croft is supposed to be a sexy woman who's not afraid to have her curves be shown. If this makes 14 year old boys like the movie more, so be it. But it's not a sex capade.  I give it a 10/10. Why?

579,voidprime,Not bad for a summer action flick.,8,16 June 2001,People expecting a masterpiece will be disappointed.  You just have to accept it's s summer movie that is there to entertain as a popcorn movie. I liked it.  I just wish it was a little longer.  It's better than The mummy Returns or Pearl Harbor for that matter.  Just be careful about what expectations you have about this movie.  I like this one better than last summer's X-Men which was too slow because they cut the characterization out where Tomb Raider is just balls to the wall action held together by character and plot points to move the story to the next action scene.  I liked this one better than Simon West's two examples of cinematic trash: the dumb Con Air and the really muddled mess called The General's Daughter.,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
580,Kogwheal,Please...Make it stop...,1,14 June 2001,"I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. While I wholeheartedly agree, Angelina Jolie is PERFECT for Lara Croft. And physicality aside, she's a fine actress (Girl, Interrupted, case in point). So why, oh why, did she have to go so completely to WASTE in a movie as depressingly awful as TOMB RAIDER? Was this written by a third grader with a Ouija board, via seance with Ed Wood? The plot is virtually nonexistent, filled with COMPLETELY undeveloped characters who spout dialogue so utterly forgettable it...uh... I don't know what to say about it. I've forgotten it already. There is no motivation. Anywhere. Not for the characters, not for the alleged ""plot"", not for the excessive slow-motion and camera rotation tricks. The film featured a few fairly impressive action sequences, which mostly suffered from poor editing. I heard this movie cost $100 million. Who the heck gave Simon West that much money for this film? Obviously, somebody who failed to see that glaring red flag, CON AIR. And one more thing: how did Jon Voight get mixed up in all this nonsense? Okay. I've made my choice. I'm gonna go cry now.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
581,kellyhanff,This avid Tomb Raider player and Angelina Jolie fan's expectations were met and exceeded.,8,20 June 2001,"I just returned from seeing the flick at Mann's Chinese Theatre, here in Hollywood, and I have to say, I am impressed!Being an avid player and fan of the Tomb Raider games, by Eidos Interactive, I had rather strict criteria for the film, most of which were met, and some were exceeded.First, I have to give a standing ovation to Peter Menzies, Jr. [cinematographer], John Fenner, David Lee, Leslie Tomkins, Su Whitaker [art direction] & the rest of the art department, with special notice of Simon Bowles [concept artist] and Sonja Klaus [set decoration] for the breathtaking visuals.I was particularly impressed by the ""Dead Zone"" scenes at the ice lake, and the Temple designs throughout. As a graphic designer, the visual effect of the colors, shapes and settings chosen were not wasted on me.Chris Corbould, Jeremy Pelzer, Steven Begg and the rest of the Special & Visual Effects departments were equally skilled in their portrayal of truly supernatural events. The most memorable effects scene, for me, was the final scene in the ice lake temple when the stone gods and guardians come to life, surrounded by the light, fire & water explosions of the Planetary Clock. A close tie for second were the opening ""Kill Lara Croft"" training scene and the Midnight Raid scene in Lara's mansion.Now.. for the cast. Angelina Jolie was perfect, but I expected nothing less. Physically, she matched Lara Croft to a tea with her mix of exotic beauty and macho sexiness.The other thing that impressed me was the fact that Jolie, after three months of strict training and high-protein diet, did the bulk of her own stunts, which is no small feat. According to Simon Crane [stunt co-ordinator], Jolie wanted to do even more than she did, but he matched her stubborness and kept her out of direct danger.Enter Jon Voight.. Jolie's real life father, who portrayed Lord Croft, the missing-in-action father of Lara Croft. Though his screen-time was limited, there was a feeling of his presence throughout the production. No doubt, in part, due to his real life connection with the star.In a recent NBC Dateline interview, Jolie said that she and her father had a hard time getting through the dramatic ""tent scene"" towards the end of the film, many aspects of the scene seeming true to life for the pair.The remainder of the cast.. well.. unfortunately, I was not impressed by the performace of Daniel Craig. However, the smaller parts, such as the buddhist monk, the mysterious little girl, and larger parts such as Bryce [Noah Taylor], supported the story-line with ease and skill.All in all, I feel the film met most of my needs for this overly-critical game player. I'm sure it will do quite well for the remains of its run in theatres.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
582,Brian Caraballo,"Not a perfect movie, but a great live version of Lara Croft.",7,16 June 2001,"Ok, I don't know why this movie is getting trashed as bad as it is.  Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a great film.  However it is great fun to watch.  Angelina does a superb job bringing Lara Croft to life.  I have been playing the Tomb Raider games every since the first one in 1996. The film even has the feel of a Tomb Raider game, right down to the quirky bad guys. Believe me, if you are a true Tomb Raider fan, you will not be let down. This movie is an hour and forty minutes of pure entertainment.

583,willeh,An irreplaceable strong character with a stunning pack of action at the most unusual but amazing settings.,10,16 April 2002,"Angelina Jolie, is the sole actress who can be positioned in the strong role of Lady Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider. Lara is famous character based on full action PlayStation serial game Tomb Raider. Lara is the remaining famous character among world gamers with her authentic personality; bold, straight-forward, brave, smart and ready to kick some ass. Lara never answers to anyone, speaks several languages, is surrounded by high-tech, owns a large mansion, and people just love the bathroom scene. Simon West picked every bits that familiar with the character, from deep and cool voice and accent, to the many languages she speaks and even the everyone's favourite scene; the bathroom scene. Angelina Jolie is so Lara Croft. She acted well as Lara and she absolutely kicked butt. Simon grabbed the audience fast and kept them glued until the end. What is so good about the movie? It is more than James Bond or Indiana Jones? Well, since these characters are males, a female hero would be really a shocking breakthru in the industry of adventurer-sort-of-film. It is more than Bond because this lady is a LADY and she kicks ass better than Bond. She jumps, she rolls, she slides, she swings, she runs and she rotates. She bleeds, she DOESNT run away, she wears really short shorts. Is she better than Jones too? She only gets herself in unusual cases, that involves unrealistic event, such as the triangle and the power of the time. She's also smart and knows what she's doing. Why do I comment on Lara Croft more than the film itself? Because this is my personal opinion after I watch the movie several times, I DON'T play the game, but I did see my friends playing it some times ago. This film has got everything; unusual action with a lot of kicking and punching, and still (unlike charlie's angels) cocking the guns are the main idea, Simon West did a great job in making how shooting a robot could be that interesting and a really pleasant scene to watch too, there were no ""matrix"" scene which has the person flies and kicking in slow motion and shows the bullets shooting slowly, no, Simon did it all his way, it also has comedy with Bryce and Hillary, and the short conversation between them are actually funny, the opening sequence really connected with the ending sequence, and more, it has drama, the story about Lara and her father, the story about Lara saving Alex's life and even the scene where Alex was standing naked in front of Lara reveals her character so much. The music was perfect and the story is more than realistic. I beg Simon West to create the second one and please bring Miss jolie back with you.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

It is unfair to compare the two because Indiana Jones has already had a sequel and Tomb Raider has not also Indiana Jones was a man and Lara Croft is a woman! That alone make Tomb Raider a better movie...I'm sure all women agree. Men are just upset because It's hard to believe that a woman can kick butt just as much if not better than any man.

But anyways. I had to give this movie the six. Because I couldn't and give it like 5.4 5.5 it's just the way to say to set up. But I did that for two specific reasons. And that was only because. Now you can take it with a grain of salt if you want but I believe there is a formula to any and all movies that make them believable intriguing and actually makes you want to follow the story. Now don't get me wrong I truly absolutely 100% love unconditionally Angelina Jolie she's one of the best actors female actors that I've seen in a very long time and the story of her going out and finding stuff and like that it's utterly gratifying I mean it's it's wonderful but within that they found her a counterpart within Arnold Rimmer. Which truly me like movie chemistry for me I mean it added logically towards the character the story what they was doing and all like that I do have issues with some of the back story of him and the way that it was betrayed within the movie in a way but once they connected and like that everything you know it it mailed pretty damn good and I mean no it's not the best movie but no lie I may go back to the theater and pay to watch it again if there was a movie with the same formula precisely the way that this was set up.,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

Cool locations, although the ancient city did look like a rejected model from ""Mortal Kombat"".

591,BobSm,"Uh!! Hello people, it's a video game?!",9,18 June 2001,"I find it humorous to read these reviews.  Did anyone realize that this movie is about a video game, with established ways of doing things and a backstory, no matter how slight?  Lara does things a certain way, because that's how she does them in the game.  No one complains when a movie follows the plot of a book without a major re-write, but when a movie about a video game is made we should change the characters relationship to her father, how she moves, what she does?  Obviously she finds objects conveniently, just as she needs them, JUST AS she does in the game!  Obviously, she appears confident and smug instead of scared and ""real"", just as she does in the video game.  If you ever played Tomb Raider, Lara does not quiver in fear as things attack her.  She smirks and blasts away!I really found the reviewer who focused on how the robot was not based in reality or how could they use time travel because it's not real!  Hello!  A video game is not real!  Did you ever hear of science fiction?  You know what, I bet there is not a planet with apes out there, or if you really flew around the South Pacific, I bet you would not find an island filled with dinosaurs that were created from mosquito DNA.  Does this make these movies less enjoyable?  Whatever happened to gold old-fashioned escapism.  You don't sit down at your computer and rip out Tomb Raider to have an intellectual discussion.  You load it up to kick some ass and take names. Contrary to those who think that hard core players would hate this movie because they don't have the joystick in hand, I say you're nuts!  I've played all the versions of Lara and her crazy adventures.  I enjoyed this movie for exactly that.  If you've not played the games, it may not make sense, it's just a weird movie with loose ends.  However, if you have, then maybe you'll notice the little things that did it for me, like how Jolie sighs every time she finds something, just like the game, or how when she stops walking, she stands with here feet apart and in line, or how when main scenes start, the camera will sweep in from behind her and place her full screen in the center.  I think the movie is great at what it was meant to be, a movie version of a video game.  Should Eidos have allowed more license to be used with Lara?  Maybe, but then again then maybe we would have been p***ed at the results.  If you have any interest in this movie, give it a try.  Yes, things appear conveniently, and things are handy when needed, and you know what will happen next, and gee, you know Lara will win in the end.  Do you know anything different when you play the games?  There is a straight progression through the game.  You must find this object and use it with this one to do this.  Once you are done you move to the next level.  In the end Lara wins and you feel great.  Why expect the movie to be different?",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

I know there are a large number of skeptics but I just think this is a good way for young girls to see a woman in control. I am also glad they didn't make it as campy as I thought they would. True they padded Angelina's chest but they could have given her cleavage and less clothing they didn't. They gave Lara Croft dignity.

While a far fetched fantasy, it was extremely entertaining.  The casting of Jon Voight as her father was genius and added a little needed pathos to the plot.

For someone who never talks during movies, I found myself noticing and talking about things such as how they tried (and failed) to cover up a tattoo on Jolie's left arm and how they must have used double sided tape during the bungee scene so that perky parts didn't ruin the child friendly rating.

The Ideas, acting tallent, visual effects are all there but they were never realized.This story could have easily been made into three feature length films with more interest than the condenced version. The movie was caught in between Indiana Jones and The Mummy, lacking in all the areas that these movies pay off.  The effects were good but not spectacular and the fun factor was not there like in the mummy and the plot clarity and characterization did not stand up to Indiana Jones expectation.The characters were paper thin and we never get enough story to make anything believable.

Let me state first and foremost I am NOT a fan in any way of Angelina Jolie and had my doubts about her carrying the role of Lara Croft.  As a huge fan of the video game series, I must say that Ms. Jolie did a fantastic job with the part.  She fit Lara Croft near perfectly, and those are some big shoes to fill.  I was also happy to see that they did not try to emulate one of the games itself in the story, which would have been a failure.  Yes, in some ways, it was like watching the cut scenes of one of the games, but... honestly... that's a MAJOR reason I play the games! I think they did a really good job of giving a personality to the character, which, as we all have seen with other game-to-movie conversions, is not always easy.  One point I thought was extremely impressive was that they did a wonderful job of toning down the ""sex appeal"" of the character and kept her from becoming TOO much of a drool-over for the male audience.  I know, the film was rated PG-13 so they couldn't do TOO much, and for that I'm GLAD!  IMHO, this film was a great adventure film, equally the rival of Raiders.  Lara Croft is depicted as a Bruce Wayne/Indiana Jones-type mix.  Both personalities represented really well.  All I can say is Indy, look out... Lara's on the scene now.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

John Travolta's villain was far superior to the ones in this movie. There was a plot in BF: Earth... Tomb Raider, well... we are still trying to figure if the writers had planned a plot.Tomb Raider, by far, was one of the worst movies we have ever seen. The action scenes lacked coherent action, the story line lacked a story, and the high point of the movie was when my wife and I figured out that the butler was Rimmer from Red Dwarf.More then likely, scenes vital to the plotline were left on the cutting room floor in order to make room for the two shower scenes, which were completely pointless.  The ending was quite anticlimatic, my cat's litterbox is more interesting then all of the character's combined, and we left the theater wondering if the writers were actually third graders coming up with a movie screen play for their favorite video game.By the way, we thought that Battlefield Earth was a bad movie as well.

The action sequences top those that were lavished on The Matrix. She oozes charisma, and sequel-ability.This is the 2001+ female James Bond in the making. We want more!

604,andy_connolly,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be...,8,15 July 2001,"I admit it, I thought I was going to go and see yet another ill-conceived spin off movies, but nope, I was pleasantly surprised.  The all action start grabs your attention, and despite a few 'could see it coming from miles off' moments, the film kept my interest all the way through.  As I was expecting, there was a few ""Ooh, look how sexy Lara/Angelina is"" scenes, like we need to see she was in a shower after a workout, but they managed to steer it away from the T&A aspect that sells so many of the games.  Overall, I'd say for anyone who likes action films, this film is worth a fiver of your money, and don't be put off by the fact it is a tie in",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
605,bigsexylukas,had a weak plot,5,22 July 2001,"I only gave this film a 5 out of 10 due to Angelina Jolie.  The plot was quite horrible, and the ending wasn't good either.  If you want to see this movie to see the hot Angelina Jolie then go ahead, but if you want to see a good action movie do not go see Tomb Raider.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
606,moz_attacks,Lithe is a good word at this point,10,18 July 2001,"Waaah waaah waaah. Or so go the reviews. Whoever thought film reviewers know what they are talking about ? After all the negative bitching about this flick, I sat there expecting my brains to dribble out of my ears, as they did during ""Mummy Returns"". Nonetheless, I spent a very enjoyable time in the company of Angelina Jolie, and though I would be the first to admit that she carries the film, I would also suggest that it's hardly a problem given the title. People have been moaning about the similarity of the film to the video game - why is this a surprise ?  Someone else whined about the debt owed to Harryhausen by the central action sequence - this is a bad thing why ? Others complained of a far-fetched plot - in a fantasy film ! Director Simon West does need to read a book about pacing, and stop writing in committee, since the script is lamentable. However. IT DOESN'T MATTER. I went to see Lara Croft, Tomb Raider - and that's what I got. La Jolie is beyond perfect in the role - lithe, athletic and utterly believable. Her accent is impeccable - shades of the very saucy, slight sibilance of the young Hannah Gordon - and though her uber-breasts seem a little surplus to her adventuring needs, to say she looked the part is massive understatement. Her lascivious grin adds a sly dirtiness to Lara that is missing in James Bond, Indy et al, and the range of her performance is greater than one might imagine, conveying a subtle emotional vulnerability that is belied by her physical presence. Also, she runs properly - which is something that always bugs me in episodes of Buffy. Sarah Michelle Gellar runs like a startled chicken - arms all a-flail - whereas Jolie runs fast and hard, like the athlete she has clearly become during the course of filming. Minor point, maybe, but just one of many things that make Angelina Jolie completely believable as Lara, which is what you need in a film, er, about Lara. I don't know what the nay-sayers were expecting from this flick - some sudden discovery that Lara was fond of Ibsen, or that she was actually Holly Hunter from The Piano, perhaps. I expected stylish Lara action, and I was not disappointed.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
607,ddlweb,Sweet Sweet Angelina,8,19 July 2001,A great film if you're after a simple fantastic sci-fi style adventure.Angelina Jolie is the ONLY choice to play Lara and she does a wonderful job.Rated as my best film of the year so far.,Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
608,e1egy,one of the most original movies I've ever seen...,10,29 July 2001,"...which is pretty sad, considering how very derivative it is.  How can a movie with such a bad script, tacky one-liners, and an obvious rip-off of Indiana Jones be original?  Because of the female star, of course.  Angelina Jolie is perfect as Lara Croft, a woman who really kicks a** (literally, of course!) and never needs to rely on a man to do it.  She's smart, strong, cheerfully independent, and never has to fall back on sex appeal or any so-called ""feminine wiles"" to get what she wants--finally a female action hero girls everywhere can look up to!  Even the requisite shower scene is more than made up for by Daniel Craig's shower scene later in the movie (a real treat for us gals!).  Truly, this was a milestone in the action genre, showing that women can be bad-a** adventurers (NOT adventuresses), too.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
609,craig_owens27,Well. What can I say. A great movie with a great cast!,10,29 July 2001,"Upon reading reviews that I read on the Internet and in numerous magazines and T.V, I was quite apprehensive about going to see the film. I was in for a suprise! This is a really good movie ad I would recommend it to anyone.I was already a big fan of Angelina Jolie since seeing her in ealier films such as Hackers or The Bone Collector but Tomb Raider was certainly her best performance to date. Gone in 60 Seconds was also a superb perfoemance from her. She played the part down to a T. Everything about her is just how you imagine Lara Croft in the Games. Her accent was perfect and the fact that she performed the movie left handed as Lara Croft is left handed in the games. Her looks were also a big factor!Baisically this film is an action fest with some great action sequences and good (but sometimes looking a little dated special effects). There is a feeling of Indiana Jones and James Bond which always makes a good film.The soundtrack is also very good because it often sets the mood of the scenes and gives a good atmospheric feeling which is vital in any film.The script on the other hand could have been better but it wasn't as bad as I thought despite the overuse of the word 'bugger'. Chris Barrie (Red Dwarf) was excellent as the butler Hillary. Jon Voight was superb as Lara's on and Jolie's off screen dad which I thought was an excellent touch because Jolie and Voight could really relate to each other in that scene.Overall, I give this film at least 9.5 out of 10 because I love these kinds of movies. With the cast signed up for at least another 2 sequels and Jolie's apparent commitment to the character and the fact that she would love to play Lara Croft again, I can't wait for the Tomb Raider 2 movie to be released",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

The director set out to do justice to the game and express it to the world and pretty much put Lara Croft into the public eye...and he did just that.I commend this movie greatly and i encourage anyone out there who is willing to give this movie a go to watch it...you won't be disappointed",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider

She, having starred in roles as diverse as a psychopath in ""Girl Interrupted,"" and he, having portrayed a displaced rural dreamer in an urban metropolis in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" the duo perform up to expectations. As is so necessary in an action-adventure, the editing was tight and the sound editing (nominated for many international awards) was tighter.

I can't see anyone playing that part, and I am a big fan of Jolie herself. I've also always loved Lara Croft and the video games and the movie does stay true to the characters and background of Lara Croft.The storyline is interesting but nothing mind tripping. It really gets you thinking about the Illuminati (if you're into stuff like that)From England to Cambodia, Venice and Siberia. All of these locations also fits very well with the storyline.Some people may have issues with the fact that she wears tight fitted tops and short shorts but considering that a good chunk of the movie does take place in a hot Cambodian jungle it really isn't that big of a deal.I definitely disagree with the overall rating on this website of this movie.

627,mccart38,Angelina Jolie becomes Lara Croft,7,19 March 2011,"Paramount has taken the famous video game heroine Lara Croft and transformed her into an action packed movie heroine. Angelina Jolie does a fantastic job portraying Lara Croft and has the opportunity to act alongside her father Jon Voight who plays Lara Crofts deceased father. This is the type of role Angelina Jolie was made for. She brings the action and excitement and does what she is known for; doing her own stunts.Lara is from money and has the luxury of being an adventure seeking tomb raider. This lifestyle and other events take her all across the world in search of ancient artifacts. Along the way put her life is put in danger many times over. As you see in the opening scene she is trained for combat, is not only good with guns, but is also good in hand to hand combat. The female version of Indiana Jones, just in tighter clothes with thigh gun holsters.Every 5,000 years the planets in our solar system go into a planetary alignment. The night this alignment begins Lara finds a clock that has begun to count down. She now must finish her father's work and find the Triangle of Light. She is in a race against time to beat the Illuminati, a secret society, to this artifact that has the ability to control time and space. Alex West, played by Daniel Craig, is another tomb raider but is working for the Illuminati. When the character is first introduced you know there is some history between the two.The film takes the action of the video game and combines it with a weak plot. The film is more about the action, adventure, and excitement you feel from the video game. The action scenes have music that you would expect from video games and get your heart pounding. The soundtrack, mixed with the special effects, is a main focus in the film. The scenes are shot mainly zoomed in on Lara and plenty of gun fire, hand to hand combat, knife fights, falling rocks and debris similar to what you would see in the video game. The film does not have a strong plot or much character development. This is still a must see if you are a fan of the video game or just a fan of action, adventure, and special effects. Make sure to check out the special features on the DVD. This section will show all the training Angelia Jolie went through and also the stunts she was able to do herself.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
628,steven58-6-46662,Film Review for IMDb,7,20 March 2011,"The movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) is an action based video game brought to life with amazing CGI. Tomb Raider the first in a set of movies about a woman, Lara Croft, (played by Angelina Jolie) that takes jobs based on their level of excitement rather than their monetary value or acknowledgment but because she is world known as the best of the raiders. The theme of this movie is focus on plot and the plot of this film is to locate the pieces of the Triangle of Light before it falls into the evil hands of Manfred Powell (Iain Glen). The film starts with Lara fighting a robot designed by her tech buddy Bryce. (Noah Taylor). The purpose of this robot is to challenge her and help train her for her tomb raiding adventures. One night, while dreaming about her father, who went missing in the field, she awakens and is lead to a hidden compartment where she finds a clock that is counting down time. In her search to find out what this clock means she turns to her father's friend Mr. Wilson (Leslie Phillips) during which she runs into a fellow tomb raider Alex West (Daniel Craig). Mr. Wilson refers her to see Powell but during their meeting Lara was able to determine he was a lying about his interest in the clock. The first real action scene in the plot that was not the intro takes place in Lara mansion that night when Powell has his men break in to steal the clock. During this scene the director was able to use an array of techniques ranging from slow motion to jump cuts. The use of these techniques helped the view be attracted to the action and follow the plot. Another action scene that plays a significant role in the plot is when they are in the tomb placing the clock in the puzzle to release the first half of the Triangle of Light. The effects such as lighting and tone helped draw the audience into the scene as if they were standing in the tomb watching all the action. The whole movie was building up to the scene of the alignment of planets and the events that take place at that moment. During this time a sequence of events happen that help explain the main purpose of Lara's intentions. Powell throws a knife and kills West, it is then time stops and Lara is in a different place with her father. She talks with her father and he urges her to destroy the Triangle of Light and not use it to turn back time to bring him back to life. The scene jumps back to the tomb and Lara turns the knife around and it strikes Powell instead of West. The scene ends with an epic fist fight between Lara and Powell, Lara wins the battle and barely escapes the tomb with her own life. The final scene in the movie is Bryce introducing Lara to another robot he built for her for training. The different steps and elements used to create this movie were all part of getting the viewer to focus on the plot of the movie. By the use of the different editing techniques and a creative story line, an action based adventure was created. This movie reminded me of another movie called The Mummy. It's the same basic story line; everyone fights to find the treasure in the tomb. Reference West, S. (2001) Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Los Angeles, California.

629,PhoenixSaiPirate,Well done.,8,17 August 2004,"Good plot, good characters, good Lara. The dominant word here is ""good"". Not ""great"" but certainly ""good"". The movie started with a bang. Lara was immediately in a mysterious setting and soon she was unloading innumerable gun clips into a killer machine from her two Smith & Wesson guns [formerly strapped onto two leg holsters that look curiously like leather guarders(sp?)]. You immediately know that this woman should not be messed with. From there it's mystery, adventure, gun battles and giant globes. Well made, good humor and excellent action (although the fight scenes were a tad bit disappointing). The sequel is a different story, however. The only down side to the first movie is that they got you all revved up for the sequel but the sequel was worse than Charlie's Angels.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
630,SuperLottie,Jolie is the saving grace for Tomb Raider.,6,19 November 2004,"This movie has some excitement but not quite enough to call it a full-on action movie. Nobody else could have played the heroine, Lady Laura Croft, like Ms. Angelina Jolie did. Jolie takes the flat game character and makes it her own. The story is an interesting one but just not the way it was filmed. It was missing a certain something, maybe a little bit deeper into the cult or Lara's past would have ""punched"" it up a bit. Overall, this is the kind of movie that you can just sit back and enjoy and not have to figure out a complex ( Matrix 2 ) storyline that has you trying to find out what who is doing for what reason while you are missing the whole movie. Angelina Jolie is the saving grace for this movie and is the kind you can watch while drawing or painting. In the end, I would give this a 6 out of 10 stars. Good movie.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
631,nick-gillett,An appalling waste of talent and money,3,21 January 2005,"There are many depressing things about Tomb Raider - that it looks so beautiful, but engages so little, that a talent on the scale of Angelina's is wasted on something so empty, and finally that even though everything in the film is in place (great sets, awe-inspiring locations and a plot with sufficient mythical nonsense to make it fun) it just doesn't work. Viewing Tomb Raider is witnessing a void - it's impossible to care about any of the characters, which creates a total absence of tension to the point that it's almost a surreal tension-vacuum in which you actively don't care about anyone or anything occurring on the screen.Whatever spark it is that made Raiders of the Lost Ark so scintillating is notable for being missing utterly from Tomb Raider.

I think this movie is the best of all. Ever since i watched this movie, Angelina Jolie has been my favorite action star.I have collected all her action figures and i still admire them to the same extent i did when i was young. Her style, her voice, her acrobatic skills ,her gorgeous smile still amuses me. I've watched this movie over 7 times and still i long to watch them. So my action superstar has always been Angelina Jolie. But the sequel didn't live up to my expectations. In the sequel Angelina was portrayed somewhat differently that i didn't seem to interest me. So i rate this movie 10/10 .No doubt about that.",Lara Croft - Tomb Raider
