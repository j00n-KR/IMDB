0,TheLittleSongbird,"Interesting and worth watching, but Paul Thomas Anderson's weakest",7,4 July 2016,"Paul Thomas Anderson this reviewer has always considered to be an extremely talented director, and of his films 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood' are particularly wonderful.Before viewing 'Inherent Vice', this reviewer was yet to see a bad film from Anderson with 'Hard Eight still being a very good film. After seeing 'Inherent Vice', although for Anderson it's disappointing and could have been better that feeling still stands. It is completely understandable why people won't like it however, it is not for all tastes and even though 'Magnolia' and 'The Master' are polarising films that test the patience and challenge those who don't like those films 'Inherent Vice' has clearly divided viewers more than any other of Anderson's films.'Inherent Vice' does have its issues. Its biggest problem is the story, which seems to be the biggest flaw for a lot of people (even those who liked or loved the film have acknowledged it isn't as strong as the rest of the film). Here the story is meandering, over-entangled, over-complicated, draggy pace-wise and not very easy to follow, with a lack of pay off. It is adapted from Thomas Pynchon, and despite the noble effort it is living proof that Pynchon is very difficult to adapt and even considered unfilmable.The characters are not the usual realistically flawed or compellingly real characters of most of Anderson's films, here they are not as interesting or as developed apart from Phoenix's character, most of the supporting roles being caricatures. And this is a rare instance of the soundtrack being a disappointment, Anderson's films have always had memorable utilisation of music that are catchy and rich in emotion, but neither is the case here and mood-wise it's too subdued.On the other hand, 'Inherent Vice' is a superbly made film as is always the case with Anderson. As was said in my review for 'The Master', Anderson's films are some of the most visually beautiful and bold around. Exquisitely shot with sumptuous and atmospheric production values, Anderson's trademark visual style shines completely with his distinctive use of constantly moving camera, steadicam-based continuous long takes (a famous example in his films being the opening shot in 'Boogie Nights'), tracking shots and very multi-layered audio-visual imagery. Anderson's direction is superb.The script along with the costumes was Oscar-nominated, and those nominations were deserved, with the costumes being spot-on in representing the era. The script achieves some tremendously funny, often hilarious, moments, as well as an affectingly melancholic tone, balancing both adeptly. The acting is one of 'Inherent Vice's' biggest strengths. While not quite as good as his performance in 'The Master' Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful, while Josh Brolin attacks his role with gusto. Even with short appearances, Witherspoon, Martin Short, Owen Wilson, Jena Malone, Joanna Newsom, Maya Rudolph and Michael K Williams give brilliant supporting turns (Short in particular is a hoot), and Katherine Waterson is unforgettably sensual.Summing up, Anderson's weakest and has its problems, mostly with the story, but interesting and worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Inherent Vice
1,SnoopyStyle,fascinating stylish crime drama,6,8 July 2015,"It's Gordita Beach, California 1970. Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) is a weed-smoking hippie private eye. His ex Shasta Fay Hepworth tells him about her fear that her lover real estate mogul Mickey Wolfmann is going to be abducted by his wife and her lover. This leads to a long winding investigation that connects to a ship called Golden Fang and a drug smuggling ring. Det. Bigfoot Bjornsen (Josh Brolin) is the hard up cop.Paul Thomas Anderson infuse this with a surreal strange hippie hard-boiled vibe. There are good performances. The plot is a meandering thing in a drug induced haze. It's hard and odd. It's a fascinating mood but I never really got involved with the story. Other than Shasta, it's hard to figure out what's in it for Doc in this case. If he saved Wolfmann, wouldn't Shasta live happily ever after with him? Did Tariq Khalil actually pay him? I don't mind a convoluted case but the little things do bug me. When does he get paid? This plot is relatively easy to follow but isn't easy to digest. Characters come in and out of the movie all the time. It's like a semi-coherent dream that stops making sense once you start dissecting it.",Inherent Vice
2,Horst_In_Translation,I was hoping for more,4,3 April 2015,"""Inherent Vice"" is a 2014 film that managed two Academy Award nominations and runs for no less than 2.5 hours. Let me start this review by saying that Joaquin Phoenix was great as always and is a definite contender for best actor out there right now. He really makes every character he plays these days his own. However, the script felt really confusing to me.There were so many interesting characters (especially all the females) in there, but they just weren't elaborated on to a sufficient degree, at least if you have not read Pyncheon's novel like myself. I did like the Witherspoon-Phoenix reunion from ""Walk the Line"" (fittingly Witherspoon also got her 2nd Oscar nomination this year, even if for another film), but I do not like that PTA always has to include his wife in his movies, again in a nothing part and I also don't really see much acting talent in Rudolph. I also do not like the movie's poster. I think Brolin is a good actor and he got some acclaim for his performance here, but his character was also completely confusing and the relationships including him and the villains were weird and unconvincing too. Owen Wilson, as always, did not do anything for me. The film featured basically all ethnic backgrounds. The central character is Italian and there are Asians, Blacks, (very) Whites, Scandinavians etc. and also no crime is omitted: murder, kidnapping, fraud, GBH, drug trafficking...Finally, let me say that without Phoenix this would have been entirely unwatchable probably and I am okay with his Golden Globe nomination. But I was just never wowed by this film, which is particularly disappointing as I really love some of PTA's other work such as ""There Will Be Blood"". I am curious to see if he and Phoenix will collaborate again like in ""The Master"", also a movie superior to this one here. So what could have been done better? Maybe this film should have been released as a miniseries for television and they would have had the running time to elaborate more on the characters to make this a satisfying viewing experience.",Inherent Vice
3,Prismark10,Inherent mess,2,26 November 2015,"Pretty early on I came to the conclusion that Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel Inherent Vice is not for me.However I persevered. I think I should get a medal for bravery.The film is some kind of stoner mystery and comedy. Maybe a spaced out version of Chinatown set in early 1970s LA with a loose plot, plenty of surrealism and cameos from famous actors. If you are looking for a coherent plot then look elsewhere.Joaquin Phoenix plays hazy Private Eye Larry 'Doc' Sportello contacted by an ex girlfriend whose married boyfriend has disappeared, maybe sent to a lunatic asylum by the missing man's wife.Doc gets mixed up with a black militant, a drugged out musician, a drugged out dentist and Josh Brolin as a tough LA cop with a fondness for frozen bananas.The film drags on in its meandering way. I felt Phoenix was miscast, maybe he just tries too hard to be the next Daniel Day-Lewis. Maybe Owen Wilson or even Brolin could had been the lead and brought a different take to the character. Phoenix was boring not helped that the film is boring.",Inherent Vice
4,nogodnomasters,DENTIST ON TRAMPOLINE,10,22 August 2018,"The adventure starts when Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) requests the help of private detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix). Doc is a hippie who spends most of his time doing drugs. During the film he does alcohol, pot, acid, PCP, and cocaine while trying to solve various cases. Shasta is a former girlfriend who left a few months or a few years ago. She tells Doc she is the girlfriend of a married man Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts in a cameo) and his wife (Serena Scott Thomas) and the wife's boyfriend are scheming to get Mickey committed.The story then weaves levels of complexity introducing new characters seeming unrelated to anything. Some characters such as ""Bigfoot"" (Josh Brolin) appear as stereotypes on the surface, but underneath the exterior is someone totally unexpected. At times this makes fun of 60's stoner films but maintains Coen Brothers type of humor throughout. The characters are far from stock. There is humor in the notes Doc takes down in his book. There were plenty of WTF moments and ""what the heck am I watching?"" feelings. It is a film you must either be stoned or fully engaged to watch. I would recommend the latter the first time through.Doc's journey takes him through a dead biker, Mental Asylum (Straight is Hip), Chinese smuggling, Dentist pedophile, massage parlor, and government conspiracy involving the FBI, DOJ and the Aryan Nation. Try to keep up.This is an oddball cult film that won't appeal to everyone.Guide F-bomb, sex, nudity (Katherine Waterston- FF)",Inherent Vice
5,kosmasp,Thinkings man Pain and Gain,8,21 June 2015,"Or something like that. Obviously you cannot compare the movie styles at all, but both ideas are based on something that really happened, with character (read people) ""acting a fool"" (or however else you want to call it). Phoenix playing it as straight and as not ""manly"" as possible (Arnold Schwarzenegger might call his character ""girly girl"" - him not me mind you!).So if you don't have an issue with a character who's probably mostly high (yes on drugs, like on a constant basis or clouded mind) and a story that might be a bit tricky to follow, you'll have a lot of fun with this. Especially considering the acting talent on hand. Also quite a few adult situations as your favorite rating system would call them. The movie is not taking itself too seriously and achieves a lightness within ... can you dig it?",Inherent Vice
6,gavin6942,"Hard to Follow, But Oddly Brilliant",7,16 February 2015,"In 1970, drug-fueled Los Angeles detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) investigates the disappearance of a former girlfriend.Whether or not Los Angeles was like this in 1970 does not matter. For the sake of the story, this is the world Doc Sportello lives in, and it is one crazy place: drug cartels, ouija boards, crooked cops and hippie cults.The problem with this film, and what seems to turn most people off, is the very complex plot. Following in the same vein as ""The Long Goodbye"" or ""The Big Lebowski"", this is a world where many seemingly unrelated worlds intersect. And it is brilliant. Unfortunately, it is very hard to follow and that will ruin it for many people. Or, at best, it will make them want to watch it two or three times until it all starts to click.",Inherent Vice
7,lee_eisenberg,"in life, vices and virtues are bound to collide",6,11 May 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson has shown himself to be one of the most important modern directors over the past twenty years: ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"", ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""The Master"". ""Inherent Vice"" is one of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix plays a hippie detective investigating a disappearance in 1970 Los Angeles. Well, that's the main plot anyway. The movie mixes in as much as possible. But unlike most stories that add too much, I think that it helped this movie: we see a lot of things that were prominent in 1970. There's the Black Guerrilla Family, the protester at Nixon's speech, and other things. It's a pivot between '60s idealism and '70s cynicism.I haven't read the novel on which ""Inherent Vice"" is based, or any other Thomas Pynchon novel. As someone born long after the '60s ended I can't claim to fully understand what the era was all about. It's a pretty bizarre movie, but I'd say that it's worth seeing.A three-hour tour indeed!",Inherent Vice
8,jboothmillard,Inherent Vice,5,27 May 2017,"I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, I was instantly attracted to it by the all-star cast, and it was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, The Master), so I'm glad when I got the opportunity to see it. Basically set in the year 1970, in Gordita Beach in southern California, pot head hippie private eye Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Golden Globe nominated Joaquin Phoenix) is approached by ex-lover Shasta Fay Hempworth (Katherine Waterston). Shasta believes that her new lover, married real estate and land developer Mickey Z. Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), is the target of an abduction attempt by his wife and her lover, they want him committed to an insane asylum. Doc goes in search of Wolfmann, but soon finds other people are going missing, including Shasta, who one of them is assumed to be murdered. Along the way, Doc encounters many crazy characters and a wide array of issues from politics, cults, prostitution, the drug trade and dentistry, and involved with the ""Golden Fang"", an international drug smuggling operation. Accompanying Doc most of the way is LAPD detective Lieutenant Detective Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), who is straight to the point, but does have a dark side, including need for therapy. Also starring Owen Wilson as Coy Harlingen, Reese Witherspoon as Deputy D.A. Penny Kimball, Benicio Del Toro as Sauncho Smilax, Esq., Martin Short as Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, D.D.S., Jena Malone as Hope Harlingen, Joanna Newsom as Sortilège, Bridesmaids' Maya Rudolph as Petunia Leeway, Sasha Pieterse as Japonica Fenway, Michael Kenneth Williams as Tariq Khalil, Martin Donovan as Crocker Fenway, Serena Scott Thomas (Kristin's sister) as Sloane Wolfmann, Jeannie Berlin as Aunt Reet, Hong Chau as Jade, porn star Belladonna aka Michelle Sinclair as Clancy Charlock, Elaine Tan as Xandra, Keith Jardine as Puck Beaverton and Peter McRobbie as Adrian Prussia. Phoenix certainly stands out as the drug addled private eye, then little-know Waterston is impressive, all the other big names in the cast, including the adult actress, add something in their moments too. The film is based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon, his books have been considered unfilmable, and you can see why with this film, is is completely psychedelic and you can hardly concentrate getting entangled with the little storyline there is, but it is memorable for the use of colour and all details of the 1970s setting, a preposterous but interesting enough crime comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Paul Thomas Anderson and Best Costume Design. Worth watching!",Inherent Vice
9,rmax304823,"Far Out, Man.",7,13 September 2015,"This story of a 1970 shaggy private eye (Phoenix) tracking down a missing person among scads of other tasks owes a lot to Thomas Pynchon's novel and about an equal amount to the Cohn brothers' ""The Big Liebowski."" I lost the plot pretty much in the first fifteen minutes, partly because Phoenix's ex girl friend (Waterston) recites her lines in a monotone that's barely above a hoarse whisper. Confusion about narrative threads isn't the kiss of death in this case because the whole film is episodic and involves dozens of characters who may or may not add something to the goings on.Anyway, the enjoyment lies in the weird direction by Paul Thomas Anderson, who I wish would drop his middle name. (Enough is enough.) The performances match the quality of the script, which is pretty good.There is one emblematic scene. Phoenix meets in a restaurant with a prim stranger who is bent on revenge for a tycoon's having debauched his daughter. Phoenix asks dumbly about what the man did. After all, she's of age. The man glowers. Oh, yes? How about his making her listen to all those original cast albums of Broadway musicals while he had his way with her? And taking her to endodontists' conventions -- those hotel rooms. The wall paper. The toilets. Those LAMPS! I won't go on about it. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of a message, thank God, unless it's that every generation looks weird to every other generation. Technically -- photography, art direction -- it's all at professional par. It doesn't move quickly. It just seems to savor every bizarre scene.I kind of enjoyed it.",Inherent Vice
10,Quinoa1984,"a minor film by a major artist - a funny-sad piece of ""Gum-Sandal"" filmmaking",10,11 May 2015,"I haven't read Thomas Pynchon yet, but by the end of Inherent Vice I felt like I got a real sense of what his style (at his most accessible) contains: characters with wonky names, even if they are just minor characters (Wolfmann, Leeway, Bigfoot, Coy, Prussia, and so on), and a sense of paranoia and conspiracy that surrounds much of the proceedings. And while the writing, translated by Paul Thomas Anderson to cinematic use, is often knowingly witty and with double (maybe triple) meanings, and much of it is very funny... there's a great sense of sadness pervading the film, on certain characters faces. Shasta Fay (some of the finest acting from Katharine Waterston) has this look of regret and loss through many of her scenes - some of it may just be a loss of what she could've had with ""Doc"" Sportello (Phoenix), the only doper who didn't/doesn't use heroin. What went wrong? Who knows in this world of private detectives and dames and Nazis? Inherent Vice is presented as kind of a contradiction, which is probably why it was the first Anderson film I didn't love right out the gate, and why it's had trouble with audiences (despite this, an Oscar nomination happened, which was swell). It's the combination of Anderson's choice of direction through most of the film - many long takes, going in slowly in on characters, closing in on their conversations from afar to being close, which is effective - and how it's written; this is a fairly dense plot, with a myriad of characters, presented amid a kidnapping of a real-estate developer, what his wife, her lover, Nazis, a heroin-cartel cult and a loony bin all have to deal with one another, not to mention a ""syndicate"" of dentists, a ship called the Golden Fang, and rock & rollers.And I think I know why Anderson chose this style too - this is a tale of stoners (if not an outright ""stoner"" movie, it's loose if not Lebowski territory), and as such things kind of slow down with the tempo. But notice when there's a flashback to when Shasta and Doc are in a dope dry spell and suddenly the camera-work picks up a little bit. It's a conscious choice of taking things back to the calm, observant 70's filmmaking, closer perhaps to Night Moves than even Long Goodbye, though like Altman, if you notice, the camera rarely actually stops even as it spends minutes at a time in a contained take. Nothing is rushed with the filmmaking, while at the same time we're put along with our intrepid PI a convoluted plot that would make Chandler sit up and go 'Huh""? If there's a fault on Anderson's part, and I say this still loving the movie, is that it isn't an experience that's too clear all the time, and so the audience has to go more than half-way, maybe more like 2/3'rds of the way in to this tale - especially if you aren't familiar with Pynchon's double-meanings and rabid sense of conspiracy about the world we're in. But why it works so well, for those who aren't closed off to a tale of hippie-detective hijinks are because Anderson is still absorbed into making things work as far as casting and emotions. As mentioned there's a certain sadness about some of the film and the characters, and what I liked and responded to so strongly is that for a film seeming to be so loosy-goosy and fun (the trailer, though a masterpiece on its own, was misleading as to what the film is), it takes seriously the decimation of lives due to drugs, the down-effect post-Manson, and the wilting away of any hope of change through the counter-culture. Though a character like Bigfood is a lampoon of hard-nosed, flat-top cops, he IS the future of police work in LA.The acting: Phoenix is wonderful here, if on a different, funnier plane than in The Master. It's an intensity of another kind, and he plays Sportello as a guy who is always trying to keep up - more alert than The Dude, but certainly not all there like a Philip Marlowe - which makes him endearing and a character that I want to follow when watching a story like this. Many actors come and go in the film (among those that stood out for me were Benicio del-Toro as a Marine detective with a cool, know-it-all demeanor, Jena Malone as a newly-dentally-furbished housewife, and of course Martin Short in a showstopper as the ""Chinese"" dentist Rudy Blatnoyd). Brolin, surprisingly, threatens to steal the show, if not doing it, and I was amazed at how much he dug into and had, in his way, a great time playing this hard-nose SOB who has actorly issues (""Extra work's drying up for Bigfoot,"" he laments) and when his story comes to the end, it's a laugh riot. Though still disturbing.Inherent Vice is a long movie, and not one that spoon-feeds the audience directly. It doesn't ask you to take notes or anything but, amid its Neil Young and Can songs, and another great, this time trippy score from Johnny Greenwood, Anderson asks that you're alert and ready for this story, and that it's not just ONE thing. It's a serious tale of the downfall of the 60's while also a lively, sex-and-drug filled romp; it's got some sexy vibes and clothes, but when sex actually happens or occurs off-screen it's startling and bleak. And the romance-that-could've-been at the core is what, for me, makes it a worthwhile experience, past the plot. If it falls shot of Anderson's best, it's still really, really, really good, and I hope to watch it again.",Inherent Vice

Along the way he meets a mixed assortment of characters and takes a lot of drugs...If you saw the trailer for this, you would have been forgiven for expecting a Coen Brothers-like Lebowskiesque stoner-comedy. Yes, it is directed by PT Anderson, who tends to direct dark dramas (eg There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, The Master), but this looked like a departure for him. It is a departure, but not a good one. It's definitely a stoner movie but not anywhere as funny as a Coen Brothers comedy, especially The Big Lebowski. In addition, Inherent Vice lacks coherence, focus or any sense of purpose. There is a central plot, but this doesn't really go anywhere. The movie mostly lurches from one scene to another, gathering new and random characters along the way.It does have some good moments though, but most scenes are just watched with a great deal of puzzlement and, ultimately, frustration and boredom.Maybe, like its characters, you need to be high to enjoy this...",Inherent Vice

13,evanston_dad,Virtually Unwatchable,2,17 January 2015,"I find Joaquin Phoenix to be just about the most repellent actor currently working. I am so physically repulsed watching him on screen that any movie he's in is nearly ruined for me by his mere presence. Much to my dismay, then, was he cast in Paul Thomas Anderson's latest, a director who I usually very much like. Well no matter. Phoenix is repulsive and nearly unwatchable, but the movie is so bad that it would have been terrible even without him in it.""Inherent Vice"" may perfectly capture the spirit of the Thomas Pynchon novel on which it is based (I haven't read it), but that's not especially helpful for audience members who haven't read the book. A film needs to stand alone on its own merits, and ""Inherent Vice"" fails dismally. It's a send up of noir detective films, with Phoenix as the perpetually high PI who bumbles through an intricate and incomprehensible plot. That wouldn't be so bad, because any fan of the kinds of movies to which ""Inherent Vice"" is an homage know that the plots are usually beside the point. Far more important are the atmosphere and vibe. ""Inherent Vice"" is full of vibe, I'll give it that, but that's unfortunately all it's got to offer, and if you don't happen to care for the vibe (which I didn't), then the two-and-a-half hour film feels interminable.Josh Brolin is kind of fun in a few scenes as an uptight police officer, but I can recommend pretty much nothing else about this major disappointment.Grade: D-",Inherent Vice
14,ferguson-6,Thinking Comes Later,7,11 January 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. What is an absolutely critical element to a good whodunit? The answer is ""it"". By definition there must be an ""it"" that someone has performed or carried out. Director Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel kicks off with a terrific scene that appears to set the stage for a big mystery that must be solved. But don't fall for it  it's really a parody of film noir that depicts the end of the care-free hippie era in southern California. Or maybe it's the beginning of the paranoid era in southern California. Or maybe it's something else all together. Whatever it's meant to be, it is certainly a wild ride with a never-ending stream of colorful characters in strange situations.Many of us consider Paul Thomas Anderson to be one of the true creative geniuses of the film world. His 2007 There Will Be Blood was a towering achievement and complements his other films such as The Master, Magnolia, Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, and the underrated Hard Eight. His latest veers into new territory and features one of his more outlandish characters in ""Doc"" (Joaquin Phoenix), a mutton-chopped hippie Private Investigator who never misses a chance to indulge in his marijuana habit. Welcome to 1970 SoCal.It seems new characters and scenarios are being thrown at us in every scene, as Doc readily accepts new cases and new leads  only there really is no case, even though he spends most of the movie looking into things. His efforts find him crossing paths with his ex-girlfriend, the wife of a missing real estate tycoon, the Aryian brotherhood, a sax player who is either a Federal informant or a student dissident, a coke-fueled dentist, an Asian massage parlor, the FBI, a maritime lawyer, his pizza-delivering sometimes girlfriend who is also a District Attorney, a mysteriously named entity Golden Fang, and the tightest-wound/probably corrupt/ TV-acting police detective named Bigfoot.Should you require additional weirdness, check out how many character names come right out of cartoons (Doc, Mickey, Bambi to name a few). Need more? How about a soundtrack that features Neil Young, Sam Cooke, Can's ""Vitamin C"", and a score from Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood? There is just no describing the shenanigan's other than to say the characters, situations and dialogue are alternatingly confounding and humorous. Our movie-watching brains are trained to follow a plot, but Anderson and Pynchon seem to be laughing in the face of this tradition as we try to assemble the nominally related puzzle pieces.The cast is varied and fun. Katherine Waterston (Sam's daughter) plays Doc's ex who kicks off that first scene, Eric Roberts is the kinda missing rich guy, Michael Kenneth Williams delivers a clue, Benecio Del Toro is the maritime lawyer, Owen Wilson is the sax player, Jena Malone is his clean and sober wife, Reese Witherspoon plays the DA, Martin Short is the horny dentist, Martin Donovan is another creepy rich guy, Joanna Newsome is the narrator and periodic assistant to Doc, Serena Scott Thomas (sister of Kristin Scott Thomas) plays the wife of the missing rich guy who is played by Eric Roberts, and Maya Rudolph (the director's real life partner) is Doc's receptionist  and Maya's late mother Minnie Ripperton sings ""Les Fleurs"" on the soundtrack. But it's Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin who really take this thing to the edge. It's clear both are having fun, which is the best you can hope for while watching this one.",Inherent Vice

In helping her, Doc not only goes on a search for her lover, but others whom also go missing, including Shasta, and one who is assumed to be murdered. Doc gets involved with a wide array of issues from politics, cults, prostitution, the drug trade and dentistry, much of it surrounding the mysterious Golden Fang unit. Also along for this psychedelic trip is detective Christian Bjornsen, known as Bigfoot to most, straight-laced on the outside, but who has a dark underside, which is clearly evident to Doc.......There is no doubt that PTA is an absolute genius, and since Hard Eight, he has had made nothing but genuinely brilliant movies, and Punch Drunk Love, which just didn't click with me.But every quality director has the occasional misstep, Spielberg had 1941, Eastwood had most of the Eighties, and now PTA has this movie, and I'm only being honest,the film is all over the place, and this is the third chance I've given the film.Its a rare thing when I have to watch a film again and again before I review it, and this is that rare case. Everyone seems to love it, the reviews from critics and likewise reviewers are glowing, so I was thinking to myself 'am I that stupid as to not realise that this is a work of art?'.And then it came clear to me, I'm just honest, I'm not a lemming jumping on the thumbs up bandwagon just to be the majority, in fact, the most positive thing I got from this film is not to care what others may think of my opinion, it's any opinion after all, it can't be wrong.....The film starts of well enough, and Phoenix is as good and reliable as he ever is. And then the bafflement starts, too many characters are introduced too soon, and we are left with long periods of absolutely nothing going on other than PTA trying to channel a Lynchian arc to his narrative.People, come, people go, Brolin, as bonkers as he is, is just Agent K from MIB III, and by the end of the what seems endless running time, you get nothing but an empty feeling of 'Really?' , and Phoenix breaking the fourth wall and giving the audience a smug look.On the plus side, it looks brilliant, the camera-work is elegant, and Martin Short is nothing 'short' of genius when given good material, much like Witherspoon.But all in all, its a crushing disappointment, narratively all over the shop.Will leave you scratching your head, thinking 'what's up Doc?'In-Meh-rent Vice, if you would.But it's just my opinion.",Inherent Vice

Eggs break, chocolate melts, glass shatters'",5,14 March 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, The Master, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood) put his stamp on the writing of Thomas Pynchon's vision and nostalgia for the hippie era, created a zany screenplay and directed this rather confusing mess of a film. True, it is an Anderson- junkie's dream, but the story is so beaten to death with voice-overs and conflicting lines and plot directions that what is left is a hint a Pynchon's writing genius and some very well drawn caricatures by talented actors.

From there the plot goes all over the place, all through the cannabis cloud that blurs the storyline to a great extent.Joaquin Phoenix was made to play this role and the rest of the cast includes a very fine ""Bigfoot' by Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Owen Wilson, Michael Kenneth Williams, Maya Rudolph, Reese Witherspoon, Martin Short, etc. Beware of a lot of crude dialogue and innuendos and outright bad taste, but if all of the above is to your liking you'll probably make it through this VERY long movie.",Inherent Vice
17,zetes,"Difficult to follow, but still thoroughly enjoyable",9,13 January 2015,"Hell if I could follow the actual plot line of this movie, but I still found it incredibly entertaining. Based on a recent Thomas Pynchon novel, it's very much in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, but set in the 1970s (so The Long Goodbye will be very much on your mind). Joaquin Phoenix stars as Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, a hippie private investigator who consumes marijuana like Popeye does spinach. When his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) shows up telling him about a sinister plot involving her new beau (Eric Roberts), Doc is set on a dangerous pathway. A multitude of fun characters are met upon the way. Josh Brolin plays the yang to Doc's yin, a straight-laced cop nicknamed Bigfoot who does acting work on the side. Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Benicio del Toro and Jena Malone play other major characters. Perhaps the most amusing cameo belongs to Martin Short, who plays a drug-addicted dentist. Folk singer Joanna Newsom is very good, in her first movie role, as the story's narrator (she's given by far the most difficult lines in a movie full of difficult dialogue) and Doc's mysterious friend. Of course, as a PT Anderson movie, it barely has to be said that the filmmaking is beyond brilliant.",Inherent Vice
18,deloudelouvain,So boring I had problems staying awake,3,30 March 2015,As much as I normally love crime/mystery movies I am disappointed by this one. It goes beyond my comprehension that this movie rates seven stars. If you like stoners with extremely dirty feet talking more then two hours non stop with almost zero percent action then this movie is for you. But for me it was a total letdown. I normally love Joaquin Phoenix but in this movie I got bored after fifteen minutes. And the more the story went on the more I had problems to stay awake. Much too much characters in a story that is not interesting at all. If I were you I would not go see this movie in a theater because that is money thrown away. There are way better movies to watch in the theater right now. And even on television this one is not worth watching. Huge disappointment!,Inherent Vice
19,christopher-underwood,Didn't even notice the length!,10,10 November 2018,"Whilst being a complete no, no for those who love a clearly mapped out and coherent narrative structure, for the rest of us, sit back and enjoy. Of course there are stunning moments where we shall have to sit up and thought there is both the Paul Thomas Anderson look of the thing plus his amazing control of numerous participants who all seem to give their all. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant here, he completely inhabits his role and seems to force the rest of the film to go around him. Katherine Waters is a revelation and the scenes with the two of them crackle with excitement and anticipation. The whole complex rolling mass of a film that revels in its 1970 Californian setting amazes with the extent of the drug taking and how far it had permeated into many parts of American society as it never did in the UK. At times I felt I was sharing a spiff with the characters so dreamlike and surreal this swirling and spinning film is. Brilliant film making and great viewing experience.

20,namashi_1,Paul Thomas Anderson's Bizarre Masterstroke!,9,11 January 2015,"Based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Pynchon. 'Inherent Vice' is a yet another Bizarre Masterstroke by the genius of the niche, Paul Thomas Anderson. A ""high"" crime-comedy-drama, that unfolds absurdly & ends abruptly, but its all done so distinctively, that its hard not to love the film. Even the performances by its fantastic ensemble, make 'Inherent Vice' even better. 'Inherent Vice' Synopsis: In 1970, drug-fueled Los Angeles detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello investigates the disappearance of a former girlfriend.'Inherent Vice', despite its absurdity, is a laugh-riot at times. Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, the drug-fueled protagonist, is a fascinating, funny man, whose journey is perpetually full of twists, & probably even, hallucinations. Even the supporting characters, though all twisted & also on some drug, are so deliciously wicked, that its impossible not to like them. Anderson creates a world of madness & dope, a world where being ""high"" is the only way out. 'Inherent Vice' captures the essence of the yesteryear's & the quirkiness it followed.Anderson's Adapted Screenplay is many things, its a commentary on deception, laced with superb humor, as well as offering some true thrills. Its consistently zoned-out & also, entertaining. Anderson's Direction captures the mood of 'Inherent Vice', most admirably. Cinematography by Robert Elswit is perfect. Leslie Jones's Editing is sharp, despite a long running time of 148-minutes. Performance-Wise: Joaquin Phoenix as Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, delivers a sensational performance. Totally drugged & wasted, Phoenix remains true to his character & passes off with flying colors. Josh Brolin is first-rate & also the film's silliest joke. Katherine Waterston is simply awesome. She adds more intrigue to the narrative each time she appears on screen, thanks to her superlative act. Owen Wilson is effectual enough. Reese Witherspoon is natural, as ever. Benicio del Toro is restrained. Jena Malone is in great, chirpy form. Martin Short is outstanding in a brief role. On the whole, 'Inherent Vice' is quite a ride! It may not please all, but the fanatics of Anderson's vision, like me, shouldn't complain for anything more. Very Strongly Recommended!",Inherent Vice
21,lasttimeisaw,"PTA is never compromising, but this film belongs to a different era",6,16 June 2015,"Before watching Paul Thomas Anderson's latest labour-of-love, I am quite puzzled how come this film hovered under the radar almost entirely in the past Oscar season, since PTA is pretty much in his heyday both in his career path and artistic creativity after THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007, 9/10) and THE MASTER (2012) , with only two minor Oscar nominations (Adapted Screenplay and Costume Design), its box office journey is also underperformed, a meagre $8 million after its domestic run. As I am no expert on American literature, so the name Thomas Pynchon doesn't ring any bells to me, but after reading the basic synopsis, it is a story with great potentials, it could be an intricate crime procedural, with a dopey PI Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Phoenix) in L.A. as our resourceful, street-smart protagonist. However once viewers like me have been transported into a world of the 1970s vernacular of hippies and stoners, which I personally don't have any connections with, thanks to PTA's prosaic tactic, a disarray is aggravated by sundry characters' drawling intonations and the tonally languishing story-building, the film encompasses a convoluted plot, nevertheless, audience (especially for the ones like me where English is not our native tongue and totally oblivious of the novel) can hardly acquire a lucid clue of what is happening as it is mostly divulged through confabs among sundry characters, and quite difficult to collage all the loose ends to a comprehensive picture, so running against 148 minutes, the torpor will eventually catch you sooner or later. Shot in 35mm film, INHERENT VICE is a visually breathtaking achievement, recaptures the ethos of its epoch, grafts its richly retro hue with a meandering narrative to envision a cinematic recreation opportune to the past era. The performances are also scattered half- heartedly as if all is enveloped in a smoky haze, Phoenix is a devoted thespian no wonder, but strangely no strong personality has been squeezed from Doc's idiosyncrasies, he is so ordinary and insentient to lead audience on. Among a vast supporting cast with many veterans, Brolin's police officer Bigfoot steals the limelight completely in his more idiosyncratic bravado beyond his character's murky motive which unfortunately one couldn't care less in a long run. Katherine Waterston, the daughter of Sam Waterston, harnesses her breakthrough role as Shasta, Doc's ex, who is the main intrigue and pops up haphazardly to light up the screen, muttering wistfully with nothing concrete to elucidate her incentive, but the postures alone, is galvanising enough to earn a pat on the back, not to a lesser extent, in her stunt of denuded rawness Narrated by Doc's confidante Sortilège (singer Newsom) in her dolce cadence, and vitalised by a soundtrack of that time, eventually INHERENT VICE never conquer me as PTA's previous works, a career debacle may be overstretched, hopefully it is just an inherent retreat before embarking on something more organic to his proved artistry!",Inherent Vice
22,Hellmant,About as incoherent and hard to follow as any movie I've ever seen!,8,15 January 2015,"'INHERENT VICE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's new comedy-drama crime flick; based on the book, of the same name, by Thomas Pynchon. It tells the story of a hippie P.I. investigating several different crimes, in 1970, including the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend. It stars Joaquin Phoenix, Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Benicio del Toro, Sasha Pieterse, Jordan Christian Hearn, Jena Malone, Martin Short, Martin Donovan, Eric Roberts, Serena Scott Thomas, Michael Kenneth Williams and many others. Anderson wrote and directed the movie and it's the first feature film ever adapted from one of Pynchon's books. The story is an incoherent mess and the film is pretty painful to sit through, at times, but it's also highly enjoyable in other moments. Certainly not one of Anderson's best films but it should become a cult classic.The story takes place in 1970 Los Angeles and it revolves around a private investigator, named Larry 'Doc' Sportello (Phoenix). At the opening of the movie, he's visited by his ex-girlfriend, Shasta Fay Hepworth (Waterston). Shasta tells Doc about a plot to have her current boyfriend, a rich real estate developer named Mickey Wolfmann (Roberts), kidnapped and thrown into an insane asylum; by his wife (Thomas) and her current lover. Doc agrees to investigate it and things keep getting crazier from there; as more and more quirky characters and bizarre situations keep being introduced. Doc is also a hippie and a drug lover, so the entire film is played out like a psychedelic comedy/nightmare. Anderson has said he tried to make the movie like a Cheech & Chong flick, filled with as many great dick and fart jokes as he could cram into it. I absolutely love the look and feel of the film; Anderson's stylistic approach, to the material, has never been better. I also love Phoenix's performance and think the supporting actors were all perfectly cast as well; Waterston and Brolin are especially memorable (and Waterston and Thomas are both pretty stunning, and cute, in the film too). My biggest problem with the movie is just that I had no freaking clue what was going on, for almost it's entirety. The film is about as incoherent and hard to follow as any movie I've ever seen. At nearly two-and-a-half hours long, that's a pretty frustrating film to watch. It had so much promise though and with some editing, and a lot of fine-tuning, it could have been a classic. So it's just really disappointing that it had so much potential, to be truly great, and it was all wasted. A lot of the actors say they had no idea what they were doing, or what was going on in the film, either. They say they had faith in Anderson though. Fans of his (and Pynchon) say it's pretty faithful to the book too, and that it'll get better (and easier to follow) with repeat viewings. I think a really great film shouldn't require that much work though, especially not a psychedelic comedy crime flick! It is really funny, at times, but it's kind of depressing, and frustrating, too. Maybe I should have been drunk or stoned before I saw it; I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more, but I doubt I would have understood it any better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/O9KTvaLDibs",Inherent Vice
23,paul2001sw-1,Too much,7,28 April 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson has a tendency to make films on an epic scale, and 'Inherent Vice' is no exception. It's kind of like a cross between 'The Big Lebowski' and 'Chinatown', the tale of a stoner detective but in a story that's bitter rather then humorous; another touchstone might be Robert Altman's 1970's filming of Raymond Chandler. Indeed, not only is the movie set in the 1970s, but in many ways it feels like a film from that decade: the subject matter, and the sense of an old order that will either die in the face of rebellion or reinvent itself in the nastiest of ways, is a common theme from the movies of this era. The plot is complex, and the layers are cleverly revealed, although there's a sense that there's no true bottom to this mystery. But the film is unquestionably overlong, and as always in these tales of the nearly-disillusioned but not quite defeated detective, the question of why he cares so much is never quite satisfactorily answered. And for me, Anderson remains a strange phenomenon: a great film-maker, who has never quite made a great film. His relatively small-scale debut, 'Hard Eight', remains my favourite of his movies.",Inherent Vice
24,MOscarbradley,Absolutely essential,9,16 February 2015,"""Inherent Vice"" is the first outright comedy that Paul Thomas Anderson has made and it's only the second film he's made based on someone else's work, (in this case Thomas Pynchon, whose dialogue he has faithfully reproduced). Consequently the film has been somewhat side-lined and underrated so while it may not be ""Magnolia"", ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""The Master"" it is still head and shoulders above anything else out there at the moment. The plot may be virtually impenetrable, (but then who gives a toss about plot these days), yet as a snapshot of a drug-fueled LA in 1970 this is close to priceless. If Anderson was Altman in a previous life then this is his ""The Long Goodbye"" by way of Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"".When I said the plot was impenetrable I think I should have said it was more or less irrelevant since it is easily summed up in the opening and then conveniently disappears down a rabbit-hole. 'Doc', (a terrific Joaquin Phoenix), is a spaced-out PI 'hired' by former girl-friend Shasta, (newcomer Katherine Waterston), to track down missing billionaire Michael Wolfmann, (Eric Roberts), whom she believes has been kidnapped by his own wife. He isn't very far into the investigation when he wakes up beside a corpse and finds himself surrounded by the fuzz, chief among whom is one Bigfoot Bjornsen, (a never better Josh Brolin). After that you really need to pay very close attention or just go with the flow as more and more characters slip in and out of the frame and an organization called 'The Golden Fang' begins to loom large. Oh, and I did mention this was a comedy and a very funny one, too. It's the kind of surreal, psychedelic comedy movies don't do these days and in that respect it's another throwback to independent Ameriican movie-making in the seventies.As well as Phoenix and Brolin, both at the top of their game, there is Reese Witherspoon as a promiscuous Assistant DA, an amazing Martin Short as a very peculiar dentist, (and on screen for much too short a time), Owen Wilson as some kind of whistle-blower, (at least I guessed that was what he was), not to mention cameos from the likes of Jeannie Berlin and Jefferson Mays. It's a fun film though it might confound Anderson devotees and anyone who thought him incapable of doing anything other than ""The Master"" or ""Magnolia"" and, of course, it looks the part. As well as being a great writer, Anderson has always been a great visual stylist and here DoP Robert Elswit imbues the film with a Vilmos Zsigmond hue. Yes, this is a film that isn't just set in 1970 but which could have been made then, too. It may not be Anderson's best work but it is absolutely essential nevertheless.",Inherent Vice
25,dromasca,viciously long and confusing,4,6 June 2015,"You should be warned that 'Inherent Vice' is very different of what it is marketed to be. If you expect to see the detective story advertised by trailers better give up from start. Based upon a book or books by Thomas Pynchon the film is very disappointing as a thriller despite involving such huge talents like director Paul Thomas Anderson or actors Joaquin Phoenix and Benicio del Toro. I cannot even call 'Inherent Vice' a bad movie because there are a few moments of humor and charm, and because Phoenix acts with passion and empathy, so I will just confess that I found the film too long and extremely confusing.Missing first before all in this film is a coherent story. What happens on the screen action-wise does not seem to have been the focus of director Anderson, neither telling the story in a fluent manner. Characters keep appearing and disappearing not only for detective reasons, whatever happens is based upon coincidences and the links between the different threads and characters are unclear or seem to lead nowhere. Phoenix plays a hippie version of Marlowe in 1970, and the characters around are mostly stereotypes of that era. There is too little fun and too little thrill to compensate the long and incoherent story though.It's easy to fall for Joaquin Phoenix who is such a great actor and seems to have enjoyed acting in this film. The 70s are described less than the time of flowers power and birth of all good music we ever heard, and more like the moral swamp that generated the America of today. I found however the critical social view as not too engaging, after all it's 40 years since Nixon went home, and it certainly cannot compensate the sometimes painful experience of watching this film. Despite all the talent invested (or should I say wasted?) in it, I believe that I am making a public service advising friends and foes to avoid it.",Inherent Vice

It's a very entertaining movie that serves as a terrific mystery that dosen't exactly thrill or contain much suspense, but the character development is terrific, a relationship between Doc with many other characters is showcased throughout the film, which I found to be the most appealing part, he is a complicated man and the communications with others throughout prove that. The only real problem that bothered me was that the plot wasn't coherent enough, a lot of the scenes made little logic and had nothing to do with actually moving the story forward, it's a two hour and thirty minute long film and I honestly felt there was about forty minutes that were completely unnecessary. The cast is outstanding and makes this film the enjoyable ride it is, Joaquin Phoenix shines in the lead role, he's in literally every scene and I never felt sick of him, his characterization as Doc was brilliant, and he is joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon and Owen Wilson. Though it's not without its flaws, Inherent Vice makes up for it with stellar character development and a terrific cast, I would recommend Inherent Vice to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film.

29,sol-,Seventies Sizzle,5,8 February 2017,"Hired to investigate a mysterious disappearance, a 1970s hippie private detective's search efforts are hampered by oddball characters, the allure of drugs and 'free love' in this offbeat crime drama from Paul Thomas Anderson. With dissolve and overlap edits in plentiful supply, as well as Oscar nominated costumes that are both true to the era and inventive, 'Inherent Vice' is as good-looking a film as any by Anderson - yet with many mixed reviews out there, it has proved to be one of his most divisive films with event ardent fans turning their back. The dislike is understandable. The film is populated with so many principal characters that there is never the chance to know any of them in any depth, not even the protagonist. Much of the film is also accompanied by voice-over narration that does little other than spell out what could easily be surmised. At the same time though, the film has at least a couple of remarkable performances. While he does not have much of a character to work with, Joaquin Phoenix's acting range is incredible when one considers that the milquetoast star of the previous year's 'Her' is the same actor playing the disheveled PI here. Josh Brolin also brings some welcome comic relief with his hard-nosed police detective who has a soft spot for ice cream treats and who may not be as different from Phoenix as initial appearances would have it. Whether these two notable performances are enough to support a rambling two-and-a-half hour feature is debatable though, and this is therefore a film best approached with caution.",Inherent Vice
30,tomgillespie2002,"If you find yourself scratching your head, it really doesn't matter",8,17 July 2015,"Following in the footsteps of Raymond Chandler and the Coen brothers' Chandler homage The Big Lebowski (1998), Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel of the same name, Inherent Vice, has its permanently perplexed gumshoe trying to navigate his way through a labyrinthine plot that never really makes sense. Joaquin Phoenix's mutton-chopped 'Doc' Sportello is rarely too far away from his next joint in a hungover 1970's, where free love and hippydom is starting to fade and Richard Nixon reigns in the White House. The plot plays second fiddle to the hazy atmosphere and distinct sense of place, so if you find yourself constantly scratching your head as the story 'unfolds', it really doesn't matter.If Paul Thomas Anderson's work is noticeably divided by 2007's masterpiece There Will Be Blood, when his work seemed to transform from absorbing, oddball ensembles (and even an Adam Sandler comedy) into sweeping, completely hypnotic works of art, Inherent Vice is a curious combination of the two era's. While never spilling over into full- blown comedy, the film makes frequent use of slapstick and moments of surreal absurdity, all delivered with perfect comic timing by its extremely talented cast. However, there's something else going on; a bigger picture that Anderson never really grasps (and doesn't really need to), and an eeriness that may or may not be fuelled by Doc's drug-induced paranoia and bewilderment.The story kicks off when Doc is visited by old flame Shasta Hepworth (Katherine Waterston), who informs Doc of her affair with real estate developer Mickey Z. Wolfmann (Eric Roberts) and a possible plot to kidnap and commit him to a mental asylum. Doc's investigations force him into constant conflict with former colleague Lt. Detective 'Bigfoot' Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), a buzzcut- donning hippy-hater, who assists Doc with the news that Wolfmann has disappeared without a trace. Doc is also tasked with locating two others - a member of the Aryan Brotherhood who owes money to Black Guerilla Family member Tariq (Michael Kenneth Williams), and missing husband Coy (Owen Wilson), whose wife Hope (Jena Malone) has been informed of his death. The cases all may be linked by a mysterious boat known as the Golden Fang.The head-scratching antics and doped-up conversations can cause extreme brain fatigue at times, so this is far from Anderson's best work. But Inherent Vice is still distinctly the work of Anderson, who wraps the film in an unpredictable and unsettling atmosphere at times, with the favouring of close-up's, a technique adopted in The Master (2012), heightening the deliriousness of the experience. The real find here is undoubtedly Waterston, whose twist on the femme fatale is played with a free-spirited seductiveness that would drive most men crazy. Phoenix is predictably convincing as the permanently red-eyed and well-meaning private dick, and Brolin overshadows anyone in the same room as him with his intense and idiosyncratic stiff, demanding waffles in bawled Spanish and deep-throating a popsicle much to Doc's disgust. Anyone expecting to be satisfied come the climax may be disappointed, and, like The Master, it can be difficult to love at times, but Inherent Vice is a one-of-a-kind experience; constantly baffling, funny, frustrating and beautiful.",Inherent Vice

32,eddie_baggins,"A journey to the land of 'strange"" that's unlike any other",8,11 March 2015,"It's a strange feeling to get after watching a Paul Thomas Anderson flick, but his latest odyssey (this film is a very long 2 and a half hours), Inherent Vice, is a film that will leave you cold and empty even though it possesses most of the qualities we've come to expect from PTA as one of the modern eras most accomplished and unique filmmakers. Adapting Thomas Pynchon's seemingly un-filmable book of the same name is likely the reason for why Inherent Vice feels like a well-made trip into nothing and is also perhaps where the film succeeds most in its telling of a tale that just may well exist to frustrate and entertain in equal measure.I challenge anyone to absolutely gather what is going on in this depraved tale of informants, tycoons, hippies, FBI agents, boats and crazy dentists among other things, as it's nigh on impossible to keep a track of what's going on about halfway through the movie and by then you'll know if your digging this wild ride or wanting out and I suggest that many may find the film almost irredeemably unwatchable even though it's one of the finest recreations of the 70's seen in the last few years. From the sporadic song listings, the fine dream like cinematography (with added smoke) from the always impressive Robert Elswit and the often haunting score from Radiohead member Jonny Greenwood, Inherent Vice presents a finely produced veneer but no matter the values of this or the impressive acting turns there's nothing to transform the material into anything classic, which we have now come to expect from PTA.After great success together in a professional sense with their collaboration on the Master, it's fantastic to see Joaquin Phoenix (with the wildest facial hair seen on screen in some time) and PTA work together once more and Phoenix is on impressive form as Doc, a The Dude like character that just wants simple things from life but ends up in all types of sticky situations. Phoenix's comedic timing and physical prowess for such material is a highlight of the film's acting trope and his play offs with Josh Brolin's hard fisted Detective ""Bigfoot"" and Owen Wilson's unwitting snitch Coy Harlingen provide some of the films best singular moments. There are however others in the cast that feel quite short-changed. From Reese Witherspoon to Benicio Del Toro through to the cameo of Martin Short, many appearances in the film feel like mere novelty value where the film could've done with more memorable side players. It's a big spanning tale that feels like it features a few to many empty vessels, there for nothing more than to complicate proceedings further.Inherent Vice looks and sounds fantastic, it has some very fun performances and is unlike anything you've likely ever seen but it also feels like a massive underuse of directing talent and acting talent that could've been so much more. From all reports it sounds like Inherent Vice is almost the perfect adaptation of Pynchon's source novel yet that doesn't mean it makes the film any better when taken on face value. Watchable (if overlong) and often weirdly funny, Inherent Vice is without question a lesser Anderson work (that many other directors would claim as one of their best) that is likely to remain one of his weaker films in a filmography that would be the envy of many counterparts.4 chocolate coated bananas out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Inherent Vice
33,leonblackwood,Storyline was a right mess! 3/10,3,14 June 2015,"Review: I really tried my hardest to get into this movie but the storyline was a right mess. In every scene the writer introduced a new character which made it confusing and hard to keep up with. I totally lost the plot after a while and I kept on forgetting people's names, which made it harder to follow. Its based around the hippy days during the 60's, when people believed in sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. Doc Sportello is a private investigator/doctor who gets a mysterious visit from his ex-girlfriend, who seems like she's got a lot on her mind. She tells him about her strange relationship with a billionaire whose also a land developer and has a wife whose also having an affair. He then finds out that the billionaire has gone missing and after some investigating, all the clues lead to this mysterious boat/cult called the Golden Fang. There are other elements to the storyline but it's just to hard to explain. Personally, I lost interest after a while because there was just too much going on and there weird way of speaking just got too much. I liked the different characters, like Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson and the Chinese girl who played Doc Sportello's snitch but I just couldn't keep up with it. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in the lead and he made the character seem very realistic but his mumbling and weird expressions made the film harder to follow. There are some great cameos, like Reese Witherspoon, Eric Roberts and Martin Short but they only had a few scenes. Anyway, this film would have brilliant if they didn't over complicate the storyline but it sadly has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!Round-Up: This has to be the worst box office takings for Paul Thomas Anderson, who usually makes some great movies. I really liked Magnolia, Boogie Nights and the great There Will Be Blood but I wasn't a big fan of the Master which also started Joaquin Phoenix. Its hard to think that this great director has only made 7 major movies in his career and he really does get the best out actors, especially Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Anyway, Joaquin Phoenix is obviously not concerned with stardom, judging by the weird projects that he takes on. He was great in Walk The Line and Gladiator and I couldn't see anyone else playing the lead in Her of I'm Still Here. He really does have a unique approach and style to acting which usually works in most of his movies but I couldn't get to grips with it in this film.

Paris, 1968.",9,29 January 2019,"When supporting actor Josh Brolin mentioned in interviews that he himself didnt understand what the story was about, then you cant say you havent been warned about the vagueness of this plot. Vagueness, confusion and suggestions going nowhere are abound in this story, up to a point that not knowing where the story will go becomes the main focus by itself. But this confusion is as enjoyable as I have ever been confused, by not understanding what the story is all about.With this story we descend into the deepest and weirdest thoughts of the doped out mind of Joaquin Phoenix, who is a private investigator in the sixties, investigating something, and while doing that he meets a lot of other mysterious doped out people, having mindblowingly vague dialogues. Joaquin Phoenix steals the show with his hippie impersonation. He is THE DUDE! For any fan of his work, this is a must see, even if you dont like the movie's plot.This movie can be best enjoyed as if one were on a pot induced kind of trip. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, like no other American director has got the talent to confuse, distort and question things. It is a real gift to leave the cinema with more questions than one had during the start. It is as if ""Inherent Vice"" gave me a dope trip, with only silver screen visuals as the ingredients which got me high.If you like to be dazed and confused as well, this is one of the best visual silver screen trips I can think of...""Under the paving stones, the beach!""

36,BeneCumb,Protracted and pretentious movie elevated by good performances,6,26 February 2015,"Although Paul Thomas Anderson is famous for profound, long and versatile movies, I have to admit that Inherent Vice included too much of those features: almost 2,5 hours, complicated and hectic plot, inconsistent mood, bunch of irrelevant characters, etc. made it rather difficult to follow at times (and later, I had to refer to Internet materials for filling gaps).True, the selection of performers is great as usual, but many characters remained static and/or provided no additional value to the movie; in my opinion, the best were Joaquin Phoenix as Larry ""Doc"" Sportello and Josh Brolin as Det. Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen, whose activities - both apart and jointly - was pleasant to follow. The other assets worth mentioning are choice of costumes and music, letting the hippie atmosphere into the spotlight.In general, it seems to me that Inherent Vice could be a result of Anderson, Christopher Nolan and Terrence Malik getting together and smoking pot... :) I had my giggling moments and I liked the era depiction, but the framework could have enough for a 100-minute-movie.",Inherent Vice
37,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,29 September 2020,"I kind of feel that Anderson lends himself to a film like this. He uses a lot of extreme wide angles and if you ever smoked a little dope in college the world looks a little like when you mount that 18mm on your SLR. His choice of lenses lends itself to telling the story of a guy like Doc without going over the top ala Fear and Loathing and making it a little too blatantly FX.The humor works in best possible dry as a martini kind of way, and it's played straight like comedy should be.But really, the premise sold me. Take a hard boiled film noir kind of mystery and replace Sam Spade with the perpetual stoner and then watch him try to solve a mystery.It's incoherent enough to make you believe that Doc is just a little too rocked to function properly most of the time, which is reflected in his effectiveness and decision making skills. He's smart enough to not bumble his way through it, but has gotten off the magic school bus enough to do his best possible work.And it makes the film do that one singular thing that all movies are required to do in order to be called a success... it entertains.And honestly it's a delight to watch. The acting was great, the director was the best possible person to take on the adaptation, and the lighting walked that fine line between naturalistic and cinematic.I'd call it a beautiful film, but it's hard to call a movie about drugs beautiful without sounding utterly pretentious... so, I'll settle with the highest praise a movie can get... it's entertaining and a pleasure to watch.",Inherent Vice
38,PWNYCNY,A spoofy movie.,9,10 January 2015,"What is this movie about? A simple question yet one that defies an answer, for to answer this question means that this movie has a plot, something that is not the case. In an avant-garde way, this movie is refreshing. Instead of trying to actually tell a story, the production staff dispenses with a plot and relies on the skill of the cast to entertain the audience, and to an extent, this unique approach works. Jaoquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and Josh Brolin are entertaining. Of the three, Brolin's performance is the most comical. He plays a caricature of a hard-boiled city homicide/robbery detective. The movie's main problem is that these quality performances are not matched by an equally coherent story. Just because the main character is a pot smoking substance abuser doesn't mean that it should be presumed that the audience is in the same cloudy state of mind. Phoenix demonstrates a talent for slapstick and deadpan comic acting. Marijuana use figures heavily in the story (that is, what is supposed to pass as a story). If this is supposed to send some kind of social message to the audience, i.e., that marijuana use is cool, then this movie will be a favorite and Phoenix your new Hollywood icon. But if all the pot smoking, inane dialog, contrived histrionics, and general silliness becomes too much, remember: the actors are funny, so have yourself a laugh.",Inherent Vice

And I'm not talking about their ambiguous scene together inside a car that closes the movie. I am speaking of the part a little bit earlier that rivals the famous butter-finger episode from LAST TANGO IN PARI$ for grown-up cinema frankness in addressing one of the pillars of American Society, sensual expression. (My biggest quibble with writer\director Paul Thomas Anderson's film is that he chose this fairly inconsequential barefoot private eye story for movie adaptation over novelist Thomas Pynchon's much more cinematic Magnus Opus, GRAVITY'S RAINBOW, which depicts the REAL story behind German buzz bomb targeting in WWII London; Phoenix would be great as RAINBOW's lead character, Slothrop.)

He has created such cinematic gems as ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"", and ""There Will Be Blood"". His films are extremely cerebral, captivating, and powerful. But then came along ""Inherent Vice""! One of the most major disappointments I have witnessed created from a genius auteur. ""Inherent Vice"" is Anderson's latest, and it should be retitled ""Incoherent and Not Nice"". What a disaster!!!! Where is Dirk Diggler, T.J. Mackey, and Daniel Plainview when you need them! ""Inherent Vice"" stars Joaquin Phoenix as a drug-fueled hippie Private Investigator named Larry ""Doc"" Sportello. He gets a surprise visit from sexy ex-girlfriend Shasta who contracts Doc to investigate a scheme by her lover's wife & her lover to frame him; or something like that; who cares? I lost ""Inherent Vice"" interest quickly with this convoluted & dull narrative. The film is set in 1970 in Gordita Beach, California. It's probably called Gordita Beach because of all the stoners there that have the munchies. Anyways- during Doc's investigation, he gets involved with a crazy cast of characters and a wide array of issues from politics, cults, prostitution, the drug trade and dentistry, much of it surrounding the mysterious ""Golden Fang"". But most of the time I was saying ""What's up Doc?"" or more like ""What's up PTA?"" with this unnecessary complex storytelling. Now, I do have to give Anderson a little credit since his movie was adapted from a Thomas Pynchon novel that seemed impossible to adapt to screen; and it's still impossible. If Anderson can't do it, nobody can. Phoenix is solid as Doc, but his weed-loving P.I. act runs its course. Josh Brolin delivered a worthy performance as the hippie-hater Lt. Detective Christian ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen. My favorite performance, which was criminally underutilized in this Vice, was Benecio Del Toro as Doc's lawyer Sauncho Smilax who specializes in marine law. Nevertheless, I utterly despised ""Inherent Vice"" and it is not worthy of a cinematic viewing investigation. * Failure",Inherent Vice

But while the film is full of wonderful camera-work, production design and performances, and there are some very funny scenes, I couldn't quite get my head around the thing. I get that's the point, and that while Thomas Pynchon's novel has the outer form of a detective story, it's not really about plot but about mood and playful mind-games, details and surreal moments. But somehow the lack of tonal focus made it hard for me to get lost in it's rhythms. Feeling like a goofy comedy one minute, a subtle satiric elegy for a hippie age that was never quite as fun as we'd like to remember the next, and a story driven detective noir the next, I found myself not getting engaged in the way I kept wanting to. Given the talents involved, my huge admiration for Anderson, and the generally great critical reaction, I'm open to the idea that I'm missing something. And there are a lot of moments that echo with me, from Josh Brolin's truly gonzo, but yet also somehow understated performance as an uptight, straight-laced cop who is a lot more complex and messed up then he'd like to admit, to the very long single take seduction scene between Joaquin Phoenix and Katherine Waterston that is uncomfortable, sexy, repellent, real, a fantasy and beautifully acted all at the same time. It's certainly a film worth seeing, but for the first time with an Anderson film I felt locked on the outside looking in, feeling a little sheepish and a little dumb.",Inherent Vice

The premise sees a former PI trying to help his ex girlfriend look for her boyfriend. Joaquin phoenix is a really good actor and he is pretty decent in this film. Its just that his character is pretty bland and doesn't really have any character development. Josh brolin is the best character in this film playing the tough cop, I do wish that he had been in the film a little more. The rest of the characters are paper thin and don't really add anything to the film. The story is just ridiculously convoluted and incredibly hard to follow. The script has some incredibly wooden dialogue and for a film marketed as a comedy it wasn't funny at all. The style doesn't add anything either with the pace being incredibly slow and boring, even coming close to sending me to sleep.

43,estebangonzalez10,The first time I was ever disappointed with PTA,4,19 February 2015,"""She came along the alley and up the back steps the way she always used to. Doc hadn't seen her for over a year. Nobody had.""Before I get a lot of hate for disliking this film I just want to say that I have a lot of respect for Paul Thomas Anderson as a director and have rated all of his previous films with at least four out of five stars. Inherent Vice was one of my most anticipated films for 2014 because his recent movies have been mesmerizing. The Master and There Will Be Blood are both films that I absolutely love. Inherent Vice unfortunately didn't work for me and I had a very difficult time keeping up with the movie's plot. I was unfamiliar with Thomas Pynchon's recent novel which this film was adapted from, and perhaps the movie works best for audiences who have read it, but I just couldn't follow what was going on. There are many characters who seem to be mumbling their lines and stoned out of their lives, so at times it was hard to figure out whether we were seeing actual events or simple hallucinations. I also had difficulty understanding a lot of the dialogue and found the pacing extremely slow. I put a lot of effort into trying to understand the plot of the film, but I simply didn't get it. The comedy didn't work for me either and at times I felt like I was missing a lot of the jokes everyone else seemed to enjoy. It was one of the rare films that I thought I wasn't going to be able to finish, because I felt tempted to walk out of the movie. I kept with it out of the respect I have for Anderson's work, but in all honesty I wasn't able to engage with the characters.There are some great performances in Inherent Vice. Joaquin Phoenix is impressive and delivers a solid and believable role as Doc Sportello, a private eye who is constantly getting high. Josh Brolin also delivers as Bigfoot, the tough detective who is always on Doc's back. Katherine Waterston plays this sort of femme fatale who had been Doc's girlfriend in the past and needs his help investigating her current lover (Played by Eric Roberts). I don't want to get into details into the plot because it isn't really important in Inherent Vice. This isn't your conventional detective mystery story. The narration is hard to follow and many characters are introduced in the story with no specific purpose other than to invade Doc's world. Anderson tends to choose projects that center on the end of an era, and in Inherent Vice it revolves around the end of the psychedelic 60's. You get this sense of nostalgia towards that era where the hippies dominated the scene. Anderson does a great job at capturing that period very well and he transports us to this time. It is perhaps the greatest thing about this film along with the strong performances, but the lack of a cohesive narrative and its extremely long running time made it very difficult for me to endure. This is the first Anderson film that I have to admit I didn't enjoy and that I won't be revisiting any time soon. The story is completely absurd and the humor wasn't for me. I kind of feel like I'm the odd one out when everyone else is praising the comedy because I simply never got it. It was a very boring and non engaging experience personally, but I still haven't lost my respect for what Anderson does. I just wasn't interested in these character and wasn't able to follow the story (which I think is purposely done this way). I think The Big Lebowski does a much better job of creating a fun experience for the audience with engaging characters without having an important plot.",Inherent Vice

The film is outright funny. Martin Short is great, and Eric Roberts has actually gotten better looking with age. The screenplay and script are very clever, and even the voiceover wasn't that bad (voiceovers are generally poor devices that are used to convey what is actually going on in the film because the director and/or the writer cannot figure out images that will convey the same idea).

48,TheFearmakers,Neither Here Noir There,1,17 April 2019,"Judging by appearances alone, INHERENT VICE has already been compared to THE BIG LEBOWSKI since our scruffy hippie hero is... well... a scruffy hippie hero, like Jeff Bridges as The Dude. But the real similarity is both channel Film Noir where reluctant underdogs become entangled in an eclectic web of deceit, beautiful women, red herrings and more last names than a phone book...And while LEBOWSKI centered on the product of the 1960's lost in the 1990's, INHERENT VICE takes us to that actual magical place: a colorful era where idealistic L.A. druggies proudly contrast from the straight-laced necktie jerks, who, in this particular case, are all more crooked than Richard Nixon himself (numerously mentioned along with The Manson Family, Paranoia, Blacklisting and a nap-sack of other counter-culture clichés).The problem with VICE isn't the abundance of characters spouting endless monologues within dull interior locations, but our main man, Joaquin Phoenix, whose Larry ""Doc"" Sportello doesn't seem established enough to be taken seriously as an investigator of any sort, or a doctor or... Whatever the hell he's supposed to be just isn't clear.Phoenix sleepwalks through the role without humor, pathos or legitimate world-weary dynamic while his given-task weaves in so many twists and turns, there's no palpable destination. Being misled through a foggy treadmill maze is the staple of any gumshoe flick, but a light at the end of the tunnel, or a few sparks along the way, keeps the viewer intrigued, enlightened, and awake. Meanwhile, epic art house director Paul Thomas Anderson seems even more absent than his otherwise talented MASTER star.The best character is Josh Brolin's square-jawed flattop bully cop Bigfoot, who represents everything hippies thoroughly detest: Ironically enough, he has one thing the entire movie lacks, which can be summed up in three words: An...

49,davidmvining,Much funnier than I thought it would be,7,25 November 2019,"I was not really expecting how funny this movie was. I remembered the trailer, especially the shot where Joaquin Phoenix gets shouldered so hard by a cop that he flies nearly off screen, but it ended up being funnier the way it was presented in the movie.From the very first lines of dialogue, Doc, our hero, is in way over his head. His former hippie ex-girlfriend shows up and asks him to investigate a real estate mogul, his wife, and a plot to have him committed to a loony bin. It's obvious from that start, that Doc is never going to catch up with the plot in any meaningful way.What's interesting is that Doc spends almost the entire movie following a trail of breadcrumbs without ever actually doing anything himself or witnessing anything. It's a noir where the ""hero"" always shows up too late and everyone around him does everything just to fill him in on it later. Considering the level of drug use in the film, that seems to be a deliberate choice. Doc cannot catch up because he has trouble deciphering reality from his own drug-fueled haze. There are moments that seem to suggest that Doc talks to people who aren't there.After two hours, we finally get what could be called a character action, and it almost ends up feeling incidental. Doc shows up at the office of a guy who's constantly almost in and then out of prison (being some kind of enforcer and police informant at the same time). Doc knows he needs to be there because he's there, but when he gets asked why he's there he can't explain it. It's only when the big Aryan Brother with the swastika tattooed on his face walks into the room that a wave of realization comes over him about why he might be there, and by then it's too late. We've seen this guy here and there, always on his tail having some connection to the disappearance to the real estate mogul and the murder that Doc gets framed for (poorly) at the beginning of the film.Falling in with the idea that everyone knows what's going on except Doc, the Aryan ties up Doc with the implicit threat of torture and death. This kicks Doc out of his laconic mood to the point where he actually fights back. It's not in service to the plot that Doc suddenly becomes a player, it's in the service of his own survival.Throughout the film, Doc has several interactions with Bigfoot, a police detective who's trying to follow some of the same leads as Doc. The two are mirror images of each other. Doc the rudderless hippie versus Bigfoot the crewcut cop. They cross paths, exchange information, and steadily grow more similar as Doc grows a bit from the situation and Bigfoot gets further and further humiliated, falling further and further behind in the plot as they go. Because the plot of the film actually doesn't matter though, Bigfoot is putting great importance on something that doesn't matter leading him to busting down Doc's door and eating a pile of Doc's weed.I think that this is a movie that will grow with me over time. I had a good idea of what I was getting into going in. I knew that there was little to no action, that it was long, and that it was drug-fueled. That mostly prepared me for the film, but the miasma on top kept my focus a bit more than the underlying ideas, and I think more viewings will get me to appreciate those more. As it stands, though, I was able to laugh consistently through the film.A note on that, to bring this all together from the beginning. That shot of Doc flying from the shoulder by the cop in the trailer is played straight there. Normal sound effects and dialogue. In the film, the sound has dropped off and we hear the laconic female voice over waxing a certain poetic tone about Doc's situation and mindset. As we hear that, we watch the tone shatter with the shoulder, but the voice over makes no mention of what happened on screen and simply continue. It's a really funny juxtaposition of sound and sight, the sort of humor that pervades the film.",Inherent Vice

51,Seraphion,The case grew cold very early on,5,25 January 2015,"The movie delivers a slow but nice opening, introducing characters and the world setting that looked very interesting. But sadly the movie overstayed this advantage by not giving something new to be amazed upon within its next few minutes. Yes the case investigation moves fluidly without any significant hindrance, but that's just it. The case moves so very surely like it's on a certain schedule or something. The story may portray the case leads to a dead end, but there, a few seconds later somebody out of the blue comes to Doc and brings something that's just what he really needed. This makes the movie somehow predictable, and thus it became boring very early on. Especially for a movie two-hour long like this, that's a major issue. Joaquin Phoenix's acting here is surely isn't his best, which is quite funny to think about. How an actor could acts bad when he acts as a stoned and doped hippie? Josh Brolin doing another macho-man character is something that makes this movie boring because we kind of got tired seeing his Gangster Squad role even just in supporting capacity.",Inherent Vice
52,brando647,"Yes, I Loved INHERENT VICE (Both the Film and the Novel)",8,8 January 2016,"The number one problem people have with Paul Thomas Anderson's INHERENT VICE is that it's overwhelmingly complicated. It all begins simply enough. A stoned-out private investigator in 1970 Los Angeles receives a surprise visit from an ex-girlfriend who needs his help. Her new lover is a wealthy land developer whose wife is scheming to have him committed to a nut house. But why? And can it be prevented? That's the nugget at the core that gets the snowball rolling downhill and it's not long before it starts to grow more and more complex. Murder. Missing persons. Resurrection. What is the Golden Fang? A boat? A smuggling ring? A consortium of dentists? What interest do the Feds have in all this? If you're not giving this film your full attention (and, really, even if you are), chances are good you'll walk away with more questions than answers when the film ends. It can be frustrating for some. My initial confusion only made me more curious and I've since gone on to read the novel from Thomas Pynchon on which the movie is based. And I still don't have all the answers. But I get it now, as much as anyone can ""get"" INHERENT VICE. I'll try and keep my comments skewed toward the movie, but it all sort of runs together in my head now. Regardless, consider me a fan of Anderson's film and this a glowing recommendation that anyone with the patience check it out. Had it not been released in 2014a year that also saw releases for BIRDMAN and NIGHTCRAWLER and a score of other surprisingly good filmsthis would've easily taken the top spot as my favorite of the year.It's hard to discuss INHERENT VICE without going into too much detail or dragging the novel into it. The novel seemed to document the end of an era where the hippie generation was coming to an end, and the movie sort of touches on it (especially in the interactions between our hero Doc and the authorities) but it doesn't come through much. At face value, INHERENT VICE is a psychedelic film noir: the main character, Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), is a private investigator approached by a damsel in distress and becomes drawn into a conspiracy bigger than he can begin to comprehend. Voice-over narration from Doc's friend Sortilège (Joanna Newsom) is utilized to keep the audience informed and help set the film's tone, pulling from Pynchon's own colorful writing. I was a big fan of Anderson's previous film The MASTER, where the plot was secondary to the characters themselves. With that thought in mind, I see a lot of the same in INHERENT VICE. The plot of the novel is far too complex and winding to fit into a two hour movie and Anderson has skillfully utilized the most important bits to craft a semi-coherent noir film where our focus shouldn't necessarily be about following the case (though, if you can, it's a fun head-scratcher) but following the characters caught up in it.At the center of everything is Doc Sportello, the coolest burnout since the Coens introduced us to the Dude in '98. He's perpetually stoned as he meanders from clue to clue in his search for missing millionaire Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts) and, more importantly, Sportello's ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston). I love that Sportello knows he's stumbled onto something huge but he can't seem to piece it all together. This case has blown up way bigger than anything he's accustomed to dealing with in his lazy, marijuana haze but he's got an obligation to see it through, especially when the police seem near worthless. His contact in the LAPD is Detective ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), a lone wolf cop with aspirations for big screen stardom and a bottomless well of distaste for filthy hippies. Bigfoot has his own interests in the case and forms a shaky collaboration with Doc, feeding each other information as they uncover more and more bizarre connections. Bigfoot and Doc are two sides of the same coin and there becomes a begrudging respect apparent between the two. The rest of the world is populated with shady characters and a stellar supporting cast including Martin Short, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, and Benicio Del Toro. For what it's worth, I eagerly recommend INHERENT VICE to others and, if it manages to spark your interest, follow it with a reading of Pynchon's novel. I absolutely loved Pynchon's writing and you'll discover just how true Anderson was to the source material. Suggesting a book as well as a movie sounds as if I'm assigning homework (more so because both can be annoying complicated to the wrong people), but it's worth it.",Inherent Vice
53,begob,So close,8,3 February 2015,"Hard to tell if this is a classic.First up, I laughed a lot. Great variety in the humour. My favourite line: ""Doctor, I think there's a problem with the couch in your office. And bring that bottle."" Second, I've read The Big Sleep many times, been bamboozled by the plot, amused by the fact the author admitted he couldn't explain it. A real pleasure to see so many of the same elements here. Haven't read Pynchon's novel, but looks like he mashed up a few Chandler works.This is real noir, where apparently casual connections draw you deep into human corruption. Takes a while to enjoy the PI stoner hero, but his ability to see through the details with his blown mind is heart warming. Great performance by the actor. Bigfoot is excellent too.Also sharp satire of the American way and its sh'tty heroes - cops & capitalists - with plenty of p-taking humour, sometimes absurd.One problem is lots of interesting actresses, but no single great part, and none of them spitting acid or betraying their men.Biggest problem is the gentle ending. All the convoluted plotting should be blown away by a cosmic reveal on men & women, life & death. Maybe this takes noir to a new level, but I didn't catch the elevator. Or maybe the choice of optimism over pessimism is determined by our troubled times. There are a thousand moving parts in this film, so will watch again.I heard an interview with the director: he mined the novel for dialogue (it is great dialogue) and thought of the story like a Neil Young song - regret for what was ruined but hope for the future.Maybe this film is a ten.

54,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Dense, indecipherable, whimsical, but melancholic.",8,26 January 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson has gone from a perfectionist to an imperfectionist. Now he encourages incoherence and spontaneity above controlling every detail for a hyper reality and instead wants to stay closer to a documentary aesthetic. In fact, I'd argue that he's never been more Robert Altman-esque than with Inherent Vice. This is wacky, whimsical and bizarre, but ultimately deeply sad. The plot is dense, near indecipherable and hard to follow. Threads get solved without much celebration and they just lead to a bigger mess of problems. It's still enjoyable thanks to the sleek and smoky atmosphere in the production with the blend of a funkadelic soundtrack and Joanna Newsom's sultry narration. It's easy to sink into even if it isn't your scene. But it's not about sex, drugs and cults. Set in California in 1970, the time and place of Paul Thomas Anderson's birth, it's probably one of his most personal films. It evokes its era with a deep longing for it despite the pain, confusion and chaos, much as Doc longs for his ex- girlfriend.I assumed Inherent Vice meant that there's always a dark side, but the film explains it that means nothing in this world lasts. Subsequently it becomes irrevocably melancholic despite the humour of the film. The cinematography feeds into this idea as well being shot on grainy film in a way that is arguably dying. Anderson utilises it for the best effect, but its appeal is limited, as he strips down the mise en scene and often puts actors against white walls as if it's a dress rehearsal. Unfortunately Joaquin Phoenix is a disappointment, having impressed greatly in his comeback with The Master and Her. Perhaps he's run out of juice. He tries too hard to balance light and dark and his character isn't believable enough to hold the weight of the film. However, the supporting cast is excellent, especially Josh Brolin and Joanna Newsom even if tracking their character's inner conflicts is a struggle. Inherent Vice is an intentional mess, but one with great ideas at its core if not ones that are articulated as eloquently as Anderson's previous films. A masterpiece roll can't last forever, ironically.8/10",Inherent Vice
55,Screen_Blitz,"Inherent Vice is a bizarrely entertaining stoner epic destined to amuse and captivate some, while deeply frustrate others with its complexity",7,13 June 2017,"Paul Thomas Anderson has an endowment for freshly provocative storytelling, a gift he has demonstrated in the past with such endeavors as 'Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia', 'There Will Be Blood', and 'The Master' to name some. It is only little wonder why he was one of the few filmmakers compatible for this irreverent hipster-themed comedy inspired by the novel by Thomas Pynchon. Inherent Vice is a decidedly loopy stoner comedy that straps you on a roller coaster through the eccentric Los Angeles counterculture during the psychedelic 60s and 70s when sex, drugs, and rock n' roll exploded into society like wildfire. At the core of this provocative ride is a darkly humorous murder plot that spirals into a devilishly complex fable with the firepower to either entertain viewers with its a heavy haul of idiosyncratic characters and style, or frustrate them its seemingly nonsensical narrative. Set in 1970, this film centers on Doc Spatello (played by Joaquin Phoenix), an absent-minded, pot- loving Los Angeles investigator who's approached by this ex- girlfriend Shasta (played by Katherine Waterston) about her current boyfriend (played by Eric Roberts) and his former lover being a target for a kidnapping. Upon going on an investigation, and a white supremacist suspect (played by Christopher Allen Nelson) is murdered and Doc is informed by Detective Bigfoot (played by Josh Brolin) of Shasta's disappearance. Pursuing after the criminals responsible, Doc is unexpectedly placed on a collision course against a string of mysterious figures including a suspicious musician (played by Owen Wilson), an undercover police informat Sauncho (played by Benicio Del Toro), a Black guerilla family member (played by Michael Kenneth Williams), and mysterious cult leader; each of whom may or may not have a connection behind the murder.For moviegoers aching for a stylish stoner comedy with darkly funny set pieces and eccentric characters dancing into the mix, this movie certainly delivers. For those pining for a coherent story and a wholesome sense of humor, that is a whole another story. This feverishly offbeat stoner epic is one of those rare cinematic endeavors that is much more easier to engage with when you are not bruising your brain trying to follow the plot. Paul Thomas Anderson, the exhilarating storyteller he is, brings a hefty hand in flooding the story with what appears like a dozen of separate subplots and introducing a number of eccentric supporting characters that feels like a chore to count. This unusual style of writing accounts to an irreverent, but brutally confusing that renders the narrative into a state of ambiguity. Sitting through this tale, it is far from unreasonable for viewers to ask ""what does this character have to do with anything?"" or ""what is the point of this?"". The truth of why this story sets out to be confusing however, is that it intends on matching the lead character's state of drug intoxication, and as a result evokes the same amount of confusion as what the lead character is facing. It is a unique style of storytelling that echoes of works of Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. The prime figure of the story is Joaquin Phoenix's Doc Spatello, a goofy stoner who finds himself colliding with a wide number of colorful characters, each of which deliver some smart social commentary on the counterculture of drug-fueled 60s and 70s including the Cold War, racial politics, and the eccentric social environment of Los Angeles that defined the so-called era. It is an adventure that accounts to an appealing blend of whimsical humor and shocking conspiracies that lead to some unpredictable (and occasionally unpleasant) scenes. Judging his writing in the ensemble cast piece 'Magnolia', it is a unique style that best fits Paul Thomas Anderson's directing methodology, while fueling those bothered by the perplexing plot with frustration and possibly boredom.Returning on screen to Anderson's directorial world is Joaquin Phoenix who made his first collaboration with Anderson in 'The Master', which was perhaps more superior than this endeavor. This time, he grapples on the role of Doc Spatello, and gives an devilishly charismatic performance. It is a role that allows Phoenix is expand upon his acting chops with idiosyncratic humor and substance, while channeling on Jeff Daniels's Mr. Lebowski with his drug-fueled humor and intoxicating dialogue. Phoenix is the one that manages to stand out above the absurdly bloated cast, partially since he acquires the most screen time. Josh Brolin delivers plenty of fortitude as Detective Bigfoot for his time, and his chemistry with Phoenix works like a charm. Katherine Waterston makes a good use of her screen time with her flashy sex appeal, particularly in one scene showing a lingering shot of her in the nude while seductively chatting with Phoenix. Owen Wilson brings some good humor to his role, but falls short of screen time. The remainder of the cast consists of a large number of actors and actresses (Reese Witherspoon, Michael Kenneth Williams, Maya Rudolph, Benicio Del Toro, and Martin Short to name a few) are left stranded in underdeveloped roles that pit them almost nothing to work with, which only comes to show how terrifyingly difficult it is to develop so many characters squeezed into a 148-minute runtime. Inherent Vice is a bizarrely entertaining stoner epic that is destined to leave devout fans of Paul Thomas Anderson's works engaged, while leave others stranded in sheer frustration for his absurdly confusing plot. This is easily one of those cinematic tales that will polarize audiences, and for good reasons. After all, it is not your average part-comedy, part-mystery flick. It is one that opens light on the unique style of Anderson directorial skills, while showing little interest of indulging in coherency.",Inherent Vice
56,punishmentpark,Bummer? Far out?,7,11 September 2015,"'Inherent vice' produces a seemingly endless stream of information about who's who in the post-hippie apocalypse of Southern California in the early '70s. Protagonist Doc Sportello initially goes from place to place, talking to people, gathering information, while narrator Sortilège adds even more to that. There's murder, abduction, disappearance and infiltration all around, but it's pretty hard to keep track. And to watch it a second time just to understand it all, is not the hallmark of a great movie (so I didn't, but I might try it again soon, nonetheless).But 'Inherent...' definitely has a good share of intriguing scenes, Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good and funny as the stoner P.I., and the beauty of Katherine Waterston alone is worth watching this. Josh Brolin's character is an interesting one, culminating in a priceless pot-binge in the end. Eric Roberts, even if rather short, does a terrific performance (in a very funny interaction with Doc). Then I could have sworn I saw Belladonna in there (good job!), but it turned out to be Michelle Sinclair... wink, wink. Martin Short's appearance was also a bit of a surprise. He did a good job, but nothing extraordinary. It would take too long to get into every part or actor / actress, but some characters seemed a little unnecessary in the whole and some actors / actresses were simply not aptly chosen for their parts.'The big Lebowski', 'The long goodbye', 'Chinatown' or other (neo-)film noir detectives certainly come to mind, but this film could have done with some trimming. A lot of chatter is simply not that interesting and the story meanders a little too much here and there. And I'm still not sure how I feel about the sometimes disruptive narration of Sortilège. The bottom line is that 'Inherent...' is simply not as spot on and impressive as it could have been.A good 7 out of 10 for now, but I might give it another go sometime soon.",Inherent Vice

Director Paul Thomas Anderson's dark-comedy is the adaptation of author Thomas Pynchon's 2009 crime-noir novel and a cinematic achievement, fitting in with his other critically lauded films, such as There Will Be Blood, The Master and Boogie Nights.

He gets involved in various situations that are subplots which are apparently related to each other.Many of the characters in this film are stoned on drugs. I wondered if the viewer had to be in the same situation in order to understand this movie. Even after reading the Wikipedia synopsis, I was still confused.A few scenes are interesting and the performances are all fine. But even if this two-and-a-half hour movie were reduced by at least a full hour (which it should have been), it might have had the possibility of throwing out the unnecessary and indulgent ""filler"" and given the (not stoned) viewer a tiny chance of putting the pieces together or maybe to understand why the hell the main character keeps getting himself into really stupid and dangerous situations. For that matter, it was hard to understand why the hell any of the other characters were doing whatever the hell they were doing as well.Maybe, one has to live in Los Angeles to ""get it"". Well, to each their own but this was a terrible disappointment especially considering it was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who has made such fine films before especially ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007).",Inherent Vice
60,brchthethird,"PTA's loosest, but also funniest, film to date",8,27 March 2015,"After a long wait I've finally seen Paul Thomas Anderson's latest cinematic creation, and...it was different, to say the least. It has some loose plotting and a narrative that takes a lot of detours, but the acting, cinematography and music, as well as a keen sense of style make this essential for PTA fans. Other people not so inclined to like indie or art films like this will probably find it slow and boring, though, but it's their loss. The story follows Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, a private eye who is put on a case brought to him by a former girlfriend, and that has to do with the disappearance of her current lover who is some real estate tycoon. But here, the story and plot aren't really the point. What ensues has more to do with capturing the feel of an era, that pivotal moment in US history when the hedonistic culture of the 60's gave way to the more restrained 70's. Doc represents someone who is caught between the two and is somewhat of an outsider, but the perfect lens through the audience can view what transpires on screen. Thematically, there are a lot of elements at play. There's plenty of drugs and paranoia (some of which is brought on by drugs), but also references to the civil rights movement, the Manson family and other things one would think of when defining the 60's (particularly the late 60's). When it comes down to it, this is an odyssey that doesn't require complete understanding to appreciate. Just let the film wash over you like a wave and savor the experience. For now I need to just let it marinate a little longer in order to really develop a coherent opinion about it, but I did enjoy the film nonetheless. I don't completely get everything that happened, although further viewings might clear some of it up. From the technical side of things, INHERENT VICE delivers exactly what you'd expect from a PTA film: stunning visuals, immaculate production design, incredible performances and an eclectic score and soundtrack. Overall, this is loosest but also funniest film that PTA has ever done, and his fans should be pleased.",Inherent Vice

Here, he slams down on our heads a Thomas Pynchon book, and laughs at us for not getting it. It's a delicious assault on filmmaking. It's also a genius, loving tribute to the end of the Hippie revolution of America in the early 1970's. It may never win an Oscar, but it ought to be tried for the Palme D'or at Cannes. Uncompromisingly, I loved it.",Inherent Vice
64,KnightsofNi11,"Expected more, got less",7,8 January 2015,"After such masterpieces like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and There Will Be Blood, it's hard not to expect A LOT from every film coming from the mind of Paul Thomas Anderson. So obviously the standards were pretty damn high going into his newest film Inherent Vice, an adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name about a stoner private investigator who is investigating the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend, as well as a slew of other mysteries and disappearances that coincide with one another amid a cavalcade of characters whose names, careers, and orientations get a little bit tough to keep up with. And by a little bit, I mean there is so damn much going on in this film that keeping up can be a bitch and if you fall behind, well, best of luck to you. I won't say that Inherent Vice is a bad film. I don't know if I could ever say that a film of PTA's was a truly bad film. The dude knows how to direct actors and he is a bonified expert when it comes to the art of visual storytelling. What I got out of Inherent Vice, however, was that it was likely a book Anderson has read countless times and absolutely loves, and he was surely chomping at the bit to do an adaptation. The problem is, you're working with some seriously convoluted subject matter here and it might be possible that Anderson forgot how well he knew the book compared to the millions that would be seeing his film who were in no way familiar with it, myself included. This film feels like it was made for the director before anyone else. That being said, this might be the best possible adaptation for this kind of novel at all. There is a whole lot going on in this flick and the question in the back of my mind was always, ""Where is any of this heading?"" By the end of the film this question was underwhelmingly not answered for me at least. But the one saving grace of Inherent Vice is most definitely the performances, which is where PTA often shines as a director anyways. Joaquin Phoenix is great as always, even though this character can't even compare to the complex troubled souls he played in The Master or Her. Josh Brolin is in peak form as far as entertainment value goes, delivering some of the most absurdly funny moments and lines of the film. We've all seen his ""Moto panakeku (spelling?)"" moment from the trailer, and it does get better than that.Then you've got a whole bunch of great supporting players like Owen Wilson, Benicio del Toro, and Martin Short, as well as a great lineup of strong female performances from Katherine Waterston, Reese Witherspoon, and Jena Malone. Actors seem to be at the top of their game when working with Anderson and this fact is what keeps the confusing and convoluted Inherent Vice at least somewhat entertaining. I'm certainly going to give this film a second chance, and I'll do my best to pay better attention the second time around. Maybe after wading through the onslaught of characters and events and putting things in their right place I'll be able to make some sense of the film and realize its hidden brilliance. For now, though, Inherent Vice certainly does not live up to the caliber of quality I've come to expect from one of my all time favorite directors.",Inherent Vice

68,bryank-04844,"'Inherent Vice' isn't going to be for everyone, due to its chaotic storytelling and long 148 minute run time which goes by a bit slow in the third act.",5,12 August 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best directors working today. His films tell unique and compelling stories with such sustenance and amazing characters that you can't help but be fully immersed within his world. From 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood' to 'Punch Drunk Love' to 'The Master' and everything else in between, Anderson has time and time again show that he is at the top of his game with each film he puts out.This is Anderson's 2nd film in which he's adapted from a book. The first being 'There Will Be Blood' from Upton Sinclair's 'Oil', whereas this one is from Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel 'Inherent Vice'. Set in 1970, I was hoping this would be an offshoot of 'Boogie Nights', but that's far cry from 'Lot 49', if you catch my drift. 'Inherent Vice' plays out like a kooky noir film with a 'Dude Lebowski' type of character weaving in and out of a vast array of whacky characters including hookers, hippies, corrupt police, nazi bikers, new age cults, black power gangs, politicians, pedophile dentists, and wealthy real estate moguls, while all set in 197- Los Angeles under a thick cloud of marijuana smoke.Our main tour guide through this asylum of oddball characters is Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), a private dick who spends most of us time under the influence of a joint, but for some reason he can navigate the straight and narrow from freaks to the top of the social ladder quite easily. Doc is at his beachfront house when a beautiful girl he used to be involved with named Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterson), shows up to ask for help in finding her secret love sex partner Mickey Wolfmann, a wealthy real-estate mogul.Much like these fun noir films, there is usually a narrator who helps us along the story. In this case, you might assume it would be Doc, but instead it's a female voice, whom we don't know the identity, even in the end. With Wolfmann disappearing, this sends Doc into a whirlwind of characters to deal with including the FBI and local police. One of these detective cops is Bigfoot Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), who is a big straight laced man with a buzz cut who looks like he just stepped out of a 70s police show. In fact he does extra work on 'Adam-12'. Since Doc is a freak himself, the FBI and local police task him to look for Wolfmann and another man known as Coy Harlington (Owen Wilson), a former saxophone player thought dead, but appears in the flesh in the most the most unlikely places.Soon enough, Shasta goes missing and everyone starts talking about The Golden Fang, which is some sort of red schooner boat full of drugs and money. But Doc doesn't solve these cases or go at it alone. He has the help from his attorney friend Sauncho Smilex (Benicio Del Toro), who gives him information on people and cases from time to time, and Penny Kimball (Reese Witherspoon), a high end broad with her hair up by day, but lets her hair down at night and gets high with Doc. Through the Nazis, hookers, cultists, crooked politicians, and a drug-fueled dentist with a love of young girls named Dr. Blatnoyd (Martin Short), Doc must keep his cool and journey into the whacky world to find his ex-girlfriends boyfriend.It's an interesting movie to say the least. Instead of having a cohesive story line, Anderson more or less goes scene by scene as if it were its own film, and that can be distracting at times. But what really carries this film are its nutso characters and their interactions with each other. The best one being James Brolin's Bigfoot Bjornsen. He's might just be one of the funniest and best characters in a long time. One on hand, he's rude, gruff, violent, and self aware, where in an instant he can be seen sucking on a frozen chocolate banana in a very provocative way. And that just scratches the surface with him. The rest of the cast turn in excellent performances with a spotlight on Katherine Waterson who is unused for most of the film, but shows up towards the end in a powerful yet weird scene that was filmed all in one shot.Joaquin's performance is quite good, but with his Doc character, there needed to be a sillier aspect to him. Joaquin of course is one of the greatest actors in the business, but his comedy, particularly his comedic facial expressions are lacking. Instead he's mostly under the use of drugs and he has a stone like face as he travels around Los Angeles. I just think this character could have benefited from someone from the comedy genre more. And of course, Anderson has a killer soundtrack full of excellent music from the time period as well as perfect score from Jonny Greenwood.'Inherent Vice' isn't going to be for everyone, due to its chaotic storytelling and long 148 minute run time which goes by a bit slow in the third act. But it's amazing and charismatic characters might just keep you around for the long haul. I just don't think you'll be watching this one as much as Anderson's previous films.",Inherent Vice
69,jdkraus,"Not quite what I was expecting, but still pretty good",8,10 January 2015,"Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson and actor Joaquin Phoenix team up again for ""Inherent Vice,"" a somewhat nostalgic look of Los Angeles in the 1970s. Phoenix plays dope-head PI Doc Sportello, who investigates at his ex-lover's request (Katherine Waterson), her boyfriend (Eric Roberts), a married, wealthy man. He quickly learns that he is in more than he bargained for as he encounters a black militant (Michael K Williams), a detective whom he shares a respect/hate relationship with (Josh Brolin), a druggie informant (Owen Wilson), a hedonist dentist (Martin Short), a brothel run by an Asian smuggler group, a cult, and crooked cops. These are only some of the mechanics that Doc discovers. The movie becomes so perplexing and multi-layered that we as viewers become just as dazed as Doc. We merely follow along and try to keep up with the shenanigans and ambiguous subplots. ""Inherent Vice"" is a movie that requires multiple viewings. Even then, it may be questionable for someone to put all the pieces together. I cannot help but wonder if Paul Anderson knew what the film was all about in terms of a plot. However, he is anything but a conventional filmmaker. His past films usually somehow tie together in the end. His latest one though just leaves his viewers scratching their heads, wondering what they had watched for 148 minutes. The only information that sort of guides the audience is the narration by Joanna Newsom. Her character though is a druggie and is only seen by Doc. So, is she a reliable character? Or is she a figment of a drug- induced hippie's imagination? We are not entirely sure. ""Inherent Vice"" is not by any means a bad movie. It is actually quite good. Like all of Anderson's past works, he pushes his actors to give performances to the best of their abilities, and then some. In my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix is a very underrated actor. Like with his role in ""The Master,"" he embodies an unlikeable, yet unique character. The way he carries his gait. The way he remains silent and allows his face to express emptiness and want is remarkable. Brolin holds to the tough guy, hardass, he plays so well. Only this time, he beats up hippies and violently eats chocolate covered bananas on a stick. New faces Joanna Newsom and Katherine Waterson add flare to the roles they are given. Owen Wilson still displays his general awkwardness and goofy humor, too. The nostalgia that is shown really sells to the overall fun of the film. Vintage cars, land-line phones, Adam-12, Richard Nixon, Afros, weed, sex, cult paranoia, and Rock 'n Roll are only some things that people who grew up in the era will recognize and get a smile from. I particularly enjoyed how Roger Elswit's cinematography captures the look of a movie from the 1970s. Shots are underexposed at night and never look lit. In result, there is sort of a natural look that almost makes the movie appear like an older film. ""Inherent Vice"" is not a film for the average viewer. The humor is crude in nature and there is very little action or suspense. For fellow cinema lovers though, you may very well find a fit here. The trailers that try to advertise this movie as a quirky comedy are far from the truth.",Inherent Vice
70,Likes_Ninjas90,On a strictly impressionistic first watch I intensely hated it,4,15 March 2015,"Inherent Vice is Paul Thomas Anderson's most divisive film. On a strictly impressionistic first watch I intensely hated it. It's slow, overlong at two and a half hours and incomprehensible. Is there much value in talking about a film like this, deliberately convoluted, after a single viewing? It would be difficult to rewatch the film though given its overlength and obtuseness. A more valuable question to ask is how much we should value a film solely for being different. Typifying the way the film and its apparent uniqueness has divided people is in some of the critical scores. On Rotten Tomatoes it's Anderson's lowest rated film at 72% ""Fresh"". More specifically, it is polarising some of the top critics. Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian rated the film five stars and commented on its ""sheer, exhilarating differentness"". Films which are genuinely unique or different can seem like an excitable pipe dream given how homogenised cinema is by the studios but it's still largely a matter of execution.Kyle Smith from the New York Post called the film a ""two-and-a-half-hour endurance test"" and rated the film one and a half stars out of four. He made an interesting comment about Anderson's strength being that he loathes clichés, but also structure and having a point. I had similar impressions of Anderson's previous film The Master, which had fine performances but offered no transparency about its meaning. Like Smith, I suspect Anderson's longing to be different, something he's pursued throughout all the film's he's made, is now working in overdrive. Some unfairly accused There Will Be Blood of imitating Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Since then, Anderson has lost his thematic clarity and the classic narrative line Blood so beautifully conveyed, opting to be self-consciously different and weird as his defining auteurist imprint. It's like a deliberate rebuttal to his critics.Adapted from a noir crime novel by Thomas Pynchon, Inherent Vice is set in the 1970s and features a stoner private detective played by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix and Anderson formed a strong partnership with The Master and this time under a big hat, sunglasses and out of control mutton chops he gives us another reliably slurred, rambling comic performance. One of the major problems with the film though isn't the lead actor but the amount of dialogue and exposition. At one point Anderson supposedly wrote the script using the 300 page novel sentence for sentence. The movie feels like it's almost entirely dialogue driven, through long, dense conversations. In these scenes of talking heads the camera rarely moves and sometimes it doesn't even cut away but holds the shots for an eternity. The pacing of this film is utterly leaden and there aren't that many memorable images except for a rare exterior sequence in a downpour where the camera fluidly paces after Phoenix down the street. A film this crazy and manic could have used far more energy and spirit.Sketched around the static, insulated cinematic form of these conversations is an increasingly jumbled, boring narrative, with the only defense of its untidiness being ""the noir genre is always like that"". Its overcrowded with biblical references, historical phases and oddballs including but not limited to dentists, hippies, aggressive cops, Nazis and cultists (some of these weirdos are played by Josh Brolin, Benecio Del Toro, Owen Wilson and Reese Witherspoon in a small part). In spite of the divisive opinions about the film most agree this isn't incoherent, although some are offering more leeway to the film's sense of humour. But there are funnier, wittier film noirs than this one. The Big Sleep, which many have referenced as a companion, is full of dry wit and so too are convoluted mysteries like Kiss, Kiss Bang Bang and The Big Lebowski, which are also more fun. Nor are these films self-indulgent enough to stick around for two and a half hours. At this length I want more than quirkiness, the odd laugh and a cool soundtrack. A solid story isn't too much to ask from someone as talented as Anderson. He has the potential to be one of the great contemporary filmmakers but can he give us a few more clues and one less red herring?",Inherent Vice
71,ThurstonHunger,Collide-a-scope noir,6,17 January 2016,"Psychedelic noir? A pretty trippy mess, that likely comes from loving the book (which I've not read yet) so much that PTA couldn't cast aside many of the characters. Just a guess.Joaquin Phoenix finds the right tone for the leading P.I. but certainly needs the balance of Josh Brolin's Bigfoot to give the movie something at its heart. Sorry but reuniting the hapless Coy boy with his family (nice that the heroin baby cleaned up so pretty, and yeah she was call Amethyst.) Or the love of Sportello for Shasta, those just fizzled for me. The most fascinating couple was Phoenix and Brolin by far.By the way, if you just read the names of many of the characters that will give you a feeling for the weightlessness of the film. But while you do that, check out the cast, as I think many who stumble across this on a Friday night will repeat to themselves, ""Oh s/he's in this too"" multiple times. That Friday night stumble may also help the drug humor go down a little smoother.I suspect the actors in the film had more fun than most audiences will, but i could appreciate their mugging it up for fun.Storywise, I feel like if Sportello were actually the *father* of Shasta, that might have tied in an interesting dad/daughter thread for a movie that was often threadbare. The crime plot and loose social collisions were tabloid derived, and the depiction of women was often more threadbare than the plot. The strongest woman, and the funniest scene for me, came from Mrs. Bigfoot, who we don't really see completely on screen, intercepting a phone call between the two male leads.While I don't remember any Dark Prince in Palos Verdes in the 70's this film had a vague memory aroma from around there of chatting to our neighbor's boyfriend (probably 17 to my 13) while he was stoned on the steps of our neighbor's walk-up. Mildly amusing, but not the best use of my time.",Inherent Vice

It's almost like the director tried to do this movie 'Tarantino style' yet he failed miserably. 95% of the time you don't know what's going on, and the other 5% you're trying to not fall asleep, because everybody in this movie talks SO DAMN SLOW! At the end, there's SO many things left unexplained... like I'm sitting here, wondering what happened to at least 4 different characters... what happened to them in the end? Why don't we get some kind of a resolution for those characters? It's just a massive mystery, that YOU YOURSELF have to be a P.I. to investigate it seems.",Inherent Vice

It is a giant departure for PTA...but still feels pretty PTA-ish. There's a willingness to let the humor and ridiculousness sit for a moment. Usually he's giving dramatic scenes the space to breathe, giving the tension time to escalate. In this case, he's letting the silliness set in. The lingering shots of Doc's ""notes"" was one of the funniest bits I have seen in a long time. Still, the plot's a little messy and slow to reveal itself.

74,Rickting,This movie is brilliant,9,4 January 2016,"This is a great movie. It's been given little attention, it didn't make back its budget at the box office and many have trashed it as confusing and self indulgent. OK, so it is very confusing but I've never enjoyed being confused more. Inherent Vice is outstanding and I stand firmly and proudly by that statement. A hippie detective investigates the disappearance of a former girlfriend. It gets unbelievably complicated since there's so much more to it. Hilarious, tragic and utterly fascinating, Inherent Vice pulls viewers right into a twisted, psychedelic world where nothing makes sense, there's a lot of sadness and everything is out of order. The way it does this, using it's wonderfully quirky characters, endlessly effective humour and emotion and a gleefully bonkers plot, is hugely impressive. What's even more impressive is that at the end of the film you don't want to leave. Personally I couldn't quite figure out what Inherent Vice was focussing on thematically, although I had my ideas. Whatever this movie is truly about, it moved me a lot.It's a confusing and indulgent movie. You won't always follow the plot. The best approach is let the movie wash over you and absorb you. The acting, especially from Josh Brolin who sends memories of the ill judged Oldboy remake into the back of your mind in a brilliant supporting performance playing a bad temped LAPD officer, is excellent. The script is hilarious, touching and always keeps you guessing. The direction from Paul Thomas Anderson mixes art with substance beautifully and this movie is literally entertaining from beginning to end. It's a bit too long at 2 and a half hours and admittedly some moments could have been cut, but I'm not complaining. If you approach this movie in the right way you're in for a treat. It's a weird and wonderful film where not a lot makes sense but that's part of the fun. The best way to describe Inherent Vice would be riding a roller coaster through a kaleidoscope. It's mad, it's confusing, it's indulgent and it's absolutely brilliant.9/10",Inherent Vice
75,dragokin,Thomas Pynchon goes mainstream,2,5 July 2015,"Not sure why the hate against against Inherent Vise, since it is another typical Paul Thomas Anderson movie: Well crafted, too long and very pretentious.Since it was based on a novel by Thomas Pynchon, you know you're in for a ride. And if you've read anything by Mr. Pynchon, you'd know that mentioning his name would cast a glow in the eyes of those in the know. This seems to be his more accessible work or merely an attempt to enter the mainstream.Labeling Inherent Vice as comedy crime drama is an understatement if you omit the word stoner in this description. Anyhow, i guess the point was that there was no point, but i don't need more than two hours of screen time, numerous plot lines and weird moments to get me there. Occasional jokes lead this movie to it's second star.",Inherent Vice

Everything from the lighting to the editing to the gags are excellently crafted in ""Inherent Vice"" and the talented cast showing off why they are as good as they are is the icing on the cake on this entertaining film. The only downside I had with the film is the fact the story and plot are just overflowing. The film is very complex and convoluted and it often made the film a little confusing and hard to follow. It wasn't one of those cases where the movie is too hard to understand but it was one of those films where the dialogue and plot are so intricate that you had to pay 100% attention to it and you couldn't really find the time to enjoy the other aspects of the feature—like the acting and comedy—because if you weren't paying attention or did something like blink or sneeze during one of the many exposition-heavy dialogue sequences, you ran the risk of missing a lot. However, this aside, the film is still pretty amazing.",Inherent Vice
77,ClaytonDavis,Paul Thomas Anderson has created an odd monster with a stunning ensemble and surreal standouts...,7,4 October 2014,"Let's start this off with a reward offering. I'll pay anyone $20 if they can explain to me, in detail, the full plot and synopsis of ""Inherent Vice,"" front to back. That's a good place to start, eh?The New York Film Festival press and audiences given the gift of a first look at Paul Thomas Anderson's hotly anticipated ""Inherent Vice"" starring Joaquin Phoenix and an all-star cast. Based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon, rumors flew about for months that the novel is a tough read and that the translation from book to film could be confusing in the hands of an auteur filmmaker like Anderson. Well, to a certain extent, they are absolutely correct. ""Inherent Vice"" is such a mind trip, one that will probably make you want to enroll in drug rehab by the end credits. What's amazing about it is even though you, nor I will probably ""get it,"" and there's way more questions than answers at the moment, I cannot wait to revisit it again to start seeking those things out. You can see a little of Anderson's entire filmography.Our ""basic synopsis"" is the story of Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, who in the 1970's, begins to search for his missing former girlfriend. The other things that accompany those facts, is a hallucination of laughs, satire, and magnificent filmmaking abilities.Let's start with thanking the good Lord for Paul Thomas Anderson and his love of 35mm. Even though the screening did not show the film in that quality (the public screening however did), there's a charm that's still embedded within all of Anderson's film that pays homage to all the classic films of history. This is also partly thanks to Academy Award winning DP Robert Elswit, who can frame a scene to tension and success. Much like his past efforts such as ""The Master,"" ""There Will Be Blood,"" and ""Boogie Nights,"" there's a magnitude of a visual master's exercises on display. He crafts provocative and engaging players that fully mesmerize you for its duration. On the top of his game, once again is the genius that is Joaquin Phoenix. He's hilarious, and nothing like ""The Dude"" as many will compare him. He's a three-dimensional character with layers, fully invested in the story, and best of all, utterly believable. In a quirky, detective mystery such as this, you expect some outrageous behavior that can sometimes run false. Call me crazy, I believed nearly all. Phoenix is pure, ludicrous, and keeps you fixated entirely. You couldn't ask for a more dependable thespian at this time in cinema. There's even a weird but obvious comparison to Freddie Quell, as if Freddie's illegitimate child got into drugs and missed out on the alcoholism.The supporting players are as rich as any Anderson creation before. Finally back to large ensembles, where he has shined time and time again in films like ""Magnolia,"" he assembles one of the strongest casts seen in 2014. Like a rock and roll star, Josh Brolin owns the stage with a savage and vicious dedication to his character, he stands out as one of the finest performances of the year. I adored him, and it might be his finest outing yet, and something that could ring him some much deserved awards attention. If you don't know her name yet, Katherine Waterston will be on the tongues of many for years to come. As Shasta Fay Hepworth, you'll find an enigmatic character with an entrancing and sensual aura. At times, feeling like a mixture of Rollergirl from ""Boogie Nights"" and Claudia Wilson Gator from ""Magnolia,"" Waterston is one of engrossing and compelling characters of the year. It's an awards worthy performance, baring the soul of a performer that understands her purpose, Waterston is plain magnificent. You will get big chuckles from Benicio del Toro, Owen Wilson, and Martin Short, all of which make their mark. In one strong scene, Jena Malone leaves her mark while Michael Kenneth Williams could have set the screen on fire with more time than what he was given. Sasha Pieterse (fabulous as always), Reese Witherspoon (reminding us why we loved Johnny and June Cash together so much), Eric Roberts (yearning for a larger role at this time in his career), Joanna Newsom (our new female Morgan Freeman of this generation's narrators), and Maya Rudolph (who needs to team up with hubby more often), all shine.Why the world isn't recognizing Jonny Greenwood as one of the most innovative and talented composers yet is beyond me. Once again, everything on-screen is elevated by his eerie composition and whimsical take on the 70's aura. Not to mention, the soundtrack may be THE album of the year. You can't tell me that you won't have that on repeat seconds after viewing. You also get a richly realized costume design by Mark Bridges and honest sets by David Crank and Amy Wells. It's a technical masterpiece for sure.""Inherent Vice"" is such a strange demon. Hard to say you love, if you don't comprehend it all yet, but with enough magic to keep coming back for more. It's one of the best offbeat and pecuilar monsters seen on screen this year, and you just might fall for its potent nature.",Inherent Vice

It's the tail end of the psychedelic '60s and paranoia is running the day and Doc knows that ""love"" is another of those words going around at the moment, like ""trip"" or ""groovy,"" that's being way too overused - except this one usually leads to trouble. With a cast of characters that includes surfers, hustlers, dopers and rockers, a murderous loan shark, LAPD Detectives, a tenor sax player working undercover, and a mysterious entity known as the Golden Fang, which may only be a tax dodge set up by some dentists... Part surf noir, part psychedelic romp.With Paul Thomas Anderson films that I've seen so far like: Boogie Nights, There will be Blood, The Master and Magnolia. I haven't seen he's other films yet, but the films that I have seen from him I can say that Paul Thomas Anderson is a fantastic film maker that always have these beautiful shots in his movies that always stick with me after the movie is over... so what happened here?. This isn't at all a bad movie, I mean I am giving it a 2 and a half out of 4 stars for god sake. I also give The Master the same rating but that film is slowly started to grow on me, but Inherent Vice just left me standing with nothing really knocking me off my feet with anything brilliant or anything like that.Joaquin Phoenix in this movie feels like his right at home when it comes to films like this, and once again he just knocks it out of the park in this movie. Phoenix can do a Oscar worthy performance in his sleep that how good of a actor he is and in this he dose he's usual stuff of awesomeness. I already went on about his performance for the past two years now and wow I haven't even reviewed a movie and never said ""Phoenix was the worse part of that film"", it's always the good stuff I always bring up, so yeah Joaquin Phoenix dose a excellent and believable performance has Sportello (Or the little Hippie that he always been called in this movie).The other actors in the movie: Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon and Benicio Del Toro all do a fantastic job in they roles, and the other actors that I didn't name do good to. Heck nobody didn't do a god awful performance in this movie, it's all good. The directing from Paul Thomas Anderson I would compare it like The Master in some way has those two films have the same looking shots and Phoenix acting crazy like he did in that other film. Anderson directed this movie pretty good, but I don't know if it's him or not but I think these a lot of scenes that drag like hell and the movie felt kind of messy at parts. It may sound like a complain and well I'm kind of am, but besides all that he directed the movie pretty good of what he had.Now for the problems: Has I said before the movie felt kind of messy at parts and I don't know if it's just me or it's really hard to follow the movie, because it goes by so slow and so quick as well that I didn't know what was going on at times. The movie can be really and I do mean really boring, and that's just a real shame because I tried and tried to like this movie and tried to enjoy it, but I won't lie the movie really did bored me, and this is coming from a guy who wanted this to be fantastic.Inherent Vice has to be my least favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film yet.

82,peefyn,"I can sense the depth, but it's foggy",7,8 March 2015,"I have read the book, and cannot distance myself from that in this review.The book could have been adapted into a thriller/comedy. The screenwriter could have chosen to focus on the scheme(s) in the book - which actually contains quite a bit of action - and turned it into a funny movie that would give you the ""ah!"" moment in the end as all the intricate details are explained.That's not what Paul Thomas Anderson wanted with this movie. The movie does simplify the plot of the book by removing some characters and reducing the importance of many of them. This is practical and necessary, and is not done to dumb down the story. What the movies does not do is make any effort to explain what is going on. By removing characters and scenes, the movie makes it even harder to follow the plot than the book. Why? Because Anderson is not interested in relating a series of events. He wants to show us something more, and after having just seen it once: I am not quite sure what. But I'm sure it's there.Even not seeing what Anderson wanted with this movie, and if you look past the joy of seeing the characters you know from a book come to life: This movie has some great scenes.

85,kgprophet,Half-Baked David Lynch meets Big Lebowski,5,9 July 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson did incredible work on ""There will Be Blood"", cementing himself in the realm of Terrance Malick or Nicolas Refn, or other gifted directors who show moments of brilliance. Anderson's follow-up ""The Master"" also intrigued, and created memorable moments. ""Inherent Vice"" seems more like a minor whim of a film. The writing is loose, with a narrative that pits an average dude against many lively characters. Similar to ""Lebowski', a caper is afoot, for which to ride some humour. When our protagonist Sportello finds himself laying next to a dead body, you can feel the Coen brothers type of exposition.I don't think Anderson wanted to write a Coen brothers movie, and sense that he wanted to channel Robert Altman with pedestrian conversations shot with long lenses that slowly zoom into the talking couple. These scenes eventually create a larger narrative, in the same way David Lynch connected characters via stream of consciousness in ""Lost Highway"" or ""Mulholland Dr."" Bizarre performances by Josh Brolin, Martin Short, and a long list of familiar faces turn this movie into a parade of characters that interact with Sportello. Katherine Waterston does not have nearly enough screen time, since she seems to be the designated leading lady. The film succeeds best when Joaquin Phoenix and Waterston are on the screen together. Hopefully Anderson will utilise Waterston more effectively in a future project.The music defies expectations by trying to play it square, using familiar TV detective music cues. This of course is in contrast with the stream of consciousness narrative, where drug influenced music works better. I felt that using period music of the 70s would blend in best with the overall mood of the piece. Cinematography and production design could have been more showy, but instead backgrounds are kept plain and feature a single prop. So Anderson makes it clear this is a simple production, not to be compared with his well studied and very prominent narratives. The greatest impression this minor outing left on me was that undoubtedly Anderson evaluated the results of this experiment and we will be impressed by what he has learned in future projects.I ultimately found the dialogue not engaging enough (aka dull). The deliberate lack of focus (aka spaced) could still have found a way to engage like was accomplished in ""Big Lebowski"". I think a stronger script where ideas were refined a little better could have made the dialogue more engaging.",Inherent Vice
86,dr_clarke_2,The Anderson film I suspect I will most want to revisit in the future,10,2 February 2021,"After the critical and commercial success of the rather serious The Master, director Paul Thomas Anderson decided to follow it up with a rather more humorous film, in the shape of his 2014 adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice. Set in 1970s Los Angeles, the film - like the novel - follows a stoner private detective as investigates an increasingly broadening case. Partly influenced by film noir and partly - according to Anderson - by Cheech and Chong, the resulting movie is fiendish clever and blisteringly funny at the same time.
Like The Master, Inherent Vice stars Joaquin Phoenix, this time as perpetually stoned private eye Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, who is asked by his ex-girlfriend to help him stop her boyfriend Michael Wolfman's ex-wife and her lover having Wolfman committed to a lunatic asylum. As he follows an increasingly convoluted trail, he encounters a wide variety of eccentric characters, including a devious brothel Madame, a psychotic police detective, and a cult run by dentists turned heroin dealers. In the process, he also encounters physical comedy, slapstick violence, and a whole host of witty lines.
Phoenix, not unusually, is brilliant as Doc, immersing himself in the role so completely that one wonders if he spent the entire shoot stoned. Anderson, as in many of his films, assembles an ensemble cast brimming with familiar faces including Eric Roberts, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon and Martin Short, and they all give pitch-perfect performances in their often small but important roles. Benicio del Toro meanwhile is hilarious as Doc's attorney Sauncho Smilax, capturing something of his performance as Dr. Gonzo back in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, whilst Josh Brolin is terrifyingly convincing as the uptight, Hippy-hating detective ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen.
Anderson wrote the screenplay himself based on Pynchon's novel and did so largely faithfully, although the ending is altered and he turns the character of Sortilège into an unseen narrator (huskily voiced by harpist Joanna Newsom) in order to retain some of Pynchon's prose and to aid the transition from novel to film. Anderson's talent for writing is often overshadowed by his reputation as a director, but the two are fundamentally interconnected: the fact that Anderson writes to his strengths as a director produces a clarity of vision that is undoubtedly a key reason for his success. And so he brings to life his screenplay partly by assembling a handpicked cast, but also ensuring that the mise-en-scéne realises the world he seeks to create, in this case 1970s Los Angeles, the illusion of which is perfectly conjured by the sets and California location filming. As usual in his films, Anderson makes extensive use of highly dynamic camerawork courtesy of his regular cinematographer Robert Elswit and all manner of interesting shots to make the film visually striking - it is immediately recognisable as a P.T. Anderson film due to its distinctive style. The influence of film noir is evident in his use of light and shadow. Additionally, Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead fame composes his third soundtrack for an Anderson film and one which also invokes the era perfectly.
This is a film that blends Pynchon's and Anderson's talents to make a rich, complex, mischievous and very, very funny film, which has a hint of the aforementioned Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and a touch of The Big Lebowski about it, and like those films is like to become a cult favourite. Eminently quotable, one suspects that it will lend well itself to repeat viewings; for all of the plaudits heaped on There Will Be Blood and The Master, Inherent Vice is the Anderson film I suspect I will most want to revisit in the future.",Inherent Vice
87,shawneofthedead,"Languid, illogical and uber-weird, but not without its own surreal charm.",4,1 February 2015,"There's something to be said for movies that refuse to make things easy for the viewer - films that almost proudly meander through their plots, focused more on capturing character, atmosphere and ideas than spoon-feeding audiences brought up on a steady diet of predictable blockbusters. That is, of course, precisely the kind of work writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson produces. His latest film, Inherent Vice, is no exception. As usual, it's a complicated, complex beast of a film that defies description and categorisation. But, occasional bursts of brilliance aside, it's hard to shake the feeling that, this time around, Anderson has taken one left turn too many - leaving his behemoth of a film truly accessible to only his most devoted loyalists.In the haze and smoke of a drug-fuelled Los Angeles, way back in 1970, private investigator Doc (Joaquin Phoenix) finds himself dragged into a number of confounding mysteries. Shasta (Katherine Waterston), a former flame, begs him for help: Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), her current lover, has vanished, possibly committed to a mental asylum against his will. As Doc pries into the nebulous facts of the matter, he clashes frequently with 'Bigfoot' Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), the cop assigned to the case. Doc also stumbles upon another mystery: grieving widow Hope (Jena Malone) is convinced that Coy (Owen Wilson), her musician husband, isn't really dead. As Doc soon discovers, Coy might very well hold the key to resolving Shasta's dilemma.That may sound like a fairly simple plot, but anyone familiar with Anderson's films - and the labyrinthine Thomas Pynchon novel upon which Inherent Vice is based - should know not to take anything at face value. Indeed, Anderson's latest effort is more an exercise in mood than method. Its tale loops in and around itself, plot points disappearing into the ether as quickly as new ones emerge - none of which is necessarily resolved in a conventional way. Just as Doc wanders through his investigations in a cheerful marijuana-induced haze, so too is the film peppered with bursts of chaos and lapses in logic. It's a heady, compelling experience, to be sure, but also a curiously disengaging one that occasionally makes an ordeal out of its hefty two-and-a-half-hour running time.Surprisingly, given Anderson's penchant for dark, rich character studies, Inherent Vice plays far better as a comedy. He takes an almost gleeful delight in plunging Doc into ever more peculiar situations, surrounding him with characters sporting odd names and even odder motives. It's here that the eclectic supporting cast springs into action: Benicio del Toro oozes obfuscation as attorney Sauncho Smilax, and Martin Short delivers a deliciously barmy performance as horny dentist Rudy Blatnoyd. There's a particularly silly electricity to the byplay between Phoenix and Brolin, too, as Bigfoot - screaming in pancake houses and stringing Doc up as the culprit behind Mickey's disappearance - does his very best to confound Doc's efforts at every turn.Whenever the film threatens to meander away from its point (which is most of the time), Phoenix holds it all together. It may not be as outwardly transformative a part as he played in The Master, but is arguably more challenging for the dreamy elusiveness of his character's emotional trajectory. Phoenix hits all the right notes, even when the film doesn't - he finds an odd quirk of humanity in Doc's determination to help Shasta, an opaque femme fatale of a character (with one devastatingly and literally revealing scene), but also remains just the right touch of befuddled when the case spirals out of his control.Not many films manage to be intriguing and off-putting all at once, but Anderson pulls it off with Inherent Vice. The plot is left deliberately incomprehensible, propped up by outlandish twists involving drug cartels, secret cults and neo-Nazis. Logic is, more often than not, a secondary consideration. But the film is also a strangely effective look at a bygone era, served up with seductive slabs of Pynchon's difficult prose and an irresistible soundtrack of folk rock.

Anderson looks for the beach under the paving stones,7,27 February 2015,"For the latest installment in PTA's chronicle of weird America, he takes on Pynchon's neo-noir novel, set in the age of Nixon, Reagan and Manson, with crime and corruption at the top trickling down to the street level of dopers, hustlers, hookers, bikers and cops. The first time through, this one seemed even less accessible than ""The Master""; the second time, when I knew what to expect, I enjoyed trying to follow the shaggy-dog storyline, though the voice-over narration pastes in Pynchon's clunky prose a little too much for my taste. Not a good fit for the ""I want the last two and a half hours of my life back!"" crowd; probably best for die-hard Pynchon and PTA fans—and viewers for whom a phrase like ""a faded Country Joe and the Fish T-shirt"" still has great significance. Joaquin Phoenix does well as stoner PI Doc Sportello, basically the same kind of passive, chronically bewildered POV character he played in ""The Master""; only Josh Brolin as an LA cop called Bigfoot, Hong Chau as a perky massage parlor girl, and, briefly, Martin Short as depraved dentist Rudy Blatnoyd, emerge from the purple haze as fully rounded characters. (Belladonna, a porn star, shows off some serious acting chops as well.) Doc's main love interest, Shasta (Katherine Waterston, Sam's daughter), is meant to come across as an enchanting hippie goddess, but her big climactic [!] scene was kind of a downer. There are a few actually funny bits—a cop stops a car with four people in it, tells them that ""any group of three or more citizens"" is legally presumed to be a cult—but most of the interest comes from just seeing Pynchon's world of sinister machinations, full-service drug cartels and ""paranoid hippie bullshit"" up there on the screen. Great soundtrack—the sound on the VOD download we got from Time Warner seemed a little murky in spots; PTA cultists should wait for the Blu-ray.",Inherent Vice

90,TheMarwood,"Well made, a fun labyrinth plot, but doesn't know when to quit.",6,10 January 2015,"Inherent Vice starts off incredibly well, piling on visual gags and a crazed narrative that's hazy like a drug fever dream, but it runs out of steam and has a running time that just can't support this material. For about an hour and a half the film is quite inspired, as our perpetually stoned lead gets sucked into a labyrinth plot and one bizarre and usually fantastic character after another is thrown at this drug addled mess. The film continues at least an hour well beyond what this narrative can sustain. The pacing is off, the plot just feels deliberately muddled and while there are still plenty of jokes, the film just feels labored and exhausted after a while. Paul Thomas Anderson just didn't know when to quit on this one. The man is certainly one of the best filmmakers out there and despite Inherent Vice's shortcomings, it's still a wonderfully crafted film with some great acting - the cast is uniformly excellent. He may not have pulled off the film completely, but it's always a pleasure to see a director continue to make bold and challenging work. The film is usually episodic and feels mostly disconnected on a scene to scene basis and there really isn't a scene that doesn't work, but PT Anderson didn't exactly make enough disciplined editing choices to shape the film and trim it down.",Inherent Vice
91,bix171,Pynchon Doesn't Translate Well,5,11 January 2015,"In the end, Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of the unfilmable Thomas Pynchon seems more of a personal challenge than an artistic statement. Well, if that's the case, mission accomplished, now move on. Part of the failure of ""Inherent Vice"" is Pynchon's novel itself: he writes about a Southern California of the mind, infusing it with paranoia, absurdism and fantasy and he comes up with outlandish concepts so incredulous that putting them to film seems to heighten their falseness. But Pynchon's demented genius isn't the only reason the film is less than what it could be. Anderson's visual approach is questionable: he films his characters primarily in close-up, blotting out much of the sets; iconic SoCal images of the ocean are filmed between buildings; and there's little sense of the expanse that informs other films of his, such as ""The Master"" and ""There Will Be Blood""--the claustrophobia starts to overwhelm after a while. And this time around the performances are among the least impressive of his films: Joaquin Phoenix, as a hippie private investigator uncovering widespread corruption in L.A., repeats the slow reactions that were so maddening in ""Her"" and most of the other top-billed performers are given far too little time to make much of an impression--everyone just floats through; only an excellent Josh Brolin, as Phoenix' policeman-nemesis, lends the film any real gravitas. There just isn't enough substance to make this film count, especially towards the canon of such a important filmmaker. Hopefully, it's just an outlier.",Inherent Vice
92,themadmovieman,Totally incomprehensible and dull,2,15 February 2015,"Well, this is perhaps one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. The worst problem by a mile is that the story is totally incomprehensible. The film hinges pretty significantly on the first ten minutes or so, so make sure you're paying attention then, because it determines the whole plot, but even if you do, you'll got through this film watching this detective walk around Los Angeles and talk to various people about something or other, but you'll very rarely have any idea who's involved, why or what the hell is actually going on.And the reason that it's impossible to actually figure out what's going on as the film goes on is because the dialogue is so bad. Firstly, the actors mumble, A LOT, meaning that it doesn't really matter if they're saying anything important , because you simply can't hear what they're talking about.Secondly, the dialogue is so dull and long-winded. As I said, the trailer seems to make it all look a bit weird but still fun and snappy, but in the film, conversations go on for up to 15 minutes in one room, at the slowest pace imaginable, and when you don't know what they're talking about, you end up wondering why you're actually bothering to listen.Also, this film has a running time of 148 minutes. Now, I'm absolutely certain that they could have cut out at least an hour of this film, because there's so much unnecessary silence, staring and other pointlessness, but it's the dialogue that really draws the film out for two and a half of the longest hours you'll ever spend watching a film.Finally, the acting here is shockingly bad. You get a few chuckles from Josh Brolin here and there, but apart from that, EVERYONE here was just very poor. It's full of random cameos that the detective goes to speak to, who add a pointless extra layer of confusion to the whole story, but the worst performance by a mile was the central one given by Joaquin Phoenix.He was absolutely insufferable for the whole film, his mumbling was completely excessive, he made his character feel like too much of a stoner, which gave him a very lumbering and dull quality, and there was simply never a point throughout where I ever cared about him or what he was doing (or anyone else for that matter).Overall, this gets a 2.2 from me, because it was a horrifically dull and painfully slow film to watch, with terrible dialogue and acting, as well as one of the most incomprehensible plot's you'll ever see.www.themadmovieman.com",Inherent Vice
93,trublu215,A crime epic with a psychedelic twist,7,12 January 2015,"Inherent Vice is in no way a coherent and conventional film, to be frank, it is one of the most incoherent, manic yet entertaining films I've seen all year. Vice tells the story of private detective Doc Sporelli, a hippie stoner who is investigating the disappearance of his ex girlfriend's new lover. On paper, this seems like a run of the mill thriller, however, based on the source material of Thomas Pychon's novel, sky rockets this past anything remotely clichè. It is unlike any film you'll see and blending with Paul Thomas Anderson's impeccable directorial style, it makes for a thoroughly enjoyable period piece. While Inherent Vice is a good film, it does have some downfalls that it happily owns up to. First off, there are close to 100 (or possibly more) speaking parts which makes keeping track of any one character extremely hard. Anderson does not care about star power in this film as he is very comfortable having a big name star only in one scene and never touch base on them again. With a film this large, it is forgivable but it grows very tiring throughout its nearly two and a half hour running time. The film's issue is a complicated one, either really embrace the idea of an epic and elongate the film to make more sense of the character's motives or shorten it up and take some of those characters out completely. And judging from the onslaught of great performances, I don't really blame Anderson. The cast is as brilliant as the filmmaker behind the camera, featuring Jauoquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Jena Malone, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson and Martin Short along with many more, this film is stacked with talent. The screenplay, which Anderson wrote and adapted himself, does its source material justice but the novel itself is too big for a film. And throughout the entire film, I kept thinking that this should have been a mini-series to possibly expand on the world that Pychon has created. While I am not familiar with the source material, I do feel as though it was best suited for a film. Despite all of this, it is an engrossing film with masterful talent behind it and for that, it deserves a watch.",Inherent Vice
94,darkreignn,Left me consistently entertained and intrigued,7,5 August 2021,"I don't smoke weed, drop acid, or do any other drug besides the occasional daily double of whiskey (I'm drunk right now!), so perhaps I wasn't exactly the target audience for this film; when the characters engaged in increasingly copious amounts of drug usage, I couldn't exactly relate to what they were going through or the experiences they were having. However, my moderately straight-edge sobriety did enable me to enjoy this movie with a clear head, and full heart - as such, and after reading a plethora of other reviews, I can see that my opinion for certain aspects of the film lie contrary to popular belief.I, for one, found ""Inherent Vice"" very easy to follow. While many reviews complain, or praise, the so-called incoherent nature of the plot, I thought it was pretty straightforward and simple to understand, with elements and information revealed at an increasingly steady pace. That said, perhaps viewers were thrown off by the admittedly free-flowing nature of the story. If there's one thing that ""Inherent Vice"" doesn't have, it's a three-act structure. This movie goes from scene to scene and scenario to scenario seemingly without rule or reason, most likely in an attempt to mimic the feeling of cannabis or LSD. As someone who has never been under the influence of either (allegedly), I didn't necessarily appreciate what they were trying to do with this stream of consciousness type style, but I did somewhat like it.""Inherent Vice"" can be described as a crowd pleaser due to its sense of fun that is almost all-pervading. Yes, the story may not play out in the typical formula, and that may throw people off; in fact, at times it risked throwing me off kilter. However, I was consistently engaged by this film's comedy and style. Paul Thomas Anderson managed to include many laugh out loud moments in here. Joaquin Phoenix is just excellent as an aloof investigator, and Josh Brolin also has some ridiculous scenes (be on the lookout for the banana scene) where you won't be able to stop from belly-laughing.In addition to the comedy, P. T. manages to craft a visually stunning film, as his usual. The movie looks great, and sounds even better with a nice, but sparse, soundtrack - its scarcity makes it even more meaningful, especially when P. T. starts to play with romance. Yes, there were some very touching scenes in here, most notably with Joaquin and the beautiful Katherine Waterston, who plays his love interest, Shasta; one moment where they run in the rain together perfectly depicts a couple falling in love, and combined with the music that's playing, you won't be able to help but feel your heart swell.So the movie is funny, with a distinct visual flair and a jamming soundtrack - I mean, what's not to love? Unfortunately, quite a bit. You see, as much as I did enjoy watching this movie, there wasn't quite enough to keep me engaged from a story or character standpoint. ""Inherent Vice"" isn't the strongest contender when it comes to strong characterization; sure, you'll be able to remember who each character is, but you won't have a concrete feeling for why they're doing what they're doing. Granted, this is most likely intentional to mimic the drug-fueled haze most characters are in, but it doesn't make for a particularly compelling plot. And speaking of plot, the actual plot itself isn't very exciting. The main mystery moves forward at a steady pace, but you can tell that no character in the film is that actively involved in solving it; because of that, neither will you be. And again, that may be the point. Everyone's motivations, whether they be love, revenge, or power, are different, and because of that, there is no singular purpose for why people are doing what they are doing in this movie. And while that is interesting, it still didn't make me invested in either the characters or the story.""Inherent Vice"" is an interesting film; on one hand, the movie is entertaining, filled with great comedy, performances, style, and sound. On the other hand, it is very light on characterization, with a bland plot to boot (and don't even get me started on some of the dialogue - there is a monstrous amount of exposition here that is, truth be told, boring to listen to). But with all of my complaints, I never hated this movie. From beginning to end I found myself intrigued and entertained, and at the end of the day, that's enough for me to recommend this film to you. If you ever find yourself alone and bored on a rainy afternoon, pop this in and see if it does anything for you. You may love it, or you may hate it, but one thing is for certain: it will certainly make an impression on you.",Inherent Vice

Both Short, and the scene really distract.Otherwise, their are scenes that simply do not fit in well, I find. On the other hand when the narrative flows, its a lot of fun. Super bizarre fun.

97,Scott_Mercer,(The Big Lebowski + Chinatown) x (Pynchon + Anderson) = Awesome,9,15 December 2014,"Thomas Pynchon and Paul Thomas Anderson are a match made in filmmaking heaven. Both work on sprawling canvasses with large cohorts of quirky, well-defined characters. Both have used Los Angeles as a setting, and both know its cultural landscape like the backs of their hands.There's a reason why nobody has made a film adaptation of a Pynchon novel until now. Inherent Vice is one of his shorter, more accessible works, but no less creative, incisive or dense than his longer novels. (If anyone wanted to film V, or Gravity's Rainbow, or Mason and Dixon, a mini-series on HBO lasting 20 or 30 hours would probably be the appropriate format these days. His other short novel, The Crying of Lot 49, would be a great follow-up to this film; another tall tale set in the hills and valleys of Southern California, taking in the defense industry, the police, DaVinci code type machinations decades before The Da Vinci Code, and the entertainment machine.)Here, Joaquin Phoenix has to carry the entire film on his stoned, hairy shoulders, and he does not disappoint. Perhaps too easy a comparison, but Jeff Bridges as The Dude in the Big Lebowski just kept popping into my mind. His Doc Sportello has the distinct advantage in his profession of being constantly underestimated by the goons and crooks around him. Josh Brolin as failed actor, LAPD outcast and flatopped frenemy Bigfoot just can't seem to crush Sportello under his giant shoe. So many other great performers populate this film that come and go in a flash. I wanted to see a lot of more of Marty Short, Reese Witherspoon, Benicio Del Toro and Eric Roberts. But leaving the audience wanting more is always a much better stance than the characters overstaying their welcome.To those who complain about there being too little plot, or even, no plot at all, I must say, you didn't really get it. There is a Hero's Journey here. Doc is given a mission, and does go on a quest of Odyssean proportions. On this Journey, he encounters all kinds of monsters and discovers the failures of Hippie idealism, the triumph of cynical capitalism and the destructive exploitation of the naive in the post-Manson, pre-Watergate early 1970's. But he survives, coming out the other side with his humanity intact, based on what he does for Coy Harlingen.What exactly did he do? No spoilers here, other than to say that after it was all over, I was highly satisfied, even if a few story threads were left hanging.If you're a Pynchon fan, I would anticipate that you would enjoy this, with possibly a few small objections, but overall this is a fantastic piece of film making based on a sublime piece of writing.",Inherent Vice
98,Ziya90,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Hammett""",1,28 November 2015,"I love all the posters of the film including fan made ones... There is especially a poster which shows a sail in the sea with sparkle, but unfortunately, the film itself is not beautiful or mesmerizing like these posters. Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius and maybe not all of them, but most of his films are masterpiece if you ask me. However, this time, he seriously disappoints with this movie which has no depth, no emotion, no tension and no story that you can identify with. The director Paul Thomas Anderson is famous for powerful storytelling, offbeat stories and intense cinema feeling, but Inherent Vice is no more than a bad copy of Wim Wenders's Hammett which was a disappointment itself. Funny right? You can clearly see lots of references to Wenders's film if you are a movie buff. Inherent Vice is a nonsense detective mystery, but in fact there is not a real mystery. The beyond belief cast is lost in this pointless story unfortunately. There is no art as there is no entertainment for sure. Then what is it? Just images and characters from a director's mind? You remember some cult classics like Wild at Heart or L.A. Confidential while watching the movie, but the movie cannot deliver itself. Inherent Vice is a totally nihilistic journey. The film becomes a deadlock at one point and this happens very early in the film. Inherent Vice also suffers from being pseudo artistic. The only interesting story element in the film is the missing girl case, but the film does not deal with this, it prefers to be nihilistic. Even Josh Brolin's eccentric parody-like character loses its charm after a while. The only actor who shines in this lifeless film is Eric Roberts! Some characters have some potential but they become boring such as Owen Wilson's character, Reese Witherspoon's character. Martin Short is hilarious, but later he becomes ridiculous by his story. As for Del Toro, he is wasted. The movie has almost all the detective story elements like a missing girl, suspicious characters, exotic places, weird names, but there is no point of it. Inherent Vice is a far fetched and superficial theatricality. I hope that in the future, Paul Thomas Anderson gives up turning everything in his mind into a movie and then we can watch masterpieces shot by him.",Inherent Vice
99,CleveMan66,"""Inherent Vice"" is a well-acted, trippy adaptation, but is just a little too loopy for its own good.",5,21 July 2015,"Inherent vice (or, as lawyers know it better, latent defect) is a legal term referring to imperfections in a product that may not be obvious to the buyer or seller. In the movie ""Inherent Vice"" (R, 2:28), the term is used vaguely, seeming to apply to all the characters and situations in this gonzo period piece. I'm doing you the courtesy of explaining that up front, although the script doesn't bother to do so until late in the film – one of several minor problems I have with this otherwise inventive cinematic experience. And ""experiencing"" is a better word to apply to this movie than simply ""watching"". This movie is about creating a mood and taking the viewer (or maybe ""participant"" is a better word) on a sort of head trip through a skewed version of a specific time and place, not long ago, but not well remembered by many.The setting is Los Angeles in 1970. Although drugs and free love may not have been the way of life for the majority of Angelinos who lived through that era, there's nary a character in this story who is not involved in one or both. The central character, who is often high and liberally samples the fruit of another, is Larry Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix, sporting mutton chops that would make a Civil War general jealous). He's a private investigator with an office in a medical clinic, hence the nickname ""Doc"". Before you've had time to finish your popcorn (even if you start eating it when the previews began), Doc becomes one busy PI. His old girlfriend, Shasta, (Katherine Waterston) shows up at his groovy hippie bachelor pad to ask for his help in exposing a plot to institutionalize a very wealthy (and very married) real estate developer named Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), with whom she's having an affair. Next, a member of a black power group (Michael K. Williams) shows up at Doc's office and talks to him about finding a member of the Aryan Brotherhood who owes him money from their time together in prison. Then, a reformed drug addict (Jena Malone) calls on Doc to find her missing husband (Owen Wilson) who may or not be dead (she's not sure which). Meanwhile, Shasta and Wolfmann both suddenly disappear. But that's just the tip of the Vice-berg. While Doc is trying to find all these missing persons (whose disappearances he discovers are connected), he gets help from an attorney friend (Benicio del Toro), a brothel employee (Hong Chau) and his current girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon), who happens to be the Assistant District Attorney. But Doc has to contend with a gruff cop (Josh Brolin) with whom he has a love-hate relationship, and figure out how a nearly omnipresent member of the Aryan Brotherhood (Keith Jardine), a mysterious hit man (Peter McRobbie) and a hedonistic dentist (Martin Short) are involved in all the goings-on.Unfortunately, the plot, characters, dialog and even the acting often miss the mark. As that last paragraph shows, there's a lot going on in this movie and it can be tough to follow. Although it was cool seeing Phoenix and Witherspoon couple up again (after their award-winning roles as Johnny and June Carter Cash in 2005's ""Walk the Line"") in a movie that is so different from their last one together, these two characters being together doesn't make a lot of sense. The eloquent whimsy of the original words of Thomas Pynchon (on whose novel Anderson's screenplay is based) are hard to appreciate because of frequent rapid-fire delivery and the inconsistency with which these bursts of narrative creativity are sprinkled throughout the script. It's also tough to concentrate when important questions like why Sportello is called ""Doc"" and what the movie's title means keep coming into your mind well into the film. To site one example of the occasional shaky acting, Waterston is barely passable as a hippie chick who seems to have been hired mainly for one extended and graphic nude scene. And then, at the end of the movie, the stories that were finally tied together are not well resolved.In spite of these flaws, if you're open to going on this wild and quirky ride, ""Inherent Vice"" has a lot going for it. While setting the story in a free and flamboyant time and place, it still manages to turn those early 70s counterculture conventions sideways, using them both as background and as fodder for clever moments of humor as well as outright satire, often with a subtle early 21st century sensibility. Speaking of humor, the funny dialog is mainly concentrated early in the film and, like many of the characters, mysteriously disappears as the action progresses. However, there's physical comedy and a number of sight gags that, while often crude in nature, manage to be both in-your-face and understated at the same time. The film may remind the audience of movies from past decades, but claims a place all its own in our current decade. It's ""Up in Smoke"" with an actual plot. It's ""Natural Born Killers"" reined in. It's ""L.A. Confidential"" on a drug-induced stupor. Regardless of how you look at it, this is not your father's Hollywood movie. ""Inherent Vice"" is an unusual film and it's not for everyone, but if you're willing to roll with its special style, I think you'll find that it hits more marks than it misses.

Doc snoops into the dubious schemes of this married real estate mogul, and soon uncovers shady sex, kidnapping, murder, crooked cops, Nazi biker gangs and a Chinese heroin smuggling operation run by a lunatic dentist. In between making these discoveries, Doc gets dinged on the noggin, dates an uptight District Attorney and yearns for Shasta, who has gone missing. The film has P. T. Anderson's usual top quality talent creating some great scenes, but this excellence seems wasted on a ludicrously far-fetched plot. Most of the content is a long way from conventional mystery material, and Doc's real story may be far more mundane than the bizarre world which filters through his dope-addled brain. It's quite likely this half-baked gumshoe is merely an inmate in an insane asylum and his investigations are no more than paranoid delusions and muddled memories.

A certain degree of disorder and incoherence are as inherent in them as vice in the movie's title. And since they cannot be avoided anyway, why don't we just sit down, relax and try to accept it all as it is.This movie doesn't make much sense if you approach it with a rigid mind that only wants to follow the strict cause-effect chains. However, it does make enough sense to never become completely random and, therefore, stay enjoyable for those who are not stoned themselves. Actually, one of the things i enjoyed about Inherent Vice is how it always keeps you on that tiny border that separates having the logic of the plot in your hands (and therefore being able to predict what happens next to some extent) and being totally lost in it with an effect of ""WTF is going on"". As if you're trying to listen to people speaking a foreign language, but they are speaking so fast that although you manage to understand everything they say you don't have time to double-check it and actually make sure that you understood that right. A feeling of being in the game, but not in control of it. I guess it could frustrate some people, but i personally had no problem enjoying it.From my communication with people who consumed drugs, i understand that the drug trips can be either good or bad. It doesn't really depend on the drug itself, more on a mental state of the human that took it. The drug amplifies the mood you're in, and if you have a peaceful and relaxed state of mind then you'll be shown something enjoyable. Otherwise, be ready to face all your fears and closet skeletons powered up tenfold to tear your mental health apart.Given all that, the thing that makes Inherent Vice a good trip and a rather enjoyable flick is the ironic approach it's based on. It's not a thriller in any way. You're not forced to expect any dark revelations. And although it's hardly a comedy either, and people do shoot at each other and punch each other's faces here, there's still some kind of light-heartedness about this film. Almost like in the movies of Wes Anderson or Coen brothers: nobody promises that it all is gonna be alright and no one will get hurt, but you're still okay with it for some reason.One piece of advice i could give to the fellow cinema junkies. If you've decided to get yourself a dose of this unconventional stuff, free your mind of the prejudice and any false expectations before consumption. Let the film lead you, don't try to take it the usual way, don't tell it about the things it must and must not show you.

I am sure it is a much better novel, because I really don't know what the film was about.-I picked the trailer for Inherent Vice as my favorite trailer of the year, which sucks because it is not one of my favorite films of the year. Not even close.-The story is bloated, off topic, and confusing with no end in sight.-The pace was as slow as the dialogue.-The acting was actually pretty good. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job and deserves his Golden Globe nod. Josh Brolin has one of his best performances. Martin Short had one of his best performances. Everyone else was just acceptable.-The characters were very interesting and intricate. See, it's not all terrible of a film.-The music was fitting and I liked both the score and the album.-The costume design and visual look of the film is good.-None of it is funny. Just watch the trailer and you get to see the best of the film.-It also expected me to remember everybody's names while throwing in new names every 10 minutes. I had no idea what was happening.-Inherent Vice is also WAY more inappropriate than IMDb originally said. It is rated-R for moderate language, drug use, sexual dialogue, suggestive images, nudity, and sexual content. These are the reasons I left before the film was over. And I just did not care for it.-Inherent Vice was not funny for a comedy, is way too confusing for a crime film, and not dramatic enough to be a drama. I know I sounded harsh, but I cannot give it lower than a 6 because of its interesting characters, great acting, and music. However it deserves a low 6 for everything else and, sadly, Inherent Vice is not worth 2.5 hours of time at all.",Inherent Vice
106,lucasversantvoort,"Oh, Inherent Vice, I really wanted to like you...",6,6 May 2015,"...I really did. I'll preface this review by saying I haven't read the Pynchon novel, so don't go expecting any kind of comparisons. But yeah, when I saw the trailers and posters, my expectations soared. Finally, after the ambiguous The Master, PTA would surprise everyone with a trippy, Big Lebowski-esque parody of the detective genre. (You may recall that Iñárritu did something similar. After the crushingly serious Biutiful, he ensured Birdman didn't suffer from the same soul-crushing melodrama.) Although Inherent Vice is an occasionally fun film, I can't help but feel something's missing.The central narrative is all about a mystery, or so it might seem. Armed with a limitless supply of weed, Doc Sportello is told by his ex to look into something. She fears her current lover, real estate magnate Mickey Wolfmann, might be kidnapped soon by his wife and her lover and put in the looney bin. Doc agrees and starts looking into it and that's all I can say, not because I would be treading into spoilerish territory, but because that's all I can remember in terms of plot! Doc jumps from one conspiracy into the next, stumbling upon endless strange characters and before you know it, you don't know what's going on anymoreand that's of course precisely the point. In this sense, the film very much reminds me of The Big Lebowski. What do you remember most? The mystery or all the weird stuff along the way? Nobody's still talking about the kidnapped millionaire's wife, but the Dude's language, John Goodman's fanatical behavior, the Dude writing a check for a milk carton, the way seemingly unimportant characters and events suddenly become crucial, etc. Inherent Vice is the same. You learn to leave the plot alone and enjoy the hippy humor and oddball characters, like agent Bigfoot telling the owner of a Japanese restaurant that he wants 'motto panakeku.' The scene itself features Doc and Bigfoot discussing the central mystery, but do you remember any of that? No, we all just quote motto panakeku.This is the film's central strength: the Lebowski-esque, acid-trip humor à la the seventies. The film looks and feels authentic in this regard too: from the language and clothes to the cinematography, everything fits. But I think I wanted more humor, frankly speaking. I appreciate the subtle humor and I laughed here and there, but in what definitely feels like one overlong film purposefully designed to screw with your head, I'd have appreciated more 'out there' humor. It also doesn't help that you never come close to caring about any of these characters. As a film buff, I definitely like the idea of screwing with those viewers who're obsessed with completely figuring out plots, etc. but for me, I simply needed more comedy. It's too subtle for its own good. It's obvious Inherent Vice was made by a very talented director: see for instance the multiple visual references to the concept of Inherent Vice. Maybe my immediate suspicion that I would be seeing Big Lebowski 2.0 was wrong and maybe it's all a hidden message about the cultural downfall of America or something. PTA is one of those directors who has such a firm grasp of cinematic language that it's doubtful he could ever make a truly bad film, though it could also mean you're too devoted a fan Either way, I haven't unlocked Inherent Vice's secrets and though I want to, I'm not too inclined to go through the ordeal of watching it again which is something reserved for only the most devoted of PTA's fans. The rest of us would consider Inherent Vice to be a bad trip.",Inherent Vice
107,adrongardner,Promise of Vice. Inherent boredom.,6,24 November 2015,"Watching people do drugs is never interesting. Paul Thomas Anderson is in love with words, but while the man may have an ear, he has no timing at all. Much like The Master, a better film is in here somewhere, but this isn't quite it. Paul Thomas Anderson's stab at a Cohen Brother and David Lynch movie doesn't pay off, the laughs don't come and only Josh Brolin looks like he's having any fun.As much as the twisted, and ultimately disposable ""plot,"" zigs and zags I wished I had taken a nap half way through. By the end, I wouldn't have missed a thing. In fact, once you've passed the brothel and we wake up in the desert, there's not much left to see. Except maybe Martin Short.Juaquin Phoenix inhabits what seems to be of Hunter Thompson's lost Doppelgängers in the form of PI ""Doc,"" in search of all sorts of stuff. There's Owen Wilson eating pizza and Brolin eating weed and boy does this movie want to be funny, but most of the time it isn't. The camera lingers far too long just like most of those terrible Family Guy jokes. Phoenix is quite good most of the time - as is just about everybody - but despite the Inherent Zaniness, the movie just can't connect. Nothing really digs in to you.

109,jaredpahl,PTA's Cruel Joke. Inherent Vice Is A Movie From Hell.,1,2 December 2018,"What to make of Paul Thomas Anderson? He is simultaneously one of the most gifted filmmakers currently living, and a total hack. The director of the much-studied masterpieces Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and There Will Be Blood, is a genius when it comes to directorial craft, but a consistently absentminded storyteller. Even his best movies, including the wonderful, Adam Sandler-starring Punch Drunk Love, are bereft of a meaningful climax. PTA has a maddening tendency to carry an audience on 2+ hours of masterfully crafted odysseys, only to unceremoniously cut the story off cold in the final few minutes. He's a filmmaker I respect and ultimately hate. His psychedelic noir film, Inherent Vice, is all of his aggravating tendencies and none of his brilliant ones. This movie is a terrible, frustrating, mess. A mystery that is unfathomable, populated with detestable characters, and directed with signature pretense by the brilliant, moronic, PTA.Film noirs are often hard to follow in terms of plot. Hey, even the best noirs rely more on atmosphere than story, but Inherent Vice is on another level entirely. This thing is impossible to understand. Literally impossible. Writing this review, I can't tell you who Joaquin Phoenix's stoner protagonist is, what he is after, what (or even how many) subplots are tossed around. I cannot comprehend what Inherent Vice is about. It has all the ingredients of a mystery, I suppose, but instead of being baked into something meaningful and whole, they've been dumped on the kitchen floor. I defy anyone to tell me that these pieces make sense together. It's not as if this is the first time PTA has promised a coherent logic and settled on the hacky film snob line, ""Well, sometimes life doesn't make sense"". Buzz off, Paul!The cast, for their part, act. There isn't a bad performance, and there is even a fun cameo by Martin Short. The problem isn't the actors, it's the characters. The people we are forced to spend time with in this movie are dreadful company. Joaquin Phoenix, bless him, is insufferable. Like his role in The Master, he gives a great performance (not nearly to the level of that movie, but still) and yet, I wanted to knock his lights out every time he was on screen. He's a horrible, disgusting, scumbag. Call me old fashioned, but those are not qualities I'm dying to see in a protagonist. Nobody else fares much better. PTA has populated this film with the trashiest, smelliest, most horrible people I could ever imagine. Is it supposed to be funny that we're forced to watch them wander through this awful script for two and a half hours? If you find masochism hilarious, I guess.The best I can say of Inherent Vice is that it's The Big Lebowski without the laughs, memorable characters, or charm. In fact, it's more like the demented, Bizarro cousin of The Big Lebowski, where everything good about that film has been twisted into something horrible. What was I meant to get out of this film by the time it ended? I had willed myself to stay awake as this ""mystery"" unfolded with all the clarity and discovery of a stoner's baked-out-of-their-mind ramblings, and held back to urge to strangle myself in place of the terrible people on the screen, only to walk away furious with every single person involved. Inherent Vice is a two and a half hour trip through Hell itself. Curse you, Paul Thomas Anderson, you brilliant, abhorrent you!04/100",Inherent Vice

112,rjsf96,An Acid Trip from Heaven,10,10 February 2015,"Underrated. That's the first word that springs to my mind when I think of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest mystery cum comedy epic masterpiece. There are many adjectives to describe 'Inherent Vice'; tragic, hilarious, enticing, sexual and magnificent. Yet they do not do the film justice. This is one to watch on the big screen for sure in all its colourful glory.We are drawn into the film from the off, and are transported to the groovy seventies where everyone is either tripping out or making love. Joaquin Phoenix plays the eccentric Doc a private investigator and part time pot head. His ex-lover Shasta Fey Hepworth played by Katherine Waterstone with sexiness and charm asks him for a favour, he must investigate the eluding Mickey Wolfmann. What follows is a cascade of confusing, illuminating and ultimately wondrous scenes, all of which make up a grand whole.Phoenix undoubtedly gives us a performance like no other. He is always fun to watch and lights up the screen whenever he appears. From the way his character moves to how he interacts with others he bedazzles us and effortlessly. It's almost as if this is an actual person, the way he embodies his characters innate quirkiness.You may be curious as to whether the supporting players are noteworthy and they all are. From the brutish Josh Brolin playing a police cop to the stoned laid back Jena Malone all of them bring something together. They make this fascinating tale fell real and grounded which is exceptional given that the further the film unravels the more the audience begins to feel that they are high. If I was to just talk about other characters then my review would be never ending – they are that well realised.Now, many have taken issue with the films storyline. The further that Doc embarks on his quest the more confusing all the plot points become. But Paul Thomas Anderson is aware of this fact and he takes it into consideration. Later in the film we see Doc filling out a white board with all the separate names and connections. He stares at it in bewilderment, just like the audience trying to explain the plot to a friend. But do not fear this mind boggling plot has a purpose. You can never second guess the film and it always keeps you on your toes. Surely this is the essence of cinema? Everyone that worked on the film must have realised that they have crafted something that will be talked about for years, scratch that decades to come. It is very close to other hardboiled detective stories like 'The Big Sleep', but this is deliriously entertaining for audience members of practically any age from teenagers to adults. It also means that to re-watch the film is to gain further understanding of it. The fact that this film is in a haze of smoke only adds to its grand scale.For a film just shy of 150 minutes it never feels bloated or unnecessary, all of the scenes lead to somewhere. Whether that be one of the funniest scenes in the film. As Doc remarks to one guy 'Does that man have a swastika on his head'? To which he replies 'It isn't. It is an ancient Hindu symbol meaning that all is well'. I do not remember laughing this much for a long time.For fans of Paul Thomas Anderson it will come as no surprise that the film looks awesome. Whether that be the neon glow of green from signs or the over saturated orange faces, the colours leap off of the screen. Dare I say it gave me joyous celebration enough to feel like a six year old who had just been handed crayons and a drawing pad. Just like 'A Most Violent Year' perfectly captured the dark look of the eighties, 'Inherent Vice' translates the seventies to the screen with mesmerizing results. If only I had a time machine.The soundtrack only adds to the sense of fun which the screen offers by the barrel load. Almost anyone anywhere in need of a good time and high entertainment value would be a fool to miss 'Inherent Vice'.Paul Thomas Anderson has woven a seamless, energetic if not entirely understandable film into a masterwork of art and beauty. Even if we are confused at least it gives us more reason to come back to the film time and time again why should we not be thankful? The screen shines brightest with Phoenix at the helm, supporting characters and even Reese Witherspoon are true acting talent to be reckoned with and the cinematography will leave you drooling for more. It has to be said that this is the most stunning film I have seen from the twenty first century. The script is witty and devoted with loving care, the music turns the cinema into a disco and most importantly the film always intrigues and never ever thinks of the audience as dumb. If you do not have the time of your life with 'Inherent Vice' then you may have to reconsider whether you have had any fun in your life at all.",Inherent Vice
113,vistheindian,Inherently not wise,4,16 February 2015,"Quickie Review:After the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend, Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) takes on the case to find out what really happened. While investigating the disappearance, Doc gets tangled in a web of conspiracies involving many colorful and oddball characters. Paul Thomas Anderson is a highly respected director with many great successes. Inherent Vice, is just not one of them. While the cast is solid in their acting ability, the script is so packed full of content that it makes the entire film incoherent. A disappointing film that could have been so much more if the fat was trimmed off and got right to the meat.Full Review:When I first saw the trailer for Inherent Vice, I wasn't sure what the movie was about. However, the style and incredible cast got me excited that this could be something special. Now that I have seen the movie I am still not too sure what this movie is about.The two things that did get me excited for this movie is actually its biggest strengths. Stylistically this is a great looking film. There is a constant motion to the scenes whether it be the actors or even a simple slow zoom. This added a lot to the sense of urgency. Of course the colorful sets and costumes pull you right into the 70's world. As for the acting, I can't believe the amount of well- known and talented actors in this film. Sure not all of them have a major part and are relegated to cameos, but these cameos were some of the best parts of the movie. The lead actors Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin had a great rivalry in the film, and watching them clash numerous times led to some good laughter.Inherent Vice is probably going to be one of the most divisive movie of the year. You are either going to love it for its complexity, or hate it for well, for its complexity. I personally fell under the latter group. This is a very dialog heavy movie, it went for a mix of The Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction. Those are two great movies where the dialog is used effectively to tell us more about a character, even if they are just talking about a TV show they like. However, in Inherent Vice the conversations keep meandering to no end without any purpose. It felt like the characters were in a competition to see how many different names they can drop in a conversation to confuse the audience (and I thought following who is who in Game of Thrones was hard). The movie demands your 110% attention, but it doesn't do anything to deserve it. Even if you give it the attention the pay off at the end is just not worth the effort.Unless you are Paul Thomas Anderson fan, I say skip this one. You are not missing out on a masterpiece, and even the fan would agree that this is Anderson's weakest work. This movie will test your patience and I saw 8 or 9 people out of 35 leave the cinema before the movie ended. And I don't really blame them for it, I completely understand.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Inherent Vice
114,eryui,A lot of style between entertainment and boredom,7,16 April 2016,"I can't say this movie, it is not well done. The actors are good, Joaquin Phoenix is great. The stages are good. It catches enough well the ""peace, love and psychedelics"" 70's hippies time. The photography is good. The characters are interesting. There are some hilarious moments and dialogs. So what? In my personal opinion, the problem is that, overall, like in others Paul Thomas Anderson's movies, the plot seems secondary, messy, and mainly not really gripping. It exceed the limit of patience and interest, but without any redemption, if not for some nice found, right till the end.So, while I really appreciated the cinematography's art present in here, the line between entertainment and boredom has been exceeded.6+/10",Inherent Vice

All that convoluted story line and bizarre characters made it look like a complete mess for me. I didn't feel for any of characters, I felt like so what's point of all this. Since it fails to invest you in its story, the dialogue and the interactions felt completely dry. Also it drags on almost 2 and half hours. This was my first Paul Thomas Anderson film and maybe his directorial style isn't my taste. I haven't read the book also.

117,SimonD1900,Good cast. Weird movie.,10,11 July 2019,"Holy stuff!! This is a weird one. Long too. Pretty simple plot but still becomes somewhat complex to follow, but not overly so. It's messy and even a bit suralistic at times, that makes it hard to focus on the actual plot, and I belive that is intended. But if you manage, the plot is actually not that complex as it's seems, it's actually kind of straight forward.Joaquin Phoenix plays a private investigator, called ""Doc"", that moves about in L.A during the hippie scene in the 60/70s, probably 70s. He is a pot smoker and somewhat known loser around town. He is using his contacts, people skill and wits, to solve a case about a missing billionaire and the case also involves a ex girlfriend, so it has personal value to him. This chase takes him on a ride and we as the viewers as well. And it's kind of a weird messy and sometimes hilarious ride in a 2:26 hour run time, with drug use as a theme. This movie is hard to put in a gener but if I would try, I'd say a crime/drug/comedy, it's not your average movie, not at all. I can see if many turn this off somewhere in the first 3rd, I would fully understand, because this movie can really awaken the feeling ""what the heck am I watching?"" You wonder what is going on, what's the point, why was this made, who wrote this, what were they thinking?
Hard to tell. It's probably about preference. If you enjoy Big Lebowski or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, you might like this one. Even though this will probably never be viewed as a classic in the same way those two films has.Well, to my personal opinion. I absolutely loved this! Even if I had to paus it two times, beacuse it was kind of losing me watching it late at night. But I paused it beacuse I didn't want this to happen, I really wanted to view it taking in as much as I could, so I paused for a bit an regained my focus on the film.
What did this movie give me? Over all, it was entertaining, even if a bit slow at times, but even more so, it was an expirence, a fun ride with quorki characters in a warm likeable setting, but still with some unsettledness to it also, realistic but still unrealistic. And Joaquin Phoenix is great in it, the character he creates is uniq, and in a subtle way, he's using body language, his eyes, tone of voice and off course dialoug, to create this almost timeless philosophical persona of a somewhat cartoonish character, which to me was really likeable. And it's a good cast overall. The movie has this atmosphere that gave me a good feeling. It's worth one watch at least. To me, it's actually a full score. I just loved this movie, I don't really know why, just did.",Inherent Vice
118,vsks,Freewheeling Absurdist Comedy - Almost Plot-Free,7,13 July 2015,"When this film of a Thomas Pynchon novel was released in 2014, critics said it was undoubtedly the ONLY Pynchon book that could be corralled into a film. I'm a big Pychon fan—loved V, The Crying of Lot 49, and Mason & Dixon—but I started Gravity's Rainbow three times and never got past page 100. So I can sympathize with the difficulties director Paul Thomas Anderson must have faced. Joaquin Phoenix plays ""Doc"" Sportell, a private investigator subject to regular harassment from a police detective called Bigfoot (Josh Brolin). Doc's ex-girlfriend Shasta has taken up with a wealthy married property developer, and the developer's wife wants her to cooperate in a plot to institutionalize him so she and her new boyfriend can raid his bank account. Then the magnate disappears. This set-up takes you down colorful and unexpected byways, which I couldn't possibly reconstruct, and a multitude of stars provide performance gems: Owen Wilson as a mixed up dude-dad, afraid to leave the drug cult that's captured him; Hong Chau as the hilariously matter-of-fact operator of a kinky sex club; Martin Short as a cradle-robbing dentist, with his clinic in a building shaped like a golden fang; Golden Fang itself, a mysterious criminal operation that . . . None of this probably matters. Neo-Nazi biker gangs, yogic meditation, stoners. You just have to go with it.

I guess that's the point, though, what use that point has is beyond me.It's beautifully shot. The cinematography is fantastic, like in all of Anderson's film.

The scenes with Martin Short steels the entire movie. I wish Martin Short did more movies and strange roles like this one. All the other actors are amazing as well.Here's the thing though... Noir films are often confusing, but if you pay close attention you can usually connect the dots. This was nearly impossible to follow. What's real? What's not? Millions of names and characters being thrown at you every five minutes. The whole time I'm think, ""how does this guy even know where to go next?"". Despite this, I still felt inclined to watch.

(Then, you're *used* to the paranoia!)Again: Getting the opportunity to see it at a $2 Tuesday rate at the Mission Theater in Portland gave me the chance to sit back and appreciate how many scenes had been constructed from a wide-ranging cultural map with each character drawn sharply with respect to age, role in life, and countercultural (or counter-countercultural) alliance.Who's up for a trip, full of longing and loss and weird ways of getting by, including paying the rent by doing commercials to appeal to people you despise or tracing down folks the Government has ""hired"" to do Who Knows What? (""Clients pay me, Doc. Clients pay me, Doc."") You won't believe how much is packed into this movie, if you just saw it once; you could actually use the DVD to chew on a scene, skip back and forth, and chew on another; there're all self-contained ""worlds in themselves""!Thumbs up! Somebody give this Paul Thomas Anderson guy a green light for his next picture. I think that kid's going places!",Inherent Vice
125,baumhenrik,I don't know what to think,6,21 August 2019,"Seen this movie without knowing anything about it but I thought I'd give it a try.
The characters of the show are more or less all quite interesting and well acted. Especially Joaquin Phoenix and Katherine Waterston did a very good job and of course a little Benicio del Toro is always nice to watch. But oh boy the plot of this movie was so weird and hard to follow that at the end of the movie I felt like I missed most of it even though I payed attention. I felt like there were too many names and characters that left an open spot in the plot. I mean watching the characters was entertaining for the most parts but understanding them was impossible to me.

128,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Inherent Vice',7,17 January 2015,"""Inherent vice in a maritime insurance policy is anything that you can't avoid. Eggs break, chocolate melts, glass shatters, and Doc wondered what that meant when it applied to ex old ladies."" Paul Thomas Anderson's seventh film and first book adaptation, based off of the 2009 novel of the same name by American novelist and MacArthur Fellow Thomas Pynchon, the only novel of his ever adapted in film to date. Know for his dense and complex works, those who have not read his book found the plot extremely frustrating to follow. However I heard that it wasn't the case for those that actually did read the novel and were in the loop while watching the flick what was going on, while the other audience members (myself included) were left out, as one would be upon hearing an in-joke for example. 'Inherent Vice' had an explanatory meaning in and of itself: it is the tendency in physical objects to deteriorate because of the fundamental instability of the components of which they are made, as opposed to deterioration caused by external forces. A perfect summation regarding the story of a stoned sleuth; deterioration of not only the disappearance of someone but of the brain cells from getting into a high stupor. Paul Thomas Anderson, adapting Pynchon's hazy novel thus, sums up this definition to irritating perfection, dragging us into two hours plus of long takes, slow monologues and characters I could not relate with or hardly care about in the least. It all worked, of course, firstly because, its Paul Thomas Anderson, and secondly the film was set it California 1970, where practically everyone's mind was off in a cannabis-laden fog somewhere post the Manson murders, Watergate and 'Nam. Did the film follow up with Pynchon's novel as dense and complex as well? Let's take a look.Shaggy-haired, mutton-chopped pothead P.I. Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) lives in a rickety beach house in the fictional town of Gordita Beach in sunny California, 1970. His ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) visits him, telling the hippie detective about her new lover, Mickey Wolfman (Eric Roberts), of whom is a wealthy real estate developer. She then asks Doc to prevent a plot by Mickey's wife and her lover to have Mickey abducted and committed to the looney bin. Doc complies and begins the investigation. Upon doing so, he comes across quite a few interesting people for questioning the dilemma at hand: a former member of the Black Guerrilla Family who hires him to find one of Mickey's white supremacist bodyguards who is a member of the Aryan Brotherhood. From further investigations and questioning lead Doc to other characters of the times, such as a brothel manager named Jade (Hong Chau), of which what she likes to eat can only be fulfilled by her employee Bambi, to an eccentric crack-sniffing and paranoid dentist (Martin Short). Sauncho Smilax (Benicio del Toro), though not an actual criminal lawyer, is willing to help either the police or Doc indiscriminately on the case as well. When the clean-cut, post-flower child-prejudiced Lt. Det. Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin) of the LAPD enters and tries to get Doc to be an informant for the police, he refuses. Doc is also hired later on by Hope Haringen (Jena Malone), of whom is looking for her missing husband, Coy, (Owen Wilson), a saxophone player. On the side, Doc is having an affair with the dashing Deputy DA Penny Kimball (Reese Witherspoon) while always managing to puff a drag to have his addiction fed and his sanity kept while surrounded by a world infested with drugs, money and vengeance.Though meandering and easily Anderson's weakest film to date, cinephiles will only want to go to see his latest for the namesake of the director, which for me sitting through the thing was a certifiable test of endurance. To be honest, the colorful poster with its title in neon lettering drew me in more than the actual film did. Still an admirer of P.T. Anderson's work, here, this film is sadly forgettable with throw-away jokes and lacking Mr. Anderson's essence of what he can really do as a director regarding pushing the envelope and writing strong character development as well. 'Inherent Vice' may give an occasional nod to the End of the Hippie Dream and also be lazily rolled up while spiraling and swirling out puffs of half-hearted comedy, but I just found this the only film of his the hardest to sit through. I was in my own mentally-drugged daze of confusion as the lights of the theater went on afterwards as to what the deal was in what went wrong. Mesmerizing but demanding one's patience, and having less in common with 'The Big Lebowski' for the sake of comedy, it should at least be sat through once to keep a sober mind, disregarding some of the said characters of the film. With that said, go check out this groovy movie, but don't have your expectations set too high, and don't get high either afterwards, though this film makes you feel like doing so just to make you think off all the time you could have been doing something productive. Maybe I'm missing something, maybe a lot. The aftereffects post-viewing haven't completely worn off yet. At least the scene where 'Bigfoot' kicks down Doc's door just to eat the contents of his ashtray was disgustingly memorable, perhaps a metaphor of the gruesome highlights regarding American history the citizens were experiencing at the time. Just remember to beware the ""Golden Fang"" and remember that a frozen chocolate-dipped bananas is a truly tasty treat. Far out, man. Wait, what was I reviewing again?",Inherent Vice
129,jkbonner1,If only it could have broken through its marijuana haze,6,23 January 2015,"I'd like to give this movie a higher rating. I like Joaquin Phoenix. He's a good actor. The rest of the actors in the movie were good, and some very good, given the roles they had to play. Paul Thomas Anderson, the director, has shown he is a master of his trade. He directed both There Will Be Blood (2008) and The Master (2012), both outstanding movies.The protagonist of The Master, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is a sociopath. A sociopath is out to get where he wants to get, and he has no difficulty using other humans as stepping stones to where he wants to get. Dodd relies chiefly on persuasion and manipulation that he has the answer to everything. The protagonist of There Will Be Blood, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), is a sociopath who will do whatever it takes to make it big in the then-new oilfields of California. He relies on persuasion and manipulation too, but will resort to murder. He is more violence-prone than Dodd. But they're cut from the same cloth.The reason I mention the above two movies is that both Dodd and Plainview hold strange and unsettling ideas. Sociopaths very often end up believing in themselves. But both fit into a setting that is ultimately understandable if you take them at face value. Not so in Inherent Vice. Everyone is just weird, even the protagonist, Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), whether they're high as a kite or not. OK so back in late '60s-'70s lots of people drifted through life stoned out of their gourd. That said, the movie's a confused tangle of murder; crazy cops; FBI kidnappings of bigtime real estate moguls; dentists off their rockers; Asian ladies warning of the Golden Fang (Chinese tong, smuggling drug dealers, or an association of dentists? Who knows?); ex-girl friend who may, or may not, be threatened. Who knows? She sure knows how to make great loving though.Anderson wrote the screenplay for both There Will Be Blood and Inherent Vice. There Will Be Blood was based on Upton Sinclair's novel by the same name. And although the movie itself has many dark and strange facets, it doesn't miss its mark. Anderson possibly could have done better in adapting Thomas Pynchon's book by the same name to make it more of a dark comedy (I'm assuming with one of Pynchon's books that that could be done although that might very well be the problem here).Inherent Vice's too loose and flighty, even for LA in 1970. And although there are a few scenes that evoke smiles and laughs, there're not enough to them. Charlie Manson is mentioned at least twice in the movie, but unless you knew who he was and what he did, you wouldn't think anything of it. Charlie and his gang of crazed devotees ended the age of innocence that made the '60s what it was. Reality came crashing down and busted up the party.The other thing I didn't get was the accompanying music. The late '60s was the era of classic rock. Where was it in the movie? The music didn't suggest flower children LSD tripping either. What did it suggest exactly? Who knows?You could just chalk the whole thing down as one big doped out hallucinatory romp of Doc Sportello, who had marijuana smoke almost coming out his ears. Maybe that's the best way to enjoy Inherent Vice. Watch strange characters (well-acted too) drift in and out of strange scenes that may, or may not, have any connection to anything else in the movie. Who knows? Well, here you might be tempted to say, the Shadow knows. But maybe he was the guy who got bumped off at the beginning. The movie should have been titled Inherent Whackiness. The problem I had was all of it got a bit cloying after awhile. But Anderson deserves credit for his shot at trying to adapt a Pynchon book into movie format. Sadly, it didn't quite cut it.As an aside, a movie that more realistically captures the pulse of the early '70s scene in LA is Wonderland (2003).6/10",Inherent Vice
130,j-madej,"To simply put it ""Inherent Vice"" is a peculiar movie...",7,2 February 2015,"It is sort of a weird feeling when you've watched a movie spanning two and a half hour that you are not fully sure if you liked it or not. On one hand you appreciate the craftsmanship of the filmmaking, ultra realistic depiction of hippie driven Los Angeles of the 70's, on the other, the story which is complicated beyond necessity where stakes are not really high enough. ""In a California beach community, private detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) tends to work his cases through a smoky haze of marijuana. One day, Shasta, a former lover, arrives out of the blue to plead for Doc's help; it seems that Shasta's current beau, rich real-estate tycoon Mickey Wolfmann, has a wife who may be plotting to commit him to a mental hospital. When Mickey and Shasta both disappear, Doc navigates a psychedelic world of surfers, stoners and cops to solve the case.""On one hand the story sound straight forward, but due to the fact that it is seen through the eyes of a stoner the narration has sometime sleepy or often full of anxiety style, which not all viewers will enjoy. The actual film is narrated by Joanna Newsom who plays Sortilège who is telling us the story of a privet eye Larry ""Doc"" Sportello brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix. Originally Robert Downey Jr. was casted in this role but Paul Thomas Anderson felt he might be too old for the part. It must be said that Phoenix's performance is superb and in a way he maintains our interest when he is on the screen. He is very natural and at times he is almost too underplayed. However where this film truly excels is in supporting cast specially Josh Brolin stands out of the bunch, as a frustrated, beaked banana eating cop, who takes his frustration of loosing a partner on Phoenix's character. He always have something phallic in his mouth and as we get to know his character he is pushed around by his wife which aggravates him even more. During the movie they bond in some weird way which by the end, culminates with some weird pot eating scene which sort of comes out of the blue, venturing on to a surreal territory.In many ways ""Inherent Vice"" feels disjointed, based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon which I think as book the story might have worked much better. To simply put it ""Inherent Vice"" is a peculiar movie...Normally I like work of Paul Thomas Anderson, but this one is really weird. As I mentioned already the 70's vibe is spot on, the art design is very realistic for the time period as well as the costume design. All the performances are very solid specially Joaquin Phoenix, but the film as whole does not work for me...It's just...peculiar...as the audience we too often disengage from the film to truly appreciate it. Also the length of it being 148 minutes seems much too long and after about 120 minutes you can't wait to end. On a positive note there are few moments where you will laugh out loud, but they are spread apart too much to truly call ""Inherent Vice"" your typical comedy. Personally I wanted to see it because I am a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson's previous work, but to be perfectly honest with you, my life would have been complete without seeing this one. Decide for yourself, something was missing here and to be honest it is hard to point out what it is. It's just that the experience was not as immerse full as I was hoping for.For more of my film reviews go to: https://www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Inherent Vice
131,supatube,"Kinda funny, kinda long, kinda slow, kinda brilliant",10,2 April 2015,"Private Detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) is in a constant haze of smoke. An old flame, Shasta (Katherine Waterson), comes to visit consumed by the idea that her new lover's wife is plotting to have him institutionalized and Doc should help her out. After Shasta and her lover disappear Doc floats through a series of oddly intoxicating scenarios to find the truth. Lt. Det. Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin) and Doc share some of the most uproarious scenes. But the best moments come from the sub characters with sometimes only one scene. Hong Chau's sassy mouthed, parlor-working hooker Jade is worth the admission ticket. Jeannie Berlin has this tiny pearl of a moment as the aunt on the phone. Jena Malone's version of reformed white trash in the psychedelic age is genius. It's all really well crafted. The assembly may be disjointed, or so it may appear.There were a few people in the screening who fell asleep. The story moves slowly. Whispering jokes between characters are frequent. Mumbling potheads are a prerequisite. Confusion takes president. And it's a long movie with lingering scenes. But is that not the point when we're dealing with a slow detective in a constant foggy daze? Paul Thomas Anderson is a character driven storyteller. He scored most praise for the Oscar winner ""There Will Be Blood"" with the climatic final scene. But his Oscar nominated ""Boogie Nights"", where the climax was in the beginning and the rest of the film was cleaning up that euphoric mess, is a lot more aligned with ""Inherent Vice"". Both films start off with more humor and slowly descend into reality. The irreverence from the characters glorifies their existence. The drugs, sex and lifestyle are somewhat appealing. Until that descent into reality reveals the sadness behind all that cool looking stuff. Although the connection lies more in the way the two tales unfold and develop rather than the obvious connections of drugs, sex and obsession. An epic representation of the hippie movement and how monomania became its downfall - this is hardly a line that will garner any interest from the public. But there it is. The intricate and well-developed characters are merely an aspect to decorate the true protagonist – the hippie consciousness. And who else to bring this scope of a story to life other than the man who created the story of a porn star to highlight the change from film in the 70's into tapes of the 80's? Inherent Vice, by definition, is the deterioration of something from the inside as apposed to external aspects. The detective story of a man trying to find an old girlfriend he's still in love with is the story inside. What are the external forces? The paranoia of change is what should be noted. The hippie consciousness was a fail, while the world was changing from the 60's into the 70's it did not go the way of free love and psychedelics. Paranoia, the unavoidable inherent vice.This movie was a brilliant hybrid of genre, shocking drama, hilarious comedy and an intriguing mystery that plods from one clue to the next. The acting is perfection. Even when the characters personal dramas become confusing it merely highlights that the characters are utterly confused. I think this film will fare badly with critics and audiences alike however, its one of those films where I feel history may see it different.",Inherent Vice
132,Chance_Boudreaux19,Felt like an incomprehensible inside joke,4,20 November 2020,"PTA is one of the most talented directors working today, if not of all time. Unfortunately, Inherent Vice is the only movie of his that I just don't understand. Or rather I don't understand why he and other people think this is a good story. I understand the ideas behind it being a love letter to a bygone era that also serves as a noir parody with wacky characters. What I don't understand is why this way of telling the story got so much acclaim. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a great example of a film with little plot that gets by on the strength of the characters and manages to invoke feelings of nostalgia for an era which I never experienced. Inherent Vice isn't able to do that and its characters whilst sometimes amusing become grating as the dialogue and situations become increasingly puzzling. Finally, the jokes just aren't funny to me, apart from a few brief instances. The movie as a whole reminded me of Altman's The Long Goodbye which was yet another movie that I just couldn't understand. Both of them feel like inside jokes that I tried to be a part of as I scratched my head in confusion trying to figure out what the hell is going on. And maybe that's my problem, maybe I should've gone with the flow and embraced the weirdness. But most likely it's just not a style that will ever appeal to me and I will never fully comprehend the appeal of this film, even if I read a thousand explanations.",Inherent Vice

Set in 70's southern California, this pot-smoking private detective has been called in to explore the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend's married lover.Shasta (Katherine Waterston) is Doc's ex, property tycoon Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts) is her lover. But when she too goes missing, Doc unearths a tangled web of corruption, drug running and many other misdemeanours. In amongst neo-Nazi bikers, dodgy dentists, rehab centres and communes, lurks one shady character after another. Michael K Williams, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Benicio Del Toro, Martin Short all play characters who fall within this category, and you can count Doc in amongst them too. Josh Brolin outdoes everyone bar Doc, as ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen who gets the most screen time alongside Doc. Sporting an ultra-serious buzz-cut and a lack of personality to match, Bigfoot hates hippies and despises Doc. Time after time, he tries to frame Doc for crimes he didn't commit. A fractious partnership of sorts develops, to see if they can figure out whats going on in the sun-drenched Californian underworld.'Inherent Vice' is a rambling pulpy caper where little really happens over its overlong 2.5 hours. Its splintered, open-ended narrative is not an issue in itself, the film tries too hard to be unconventional and cool, especially the comedic elements which barely got a laugh. I don't even mind the convoluted plotting, or that it doesn't even makes any sense, in fact nothing in it seemed remotely peculiar. I did resent having to listen so hard at what many of the underdeveloped characters were saying, 2.5 hours is a lot of incoherent mumble to get through.At least the ever watchable Phoenix remains just that with the splendidly affable Doc. Joanna Newsom's narration was a plus, especially to those who like me haven't read a Thomas Pynchon book before. Nevertheless 'Inherent Vice' remains an exasperating bore.",Inherent Vice

His mutton chops are marvellous, the only two things of consistency on the hairy visage of the PI investigating an ever expanding, and ever more incomprehensible, soup of detail and dilemma.There will be moments when you can't hear what people say, just like real life. There will be moments when ridiculous coincidence combine with chaotic consequence, just like real life. There will be stories that vary greatly according to the reliability of your narrator and our perspective of the viewer, let alone the cosmic chaos that often attends chronic narcotic engagement (allegedly...the PLOT, just like ReAL life).It looks proper, it sounds perfect for what it looks like, it looks old and nostalgic and warm and involving. There's all kinds of cunning little cultural references and curious red herrings that bounce around and then every now and then, they come together in an engrossing but emotionally muted manner that might feel a little cold. Although it gets a bit hot and sweaty as well on occasion.It has a gentle comedy and the reunion at the heart of the movie gets slightly lost in a messy meta theme of madness and marijuana where one can't help suspect that Anderson has deliberately infused things with more Bogart shots that has been seen since Casablanca. I almost wished this was a scratch and smoke production.I confess that I had had at least two pints of beer in the pub before going to see this. Sit back, relax, breath 4-7-87 and let the world wash over you for a little while, it's an enjoyable if somewhat confusing place to be at times.

It seemed free, dopey and careless enough to make me want to experience it. And after all - this is Paul Thomas Anderson's work. Not that I am a strict follower of his films, but they all show some resemblance to each other. It is not that easy to represent the social tides in a truthful to the original manner. And the director has done it again. I very much liked his movie ""The Master"" and ""Inherent vice"" is even better and more sophisticated in a way.First I have to give it all to the actors - Joaquin Phoenix, Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin. All of them perfectly cast and gladly enjoyed as late hippie-era characters. They represent very good this feeling of almost getting what you want, but not exactly. As there is no full happiness, so there is no full description of that epic era of social change. The early 1970's is the time when these people began to lose momentum and were already feeling the pressure which the state was apply on them.This counterculture has grown to a point where it threatened the established order and power distribution. And that is why the hippies were denied their rightful position in society and this tendency became a symbol of a movement led by outsiders, strangers from the mass. But this is not what it is, this is not what it should be.My main impression from this movie is that the director wants to convey his vague impression of what we as people could have been and could have done, if history hasn't been led by powerhouses which exploit the natural human fears, weaknesses and desires. All the characters of this film are aware that they are not in control of their lives, they are unsatisfied, they strive to achieve more, but cannot do so, because they are influenced, led, used and left behind. Only ""Doc"" is drifting as an ambiguous epitome of self sufficient libertarian hippie. He and his delusional ex-girlfriend Shasta coincidentally repeat twice the slogan of the movie (at least I think that this is it) ""This doesn't mean that we're back together. - Of course not.""It is most important to note that we don't see a coherent storytelling or sequential human relationships, turning a plot into a message. We witness a fragmented story of characters which live in a time which is different than the one they were born into. For me it is crucially important to feel the emotional state and the atmospheric resemblance of this film and to share it. Because one cannot rationalize what is already lost, but can experience this reminiscence of counterculture ideas and epicurean lifestyle.",Inherent Vice

Simple enough beginning, although their conversation is very vague and talks around the basics, which is what all 2 1/2 hours of this movie will continue to do. She doesn't tell him what she wants him to do, just that she needs his help somehow. Then she disappears, having given him exactly as much information as I just gave you.Our pothead protagonist, a private investigator named Doc, knows about half of the people in Southern California. We meet them all. We also meet all of the people in Southern California whom he doesn't know. By the end of this movie, he knows everyone, and everyone has been trotted across the screen for us to figure out their varying degrees of relevance to anything.Fans of Raymond Chandler get this kind of mystery plot, very dense and vague, and by the end you couldn't really explain whatever had been going on the whole time, but you have a sense of how it ends and whether or not things turn out well. This is that kind of story.Normally when a sprawling, complicated mystery novel is adapted to the screen, it is trimmed down considerably. LA Confidential, for example, which jettisoned half of the book. Inherent Vice on the other hand sets out to cover all of the characters and plot of its source novel. This makes for a very confusing and frustrating viewing experience, where character after character shows up very briefly and then vanishes, having made very little apparent contribution to what's going on. They're all very pretty and funny while they last, though.Joaquin Phoenix as Doc looks like Wolverine and acts like Johnny Depp. The concept of the hippie or beatnik detective has been done before, like Eliot Gould in The Long Goodbye or Richard Dreyfuss as Moses Wine in The Big Fix. Those are really good 70's movies. this is also a really good 70's movie except that it was made in 2014, which begs the question, what's the point of having made it? Since the plot remains so vague, it's not about the story. Character-wise, we have a love story, and we have a little family that needs saving (though typically for this kind of confuser they are usually just hinted at). If anything, the film seems to be an experiment in trying to build a mystery potboiler around an actor who stays high the entire time.The conclusion that I draw is that PT Anderson undertook this film as a personal challenge, to put a complicated and dense mystery on screen while remaining faithful to its source, while filming with a leading man who is constantly baked.

I often found myself bored, just wanting things to happen, and the loose stoner style of the dialogue becomes tedious pretty quickly.The story isn't particularly complicated, but I didn't find it very interesting either and none of the characters were especially likeable or unique, making it hard to connect with them as the film developed. Well made but not among my favourites from PTA.",Inherent Vice
142,DavidLindahl,"Weird Thomas Anderson film, not bad but still not likely to make a mark",6,7 April 2016,"Paul Thomas Anderson is an incredibly interesting filmmaker. He writes and directs his own films, and releases a new feature once every other year. With such heavy films from his past like, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood and the funny drama comedy Punch-Drunk Love, I had great expectations on Inherent Vice.Inherent Vice is based on the book by the same name, and is set in the 70's. The story is about Doc, played by Joaquin Phoenix, a cannabis smoking private detective who gets a visit from his ex- girlfriend. She wants him to investigate a plot against her lover, the wealthy real estate developer, Mickey Wolfmann. He soon gets drawn into multiple cases and a large underground smuggling organization.Paul Thomas Anderson lets us follow the story through the eyes of Doc, and Joaquin Phoenix is present in nearly every scene. He does a great job in portraying Doc the cannabis smoking hippie. Josh Brolin is also part of the film in a supporting role as the aggressive policeman Bigfoot, whose agenda from time to time, is really hard to tell.The music is a strong element in the film and Paul Thomas Anderson really has a feeling for finding the right music and songs to fit in every scene. The film goes on in a relatively slow pace and it does take its time in building up the story, which becomes more advanced for every minute. Inherent Vice is sometimes very confusing and unclear, but at the same time that's part of its charm and meaning. We as an audience feel the same confusing feelings that Doc does, as he dives deeper into the plot.Inherent Vice was an interesting film, but it may need a rewatch or two, to make you fully appreciate its content.",Inherent Vice
143,Serge_Zehnder,Inherently Human,9,16 February 2015,"I haven't read a single line of Thomas Pynchons prose thus far. But after watching Paul Thomas Andersons sublime work based on one of his books, I must say, it would be a sad state of affairs to leave this world without having read some of Mr. Pynchon's words.This weird tale of corruption, sex, greed, counter-culture and lost chances may rank among the finest recreations of the much epitomized sixties in America. During it's entire running time I had to think about ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" more than once. ""Inherent Vice"" seems to be strangely connected to Hunter S. Thompsons work and Terry Gilliam's adaption, which also showed the afterglow of this decade of idealism. And both movies star Benicio Del Toro as a lawyer.Within the plot of a detective story lies a very touching core concerning a generation of thrill-seekers"" as Thompson wrote, who were ready for everything except some sort of real intimacy. The acting is as perfect as can be, and the production design, sound, camera-work are as it has become a trademark of the director and his collaborators, specific and fully realized.So, after having heralded the obvious, there's one last note to be made. The movie smoothly glides through 1970 Los Angeles in the wake of those societal changes and left this viewer who was not even alive back then, with a deep sense of regret. The atmosphere that ""Inherent Vice"" exudes is druggy, surreal and yet strangely tied to all the unanswered questions and real tragedies (Altamont, the Manson Murders etc.) that made the revolution come to a screeching halt. What was left were the drugs, some glorious memories but also a feeling of distance. As much as there was a sexual and intellectual liberation, it seems those thrill-seekers"" were unable to commit to something tangible. To commit wouldn't have been hip, and to be square meant to be dead. And by evoking such thoughts and emotions, the movie delves into something inherently human and therefore something truly precious.",Inherent Vice

For the first ten minutes of the film, it certainly appears that it is going to be a great film.But the plot just completely breaks down as the film goes on and stops making any sense at all.At some point the characters you're meeting (quirky and interesting as they are) no longer matter because the plot connecting them together in a significant way almost completely disappears.By the end I was confused about who half the people we met were or why they mattered at all to the story. Joaquin Pheonix and Josh Brolin were great, but overall this film was disappointing from a storytelling perspective.

Why make a movie this lacklustre? Perhaps I'm missing the point. Maybe Inherent Vice is actually some kind of subtlety-laced masterpiece of understated nuance and restraint, but to me it was unforgivably boring. I lasted until the scene at the massage parlour reception desk, which I can only describe as the most uncomfortably vacuous 3 minutes of cinema in living memory. How could anyone script that scene without immediately wanting to rip up and burn everything they've ever written? Terrible.As it happens, the recreation of 1970s post-hippie fallout America looked pretty spot on to me, but that counts for zero when you lend it to a movie that's about as entertaining as watching stick insects do tai chi.

147,temrok9,the hallucinatory lightness of being,10,3 March 2015,"Like Inside Llewyn Davis last year, Inherent vice is a movie I first approached with caution, finding it inferior to my expectations, but growing up inside me during watching it and after, to the extent of haunting me like no other film of this year, and making me want to go back and have another take on it.To begin with, I am not a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson.I didn't like There'll be blood and I didn't like The master;I am not a fan of Thomas Pynchon neither, since my readings of Gravity's rainbow, Against the day and Vineland were not rewarding(he lacked the genius of a David Foster Wallace).And when the movie started with a boring dialog, shot in close range, I said to myself it had been a mistake to go see that film..But soon I found myself dragged in a complex directory plan where the focus on faces created an effect of constant hallucinatory dimension, something unusual that has been tried, for example, in The Black swan, with fine results, but here the effect is so superb that almost counts as a breakthrough in aesthetics.So, this is a story of a certain period, and while the feeling of this period is masterfully recreated, the film stands far away from the typical historical references one would expect, and turns instead into an existential irony, inherent I suppose in the novel, that Anderson as a writer and director brilliantly understands and succeeds in building, through subtle-and new -ways.Altman would be proud of this movie(that won the Altman award this year).In the end, through the adventures of Mr. Phoenix(in his best role of his career, in my opinion), we reach a kind of knowledge regarding the state of things today;the state of an inner reality usually neglected in the name of the supposed- journalistic-real, also.We get lost in the final shot of an ambivalent will be, such as life really all the time is.I will even give Pynchon a second chance.A great movie that can easily be overlooked as boring if one does not get caught in the strange universe Anderson builds for us.About the hallucinatory lightness of being!",Inherent Vice

149,Matt-144-792009,"A Complex Crime Story, with a lot of in's, a lot of out's, a lot of what have you's.",6,16 December 2014,"In Inherent Vice, Joaquin Phoenix plays Doc Sportello a bumbling stoner/private detective who stumbles upon a complex case of attempted murder, sex, scandal, extortion, political corruption and drugs. The information is brought to him by his ex-old lady, Shasta played by Katherine Waterson, who later turns up missing. Also who in my opinion looks like a younger, hotter Melissa Leo. The story is based on a complex crime drama by author Thomas Pynchon. There are tons of characters, small plot lines and deep criminal under workings, yet we never seem to get deeper than the shallow level our baked protagonist and narrator are able to take us. This is director Paul Thomas Anderson working another complex ensemble cast, much like in Boogie Nights (1997) and Magnolia (1999). I am a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, have been since Hard Eight (1996). I think his films are better on repeat viewing. Yet I must admit Boogie Nights was entertaining on first viewing, Magnolia was great after the second and third viewing, others require a lot of patience. I was less than impressed with The Master (2012), acting was great, the story just seemed to wander aimlessly. Strong characters lacking direction. His characters all have so many quirks and bit part dialogue rants that just can't be appreciated on first viewing. Re-watch the pool party scene with John C. Riley and Mark Wahlberg from Boogie Nights. Or any of the late great Philip Seymore Hoffman and Julieann More in both Boogie Nights and Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson just knows how to get amazing performances out of actors. All that being said, Inherent Vice is a bit of a disappointment. I felt he wanted to do what the Cohen Brothers did with The Big Lebowski (1998), a stoner in over his head on a complex crime plot. Neo-noir story line, with sexy sirens, Nazis instead of Nihilists and a wise beyond the plot narrator. There are great supporting character performances, Josh Brolin as a hard edged police detective Big Foot is amazing. The subtlety of his comedic performance in the Japanese pancake house scene is hilarious. There is also a bit part with the great Martin Short. Picture a coked out Austin Powers, but I won't spoil it. Benicio Del Toro plays Doc's lawyer, who specializes in maritime law. I am reminded of his Dr. Gonzo in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). Owen Wilson's role in this film seems way under used and almost unnecessary; Reece Witherspoon also, very under used. There are all these great actors, yet not a lot is delivered with them. I assume there is a 5 hour directors cut on Blu-Ray to look forward to. All in all this film struggles to find its tone. It goes back and forth between bumbling comic irreverence to wanting to sober up and offer up a message. There is a not so subtle police brutality political subtext to this film. Doc is repeatedly knocked down, and beaten by Bigfoot and other LAPD. Bigfoot is a repressed angry narcissistic strait laced officer with a bit of a homo-erotic oral fixation. As if to explain the behavior of most violent police activity. I worry that the message kept the director PTA. preoccupied from doing what usually makes his films great. Too busy holding up a mirror to today's political and social unrest as a means of comparison with the late 60's. As in all of his movies the jury is still out until I have had a chance to re-watch it. But if you don't have the patience you might want to skip this one. This is more The Master than it is Boogie Nights.If you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",Inherent Vice

Joaquin Phoenix just surpassed Woody Harrelson as the king of weed. He smoked so much weed he must have opened a franchise in Colorado. How in the world did he retain any brain cells and remember anything in his investigation? with this film being exceedingly long and the dialogue mostly incoherent, Paul Anderson drags this thing along in a grueling pace. Is this a hallucination from someone's warped drug induced mind? How do you get that time back after watching this? This is California 1970 and there is only one black person in all of California and even his interaction is wasted in this film. Yeah, I get it suppose to be an artistic representation but the artist Paul Anderson, is painting everything gray over gray.

It didn't help that a lot of the dialogue is mumbled or slurred, deluging you with detail, or that in many scenes Anderson seems to have gone with the kind of deliberate kookiness to be found in many Coen Brothers films.That said, what Anderson brings out feels like a genuine weirdness from the '70s, and a Pynchonian connectedness between the seemingly contrary or random; a kind of head-on collision between conservative America and counter-culture which seems to define this decade.I was baffled and bored for much of the first 2 hours, but, like a Pynchon book, something told me to persevere and I was glad I did. There is a riveting scene and haunting performance from Katherine Waterston which starts to bring all of the plot strands together and what feels like a very glib exercise up to that point becomes real and gains dimension. From that point on, I was glad I stuck it out, even though I was gasping for a beer.The performances are hit and miss, Joaquín Phoenix is very good, and there are other good performances, but it's Katherine Waterston who runs away with the film (an achievement in a film that runs away with itself). Pynchon is very tricky to adapt and Hollywood mainstream is not its natural home, but I'm really glad Anderson did so, and this film has stayed with me.",Inherent Vice

But I do like a couple of his films a lot. Never a love but strong likes. I can appreciate really slow paced films but there has to be some point to the pace or something that builds. Inherent Vice is just slow, pointless, meandering and meaningless. The characters are unbelievably annoying and unnatural. Anderson even managed to make Joaquin Phoenix look like a terrible actor. I can't even describe how bad this film is. It screams of trying too hard while nor achieving anything at all. I think PTA fans are almost as bad as Tarantino fans, they like anything he makes just because he made it and can't bring themselves to criticize it.

A few of the scenes are, but far too many aren't sufficiently engaging. Half the scenes in this movie, right from the start, are highly skilled (the lighting, the acting, the composition), and otherwise wholly shruggable. There's plenty of brains and heart as the movie talks about squares vs subversives, or the abandoned values of the 60's being more human than the greed to follow, but if you've considered all this before, it might not add anything for you.It's skillfully made, smart, and challenging.

PTA got an Oscar nod for best screenplay with this one and although I love the man, I don't think it deserved it. Sure the mystery is very well wrapped up, but he could have done much better with the characters. At some moments the characters felt like Wes Anderson's characters.

This is not Taxi Driver, this is not Good Will Hunting, this is not any sort of intelligent.The knock on this film is the confusing, too many character, twisty turn plot. I would disagree. The movie has a heavy amount of hard-to-follow dialogue, yes. The film has a ridiculous amount of characters that contribute to the plot, sure. There is an infinitely confusing story ache that takes on a new rising action seemingly every 5 minutes. There are resolutions, more problems, conflicts, climaxes, and more conflicts all happening at once. The movie is, indeed jumbled up and a complete mess. Absolute train wreck. BUT, one film that I can remember being an absolute mess as well is The Usual Suspects. I'm sure pretty much everyone who ever watched that film was lost at one point, but the beauty of that film is how everything gets drawn together for a fitting ending. Inherent Vice had a mediocre blend of comedy and suspenseful mystery, that lead to an ultimately disappointing ending. Having sat through The Usual Suspects and been rewarded with a great ending, I endured the ever too lengthy runtime of Inherent Vice in hopes of a mind-blowing ending...and nothing. For a film that gets so jumbled, messy and twisty, there seems to be no over-arching resolution with a very weak ending. There was just too much going on and it seemed like the writers just needed to wrap it up after a couple hours.

161,eichler2,Lebowski gone wrong,3,15 January 2017,"While browsing the movies at a local library, this one jumped out at me - psychedelic looking cover, big list of name actors on the front, interesting and plot blurb on the back...so I took a chance. And ended up wasting two and half hours watching what looked like an attempt to do a prequel to The Big Lebowski that went wrong in every way possible.The film is based on a book, so I assume there was a plot buried in there somewhere under all the mumbled, slurred or whispered dialog, confusing and disconnected scenes that go nowhere and cardboard acting. The director must have realized that no one was going to be able to follow this, so he added a hippie astrologer chick as the narrator, but she's even more confusing and annoying than the movie she's trying to explain.From the start I couldn't tell what was going on, and every time I felt like I might be starting to understand a bit of it, the plot (such as it was) would veer off in a completely different direction. When the thing finally ended, I had no idea what happened, I was just glad it was over.It had something to do with a stoner detective named Doc living in the early 1970s. He gets tipped off about a missing millionaire real estate developer by his crazy ex-girlfriend. But then he is told about something called the ""Golden Fang"" by an Asian prostitute. But before he gets too deep into that, he is sidetracked by a supposedly dead jazz musician who turns out to be an unwilling FBI undercover agent. And there's a bitter police detective named Bigfoot who wants to be an actor and seems to get all his leads from Doc. None of this really adds up to a coherent story.I have to give the movie credit for using some interesting music in the soundtrack (Can's ""Vitamin C"", Neil Young's ""Journey Through the Past"", etc). Some of the performances are good like Josh Brolin as Bigfoot, and occasionally Joaquin Phoenix as Doc, when he's not mugging for the camera. There were a couple laughs, although most of the attempts at humor fall pretty flat.Overall recommendation: avoid. There are far better ways you could waste two and a half hours of your life.",Inherent Vice

But as of now... Although I gave it a low rating, it's not a total miss, and has some clever scenes/lines, but it is just a mish-mash of... I am not sure what. It had great potential and it did make me want to read the book; could Pynchon have started this possible debacle? Accurate if not over the top depiction of the early '70s, probably because Pynchon was actually there, and yeah, cops were almost that bad, or worse, but in real life ways, and I knew people who smoked pot 24/7 then, and it was accepted in some circles. Over the top in the stoner movie attempt/addition to the mish-mash. I mean, what are you trying to be, a stoner movie, a mystery movie, a noir, comedy, what??? Focus, PTA! I generally really like Joaquin Phoenix but he was too old for this role and I can't be too hard on him with this material to work with. Plus his makeup was really hard to look at (pot doesn't do that to you; either you have hygiene or not). The detective and the other men were pretty good, if not really over the top (I keep saying that, which shows how much it was over). Females were '70s chicks, and lots of them, and yeah, it was like that. Blonde, long, lithe, esp in Calif. But not much depth shown here, as in real life, then, alas. Thus, not much to say about their performances.There was a big disservice done to the music, with the exception of Neil Young's contributions. I didn't feel I was in 1970, music-wise, and that is a big part of an era, the screwing up of which really hurt this movie further.

Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love have quickly become classics. There Will Be Blood and The Master were also very good. Inherent Vice, um, not so much. I found this movie to be a major disappointment and a total bore-fest. The characters, other than Jeannie Berlin (who should have had more screen time) and Martin Short (who I normally can't stand,) were vanilla and shallow. The plot consisted of a pot-smoking, coke-sniffing loser who travels from scene to scene, encountering other pot-smoking, coke-sniffing losers - Joaquin Phoenix seemed right at home. I expected the soundtrack to be better considering the music of the era. Other than the two Neil Young songs, it was bland. The Oscar-nominated costumes were spot-on, though. To sum it all up, I would give this drug-glorifying, too long, self-important, boring mess a 4 out of 10 stars - and that's being generous.

Inherent Vice however is a sloppy mess of a film with a completely incoherent story that is confusing and convoluted throughout. Not to mention its totally uneventful. Nothing of importance ever really happens in this film and plenty goes unresolved. There are no well developed or interesting characters in the entire story, not even our main character ""Doc"" played by the incredible Joaquin Phoenix. He and the whole supporting cast do the best they can with what they are given, but that sadly is not much at all.It really doesn't feel like much effort is put into the production. Its almost as if you can tell the people involved were not feeling passionate about this project at all and who can blame them? Its really crap.At least with PTA's last film The Master it was very artistic which made up for its lack of a story. Here there isn't any artistic value at all.

In fact, I began to wonder if being high on weed was like watching this movie: understanding very little and stumbling from one place to another. The film was not a comedy as much as it was a satire. The humor will make you chuckle but never burst out laughing, and that is if the jokes don't fall flat. There were a few scenes that involved extremely uncomfortable sexual acts, all of which were stretched out too long. The plot seemed to just randomly move along from one event to another (possibly due to my confusion with the names of everybody). There were several subplots that popped into the story over time that did not seem to be very relevant.

You can give yourself a brain cramp trying to understand it, or maybe even find a class at your local community college that would attempt to explain the plot. Or you can do like I did, which was to just relax and go with the flow. About a third of the way through, I indeed made the command decision to quit trying to figure it out. I just went with the general theme of a comedic detective story with good guys, bad guys, and others straddling the line separating the two. The next day, I still don't understand the motives of (or even the need for) some of the characters, but I enjoyed the movie nonetheless. The movie was full of small gems. After being arrested, Doc the main character, was represented by a lawyer who specializes in maritime law, not criminal defense. The movie was full of oddball little bits like that. Each and every character was a joy to watch, even if a few of them confused me to no end. I'm not sure where he's been of late, but it was a joy to see Martin Short back on the big screen, even if for an all-too-brief role. Josh Brolin was pitch-perfect as a straight-laced civil-rights-stomping police detective. Joaquin Phoenix played his ""hippie scum"" role to perfection, too. Think of this movie more as a character study of a handful of eccentrics, instead of a typical flick with a no-nonsense plot. Although Inherent Vice isn't quite in the same league, it took me several viewings before I understood the plot of The Big Lebowski. So take that with a grain of salt. Just kick back, slip your brain clutch, and enjoy. And on rare occasions like this, smile and know an understandable plot is overrated.",Inherent Vice
167,jacco59,Overambitious,7,16 February 2015,"After two incredible masterpieces, ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""The Master"", I was awaiting whatever Paul Thomas Anderson would be doing next with baited breath. However, as it turns out, ""Inherent Vice"" is a bit of a let down. Based on high-brow literary author Thomas Pynchon's book of the same name, the film has an impressive cast and, as one would expect, interesting dialogue. However, the whole thing gets somewhat bogged down by an incomprehensible plot, and ends up feeling even longer than its already sizable 150-minute runtime would suggest. Perhaps this was just a case of overambition on Anderson's part, a skilled director adapting for the screen a novel whose themes and plot are simply too dense to translate into film. Despite all of this, your time will not be wasted on this film. But make sure you go into the theater fresh and pay good attention, otherwise you may just nod off (as my partner did).7/10PS: the film is narrated by my personal all-time favorite recording artist, Joanna Newsom, who also plays the minor roll of Sortilege. I urge everyone who reads this review to sample her music. It will improve your life.",Inherent Vice

169,sportello29,Inheret vice in a marine insurance policy is anything that you can't avoid.,9,15 February 2015,"Inheret vice in a marine insurance policy is anything that you can't avoid. Eggs break, chocolate melts, glass shatters. And Doc wondered what that meant when it applied to ex-old ladies.Inherent vice introduces us to drug-fueled, psychedelic, , ever-changing,70's LA and it's many interesting and interconnected characters. The movie has two main themes – the strange disappearance of Mickey Z. Wolfmann, the local real estate big shot, and the never-ending appearance and doings of a mysterious organization known as the golden fang. Now, the first theme has a direct relation to our antagonist, stoner detective Larry 'Doc' Sportello, who's ex-old lady Shasta, who was at that point Mickey's old-lady, had also disappeared. From this point on every new client that comes through Doc's door seems to be somehow connected to the Wolfmann case. Moreover many leads start to be associated with the golden fang, that nobody quite knows anything about. On top of that, Lt. Bigbfoot Bjornssen and the LAPD appear to have a strange stake in the case too.A nod to the dawn of the free spirited lifestyle of the 60's California, Inherent Vice is truly about something one can't avoid. For Doc it's Shasta Fay. With all of his stoner charm he acts as if in a dream, which always ends with Shasta. For Bigfoot it's the death of his partner and revenge. The renaissance detective has carefully navigated Doc in his own interest, starting from staging the disappearance of Mickey and ending with skillfully feeding Doc information about Prussia. For the golden fang – it's something that –they- can't avoid – dominance, with a subtle reference to the rise of big corporations in the 70's. The golden fang is a heroin cartel that takes things full cycle – they produce, transport (through their boat), distribute (Rudy Blatnoyd(s) and Puck Beaverton(s)), and their biggest front is the institution where such addicts (Coy Harlingten) get brainwashed (Japonica) and institutionalized before they can go out on the streets and score some more – the full cycle.The interesting part is to really think about what moves and motivates Doc. Is it Shasta? Is Doc just genuinely a good person? He ends up helping Coy and Hope in the end without keeping any money to himself, neither does he seems to be really angry at Bigfoot. And this is the beautiful mystery of Inherent Vice, it's none of these reasons, it's just the scene, something Doc can't avoid. Like in a spider web the series of events seem to suck Doc in before he even knows it. Most importantly Inherent Vice is about a gradual end of the free-spirited-piece-and-love era that were the 60's. Hippies are becoming increasingly more suspicious and the bureaucracy is slowly taking hold. Law enforcement are constantly thirsty for blood. We are allowed to witness this decline first-hand through a number of hilarious and vivid characters, Doc's doped out eyes and Newsom's cotton voice. With John Greenwood's remarkable, moody soundtrack, PTA beautifully guides us through this inevitable change, which no one can reinforce, much like Inherent Vice itself.",Inherent Vice
170,cuthbertjoel,"Long, Boring and Unfathomable",2,18 February 2015,"I'm not too sure how anyone could take anything away from this film.Firstly, there are far too many characters, all of whom are completely forgettable (with maybe the exception of the lead), their stories don't seem to weave together at all and you end up not caring at all about them.Consequently, the 'plot' is all over the place. I've now watched the film, had a couple of hours to consider it, and read the plot synopsis, and I still can't work out what actually happened. The story has more holes than a sieve.The feeble attempts at trying to summarise the 'plot' with a crap voice-over and a completely forgettable hippie girl occasionally chiming in with an 'intellectual' 5 minute rant just don't work.The one slight positive I can mention is Jaoquin Phoenix's performance was fairly decent and actually provided some sort of focus for the film, but this is all drowned out in a sea of needless characters, overly convoluted plot lines, loose ends that are forgotten about and just a general mess of a film.",Inherent Vice
171,pelhamc,The Big Lebowski meets Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,7,7 August 2016,"Inherent Vice is the auteur, Paul Thomas Anderson's film adaptation of the eponymous novel by Thomas Pynchon. It is a psychedelic, neo-noir, stoner mystery, with absurdist humor. This picture contains a star-studded cast.The talented Joaquin Phoenix stars as Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, a hapless hippie private detective on a mission to locate the lost love of his life: Shasta Fay Hepworth. Phoenix gives authenticity to the world he comes from, having grown up in Hollywood. Josh Brolin finally hams it up, playing with type as cop Christian ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen--a hippie's worst nightmare. The humorous dynamic between the two characters symbolizes the clash between the Nixon administration and the radical youth, playing out as a backdrop to the storytelling. The novel was about a place, Pynchon's ""Gordita Beach,"" supposedly based on real life Redondo Beach. The film is about a time, sending up the '60s the way Anderson satirized the '80s in Boogie Nights. Along the way, the detective encounters harebrained conspiracies and a cast of oddball characters. Owen Wilson is the natural choice for the surf rocker government mole character. The timeless Reese Withersppon is well cast as the Deputy District Attorney. I swear, somewhere there is a portrait of the woman aging horribly! Benecio Del Torro puts on a good performance as the dorky lawyer/sidekick.The book had a lot of characters and they tried to cram them into the feature. The result is a two and a half hour deconstructionist dreamscape with loose ends. It could have used some editing. The book had quirks which were included for their own sake, while losing sight of the plot. Key plot points were distilled into minimal exposition. It drags at times. There was a rare female narrator. Lavish cinematography, extended classic rock scores, and blending of scenes creates an almost ethereal effect. I found it entertaining. I recommend seeing Inherent Vice. Coen brothers fans will like this one.",Inherent Vice

173,peter-j-downey,A successful adaption.,9,12 February 2015,"Doc (Joaquin Phoenix), a hippie PI, has a case thrust upon him by his ex-lover, Shasta (Katherine Waterstone). Doc is asked to stop the plot to commit Mickey Wolfman, an eccentric real estate developer, to an insane asylum. As soon the plot starts to gain momentum it breaks down; Aryan Brotherhood, the Black Guerrilla family, a society of drug smuggling dentists, a Chinese drug syndicate, the FBI, cults, local politicians, prostitutes and a renegade cop all twist the narrative out of shape.Being familiar with the source material, this feels like as close you could get to a watchable adaption of a Thomas Pynchon novel. Pynchon subverts plot and structure in his novels; he presents the world as an absurdist mess, presenting stranger and stranger situations as his protagonists meanders to a conclusion that doesn't really matter. In these worlds Pynchon assaults his readers with symbolism trying to force meaning where there may be none; PT Anderson's script and direction adeptly translates this on to the big screen, and is probably why he has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.The sequence in the brothel shows the strength of Anderson's adaption; Doc is confronted by a prostitute who lists all of the specials that are available, another prostitute comes into the conversation and goes down on the first one. Doc wanders off into the brothel, is hit over the head, and falls to the ground Buster Keaton style. Moments later he awakes, beside a dead body, and surrounded by a battalion of police who shout insults at him through a megaphone. This is a jarring sequence of events; noir style conversation, sexual action, violent action, black screen cut, resting shot, cut to army of police, reaction shot. The dialogue suits the absurdity of the situation and Anderson's shooting and direction mould the scene to flow naturally, and Anderson manages to avoid abstraction allowing for to audience to take in everything, and he keeps this style throughout.Casting in the film is extensive, and suits to the collage tone of the film. Anderson employs Reese Witherspoon, Josh Brolin, Martin Shortt and other notable faces to create a sense of recognisable chaos. However the real strength of this film comes from the interplay between Brolin and Phoenix; their back and fourths elevates the dark humour to laugh out loud moments, and at times allow us to see the repressed emotions amongst the absurdity.All that said, this film isn't accessible, it is intentionally obscured in pacing, dialogue and plot; the reaction from a person behind me when the credits rolled was ""Sh*t"", several people also walked out during the film. I spent an hour or so trying to think of people I could recommend it to, and left empty handed. Also my housemate and I failed at discussing exactly what had happen in the film and why, and I think I will need to watch this film again to grasp what happened. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it.",Inherent Vice

And yet, there is no continuous story and while a director like Lynch can pull this off, Anderson fails. And it's not just the nonlinearity but the complete lack of any character development. I have never seen a movie where a private investigator does nothing, other than taking bizarre notes, that resembles the work of a detective. Or a policeman that acts randomly utterly violent without any cause or reason. To describe this movie I will use an analogy. Question: How many surrealist painters does it take to screw in a light bulb? Answer: Fish! Now, while this might pass as a joke, there is nothing funny about this movie. There is also nothing serious about this movie. It's not even entertaining. I deeply regret watching it.",Inherent Vice
175,andy-66447,"""Inherent Vice"" Is Rare Dud For Paul Thomas Anderson",3,24 August 2015,"Even the great Stanley Kubrick directed one dud – 1999's Eyes Wide Shut. Now it's Paul Thomas Anderson's turn. His latest, Inherent Vice is a mess. Anderson is currently, in my humble opinion, our greatest director. Not only have I liked every one of his films so far, four of them were my favorite pictures of their respective years – culminating in 2012's The Master, a tour-de-force for the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I was obviously intrigued and captivated about seeing Anderson's latest. And I couldn't be more disappointed.Based on Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel, Inherent Vice stars Joaquin Phoenix as a drugged-out hippy private investigator named Doc Sportello, asked by his on-again/off-again girlfriend to thwart a plot to send her wealthy real-estate mogul boyfriend to an insane asylum. In a seemingly unrelated case, a woman asks Doc to locate her missing sax-playing husband (Owen Wilson). The set-up sounds interesting. I was already thinking of a hippie-culture version of Chinatown. And who better to handle the methodic unraveling of a complex plot than Anderson. Boy was I wrong.The knock against The Master was that it lacked a coherent structure – that it didn't have enough plot. Again, I personally was not bothered by this format, but it annoyed some critics and viewers. Anderson must have been listening, because Inherent Vice suffers from too much plot. I realize this film is based on a novel, but had Anderson simply stuck to one or two story threads, it would have been easier to follow. This is 1970 Los Angeles, and Pynchon & Anderson hit us with everything – and I mean everything – we can imagine. Not long after the opening sequence, we're introduced to a radical Black Panther, then a Chinese brothel masquerading as a massage parlor, a drug-smuggling ring, a protest at a Richard Nixon speech, a Ouija board, a coke-snorting dentist, a Nazi supremacist, and a no-nonsense LAPD cop, played to the hilt by Josh Brolin. There's so much going on in this picture, you'll need to take notes and design a flow-chart just to keep everything straight.And the low-key acting doesn't help. Robert Altman was a master director of ""real life"" acting – where his actors didn't mug for the camera, had no big monologues, and didn't seem to realize they were even being filmed. I'm assuming that style was Anderson's goal here, but it doesn't work. Joaquin Phoenix, so forceful and dynamic as the neurotic World War II vet in The Master, mumbles his way through this material so dreadfully I wondered if he was even awake. I realize he's supposed to be a hippie, but even hippies rolled out of the proverbial bed once in a while. And I realize, Inherent Vice is a novel, but when a guy smokes as much weed as Doc, there's no way he could effectively function as a private investigator. Then again, after watching Inherent Vice I'm not sure he does effectively function as a private investigator. Doc reminds me somewhat of the title character in Barry Lyndon – he simply reacts to his surroundings, but rarely initiates any action on his own. Perhaps this material wasn't meant to be filmed.Katherine Waterston (daughter of Sam) plays Shasta Fay, Doc's sometimes girlfriend. Yes, she's a hippie too; and yes, she mumbles too – although, unlike Doc, she smiles often, and her hair is kempt. Benicio Del Toro is serviceable as Doc's attorney friend, and Reese Witherspoon is fine as the Deputy District Attorney, but Owen Wilson doesn't seem to know which direction is north, and Martin Short is embarrassingly unfunny as the coke-snorting dentist. The actor who makes the best showing here is Josh Brolin as Bigfoot Bjornsen, the hard-nosed LAPD cop. He's convincing, although we've seen him play this sort of character so many times now that his mere presence in this picture is somewhat underwhelming.Again, I wonder exactly why a great director would imagine that this material is worth filming in the first place. Not only are most of the characters incapable of comprising a coherent thought, but the screenplay itself is devoid of any coherent thoughts. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great director, making Inherent Vice all the more troubling. Anderson isn't some novice. I hope he's merely bit off more than he can chew. No crime there – I'd rather see a director overreach than under – but that doesn't make me ever want to see it again, nor recommend you do likewise.",Inherent Vice

177,peterfaure,"trippy and surreal, but not for everybody",8,13 February 2015,"Inherent Vice is an excellent movie, but it's not for everybody.It's based on a novel by Thomas Pynchon, a surreal American writer mainly inspired by the transition from the 60s to the 70s, and its repercussions throughout American society.As a result, it's a rather artsy movie, filled with interesting characters and driven by a pot-smoking PI played, wonderfully, by Joaquim Phoenix. There is a lot to like about it, from its interesting meditations on life to its cast of quirky, oddball characters, but it's not a Hollywood movie and it will disappoint anybody looking for glitzier productions filled with special effects or cheap drama.The plot itself, rather meandering and confusing, is rather irrelevant, but the movie as a whole is original and, if you can read between the lines, thought-provoking. Normally I would give it a higher score, but when I think of the novel it was based on I can't help thinking that the pace was a little too slow, and too many amazing moments in the novel were just trash-canned to keep the budget down.Still, very original and interesting, but be prepared for quite a trip (especially if you smoke a joint first, which would really help getting into the main character's shoes)peace",Inherent Vice

179,evanobrien100,A comedic melancholic mystery,8,10 January 2015,"To say that I have been looking forward to this movie for quite some time would be an understatement. Based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon ""Inherent Vice"" promises on face value promises to be a comedic madcap homage to classic film noir mysteries such as Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"", Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"", Joel and Ethan Coen's ""The Big Lebowski"" among others. There are elements of all of those films in IV yet it remains definitively a Paul Thomas Anderson film. In a veiled way it invokes the spirit Anderson's previous feature the infuriatingly impenetrable ""The Master"".What Inherent Vice does in a much more relatable way is capturing the passing of time through the eyes of its characters, like a torrent of sand passing through their fingers. The characters must deal with the implications of events that reopen old wounds that time has healed and sometime in the opposite direction. The inspired soundtrack also invokes these sentiments Neil Young's ""Journey Through the Past"" and Chuck Jackson's ""Any Day Now"".Joaquin Phoenix shows a significant amount of restraint playing stoner detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello. There is a point in the film where everything gets built up to the point where Doc needs one big whiteboard to properly piece together enormity of the difficulties he finds himself in, it was rather refreshing to see a movie be so self-conscious of its own perplexities, maybe a visual aid to some of the more befuddled members of the audience. In addition there is the ever expanding plot, featuring a cacophony of ludicrous situations. There are many setpieces and sequences with side splitting laugh out loud moments.The supporting cast are what really elevate the film, carrying it through its lengthy runtime. In particular Martin Short's suave, drug addict, money laundering dentist ""Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd"", Josh Brolin's square police Lieutenant ""Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen and Katherine Waterston as Doc's ex the seductive ""Shasta Fay Hepworth"".It feels like a hazy semi lucid trip, floating in and out of focus as the sixties end and the seventies begin. It's captured through the dusty melancholic cinematography of Robert Elswit, the result is something akin to what would play in a double feature alongside Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" of which this is demonstrably a heavy influence. It is almost certainly a film that was made to be not only portray the seventies but to be a movie that could nearly be transported back there also, if that was Anderson's intention with Inherent Vice he has truly succeeded. In terms of where this stands amongst PTA's more revered films, I don't see it reaching the heights of other entries in his back catalogue. Personally, I think this is some of the most unique, inspired and interesting work he's done. It's an entertaining journey, with a terrific protagonist, insane humour and outstanding performances. Finally, there is a stinging sense throughout the film of longing for a time in the past when the world wasn't constantly changing, you were surrounded by the same people, that you fit in.",Inherent Vice
180,brendan-821-654855,I lasted 39 minutes,4,30 December 2015,"I have enjoyed Paul Thomas Anderson's previous cinematic outings, but this one was a beautifully filmed incoherent mess that simply fails to engage the audience.Don't be fooled by the other reviews: this is NOT a companion film to The Big Lebowski, which, unlike this one, is actually a film that has a coherent and engaging narrative.It seems to me that the positive reviews of this movie are built on two problematic justifications:1. The drug taking element of the plot should be considered a justification for the confusing, uninteresting and incoherent way the film is put together.The problem is that this is not how filmmaking is meant to work - and movies like The Big Lebowski are testament to the fact that visual storytelling and narrative are not meant to go out the window just because drug taking is a major element of the plot.2. The suggestion that you need to read the novel the film is based on in order to understand the movie.Once again, that's not how filmmaking is meant to work.The film is meant to be an adaption of the book that is accessible, in a standalone fashion, to people who encounter the story solely through the medium of cinema.If your audience needs to do supplemental reading - in this case, the entire book the film is an adaptation of - then the filmmaker has failed at filmmaking 101, which is supposed to be about creating a cinematic version of the source material, not some sort of filmed addition to the original work that is incoherent as a standalone artwork.Just in case you're wondering, the reason I gave it 4 stars was because the cinematography here is up to Paul Thomas Anderson's usual high standards even if the storytelling isn't.",Inherent Vice
181,Hbarker-32233,The best Robert Altman movie not made by Altman himself,10,19 December 2016,"""Does it ever end, he wondered. Of course it does. It did."" – Thomas Pynchon, Inherent Vice.There's a lot swirling around in writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's hilarious, freewheeling adaptation of the allegedly un-adaptable Pynchon's 2009 psychedelic noir — maybe too much to absorb in a single viewing. But endings are important here, and I think the key to best appreciating this stubbornly singular entertainment is to view these characters as the last men on the field, still playing a game they're achingly slow to learn is already over.It's 1970 on California's sunny, fictional Gordita Beach, where the Summer of Love has since curdled into a post-Altamont, Manson-panicked nest of bad vibes. Pothead private eye Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) is aroused from his regular evening stupor by the unexpected arrival of his ""ex-old lady"" Shasta Fay Hepworth (Kathleen Waterston). She comes bearing bad news — ominous hints about a cockamamie scheme in the works to kidnap and defraud her new sugar daddy, notorious real estate mogul Mickey Wolfmann. (""He's technically Jewish but wants to be a Nazi,"" we're helpfully informed.) Involving a jealous wife, land grabs, black radicals and the Aryan Brotherhood, this is exactly the kind of case that go-along, get-along Doc shouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. But our lovelorn detective never did quite get over Shasta, and so the affable stoner finds himself ambling around the underworld, pulling on random threads until a massive, byzantine conspiracy unravels faster than Doc's dope-addled brain (and his ""city dump of a memory"") can possibly process all the revelations.The plot against Mickey Wolfmann mushrooms ever outward to include a sad-eyed saxophone player (Owen Wilson) on the lam after working as an undercover agitator infiltrating subversive grass-roots organizations, nose-picking FBI agents bearing the Book of Mormon and even a sinister consortium of depraved, heroin-smuggling dentists calling themselves The Golden Fang.Narrated by Doc's sprightly assistant Sortilege (Joanna Newsom) –who after seeing the film three times now I'm still not sure isn't just a figment of his imagination– Inherent Vice drifts in a delirious haze, positioning Phoenix's groovy P.I. in a series of duets with a dazzling array of Special Guest Stars spinning patented Pynchon wordplay.We've seen films about zonked protagonists before, but in the case of Inherent Vice it's the movie itself that feels stoned. Phoenix tends to hang half-a-beat behind his co-stars, while Anderson eschews the swaggering filmmaking flourishes that made his reputation in favor of impeccably blocked static shots and long, lingering close-ups. (Most of the sight gags are simple edits quite belatedly revealing these characters' relationship to their surroundings.) Period pop songs flare up for a moment or two on the soundtrack and then snake their way through subsequent scenes at a lower volume before imperceptibly fading into silence. Everything here is ephemeral — emotional beats and plot points slipping in and out of focus — thematically matching a tale in which resolutions remain tantalizingly out of reach.Though still secretly pining for Shasta, Sportello's got a little thing going downtown with an uptight Deputy District Attorney (Reese Witherspoon) who likes to get freaky with dirty hippies. When he registers surprise at the casual corruption around her office, she shuts down their Walk The Line reunion with a classically Witherspoon-onian snarl: ""Grow up."" Breaking with the tradition of cynical, insouciant detectives from Sam Spade to The Dude, Doc's a genuine innocent, regarding this fallen world with disappointment and more than a little confusion — like when he flashes a peace sign to a Girl Scout who responds with an upraised middle finger. No way our floppy Phoenix seems capable of handling ""dead dentists on trampolines,"" or even worse, the sexually charged head-games being played here by his ex-old lady.But Doc's got an unlikely ally in LAPD Lieutenant Detective Christian ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen, played with bullet-headed brio by Josh Brolin in the performance of his career. Wearing a skinny tie and a ""flat-top of Flintstone proportions,"" Bigfoot bulldozes his way through scenes, his features balled up like a fist. A sadist with a penchant for civil rights violations and fellating chocolate-covered frozen bananas, he's the frustrated face of the Silent Majority, longing for a career in showbiz while taking out his aggressions on Sportello, his favorite punching bag.The relationship between Doc and Bigfoot lends a surprising amount of soul to these madcap proceedings, with the latter emerging as something of a tragic figure. Unlike his hippy-dippy secret sharer, Bjornsen bought into the Straight World's bill of goods and discovered all his hard work and loyalty don't mean a thing to the crooked powers that be. Buried in therapy bills and berated by a wife whose head remains amusingly cropped out of frame like one of Charlie Brown's teachers, Bigfoot comes to the sorry realization that unwashed Doc might be the only friend he's got.There's a melancholy undercurrent gathering force as the movie sidewinds its way through the convoluted mystery. Inherent Vice has more in common with Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas than just an attorney played by Benicio Del Toro. They're both about the death of a certain dream of the 1960's — about waking up one morning with a horrible hangover in Richard Nixon's America.Late in the game Anderson drops a hauntingly romantic flashback, rather unsubtly set to Neil Young's ""Journey Through The Past."" But it ends as abruptly as it began, revealing that the empty field where Doc and Shasta once kissed in the rain has now been filled by the ghastly corporate offices of The Golden Fang. They paved paradise, put up a parking lot and the bad guys bought it all while nobody was paying attention.",Inherent Vice

185,priyadarshanmaity98,Inherent vice...,9,4 May 2020,"Inherent vice is a blackly comic, engaging whodunnit with a game talented cast and a superb central performance makes this movie a must watch. To summarise the plot will be an understatement cause the basic story line in incomprehensible and its very hard to decipher . But still the movie works cause the details and the ambiguous symbolism holds you till the end. The cinematography and editing really makes us feel that we are in the 60s and 70s world. The grainy aesthetic is the cherry on the cake. The plot while inaccessible still has a immense level of intricate details that will melt your brain. Is it a normal disaaperance case or a bigger conspiracy about drugs, capitalist illegal houses business, about racism or about hippe culture. It is a culmination of all the themes and that is astounding to watch it is not easy follow but still you are hooked like you are solving the puzzle. Joaquin phoenix nailed the hippie aesthetic of the character, and you feel like he is actually a stoner masterfull performance. Josh brolin is weirdly funny. Benicio del toro, Reese Witherspoon, katherine waterston, Owen Wilson each and every person drives the plot together. Ultimately it is a headsmacking film but a sometimes not knowing anything is actually the biggest hint of the movies we watch. Paul Thomas Anderson nailed another film.",Inherent Vice
186,Discogodfather9622,I like the trailer better.,5,11 January 2015,"I'm not angry, Paul Thomas Anderson, (Boogie Nights) I'm just disappointed. I guess I have myself to blame for putting you on a pedestal for so long, talking you up to all my friends and loving everything you've done. I knew eventually that there would be a swing and a miss this is it. Inherent Vice, adapted from the book of the same name tells the story of Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) a private investigator and full time pothead who takes a job where he helps prevent a wealthy real-estate developer from being committed to an insane asylum by his scheming wife. The movie was an overlong, confusing and mostly boring mess. One of the drawbacks was the fact that you need to watch every second so you're not completely lost. New characters are being introduced every 15 minutes to further complicate the plot. If you have to go to the bathroom, good luck keeping up with it. The lengthiness makes it all the more frustrating considering the movie is 2 and half hours. With an all-star cast that includes Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon and Benicio del Toro, I was expecting something better that the excellent trailer didn't live up to.",Inherent Vice
187,JasonKleeberg,"Under the paving stones, the beach!",6,19 January 2015,"""Eggs break, chocolate melts.""I've been a Paul Thomas Anderson fan for a very long time, and I stand behind my opinion that he is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. His films always have amazing production value and fantastic casts. I've seen everything he's directed (with the exception of his short, Cigarettes & Coffee, which has proved to be pretty difficult to find), and although I don't like all of his movies (Magnolia, in particular), movies like Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love remain some of my favorite films of all time.Inherent Vice follows the story of a pothead P.I. named Doc Sportello, who traverses 1970's Los Angeles while searching for an old flame. It's an adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name, the first Pynchon novel to make it to the big screen. The recently revived Joaquin Phoenix plays Portello, and he's joined by an amazing cast - Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Benecio Del Toro, Katherine Waterson and Reese Witherspoon all show up at various points.In my opinion, Inherent Vice suffers from the same problem Anderson's last film, The Master, ran into - the parts are greater than the sum. Phoenix, who was also in The Master, clearly carries this film. His performance as Doc Sportello is hilarious as he dons costumes and trades barbs with Josh Brolin's 'Bigfoot', the other acting highlight here. Brolin steals the show in every scene he's in, eating food and kicking down doors. Unfortunately, the story our characters are wrapped up in is a bit convoluted and very, very long. In fact, I wasn't real interested in the story at all, and when it was all wrapped up, the only thing I really cared about was the performances by the actors...the same feeling I had when the credits rolled on The Master. Also, like all Anderson films, Inherent Vice is long - clocking in at two and a half hours.There are some very funny lines in Inherent Vice, and the 70's atmosphere is presented fantastically, but it just didn't stick with me like I hoped it would. Maybe it deserves a second viewing sometime.My final score: C+",Inherent Vice
188,luceruc,Basically a Masterpiece,10,30 March 2020,"Watched this yesterday, not out of choice, but because another member of our small but perfectly formed COVID 19 self-isolation team called his right to choose a film. I get a little nervous at the mention of Paul Thomas Anderson's name (entirely down to my unforgivable tendency to confuse him with another, rather more pretentious/ less interesting Anderson), but the minute the film opened on that narrow passage in between two beach houses, I was whoosh! - meaning hooked. This is a film where story doesn't really matter, and yet the narrative still so seamlessly, mesmerisingly exist you could just sit there and ride that wave till cows come home or Doc finally solves the case. Which case, you ask... So, then, congratulations to Paul Thomas Anderson for his entirely unexpected contribution to my Top 10 films ever. All is forgiven, and I hope it's mutual.",Inherent Vice
189,mattwilde123,Inherent Vice,7,6 March 2017,"'Inherent Vice' is the next feature film from Paul Thomas Anderson and you can tell. It boasts a great soundtrack, brilliant acting and a very convoluted story as it tells the story of a private detective (Phoenix) as he investigates into the disappearance of a former girlfriend.The screenplay is very confusing. It is hard to follow and purposely so as it introduces many characters and multiple stories but I have heard that this aspect of the screenplay is very true to the original source material. All I could do was admit that the film was too bewildering and to enjoy the many jokes and humorous situations.Joaquin Phoenix is tremendous as the main character Larry ""Doc"" Sportello. He is complimented with a great supporting cast such as Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.Overall, 'Inherent Vice' is not a typical popcorn flick and I was very confused by the overwhelming plot but it is fun and very well made and so I have given it a final rating of 3.5 stars.",Inherent Vice
190,notafanof,Gets better with subsequent viewings,8,8 May 2016,"At first viewing this film seemed incoherent and obtuse and played out like a stoner's attempt at making a noir film. Which is understandable,as it's obvious that is exactly what Paul Thomas Anderson was attempting with this adaption of the equally strange Thomas Pynchon novel. I admit I had mixed feelings after seeing this movie for the first time. It felt too long and up its own ass,and yet something kept drawing me back to the film's strange atmosphere which helped me realize its nuances after seeing it a second and third time. The film has a strange and dark sense of humour that won't register on the first viewing but will have the viewer guffawing by the second and third. This film has some brilliant and hilarious writing in it (obviously aided by Thomas Pynchon's nose for the absurd) that definitely stuck with me. The story is somewhat obscure and gets confusing which will certainly turn some viewers off. I definitely feel the runtime of this movie is its greatest flaw as a lot of the scenes are left to brew seemingly for the viewer to realize the absurdity of it seconds after it ends. But the memory can fleet, and the mind can become numb when scene after scene gives off an almost hypnotic sense of the surreal. Which is why the film won't register well with first time viewers. I implore folks to give this movie more than one chance, as after more subsequent viewings I can see myself declaring this film a masterpiece of the absurd. A high 8 out of ten rating that I consider subject to change as I love this film more and more after each viewing.",Inherent Vice
191,dangent280,1970: A Drug Odyssey,7,11 February 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson films in general, so far, have been films that I haven't really warmed to. I didn't really dig Magnolia and I couldn't stand The Master, so with this in mind, my expectation level going into Inherent Vice was rather flat. After watching it though, it's safe to say Inherent Vice is probably my favourite Anderson film to date, which in itself is faint praise due to my distaste for his earlier material. The film focuses on Joaquin Phoenix's, private investigator Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, and his plot to help his ex-girlfriend have her wealthy boyfriend Mickey Wolfmann committed to an insane asylum, yet that's as clear as the film's plot gets, with its' two and a half hour run- time being full of ambiguity and a distinct haziness which clearly attempts to parallel the drug-infested era of the early 1970's. The challenging nature of the film will definitely not be for everyone, particularly those who depend on a film's narrative being explained to the last detail, yet it's lack of explanation adds a strange layer of mystery, which in itself is rather compelling. Inherent Vice is full of solid acting, strong comedic moments, and a plot so out-of-control, it ends up being both painful and fascinating, Its' run-time is way too long, and the film suffers as a result, as many times I began to lose patience and checked how long we had left. Like I said, Inherent Vice is my favourite Anderson film to date, and it makes me want to watch his previous efforts again to see if it was just me and not the films themselves. Peace Out.Overall Score: 7/10",Inherent Vice
192,FilmFestAsh,"Complex, yet easily followed and stylishly substantial",8,7 August 2019,"Joaquin Phoenix emerges from his professional hiatus in this groovy drug-fuelled crime caper by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, There Will be Blood).Unconventional private investigator 'Doc' (Phoenix) is dragged into a sordid kidnapping and extortion plot via a soft spot for his troubled ex-girlfriend. Doc's well-placed friends in marine law (fantastic cameo by Benicio del Toro) and the district attorney's office (a surprising appearance by Reese Witherspoon) get him out of some sticky spots and help piece together what's up with his ex's boyfriend, his wife and her lover.Yet another A-list bit-part went to Owen Wilson as the 'disappeared' husband of an old friend whose fate inadvertently helps to reveal the double, triple and quadruple crossing at the highest levels in 1970's California, but it turns out Doc is more connected than he imagined and may know more than he thought.Narrated from on high by a celestially connected mutual friend of Doc and his lost soulmate, Inherent Vice takes you on a neon-lit psychedelic ride, leaving you at once wondering if you understood anything at all yet feeling as though everything played out as it should have.
It's complex yet easily followed and stylishly substantial.

193,SConIrish,There are many pleasures to be found in this dreamlike evocation of L.A.'s south-side in the seventies.,8,24 March 2015,"'I need your help Doc'Arguably the best director of his generation, Anderson's latest film arrives in cinemas with high expectations, this is his seventh feature and he has an impressive track record, including The Master, There Will Be Blood, Magnolia and Boogie Nights. Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye is an inspiration like that pic this one has a rambling narrative that keeps on leading the audience down rabbit holes. An audience looking for a satisfying conclusion to the mystery will be sadly disappointed however if you engage in the sprawling story, full of the odd and unusual there is much to enjoy. Anderson's films often require multiple viewings to appreciate the craftwork involved, Inherent Vice an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel is no different.PI, Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), spends most of the two hour running time high smoking weed and shuffling from one incident to another. His ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston), appears from out of the past to ask him to investigate the disappearance of her current boyfriend Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts). Real estate deals, the arian brotherhood, bikers, murder, kidnapping, cults, drugs, corruption and a mysterious cartel named the Golden Fang add to the growing complications of the meandering plot. Apart from the weed, Doc spends much of the film verbally and physically sparring with his nemesis come 'bro' Detective ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin). It is all together hypnotic and transfixing and the cast is in glorious form. From Phoenix as Doc, the part fits like a glove, to Del Toro as a nautical lawyer. Memorable moments include a visit to a cocaine addled dentist played to the hilt by Martin Short, a visit to an Asian massage parlour that offers special discounts to cops, and Brolin sucking on a banana stick as if, well you do the math on that one. There are many pleasures to be found in this dreamlike evocation of L.A.'s south-side in the seventies. Doc and Big foot are men out of sync with the world around them. Doc because he still seems to be addicted to a drug fueled free wheeling haze of the sixties, Big Foot seems aligned to the conservatism of the 1950s before corruption engulfed the world around him. The film is less interested in tying up the mystery than in celebrating absurdity and the text. Superb Production Design from David Crank and Cinematography from vet Robert Elswit are a highlight. Jonny Greenwood provides the score and Neil Young features on the soundtrack.",Inherent Vice
194,amanmsp,Its impossible to criticize this movie,5,28 October 2019,"We can't criticize the incomprehensible nature of the movie because it was intentionally written that way to capture the tone of the novel. Eventhough I personally couldn't enjoy this movie, I completely understand why other people like it. I understand what they were going for but I couldn't connect with it personally. All the performances, especially by Phoenix and Brolin were top notch. Both those characters were written extremely well. There were some genuinely funny sequences too. However there are several instances where Doc relies on coincidences and conveniences to uncover the cases. This aspect felt like lazy writing.
I don't dislike this movie but I can't like it either. I have such a complicated opinion on this movie. PTA is one of the best directors working today. But I couldn't appreciate this movie like I did with his other movies like The Master, There will be blood etc.",Inherent Vice

198,jmcgil22,Cannot Believe This Was Ever Released!,1,15 January 2015,"This film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Thomas Pynchon. I admit that I have never read the book, but I can tell you that the film is so bad I actually wondered if director Paul Thomas Anderson was playing a joke on the audience! First off, the film is slow-moving and boring. Even with an impressive cast (Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Benicio Del Toro and Martin Short) the performances are lackluster due to poor character development and sleep-inducing dialogue. Not to mention, there are way too many times in the film where the actors are whispering or speaking under the breath. There is absolutely no need for this, and it makes many of the conversations difficult to follow.The plot line is also lacking, which adds to the slow pace of the film. You continue to get the impression that the story is weaving a complicated tale of intrigue and suspense, with many interesting characters contributing. Sadly, nothing ever materializes. In fact, some of the characters that you think might pop up later are never seen again, leaving you wondering why they were ever introduced in the first place! Another head-scratcher is why Anderson chose to use harsh, unflattering lighting throughout the film. It shows every flaw and makes the actors look tired and ugly. The only time he changes to ""regular"" film lighting is at the very end. Perhaps there is a reason for this and I just didn't catch it (like in Seven where the weather is dark and rainy the entire time until the end when he is enlightened and it is flooded with sunlight). Or perhaps he was trying to capture an authentic 70's feel,but unfortunately it comes off as either a mistake or the result of a terribly low budget.If you smoke a lot of pot, you might enjoy this film but I'm not even sure. I think the book just didn't translate well into film format, or perhaps they simply had to leave out too many parts of the book to make the film worthwhile. In any case, I would say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen!",Inherent Vice
199,santosheflu,Too much patience and too much energy spent,5,4 April 2015,"I managed to watch this movie after spending a lot of energy connecting the scattered threads spread across the movie. The narrative, which is expected to make the movie interesting, is a little too disjointed. I felt it could have been woven in a tighter way. The fun of watching Doc (the protagonist) performing his 'hippy' things is hindered a lot by the background commentary and the compulsory connections a viewer may have to make. The pace is not really fast. So one can obviously do that. But the energy and patience one needs will take away the pleasure of movie-watching. I would not recommend it to you if you are into fast-paced gripping thrillers. This is for less-than-Lock Stock fans. If you are alone and have nothing better to do. Give it a shot or skip it. You won't miss anything.",Inherent Vice
200,flinched,Dazed and Really Confused,4,10 January 2015,"Break out a pen and paper cause so much is going on it's hard to follow watching this for the first time. So many characters, so many plots surrounding sub-plots surrounding plots, you could easily lose your place if your attention wavers in the slightest. I felt like I needed to make an outline to make sense of it all. The movie is very hard to follow and needs a second viewing to fully grasp the whole thing.My first impression is much like Joaquin Phoenix's character, a hazy pot soaked mind looking for a murderer with Bigfoot's help. No, no, he's looking for someone who was kidnapped by the Golden Fang Consortium of Nazi Heroin Smugglers led by dentist cokehead Martin Short. Or was he looking for Bigfoot's partner Littlefoot? I don't know nor do I care. One scene seemingly does not follow from the next and the whole movie became a big jumble I had no interest in solving.All I have left in my brain are foggy recollections of details to what felt like an infinity of plots and characters. While some scenes have 'A Big Lebowski' vibe to them and were entertaining, they're sadly not enough to make me sit through this a second time. And I'm afraid without that second viewing, I'll have to live with just a brief glimpse of what might or might not be a good film. But if you have the 2h:22m to do it all again, muster up some patience, make a pot of coffee, and take good notes (some help at 1h25m).

201,mrpinbert,"Confusing plot, still worth a watch.",7,12 March 2015,"I was looking forward to watching this because I have not seen a Paul Thomas Anderson movie yet. I am not disappointed but I was leaving the theater somewhat conflicted.On the one hand the movie contained allot of separate scenes that I really enjoyed, the cast was strong and it had really good cinematography and contained some memorable shots. But like I said, when I was leaving the theater I left conflicted. The main reason being that the plot was confusing and felt disjointed. Only by really paying attention could I make some sense of it and I am still not sure if I completely understood what went down.I feel like the plot being confusing might have been, at least in part, intentional since it really in a way enhances the atmosphere of the film. I left the theater feeling like I had just hung out with my friends and smoked a little too much pot in a short period of time.Another point that I am conflicted about is the use of the narrator. Which I feel could have been used more effectively. There is one particular instances near the beginning of the film where I was really annoyed by the use of the narrator. It was a scene I believe with Shasta and Doc on the beach. I was really enjoying watching the scene play out between the two characters when suddenly the narrator had to chime in and kind of ruined the mood for me. It really irked me how the narrator disrupted that scene to be honest.The first thing I noted about the story itself as I left the theater is that I didn't really think it was interesting and that it didn't excite me. But the more I let the movie sink into my mind, the more I realized that there was interesting stuff being told, just in a very relaxed and nonchalant way.Overall I think I might enjoy it more with a second viewing, to let the atmosphere and story really sink in and focus less on the plot.",Inherent Vice
202,ezr2061,"It's a Freaky, Groovy Trip, Man.",8,22 January 2015,"There's an old cliché often repeated when people are discussing the late 60s and early 70s which declares that if you can remember it then you weren't really there, ""there"" being a figurative term for the mental space occupied by the drugged, stoned, tuned in dropped out generation of free loving, free thinking hippies, protesters, radicals, and assorted social misfits who were aggressively or passively challenging traditional norms of thought and behavior. If you were sober enough to retain clear, coherent, intelligible recollections of events, well, you obviously didn't participate enough to qualify as a valid spokesperson for the counterculture. Talk about a paradox.And this is the guiding principle by which this film negotiates a much hyped and mythologized time in American history, when concepts such as reality and truth were being tested in new and novel and often fashionable ways. The hippest, grooviest, most out their mind thinkers were grasping at the most ephemeral, fleeting wisps of rationality in their attempts to contrive a more genuine, real ethos than the shallow materialistic one espoused by their disingenuous, hypocritical parents. Younger people were very aggressively and creatively testing the bounds and the integrity of mainstream society, much to the dismay and terror of older folks. It was a very intense, weird, wild time psychologically, and the profound disruptions to the social consciousness were being reflected in challenging and disturbing new forms of art. Performance Art today is understood to mean any human behavior which might attract other people's attention and perhaps confuses or threatens them but is actually just a theatrical stunt; like Jack Ass but without the actual violent kicks to the groin. But in the 60s performance art more often meant creative acts which included the audience or which benignly challenged them to engage with the action of the performance. It was an exciting, fun, sometimes scary method for artists to directly connect with an audience, often in unexpected ways such as improvised dancing and singing, or more dramatically with moments of seemingly real drama, such as an actor planted in the audience disrupting the proceedings with unusual or inappropriate behavior. The action was being brought directly to the audience intimately and personally. All barriers between the artists and the audience were being torn down in a symbolic pantomime of the radical changes of which they were dreaming for the larger society. Likewise, cinema in the 60s into the 70s experienced a phase of unprecedented freedom, experimentation and variety, and the general public were surprisingly receptive to so many of the odd, offbeat, confrontational films. Think about Easy Rider where the protagonists exist on the margins of normal mainstream society and whose hedonistic, self indulgent but benign behavior is extremely threatening to the straight society. The two modern day cowboys weren't living for anyone else but themselves, but their unconventional identities marked them as soldiers on the front lines of the generational war.In the archly mythical Western films of the 40s and 50s the brave, valiant heroes always prevailed, but in the new age of insidious conformity they are shotgunned to death in a sudden act of utter depravity. The immaculate, pure America so passionately championed in the pages of countless history and story books was now seen to be the home of so much grotesquely repulsive ignorance. The USA was less a melting pot of disparate cultures peaceably coexisting and more so a scorching cauldron of seething bigotry, racism, misogyny and paranoia. All this is reflected—obliquely and stylistically—in Inherent Vice, and especially in Joaquin Phoenix's layered and nuanced performance. His undeniably fascinating and sometimes frustrating portrayal of a man unwittingly caught in the fierce pincers of colliding social forces very effectively conveys the intense sense of doubt and uncertainty which pulsed just beneath the surface of everyday life. If the nightly news broadcast wasn't terrifying you in near real time with graphic images of the horrific carnage in Viet Nam half a world away then perhaps the recurring spectacle of cities in flames as disenfranchised, oppressed, enraged citizens rioted, maybe in your own town, just down the street; perhaps that kept you second guessing everything you ever learned and everything your leaders were telling you? The revolution was occurring on all fronts, externally and internally.These are the psychic forces which are acting upon director P. T. Anderson as he labors to elicit from his audience a response possibly similar to that experienced by someone under the influence of an illicit substance, as though his cinematic creation—his oddly compelling visuals and offbeat, syncopated narrative—are themselves hallucinogenic, narcotic agents. He wants to lull us into a sympathetic state of deep, profound uncertainty where we then might hopefully, possibly experience something not unlike a mind blowing revelation about the true nature of reality. That's the grand, nearly impossible mission of this film, and in an often impressive and entertaining way it succeeds. There are so many moments in this wonderful film which exist as entirely abstract, ineffable questions brushing up against the dark mysteries lying at the weird, wild heart of our ever bewildering reality. Inherent Vice is a real head trip, man.",Inherent Vice
203,Baker0927,Every Director Has Their Turkey,1,21 January 2015,"I saw this movie at the cinemas because it looked like an interesting detective mystery with old fashioned noir roots and intertwining plots and characters. These sort of films are among my favorite and it doesn't hurt that I am a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson to begin with. I personally look at him as being one of the more exemplary filmmakers of his time with classics such as Boogie Nights and Magnolia. His style is much like Scorsese's and his execution reminds me of Kubrick in many ways, cementing him in Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with. So you can imagine my disappointment when this film nearly bored me into a coma.This film was so bad, that I not only walked out on it- reflecting on how I could have spent ten bucks on such drivel- but also wept at having wasted nearly 100 minutes of my life on absolute trash. Yes, that is right...100 minutes and this film seemed like it wasn't anywhere near the finish line. Just scene after scene after scene of some of the most boring, expository dialogue ever delivered by a million characters who have nothing to do with anything but talk about a plot that would require the viewer to trip out on DMT to even understand it. The structure makes no sense, the constant reminder that our main protagonist ""Doc"", a whacked out PI who never showers, is just a second rate version of ""The Dude"" from The Big Lebowski becomes very tedious, and that voice-over....why? And I thought Blake Lively's voice-over in ""Savages"" was bad. The voice-over in this movie did absolutely nothing for the meandering plot. It was nothing but a bunch of incoherent, pseudo- intellectual ramblings by a stoner hippie girl that grates your ears worse than a cheese grater. I always thought a voice-over should serve as sort of the icing on the cake. It should only accent the story, but with the viewer still able to comprehend what is going on even without it. If you want examples, watch any film by Scorsese. That's how you do it. This movie was just a train wreck. A 7.3 rating? I am still wondering how anyone who wasn't a doper of the 70s could call this an ""entertaining movie"". The only decent thing in this waste of celluloid is Josh Brolin's performance as the banana loving, wise cracking detective named Big Foot. However, one performance cannot save a pointless, never-ending drug fueled mess of a film.Unfortunately Paul, you struck out this time. Absolutely terrible.",Inherent Vice
204,stickbob123,"Sun, Sand, and Psychedelia in Inherent Vice",10,10 December 2014,"Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, an unorthodox private-eye (Joaquin Phoenix) smokes a joint in his California shore-house--the waves on one side, and a whole mess of bad vibes on the other. Then in walks his ex-old lady, Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston), brining some of those bad vibes with her. She's with a married man now, Mickey Wolfmann, and his wife wants her help to make off with his money and get him sent to a loony-bin. Through a cloud of marijuana smoke, Doc barely manages to mumble, ""I think I've heard of that happening once or twice."" Agreed, Doc, that does seem pretty predictable. But then Wolfmann disappears and so does Shasta and the body count begins to climb. What follows is one of the most unique and unexpected trips of 2014. Inherent Vice throws the audience into the year 1970. Everyone wants to just smoke a joint and love each other, but they can't seem to stop the wave of paranoia that's overtaking them. As Doc delves deeper into the seemingly infinite mystery that unravels, neither he nor the audience is ever sure who to trust. One of these beautifully morally ambiguous characters is Lt. Det. Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), who gets plenty of screen-time and spends most of it eating frozen bananas and railing against hippies. Brolin and Phoenix's on-screen chemistry is off the charts, and the complicated relationship between their characters is explored through scenes of extreme hilarity. At the same time that I was questioning Bigfoot's moral compass and how dedicated he really is to justice, I was watching the screen through a filter of tears from laughter. Many have been calling Inherent Vice a combination of Chinatown and The Big Lebowski, and that's a pretty accurate description. It blends the beautiful look and complicated plot of neo-noir films with an almost surreal kind of stoner-comedy and it meshes perfectly. It also pulls from retro-noir films like Sunset Blvd. and utilizes a large deal of narration. Noir films usually blend exposition with character development in their narration--The male protagonist narrates and his beautifully crafted sentences highlight how tough he is and how fed up with everything he's become--but Inherent Vice takes a different route entirely. Sortilège (Joanna Newsom) narrates and exposition comes packaged together with an almost sentimental poetry that adds a layer to the loving, yet distrustful view of the Californian landscape. Sortilège is a highly mysterious character that takes a lot of the narration verbatim from the novel by Thomas Pynchon that this film is based on. She's a seemingly omniscient, psychedelic chick who navigates the screen on a physical plane, but also enters and leaves Doc's mind through voice-over when she sees fit. Paul Thomas Anderson directs and this is another movie to add to his seemingly air-tight repertoire (Boogie Nights, There Will be Blood, Magnolia). He lets the actors navigate the screen with minimum editing and allows entire dialogue scenes happen in one take. This is a risky move-- cutting is usually used to increase humor or add suspense, but somehow this movie manages without it. I can't stress enough how humorous Doc's interactions with other characters are. And the more tense scenes thrust Doc into danger with little to no warning and effectively get the heart racing. I'm sure a lot of people will complain about the complexity of the plot in this one. As Doc makes his way through a haze of pot smoke, conspiracies, and government corruption more and more names are dropped and exactly what's going and on and who's pulling the strings becomes almost impossible to make out upon first viewing. This is because plot takes the backseat to the film's powerful entertainment value and its themes. When I watched it for the first time, I honestly didn't know what was happening after the half-way point, but I barely had time to think about it because I was so engrossed by the little episodes that the movie presents. One of my favorite scenes features Doc and Shasta in a flashback as they run through the rain with Neil Young's ""Journey Through the Past"" playing in the background. The music takes priority over the dialogue and I wanted to weep for this beautiful moment that was now lost in the ""city dump"" of Doc's memory. It cuts to Doc navigating the same area in present day and the vacant lot that him and Shasta had been running freely through has now been occupied by a building shaped like a Golden Fang--a symbol of the criminal organization that plagues the characters throughout their journeys.And that, to me, is what the movie is all about. The simplicity of blissful ignorance being slowly replaced with growing knowledge of the darker side of the American dream. 1970 is the perfect year for this drama to unfold--characters can't stop talking about Charles Manson, and distrust of police is just beginning to evolve. Something wicked has been lying in wait and the movie takes place in that small window where optimism began to shrink back in the American mind and people began ignoring hitchhikers and locking their doors. The insane complexity of the plot only serves to highlight this more--great evil is operating under the surface, but Doc can never be totally sure how much of it is just in his head, or who is pulling the levers. Or maybe everyone's got a lever except for him. It's tough to tell when you're lightin' up a J and just trying to help somebody out.",Inherent Vice

I admire the artistic courage it takes to try to turn a difficult book, an epic poem, whatever it is, into a bit of cinematic art. And I'm a fan of the main players in the film, particularly Joaquin Phoenix.I was OK with the muddled, non-linear plot. But unfortunately, I found this film pretentious and...ultimately...unwatchable. I really tried not to, but, I found myself...turning it off after about 40 minutes.

I don't mean that as anything more than an observation, and understand this as you watch the film because otherwise you'll be a little lost. The film just doesn't care whether you think this or that is good acting or a funny joke. It doesn't care what you think is happening. It will go on. Despite any perceived awkwardness, it will continue to be itself... and there is awkwardness.Fortunately, ""itself"" is absolutely beautiful. P.T. Anderson has mastered that Jacques Tati style wide angle and mixes it in with his earlier Boogie Nights fluidity for a confusing and awesome new style. He's done this before, of course, (The Master) but this time is pretty different. You'll notice it the moment that beautiful first shot appears. While I'm at it, I should mention the cinematography. There are colors in this film that I never thought I'd see again.From a story telling perspective, Inherent Vice almost seems like a Terrence Malick movie at some points. The narrator comes in and out like hypnosis and there's this air of evil always lurking behind all that beauty. There's love too, and the ultimate message, if you can call it that, falls within the great rule of pop: it's best when it's bittersweet.",Inherent Vice

209,ChloeS89,Favorite film of 2014.,9,7 May 2015,"Many people have called ""Inherent Vice"" a combination of ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" and that's a very accurate description. ""Inherent Vice"" has all the hallmarks of a classic noir film (beautiful cinematography, chain-smoking, although with marijuana in place of tobacco, mysterious women, complicated plot lines), but also has the wacky antics of a stoner comedy. Many have criticized ""Inherent Vice's"" complicated plot. The film focuses on detective and stoner Doc Sportello's (Joaquin Phoenix) investigation into the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend, Shasta Fay Hepworth (the highly underrated Katherine Waterston). As Doc makes his way through the case, he uncovers many conspiracies and secrets and meets many eccentric characters, all the while smoking copious amounts of marijuana. All of this makes it difficult to follow which may require a second viewing to fully understand, but I believe this adds a certain relatability to Doc Sportello. Your confusion to the events that unfold parallel Doc's confusion to the events that unfold. Joaquin Phoenix gives a brilliant performance as Doc Sportello. Also, worth noting are Katherine Waterston's mysterious performance as Shasta Fay and Josh Brolin's perfect comedic performance as Bigfoot Bjornsen, the banana loving police officer. Even Owen Wilson and Reese Witherspoon give great performances (two actors I don't care for). Overall, ""Inherent Vice"" is a brilliantly complex film-noir tribute that's both hilarious and mysterious making it my favorite film of 2014.",Inherent Vice
210,DavidStewart57,A Stoned and Surreal Epic!,10,11 November 2014,"Paul Thomas Anderson's seventh film, Inherent Vice, is a surreal, kinky, and stoned epic of mammoth proportions. The fact that Anderson decided to be the first director adapt the wild prose of Thomas Pynchon is an achievement in of itself. Set in Los Angeles in the early Seventies, Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) awakens from his stony stupor when his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) tries to find sanctuary from her real-estate mogul boyfriend, his wife, and her boyfriend. In traditional noir fashion, not all is simple as it sounds as a bigger presence is involved with a cavalcade of characters thrown into Doc's world; a heroin-addicted sax player from a surf-rock band (Owen Wilson), a coked- up dentist with the libido of a rabbit (Martin Short), and an LAPD officer/failed actor (Josh Brolin) busting anyone with long-hair and forming a strange love/hate bond with Doc.The film is a hybrid of comedy, romance, and mystery inspired by the major film-noir flicks of the 1940s, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep and Fritz Lang's Ministry of Fear, except that rather than having Sam Spade chain smoke cigarettes and drink gimlets, you have Doc Sportello smoking endless joints and drinking tequila zombies. Anderson's perspective of Los Angeles in the Seventies has been shown before in Boogie Nights in all its hedonistic glory, but in the case of Inherent Vice, he manages to capture the mood of L.A. in an earthy, yet naive glow that mirrors the energy and fear that erupted in the wake of the Manson murders and the rise of Nixon's silent majority. No matter how you slice it, Anderson's film fits in the tapestry of other L.A. noir classics like Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, but with the comedic antics of a Cheech and Chong film or an episode of Gilligan's Island. Joaquin Phoenix gives a brilliantly-nuanced performance as Pynchon's anti-hero private eye. Unlike his last collaboration with Anderson on The Master, Phoenix reigns in his eccentricity with a relaxed, yet stoned, approach and manages to not make Sportello into a clichéd character of the counterculture thanks to the sharp wit and dialogue of Anderson's screenplay. Josh Brolin's performance as Bigfoot Bjornsen is brilliantly comical and tragic as he tries to walk amongst the Indica-smoke streets with the power and authority of Jack Webb from Dragnet. Katherine Waterston gives a remarkable performance as Doc's former flame as she gives a raw and naked performance that is both sympathetic and mysterious. Despite being on film for only ten minutes, Martin Short gives a performance of comedic gold with the eccentricity and insanity as equally as funny as his alter egos like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick. Among the other actors who fill out the film, Reese Witherspoon as an assistant D.A. and Doc's part-time love interest, Benecio Del Toro as Doc's confidant and Owen Wilson each give solid performances. Jonny Greenwood, in his third collaboration with Anderson as composer, creates a score that mirrors the Noir-fashioned sounds of Jerry Goldsmith mixed with the psychedelic sounds of the Laurel Canyon music scene of the early Seventies. Also, the music of Neil Young's Harvest album adds an emotional depth to the romantic interludes between Doc and the women in his life. Robert Elswit's cinematography is as excellent as his previous collaborations with Anderson as he manages to capture the long, strange trip into the underbelly of Los Angeles. Inherent Vice may be at times incoherent and somewhat dense as Pynchon's novel, but it is one hell of a trip!",Inherent Vice

In 1967, the California DEMOCRAT legislature passed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS), which allowed local, private (i.e., non-state) mental facilities to accept more patients—particularly those with more treatable or milder forms of mental illness.

There was no need for certain characters to even be in the film. They simply added noise. It was extra dialogue for no reason other than to try and take the viewer down a rabbit hole for a moment.The entire main plot didn't even matter...it had no point.

The only other memorable exception was Katherine Waterston's beautiful pouting face and super-hot body on display.

I didn't. *So let's say, hypothetically, that you are a filmmaker, and you watched Chinatown and The Big Lebowski and maybe one other film all at the same time on acid, twice in a row. Maybe three times. And subsequently, you had the idea to do a film noir in which everyone smokes dope instead of cigarettes, and it's set in the 60's near the beach in LA. And it's in luscious color rather than B&W. That's kind of what this film is like.The cinematography is of course just gorgeous. It practically looks like it was shot on Kodachrome or something. And I love that there's a brief tribute to James Wong Howe, which most people will probably miss. There's an assortment of other little tributes to better known popular culture that are actually surprisingly multi-layered, but I won't give any details. You just have to know what they are.Some say they can't follow the storyline - well, duh! The storyline pretty much smoked a big spliff laced with PCP or opium or something! But if you pay attention, you'll realize that the film actually does wrap up its various subplots rather successfully. I look forward to reading the book, but the film by itself is pretty successful in my opinion. It's one of very few films that I would pay full price to see again. Critics that don't like it are, in my opinion, not really watching the film that is in front of them. You have to take it for what it is: brilliant.",Inherent Vice

I found myself feeling the same way I did when watching The Counselor, another tragic attempt at screen writing that seemed determined to disrespect the talent hired to act their way through a maze of unrelated scenes.

217,The_Cake_of_Roth,The first Paul Thomas Anderson film I've ever disliked,6,6 February 2015,"Before seeing the film, I was told that it's much better if you just try not to piece everything together and just kick back and watch it all unfold. I definitely went into the film with this on mind. I expected a borderline incoherent plot based on many reactions I read and told myself to sit back and let it wash over me... and it still did nothing for me. I was strangely disengaged throughout the entire film (aside from a couple amusing segments, one of them involving Martin Short), something I've never been while watching a PTA film.For me, it was just scene after scene of talking talking talking... and none of it seemed to carry any weight or significance. Because so much of the movie is spent focused on the labyrinthine plot, it was really hard feel invested in anything that was happening. I wouldn't have minded so much if the movie actually had more humor. There were funny moments, but for me they were very few and far between... embedded in long stretches of tedium. I would have liked it better if perhaps the film took some more weird/bizarre detours that didn't have anything to do with the plot... that at least would have been more enjoyable.The pacing of the film felt so sloppy to me also... it moved in fits and starts. Long, drawn out scenes that never led anywhere interesting. Early in the film, I was waiting for the movie to sort of find a rhythm or a groove.... and it never happened. So many individual scenes felt like they existed in a vacuum and disconnected from anything else. I'm sorry to say, the movie feels sort of pointless and unnecessary, and I thought I'd never say that about a PTA film.The whole thing feels too literary if that makes sense and I feel like PTA wasn't very successful in translating this book to screen. It felt like I was watching a filmed novel instead of, you know, an organically flowing movie. I don't know, maybe Pynchon really isn't filmable. My disappointment with this film makes me wish PTA would have used this world, the character of Doc (or a similar character), and conceived his own original story.",Inherent Vice
218,DonnyMovieMan,Major disappointment from one of my favorite filmmakers,4,5 December 2014,"If you ever ask me who my favorite directors are I'll no doubt mention Paul Thomas Anderson. I would consider his first six films a near-perfect record, with his last couple films being his greatest advancements as a singular filmmaker. I hoped with Inherent Vice to see another great PTA film, one that continued the advancement of his style and progression as a filmmaker, but I was seriously disappointed with what I saw here. Inherent Vice is a psychedelic detective story with an un-engaging plot that makes no sense, and isn't supposed to in a way. It's sort of a comedy but it's hard to tell how funny it wants to be. It wants to say something about the decline of its generation but it just doesn't come across. The first hour is several one-on-one conversations between Doc and others about things that the audience doesn't understand. I had anticipated for this movie not to make sense, and tried to accept that it wasn't about the plot, but why am I watching characters talk about a plot that I'm not supposed to care about? What am I expected to get out of these scenes? It felt like David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis (not the best thing) in many respects. We've got fine actors that sometimes border on sounding mechanical in their impersonation of the caricatures of the genre, simply talking to each other about a plot that doesn't make sense, scene after scene. I seriously felt like going to sleep for a while at this point. What does PTA expect me to look for in these scenes? They might have a couple of comedic nuances here and there but that's not enough to keep me engaged or caring about what's going on. It escapes this succession of conversations after a while, thankfully, and after a middle section that feels kind of like more plot blur, it becomes sort of hypnotic and surreal in the style of The Master. In many scenes, the cinematography gives the film a dream-like quality, as does the again excellent score from Jonny Greenwood. There are occasional sequences of narration that describe a dying or lost world, but where is this world in the story? Some scenes appear to be very well done, but I just wished I could have understood what happened during them. You watch this film in a haze, and this haze is not the howling fun romp that some are claiming it to be. It's mostly boring with the lack of anything to latch onto story-wise, and at its best it's artfully hypnotic, but this doesn't prove to be as significant to the story as it thinks it is. As I said, I prepared for the plot to not make sense, but for a movie where you're not supposed to pay attention to the plot, there sure is a lot of plot. It's only occasionally funny, and when tries to be, I often don't want to laugh. The humor is based around subtleties, not built around the story or characters, so I don't feel like laughs should be rewarded.For such a great ensemble under the direction of a man whose normally gets career best performances out of his actors, the acting is somewhat underwhelming here. Joaquin Phoenix goes in and out of sounding like he's reciting lines in a surprisingly underdeveloped character. The worst are some of the smaller female parts which are straight imitations of their stereotypes. Josh Brolin brings the most to the film comedically and with varied personality. There are a couple of highlights in the cast (Waterson, Short) and some wasted roles (Del Toro, Rudolph (PTA's wife)) but nothing too memorable, like much like the film itself. While watching the film, I could see PTA's style in the visuals, but it oddly didn't feel like he was achieving anything with it, and he wasn't doing anything very new. Other than that, it was hard for me to see his style. If it wasn't his, then it must have been Pynchon's. I can't speak for his Pynchon's writing because I haven't read him, but this adaptation just feels like it shouldn't have happened. I've always admired that PTA's films feel purely cinematic, but much of Inherent Vice feels like it doesn't need to be a movie, dialogue heavy as it is. I can, however, see what PTA is trying to do with the visuals in creating a dream-like atmosphere, which works better than anything else in this movie. He occasionally pulls from Pynchon's writing style in the narration about oceans and a fading era, but this is not prevalent in the convoluted narrative whatsoever. I admire that the movie wants to mean something, and thankfully PTA hasn't lost that desire for his films to mean, but that admiration can't go too far when it amounts to virtually nothing. The movie might make you feel like it's beyond you for this reason, but I didn't let that fool me. I didn't enjoy this movie, I don't want to watch it again, and there's not a lot here that I liked. On a side note, even though it was two and-a-half hours and I didn't enjoy it, it strangely didn't feel that long. This feels like a waste of time and effort from one of my favorite filmmakers; a huge disappointment.",Inherent Vice

And boy has it raised the bar. I loved this movie. It is so original and engaging, with some comedy that I wasn't expecting. Some have said it was boring and confusing, but I was sucked in from the opening shot to the end credits. The film takes an old fashion crime drama formula with the private investigator and the winding staircase of clues, and injects it with some refreshing dry humor and surrealism.

221,darius-azadeh,PTA's take on Pynchon,9,8 February 2015,"Thomas Pynchon's novels have never before been adapted for screen. This could either be because of circumstance of simply because they wouldn't function as well as a film. Nevertheless, director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a stab with this 2009 novel, 'Inherent Vice', resulting in what can only be described as 'trippy'.When his ex-girlfriend reemerges to appeal for his help, hippie P.I Larry 'Doc' Sportello sets off on a quest to find her missing boyfriend, land developer Micky Wolfmann. Set against the kaleidoscopic backdrop of early 70's L.A, drug-fueled madness is sure to ensue along the way.This is a very curious film; with a lead character who is constantly high and caught in the tangled web of a neo-noir world, its a safe bet that things will be anything but straight forward, even being dubbed 'Incoherent Vice' by Anderson himself. That it certainly is, as the film's plot, much like the book's, requires your intense concentration from the start. For the first half of the film, this doesn't prove to be too difficult; however, as it reaches the halfway point, the story starts to loose it's feet. It then becomes this top-heavy amalgamation of wayward plot lines and drug-crazed hippies. Although this was deliberate on Anderson's part, it creates this sense that some sort of fulfillment is denied regarding the overall outcome. That's not to say that the film isn't terrifically entertaining. Taking on a much lighter tone that Anderson's most recent endeavors, it boasts wonderful design, brilliant performances and an authentic 70's joy-ride. As usual, Joaquin Pheonix is constantly great throughout, as the bumbling hippy leading the pack. The real stand outs come from the supporting cast, like Josh Brolin, as the flat-top hippy hating cop 'Bigfoot' Bjornsen, who is often butting heads with Doc yet occasionally plays nice. Brolin pins him as like 'a kid in a grocery store who cant get his fruit loops'. He manages pull this off in a brilliantly comedic way, adding to the films constant comic theme.The humour is one of the most understated elements in the film. Aside from the inevitable 'What's up, Doc?' quips (it is a Warner Bro's picture, after all), the obvious jokes are cleverly placed throughout, to keep you in tune with the madness as it sprawls beyond comprehension. The book itself is the same, and is one of the many ways in which this is a very faithful adaptation. There are even parts that have been completely recreated from the pages, which indeed do work with this level of direction and performance. Needless to say it looks stunning. The decision to shoot on 35mm (heat damaged, for some sequences) almost seems like a no-brainer. It brings out Robert Elswists saturated cinematography, bringing across a brilliant psychedelic pastiche. Coupled with set design to have the producers of 'Mad Men' sweating under their collars, it echoes as far back to films from the era such as Jacques Tati's 'Playtime', and is equally as fun.A cult film in the making, this Thomas Pynchon adaptation is not without some substantial problems. Although the plot is meant to be jumbled and complicated, it is intended to be seen through the hazy eyes of our main hero. Although an interesting concept, its not one that holds up for a runtime that is far too long. It wants you to get lost in the plot as much as the neon lit, laid back and saturated world it unfolds in. Inherent Vice is a mess, yet a thoroughly enjoyable one.",Inherent Vice
222,jjustinjaeger,It's no There Will Be Blood,3,7 December 2014,"To watch actors dryly deliver page after page of plot that no one comprehends or is interested in while they imitate the acting style of old Hollywood noir films and stoner comedies is not why I go to the movies. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great filmmaker when he uses his own voice, and thankfully this film is the only exception to that.Unless you're a superhuman, you won't have the memory (or attention span) to understand the plot. It's as if it's deliberately convoluted, like Anderson doesn't want us to know what's going on, or at least doesn't want us to care. Yet this is not the case because of the scenes that dwell on nothing else but dialogue whose only purpose is to read plot to us and maybe put us to sleep. There isn't any character beyond caricature. I don't relate to this Doc character beyond the his relationship with his ex-girlfriend which is the only thing that one can possibly invest emotion into, albeit this is not an emotionally driven story. The characters are supposed to be funny but I just found them bizarre. That being said, there is something about the overall tone and production design of the film that sticks. The meandering nature of the era is there and while we've seen many similar films about the 70s this film is just different. It's ambitious in the way that it's so plain but also strange, only many will have a hard time deciphering between art and bullshit. It's bullshit to me because there wasn't anything for me to take from the film. It was more ""this is kind of weird"" but to no end.I would not recommend this film to anyone unless you are a cinephile, in which case you just have to see it because it's Paul Thomas Anderson. I feel bad for anyone who naively walks into this film looking for something to enjoy and laugh at. Parts got laughs but they were widely dispersed in a film that just felt like it wouldn't end. Being the fan of Anderson's that I am I feel like this film was a waste of time. Even if you end up liking it (which I personally would not understand) you'll see what I mean.",Inherent Vice
223,DeanBenedetti,Paul Thomas Anderson Returns to the Groovy (and Paranoid) 70's with Polarizing Results,9,17 January 2015,"Is there any mainstream American director as consistently unique and challenging as Paul Thomas Anderson? Only the Coens and Terrence Malick (whenever he finds the time) come close, but I still say PTA is the king. Any time I watch one of his films, my immediate reaction is to watch it again, both out of enjoyment and to better understand the themes. In the case of Inherent Vice, the need to rewatch a movie of his was never so strong. To sum up the plot in a few sentences would be futile, so instead, I'll tell you the only things you really need to know before seeing Inherent Vice. First of all, don't try too hard to understand every aspect of the plot, or you'll give yourself an aneurysm. Even PTA, the man who adapted the script and directed the film, says he's trying to piece everything together. In pure noir fashion, the audience sees everything through the eyes of the protagonist, therefore only gathering what parts of the story PI Doc Sportello gathers, only catching what we can by peering through a singular keyhole. For a while, things will make sense, but especially in the last 45 minutes, we lose our grasp on the mess of threads and tangents and submit to a head-scratching acceptance. I don't think Inherent Vice is to be taken as a literal, straight-forward story anyhow. It's more impressionist in that it concerns itself with creating an atmosphere over a logical storyline. I mean, the films narrator, Doc's clairvoyant hippie friend, follows him through his foggy journey by what is referred to as doper's ESP. This alone should tell you that Inherent Vice isn't exactly grounded in reality. Beyond the confusing plot, there is still so much to love. Another main focus is Doc's relationship with his ex-lady, Shasta. This is the only facet of the story that Doc actually seems hung up on, and the few scenes that Doc and Shasta have together are as mysterious as they are oddly touching. It should also be said that parts of Inherent Vice are hysterical, other parts are unnerving, but everything, and I mean the entire movie, is infused with a thick air of mystery (and weed smoke, of course), so one has to accept this from the beginning before complaining about it being confusing later. Even if it's hard to get a solid grasp on what Inherent Vice is about or how it makes you feel, it's easy to appreciate the visual aesthetic PTA created for the time period. Shot in flat aspect ratio with a fine layer of genuine grain, this looks like it could have actually been shot in the 70's, as opposed to say, American Hustle. It has the dark 70's cinematography and some tracking shots that would make his heroes, Altman and Kubrick, proud. Props to Robert Elswit for shooting both Inherent Vice and Nightcrawler in the same year. This also marks the third consecutive collaboration between PTA and Radiohead guitarist/composer Johnny Greenwood. These two really are a match made in heaven. PTA loves making these tense, uncomfortable scenes and Greenwood always knows exactly what kind music would fit perfectly. For my money, he's the most interesting film composer working today. The soundtrack also includes two Neil Young songs, Vitamin C by Can, and a perfectly placed credits song by Chuck Jackson. I sort of expected PTA to provide a more lavish soundtrack like he did in his other retro period- piece, Boogie Nights, but I found the sparing use of pre-recorded music made the songs included all the more special. Inherent Vice is the first ensemble cast we've seen from a PTA film since Magnolia, and what a cast! Joaquin Phoenix, PTA's new Philip Seymour Hoffman (tears), is brilliant as always. Doc Sportello is a far cry from The Master's uncouth Freddie Quell, but Phoenix manages hippie scum just as well as anything. Given he's the protagonist in a film noir, he really does carry the entire show, and he does so gracefully and with a laid-back charm I've never seen from him. Other highlights include the orally-fixated Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson (please act more!), the gorgeous Katherine Waterston, Benicio Del Toro, Reese Witherspoon, singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom, Jena Malone, Maya Rudolph, the hilarious and amazing Martin Short, and Eric Roberts. A much more mature ensemble than in Magnolia but equally energetic and fun. Inherent Vice is a film that requires more than one viewing. To completely soak in all of its brilliance, it may even take three or four viewings. Personally, I have no problem with this, but others who require more straightforward stories won't be as willing to sacrifice their time. Despite the mixed reviews, my faith in Paul Thomas Anderson's genius has not been shaken one bit and I cannot wait to watch this film again and again.",Inherent Vice
224,daedaluseticarus,Pretentious mix of Big Lebowski and Fear and Loathing with a dash of Mulholland drive,3,25 April 2015,"I haven't walked out on a film since I saw ""Divorcing Jack"" back in 1998. I used to appreciate both PTA as a Director and JP as an actor. I really enjoyed ""The Master"", and I'm not an impatient man when it comes to watching films categorized as ""slow"". I don't need an easily digestible plot. But this film proved too much. Walked out after about 2 hours and 10 minutes. Felt like I couldn't breathe anymore. Films starts out as slightly more gritty Big Lebowski and then pops over to a more drug fused Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Heavy on the paranoia but still funny. Had it been trimmed down then maybe it could have worked. Instead the plot just drifts away over the horizon and when a corny sex scene goes on for way too long you just feel done.That fake documentary that JP did, pretending to become a hiphop artist really helps to explain the mood of this film. It's as pretentious and self absorbed. Still I'll give it 3 points cus of Josh Brolin's hilarious sushi scene.",Inherent Vice
225,DoctorKingSchultz,Hippie Scum,9,6 October 2014,"I was fortunate enough to see this at the 52nd New York Film Festival; the centerpiece of this year's festival, Paul Thomas Anderon's Inherent Vice (adapted from the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name) will no doubt divide critics and audiences. It certainly divided me.Immediately, the plot starts rolling. ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix in his '70s glory; mutton chops and scraggly hair), a pot-head private detective, is disturbed by the arrival of his ex, Shasta Fay (Katherine Waterston). She clues Doc in on a mysterious plot to kidnap a real-estate mogul (Shasta's current boyfriend) for his money, and the scrappy ""gum-sandal"" ventures off into the the beach-towns and high-hills of California. Receiving help/hindrance from his ""friend"" at the LAPD, Lieutenant ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (a clean-cut, hippie-hating Josh Brolin), Doc rubs shoulders with no shortage of strange and potentially-dangerous characters. And that's about as much plot as you're going to get out of me. Doc's adventures are almost episodic, and connecting the dots from A to B to... G? can be difficult. I have a somewhat-strong idea of how things unfold, but the specifics are lost on me. And I even read the book! However, I believe this wasn't entirely accidental.In describing Inherent Vice, Anderson has made reference to all kinds of classic detective stories and zany comedies. On the Hitchcock classic North by Northwest, he said ""Tell me again how he (Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill) gets to the middle of the field with a plane after him? I can't. How does he get to Mount Rushmore? I don't know, but it's great."" PTA goes for a film that is high on emotion and fun situations and low on intricate story. I describe it by saying ""There's a lot of story, but so little of it matters,"" and that's in the best way possible. Doing so allows Anderson to focus on his eclectic cast of characters.Phoenix's Doc is most-definitely comparable to The Dude (Jeff Bridges) of Big Lebowski fame, but he's a far more human character than ""The other Lebowski"". He has opinions, he's far more active and realistic than The Dude. He has moments of violence (one in particular that shocked me and, I'm sure, the other thousand people in the theater). The trailer's narrator mentions something like ""Doc's not a do-gooder, but he does good."" An apt description. Complimenting this burnt-out detective is Josh Brolin's charismatic badge-holder, ""Bigfoot"". Brolin plays Bigfoot as a straight man whose anger can burst out in comical brilliance. Even ordering pancakes with this guy is funny. The supporting players are equally on their game, but they have such little screen time it really boils down to Phoenix and Brolin. Martin Short appears for a scene that many I know are already considering to be the film's funniest; Owen Wilson plays a great character whose very nature I find hilarious; Katherine Waterston is excellent as Shasta, being morose and desperate. The others among the star-studded cast are all at least ""good"", but I won't delve into their roles, which are more like cameos.Now, it may come into conflict with what I've just said, but to me, Inherent Vice isn't particularly hilarious. The trailer certainly makes it appear to be an almost Tarantino-esque crime/comedy, but truly the tone is more melancholic. It's not a ""downer"", but the pale, sort of washed-out cinematography of Robert Elswit is far more subtle and restrained than something like Pulp Fiction or Anderson's own Boogie Nights. This came as a shock to me, as many were touting Inherent Vice as (paraphrasing) ""Anderson's most-anarchic film since Boogie Nights"". Perhaps so, but it never reaches that film's levels of kinetic energy and life. It's the yin to Boogie Nights' yang, to get metaphorical. It's more The Master than Magnolia, to keep the comparisons coming. However, with Inherent Vice, Anderson applies some of his hallmarks in new and interesting ways. His incredible tracking shots in Boogie Nights are replaced with more subtle long takes that will sometimes follow the action, but often stay nearly-static on a conversation for minutes. This immersive, unflinching approach allows you to become invested in the performances.Similarly, Anderson's knack for putting together a soundtrack is tested in a new way. Rather than blaring '70s rock tunes, the Jonny Greenwood score and licensed tracks are included in a far more subtle way. Greenwood's score ranges from classical noir-ish tones to beach-like guitar music. It's an interesting choice, and one that didn't immediately strike me upon first viewing.Some have called Inherent Vice meandering, and I'd say they're partially right. Depending on how they mean that. It wanders like a lost dog, yet clearly there's a story going on. It's fragmented, maybe like Doc's mind as he's stoned, but it isn't exactly a first-person view we're getting. It's odd, to say the least, but not in an in-your-face way. It's odd because you'll walk out likely-unable to connect the story, but you'll remember distinct scenes. Even those scenes though, may have subverted your expectations.My ""review"" here probably sounds inconclusive, and that's because I'm still not positive how I feel about Inherent Vice. It's definitely worth seeing; Anderson is an incredible force with a pen and some film stock (nicely, we were shown 'Vice on 35mm; referring to the Film Society of Lincoln Center's slogan, Anderson said something like ""Tonight, film really DOES live here!""), and I truly believe him to be one of the all-time greats already, with only seven films under his belt. So hopefully my little pontifications have been of some interest. Able to hold you over until this goes limited in December, or for some of you, wide in January. Temper your expectations, take the trailer with a grain of salt, and I'll see you on-line when it opens again--I need to see it again!",Inherent Vice
226,gregg_shoe,Mind-boggling,10,12 January 2015,"This is a fantastic movie with spectacular acting. When I first saw the trailer for this I thought ""pass"" and then went to see this for lack of anything better to do and because some good people invited me. It was a great choice to go see, I would have missed one of the best movies to come out this year. The story is about a stoner P.I. and his quest to help his ex-girlfriend figure out what to do about her married lover and his cheating wife and all his money.Many times just as I thought I was catching on to what was happening and had figured out where the movie was going it suddenly took a left turn and went down a completely different yet more strange and bizarre path then it had already been on.Joaquin Phoenix plays his character so well it is hard to believe he is not truly Sportello. He seems to have become a 70's hippie in every sense.Owen Wilson gives a lack-luster performance that seems as if he has made no real effort. His one spot of greatness comes at the 'Spotted Dick' party but that is all. The rest of the time you are not at all interested in his character.Josh Bolin has outdone himself in his role as Lt. Christian F 'Bigfoot' Bjornsen. I was never quite sure of the real relationship he and Sportello actually had. Antaganistic but at the same time partners and even it seems friends (almost).Katherine Waterson's character Shasta Fey Hepworth is mysterious and alluring. She seems to always be about to reveal the truth of what is happening yet never does.In the end this movie will only disappoint you if you are expecting to see a straight mystery set in the 70's. However, if you go into the theater with no preconceived ideas and with an open mind ready to listen and allow the actors to take you on a fantastic ride you will come out wishing you could meet Sportello and hoping you never have a run in with 'Bigfoot'.",Inherent Vice
227,b-connal,"Drenched in sex, drugs, corruption and confusion",6,6 April 2015,"A film drenched in sun, sex, drugs, corruption and (a certain memory of the) seventies with mixed results.I have longed for a return of the detective movie which has recently seemed the preserve of TV or HBO series and Paul Thomas Anderson approaches the genre from left-field which should be applauded. Denying the viewer all the necessary information to join all the dots, pacing which is languid and the creation of a heady atmosphere the film at times is intoxicating and confusing. Often you find yourself like Doc grasping for the information however Doc seems to have a clear overview while the viewer will often be lost. The choice of the viewer is either to go with it or get out.If the viewer sticks with it they will be in for a long ride and there is no guarantee of being fully rewarded at the end.I am a fan of Joaquin Phoenix and his performance maintains your attention especially the scenes with Benicio Del Toro however these still do not prevent you from getting lost in the haze.Recommended for fans of the genre and Joaquin Phoenix but to fully enjoy the film you will have to be open minded and prepared to walk away from the cinema unsure of where you have been.",Inherent Vice
228,cskjott,Incoherent Crap,5,10 March 2015,"Phoenix is an immense power and certainly so is Brolin, as for the rest, they're chewed off as fillers at random, nothing but stepping stones for the two main acts, who are really just putting it way out there, literally.Sometimes there is no point and this movie is such, without scope, pointless and therefore quite unfunny. Just keeping up with the elaborate and silly names in this movie is trying and there's not a scene without one.. Who is what, who? Who again??Regrettably this is nothing but an attempt at being interesting and I admit the bar was set high, but to sum it up, I think the title is misleading; it would have been better with 'Incoherent Crap' to the sounds of music, and I find myself submitting this review to write just that, because it's what I got from it, I just kept nodding off, and if that is good enough for you, then this movie is a blast in terms of watching the very best of the bunch today in flashes making a lot out of basically nothing but complete nonsense?! I still haven't made up my mind about where the faults are in this movie, it could well be the editing or simply the script, because the acting was impeccable and so were the settings, albeit many of the vehicles were from a different period (but that would be nitpicking) A strange and wobbly vehicle for two established stars, the rest of the stellar cast along with Owen Wilson, Martin Short, well they just came up short with nothing but bit parts in an incoherent and silly story without head or tail and the ending is nothing but painful.And for those of you, like I, thinking that this would possibly match 'The Big Lebowski' you've been intentionally misled and you will be most disappointed! I was full of expectations going in, but I quickly found myself just nodding off... I had three giggles.. But in between I had a good snore, so the wife tells me!I may watch it again, just to make sure I wasn't wrong, but I don't think I will.

As for the movie, well, it is almost impossible to review. There's too much going on in. I thought it was the finest and most complex blend of comedy, drama, historical, cultural and political recalls I have seen in years. It is utterly funny if you do not mind not catching every bit of the plot. Some shots and most of the dialogues are truly beautiful, every single moment involving Shasta in particular.

It is a Paul Thomas Anderson film, with that given fact you would think this movie would be on par with it's hype, if not surpassing it. Being a project developed by PTA, of course it has a stacked cast of versatile actors and unique cameos. With all of the big names attached it ended up coming out quite flat, with a storyline that almost seems at times to be non-existent.There were a few different elements that dragged this movie down a few notches mostly in the fact that this movie was lacking the action, causing it to seem a bit dragged out. This aside the dialogue had a strong sense of realism and had a few witty jokes/statements carefully positioned throughout. Although the writing is rather complex, if there had been better pacing and an overall stronger sense of story, this could have been so much more.The performances from the main characters, especially that of Joquain Phoenix was a sight to see. The impressive acting in turn, helps to perfectly capture the era of 1970's Los Angeles and the infamous hippie movement that followed along with it.Overall this movie didn't quite live up to the hype, due to a dull script, which at times is a little hard to follow. With its exceptionally capable cast and crew, it is worth a watch just strictly out of curiosity, if anything.6.5/10",Inherent Vice

Could it be that you're already apologizing for this-- whatever it is? There is a way to sum up this film: It's a mess. Worse, it's a bore. Possible spoiler alert:Yes, there are occasionally amusing moments in it, notably, in the scene at the institution at which almost everyone our private eye has been interested in turns up. And in an earlier one in which a telephoned informant characterizes one of the characters. I hate to think that Pynchon, whose ""V"" I really prized, wrote what I saw on-screen. As for this director, I shoulda known. I've had more than misgivings about everything I've seen by him, with the exception of ""There Will Be Blood.""But there are things which seems to appeal to a particular generation, and this film maker and his films seem to do that. It seems to me that to enjoy this movie, three things are necessary. First,in order to keep the lengthy list of characters in mind,you have to be able to recognize all the celebrities that you know from TV, etc. in the minor or evanescent roles. (See cast list, IMDb)Next, you have to have great faith in the abilities of this director (Faith is a gift).Finally, it seems to be a requirement that you've read the book so that you can mentally supply what isn't there on-screen.

234,mattspach,A Real Brain-Twister,9,5 June 2016,"Although I must admit that this film is incredibly hard to follow on the first watch, the entertaining moments are worth it and the exact plot line is not the most important thing about the film. Based off Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel and directed by Hollywood's mastermind auteur PT Anderson, Inherent Vice is like a drug in itself. From scene to scene we may not know exactly what is happening in terms of the story, but clearly neither does our lead character Doc Sportello, portrayed in another convincing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The hippie private detective's series of conspiracy theories evolve slowly as he collects more ironic and oxymoronic snippets of information. His quest to locate his missing ex-girlfriend which grows into a search for real estate mogul Mickey Wolfman, then leads to an obsession with an underground group known as ""The Golden Fang"". Are they a syndicate, smugglers, sailors, dentists? I hesitate to give too much away, but I will say that the cinematography and editing employed here are fitting to the story without ever becoming intrusive to the viewing experience. We never leave the side of Doc, as we follow him through every single scene. In this way, we experience the mystery in his shoes, and are able to feel his confusion and obsession by exposure to the exact same developments that he is. On the second viewing it became a million times easier to grasp the detailed plot, making the humor and situational irony even easier to appreciate. Another unique and enjoyable piece by Anderson, Phoenix as his male muse. Good performances, stylish filmmaking, and a complicated story that paints a picture of a comic-bookish character within a transformative point in California history.",Inherent Vice

I felt like I was watching ""The Big Lebowski"" (which has a similar plot) with all of the humor stripped out, which isn't surprising because I just can't imagine Joaquin Phoenix doing comedy.

Some of his films have been right on the money (Boogie Nights, The Master), some brilliant (There Will Be Blood), a mixed bag of humor and oddity (Punch Drunk Love), and a three hour symphony of tragic melancholy that feels like a hundred pound weight on your chest (Magnolia).

Having said that, I just knew this movie would be better with a second viewing and I kept that in the back of my head while watching it. My reason for thinking this way is 'cause PTA tricked me several times now.I didn't watch There Will Be Blood when it first came out 'cause I thought it would be a Preachy Oil movie, BOY was I Wrong! It's more an in-depth character study about a man you can relate with, but still pity a little for his greedy nature (He has a competition in him).Then we heard PTA was gonna tackle SCIENTOLOGY!(in The Master). That just blew my mind. Philip Seymour Hoffman playing like an alternate version of L. Ron Hubbard, sounds AMAZING. Of course we now know The Master doesn't really focus on stuff like that and it disappointed me a little with the first viewing. I have seen The Master like a million times now and it's now one of my favorite films about friendship and ego.So after that we hear PTA is gonna tackle a Stoner Detective Thomas Pynchon novel (Inherent Vice). Pynchon is as famous as he is infamous for his weird but poetic writing. Combine that with PTA's awesome directing and I knew I was in for something good. Quickly into the movie I realized I wasn't following the plot as well as I hoped and it frustrated me a little. But the protagonist Doc (Joaquin Phoenix)seemed just as confused as me by all this different plot points being thrown around. I realized PTA tricked me again. This is not a ""You better pay Attention!"" movie like for example Chinatown. It's all about the trip you have with Doc in this weird post 60's stylized stoner/hippie movie with some detective stuff going on along the way. So despite what a lot of reviews say, this movie doesn't perse need a second viewing. Having said that the movie is VERY re-watchable in my opinion and I still recommend a second viewing.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as doc and is the center of the movie, but I think Josh Brolin's character (Bigfoot) is one of my favorites of all PTA films.A little side note: Very misleading trailer I'm glad I didn't see it before the movie.

I've seen this film a few times now and I like it more everytime I see it. The first time I didn't really like it because I was trying to keep up and get my head around the plot but after I became enlightened to the theme, then I was just able to sit back and experience the journey. It is a great character study. Joaquín pheonix is fantastic and his character is great, all the characters and performances in this film are great and fun, Josh Brolin works really well and had great chemistry with Pheonix, and Martin Short was hilarious when he came into the film he was amazing. There were so many great moments and great lines scattered about like when he visits the golden fang institute. The dialogue on the whole is inconsistent as a lot of it is exposition for the plot but when it isn't that it was fantastic. This is one of the most enjoyable films because you don't need to worry about understanding the plot because you're not supposed to understand it and instead just sit back and relax. The directing is great as always from PTA, the film is really well made. My only criticisms are the film gets weaker in the last 20 mins or so and probably should've ended earlier and that some of the dialogue is just exposition. However I love this film on the whole, I love the soundtrack and the unsatisfying ending reflects the whole film, it reflects the character and how really he gets nothing done in the whole film.

246,monkyman347,Inherent Vice is a rambling drug-fueled odyssey,9,22 December 2014,"'Straightforward' is not a word I will use in this review to describe Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film Inherent Vice. Lying somewhere at the crossroads between a '70s neo-noir film and an absurdist stoner comedy, this neon-tinged detective story is two-and-a-half hours of increasingly absurd psychedelic mayhem. It's dense, confusing, chaotic, and absolutely riveting in its amorphous plotting and paranoid atmosphere.Musician Joanna Newsom plays Sortilège, the film's narrator and our guide through the hazy story of hippie-turned-private-detective Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix). The story starts off simply enough, with Doc hired by his ex-girlfriend Shasta (Katherine Waterston) to locate her missing lover, but it all quickly spirals out of control into nearly a dozen different sub-plots featuring neo-Nazis, real estate, dentistry and everything in between.As the first filmmaker to adapt a Thomas Pynchon novel to the screen, there was a great deal of pressure on Paul Thomas Anderson to successfully translate the source novel's complex prose into a relatively understandable film. Pynchon's work is known for featuring dozens upon dozens of characters involved in a variety of loosely connected plot lines, which makes it nearly impossible to faithfully adapt his novels. Of course, anyone who has seen Anderson's epic ensemble drama Magnolia can confirm that the director is more than capable of seamlessly interweaving countless characters and story lines, and in the case of Inherent Vice Anderson truly does an astounding job of packing so much dense material into a feature-length film. Although the plot is hardly comprehensible upon the first viewing, a second or third viewing reveals that, while intensely complex, the story is entirely coherent thanks to Anderson's clever, brilliantly- crafted script.That comparison to Magnolia may be misleading, however, as Inherent Vice occupies a unique place in Paul Thomas Anderson's filmography. While Anderson has dabbled in comedy in the past, most notably with his dark rom-com Punch-Drunk Love, his humor has always been a cover for the far more deeply rooted melancholy that permeates all his films. While Inherent Vice's humor does take a backseat to the film's central mystery, it's nonetheless far brasher than that of any other PTA film. Anderson himself compared the film's comic timing to that of '80s screwball comedies Airplane! and The Naked Gun, a comparison that is uncharacteristic of his typical style to say the least. While it's surely more a neo-noir than a comedy, the film has more than enough laugh-out-loud moments to make it PTA's funniest movie to date, as well as a unique next step in his evolution as a director.While Anderson's script does deserve its fair share of credit for the film's absurd humor, what really makes Inherent Vice so funny is the acting, especially that of Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin. Phoenix's portrayal of our perpetually stoned protagonist Doc is universally spot-on; with a wonderfully out-of-it expression frozen on his face, Doc stumbles through the movie dazed and confused in a marijuana-induced haze. The smallest details, such as Doc aggressively slapping himself in the face mid-conversation to focus, are what make his performance so consistently enjoyable. Brolin, meanwhile, steals the show as hippie-hating cop Christian ""Bigfoot"" Björnsen, who both antagonizes and collaborates with Doc to unravel the film's tangled web of mysteries. Bigfooot's many idiosyncrasies, including the inadvertently suggestive way he eats frozen bananas and his not-quite-mastery of Japanese, make him by far one of the funniest and most colorful characters of the film, and Josh Brolin plays him with just the right mix of hotheadedness and cluelessness.Despite Inherent Vice's one-of-a-kind style and atmosphere, it's still ultimately not going to work for a whole lot of people. It's virtually impossible to follow the plot the first time around, and its many subplots and manic storytelling style will surely frustrate and alienate many viewers. For those that can tolerate its eccentricities however, it's a rambling drug-fueled odyssey worth taking and, while it may not be his best work, yet another impressive showcase of Paul Thomas Anderson's incredible talent and versatility as a filmmaker.",Inherent Vice

Although i am the first one to admire strange movies, this one didn't work out so well for me. It could have been made in the 70s , yes, it has the texture, lighting, editing style of B-series style movies. It smells like a cult movie, has the taste of a cult movie, and the consistency of spoiled whip-cream. There are a few surrealistic scenes that save this movie and River Phoenix does a great performance as usual, but that does not make a movie. It is a harsh critic, yes, because from such an excellent director and writer i would really expect more specially in an era where cheap Hollywood movies prevail.",Inherent Vice
248,elainejergens,I tried but...,5,9 May 2015,"Maybe I need to watch it again. I didn't like The Master the first time I saw it but now it is one of my favorites. There Will Be Blood and Boogie Nights, which are actually two of the best movies ever made so my love and respect for PTA does not waiver. But Inherent Vice didn't really give a me a story to work with at all. If you were to ask me what it was about I couldn't give you an answer. A private investigator is trying to investigate a potential crime that his ex girlfriend handed him and as he investigates, he realizes his ex girlfriend is missing. He runs from lead to lead gathering up bits of useless information that doesn't seem to tie together with what he is doing. Many scenes, many dialogues that went on too long and produced nothing. What was the point of all these characters? Especially Owen Wilson. His entire bit was unessential and meaningless. Aside from Reese Witherspoon's small role I think every single woman was miscast and horrible. The worst female casting job I have ever seen in my life. Belladonna? Really? A porn star with terrible skin. WTF? Where did they dig her up from? The rest of the women seemed to be trying really hard to have an obnoxious sounding voice. Seriously. Every time a female character opened her mouth, a stupid sounding voice would roll out would come squeaking out. The film was even narrated by an obnoxious sounding voice, the Asian hooker had an obnoxious voice. Just all of them. And Katherine Waterston was awful. I could barely watch her. Every scene she was in made me cringe. She had the right look I suppose but she has NO natural allure at all, she was repellent in fact. If an actress isn't sexy, they shouldn't ""try"" to be. Because that is just no good. The come hither looks, the fake sexy talk, the fake sexy walk that a woman who had never walked along a beach in a bikini before in their life would think was sexy and attempt to do. I could have gone without seeing her fondle her terrible looking breasts in the final scene when she was trying to be seductive...contrived sex appeal is bad sex appeal. It was more like a drunk/stoned chick trying to talk to you while they are on the verge of passing out but trying hard not to. Not hot. Bad casting job, just very very very bad. Joaquin was brilliant though! Brilliant as always. So were his filthy feet. And Martin Short was really great to see!",Inherent Vice
249,diogobulhosa,Don't feel stupid if you don't understand it. Feel stupid if you don't try to!,8,28 March 2020,"As a new person to Paul Thomas Anderson movies since this is the second one that I've watched from him (the first was the amazing There Will be Blood), I'm starting to fall in love with his movie style.I've read some other reviews, and a lot of people rate this movie has bad because of its confusing storyline, and to be honest they are fairly right. What I don't understand is, how they consider movies like Mulholland Drive, or even Pulp Fiction (in a less dramatic saying obviously) has argumentative masterpieces in terms of new ways to present a scrip to the audience. And this are movies where the directors do this because they want to, on a way to give the audience a far more interesting and personal experience, but in the end, it's the director choice. On the other hand in Inherent Vice what happens, and the reason of why the story is so confusing its because we are actually watching the unwinding of a case in the mind of the stoner Private Investigator, ""Doc"" (Joaquin Phoenix) , deeply sunk in what should be a simple little problem that his ex-girlfriend, Shasta (Katherine Waterson) was involved.Now putting aside, the deep and confusing storyline, and jumping to the characters, every role in this movie is presented in truly astonishing way. As almost everything is in this film, some are very hard to follow, and to understand from where the hell they came out, but after a while, they all begin to connect and you start understanding that just like in Tarantino's iconic Pulp Fiction, all characters are related by some sort of coincidence (or deal, or crime, etc), and this story, although mainly focusing on Doc, is also a group of other small stories that are also connected. As every good movie about the 60's and 70's, this one respects the slang and the style of talking used this period, sometimes making it, again, hard to follow. Furthermore, a very interesting factor about the characters, is how they all seem to come together to show how the hippie idealistic ""peaceful world"", a 60's symbol, was destroyed by the greed of human nature, and the capitalism created by it. It also shows how some true believers of the hippie cause, like Doc, survived because they never got in the useless, need-buy cycle created by the capitalism (I'm not saying I agree with this, and I don't want to get all political, but in my point of view this was a critic by the director and a very well made one, that I think it's important to mention).The movie is beautifully shot, and the partnership between PTA and the Oscar winner cinematographer Robert Elswit, works yet again (Robert Elswit's Oscar win was actually working for PTA in There Will Be Blood). The movie also has a very good soundtrack made by Jonny Greenwood, who previously worked with PTA in two other projects. All the actors give very good and credible performances, with emphasize on the great Joaquin Phoenix who once again does a brilliant job, but also Josh Brolin, ""Lt. Bigfoot"", who has some of the funniest shots but also serious lines in the movie.In conclusion, this film is not as bad as everyone say it is, this is actually a great movie, the problem is: some people are just to lazy to try and understand it. This is not a film to watch once and go to sleep. This is one to watch, try to understand it, and just like in a case, try to solve every bit of it that there is to solve. Every word, every distorted reality from a pothead mind like ""Doc"", every weird character connection... Seriously hope you watch this movie, and if you do, when you get to the end don't feel stupid because you didn't understand it, only feel stupid if you don't try to understand it. That's the whole point of the trip!",Inherent Vice

It is very Big Lebowski"" like as the main Character the ""Doc"" is a very likable loser who comes across all sorts of interesting and funny characters throughout the movie. Most of the dialogue between the big name actors (Brolin, Del Toro, Short, Witherspoon) is super funny but you either can not follow the plot at times or you just don't care enough about it for the none funny parts to remain interesting. I love the scenes with Phoenix and Brolin especially! Trimmig this movie a good 45 minutes may have been enough to save this movie without having to overhaul the plot but unfortunately that was not the case and though this movie is heads above better than ""Punch Drunk Love"" and had great potential, in the end I was left unsatisfied.....my grade is actually closer to a 6.5 than a 6 but still nothing to write home about.",Inherent Vice

Once you've gotten over the frustration of trying to put the pieces together and accept you're not going to get the full perspective of the storyline, you can begin to appreciate the themes of the film and what the film is really about. The random comedic tone of the film takes the seriousness out of the plot and shifts the focus on the characters which is where the bulk of the enjoyment and interest within the movie lies. This movie is brilliant in making you feel like you just spent 2 and a half hours fully submerged in the mind of a drugged up hippy which is why this movie feels so messed up.

Director very refined lead film to the culmination and don't lose the stream and level of action in film. There is no any exaggeration in film. Phoenix is main actor and successfully upgrade the film in step-up level but screenplay is most important here and ability to hold all ends in hand. Very good is also Reese and Benicio in sideline role but without Phoenix this will be very empty. His magical way to talk with silence is indicator of good actor.

257,mrwwe-95402,I really wanted to like this.,1,26 April 2018,"I've seen some of PTA's films recently like There Will Be Blood, Magnolia and Boogie Nights. And it's only natural that I really wanted to see Inherent Vice, given that it's a PTA film and has, one of my favourites, Joaquin Phoenix as the lead. The plot summary seemed a bit okayish. But so are the summaries of other Anderson's films. So I had some kind of hope despite the low rating it had.I start the movie, 20 minutes in and I totally lost track of what the hell was happening. For a moment, I thought ""Okay maybe I just had a good lunch and I wanna sleep"". I sleep, then I watch the movie from the beginning. NO CHANGE. The movie becomes painfully self indulgent as it progresses with some laughs here and there. I swear no viewer, without reading the novel, could tell the complete plot. And no, this isn't The Matrix or Interstellar or Donnie Darko, where the necessity for a complex plot is mandatory.I literally had to read the synopsis every 5 minutes to understand what's going. I know that I'm not that dumb, and I do like art films (Tree of Life, The Fountain). But this is not art. Sadly from a great director. Acting is just fine. Phoenix isn't even interested or that's his character perhaps, I don't know, I really didn't care to be honest. Josh Brolin and Owen Wilson just want to get a break from their usual brand of films.Overall, inherent vice is an incoherent mess and please don't hesitate to say this films sucks just because its from Paul Thomas Anderson. Stay away or watch other genuinely great PTA films.",Inherent Vice

This film really spoke to me on a personal level. Yeah the overall story/plot is nearly impossible to understand and keep up with, but honestly it's everything else about it that I couldn't turn away from; the atmosphere, theme, characters and dialogue! The best way I can describe it: hypnotic and puts you in a sort of state of high! The main character played by the man himself is pretty much me in real life, his style, groove and how he overall presents himself and gets treated by those that don't really approve of his type. After watching this movie a couple of times, it's already in my top 20 favorite movies of all time.

Maybe I need to watch it again?"" And he always has a way of presenting the ending that would make you sceptical about your own understanding of things and your judgment upon.He believes or at least that's what he conveys: ""if you want to capture anyone's attention from the start, then take off the usual long boring introduction, to the point directly with actual hints and projections into what's coming during the upcoming two hours and a half, never be that obvious though, and let the story work it way out"".We have seen a glimpse on what things were about back in the 70's, with the sex, drugs & rock'n'roll life, the women, the men in that era, so revealing and real on what we heard of (we kids of nowadays), the novel certainly is the main source but the director/screenplay writer made it very clear to actually eject us back then, the actors were good, they embraced their roles to a satisfying point (especially for Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin), the mood and the story telling were just great.It is not his best works though, but it is definitely good enough for something to be presented as an art and a cinematic icon for the year 2014.",Inherent Vice

But the one thing I always detect about those films it that someone - the writer, the director - knows what's going on even if I don't. There's a sense of mystery and intrigue, yet one can be reasonably convinced that the answers do exist, somehow.This was not that film. I seriously doubt anyone had a clue as to what this was supposed to mean. ""It doesn't have to mean anything, that's the point, we live in a chaotic and meaningless world."" Perhaps that's true, but why should anyone care to witness over two hours of pseudo-noir stream of consciousness then? Explain that? Just hold up a sign that says, ""Life cannot be distilled into satisfying narratives, you're an insane monkey, and nothing means anything,"" and cut to black. I'll believe you, and still have two hours left to hit myself in the head with a hammer. This film is practically like reading ""Finnegan's Wake,"" am I supposed to be dreaming? What do I expect from Paul Thomas Anderson anyway, it's a fair question. I thought The Master at least kept opening new doorways in M.C. Escher's mansion; There Will Be Blood culminated in a brutal unease over man's ""worship of the obelisk,"" (2001: A Space Odyssey); Phantom Thread at least contained a tangible dynamic between two interesting forces...All that said, I wanted desperately to enjoy myself. The scenes were dripping with intensity. The impression that there was something there was ever-present, as PTA is always very apt to tease. The acting was superb, and the narrator gave me just enough yearning for some kind of cosmic order that I could hurdle myself forward through another scene, and ultimately another empty room.Why, Paul Thomas Anderson.

Inherent Vice is no small slip-up, but a huge blunder, an insult not only to PTA's legacy so far, but to film itself. It seems that Paul Thomas Anderson wanted to make as bad a movie as he could, while still having all the usual PTAisms (excepting the camera swing thing).Inherent Vice is one of the most tedious, indulgent, and arduous film-watching experiences I have ever suffered through. Where PTA's prowess as a director usually has the grace to save him from ruin taking on subject matter like porn in Boogie Nights, it can't save him here. Inherent Vice just comes out as a masturbatory waste reveling in immaturity and self-satisfaction. Robert Elswit did well with the regrettably few opportunities he had, offering up some beautiful shots. If it wasn't for him, Inherent Vice would be a surefire F. Naturally, there will be a flock of ralliers behind this movie who assert that all who don't appreciate it fail to grasp its maneuverings due to lack of an attention span or intellect and therefore should try some childish substitute of their suggestion instead. While I usually like to entertain such amusing thinkers, I can't find any accord whatsoever with such opinions in this case, and must respectfully dismiss any defense of this movie as anything other than a slightly well-decorated '70s quasi-noir jumble of half-baked, untraceable intentions. The greatest reward that the movie gives is when it gets to the end and this messy, played-out experience is finally over, never having to be returned to again. It will take a long time to forgive Paul Thomas Anderson for this, but he's got a long way ahead and the stuff to get back on track, so I believe it's only a matter of time.

264,lukasjreed,"Expect A ""Boogie Nights"" Instead Of A ""There Will Be Blood""",9,10 January 2015,"Inherent Vice isn't a bad movie by any means. I can only think of 3 reasons why some speak ill of this drug-fueled comedy/mystery/crime film. 1. The Characters: While main characters Doc, played by Joaquin Phoenix and Bigfoot, played by Josh Brolin, give award worthy performances, some might say that the supporting cast is too all over the place. While some people like Martin Short give scene- stealing performances, others like Reese Witherspoon have little to offer. 2. The Plot: The plot not only carries the movie, but even I think that it has flaws. New plot points keep getting added throughout and some don't go anywhere. Even the main plot seems to get lost in a sea of other issues leading to many unanswered questions. 3: Paul Thomas Anderson: No no no. I'm not saying he didn't do a good job with this movie. It's just that when audiences saw that his name was attached, it seems that their expectations went through the roof. With great films like ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""The Master"" under his belt, people seemed to think it will be on par with those films. And those people sadly didn't get much enjoyment. If you are going to see this movie, don't go in in hopes of another masterpiece. That way, you'll be pleasantly surprised in what a great film you just watched.",Inherent Vice

There were some funny parts throughout, but other than that, I wanted to leave this movie the entire time. Aside from occasionally laughing, I had far more ""what the f*ck's?""

And you are. Given its subject matter the movie is always going to struggle to outrun the shadow of The Big Lebowski and, like the Cowen brothers epic, the exact plot isn't that important, rather the Chandlerian Zig-Zag introspection into the Death of the American Dream where we realize that no one has a real handle on WTF is going on - so we're all in the same boat.

It's like when you read a full chapter of a book and realize you've been reading this whole time but thinking about something else so you have to go back and re-read it. To be fair, if you've read the book I assume you have an idea of what the story is and might like this adaptation. But for those of us that haven't read it, it's a confusing journey into a lack of story with no payoff. It was like PTA just turned on the camera and let the actors slowly get into character. The dialogue was so off-putting, like every average conversation had to be spoken in a Noir- esque fashion which ended up sounding false and unemotional. I understand it's supposed to be noir, but it just doesn't work for this movie. The first half seems like a Wes Anderson movie and ended very PTA style. Even the music doesn't fit. I like that he uses the guitarist of Radiohead for his soundtracks, but maybe should've went with better fitting songs. And the whole movie is overly narrated to the point where you feel like you're listening to an audiobook. To sum it up: there is so much going on its hard to follow, to the point where you just give up and don't care anymore. And then realize there is no substance to the story and you're left confused. I love PTA and I love artistic films that aren't afraid to go out of the norm and do something new and different. But this wasn't artistic as much as it was just disappointing.

271,faidrapunk,a mess or a well stractured wacky critique?,10,8 December 2018,"Paul Thomas Anderson knows how to write a script .He understand structure and how themes should move hand to hand with the characters and plot.THIS IS NO EXCEPTION!!!!!!Most of the haters of this film comlain about the script .It has been called aweful and ineffective.It most certainly is effective.If you pay attention from the beginning (as it is the case with many movies)you wiil not be lost .Chill out blaze your joint up and experience....for example ;the firs scenes introduces the two main characters .You get right of the bat the right idea about the relationship and both of them individually.This allows the plot to start and the next time we get insightfull information about thei relationship is one hour and a half into the movie exactly before the third act begins.this is the first element of many that this great script consist of.the script works. the acting is phenomenal as it is the case with most pta films(this is the guy who extracted a good performance from Adam sandler).Direction is effective , never too loud but ballsy and it certainly makes a statement.Cinematography is raw ,realistic colours and very seventies like.Basically a department from the sunny and hopeful woodstock era and the entrance to the grim and not very pleasant political landscape of the seventies(again a case when technicallity in filmaking serves the themes).Editing is smart and it lets the direction to breathe in the smoke from the burning full of thc californian marijuana. the music by jhonny greenwood is atmospheric representative of the era.Now lets descent into the thematic blilliance of the movie.Its a deconstruction of the deconstruction of the noir genre with a witty sattire on how capitalism and the realization of its involvement in our lives.The watergate scandal makes us want to go back in the simplicity of the sixties and indulge in our nostalgia old love and carelessnes.Even the repressed people who were a crucial part of the puppet game of capitalism start to envy the free spirit of those with no responsibility and while the free man can now grow and become a better person and the dog of the media is emotionally immature and in search for redemption.And while i could decorate this essay with many fancy and beautiful words and metaphors i should not .Because yes this movie is purposefully a mess and you have to experience it to get it .And if you dont like it it does not matter you will not hurt yourself by watching it soo watch it.Inherent vice refers to the mortal and perishable nature of human beings.chocholate melts ,glass brakes ....so lets make up the best of it......",Inherent Vice

273,taeschle,PTA Does Pynchon: Meandering Through Inherent Vice,8,7 October 2014,"""I never remember the plots of movies. I remember how they make me feel.""Paul Thomas Anderson, 10/5/2014, ""On Cinema Masterclass"", New York Film FestivalIt's nearly impossible to talk about Inherent Vice, PTA's new stoner noir, without providing some context.It's crucial to know, for example, that the film is an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel. It's also crucial to understand the novel's subject matter and setting: a sprawling conspiracy, which may or may not exist, that involves a real estate mogul, hippies, the LAPD, and a heroin cartel named the Golden Fang, all against the backdrop of Southern California in 1970, the year after the Manson Family Massacre. Some familiarity with Pynchon's literary output–both his prose style and unique narrative structure–is helpful as well, almost required. Finally, to really grasp Inherent Vice, it'd be useful to know PTA's relationship with plot, which can best be understood by reading the quote above and thinking about the trajectory of his career (a career marked by films that have become more and more ""plotless"").So, when we put all of this together, what do we get? To a large degree, we get exactly what we should have expected: a filmmaker creating a nearly-flawless adaptation of a nearly-impossible-to-adapt author. Wacky humor, a never ending stream of new characters (some of whom are neither introduced nor explained thoroughly), dialogue that sometimes feels like it's written in code, abrupt jumps between characters and scenes, unapologetically deep cultural references, long and wordy voice-overs, seemingly random occurrences that don't tie together, and a continual sense of paranoia that grows from the viewer (or reader's) inability to decipher what's real and what's imagined. Make no mistake, at the center of Inherent Vice is PTA's unyielding dedication to Pynchon's vision and his desire to put that vision, in full, on screen.But, PTA's decision to remain so faithful to Pynchon's imagination comes with its faults. The only character we really feel invested in is Doc, the stoner, private eye protagonist played by Joaquin Phoenix (Phoenix is in almost every scene and deserves another Oscar nomination for his fantastic work). The other characters end up feeling peripheral, almost like they exist only to drive forward the narrative of Doc's detective search rather than exist as individual characters we should care about. Even Doc's love interest, Sashta, who shows up at Doc's house in the first scene and asks for a favor that sets in motion the goose chase at the heart of the film, is difficult to care about. Her presence in the film, while strong in certain moments, doesn't seem to stick because it's so ephemeral, dreamy, and enigmatic.This is a flaw sometimes overlooked in novels (see DeLillo or Foster Wallace in addition to Pynchon), but it often distances viewers when done in films. More importantly, it's a criticism totally inapplicable to PTA's previous films. Boogie Nights and Magnolia also centered around ensemble casts, but in those films the viewer deeply cared about each and every character, whether it was Quiz Kid Donnie or pornographer-turned-speaker- salesmen Buck. The difference: PTA creating his own characters from scratch versus PTA capturing another artist's vision in uncompromising fashion.It's also important to remember that many of Inherent Vice's viewers haven't read the book. I can't imagine how wild of a ride Inherent Vice will be for them. It'll certainly be a confusing experience, somewhere between trippy and surreal, almost Lynchian in its opaqueness and lack of narrative continuity. Perhaps it can best be summed up by the words of a girl who sat behind me at PTA's ""On Cinema"" talk at the New York Film Festival the day after Inherent Vice's world premiere: ""It was good, but don't ask me to tell you what happened."" This confusion and general inaccessibility will turn people off, much like The Master left some people enamored and others disappointed and unfulfilled.Another important piece of context surrounding Inherent Vice, as always with highly anticipated films, is the prism of expectation. Many people predicted (and, I think, hoped) that Inherent Vice would be a return to form for PTA, a Boogie Nights Redux of some sort. They anticipated that the similarities between the films–1970's content, drugs, an ensemble cast–would unlock a time machine that catapulted us back to the earlier stages of PTA's career. Others, myself included, thought the film would split the difference between The Big Lebowski and L.A. Confidential, perfectly balancing the stoner laughs with tense and mystery-driven drama. These expectations were only furthered by Warner Brothers' decision to release a late and deceptively cut trailer, which I can only assume was a marketing decision made in reaction to The Master losing money at the box office.But, the simple reality of PTA's films is that they are so good and so unique precisely because they can't be predicted. In that sense, Inherent Vice is no different. It's a ludicrously ambitious film crafted by a director who appears more interested in challenging himself as a filmmaker than anything else. It's a film that's long on dialogue but short on plot (shortest on plot of all PTA's films, which may shock some people, especially those who weren't fond of The Master). It's a film that, for two and a half hours, takes its viewer on a journey, leisurely meandering through a certain time and place, all while fluctuating in tone from romantic to paranoid to stoned. While Inherent Vice is neither what some thought it would be nor what many wanted it to be, it's exactly what it is, and more importantly, perhaps it's exactly what it had to be.",Inherent Vice

Afterwards, I was ASTONISHED when my friends told me that they saw people leave the theater part way through complaining about the film. This movie is a lot of fun, smart, at times hilarious, and a delight to see in the theater. I figured out pretty quickly that this isn't the kind of film in which you'll be able to nicely pack all of the plot points into a tidy linear narrative and then I just sat back and enjoyed the spectacle. The performances were truly stellar, particularly Phoenix and Brolin whose scenes together were just a pleasure to watch. If you're up for something different from the norm, definitely go see it, relax your expectations about coming away understanding everything, and try to enjoy it for what it is - we don't get too many films like this these days and it's fantastic.",Inherent Vice

277,Magicmaster,Unique and hysterically funny!,9,12 February 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the few auteurs left in Hollywood. He gets to do what he desires, which makes me very happy. ""Inherent Vice"" is like no other film that came out in 2014. It can't even be compared to Oscar-bait movies like ""The imitation game"" or ""The theory of everything"" (who I by the way have trouble separating).What the film focuses most on is the atmosphere, like most great films. It's not really about the story, in fact the story gets harder and harder to follow as the film progresses, but that's not the point. The atmosphere creates this strange feeling inside of you and you get caught up with the character's relationships with each other and the strange situations surrounding them. It's a movie to re-watch (like most of Andersons movies).""Inherent Vice"" is hysterically funny. There aren't that many jokes, but the situations themselves are incredibly funny. Much of the films humor comes out of Joaquin Phoenix's performance. And of course I can't forget about Josh Brolin, he is outrageous in this. The cast overall did a terrific job.I think ""Inherent Vice"" is a huge step forward from Andersons last movie ""The Master"". It's more playful, atmospheric, thematic. Don't go into the cinema expecting anything normal that you can just watch to pass the time, expect something unique and something a bit too puzzling. It's not a movie that you can take a leak during. I haven't read the book, and I probably won't, because I find the film just so vivid and entertaining, I don't feel the urge to. Paul Thomas Anderson challenges the way of mainstream filmmaking, and even though this film probably won't achieve either award-success nor audience-acclaim, I think it should. Well done, Mr. Anderson!",Inherent Vice

279,inaaruldass,PTA's new film-noir/crime-comedy 'Inherent Vice',8,15 February 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a director who by now has shown that he can make any movie. Heavy dramas, light comedies, and this time he jumps into a crime-comedy called 'Inherent Vice'. The film is about Doc (Joaquin Phoenix), a pothead and a private detective who is looking for his missing ex and her new guy, a very well known real estate developer named Mickey Wolfmann. In between there is a lot of crazy characters and strange subplots. The film is 2 1/2 hour long and there's a lot you have to keep an eye on, making the film a tad confusing. Nevertheless, it's very entertaining and never boring. All the actors are really good and movie itself LOOKS so good with its stylish 70s-esque style. It's not a movie I would recommend for everyone, but if you are into 70s detective film, or movies reminiscent of 'The Big Lebowski' and 'The Long Goodbye', then perhaps this is a movie for you!",Inherent Vice
280,cabbagehead514,"Excellent ""Hippie Noir""",8,9 January 2015,"Inherent Vice is a misty, postmodern detective story. Call it ""stoner noir."" The movie has the hero ""Doc"" Sportello, investigating various interconnecting disappearances, kidnaps, alleged murders, drug rings, etc. All the avenues are somewhat surreal and only hazily connected. I was never sure exactly what or why Sportello was investigating, but I also never felt that I was missing anything. To me this is what the movie was aiming for, allowing for me to be just a little lost but also very entertained, with the mystery being apparent enough to follow, but still incoherent enough to invite hypothesizing.Similar to ""The Master"" this movie was not straightforward and could be challenging to the viewer. You can't wrap up each scene in a bow or describe each plot line with clarity. This is a movie that is meant to be murky. It entertains in this fashion. The acting and camera work are predictably and expectation-fulfillingly wonderful. This complex variation of the standard ""private investigator"" noir picture is entertaining, but it requires patience and in interest in a somewhat wandering narrative.",Inherent Vice

If you like David Lynch movies then this movie is for you. Don't try to make sense of it, just marvel that someone would waste their time trying to adapt it from a book that is ranked No. 32,833 on Amazon. It rambles on so much that you will completely forget what the main plot is supposed to be. Case in point: There are 110 cast members listed in the credits, I defy anyone to recall what was said by any one of them, and more importantly how they contributed to the plot. The budget was $20 million, small in comparison to the typical Hollywood film and the opening weekend was an abysmal $328,000, word of mouth certainly worked in this case. Save yourself the cost of renting it and just have someone you really don't care for explain the plot to you, in depth, so you can have another reason to dislike that person even more.",Inherent Vice

This time, it was way more enjoyable. I didn't force myself to follow the plot. I simply got on the Golden Fang and enjoy the ride without looking for answers. This movie isn't made to follow the plot in a regular way. You're supposed to feel the same sense of paranoia as Doc. Everything is a clue, but at the same time, nothing actually look like a clue. It's basically the same principle as detective movie where you follow the character through his case. But in this movie, there are no checkpoint or way to find yourself in this really pleasant mess.

Most of the dialog surrounds itself around our protagonist, ""Doc"" Sportello. We follow him as he attempts to discover what exactly happened his girlfriend.The film, mostly consisting of unvaried dialog between underdeveloped characters allows the fluency of the story to carry on smoothly. However, the overall lack of distinction of characters and plot corrupts, what would have been otherwise, a great film.The tone shifts throughout the story is perhaps the most notable direction the director decided to go with. A melodramatic comedy turns into a darkened revelation. Although, I do appreciate Paul Thomas Anderson's choice of storytelling. A fitting risk to accompany the bewildering setting of the ""hippie, drug intoxication"" era. Without this choice of direction, the film might have ultimately failed to produce the story it promised.

This masterpiece is a quixotic journey into the stoned and surreal world of Thomas Pynchon, whose works are even more difficult to grasp than Andersen's adaptation. For those who truly want to understand the meaning behind this Magnum Opus READ THE BOOK. Inherent Vice the book is even richer than the movie, understandably because a movie can only include so much detail. The book is vivid, colorful and at times incredibly loquacious. Andersen was able to take Pynchon's novel of epic proportions and faithful adapt it into a 2 and a half movie which I applaud him for. Those who attempt to trash this movie have probably never read the book which is why they describe the movie as confusing, uninspired, long, dull, and supercilious. However, I propose that instead Andersen was able to give loyal readers of Pynchon a look into the world of the psychedelic 60s with this genial and exquisite film.",Inherent Vice

The movie started playing, and for a little while we weren't quite sure what to think. It took some time for us to get into the atmosphere and understand what we were actually dealing with here. Once we got it, we just started laughing. We fell silent. We laughed. And we kept on laughing throughout the film. And when I left the cinema and walked out on the street and took the train home and went to bed, I kept laughing to my self in the darkness. What was I laughing at? I'm not sure, but God damn was it funny. The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the music, the endless amount of new characters, everything about this movie makes a lasting impression. It is a movie in which every scene is memorable. And a movie you can keep on quoting again and again and again for ages with your friends, and still laugh about it. Rather elegantly it avoids jokes of poor taste, and focuses instead on a kind of black humor that will remind you of another time and another place, probably long before you were born. It's not for everyone, I'll admit that. Some people may not like it, and that's OK. But I reckon that this movie will be watched for years by a small but dedicated following.

My expectations were even more lowered after critical and public reviews were split upon its release. Well...I loved it. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. My main problems with it were that it is 45 minutes to an hour too long and its plot is incomprehensible. It tends to drag due to its length and to the fact that the plot is hazy and lost, much like the protagonist. I ended up having to stop after about an hour 30, and finish it the next morning. This movie is more about aesthetic and putting you in this world than it is story. So in that way it is acceptable that the plot is so out of whack, but it is still bothersome at some points. Now to the good stuff. This movie is FUNNY. Phoenix and Brolin carry almost all of the comedy and their chemistry is fantastic. Every scene that they have together is utterly hilarious. This world is INTOXICATING. I was thoroughly entertained throughout most of the run time.

I stood in line for over 2hrs just to see this movie and wow what a pay off! This movie does few things movies do these days and that is be itself. It's this semi-ground breaking cinema that shows Paul Thomas Anderson is not scared to have fun and be serious at the same time and doesn't need to play it safe or do what you expect at the movies and neither is the original writer of the book Thomas Pynchon and boy are they a match! Now most people who see this film and those who won't like it are the same people that probably don't like or have even really read Pynchon, so let's forget about them and accept this for what it is a great film based on a good book by an amazing author. Joaquin phoenix is perfect as Larry Doc Sportello a stoner detective looking into the kidnappers of his ex-girls beau and real estate tycoon Mikey Wolfmann they both apparently just go missing and this leads Doc to a very many colorful character semi stereotypes of the 1960-1970's Era which all seem to center around something known as the golden fang what it is couldn't tell you, but what's apparent in this movie is the dying of a culture and all the things that go in between in late capitalism. Once when there was hope and promise once again now there is greed and control,the film is very deep and sad and romantic in this sense and the fact that no one saw it coming because they were all caught up and confused in smoky haze (as we in the audience are) it's sad because they are losing these hopes and promises, ""lost sight of"" maybe because of certain vices and only have to look forward to a grim future is what makes this films emotional center. The film kinda takes on the same dimensions as Doc's regular weed habits the funny bits are truly great, Phoenix is great at physical comedy him and Brolin are meant for each other and the other cast members just shine the few minutes when they are on screen honorable mention is Martian Short boy is he wild in this one!

Pretty damn fun!!!! and anyone who has ever done drugs knows they're not entirely sensible, like a dream) Just treat this one of those things and it's gold; SO happy I read the other reviews and knew to go in open-minded.In an effort to trailer it without any spoilers, Inherent Vice is Paul Thomas Anderson doing the big Lebowski which is a movie that if you don't like then that's totally cool, but I hate you and you're wrong.It also happens to be based off a clearly badass author (my buddy Tommmy Pynchon, whose biography is worth knowing) (he's confusing so I hear the way to go is V, then Gravity's Rainbow).Summary 9.3/10 but on the record 10 because this deserves better than 7.7 (which is its score c. Jan/9/2015). Buckled full of talent, sexy as, deeply deceivingly deep; Brought a Calgary, AB, Canada theatre to gut laughs; A modern classic from a top 5 (c. Jan/9/2015) director who started his career on a 7 game shutout; A work of art for those who realize it is what it is. PTA FTW.",Inherent Vice
298,charlienovotny1213,I am sorry it was not to good.,1,11 January 2015,"The movie was not funny at all! Absolutely one of the worst 2 hours and 29 minutes of film ever. I am sad to say but we would have rather wasted our time watching A Ghost Busters Rerun.I am sure a lot of work went into creating this film but please don't do it again. Thank you for ability to sleep tonight. All I have to do is replay this movie and snore. Yet, it will save us from having to use an ambien. There was absolutely no drama, no comedy, no action. From the beginning to the end the movie was an utter failure. If I want entertainment of this caliber. I will put my appendage into a Vice rather than watching a movie of this nature. Please do not make any more movies wrote by the author or allow this director to continue to work in the film industry. The Actors made the best of terrible script!.Thank youCharlie",Inherent Vice
299,michaeljdrnec,I'm thankful it was discount Tuesday!,1,15 January 2015,"This film had every opportunity to be funny, it just never took the time to complete the joke. Doc is just thrown out there with no background with which to frame his character. I quickly got that Doc was a stoner, didn't need the constant reminder. Rambling soliloquies that wend nowhere and seemed only a vehicle to keep nudity on the screen a little longer. I'm wondering what kind of bet that the stars lost to have to be in this film. I will give credit to Joaquin, his acting was brilliant, however he couldn't save a rambling, incomprehensible plot. This 148 minute film was 140 minutes too long, I'd like my $6.50 back.Drnec",Inherent Vice

301,porifera,Yaawwwwwnnnnn with some short giggles....,1,26 January 2015,"Another movie where the trailer makes you all excited and then you fall into a deep black hole after getting the full 148min. (!) experience.I have to say yes I laughed here and there for a second and all these laughs could have been cut together like an a Benny Hill slapstick episode - that's it.Waste of time , waste of excellent actors (wonder why they even signed up for the movie - just because of PTA???) and a huge waste of a an option to make something brilliant out of the script.....it failed.The plot (or should I say the 5647 parallel ones)is foggy, disconnected and senseless and my deepest respect to anyone who can follow it or can make any sense out of it.I saw at least 7 people around me in the theater who did fall asleep and a bigger portion who left the movie before it finally ended.Too bad.",Inherent Vice
302,will_reinsch,Masterpiece's like this are often misunderstood,10,4 February 2015,"I would like to start with the general view of this movie. All I have heard is people walking out of cinema's and people telling me the film is incomprehensible and unwatchable. This is coming from people who loved interstellar which by the way has an unnecessarily complex and incomprehensible plot (much like all of Nolan's recent pictures).I think the structure of this film and the way it is played out is kind of reminiscent of Kubrick. The film concentrates on the more important aspect's of a piece of art. The mood, emotion and the idea's. Thing's such as a straight forward narrative of a right winged movie are all thrown away.The film is also far less incomprehensible then you have been lead to believe. It doesn't bore you with long dialog's of gibberish no one understands (i'm looking at you again Nolan). It's clever enough as a movie to understand what it is. Hence why it does not need to explain itself all the time. It just unfolds itself and takes you along for the ride.Not one time was I bored with this film. It felt like it only lasted an hour. That's how much fun I had seeing this movie. I was either laughing my ass off, staring in wonder at the beautifully crafted shot's or simply being so caught up in the tension and atmosphere of the film that I would be literally frozen with wide open eye's.The film was also such a colorful piece. With an already fantastic lead character (much like ""The Dude"" from Big Lebowski only funnier and deeper as a character) this film had the most diverse and developed character's I have seen in a long time. For example the character played by Josh Brolin had both an authority about him and a stupidity which played off each other very well. Some of the funniest moment's where played by Brolin when he would keep obliviously giving off homosexual vibes which were made all the more funnier by his superiority and place in society. I would go on about all the other great character's and Brolin but I do not have the space.The last thing I want to touch on is the fantastic direction. Scene's like him walking through police officer's, waking up next to a dead body in front of a line of cop car's, running with his missing girlfriend through the street while it rain's and a scene right near the end where he walk's along the coast are some of the most breathtaking and well crafted moment's I have seen in a film to recent date (apart from Birdman of course). I just want to touch on the walking along the coast scene as an example, my god, it honestly felt like the end was near and he was walking on the edge of the world. It's strange how I got these feeling's just from shot's alone.Overall if you like a film that is filled with great moments, has a strange atmosphere that makes you feel like you're high, fantastic acting, diverse and well developed characters, subtle yet hilarious comedy, masterfully crafted shots and care's more about the mood, idea's and emotion's then go see this film! However if you like movies with a clear narrative that wrap's up everything in a neat bow, is filled with undeveloped character's you don't care about, explosion's, pretty special effects and generic directing then go watch transformer's or whatever bland big budget movie's are out at the moment because this movie simply wasn't made for you.This film has a very split audience much like a lot of masterpieces. This WILL be a cult classic in year's to come and I'm glad to be an early part of that cult!This movie reminded me what it is I loved about film in the first place.",Inherent Vice
303,ibadetshefiti,Very weird and bad,1,21 February 2015,This is the worst movie I have ever seen.I have never been more bored in my whole life.Worst 149 minutes ever spent on a movie.All the scenes don't make any sense.The way the actors spoke and acted was so annoying.The sentences don't make sense at all. There was not a scene where something made sense.If you want to pay for getting annoyed then go see this movie.Not funny at all. I may have laughed once because it was ridiculous.Wuek ...,Inherent Vice
304,metroactus,ghoulash,1,3 March 2015,"This movie was terrible. Plot was loosey-goosey and nothing more than a device by which to let actors recite a lot of meaningless gibberish. The humour was meant to be sardonic but doesn't even warrant a grunt of amusement, AND over 2 hours long? of this? Hollywood crapper. Barely made it through 45 minutes and then spent another 15 minutes debating whether i was already invested enough to finish watching it. Extremely amateurish, this movie is begging for an identity, it doesn't know what it wants to accomplish except waste people's time. The disappointing surprise is that so many a-list actors signed up for it. Yes I'm now filling up lines just like the movie did because I resent having to write 10 lines for a movie which only warrants the one sentence ""this movie was terrible"".",Inherent Vice
305,radcoleman,Awesome,10,28 March 2015,"Several negative reviewers seem oblivious to the fact that this is an adaptation of Pynchon's book by PTA and should be adjudged as such. It succeeds admirably in accurately capturing the the tone of the 70's. Greenwood's mix - from the plaintive Sukiyaki to Can and Harvest reflect the zeitgeist - as some of us can attest to. Without dwelling on plot details as others have,it needs to be said that Katherine Waterston's performance is staggering. Among others, her conflicted ""please walk me to my car"" and the six minute uninterrupted take of Shasta's attempted absolution of her sins with Doc are masterful. Anyone with production experience can attest what an achievement that is. Worth repeat plays to capture the nuances.",Inherent Vice
306,albertbullock-55740,You're not supposed to understand the plot,9,24 August 2017,"Sorry, I'm just writing here to correct some of the idiots on this website. Do you really think that the amazing PTA would accidentally make the plot hard to follow? No he wouldn't. It was a conscious choice from PTA so it would be faithful to the book it was based apon by Thomas Pynchon. The book and film aren't really about the plot that the audience is desperately trying to follow, it's about the paranoia and the fear of unknown during the transitional period from the 60's to the 70's, with the war on drugs, the hippy life style coming to an end (poor doc), the Charles Manson killings all happening at the same time. Everyone during this period, like our main character and many of the other characters in the film, was at a stage of confusion as they tried to piece together what was happening in the world, who to trust etc. Which is also exactly what the audience is trying to do as well, it's quite genius if you think about it that way. Proving that Inherent Vice is a notable candidate in PTA's hall of fame. Also don't complain about the fact its hard to pin point a genre on this, when was the last time you've seen a PTA film and have actually managed to label its precise genre.",Inherent Vice
307,mndthompson,"Hold On Tight, It's a Wild Ride!",8,27 May 2015,"This film was complex, refreshing, difficult to follow but entirely worthwhile. If you like period pieces, you will enjoy this film if only for the music (a few Neil Young tracks) but don't expect straight-forward historical accuracy. Inherent Vice humorously explores the very blurred lines between sanity and (drug-induced?) insanity and the ""straight edge coppers"" vs the ""commie hippies"". Lots of guest appearances and over-the-top personalities. There are also several compelling scenes that vary between laugh-out-loud and melancholy. It's a mystery, a love story, and a blurry misadventure all rolled into one. Hold on tight, it's a wild ride!",Inherent Vice
308,amymiah,What a load of utter rubbish!,1,26 July 2015,"Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. Weird, hard to follow and just just too odd! No risk of a spoiler here, I literally couldn't tell you what happened! Made no sense and didn't hold my interest whatsoever. In fact, this film so bad I'm writing this review before it has even finished! If you're thinking about watching this, don't waste your time. That's 2 hours ish (which felt much longer) of my life that I'll never get back. Plus a waste of £4.99 in rental! !! Now, to add to my evening of frustration, I've spent ten mins ( due to website glitches) registering for IMDb to warn you off and tell the world how I feel about this film, only to be told that I can not submit any review which contains 'less than 10 lines of text'. What is all that about? I've said what I want to say and have heard of text limitations but not text minimums! ... Okay, have I written enough to submit yet?!",Inherent Vice

Be warned though that if you are not familiar with Mr. Pynchon's work, it will take several viewings to really appreciate and understand the plot.

310,zeev-kirsh,good movie once you figure it out,8,30 December 2014,"this movie isn't SUPPOSED to make sense. once you understand that the plot is mostly a lot of nonsense that is very poorly connected and that you aren't EXPECTED to make sense of nonsense, then it's easier to sit back and actually just enjoy the scenes for what they are, good acting, good cinematography and usually compelling scene action. the movie does drag on a bit because it's long, but surprisingly, it kept my attention and the rest of the Brooklyn arts crowd (BAM theatre) . if you are too focused on figuring out the plot as I am, you will not too quickly realize about mid-way through the movie that this isn't going to be a whodunit. there is no one 'dun-it'. if that's a spoiler, admittedly a vague one, well then, sue me. but you will enjoy the movie a lot more just watching it for what it is; a trip. and a good, if somewhat nonsensical magical realism, one at that. the movie isn't going to tie together, the ends and threads are so loose, it's readily apparent half way through the movie that it's intentionally bullshit and misleading rather than 'poorly written' and accidentally confusing. if you are the type of person that cannot accept a movie for what it is, rather than what it isn't---than you might not like this movie given the tone it sets from the beginning, and then fairly quickly departs from, and subsequently ABANDONS.worse, if you are the type of person who will engage, let alone pester, your friends about what suspenseful turn the movie will take , you should not go see this movie at all. you will be a nuisance watching a pleasant trip of inherent nonsense.",Inherent Vice
311,Vivi4,A waste of time,3,21 September 2015,"I really wanted to like this film but I didn't. It has many good actors in it, and their acting does not disappoint. The storyline, however, did not captivate me and I became disinterested quickly. The plot (if there is one), falls flat very quickly and I found that it never kept me interested. I am left to wonder why so many big names would choose to be part of this movie. A good point about the movie was that it did portray the reality of the 70's with drug induced worlds of the hippie generation. Unfortunately, there are so many characters in this film that I was left empty and not caring about any of them. The movie was also too long, well over two hours, and I kept looking at my watch in anticipation of the end.",Inherent Vice

But Inherent Vice is different. It's overly long , slow dialogue and it was hard to get into it. The cast and the performances are perfect though and I loved the style of the film. This isn't for everyone. Most people will find it a bit boring (like me) but I kinda enjoyed the last hour or so. And others will love it and praise it. 7/10 (too long , slow , not enough is going on to keep my interest) I still suggest to watch it and decide for yourself if you like it or not.",Inherent Vice
313,dpc1192,One of my favorite films.,10,13 March 2016,"I absolutely love this movie. I love the characters, I love the cinematography, I love the story, I love Doc, I love Bigfoot. I love everything about it. If you aren't into progressive filmmaking this isn't a story for you. It is one you have to follow, and one that flows in a manner and feels as if you're in a dream or a haze of marijuana smoke. PT Anderson is a master filmmaker and this movie is not getting the recognition it deserves. It did win the ROBERT ALTMAN AWARD at the INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AWARDS though and that was well deserved. I'm only 24, so maybe the older generation do not feel the connection to the film that I do. I'd rate P.T. Anderson's films as follows. 1. There Will Be Blood 2. Inherent Vice 3. Magnolia 4. Boogie Nights 5. Punch Drunk Love 6.
