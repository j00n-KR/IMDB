0,TheLittleSongbird,Nothing marginal here,9,13 May 2019,"With such a fascinating subject matter, not an area of expertise of mine and some of it does go over my head as a result but it is an interesting and still surprisingly relevant one, and such a great cast (Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Jeremy Irons, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto), there would be no reason for me to not watch 'Margin Call'.Luckily was not disappointed by 'Margin Call' at all, seeing it for the first time earlier this year, and there is nothing marginal about it. Actually consider it one of the better films from 2011 but also sadly one of the ones that isn't seen or appreciated enough. It is talk-heavy and is not rapid fire in pace, which are two things that some find problems watching films. This is including myself sometimes dependent on the execution of the rest of the film, most of the time neither are a problem, and that is the case with 'Margin Call'. It still manages to be assured, surprisingly well made for a film debut and made in such little time on a less than lavish budget, superbly acted and written and makes one want to know more about the subject.As said, was really surprised at how good the production values were. The odd occasional choppiness in editing, but very stylish still and effectively claustrophobic when necessary, which gave it real atmosphere. It is amazing that 'Margin Call' was shot in less than three weeks yet is another strong example of a film that looks much better than most films made on a bigger budget and in much longer time. The music is used sparingly but fits subtly, which makes the intensity of the dialogue and actors crackle even more. Much preferred that to constant bombast that we hear a lot these days.'Margin Call' is a superbly written film. It is talk-heavy, but done in a way that's tight as well as intelligent and thought-provoking. A big example is the big boardroom scene, with John Tuld's dialogue being chilling in its truth, few other scenes from any film that year made such a strong impact in that way. The ""it's just money"" scene is just as great for the same reason. The story is deliberate and quiet, but still gripping. Making a potentially convoluted subject accessible while getting to the point and nitty gritty without sugar-coating.It is very hard to believe that this was JC Chandor's debut feature film as director, particularly telling in some of the most gripping yet also nuanced character interactions, not just through dialogue but also through gestures and body language, for any film seen by me this year. Again the boardroom scene is a prime example, where it is easy to see that Tuld is not someone to mess with or get on the wrong side of, a scene where only Sam seems half-comfortable talking to without quaking in their shoes. The characters are well-rounded and one of the year's best ensemble casts (not a large one) all give never less than fine performances. Including Demi Moore, who is usually not a favourite of mine but plays her part coolly.Kevin Spacey commands the screen beautifully and is movingly conflicted and sincere, found myself rooting for him and his chemistry with Irons is another instance of gripping and nuanced character interaction. Stanley Tucci is very good in fairly limited screen time, while enthusiastic Zachary Quinto and oily Paul Bettany are also more than up to the task, Quinto even being quite excellent. Jeremy Irons gives a masterclass of only being in the film for less than 20 minutes or so and managing to steal the show from under the rest of the cast (including Spacey, a rare occurance). With the best lines that are chilling in their truth and painful in their honesty, how he says them also play a large part in their impact (i.e. ""it wasn't brains that got me here"" or ""do you?"" or particularly ""so that we may survive"") he plays a shark of a character with scary subtlety, even a sideway glance tells a lot.Very little to criticise here. Did feel that the ending was a bit mawkish and didn't gel with the rest of the film. And as deeply felt her performance was, it was not right to give Mary McDonnell so little to do.Otherwise, a great film with some of the actors giving some of the best work of their careers (especially Spacey and Irons, in one of not enough roles of the past 20 or so years to properly do justice to his talent). 9/10",Margin Call
1,bkoganbing,"Easy credit, difficult times",7,23 January 2015,"Now having seen Margin Call and read some reviews on it I have slightly different take on the film. It certainly is about corporate greed and the efforts to stave off doomsday for this particular investment house. But as CEO Jeremy Irons points out there is a culture of greed out there, people want to get rich quick and think that the easy way is just make the right investments and you zoom into the good life. That's a notion that took hold in the 1980s and we've not divested ourselves from it.The firm is downsizing and one of those let go is long time employee Stanley Tucci. He's not in sales, he's a number cruncher and a financial prophet of sorts. Tucci is working on something and gives a computer disc to one of the bright young men in his office Zachary Quinto and tells him to finish the project.Quinto burns the midnight oil and finds this firm has overextended itself giving easy credit on mortgages. That's the cause for a midnight meeting of the top brass where such various folks as Irons, Kevin Spacey, Demi Moore, Simon Baker try to figure out how to dump a lot of junk without panicking the market. Implicit in the discussions who gets to take the fall for bad investment policies.Margin Call is based on the happenings in a real investment house before the financial collapse of 2008. I was disappointed that the name of Glass-Steagall the New Deal measure that split investment and savings banking was not mentioned. It is widely believed that its repeal during the Clinton administration, passed with gusto by the GOP Congress and signed by Bill Clinton is the result of the orgy of speculation that led to the crash. Without other New Deal reforms in place the crash might have signalled another Great Depression. It was bad enough as is.Performance wise I would have to say that Kevin Spacey was the best a decent man in a dog eat dog profession who wants to do the right thing with the least amount of hurt for people. Quinto, the Cassandra of the piece is also good, wondering what his future might be. He may be brilliant but that didn't help Cassandra either, no one likes the bearer of bad tidings.Margin Call is a fine film that explains the financial problems easy enough for the average viewer to understand what is happening. How frightening is it that our lives are in the hands of irresponsible financial speculators.",Margin Call
2,SnoopyStyle,Great actors but limited tension,6,25 October 2013,"A financial investment company is facing possible meltdown as they face bank breaking write downs of their securities. As the discovery of the risk spreads, all the company men/woman scramble to save the company and their own jobs.The list of great actors is quite impressive. They all work brilliantly as an ensemble. Nobody is really a standout only because everybody does a good job. I wish that they had more interest material to work with.This is a minimalist style movie. It's not only the setting, but also everything else. There's just isn't anything eye opening. The story of financial meltdown has been raked over with a fine tooth comb. We all known how this thing is ending. There's no surprises here. The only way to do this story is to do the REAL story. This is no more than an imitation of the real thing.",Margin Call
3,Hitchcoc,Spacey and Irons at Their Best,9,19 September 2012,"Next to our current political mess, the world of high finance is probably the thing our country should be most worried about. Whenever a superhero in a movie ""saves the world,"" I always wonder if the world ever knew the danger it was in. This is a movie about danger and what can happen when people take chances with other people's money. There are no superheroes here. What there is is a great deal of angst and surprise that they have found themselves in this mess. They begin by whistling past the graveyard. The solution is to do something unprecedented and dangerous. Morality and loyalty go out the window and they all must face the consequences of their decisions, good or bad. I won't spoil anything here. I just want you to view to really fine actors at their best in an intellectual drama: Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons. The frightening thing is that these are the prototypes of the people playing fast and loose with our 401K's. it always amazes me that one political aim is to hand back power to big business and get government out of its wheelhouse. Has anyone noticed that these are the people behind the failures in the early 2000's. Calling Dr. Fox. Your hen house is ready!",Margin Call
4,Prismark10,The house of cards collapses,7,8 July 2014,"Margin Call is a disaster film, however its not an earthquake or a ship sinking but financial meltdown over the course of the night and the following day.The film starts when a Risk Management bigwig is fired and gives his subordinate (Zachary Quinto) information that shows impending doom at the firm which is financially overstretched.This information causes chaos amongst the senior executives with a series of crisis meetings until the big boss of the firm (Jeremy Irons) arrives late at night by helicopter. They decide to hold a fire sale and get rid of the toxic assets quickly and then crash and burn the US economy.The film is a talky, JC Chandor's script can be dense even though it tries to be accessible to the layperson as it features characters in crisis meetings and facing angst and dilemmas.The addition of Kevin Spacey brings to mind the film Glengarry Glen Ross and he also seems to be the moral counterpoint to Iron's character who even after the crisis sees an opportunity to make money in the near future.The acting is uniformly good, the film has almost a stage setting, the script is a gift for serious actors who want to perform. The standout is Jeremy Irons giving a magisterial guest star performance.",Margin Call
5,nogodnomasters,I DON'T HEAR THE MUSIC,10,9 December 2018,"I saw a Kevin Spacey interview where he claims the practices in ""Margin Call"" are still going on today. This review contains some early plot synopsis for those who may have some trouble with the Wall Street jargon. The film appears to be about a fictional investment firm at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.The drama opens with an investment bank downsizing. An outside agency has been hired to do the layoffs. We see sad scenes of people being tapped and escorted out. This company laid off much of its middle level management layers and kept the worker bees. Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), a big boss is visibly upset. He has a bottle of Pepto-Bismo on his desk. His Chocolate Lab is dying. Spacey is spending $1,000 a day to keep his dog alive. While he appears to be reviving his role in ""Horrible Bosses"" we later find out he is our closest thing to a good guy.One of the laid off mid-level bosses, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) hands off a thumb drive to Seth Bregman (Zachary Quinto) who burns the midnight oil going over the data. Bregman panics at the numbers. The volatility index (VI) indicates the company will incur losses that will greatly exceed its total assets. The firm goes into panic mode. The company holds bad assets known as derivatives which is nothing more than pieces of various risk mortgages lumped together. If they attempt to dump them all, without buying, people will suspect something is up and won't buy their assets. If they wait too long to dump them, the fear is someone else will figure out what is going on and beat them to the punch. They are between the proverbial ""rock and a hard place.""This sets the wheels in motion as the CEO is notified that the company may collaspe.Penn Badgley views their job as legalized gambling. They make $250,000 a year crunching numbers and think their bosses who make $2.5 million a year are obscenely overpaid. Jeremy Irons plays the stereotypical CEO who doesn't seem knowledgeable about their product.Now in spite of the fact this is dealing with issues beyond most people's lives, everyone one of us knows the results of an economy crash. The actors did a superb job holding our interest in the film as each person handles the stress differently.What will the investment firm do to survive? As things get ugly, the drama becomes more interesting.F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Rare film that has strippers and Demi Moore in which she is not one of them.",Margin Call
6,kosmasp,the unofficial wall street sequel,9,8 September 2011,"While I am a big fan of Oliver Stone and I did enjoy his second Wall Street movie, I have to admit, that this one is superior in every way. Great acting talent at hand, great (unfortunately) real story, which might be a bit heightened for obvious reasons, but still very scary if you think about the whole thing.As stated above the actors make a big difference. They have to convey decisions and stand by things that you shouldn't normally do. But then again it's not as if this didn't happen (one way or the other). The movie also seems to have affected people since its original slated release date got pushed forward. Festival releases (where I saw it too) and the general good response made that an easy decision. Watching this should be one too ...",Margin Call
7,classicsoncall,"""When all is said and done, they do not lose money.""",9,11 May 2014,"This film, in brief, is the story of the 2008 financial crisis told in it's most simplistic form. Extrapolate the results out to thousands of small brokerage houses around the country and you get a sense of how the trickle down of worthless paper made it's way to the least suspecting investment houses who were left holding the bag on non performing sub-prime mortgages along with other asset classes. ""It's just money. It's made up, pieces of paper with pictures on it..."" is the way one of the principals describes it near the end of the picture. The story goes on to show just how ruthless and amoral the top executives of these firms can be, and how a 'good guy' like Sam (Kevin Spacey) can get sucked into a situation over which he has no control, other than play the game out to it's inevitable conclusion or quit, thereby forfeiting everything he's worked for up till now. It's basically the one per-cent guys sticking it to fellow one per-cent guys knowing that they'll have to pay an industry price for the deception at some point, but not before they get out by the skin of their teeth. In the end, the secret to the firm's dubious success, 'Be first, be smarter, or cheat' was pretty well demonstrated by doing all three.",Margin Call
8,lee_eisenberg,economic meltdown caused by cold corporate world,8,19 April 2012,"J.C. Chandor's ""Margin Call"" is a perfect movie for the era of the financial crisis. It depicts the inner workings of an unnamed investment bank -- it could be Bear Stearns or Goldman Sachs or Lehman Brothers -- on the verge of the economic meltdown. After the risk management director gets laid off, he gives the new man a USB and tells him to be careful. It turns out that the company has been relying too much on mortgage-backed securities, meaning that it's risking bankruptcy.Of course, the movie's main point is how cold, unfeeling and amoral the people in this environment are. The bosses have no qualms about selling the toxic assets, as in fact happened in real life. But as much as the movie says about corporate executives, it also says something about us as a society. What kind of a society lets people get away with these things? Even if the movie isn't a masterpiece, it's still one that everyone should see. These Wall Street types get to live like kings while millions are out of work and often homeless. Really good one.""When you can't pay your mortgage, you're a deadbeat. When you can't pay a million mortgages, you're Bear Stearns and we bail you out."" - Bill Maher",Margin Call
9,jboothmillard,Margin Call,6,5 August 2017,"I knew this film was something to do with business, but I did remember seeing a television review for it, I must have forgotten the time during which it is set, so I was certainly hoping it would be interesting, written and directed by J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost, A Most Violent Year). Basically set in 2008, during a 24-hour period, at an unnamed respected a Wall Street investment bank, the financial company is forced into downsizing. Among the key players let go is head of risk management Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), following his departure junior risk analyst Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) works late into the night to finish Dale's project. Sullivan discovers the company's financial disaster, due to excessive leverage, the company's assets could decrease rapidly and the firm will go bankrupt, what follows will turn from panicking to double-checking and double-dealing. Sullivan and fellow junior analyst Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley) tell their desk head Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) about the situation, he alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), they attempt to contact Dale, with no luck. The senior executives include division head Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), and finally CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), they will do whatever it takes to lessen the force of intensity in this debacle. A series of meetings occur throughout the night, as the news travels up through the ranks, but whatever decisions are made in terms of staff cuts and all business matters, they will have effects and consequences both morally and financially. Also starring Penn Badgley as Seth Bregman and Mary McDonnell as Mary Rogers. The performances by the all-star cast are all great, and the script is full of lots of technical dialogue I honestly don't understand, I certainly don't understand all the components that lead to the 2008 financial crisis, but this is a good story, making the characters humanised, and it feels claustrophobic, all in all it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Good!",Margin Call
10,rmax304823,Caution: Pragmatists at Work.,7,22 February 2014,"This above-average production got some negative review -- ""dull,"" ""boring,"" ""no climax"", and so forth -- and I can see why. Nobody's head gets wrenched off.First of all, what a cast! Kevin Spacey is the audience proxy, a high-echelon man at a investment firm who is torn between two or three conflicting impulses. Jeremy Irons is the bull dog in charge of the firm. Demi Moore is a Risk Manager who gets the ax. Stanley Tucci is the man who uncovers the firm's secret. Simon Baker is the tool of the corporation. (He's the likable young actor whose dead body is discovered by Detective Kevin Spacey in ""L.A. Confidential."") But then everybody does a pretty good job.Being, as I am, a complete ignoramus when it comes to high finance -- or finance generally -- I kind of enjoy movies about investment firms that are structured for the simple minded. ""Wall Street"" was a nice easy ride. I could understand everything that happened in ""Wall Street"" so it must have been a stupid movie. This one is made for adults, and I wouldn't argue that the writer/director, J. C. Chandor, has exactly oversimplified the plot.It's a fictionalized tale of the near collapse of Wall Street in 2008. A young employee discovers that the firm owns a lot of ""MBS""s. That acronym is never spelled out but as the story progressed I managed to figure out that it stands for ""mortgage-backed securities."" These are known to the public, which does not grasp them in their entirety, as ""toxic mortgages."" It's determined that if the firm holds onto its MBSs, it will lose more money than the firm is worth. All the bosses are called in because this is a big decision. What to do? Should the firm hold the MBSs and go bankrupt when the public discovers what the firm already knows? Or should they dump the MBSs on the market quickly, for whatever they can get, before word about their toxicity gets around? Spacey argues that if they dump the offal on the market, they'll be screwing all their old customers and they'll no longer be a respectable firm, although they may survive financially by getting the drop on other firms who haven't yet twigged to the coming disaster. Irons goes around promising multi-million dollars bonuses to traders who will dump at least 93% of the garbage. Of course, the firm is so monstrous that once they start selling, all the other firms will realize something is up, and they'll sell their MBSs too and -- well, you know what happened.The film is deliberately paced so it seems slow at times. Men and women sit around in business suits talking. But what they're discussing is an economic calamity so the subject assumes a kind of importance.Both Irons and Spacey turn in impressive and tense performances. They both look older and Spacey's features are becoming lumpy but I see that happening to everyone as they age, except me. His attitude towards a role is to play it quiet and straight, and then every once in a while, do some bit of business with his voice or his face that lift it entirely out of the ordinary. In ""L. A. Confidential,"" there were two unimpeachable lines delivered. ""All right, I'll do it,"" and, ""Loo-tenant."" Here, it's when he asks Irons a simple question about a malodorous idea that Irons has just brought up: ""What?"" Irons is his equal, and in one scene, on a balcony, during a private conversation, the photographer has caught him in a kick light that turns his face into a multitude of evil creases and lines.The viewer has to pay attention. Not to any particular exchange but to the unrolling of the whole story. But it's worth the effort. And there's not a car chase in sight.",Margin Call
11,blanche-2,love that cast,7,14 September 2013,"A terrific cast highlights ""Margin Call,"" a 2011 film by a then new director, J.C. Chandor, who also wrote this film. He's assembled a great group to tell his story: Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Zachary Quinto, Will Bettany, Simon Baker, Demi Moore, and Penn Badgley.The movie starts with big changes taking place in a financial firm, with Eric Dake (Stanley Tucci) being let go. As he's leaving, he hands a jump drive to one of the young men under him, Peter Sullivan (Quinto) and tells him to look it over and ""be careful."" Peter looks it over later that night, all right, panics, and calls another associate, Seth (Badgley) and asks him to return to the office and bring their boss, Will (Bettany) who is drinking in the same nightclub.Peter, and Seth before him, has discovered that their volatility assumptions in their MBS portfolio are false, something that can destroy their company. They have a huge pile of assets worth much less than they thought. Selling them off will possibly hurt the firm's reputation and the personal reputation of some of the brokers. But they have to do something.A huge meeting is called, with John Tuld (Irons), the head of the entire concern, coming in on a helicopter with another bigshot, Cohen (Baker) as they try to decide what to do.I just loved the entire cast, but not being a broker, and being someone who just by buying one share of stock seems to bring down large companies and cause the market to crash, the scariness of all this was sort of lost on me. Intellectually I understood their panic, but emotionally I couldn't get into it. The most compelling part for me was the beginning, with a security guard escorting Tucci into his office to clean out his desk. Anyone in a corporation who has ever witnessed this or been victim of the firing process - your voice mail gone, your log-in no good, your phone cut off - knows how humiliating that is.The whole cast is wonderful. Quinto is excellent as a young man who stumbles on something, is rather dazed by it, and tries to stay calm, while Badgley's character flips out - the two play well together. My favorite was Irons as a charming, eloquent, take-charge guy - you know exactly what he has the job he does. Spacey's character, going through a personal crisis, is unsure and doesn't like the decision made but puts on a brave face. Everyone is great and each character is well defined, because you can really see the mettle of people when they're in a crisis.On that basis, this is a good movie, and if you know a lot about finances and brokerages, or were involved in the crash of 2008, you will love it. I was involved in both the 1987 and the 2008 crash - both times, I entered the market with a few bucks.",Margin Call

This was needed for people who aren't savvy in the investment world. If anything, we were taught by this film to be very careful and knowledgeable before you get into stocks, particularly marginal buying.Jeremy Irons as the chief executor of the firm came across that it's all right to literally screw people.We saw downsizing at the film's beginning and then the general panic set in when disclosures reveal a very troubled company.As Robertson, Demi Moore was perfectly cast. A cold- hearted individual, she was a real company lady to the fullest extent.In the case of Zachary Quinto, it showed that being at the right place at the right time with the right answers, and you shall go very far.Another good performance by Kevin Spacey as the 34 year veteran of the firm, essentially a yes-man to the Irons character.",Margin Call

C. Chandor takes place at an investment firm during the first few hours of the upcoming financial crisis back in 2008.An entry-level financial analyst completed a work of a senior analyst Eric Dale,who was just laid off together with many others from a financial firm, found an information that found it necessary for the company to liquidate its resources.This leads to many decisions from the firm's higher ups to make decisions overnight as to do the necessary actions needed to stay afloat and to lay more people off from the company.This is definitely one thought provoking film that realistically highlights the events that happened during the early hours of the financial crisis in 2008.It provides us an overview of how financial analysts and financial firms particularly the higher ups make decisions to stay afloat.Also,we get to see different characters with moral backgrounds as to how they deal with actions taken.Despite the fact that the film somehow ended abruptly and the lack of tension it provides as many of the events happen through the conversation of the characters,it nevertheless provides the viewer of a great movie about the impact of the meltdown on a company and the lives of the employees working.",Margin Call

The writer-director tries to create the impression that there are moral issues at stake, but there are none. It does, however, go some way to showing how unimportant investment banks and the like are in broader society, how their importance is vastly overstated, the obscene amounts they play with and how trivial the lives of their staff are to the company.Great performances from an all-star cast, esp Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons.

16,Boba_Fett1138,"A really good movie to watch, even while I couldn't always understand what was going on with its story.",7,15 February 2012,"It was only a matter of time of course, that these movies about the current financial crisis would erupt out of the ground and this is probably one of the very first ones that tries to go all the way back and show how it all started at one day.But don't expect to learn much though. If the whole financial crisis talk sounded like a bunch of mumbo jumbo talk to you, it still will be so after watching this movie. This movie mostly consists out of a bunch of people looking at a computer screen or some sheets of paper and talking about a whole bunch of numbers with each other. I'm sure that somebody could make a very funny montage out of this, if there isn't one already. No, I definitely couldn't understand absolutely everything in this movie but strangely enough this didn't mattered all that much.Reason why the movie still works out really well is because all of the actors still manage to get the sense of pure panic and despair across, when they learn that the way they have been operating will cause the financial market to crash, in only a matter of days. You could definitely say that this is a real actors movie and the foremost reason why I still could enjoy this movie so much.It's certainly not like watching paint dry. Despite of its subject, this by no means is a boring or uninteresting movie to watch, even when you don't understand what is going on exactly. And this is a real big accomplishment, especially when you also consider that director J.C. Chandor had never directed a full length movie, prior to this one. He probably most likely did had some experience already in the theater world, which would also explain why he handles the actors in this movie so well.Yes, this movie is really made great by its actors, which might not be a big surprise to you, when you see its cast list. Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, Stanley Tucci. A true dream cast, for any filmmaker. And basically everybody is giving a fine performance and all are playing very well off each other. It's a very talkative movie, so this movie truly stood or fell with its actor's deliveries and performances. But this was obviously a movie all involved with believed in and they truly gave everything they had, which, needless to say, really payed off well.It's really a good movie to watch, even when its subject or premise doesn't sound all that interesting to you. Give it a try! Chances are you won't regret it.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Margin Call
17,evanston_dad,"The Rich Get Richer, Damn Them",9,3 February 2012,"A terrific film that dramatizes the events leading up to the most recent financial meltdown.A cast of middling to great actors all give excellent performances in a movie so terse and devoid of histrionics that it feels almost like a documentary. Taking place over one long dark night of the soul, a group of Wall Street suits, ranging from peons to muckety-mucks, come to the slow realization that their company is about to fold and that the only way to stem the blood flow is to liquidate most of the company's assets, thereby setting off the market crash that they know will bring the global economy down low. The various characters have greater to lesser feelings of guilt about this -- Jeremy Irons and Paul Bettany get a couple of dog-eat-dog speeches, while Kevin Spacey and Zachary Quinto serve as the film's moral conscience -- but really no one person's opinion matters much in the face of a steam engine charging out of control.""Margin Call"" takes a very resigned tone to the whole episode. It doesn't really ask its audience to leap to their feet in rage at the way the casual actions of a few can so seriously harm the many, but rather to simply accept that the disgustingly rich will always be rich at the sake of those who are not. The consolation is that these disgustingly rich people don't seem especially happy or fulfilled; the strive for material wealth seems to lead nowhere but to a strive for even more material wealth. That that kind of lifestyle leaves people hollowed out is made abundantly clear in the film's final image.The cast also includes Simon Baker, Demi Moore and Stanley Tucci, all of them at the top of their game.Grade: A",Margin Call
18,ferguson-6,Fixing a Hole,7,22 October 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. It is absolutely understandable if you have reached your limit for dissecting and analyzing the 2008 financial crisis. However, if you can't get enough, or are still trying to find someone to blame for looting half your retirement plan, this film offers a different perspective and one that proves more personal.Hopefully you saw ""Inside Job"", a fine documentary that provided an overview of the collapse. HBO's ""Too Big To Fail"" gave us a glimpse inside the Fed's decision making process during the crisis. This movie narrows the focus down to a singular investment bank. Writer/Director JC Chandor serves up a dramatized story that begins with massive layoffs. We see the hatchet crew arriving replete with security escorts, as high paid executives are led out to the sidewalk. Stanley Tucci plays a middle manager in the Risk-Analysis department. As he is headed to the curb, he hands a flash drive to one of his young analysts (Zachary Quinto) and tells him to finish it and ""be careful"".Flash forward a few hours and the surviving staff heads out for celebratory drinks while Quinto's character starts churning away on Tucci's formula. Once he realizes that the risk formulas on MBS (mortgage backed securities) have threatened the stability of the firm, he places an emergency call. It is quite interesting to see how this emergency escalates as we are introduced, one rung at a time, to the hierarchy within the firm ... Paul Bettany, Kevin Spacey, Demi Moore, Simon Baker. This culminates in a late night conference room meeting when the CEO (Jeremy Irons) arrives by helicopter.There are so many facets to this story. We see how some are in the game for money. Penn Badgley says it's all he ever wanted to do, but his obsessive behavior over the income of each manager shows us why. Paul Bettany is a middle manager who realizes the ""killers"" such as Simon Baker have passed him by. Demi Moore plays the type who doesn't mind finding a fall guy, as long as it's not her. Kevin Spacey is 30+ year career man who has survived many crisis by being loyal to the firm, while also doing right by the client. Jeremy Irons is the charming, powerful CEO who laughs about being as smart as a Golden Retriever, but laser-focused on keeping the firm viable.What you can't help but notice is the number of managers who point out that they don't understand the charts and graphs and numbers, and just need someone to explain it to them in ""plain English"". We also see self-preservation at its finest/worst and the struggle that some of the characters have in deciding what is the ""right thing to do"". It is not surprising, yet frightening still, to see that the red flags were flying before anyone acknowledged their presence.When the CEO says the three ways to win are to: ""be first, be smartest or cheat"", we realize huge decisions are made only in the best interest of the firm ... not the economy, and certainly not an individual investor. Although this investment firm remains nameless through the film, I did find it interesting that Irons' character name is John Tuld. John Tuld ... Dick Fuld ... Just sayin'",Margin Call
19,phd_travel,"Superb balanced, realistic and engrossing from start to finish.",10,30 December 2011,"This movie is even better than the ratings and reviews. There is definitely a place for this movie among the recent financial crisis films. It's not similar to like ""Wall Street 2"" which was a bit preachy and melodramatic at times nor was it a documentary like ""Too Big To Fail"". Instead it is a balanced insight into the professionals working in the industry at the midst of the financial meltdown. The characters were realistic - no bad guys or good guys - even Jeremy Irons character was just a CEO faced with a choice between a rock and a hard place he had to make the choice as the boss not just a greedy villain.There are many well observed realisms woven into the dialog. The dialog was well written especially Paul Bettany consoling Penn Badgley. Another thing was Jeremy Iron's explaining to Kevin Spacey at the end why they had to do why they did - there were many financial crises throughout the years. The only thing wrong with the dialog is there were too many expletives that made it seem to be trying to be too dramatic at times. It was nice to see how the often discussed high salaries that they made in good times in fact weren't that much as in Paul Bettany's character who had to give up half to taxes, pay his mortgage, give his parents something and set aside some for a rainy day which can come anytime in finance. The layoffs of Stanley Tucci and others especially Penn Badgley's illustrate how temporary many financial jobs are. It is good to see on screen that the average employee of a financial firm is just an average executive who isn't making millions - only a handful of CEOs are. Kevin Spacey's divorce (the price he paid for his career?) and isolation at the end was touching. There is the usual comparison between building something (a bridge in Tucci's case) and what they were doing in finance. The cast is excellent. Kevin Spacey is really good you can feel his frustration. Jeremy Irons has stature. Paul Bettany may have been a bit too South London hooligan instead of a wall street British expat. Penn is okay as the young analyst. Demi was a bit glam for a lady in her field but it's a movie and who else could have fit this hard nosed corporate role? Zachary Quinto does the nerd who is good at numbers quite well his 'not quite on the same plane' genius demeanour was right on. The faults were small an I understand they had to make things dramatic for a movie. First of all hedge fund MBS traders and executives mostly don't wear suits in New York anymore. But it had to look more glamorous so I understand. Secondly all the late night action was for dramatic purposes - in real life they would have waited for the morning. One thing is that I would have liked to see a bit more of the day of the meltdown and the aftermath instead of most on the night before. But the night time setting did make things more tense and urgent. One last thing the title - the company wasn't really margin called but I guess it's more catchy. Overall a fascinating must watch for anyone interested in the recent financial crisis.",Margin Call
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Margin Call,10,20 December 2011,"It played out like a fish bowl experiment with the myriad of characters all mixed together in primarily a single setting of an office, beginning with major corporate layoffs for the bottom line to look good, and Stanley Tucci's Eric Dale happened to be one of many given their unceremonious marching orders. But before he made his final way out, he handed over his uncompleted current task to junior staffer Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto who also served as one of the film's producers) who had worked all night to try and unravel what Eric's parting shot of ""Be Careful"" was all about. And lo and behold, the discovery that the company is sitting on a financial time bomb, becomes the catalyst for escalation and crisis management over the next 12 hours.Which opens up the floor to the brilliance of Kevin Spacey to expand upon his role as head of sales who is about to address a conflict of conscience against a bloodbath waiting to unfold no thanks to decisions set by bigwigs such as securities chief Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), head of risk Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), legal counsel Ramesh Shah (Aasif Mandvi) and CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), some caught offguard, while others knowingly aware of the road bumps, and trying to rally and consolidate for advantageous positions, which you know just how the rich can get richer, and the poor not knowing just what had hit them.Unlike the toxic assets which were the cause of the firm's impending doomsday scenario, Margin Call the film is built upon the foundation of a solid story and a solid cast, paced to allow you to think about implications and the gravity of the situation at hand, that can be extrapolated to just about any serious crisis any company in any industry can face. It's about doing what's ethical versus doing what may be, as a key character puts it, first past the post, the smarter thing to do, or just plain cheating just to ensure basic survival of the fittest, ethics be damned. It's at times a morality tale, and one that holds up the mirror against ourselves, and society at large in general.Executives aren't where they are without stepping on a lot of toes, and the film doesn't make any apologies for its characters' behaviours in the cut-throat world of business, and especially when their numbers chasing contribute directly to their ladder climbing potential, and the fat paychecks and bonuses awarded at the end of a successful year. Little moments in the film stem from incidents in life you'd come to identify with, such as disbelief at the incredulous salaries and perks banking executives draw, and what they actually stand to gain in whichever way the market moves, even with things that will irk such as how Wall Street has the cheek to reward itself despite the debacle created. Margin Call the film epitomizes these issues and more through its many layers.What I thoroughly enjoyed about the film is to say so much without having to go through most of the dry, minute details that only rocket scientists could understand, and that's precisely how the world got into one of the messiest financial tsunamis just exactly because nobody bothers about the nitty gritties, but gotten seduced by the big picture potential, and I mean potential, of what could be the size of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It is this corrupting system that the planners and risk managers know how to package and sell, that the greedy and gullible accept wholeheartedly, hook, line and sinker. It mirrors real life so vividly and accurately that it's really scary, cutting so close to the bone how schemes can actually be poisonous to the layman.Chandor also nailed it accurately on the different layers of staff and management in a corporation, where you have the rank and file really employed for their skill sets and are the Ivy Leaguers, the middle managers and number crunchers who have to manage them, knowing just enough to milk and motivate the best of minds, and those who live at the top of the food chain in board rooms who can only deal with, and have time for, simplified watered down summaries on the basis of which to make their decisions. Which worked for the film in witnessing how different levels react with the issue at hand. Any working adult will lightly chuckle at the absurdity of it all and will not find a lack of choices to plop in their real life counterparts into the multi-faceted roles here.Should you be keen in a ""shit hitting the fan"" narrative film after recent local debacles involving our transportation system, then Margin Call, even though belonging to a vastly different industry, would be that choice at the cinemas. In essence the crisis decision making, the scapegoats and the likes are all up there on screen, except of course in real life the personas may not always be that engaging, though its impact equally as far reaching across all segments of society.It's a late entry of the year by the time it hits our shores, but it's definitely saving one of the best that this year had to offer since premiering in Sundance at the beginning of the year. Making a film about the financial industry and doing so on the relative cheap may be an oxymoron, but Margin Call just proved that it can be done, convincingly, engagingly, and enjoyably. It's forcing its way into my top 10 of the year, and is for sure, highly recommended.",Margin Call
21,Mr-Fusion,"Even with an amazing cast, the screenplay is the real marvel",7,16 June 2014,"To its great credit, ""Margin Call"" makes the jargon and highly technical nature of the investment industry graspable, and it really speaks to the film's writing that a series of scenes in high-rise offices and boardrooms can be so riveting. Boasting a killer ensemble cast, it all goes down in a 24-hour period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Kevin Spacey's the highlight of this whole thing, even if he's the least sociopathic in a cast of pretty despicable characters. That so much money could be made hand over fist so recklessly – and the cord so easily cut when the business model becomes toxic . . . it's compelling stuff and hits close to home; more so to those who were directly affected by the crisis, but the film's captures the unease and anxieties felt by everyone during those horrifying crisis days.7/10",Margin Call
22,JamesHitchcock,Desperate Diseases,7,2 October 2014,"When I was a student at Cambridge during the early eighties I was surprised to discover that not all my contemporaries shared my love of the institution at which we were studying. Some disparaged it as an ""ivory tower"" and compared it unfavourably with the so-called ""real world"" in which they hoped to be earning a lucrative salary once they had completed the tedious formality of obtaining their degrees. This tendency seemed particularly pronounced among those students, generally from wealthy backgrounds, who hoped to make their living in the financial institutions of the City. When the Crash of 1987 came, a few years after we had left college, I remember thinking that this demonstrated that my contemporaries had been wrong and that the world of high finance, with its casino economics, was far more unreal than the world inhabited by the most other-worldly Cambridge academic.The year 1987 also saw the release of ""Wall Street"", perhaps Hollywood's most famous exploration of the financial world, although it does not deal with the Crash but with the boom years that preceded it, years which have become known (from the film's best-known line) as the ""greed is good"" era. ""Margin Call"" is a ""Wall Street"" for the 21st century, an examination of the Crash of 2008, a far worse crisis than that of 1987.The action takes place in a large Wall Street investment bank on the eve of the Crash. (This bank is a fictitious institution, although the events depicted do mirror events at some real banks during this time). After arriving for work one morning, Eric Dale, a senior risk analyst, is informed that he is being made redundant as part of an immediate mass layoff, despite his nineteen years of service to the firm. Dale tries to protest that he is currently working on something important, but is hustled out of the door. Before leaving, however, he manages to pass a memory stick to a junior colleague, Peter Sullivan, telling him to ""be careful"".When Sullivan looks at Dale's work, he is horrified by what he discovers. Dale has realised that the bank owns an excessive number of sub-prime mortgage-backed securities which are virtually worthless, not so much securities as insecurities. A drop in the market, which given its current volatile state is almost certain to happen before long, could leave the bank dangerously over-exposed, with potentially disastrous consequences. Sullivan informs his superior Will Emerson of his findings; Emerson realises the seriousness of the situation and the matter is referred upwards to a chain of ever more senior executives, ending with the bank's British Chief Executive John Tuld.Tuld's solution to the problem is a simple one- an immediate ""fire sale"" to dispose of the firm's toxic assets before the rest of the market cottons on to just how toxic they are. Sam Rogers, the bank's Head of Sales and Trading, objects on both ethical and practical grounds; if the bank disposes of worthless assets under what are effectively false pretences it will gain a reputation for untrustworthiness and destroy its relationship with its trading partners. Tuld's response is that desperate diseases require desperate remedies; the alternative to the ""fire sale"" is that the bank will probably collapse. He is not worried by the effect this will have on the rest of the financial sector or on the wider American economy; indeed, he positively welcomes the prospect of an economic slump, knowing that an astute financier can turn this to his advantage just as much as a boom.Nearly all the action takes place in gleaming, sterile chrome-and-glass skyscraper offices high above the streets of New York. The natural world is almost totally excluded. The characters, inhabitants not so much of an ivory tower as of a glass one, are separated from the ""real world"" by several hundred feet, and this physical separation symbolises their moral isolation from that world; they either do not know, or do not care, how their actions will affect the lives of the men and women below them. The artificiality of their world is emphasised by the film's drab palette of colours, dominated by black, grey, beige and dark blues.The film features a strong ensemble cast, all of whom play their parts well. Special mentions should go to Demi Moore, proving that she can be a serious actress as well as a sex symbol, Kevin Spacey as Rogers, a man with more moral sense than most of his colleagues but who allows himself (reluctantly) to be dragooned into conformity by a mixture of bribes and threats, and Jeremy Irons as Tuld, less flamboyant than Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street"", but even more amoral. For Tuld greed is good, and so are duplicity, selfishness and ruthlessness provided that they serve his purposes. (Tuld has something in common with the anti-hero of another fictional treatment of the Crash of '08, John Veals in Sebastian Faulks's novel ""A Week in December"").The film received an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Original Screenplay"", and this was certainly well-deserved. Much of the dialogue consists of obscure financial jargon, and yet the plot itself never becomes obscure of difficult to follow, but remains engrossing throughout. The ending is, admittedly, a weak one, but with this exception ""Margin Call"" succeeds both as a piece of film-making and as a piece of social commentary. Hollywood rarely, if ever, attacks big business unless there is a good business reason for doing so, but this does not prevent it from occasionally making some pertinent points about modern capitalism. 7/10",Margin Call

24,KineticSeoul,Even dream jobs have nightmares,6,2 June 2012,"What this movie is a business movie, I for one don't find these types of movies all that interesting. It just feels like watching people do work and that applies to movies like ""Wall Street"". Despite those movies showing the corruption and greed in the business world. And that is what this movie is. But it shows what the firm has to deal with after letting a lot of the workers go and later faced with a financial meltdown. There is a lot of philosophical business talk which I didn't really care all that much about, but it didn't really take anything away from this movie either. The dialogue and the interaction between character is actually sort of intriguing in this, even the bickering and having a penis measuring contest with each other with who has the higher position and who makes more money. Overall when it comes to the plot it's sort of a clash between business people that are loyal and at least somewhat honest while having moral values and the business people who are only motivated by greed and it doesn't matter who they step on in order to get what they want. For a movie where the majority of the movie with business men in suit at a firm with just dialogue and good acting. It's watchable and worth at least one viewing. It's not a movie I would watch again but it was alright for a first go at it. Viewers who are very enthusiastic when it comes to watching people do business and what happens at a firm when chaos hits...Well this movie might be for you.6.8/10",Margin Call
25,Hellmant,"'People basically suck and are only looking out for themselves', I don't need a movie to try and convince me that.",6,8 November 2011,"'MARGIN CALL': Three Stars (Out of Five)Political drama/thriller about one fictional investment bank (said to be loosely based on Lehman Brothers, as well as others) over the course of a 24-hour period dealing with the events leading up to the market crash of 2007-2008. It comes from first time writer/director J.C. Chandor and was produced by actor Zachory Quinto and his production company. The film co-stars a large assortment of A list celebrities including Quinto, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Stanley Tucci, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Simon Baker and Penn Badgley. It starts out pretty compelling and interesting but leaves the viewer a little emotionally unsatisfied by film's end (at least in my case) with no real resolution, just a giant 'downer' ending but I guess that was unavoidable.The film opens with a series of mass layoffs at an unnamed large investment bank where risk management employees Peter Sullivan (Quinto) and Seth Bregman (Badgley) watch as their boss Eric Dale (Tucci) is let go. Eric was working on an important project and passes on a USB drive with his findings to Peter before he leaves. Peter continues to work on the project and discovers that their company will soon owe more money than it's worth. Peter passes on the information to his new superior Will Emerson (Bettany), a senior trader, who notifies his boss Sam Rogers (Spacey). They continue to fret and alert more senior employees until CEO John Tuld (Irons) decides they must sell everything in a day before anyone else knows it's worthless, knowing this will not only end all future business transactions of their company (due to lack of trust) but cause the entire market to crash and a resulting economy collapse. The movie mostly focuses on Sam Roger's moral conscious coping with the whole thing as well as his dog dying.Like I said the movie starts out pretty fascinating and interesting but as it goes on it doesn't really go anywhere. We already know what's going to happen to the company and the economy as a result so there's no real suspense there. What I was most interested in were the characters and their moral dilemma and I saw no satisfactory resolution with any of them. Spacey's character visibly goes through the most emotional struggles but how he comes to term with them was not really convincing other than the message that people basically suck and are only looking out for themselves, which I don't need a movie to try and convince me of. I was hoping for a more positive and uplifting outcome but the movie, like I've mentioned, is very un-climactic in that way. It was well made to a certain extent but just didn't pack enough of an emotional punch. Depressing but that's about it; darkness without any light.

But before he goes, he hands an important disc to young, high flying financial whizz kid Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) who opens it and, along with his equally young, ambitious friend Seth (Penn Badgley) discovers that the firm is in trouble and could go down very quickly if something isn't done. They turn to older, experienced consultant Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) to help them, and he becomes convinced, while everyone else thinks otherwise, that they should hold on to the companies remaining stock rather than sell it. But as pressure mounts from man at the top John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), it all builds to an explosive climax where nothing works out as it seems.Given the massive knock on, resounding effect it's had through out the world, the 2008 global recession was a topic it was only going to be a matter of time before someone made a film about, and on the face of it, who better than debut feature length director J.C. Chandor, who appears to have had a bit of history himself in the banking world working for top financial firm Merill Lynch? He manages to re-create a quite claustrophobic, atmospheric depiction of what the inner workings of a financial institution must be like, which seems to have received rave reviews from most of IMDb's other critics, despite seeming to skip a theatrical release over here (or, it seems, a much more limited one.) All the same, given the tense, seat edge results that could have been produced, the end result does feel like something of a missed opportunity.It was billed as more of a thriller than a drama, but the latter genre is the one that, detrimentally, seems to win over, resulting in a slow, pot boiling effort that seems to be lost in the financial workings and jargon it's depicting which ends up losing the viewer. It may well have been a play before it was made into a film, albeit one I've never heard of, but it certainly wouldn't be a surprise. Despite it's big name cast and ambitious concept, it can't shake a TV movie sort of feel, that only adds to it's lower endness.The performances are pretty solid, especially Spacey and Irons, as well as supporting players Demi Moore and Paul Bettany as a flash, cocky Brit trader, and it undoubtedly manages to create a tense, sterile atmosphere in the inside of this financial building, with long, lingering shots of empty corridors and scenes where lower down people like office cleaners feel as much a potential part of the action as the main players themselves. It gets a lot of things right, and all the right people, especially the director, were involved. But it would have worked better as a nail biting thriller than this slow, lingering depiction of what might have gone on behind the scenes. ***",Margin Call
28,paul2001sw-1,"Stylised, but still feels like truth",9,5 October 2014,"I like watching films like 'Rogue Trader', or, with somewhat more reservation, 'Wall Street', as much as the next man; but there's a problem with most mainstream depictions of the financial sector, in that they portray any problems that exist as essentially stemming from a few rotten eggs, not from a system that is fundamentally bad. Bankers are doubtless as repulsive as we all would be if we had their money; but the relationship between cause and effect works both ways. J.C Chandors's film 'Margin Call' is refreshing because it doesn't embrace this easy narrative: it's main characters are not especially pleasant but are still human; and are both the architects and the prisoners of their situation. The script would make a fine play: the movie is all talking heads, and what is said is slightly stylised and sharp compared with real world conversation, albeit not ludicrously so. And a distinguished cast, including Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Jeremy Irons and Paul Bettany, put in consistently on-the-mark performances.

Margin Call tells the story of a nameless banking giant in Wall Street as it's about to go under. All the major executives gather for an emergency late night meeting to discuss if there's any way out of it. That's it. The whole film is basically set in a boardroom (and a few surrounding offices) over a period of one night. The cast meets in a boardroom then leaves. We see them in twos or threes as they discuss what's already been discussed in the boardroom then return to the boardroom to discuss more.You may have guessed by now. I'm siding with the 'watching paint dry' camp.Yes, Margin call does have some great acting talent in there - Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons to name but two). However, I just found the whole film boring. Maybe you need to be more into the 'investment way of life' to appreciate it more.

The financial crisis effected millions of people, and for actors to perfectly portray the utter shock at a time like this was truly a spectacle. Some of the one on one meetings between Irons and Spacey proved to be the major highlight of the film and there were no weak spots in the cast.

Jeremy Irons makes a great villain, and his demeanor in this film gave me the deepest chills especially when he told an employee to speak to him as if he was a dog. Paul Bettany, Stanley Tucci, and Zachary Quinto make very good additions to the cast.Overall, this is an excellent film that explores the concepts of capitalism, greed, and corruption. No matter how great Oliver Stone's Wall Street films were, Margin Call was even better and perhaps a bit more realistic.

32,secondtake,"Restrained, beautiful drama about stock traders? Yes!",7,9 September 2012,"Margin Call (2011)For its overall tone and its cool interactions between well-suited business people, and for a hint at what goes on at the big brokerages in crisis, ""Margin Call"" is smart and well executed. It trades drama and suspense for more tantalizing interpersonal insight to that world. The big moment of drama when the market opens the next day is dispatched in a few overheard telephone transactions, and that's a relief. In all, it's a surprisingly balanced, measured, and sometimes too balanced and too measured movie.Cinematographer Frank DeMarco pulls off a ravishing bit of thoughtful, restrained, elegant photography throughout. In particular you'll see lots of precise focussing (those focus stops were put to exacting use here, but that requires the actors to know the blocking of their movements perfectly, too, without losing the flow of their performances). In a way, the relatively slow experience of this very Wall Street plot is sustained by the fluidity of the visuals. Keep an eye open for that. Watch some terrific out of focus backgrounds--an odd thing to be looking at but you'll see, there's time in this patient movie for letting your mind wander.The story is something you can admire for its pertinence but still wonder at some of the details--or lack of details. It started to be clear that either the writer simply didn't know the lingo or he dumbed it down for us, which had the effect of making it evasive. For example, one character might walk in on another and say, so we're doing this. The other says it's going to be ugly. The first says it's only the beginning. And so on. We know that investments have gone bad and we don't need the charts, but the vague dialog seems false. People don't talk in abstracts--except in wobbly screenplays.This generalizing weakness shows up here and there, and yet the overall sense of the film is chilling. It does echo ""Wall Street"" (the movie) in how it paints the business elite as mostly very well compensated for work that is dubiously constructive. I think this movie, which will never be as archetypal as that other, is a better made movie. It's better cast, too. If it lacks the brilliance of Michael Douglas in a role made for him, it has a whole cast of excellent fits, from Kevin Spacey as a tiring trader having shades of doubts about the business to Simon Baker as an up and coming executive slightly outside of the technicals to Jeremy Irons as the boss's boss who doesn't really know the business except by instinct, which is fine. Stanley Tucci is not well used, though he makes the most of a symbolic role that falls flat by the end, and Demi Moore is out of place and a bit wrong.See this? Yes. I'd recommend it. Plan to be absorbed and feel the mood and aura. And wonder about how this ""disaster"" as portrayed ends up getting diffused and lost in just a few years so that we only know that those inside traders are probably greedy nasty folk with family dogs just like everyone else with money. Or something equally watery.",Margin Call

This movie, much like ""Company Men"" is a very important movie to watch, and will infuriate you while you watch.

This movie deals with a banking firm that held mortgages and it came out that their formula was wrong for capital holdings and ruined the firm. Rather then coming forward with their problems the CEO decides to sell off the useless stock. To me, while watching this movie I kept getting more and more angry to the point of laughing and scoffing at the TV.

37,Dr_Coulardeau,The Big Bad Wolf is in the Fruit,10,1 October 2012,"That film is a pamphlet against an unregulated financial market and the story of that catastrophe that occurred in 2008 started after the 1929 crisis when Keynesian policies of all types were instated for individuals to buy on credit and even for the states to do the same. These policies have produced the credit crisis in Europe that we know now; Then in the 70s and 80s, especially with Reagan, and then when the Soviet bloc was out of the picture and no international competition was to be taken into account, we decided to get rid of all regulations on financial markets. Happy were the Chinese who recuperated Hong Kong in 1999 and kept a strict control over their financial markets.This deregulation of financial markets produced the subprime crisis that we know in 2008. But we have to keep in mind that we are all responsible because we elected the politicians we elected and we let them do anything and they on their side let the financiers do anything they wanted. And we know what happened and what we are still suffering because of it.The film does not concentrate on the horrific trauma the crisis is for the simple traders of the financial firm that is considered here. It concentrates on how the crisis can be managed by this firm who is happy to know before everyone else. They find out when the assistant sale manager who was just let go and who had devised a program to assess the financial situation of the firm, gives the USB key with it on his way out to the young rocket engineer who runs it and is able to project the present situation into the future. Too late boys and girls: in less than a week the whole financial Titanic hits rock bottom two miles under the iceberg.Within two days the truth must have come out, first day and first night, and then the problem must be solved to avoid bankruptcy and judicial lawsuits, second day. The boss then has to take a decision and it is simple. In the second day of this two day emergency 93% of all the spoiled assets must be sold, even at a loss. Better lose 20% than everything. And it has to be done by the traders who must be convinced to do it before the Stock Exchange closes in the afternoon.They are motivated with the announcement that they will all lose their jobs but that everyone who will reach the selling quota of 93% will get a more than one million premium, and if the department manages the same global quota, each trader will get an extra more than one million premium, nearly three millions all together. And they will do it, they will cut the branch on which they are sitting because of this nice little parachute or cushion given to them to soften the fall. Speak of faithfulness and loyalty.During that time the boss is playing his associates, deputies and other executives one against the others to select the two or three he will need afterwards. Because they liquidate their own firm, they lose all credibility and all customers, but since the crisis will explode just after that black day, which is a Friday of course, they will be accused of having started it, but in the longer run they will become geniuses and will recuperate their credibility and credit to start a new adventure, a financial speculative adventure of course, no matter what the conditions will be then.But you cannot flush the financial markets out of the picture. You have to get them under control and keep them under control. If we just blazed these financial firms out of the way we would be forgetting that we ALL need what they are providing: credit. We have an instalment purchasing plan here for a car, a house, a washing machine. We have a credit card there that gives us free or nearly free credit for slightly more than a month, though we cannot afford to overdraw at the end of the month when the credit card payments are balanced from your account, except if we can pay a 16 or 18% interest.And I repeat we are all responsible because we elected those who let the speculators come into the picture at first through the chimney like Santa Claus then through the window, finally through the door, at first under the table, then around the table and finally in the middle of the table top. It is high time proper authorities put all these financial people under control and get us rid of the immoral ones, those who are so un-ethical that you cannot reform them any more. That is difficult, that will be difficult, that will hurt. Let's hope all will foot the bill proportionally to their resources and means.And dram on the ending that is so similar to the end of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, the salesman planting carrot seeds at night in his garden that does not get any sunshine anyway.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Margin Call
38,howard.schumann,Wake up folks! The game is nearly over,9,11 December 2011,"Coinciding with the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations around the world protesting the gap between the concentration of wealth in one percent of the population and the rest of the nine-nine percent, first-time director J.C. Chandor's highly entertaining Margin Call looks at the motives and morality of those in positions of power in a fictional 107-year-old financial institution and how they react in a career-threatening crisis. Though, on the surface, the film seems to be an attack on those who, in the phrase of author Charles Eisenstein, ""occupy a world of pure symbol, manipulating numbers, and computer bitsdisconnected from the world of human suffering,"" ultimately its message seems to be directed not only at the ninety-nine percent, but also at the one percent, urging them to begin connecting with their humanity and conscience.Margin Call takes place over a 24-hour period in the boardrooms of a company that must do anything to survive, no matter how many bodies are strewn along the path. While the film takes on the ""crony capitalism"" denounced by President Obama in 2009, Chandor, who relied heavily on his father's experiences working for Merrill Lynch for 40 years, insists that the purpose of his film is not to ""teach people the evils of capitalism,"" but only to tell a human story. Intentionally or not, the film does both.Set in 2008 at the beginning of the worldwide financial crisis, Margin Call is supported by a superb ensemble cast including Kevin Spacey in one of his best performances in years as a soul-searching executive who has been with the same company for 34 years, Stanley Tucci as a recently deep-sixed manager whose files portend trouble for the company, Demi Moore as the only woman executive on the team, and Jeremy Irons as the ultimate profit-driven CEO who is more interested in the company's ability to pay another round of exorbitant bonuses than in who is marginalized in the process.As the film opens, we are made aware that people are going to be fired, lots of them. The first to go is risk analyst Eric Dale (Tucci) who it seems has discovered phony investments that threaten the company's financial solvency. Before Dale is unceremoniously escorted out of the building, he tells his employee, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), to ""be careful."" Sullivan, after verifying that Dale's figures are correct, tells his co-worker Seth (Penn Badgley) about the files and both contact the cynical upper-echelon trader Will Emerson (Paul Bettany). Company managers, headed by CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), who is reported to be making a yearly salary of $86 million dollars, are forced into an all-night meeting to devise a strategy to rescue the company.Others called into the late-night meetings to search for a method of damage control are Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), another top-executive, as well as analysts Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), and Ramesh Shaw (Aasif Mandvi). Led by Sam Rogers (Spacey), the plan is to sell worthless assets at the highest possible price to unsuspecting buyers, realizing that it may come back to haunt them. To ease their consciences, they offer substantial financial packages to those being let go and large bonuses to those whose job it is to sell the worthless bonds. The executives are not portrayed as devils, but as people who simply rationalize their questionable actions by claiming that there have always been financial crises.The fact is that the film, in addition to showing the ethical culpability of some at the highest level of the country's financial operations, creates sympathy for those who are riding a merry-go-round on which they are unable to get off. Rogers questions if what he is doing is right and others have doubts as well as to how nurturing their way of life actually is, Contrasting his empty existence in the world of Wall Street with a previous job, Eric Dale remarks that, as an engineer, he once built a bridge over the Ohio River that saved thousands of people great amounts of time and money.When Tuld tells Rogers that his work is better than digging ditches, Sam tells him that, at least in the case of digging ditches, there are holes in the ground to show for the effort. If Margin Call and the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators have one thing in common, it is the wish for a good life not only for those who are left behind, but also for those imprisoned in glass-enclosed skyscrapers, unable to experience the beauty of what can be created. Both are also in sync with the message: Wake up folks! The game is nearly over.",Margin Call

40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Sincere look at a white-collar crisis, but not all that accessible",7,8 February 2012,"Few of us can truly grasp the economic fundamentals of the 2008 stock market crash—how it happened, why it happened. Most of what we understand are the after effects, the human consequences. Rookie filmmaker J.C. Chandor's ""Margin Call"" attempts to merge those two understandings: the economics and the executive-level decision-making with the real-life impact and gravity of the situation on those with the power to make big choices. ""Margin Call"" is not as sophisticated as you might think. For one, on at least three occasions a character requests that someone explain something to them in laymen's terms. Normally, such convenient and patronizing dialog would be disastrous, but as the film progresses and we continue to observe how the decisions of few affect the lives of many, the choice begins to make sense: you don't need to be a math and science wiz to call the shots.The film opens with layoffs at an investment firm in 2008. Stanley Tucci's character is among the victims of a rather succinct and soulless dismissal, but on his way out of the building, he hands a young analyst named Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) a disc drive with the verbal addendum ""be careful."" Sullivan tinkers with the information late that night when he discovers a pattern suggesting disastrous losses for the firm in the coming days. Chandor's script follows the journey of this piece of information as it climbs the ranks of the company and more and more decision-makers enter the process of determining what to do with it. It goes from Sullivan and his co-worker (Penn Badgley) to a trader on Sullivan's floor (Paul Bettany), then to the trading head on the floor (Kevin Spacey) and then to a pair of senior-level executives (Simon Baker and Demi Moore) before reaching the CEO (Jeremy Irons). Each assesses and reassesses the situation before making a decision with ripple effects down the chain of command and then passing it to the next highest official.The message is clear: the few in power outweigh the many. The bigger the problem gets, the harsher the decisions. Spacey's character appears to be the stubborn bad guy toward the beginning, but he transforms into someone we pity by the end because of the way the higher-ups handle the situation. These changes in our character perception come swiftly and without making much of a peep, and in the control of some stellar actors, it's more than a new filmmaker could ask for.The trouble with ""Margin Call"" comes from an inability to connect with a wide, everyman audience. By and large, the problems and dire situations of the film are white-collar dilemmas: rich people trying to figure out how to stay rich. Without some other kind of connection to the material, which could be as simple as an interest in markets and investments, it becomes hard to care about the characters or the problems they're dealing with. In spite of all the dialogue for dummies, much of what exactly is happening remains esoteric.The human connection comes too little too late for ""Margin Call,"" though not in every sense. We do not see the impact of the film's events on the everyman until late in the game, when the realization hits that the traders of the firm must respond to orders from the top that will have a very trivial impact on their careers, and at the same time even more folks are at risk of losing their jobs. However, the conflict on screen is person-to-person, and the characters wrestle with all kinds of issues regarding their livelihood, the greater good and the welfare of the company. The film doesn't lack for humanity, it just lacks for gravity.Quinto, Bettany, Spacey, Tucci, Baker, Moore and Irons assure a certain standard for ""Margin Call."" They help put strong faces on talking heads arguing about issues far beyond the common person's understanding. It's not indecipherable gibberish or anything, but we can't learn and understand the logic at the rate at which it's explained, which means we can't process the emotions that come with it. Regardless, the actors crucially help us to realize the impact of the circumstances and consequently the language we struggle to understand.""Margin Call"" offers a rare experience, a peek into the cold truth of the financial world that forgoes the imposition of your usual characterizations for businesspeople: cutthroat execs, poor obedient peons, etc. The short time frame of the film's events helps give it a documentary feel minus a hand-held camera or any found footage labels. The portrait is genuine, but debatably accessible.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com",Margin Call
41,robert-temple-1,Collapse within hours,10,14 June 2012,"This is a highly exciting and subtle portrayal of the inside story of the sudden collapse of a huge New York investment bank, at the beginning of the financial meltdown. Presumably it is 'inspired by' Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. The dominating performance is by Kevin Spacey, who is at his best for years, as one of the top executives in the shuddering giant as it slides beneath the waves within a matter of hours. Chilling, creepy, and oleaginous is Jerremy Irons as the slithery and congenitally dishonest Chairman. Demi Moore has a surprisingly low-key role as the only woman in the tale, but she looks suitably anxiety-ridden, and her husky voice works well in the boardroom. Some of the less sophisticated viewers of this intelligent film may not understand all of it, much less catch all its subtle nuances. For this is no tabloid portrayal, but is an incisive and ultimately terrifying insight into what such situations may really be like, making few compromises with the clueless section of the public. The writer and director, J. C. Chandor, whose first feature film this is, deserves high praise for a gripping no-holds-barred cinema experience. He should have a splendid career ahead of him, if he is not bumped off by some of the people he must have irritated on Wall Street. The film is full of psychological depth and expertly constructed and mounting tension. More like this please!",Margin Call
42,Turfseer,Impressive Irons performance saves generic take on 2008 financial meltdown,6,3 December 2011,"'Margin Call' is first time writer/director J.C. Chandor's distillation of the 2008 financial meltdown. Chandor creates a compilation firm based on Lehman Brothers and other Wall Street firms that tanked during the Wall Street economic crisis. The action is compressed down to one evening and a following morning despite the fact that the actual meltdown took place over a few months. The characters are entirely fictional and I heard that Chandor, during a talk at the new Lincoln Center film center, created the characters without consulting anyone specifically on Wall Street but then had some friends who were in the financial industry, look the script over once it had been completed.The plot is rather simple. Things come to head at Chandor's fictional firm when seasoned risk management executive Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) is fired after another company downsizing. As he's being escorted from the building, he hands his subordinate, former physics ace, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a flash drive containing a snapshot of the seemingly deteriorating financial situation at the firm (one wonders why 'security' allowed him to hand the flash drive over to Sullivan). A series of executives then are informed of the crisis, culminating in the arrival of the big boss, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) who decides to sell off most of the company's assets resulting in big profits for the few executives and employees left at the firm but curtains for the rest of the underlings as well as a nasty kick in the pants to the overall US economy.Frankly, Chandor's attempt to dramatize the economic crisis is admirable but the subject matter doesn't really lend itself to palpable drama. Part of the problem is that many people (including myself) don't really understand how the financial system works. Chandor goes to great lengths to provide a simplified explanation for the financial collapse, but to be honest I still don't understand what it's all about, despite all of Chandor's attempts at transparency.Without a tension-filled plot, Chandor must fall back on strong characterizations of the principal players. Jeremy Irons really saves the day as CEO Tuld. Irons is the only actor amongst the solid cast, to turn his amoral financial executive into a flesh and blood human being. He also happens to have the best lines of dialogue in the script. Irons serves up a superb speech at the film's climax, detailing his cynical philosophy that financial downturns always occur in history and are unavoidable.The rest of the cast do their best in roles that are sorely underdeveloped. Quinto neatly conveys the integrity of a former ""rocket scientist"" who admits taking a job on Wall Street, simply ""for the money"". But Kevin Spacey struggles in his role as Sam, the ethical company man who refuses to quit because he also ""needs the money"". Chandor awkwardly attempts to humanize Spacey's Sam in the final scene, where the executive attempts to bury his recently deceased dog, under his ex-wife's lawn. The problem is that we don't find out enough about Sam to care about him. The same goes Paul Bettany as Will, whose main claim to fame is that he hangs out at strip clubs. Simon Baker does his best as the cold as steel executive Jared but he too lacks a back story. Ditto for Demi Moore's Sarah Robertson, who's thrown under the bus by CEO Fuld right before the big sell-off. Stanley Tucci ends up with the sorry sad sack role as the canned supervisor, who also throws principles to the wind by returning to the company one last time, after being threatened with retaliation by the sinking firm.Mr. Chandor must be commended for not only bringing the story of the the great 2008 financial collapse to the small screen but ensuring there were no happy endings. As in real life, the traders and executives broke no rules in this unregulated industry and hence were only guilty of ethical lapses, which of course were not punishable in a criminal court of law.There are those who may be satisfied with Chandor's sketchy and generic take on the financial collapse that precipitated the current financial downturn, but there are many more books and documentaries that will provide a more thoughtful and detailed reckoning of what really went on Wall Street during those heady times. If however, you wish to start with the basics, 'Margin Call' should be your baby.",Margin Call

44,meeza,The Chandorleer provides a lot of light to these stars!,8,18 February 2012,"I am no financial analyst or investment banker, but after experiencing the movie ""Margin Call"", I must suggest you to buy high on this compelling flick providing us a microcosm of how banks caused the financial crisis of 2008. First time Writer-Director J.C. Chandor should not worry about being downsized in the motion picture industry with this impressive debut. ""Margin Call"" is mostly set in an investment New York bank over a 24-hour period. During a downsizing chopping spree at the bank, a junior employee called Peter Sullivan is given a flash drive by his supervisor Eric Dale who ironically enough was one of those unlucky victims of the downsizing shopping spree; in other words, they told poor Eric Dale ""ya dale, y vete de aqui"". Anyways, the USB drive includes a project that Dale was working on that holds vital information. Peter subsequently completes the project and discovers that trading will soon exceed the historical volatility levels used by the firm to calculate risk. Because of overleverage, if the firm's assets (in mortgage backed securities) decrease by 25%, the firm will owe more than its market capitalization. In other words, you can take it to the bank that it is a ""red alert"" situation. Sullivan informs his higher ups, which they inform their higher ups, and before you could say ""damn I lost a lot of money in 2008 with my investments"" big decisions have to be made by the bank bigwigs that more than marginally could cause financial catastrophes to many investors but at the same time make fortunes from misfortunes to banking institutions. Sound familiar? I won't withdrawal too much more information on the movie's plot in my review to you, because that would be a spoiler crisis. However, I will be candid to state that Chandor is a filmmaker on the rise and I can see why he got enough numbers to be nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination. His direction was intense and his script was phenomenal. There is no risk calling the acting ensemble of ""Margin Call"" as one of the best of the year. Kevin Spacey was vintage Spacey as the conflicted head-of-trading Sam. Jeremy Irons was spectacular as the egoistic CEO John Tuld. Zachary Quinto provided some moral character relief to the picture with his fine performance as young Sullivan. You bet that I approved of Paul Bettany's work as senior trader Will Emerson. You want more! You got it, cause Demi Moore was very solid as the head of risk management Sarah Robertson. Simon says (actually I say) that Simon Baker cooked up a smooth performance as senior executive Jared Cohen. And then there is Tucci! Stanley Tucci hammers away another impressive acting effort as the former risk management employee Eric Dale. So now it's time for you to make the call on whether you want to time-invest on ""Margin Call"". I say set your margins and give it a whirl! ****Good",Margin Call
45,estebangonzalez10,Fictional story that rings truer than based on true story movies,8,9 December 2011,"¨There are three ways to make a living in this business: be first, be smarter, or cheat¨ Margin Call may be a fictional movie, but it has more truths in it than an actual Hollywood film that claims to be based on a true story. Despite not knowing a whole lot of economics I assure you we are all familiar with what happened in 2008 with the bubble burst in Wall Street because it has affected everyone's life. First time director and screen writer J.C. Chandor does a great job at recreating what probably happened inside one of the investment banks the night before the financial crisis actually took place. I don't know much about economics, but this movie is pretty easy to follow thanks to the smart script which in a way serves as an Economic for Dummies book. By making the actors explain the situation to their bosses in ¨plain English, ¨ Chandor is actually telling us what is going on in understandable terms. I wouldn't argue that their bosses would actually understand everything in harsher terms, but the audience needed to be informed so I'm not going to take credit away from Chandor for this because it needed to be done. If not most of us wouldn't have a clue of what was going on. Margin Call isn't just a film about the financial crisis, it also deals with some aspects about important business corporations and how sometimes as employers we are forced to do things that go against our moral beliefs. Most corporations run as ¨a dog eat dog world¨ and ¨survival of the fittest¨, and in this film we see plenty of that.A Bank investment firm is reducing its personnel in the risk management division letting go of almost 70% of its employees including their main analyst, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci). Dale seems to be working on something very important, and before leaving he gives his pen drive to a co-worker, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), so he can finish the work and warns him to be very careful. Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) is the division manager and he gives the remaining employees an inspirational speech about them being the best in their line of work and thus surviving in the company. The group decides to go out and celebrate with their boss Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), but Sam stays to see if he can review what Dale was working on. He manages to solve the equation that Dale never quite finished and the result was dreadful. The company is heading towards bankruptcy and the financial meltdown is about to begin. Sam calls his co-worker, Seth (Penn Badgley), and tells him that he should come back to the office with Will as soon as possible. It's midnight, but the situation can't wait any longer. When they arrive and discover what is happening they realize they have to call their bosses so up we go through the corporate ladder, first they call Sam, then Sam calls his boss Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), and she calls Jared (Simon Baker), until the Owner finally arrives in his personal helicopter, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons). They discuss everything that is going on in a meeting and realize that the financial crisis is about to hit hard and have to sell all their stocks as early as possible.One of the things I enjoyed the most about this movie is that it focuses on the financial meltdown in one confined space. We get to see how the main characters interact with each other inside the company and how everyone has to face a moral dilemma. It's not just a movie focusing on the financial meltdown, but it's more of a corporate drama where we have interesting characters who we end up caring about and understanding the moral dilemma they have to go through. There are some real good performances from some of the actors, and the cast is also very interesting. Stanley Tucci is always great in these small roles, Zachary Quinto delivers a strong performance as one of the lead characters, and Paul Bettany along with Kevin Spacey also give powerful performances as the struggle with some moral issues. Everything they have been working for all their lives is about to go down the drain, and the hardest decision is still right in front of them. The script is really engaging and well written. I loved this movie. Inside Job was a great documentary about the financial collapse, but Margin Call gives us a better look inside as to what might have gone on inside these big corporations.

The top notch cast makes this very watchable however with a slow burning story, that takes place over a 24hr period at ""The Firm"" where some kinda bad financial sh*t is going down.People are losing their jobs and an investment analyst (Zachary Quinto) has just discovered ""something""(?) that could put the whole company in jeopardy. This results in all the big bosses showing up and a quick liquidation sale before it all becomes worthless (in Layman's terms).This reminded me of (Moneyball), because I didn't fully understand what that movie was about either but I still liked it.I just wish I could figure out the significance of the last scene with Sam (Kevin Spacey) burying his dog on his ex-wife's lawn, it seemed important. 10.13",Margin Call
48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Calm before the storm,9,21 May 2016,"J.C. Chandor's Margin Call sustains a laser focused, wilfully meticulous look at the days leading up to the 2008 financial crash, showing us life within one wall street office building during a nervy period which now no doubt is remembered as the calm before the storm. Various characters in different positions of the hierarchy anxiously brace themselves as the jobs begin to get cut and the dread looms towards them like the inevitable rising sun at dawn. It's set all in one afternoon and night, compacting a far reaching event which spanned years into the microcosm of a single 24 hour window, a tactic which sits through the larger world implications and brings it in for something a little more intimate. Zachary Quinto plays a young trader who discovers a rip in the lining of the economic infrastructure, a precursor to the eventual disaster. I'm not being purposefully vague and cryptic with that, I just don't personally understand all the exact ins and outs of what went wrong back then, and having not the slightest knowledge of wall street jargon, that's the best I can do. He brings this knowledge to his superiors who react in varying ways. Kevin Spacey is a disillusioned big shot who sees his life going off the rails alongside the country's market, and mopes in his swanky office. Paul Bettany is a cocky young upstart who uses casual indifference to shade the bruises he's got from knowing what will happen. Demi Moore is a company head who looks out for herself while others in the company. Jeremy Irons provides scant moments of humour as a bigwig fixer who arrives on a chopper to set things straight, or at least assess the damage. The best work of the film comes from Stanley Tucci (surprise, surprise) as a jilted employee who has been laid off in the confusion, and is seething about it. His melancholic monologue about what it takes to propel America's industry and economy forward resonates with a humanity that cuts deep. The film ticks along with a pace that's both measured and swift, with little time for introspect, yet showing it to us anyway amid the chaos. Watch for appearances from Penn Badgley, Al Sapienza, Simon Baker and Mary McDonnell as well. Chandor let's the proceedings thrum with an inevitability that hangs in the air as the promise of the impending crisis, a feeling that serves to impart not why it happened, not how it happened, but the fact that it did happen, to each and every individual person who was affected, as opposed to the country as a whole.",Margin Call
49,EUyeshima,First-Time Filmmaker Deftly Handles the Financial Meltdown on Human-Size Terms,8,23 October 2011,"Having been the victim of corporate downsizing more than once, I was immediately engaged with this propulsive 2011 corporate drama from the beginning as Stanley Tucci's character, a seasoned risk management executive named Eric Dale, is told in a coldly indifferent manner that he is being laid off after 19 years with the same unnamed Wall Street firm. It's a piercing yet dramatically economical scene that perfectly summarizes how bloodless the corporate world can be, and in first-time writer/director J.C. Chandor's effort set on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis , it is very cold indeed with 80% of the trading floor being let go. As Dale is escorted out of the building, he hands a flash drive to his prodigious assistant Peter Sullivan and tells him to take a look at it and ""Be careful.""Once Sullivan analyzes the data, he realizes the universal gravity of Dale's warning - that the firm is so over-committed to underwater mortgage-backed securities that the total potential loss exceeds the firm's total market capitalization value. In other words, the projected scenario means the firm will soon owe a lot more than it's worth, and the market will be on the verge of an apocalyptic meltdown. What happens after this discovery is a series of sharply intense clandestine confrontations with each level of higher-ups recognizing the ramifications of the inevitable disaster, each one far more nuanced in character than we are used to seeing in films from Oliver Stone about greed and immorality. Blessedly, Chandor doesn't stoop to the customary stereotypes in this corporate cage match, but what he does manage is capture the moral compass underneath each player by way of a cast that really delivers the goods with powerfully implosive performances.Zachary Quinto (""Star Trek"") is initially at the center of the plot as Sullivan and performs well enough in the constraining, semi-heroic role, but the veterans really stand out here beginning with Kevin Spacey, who effectively plays against type as Sam Rogers, a genuine company man, the seen-it-all head of the trading team who rallies what's left of the trading floor with corporate brio but then faces his own cross to bear struggling to commandeer a fire sale of worthless assets dumped on unsuspecting clients. The other standout is Jeremy Irons, who masterfully resuscitates the cool cunning of his Claus von Bulow from ""Reversal of Fortune"" as the acerbically survivalist CEO John Tuld. He handily controls the boardroom scene with cutting humor and hostile precision. One of the film's more pleasant surprises is Demi Moore in cool, brisk form as Sarah Robertson, the top risk officer and lone female executive who knows her career is at stake with the discovery of this folly. Tucci is excellent in his smallish role as Dale and gets to show off his resigned character's engineering aptitude with a brief monologue about building a bridge.Comparatively less impressive but playing their more predictable roles fitfully are Penn Badgley as Sullivan's younger, overtly money-obsessed colleague Seth Bregman; Paul Bettany as Dale's nihilistic, snake-oil salesman of a boss, Will Emerson; and Simon Baker as the most morally despicable executive of the bunch, Jared Cohen. Mary McDonnell has a brief and frankly unnecessary scene as Rogers' ex-wife, and I didn't even recognize the usually hilarious Broadway personality Susan Blackwell as the hatchet woman in the opening scene. There are a few flaws with Chandor's observant screenplay, for example, the overly analogous scenes of Rogers dealing with his dying dog and a rooftop scene that plays up Emerson's nihilistic nature too predictably. In addition, some scenes play either too murkily or too clinically to achieve the precise dramatic effect they should. I think the absence of a musical score also contributes to the sterility of the proceedings. However, as a first-time filmmaker, Chandor more than impresses with his deft handling of such a zeitgeist moment with the Occupy Wall Street protests gaining understandable momentum right now.",Margin Call

Margin Call revolves around a day in a company that finds out that it is about to crash. It shows the way these ruthless companies treat their staff and how the people at the very top seem to get away with murder while they play with imaginary Dollars and millions of descent peoples lives. I can't even begin to explain what really happened with the financial crash and i'm not sure many bankers can but it doesn't really matter when watching Margin Call. All you need to know is that it happened and that there are massive reverberations that come from it.This film has a great cast - Kevin Spacey , Paul Bettany and Jeremy Irons are just a few and they do a great job.

What's even nicer is that the movie keeps the cool even after the no-turning-back move has been decided and being taken, with only one character expressing his feeling, in a secretive way. The acting overall is indeed a great one. Zachary Quinto did well in portraying the newbie with concerns.

This is the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008 for the United States.Here's what you will NOT find in here: Government involvement, Newspaper headlines, no talking head analysts, no TV breaking stories, bailouts, no mention of the words Toxic Assets, and surprisingly no mention of the term Margin or selling on Margin, or Margin Call. Why? Because we are shown what was possibly the very beginning of the collapse of financial institutes within the United States in 2008. The items above will be heard and are still being heard. The word Mortgages was heard about 2-times, and if I understand things correctly, the mortgages the company held were now far below the value of what they were worth. Now, what to do? What to do? So we are privy to the top executives of the company trying to figure out how to escape their losses. That is really all you need to know to enjoy this movie.I believe the financial collapse was shown in a very simple way for all of us to understand (speak for yourself, Bob). The people at the very top didn't want to know the details and positioned themselves in such a way they were pay grades above all that; and they wanted the worker analysts to spell it out for them in English. Simple words, see? Well, it helped us, I think.The acting was pretty good, although none of them made me care for them. Well, a little bit for Eric (Tucci) because of what happens to him in the beginning of this, but that was just a mild caring on my part. This movie had the feel of a movie I saw some time ago: Glengarry Glen Ross (great movie btw). It felt like the people who wrote that wrote this. Maybe it's just me with my déjà vu kicking in again (indeed).What I didn't care for was the use of the F-word with just about every conversation. It was overkill.

56,moviexclusive,Tense and well-plotted thriller set against a spot-on Wall Street milieu that boasts top-notch performances from an ensemble cast,8,29 December 2011,"How many of us not working in the financial industry actually knew what precipitated the economic meltdown in 2008-09 that the world economy is still struggling to recover from today? The most we probably know is that some bad financial products that had something to do with subprime mortgages led to what President Obama proclaimed 'the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s'. We also know this- at the heart of it all was greed, greed of the common man on the street and of course greed of the people on Wall Street.The boardroom thriller 'Margin Call' imagines what could have happened in a Wall Street investment firm on the eve of the economic collapse, and though at no point is the firm named, the references to the now- defunct Lehman Brothers are all too obvious. After all, the company's CEO is the magisterial John Tuld (played with chilling ease by Jeremy Irons), whose name rhymes with former Lehman head Richard Fuld. Tuld swoops in at 4 a.m. into the company's towering New York building, in a sign of the severity of the crisis that the firm suddenly finds itself knee-deep in.Unfolding over the course of a 36-hour period, the tense and tightly wound thriller begins as about 80% of the workforce on the risk management team is laid off when monthly profits from their mortgage- backed securities fall below the mark. One of those shown the door is senior analyst Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a longtime employee who's recently been working on a project that he says is of utmost importance. But the human resource employee sent to convey the bad news would have none of it, so Eric passes his work on a USB thumb drive to one of his young protégés, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), just before he leaves.""Be careful,"" Eric adds, his ominous words leaving Peter intrigued. After staying late to crunch some numbers, Peter stumbles onto some distressing reality- the company is loaded with toxic assets and based on historical volatility is likely to go under very quickly. Peter calls his colleague Seth (Penn Badgley) to summon his boss Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), the panic slowly spreading up the chain of command- first to Will's acerbic superior Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), then to Sam's smarmy boss Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), and finally to the company CEO Tuld.All the while, first-time writer/director J.C. Chandor keeps a taut watch on the unfurling proceedings, letting the gravity of Peter's discovery emanate slowly up the echelons and in the process holding his audience riveted. They get even more compelling in the second half, as Tuld gives the executive order to save the very institution by selling off the firm's entire portfolio of toxic securities to unwitting customers in the course of the very next day. ""Be first. Be smart. Or cheat,"" is Tuld's motto- but as Sam ponders, at what expense?It's no secret what becomes of Tuld's decision to cheat- the consequence of which we are still grappling with- and what is even more shocking is how Sam not only eventually rationalises it for the good of the company, but manages to persuade all of the white-collar traders on his floor (or whoever is left) to do likewise. The question it prompts you to think is this- how many of the Lehman employees were equally complicit in their CEO's decision to cheat the markets, even after they knew the health of the products they were selling?It all feels so real, and therein lies Chandor's greatest achievement- his debut feature after more than a decade of commercials is well- steeped in Wall Street milieu, in no small measure thanks to the exposure to that world from growing up with a father who was a Merrill Lynch trader. Chandor has also assembled a top-notch cast- among them, Spacey delivers his best work in years playing the weary middle-aged top executive whose conscience has grown increasingly diminished over the years. Just as noteworthy is Irons, who shines in the role as the villain with charismatic ruthlessness. The supporting cast are equally excellent- including Demi Moore's chief risk officer who is arrowed to take the blame for the firm's downfall by none other than Tuld himself.Rare is the film that gives such a lucid insight into the workings of Wall Street, and the culture of corporate greed and self-interest that ultimately devastated the lives of millions around the world. It's also a first-class thriller, full of brooding tension and compelling ethical and moral predicaments that are ever prescient today as they were three years ago. Even if you know what went down at Wall Street back in 2008, this film and its ensemble of well-crafted characters will open your eyes to the men (and women) inside the shadowy offices of Manhattan's spires who once held the world's fate in their hands- and let it slip.-www.moviexclusive.com",Margin Call
57,bandw,The day the house of cards started to collapse,9,8 January 2012,"Movies that draw the curtain back for a look into what goes on behind the scenes in a national news story have a great appeal if they are done well, as this movie is. I think that having a little background about the financial crisis that reached its peak in late 2008 would be helpful before watching this, but not necessary--this could play as strictly fictional and still hold your attention. But, with any knowledge you cannot help but see this as based on the collapse of Lehman Brothers. For example, Richard Fuld was the CEO of Lehman when it collapsed and the CEO of the unnamed investment firm in this movie is John Tuld. For a more fact-based account see the movie ""Inside Job."" In particular the interview with Lehman's lawyer in the extras on the ""Inside Job"" DVD could easily serve as the inspiration for ""Margin Call.""The ensemble cast is uniformly good. Jeremy Irons is outstanding as John Tuld, he projects the gravitas (and arrogance) of a person who is a CEO of a large financial institution. The way that the analysis of impending disaster makes its way from a low level risk analyst up the management chain is handled in a way to make this a thriller. When the news finally makes it to Tuld, he helicopters at night onto the landing pad on top of the company skyscraper as if God himself had arrived.The score consists mostly of what I suppose is the obligatory music to establish an ominous background emotion. But, exemplifying the case that a more creative score could be used, there is a sequence scored with a Chopin prelude where the camera pans over the nearly empty work area late at night, with computer screens lighting the room, that is very effective.A lot of people get their comeuppance here, but the sad thing is that the carnage is executed from the bottom up. The big fish get away. In one of the final scenes Jeremy Irons gives a chillingly cynical analysis that attempts to justify his company's actions. The higher-ups talk about what a useful service they have performed and that they should be proud of what they have done. This may seem like over the top satire, but I have actually seen such people make these statements on being interviewed.There is some attempt to humanize the tragedy with a couple of the characters, but this movie did not have me coming away with a warm and fuzzy feeling about financial institutions.",Margin Call

It wants to provide an insight into an event without giving any insight into it whatsoever having frustratingly vague lines of exposition. I didn't expect a thriller, but it doesn't have much drama in it either. However, the acting is great, it's a delight to see all these faces together, even though a few key lines are few too hokey for this hand-held atmosphere.

62,napierslogs,The buying and selling of protagonists and antagonists in a profanely straight film,7,20 December 2011,"Set during the recent financial crisis, ""Margin Call"" does something that most of these sobering dramas do not. It's not about the characters reactions but their expected actions and takes place primarily in board rooms. A large number of rich and even richer guys work for a financial company that buys and sells. Buys and sells what is blurry, likely on purpose.The only place where the movie really falters is when the top executives (the even richer guys) ask the junior analysts (the rich guys) to speak in basic English. That is supposed to be for the benefit of the audience, but all that I got out of it was that the problem is their stocks are now value-less and the stock market is going to crash. Because the option of not making money isn't an option.It starts with the firing of many personnel. The one of significance is Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) who was working on something that he thinks might be a problem. The firm doesn't care but the junior guys, namely Peter (Zachary Quinto), solves the problem and it is indeed a problem since life and the financial world will basically end.The place where ""Margin Call"" makes the best move is when Peter goes straight to his boss with the problem. Wouldn't it be more dramatic if he kept it to himself and tried to cover up tracks and create a bigger problem? Every other movie seems to think so. But this one continues with the right chain and Peter's boss goes to his boss who goes to his boss who goes to the boss, and before we know it we're watching a movie that takes place in one single day, in one room, with no deliberate cover-ups and the only people who are going to lose big are the nameless, faceless individuals out in the real world, not our protagonists or antagonists.""Margin Call"" scored well with Independent Spirit Award nominations; deservedly so for Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay. The dialogue has liberal use of a certain ""F"" word, but when they are able to form full sentences with one word and make it both funny and character-enriching that's the type of feat that deserves an award. There are too many actors to start singling them all out but that last accomplishment goes to Simon Baker (one of the even richer guys).

A woman in a business suit is hunting for someone in the offices of one of New York's high-rise office buildings. She's obviously a stranger since the other workers don't seem to recognize her, and she doesn't know what the person she seeks looks like. Finally, she finds him and asks him to accompany her into a private conference room. In the conference room she lowers the boom: the firm is letting him go. She's part of a hired agency who visits firms to lay off and/or fire workers instead of the firm having to do the dirty work themselves. They act as a cushion between the firm and the poor schmuck who's getting the ax.During the meeting, he tells the representative that he's currently working on an important project, but the agent offers a generic reply that whatever he's working is no longer his concern, and the firm will take care of it. Of course, it's obvious she has no idea what she's talking about because she's from an outside firm simply engaged to lower the ax on unsuspecting office works. She really has nothing to do with the intricacies of the firm itself. After he's cleaned out his desk, he gives a flash-drive to one of his underlings who's still with the firm and says ""Just be careful."" Later Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), a traders manager, holds a meeting and breaks the news that 80% of the firm had been let go, but those who remain were the most successful, the survivors. At first everything is upbeat despite the lay-offs. This is the beginning of one of the best films of its type about the cut-throat world of financial firms on Wall Street, ""Margin Call"".The man they let go, Eric Dale, was some kind of senior risk-management adviser, and he was working on the profit-income-risk of the company and realizing something was terribly wrong. He had given the flash-drive to one of the lower level risk-management advisers, Peter Sullivan, who looks through the data on the flash-drive and fills in the missing pieces. The firm is in huge financial trouble. He calls his co-worker Seth at a nearby bar/strip club, who informs his boss, Will Emerson (Paul Bettany, the Albino of the Da Vinci Code)that they need to return to the firm and see the data, even though by now it's 11:00pm. (We learn later that Emerson spends just under $70,000 a year on booze and broads.) And they need Eric Dale to return to the offices, even though they not only just fired him but they disconnected his company cell phone. Sullivan shows Rogers and Emerson the data, which demonstrates the company is more heavily in debt than its entire worth. In other words, the company owes more than what the company could be sold for on the open market.Eventually, Chief Risk-Management Officer Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) and Simon Baker (Jared Cohen), one of the top executives, are brought together with Rogers, Emerson, Sullivan, and Seth into a meeting on one of the top floors of the executive suites to discuss the nature of the problem. By 3:00am in the morning, the CEO of the entire firm flies in by helicopter. What is the nature of the problem and what is the short-term solution? Apparently, these after-midnight meetings were occurring at many New York financial firms on the eve of the crisis.An outstanding completely character/drama-driven film. The cast is first rate. No real big ""stars"" but a cast of heavy hitters in acting. And a first-rate script, one of the best since David Mamet's ""Glen Garry Glen Ross"".

This realization has Executives circling back to the office in a depicted 24-hour period that will give viewers an inside look at corporate greed and the moral decisions that employees face when confronted with a conflict between ethical behavior and their own personal (financial) well-being.Directed by J.C. Chandor, Margin Call is a fascinating and intelligent film that is as relevant as it is honest in its situational and character driven scenarios. Actors Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Simon Baker and Jeremy Irons all play various levels of Executive Management that are forced to make tough decisions that will test their loyalty to the organization against their moral compasses and principals.Having worked a majority of my career in such an office environment, I can attest to the film's authenticity. Each of the characters are relatable real people. And the boardroom finger pointing and Executive rhetoric are spot on (we loved the scenes where any of the Executives asked junior employees to explain things to them like they were 'a child' as they seem incapable of understanding the business lingo to which they are responsible).As a companion piece to HBO's Too Big To Fail, Margin Call is a superbly crafted and incredibly complex detailing of money over morals and corporate survival techniques and strategies that make Tribal Counsel on television's Survivor look like a trip to Disneyland.Each of the ensemble cast hit every appropriate note and the resulting solutions as presented by said characters is as plausible as it is frighteningly unsettling.Margin Call may get more laid back audiences lost in the various financial speak which it purposefully does not dumb down. A particular conversation that the Stanley Tucci character has with Paul Bettany about the building of a bridge and the calculable hours they bridge saved the communities is as riveting as it is difficult to follow.In one particular scene when the proverbial poop is hitting the fan, the Kevin Spacey character utters, ""Remember this day boys. Remember this day."" At the conclusion of the film, I could not help but think that if I was involved I would not only remember the day, but my entire future would have been shaped by it.www.killerreviews.com",Margin Call
67,joebloggscity,Interesting story on a day in hell for a collapsing investment bank...,8,2 March 2012,"Got to say that this is a very interesting film. Don't approach it expecting the high jinx and testosterone as featured in other financial movies like Boiler Room and Wall Street. This film takes a relatively more sedate, thoughtful and believable approach.This film is a day in liquidation for an unnamed bank (though obviously based on Lehman Brothers). We watch as the staff realise their plight and discuss their options through the night before executing their last orders the next day. It's quite an education to watch the bankers in their predicament.The ensemble are excellent and give weight to their characters. Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto and Demi Moore are wonderful as the embattled and defeated employees. However, it is Jeremy Irons as the head of the company who steals the show. He puts in an exceptional performance which manages to combine humour, pomp, arrogance and hubris. He is simply majestic. Seems that the cast was almost perfectly chosen for their roles.With a setting on a trading floor with interludes outside, we get a voyeuristic look at the embellished lives of these people. Very interesting and we see what they are going to lose. For many watching there will be schadenfreude and not much pity.If there are any weaknesses then laymen will find it hard to understand all that is happening. They make certain efforts to explain succinctly what is going on but the point of the film is not really to give an in depth tutorial, more a snapshot of what was happening as all was crashing around the bankers.I enjoyed the film. There will be something for most here whether they have an interest in the financial markets or not. Take a punt on this one, it will likely pay out dividends for you.",Margin Call
68,itamarscomix,An acting-fest and morality tale,7,26 April 2012,"It seems that Margin Call is viewed by many people here as a historical document, which leads to dissatisfaction and many complaints. That's probably a mistake. I know very little about the machinations of Wall Street and investment banks or about the circumstances that lead to the recent economic crisis; from reviews I gather that Margin Call didn't paint a precise picture. It doesn't matter, because the film isn't about that, but about people. It's a fascinating insight into the minds of people who hold a disproportionate amount of power over the rest of us, and the kinds of decisions they make. Whether or not it describes exactly how things work, the why is more important.Margin Call can be placed on the same page as 12 Angry Men and Glengarry Glen Ross - though it's nowhere near as good as those two - in that it manages to put faces on people we rarely think about as people, and it manages to keep the viewer interested and invested in an aspect of our lives which, important as it is, doesn't really interest us much. The sharp script and top-notch acting (from the likes of Kevin Spacey, Staley Tucci, Zachary Quinto and Paul Bettany, though I was somewhat underwhelmed by Jeremy Irons) create engaging, relatable, complex characters who give us only glimpses into what makes them tick, and as dull as a film about banking sounds, that's enough to make it constantly engaging. Margin Call is a character study and a morality tale - a study of human nature and what drives out decisions, and even though very little of the actual plot remained with me after watching it, the humanity of the characters certainly did.",Margin Call

70,mikayakatnt,Dryer than overcooked chicken (and just as boring),4,10 March 2020,"This movie is The Big Short but without the humor or the information.I'll do my best to review this movie without spoiling.Understanding how the 2008 recession happened is important. But Margin Call does little in achieving this goal. The movie tries to act smart to the financially illiterate. It fails this goal in both information and entertainment.First off, we're expected to believe that a fired employee wants to save the company. That fired employee has company-confidential information on an UNSECURED USB STICK. He tries to save the company after he got screwed over. Anyone sensible would sell to the company's first competitor instead of saving it.Second, the dialogue is unbearable and even cringe-worthy at points. Someone being a literal ""rocket scientist"" ""just knows it."" Confusing vocab is tossed around without explanation. People brag many times how much they make to show us how rich they are. And let's not forget the ex-engineer who spends two minutes ""calculating"" numbers. No one speaks like that. Even Wall Street bankers.No financial vocabulary is understood or explained. Actors look at sheets of paper and ""know it."" We don't even show the graph that shows how screwed the company is. Like the actors, we're expected to ""just know it.""Costumes are not convincing to the trained eye. Not sure of the dressers ever seen a real Wall Street banker. Not a single contrast collar in this entire movie. The ""junior"" guy is the only guy who doesn't wear a tie in the whole cast. Any Wall Street firm would make him the first to wear one. And we're expected to believe that the fat cat CEO wears a button collar.And there's one moment that agonizes me. One scene has the actors holding up a magazine to prove they're worried about current events. The magazine held an Economist issue is from April 2008. The event's (I assume) in this film happen in September 2008. Does no one clean these guys' offices?The ending does not make sense to the layman. The audience doesn't understand what's going on or cannot emphasize with the protagonists. That's the only two conclusions I foresee for this movie.2/5.

71,barryrd,Conscience vs. Self-interest in a gripping story of financial manoeuvres,9,29 November 2015,"Margin Call is one very suspenseful movie that takes the viewer inside a Manhattan investment firm where the stock market brains and their bosses are forced to choose between saving their own hides or unleashing a financial Armageddon. The battle lies inside their own consciences. Most of them know they should have left years or months before the company reached this possible disaster but now they can't weasel out; it's a case of Us vs. Them, the many innocent bystanders who suffer the consequences. Kevin Spacey was excellent as the second tier boss who showed some conscience and his choice is critical. Jeremy Irons is a first-rate villain as the CEO, a man trained to make decisions and to ensure the financial interest of the firm. These two actors show the opposite sides of the battle lines. The two connect in a posh dining room overlooking Manhattan after the all-night strategy moves and meetings. Jeremy Irons offers his rendition of the scenario as he recounts successive stock market crashes over the past centuries, which he states are inevitable, and the choice is kill or be killed. In a gut-wrenching scene where the office is invaded by a trained team of dragon-slayers in suits, we see Stanley Tucci as the hedge fund analyst, who is fired and forced to leave on the spot. It is he who sees the ticking time bomb and alerts his colleagues; then he disappears on an all-night bender before they can contact him because the suits disabled his mobile phone. It is clear that this movie, made in 2011, was inspired by the stock market crash of 2008 and draws on the the divided views and hindsight over that turmoil. If you follow the stock market, you can recall the grim sensation of watching the lines of the graph slip into a free fall. Seven years after that panic, we are still feeling the effects. This movie recreates very vividly what might have happened behind the scenes. Great entertainment and a candid look at human behaviour!",Margin Call
72,JohnRayPeterson,"Fascinating, thrilling and insightful",8,27 December 2011,"You may not be familiar with the Gaussian Copula equation or Nobel prize winning John Nash's equilibrium, but that's the sort of thing the actors are staring at on the computer screens when all hell breaks loose. Yes, Wall Street was fixated on mathematical models they did not understand and only cared about as an excuse to do what the financial elite has always been doing, screwing the little guy. This movie offers insight on the goings on in a Wall Street firm that was first to realize the extent and ramification of the greed gone amok. What a cast! Kevin Spacey and Stanley Tucci, Paul Bettany and Jeremy Irons to name the top guns. Before the movie even started, I was excited to see all these icons in one production.The writer/director, J.C. Chandor, did a splendid job and so did the cinematographers; I'm glad the acting talent was not wasted as it could have (case in point, the film 'Main Street') with unproven directors. The movie is relatively fast paced because it depicts events in a 24 hours time period; that was a smart approach. The human side, character development, of some of the participants is very well balanced with the cold hard high-stakes game that is Wall Street.For those who will take the time to listen carefully at the dialogue and take in the boardroom wisdom being delivered by the likes of Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey, there is insight worth considering in our daily lives.

74,rubenm,Inside story about the way bankers do business,5,28 January 2012,"This film is an honest, sincere effort to show us what happened in the big Wall Street banks during the height of the financial crisis. Un unnamed bank has invested so much in risky assets, that if the value would diminish by 25 percent, the loss would be greater than the market value of the bank. The risk manager who discovers this gets fired, so there's no-one who knows what to do. It's a nice starting-point for a film, but in this case it merely leads to a lot of talk, and not a lot of suspense. Different bankers talking to each other in different situations - that's about it. Okay, there are nice one-liners, like the ceo talking about money: 'Pieces of paper with pictures on it so we don't have to kill each other just to get something to eat.'I'm not a script doctor, but I would have spiced the story up by elaborating about the risk manager who got fired and is nowhere to be found. That could have been a nice subplot, leading to some scenes outside the Manhattan office towers where the bank has its HQ. But the writers focus on the money story without any relief. This movie is a nice inside story about the way bankers do business, with some mild criticism about their greed and lack of responsibility. But it's not the definitive movie about the financial crisis.",Margin Call

Chandor offered us a pure immersion in the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, based on a script and a direction not so didactic, which is logical in a way if you don't want to weigh down the scenario.Unfortunately, with such a specialized subject, this choice sets in a real distance between the story and the uninformed, finance unaware viewer, who struggles to understand all the whys and wherefores of this (serious) situation. This is the real problem of the movie. You find yourself enduring the plot, moreover in an ultra technical jargon throughout the movie, which is quite discouraging and frustrating.Still, the dark atmosphere and the cynical aspect are very captivating, and the cast, although a bit uneven, managed to do the job.",Margin Call
76,dragokin,a gripping financial thriller,7,23 March 2013,"Trying to find the right genre for Margin Call i thought drama/thriller was too broad to describe it. ""Financial thriller"" was the closest i could get. No-one died, there were neither wild car chases nor shots being exchanged, yet there has been suspense building up.It is important to add that i didn't measure the factual accuracy of the movie, in the same manner i've never questioned the reality of thrillers and action movies. Margin Call is a work of fiction and, as it usually is the case, offers a simplified view of what happened. I didn't detect the aspiration to tell us what really went on behind the scenes right before the crash of 2008, thus i didn't judge the movie as i would a historical drama.Having said that, Margin Call offers a range of convincing characters working in a company operating on Wall Street. They accidentally stumbled upon a prediction of a market crash that has already begun. The alarm is sound and everyone up the corporate ladder is summoned to deal with it.This was the only time where the movie left me skeptical. After following news reports for a couple of decades now i'd say that wise old men such as Jeremy Irons' top manager are a minority bordering with statistical error. In the long run they all tend to worry about their bonus and severance pay rather than the survival of the company.Margin Call tried to give us hope that the top management ""never cheated"". The middle management, played but Simon Baker and Demi Moore, were the opportunists who haven't resisted the temptation to offer shady financial products. The people at the bottom (Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto) were earnest folks earning their living at the firm. This might correspond with the reality but it also showed authors', in particular writer's, affinity for fantasy.I'd say that everyone involved in business around the stock exchange and financial products are well aware that they participate in an abstract gamble that might lead to the collapse of global economy. It didn't help one of the characters mentioning that without stock brokers people would go to casinos...In any case, Margin Call is worth watching.",Margin Call
77,TheSquiss,Greed is only good if you're at the top.,6,16 June 2012,"What happens when an investment bank makes a large proportion of its staff redundant? What happens when one of the victims is Eric Dale, the head of Risk Management, and he's part way through analyzing the margins, past and projected? What happens is, Dale (played by the ever excellent Stanley Tucci) is escorted out of the building lest he inflict any damage on the firm out of revenge, his company phone is immediately switched off, he's blackmailed into accepting a six-month severance deal and is wiped from their thoughts, never to be contacted again. Oh, and in a parting gesture, he leans out of the lift, hands his subordinate a USB stick and says just two words: ""Good luck."" On the basis of Margin Call, if your former boss ever says that to you, you and the company are in all kinds of do-do.Margin Call deals with the twenty-four hours following those fateful words, when Dale's assistant (Star Trek and Lost's Zachary Quinto) completes the analysis and discovers the firms projected losses to be far, far greater than the entire firm's assets. And with an investment bank, we're probably dealing with telephone numbers.Baring in mind this is a film driven by dialogue and figures, it's actually compelling and a very worthy way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday night. I'll offer an addendum to that, though: If you have a business mind you'll get along very well with this. If not, there's a possibility you'll be bored senseless and, in the case of my wife, fall asleep on my (or somebody else's, hopefully) shoulder.The cast is enough to pique the interest, bringing together the likes of Tucci, Quinto, Demi Moore and Kevin Spacey, the latter in a role not a million miles from his character in Horrible Bosses. In the space of two scenes, Spacey's character pragmatically condemns much of his staff to unemployment and then seems genuinely upset that his dying dog is costing him more than $1,000 per day to keep alive. The irony of his situation escapes him completely and hints at the level of greed that has infected the bank at every level and taken it way beyond the point of no return.For me, the greatest excitement was wondering who would play Spacey's boss, the CEO of the investment bank. I'd deliberately not read any reviews or cast list for Margin Call and so, when we reached the scene of the CEO arriving in a helicopter, I ran through the possibilities of heavyweight actors who could justifiably play the boss of the great Kevin Spacey: Frank Langella? Anthony Hopkins? In case you haven't read the cast list either, I'll leave you to guess. I was surprised by the choice but not disappointed.The film draws up questions about ethics and legalities, about morals versus greed. We know it occurred and, at a time when the taxpayer has bailed out a few banks, watched others tumble and railed against persisting seven-figure bonuses, we're well aware it's continuing. It's just that we're impotent and can do nothing more than watch good films, such as this, depicting the folly of those who love money like a disease loves a healthy body.Another film review from The Squiss.

This film lacks the needed tension for a Friday film night for example, but this film is heavily relatable and the acting and characters are superb and carry this film.So why did i find this interesting? The characters. What this film is illustrating is the ""behind the scenes"" of a giant corporation and how they deal with a giant crisis. The characters that stood out for me were Penn Badgeley, Paul Bettany and Kevin Spacey. To start they were acted superbly well, but I really did relate to them, Penn in particular, and it had me absolutely hooked in.It's a weird review to write, because I'd normally talk about the plot seen as though that's the main thing you notice about a film when you watch it and it makes or breaks any movie. This is just a little different, because as mentioned prior this film lacks a certain tension needed. The film itself is really smartly written, but it needed a little more to it, to entice you in more.I personally enjoyed it, but I will guarantee people will hate it due to the lack of things going on.

80,dfle3,U.S. breaks it. Blames England for it. 95%,9,19 March 2012,"Excellent drama about the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) of a few years ago. However, at some point into this movie, I just realised that, once again, Hollywood was casting the English as the villains..apparently Americans are simply the best world citizens and butter wouldn't melt in their mouths.That observation aside, it's hard to fault this movie. At the start of the movie, it's not quite clear what is going on...a financial trading room is entered by some official looking people and certain staff of the trading room are being sought out. To what end is unclear, at least initially.The film goes into a little detail about why the GFC occurred. There is some good anticipation towards the end of the movie as to what choice - moral or otherwise - will be made with the knowledge the financial traders have at their disposal. No, I won't tell you what happened...you'll never guess!This is where America's (or specifically Hollywood) is unable to represent immorality with an American face or voice)...the principle villain is an Englishman. The voice you hear at the end of the movie, making trades, is English. Generally the hand-wringers and sobbing Sallys are American. One dramatic arc of the movie is obscure to me...why is it important that Eric Dale (played by Stanley Tucci) be located? Why must he be 'quarantined' with Sarah Robertson (played by Demi Moore) for the playing out of the firm's moral choice? The film has nothing to say on this, though I feel that it should do.Did find it ironic that highly paid Hollywood actors got to act befuddled over how much traders make in a year and whether they 'deserve' that kind of money.Also interesting was the comment by the villain-in-chief (the Englishman) that the percentage of ""winners"" and ""losers"" in the 'money game' was constant...even though there are now more of them than ever before. A strong, serious cast bring drama to a potentially dry topic.Recommendations:The ascent of money. 90% Multi-part documentary gives a forensic analysis of the GFC.Capitalism: A love story.

81,moviemanMA,Downfall,9,21 December 2011,"Margin Call is one way of examining the economic collapse in 2008. It doesn't name names or implicate certain companies, but what it does do is utilize what we know and force us to complete the picture. We follow a trading company's 24 hour meltdown. The head of risk management (Tucci) is let go from the company just as he stumbles upon an alarming trend in the company's earnings. He gives the data to one of his workers (Quinto) who in turn discovers the horrifying truth about the companies dealings.The matter goes through a series of bosses (Spacey, Baker, Irons), causing the company to come to an emergency meeting to try and figure out what to do next. Like many of us ""normal"" citizens, we woke up one morning and found that the stock market had taken a historic hit. And like ""normal"" citizens it took a while to figure out what happened and is still to an extent being explained to us (thank you Inside Job, Capitalism: A Love Story). Chandor realized this when writing and knew that a lot of the people implicated didn't quite understand what exactly they were doing. So we along with a lot of these ""high-up"" people find out from workers like Quinto that the work they have been doing was morally wrong and they are now facing one of the biggest and most dangerous decisions in US history.Chandor does an excellent job in explaining what happened without really saying for sure what happened. He puts into layman's terms the basics of what happened, but we never know exactly how the company did what the did and what they did it with (that was a mouthful). It all sounds kind of boring on paper, but when people who care about what they are talking about discuss it with passion, it becomes very interesting.Now, I am not one to get caught up with politics or news of this sort (I try to keep up on current events, emphasis on try) but I must say this was the most eye-opening explanation of the economic crisis I have seen yet. It was engrossing, enlightening, gripping, and hard to believe. Granted this is a work of fiction, I can imagine that Mr. Chandor did lots of homework in preparing to discuss this subject.I wouldn't say that there is a standout performance here (other than Chandor). This was really an ensemble effort. Each performance had to be as convincing and as strong as every other. If one link in the chain breaks off, everybody falls. If I had to pick someone that really stood apart from the rest I would give it to Spacey. I really felt that he nailed the part. We really see him change over the course of the film, yet in a way we're not sure if he ever really will change.These characters live in a culture like that of Oliver Stone's Wall Street. They waste money, try to accumulate as much money, and leave morality on the side. The work that they do involved not just numbers on a computer screen but the lives of millions of people. Their loss is a much greater loss for the general population. I found myself enraged at how some of these people think and act, but when I really thought about, they don't know any better. They've been spoiled their whole lives. It's pitiful. I honestly feel sorry that these people can't see past making a dollar than owning up to their mistake. The cast does a fantastic job in conveying this feeling. You can see the internal struggle start to manifest externally.This is probably going to be as good as it gets for fictionalizing the economic disaster or 2008. I can't see how someone could improve upon it without naming names and villainizing people and corporations. It's a disturbing film in some regards (when you look at what is actually happening), but it's a breath of fresh air as far as filmmaking. Wonderful debut by Chandor.

83,david-meldrum,Could and should be urgent and important but ultimately disappointing.,6,31 December 2014,"With a stellar cast, a heavyweight, urgent theme and a willingness to try to explain the complex in simple terms, Margin Call could have been a major film; an awards contender of relevance and importance. It isn't; it's not terrible. It's pretty good in places; it's just a let down, and more importantly doesn't so justice to the subject matter.The financial crash is one of the defining world events of recent years; as such, it should attract the thoughtful film-maker. It affects everyone; it's about the stuff in our pocket and bank accounts which affects pretty much everything about our everyday lives. However high finance, like cyber-crime, is hard to make cinematic. Most people understand it less than news reporters seem to think we do; it's a tough sell about a vital subject. Margin Call is perhaps the highest profile film to take on the subject. Set in the early days of the crash, it's the story of 24-hours in the life of a crisis hit investment bank, replete with moral dilemmas and livelihoods on the line. It has all the elements of a big film about big things. Sadly, it doesn't work. Earnest as it is, exciting as it tries to be, it's all just a little inward and a little mystifying. It doesn't do enough to really explain the high stakes of what's going on; I still felt like an outsider in a world I didn't understand. For all its excesses and faults, The Wolf Of Wall Street did far more to explain the mendacity and hedonism of high finance than Margin Call ever does. Neither are outstanding; but Scorsese's film lingers longer and deeper in the memory for all that it's about the surface and the sheen.

87,HelenMary,disappointing - less than the sum of it's parts. A damp squib.,6,23 January 2013,"For such an ensemble cast, this film was disappointing; Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Paul Bettany, Stanley Tucci and - for goodness sake - Kevin Spacey in one movie? So what went wrong?! Like Boiler Room and Wall Street, Margin Call is a film highlighting behind the scenes of the financial industry. In this case, based on true events during the start of the financial crisis in 2008, 24 hours in a trillion-dollar company that was in danger of going bust with the revelation that their trading-template ""margins"" were overshot and they were over-stretched in ""mortgages"" so far and to the tune of more than the net worth of the company. There was meltdown across the globe but it was glossed over. Yes, we know what happened, but as a film it should have used that to add tension. This should have been tense, nail-biting, and should have spelled total meltdown, bankruptcy, and with more visible effect on those it touched. So why the disappointment? Because I didn't really care about any of the characters, except perhaps the dog. They were fairly well rounded, ish, they weren't just ""bad guy"" and ""good guy"" (which I expected tbh - I expected some backbiting and dodgy dealings) and all had their reasons but the plot was so thin - other than the ""hey we've found a problem, uh-oh!"" arc - that I didn't invest (haha). You don't really learn about the characters much, you don't see their reactions particularly, at least not convincingly, and the global angle wasn't exploited. I worried that I wouldn't understand it all, and perhaps I missed something but I'm sure I got the gist enough to know what was going on. Everyone's acting was a bit staccato, even Spacey, although he did a grand job, and there was too much striding down corridors seen through glass partitions, weird scene cuts, and I found myself looking out for the discarded beer bottle! Stanley Tucci was good and the most natural, and Paul Bettany I think was the best character portrayal - he committed most - along with Spacey. Zachary Quinto was out-acted by his eyebrows (distracting), and whilst he did okay, everyone was a bit flat and I wasn't impressed en masse. Demi Moore was wildly under-utilised and I felt she was just a token woman, glamorous of course, rather than there as a fantastic actress.The script was okay - good not outstanding, a bit repetitive and the screenplay was disjointed, in my opinion, and the rest of the film couldn't carry that enough to make it arty. Cinematography was good - beautiful night-city shots but a waste of time really. Focus should have been plot, tenseness and gripping realism. You don't see the fall out, you don't really see what happens in the end and because money is still being thrown around you wonder whether it was all such a big deal when it was clearly meant to be. I expected some double dealings, some backstabbing, some insider trading to make it juicy or at least like something was happening. The trading floor ""rush"" was apparently three or four calls... and it was all a bit like a damp squib. There should have been a Boiler Room-like explosion of calls, sales people desperate to make their quota, fighting, shouting and helping each other or competing aggressively. There isn't enough grip and commitment for me as the viewer to see this lack of end-information as a cliffhanger or for dramatic effect, it's just disappointing.",Margin Call
88,Rockwell_Cronenberg,An acting showcase that runs a little thin.,6,22 October 2011,"This is a film that is sure to get some comparisons to Glengarry Glen Ross and as a deconstruction of stoic men hitting a breaking point, it does offer a similar kind of study (albeit not nearly as good) with a fantastic cast of great male actors. As it starts out, it seemed like the story was going to give some attention to the moral complexities that must have occurred with men in this position (the investment brokers on the eve of the financial crisis), but as the film progresses it turns more and more into an acting showcase with a little bit of focus on the ramifications of what they were involved in.I feel that someone like Sorkin could have given it a lot more bite, but as it stands it still works as a fine display of some solid acting skills. Paul Bettany, despite a horrendously confusing and uneven accent, gives one of the best performances of his career. Stanley Tucci isn't in it much, but he absolutely steals every scene he has. Simon Baker and Jeremy Irons are expertly ruthless and Kevin Spacey gives us a glimpse of that talent he displayed in the '90s that has been far too absent this past decade. The film peaks too early, leaving a final act that drags quite a bit, and there's a symbolic subplot with Spacey's dog that is embarrassingly heavy-handed, but it's certainly worth watching if only for the chance to watch a great male cast do their thing.",Margin Call
89,inframan,Very disappointing...,1,4 November 2011,I was really looking forward to this after reading reviews in the NY Times & other places. But one more time I got set up. I think I've been spoiled for inside looks at the workings of contemporary business by The Social Network. Where is the excitement in Margin Call? Where's the energy that has gotten these people to the precipice they're about to tumble off? The characters in this movie are so generic they could have walked out of an old Hollywood war horse like Executive Suite. It has a talented crew of actors but I never for a minute got the feeling any of them had a clue about the actual workings of the business they were in. A good part of the blame goes to the lazy script. The higher ups in these firms would have been well aware of the rocket scientists in their ranks because they were the guys hired to invent the very financial instruments that brought it all down. Here they're whiny junior analysts running financial models.,Margin Call

I care very little for a story about the financial crisis, and for the moral theme involved; but this movie does a very good job in storytelling, so that the story becomes interesting.

The direction is good, the dialogues are flawless, there's a lot of interesting characters, and the acting from an outstanding cast is fantastic.",Margin Call
91,Chris_Pandolfi,An American Tragedy,8,26 October 2011,"During the final months of 2008, most of us bore witness to a chain reaction of financial ruin. Investment firms across the country, seemingly strong, had to declare bankruptcy due mostly to the housing bubble collapse and the subsequent loss of value in real estate pricing. This brought about a shift in the economic structure so drastic, it required nothing less than a congressional bailout. It's this backdrop against which ""Margin Call"" weaves a cold and devastating yet highly compelling tale. By having it take place almost entirely within the walls of a New York investment firm, and by having the characters speak nearly indecipherable financial lingo, writer/director J.C. Chandor does something rather interesting: He completely immerses the audience in the panic and confusion of the period. To make us understand what's actually being said is not the point.As the film begins, the firm, which is unnamed but is said to be loosely based on Lehman Brothers, has just seen 80% of its employees laid off. One of the casualties is Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), the company's senior risk analyst; his opening scene, in which he's fired by a team that fires people for a living, is eerily reminiscent of ""Up in the Air,"" and about as equally timely. Just before he leaves, he hands a USB drive to a young analyst named Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) – who, for now at least, is still an employee – and instructs him (1) to analyze the data and see if he can finish what was started, and (2) to be careful. Later that night, when many of the employees are out at a bar, Peter plugs in the drive, takes one look at his computer screen, and is immediately disturbed by what he finds. He calls a fellow analyst, Seth (Penn Badgley), who then contacts their supervisor, Will (Paul Bettany), who in turn contacts his boss, Sam (Kevin Spacey). They come back to the office. They too are shocked.What exactly is on that computer screen? We don't physically see the data, but we do hear a lot of complicated fiscal jargon attempting to make sense of it. It essentially boils down to this: Their firm, as well as the entire market, is headed for disaster. The rest of the film depicts an emergency meeting at the office, one that will last the entire night. Other employees, including the easily mocked Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and a senior executive named Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), analyze the data as completed by Peter – and of course, they come to the same inescapable conclusions. The early morning hours will see the arrival of the firm's CEO via helicopter. This would be John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), who likes to speak in condescending simple terms and insists on those around him doing the same. This includes Peter, who was literally a rocket scientist at one point in his life.All throughout, most of the characters are defined by intriguing personality quirks. Seth, for example, enjoys speculating on the salaries of his superiors. He doesn't always wait for the right moment to start talking, either. Will, who alternates between smoking and anxiously chewing on pieces of nicotine gum, doesn't seem to care how off-putting his cynicism has made him. Funny, how you can grow so weary of the system and yet remain so comfortable in the lifestyle it has afforded you. In one scene on the firm's rooftop – after briefly leaning over the railing and noting that it's not about the fear of falling, but about the possibility that you'll actually jump – he explains to Seth and Peter how easily a $2 million salary can be whittled down to just over $100,000. That figure, I guess, is the wealthy man's version of the poverty line.All the characters are nicely developed, but not in any usual way. We're not made to sympathize with them. I would wager that most of them are not, properly speaking, even human beings. They're motivated not by public service or even by emotions, but by an instinctual need to keep their company afloat. Irons' character takes a disturbingly Darwinian approach to the problem: The firm will sell off their holdings before the buyers realize they have no value. It's not about loyalty to customers; it's simply about survival. The really sad thing is not that he proposed such an idea, but that everyone was resigned to it happening. A scene late in the film, a conversation between Tucci and Moore, is shockingly matter of fact in this regard.There are only two instances in which emotions get the better of the characters. One involves Seth in a bathroom stall. The other involves Sam, who is genuinely saddened by his dog's cancer diagnosis. Thematically, this reaches beyond the notion that even soulless corporate drones have the capacity for selflessness; the dog symbolizes the scarceness, frailty, and even the death of innocence. The final shot, which carries this idea even further, is tragic in more ways than one. ""Margin Call"" is nothing less than an American tragedy, especially for this very day and age, when the greed and corruption of Wall Street are foremost on everyone's minds. It will be interesting to revisit this film when and if the country is brought back on track. Will future audiences appreciate that it was made at a time when the economy was in shambles, jobs were hard to land, and all reasonable attempts at financial reform were fought against?-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Margin Call

The firm seems to have overextended itself. Now what were they going to do about it?This film featured excellent acting, and tight script, and really strong character development. You really felt you learned some of the key parts of each person within the swift 1hr40min film.It was interesting to see how the chain of command was played out, with Zach Quinto reporting to their boss Will (Paul Bettan) who reports to Sam (Kevin Spacey) who reports to Jared (Simon Baker) who finally reports to CEO Jeremy Irons. But in the end, the CEO got the straight story directly from the young Quinto. The director JC Chandor did a terrific job depicting the cut throat life on Wall St, layoffs, big money, fascination with salaries, it all revolves around money. No apologies were made for making the money, or losing the money. Perhaps you learned the most from the CEO's chat with Sam at the end. In the end, it seems with sad acceptance that we all are slaves to money in some sort. the movie is telling us that there are always winners, and losers, and you don't need to apologize for being either. This was a far superior film compared to the trashy Wolf of Wall St. Margin Call makes you think a lot about what is really important in your life at the end of the day.

Capturing the fatigue of the film's characters without ever coming across as tired itself, it is a cold reality of what life is like on the other side of the curtain.Despite constant pleadings from the characters, Margin Call's subject matter is too complex for the average viewer to absorb. Just know that bad financial stuff is happening and you'll get through it. When the screenplay isn't dabbling in financial lingo, it produces more than a few gems - mostly delivered by acclaimed cast members Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey. Of the ensemble cast there's no Daniel Plainview acting to make you take notice, but everyone does their job well and there's a few pleasant surprises in Paul Bettany and Zachary Quinto.J.C.

Not likely; it's far too generous towards an almost universally greedy sector of the economy. OK, Paul Bettany is the perfect actor - a villain playing the 'legitimate' game - that he alone gives a hint as to the unpleasantness at the heart of the financial services sector's rottenness. Spacey, Irons et al just indicate that a thick layer of very slick salesman are also implicated in the tale. Spacey in particular plays his 'burnt out trader' role perfectly. He's too old for the game he's embroiled in (Spacey's actual age is consistent with this role). Iron's too gets the right amount of arrogance and disconnection into his delivery to convince us all that he could have been presiding over the worst financial collapse in history and still not be concerned about anyone else. The film overall though is more a human story of loss - personal loss, not misery caused by greed - which ought to be the story told.",Margin Call

Cue some slower character development, unpretentious but also unimpressive directing(this film's biggest fault),decent but again unimpressive acting, and you can easily pop out to the popcorn stand for half an hour until the ""big development"" which is just a overdub of voices (none of the main actors) speaking over shots of traders selling stocks. At an hour and a half in, the movie is practically over, with nothing really happening except people in suits going to four different meetings and talking gibberish, except of course for board meeting number two, where the gibberish is explained in ""plainspeek"" for the audience to understand.. and here is my take:Big company finds out in the middle of the night that the investments they hold are worthless (meeting number 1); they explain it to the boss (meeting number 2); the boss decides that between going bust and selling the worthless stock, he wants ""to survive"" (meeting number 3); early morning, the company sells out and before the afternoon they are Wall Street's most hated scammers. Meeting number 4 is when the deal is done, and mixed feeling run amongst the traders who survived, but by ruining a lot of people.OK, so i might appreciate that this is a dramatisation of the facts that led to the banking crisis, but as for entertainment value, it's pretty low on my scale. If you are an economist or a trader, this film will bore you, as you already know all the details and then some. If you're not, then you probably won't understand much of what is going on, and you'll be bored. Boring, boring boring boring.Maybe, if this film had been given a little more spunk, more drama, stronger scenes, and consequently stretched out to several hours, it could have been a good mini-series, but as it stands, it's boring and bad.

I think a lot of people who watch this movie will be in the same boat.You don't need to understand these matters though to find this movie thoroughly engrossing. The movie never actually spells out exactly what the financial crisis at its centre is anyway. We just know it is bad. Real bad. Part of the reason we can relate to that is that these matters affected each one of us personally. How the various participants deal with the situation is a real eye opener. This movie stars a lot of big names and the acting is superb throughout. It has to be to keep we economic tyros interested. It succeeds admirably.

Going into it, I didn't expect to like it as I thought it would ask me to feel ""sympathy"" for the architects of the financial crisis... the 1%, in the parlance of our times. It didn't, however. For one thing, only one character, that played by Jeremy Irons, is ultimately a member of the afore mentioned percent. Few films I can remember point out the ways in which even the relatively privileged, besuit-ed servants of capital are themselves, in fact, working-class. They tremble at the prospect of losing their jobs, not for honor, but because, even with mid to high six figure salaries, they could end up homeless if they do not violate their conscious to satisfy their over-lords. The realization of this in popular culture is the hegemonic genius of Occupy: ""We are the 99%""- even the relatively privileged managers have more in common with the homeless than they do with the truly tiny clique of the independently wealthy. It is the realization of this on, suddenly, such a mass scale that makes me wonder if there is not the tiny possibility that, to use the terminology of one of the characters, the music might truly be ending.",Margin Call

Yes it is wordy and you need to pay attention but the acting is superb, the script sharp as tacks, and the story revealed in very matter of fact style. This is a film where we glimpse the real faces of some rather unpleasant money makers, and, because it is done so well, we do build a certain empathy with some of the characters. This is not necessarily a case of liking anyone, but more a case of respecting their role in what is being revealed to us.There are some basic economics revealed to us too, not just about the 2008 crash but in terms of how money can be made out of almost anything. We suddenly realise just how dirty the business of trading is, and just how shabby the traders are.I loved the film because it took a pretty unpromising situation and turned it into a thriller every bit as demanding of our attention as an action packed picture.

Unusually, it's a thriller set almost entirely within the confines of a New York office building. It is not a thriller of violent crime, espionage, adventure, or any of the other usual fare - rather it's a thriller of financial services...But don't be put off! This will still have you on the edge of your seat.It is an extremely well-constructed movie. The writers must have spent a fair bit of time consulting financial experts as the terminology and storyline is believably true-to-life. It follows an overnight crisis in a firm which has realised it is on the verge of collapsing and that probably the only way out is to offload tonnes of highly leveraged financial products on unsuspecting buyers the following morning.The plot follows this discovery up the company hierarchy giving ample opportunity for introducing and developing a number of characters along the way without sacrificing the sense of pace. Zachary Quinto, Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons (among others) put in great performances.Ultimately, it's hard to find much sympathy with a group of fat cats skipping a night's sleep to save their own skins and trying to justify their actions through glib comments about Wall Street's contribution to the country - but the movie is so well- written that it's genuinely exciting to watch.Highly recommended.",Margin Call

The same could be said about capitalism as an economic system. In fact, several characters imply as much in Margin Call. Is capitalism like an old dog with a tumour, bowing out on those that love it? It certainly felt like it for many during the Lehman Brothers collapse. This film does a grand job of capturing the swagger and disdain of these financial cowboys, and then their ineptitude and amorality when faced with crisis. A Wall Street firm faces ruin when a young analyst projects the devastating extent of their exposure. The key players discuss the implications, and reflect on a life of gravy to date, as night turns to day and a decision to off-load toxic assets is made. A stellar cast keep the story crackling along. Paul Bettany has never been better as the gum-addicted self-aware middle manager, whose every comment is a chess move. Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons and Stanley Tucci are phenomenal, and there is a sense of stagecraft as well as cinema running through this film. And collaboration - no one outshines anyone else (Al Pacino, take note). The camera wisely lets the actors do their thing, without drawing attention to itself. Is it all just a game that we are addicted to? Are we hypocritical in lambasting these guys, as Will suggests, for having lived off the easy credit their machinations offered up?

Writer-director J.C. Chandor (a new talent to keep your eye on) tells this important story in microcosm, by focusing on a single, ordinary New York investment banking firm. A stellar cast, comprising the likes of Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore and Paul Bettany act their socks off in what looks like a drama but feels like a thriller. Out of the blue and for no reason, 80-percent of the staff are given their marching orders. One of them is Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) who, before he leaves, hands whippersnapper Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) a memory stick containing statistics so dangerous he cautions him to 'be careful'. What's on this stick? The end of the world, of course. No, seriously: apocalypse. Their firm, like so many others across the world, were selling mortgages to any Tom, Dick and Harry, and ignored the obvious repercussions. They were awarding themselves obscene pay packets and million-dollar bonuses at the same time. The bubble had to burst at some point. And it did. The boys upstairs, the ones with sharper suits and darker tans, are immediately called in to conduct twilight boardroom meetings to agree a damage-limitation strategy. No one is safe. Not even the ones agreeing the strategy.All the banking speak is necessary for the illusion, but Chandor does his best to keep things simple for us. Apart from being entertained by it, 'Margin Call' taught me a few things. Chandor remains neutral while his characters give us both sides of the argument for risky banking.Paul Bettany's character delivers a scathing diatribe against 'normal people', who he says are only able to live the high life because of the risks bankers like him take. That's the argument for. Peter, a former rocket scientist, who only entered this racket because the money was easy, confesses that their exorbitant salaries are unjustified and unsustainable. That's the argument against. Irons and Spacey, two acting titans on top form, share a number of riveting scenes. Both know how monumental this mess is, but Spacey takes it personally, while Irons cares only for survival. Irons justifies his insouciance by reeling off dates of previous recessions, implying the cycle will never end. 'We just can't help ourselves', he says, indifferently. That's the 'Who cares?' argument.www.moseleyb13.com",Margin Call

This firm is the first to take action.A quant in risk management is fired in a routine blood bath. On his way out, he turns over his work to a young man who is an actual rocket scientist. When the rocket scientist finishes the work later that night, he discovers the peril facing the firm and the investment world.""Margin Call"" is all offices, board rooms and executive angst. Large sums of money are discussed in between the moral questions about what is about to happen. The participants always, always, always take the money. If there is a portion of the very fine script that is least convincing, it is the time these predators spend wrestling over questions of ethics. One would hope that those questions bothered at least some executives on Wall Street. Ethics only frame questions. One must be a moral person to do the right things. Of course, no one does.Emergency meetings take place in the dead of night, and a plan to dump worthless assets on the investment world takes shape. Intelligent, urbane, rich scoundrels decide they can't help themselves. Each of them decides for themselves reasons have for taking the money and passing the massive pile of offensive fecal matter onto the rest of the world.There is a sense that this film reaches into the black hearts of geniuses who blew up the financial world in 2008. This battle of good versus evil seems too quiet. We are accustomed to our world coming to an end with explosions and bullets.

Great or even good art, this was not.That stated, the financial venture part of the movie's history (reported in a Wikipedia article about the movie) is worth a close look.The project was cleverly executed, done quickly for a roughly $3 million dollar budget, and made 5 times that much (roughly $16 million dollars) by the time was finished being shown in movie houses.The movie is clever....tricky is also a good word to describe it.It features very famous and skilled actors and was shot in one location mostly in roughly one month (July 2010) in New York City, mostly.The famous actors part of the movie included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons (both Best Actor Academy Award Winners), Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci.All heavyweights, all actors probably paid a lot of money up front from the $3 Million dollar budget, which otherwise was done on shoestring money remarked on repeatedly and continually by the director, Mr. J. C. Chandor, during the interesting and worth listening to ""director's commentary"" special feature part of the movie available in the DVD home version.The project was thrifty in ways movies can be and have been often in the past. This meant six figure figures (maybe large six figure figures) could be paid up front to Spacey, Irons, Moore, and Tucci.Everybody else probably got peanuts and glory, and maybe deferred payment agreements (which when honored were likely good.....those paid in deferred money had roughly $13 million dollars to divide at least part of).What was the result which turned a profit of roughly $13 million dollars for $3 million dollar up front investment? Well........the movie did the ""Curse Of The Cat People"" (1943) thing of being a film noir type movie with the ""unknown monster in the closet"" dangled through most of the movie ....and dangled skillfully by expert actor danglers (Spacey, Irons, Tucci, Moore).It took advantage of the fact most people don't understand Wall Street and big banker gobble-dee-gook terminology, and presented a corporate crisis meltdown scenario where the reason the corporation of ""suits"" faced bad times was never clearly explained....in spite of the (cynical) repeated phrase ""explain that to me in plain English"" (never really done) when the ""what's the problem?"" question is asked and answered.The audience never has the question answered of why there is ""trouble in River City with a capital 'T'."" ""MBS's"" (mortgage based securities) are mentioned in passing, always as an initial-ism.""MBS's"" are reported as the reason Lehman Bros. and Bear Sterns went under in 2008, and Goldman Sachs survived somehow.But not in this movie......the Wikipedia ""Margin Call Movie"" article mentions it briefly.People who don't check the Wikipedia description don't learn that.Viewers just learn the company is in trouble and people have to stay up several days and nights in a row facing terrible threats possibly disastrous.These people are all rich (big money incomes are mentioned repeatedly in the script), so they face losing a lot and that is, for dramatic purposes, more tragic than, say, an entire group in a MacDonald's hamburger stand location employees and managers facing loss of income and unemployment.The fact this is the message of the movie is part of the reason why I gave it low grades as a piece of art or valuable script writing.This movie is all about style and technique (delivered well by the big money actors well showcased in the simple film noir show presented), and piggybacking onto the headlines people don't understand about ""Wall Street In Trouble"" (esp. the 2008 crisis widely headlined and reported, never explained well anywhere.......every try to read the book titled ""Too Big To Fail"" (2010) by Andrew Sorkin about it all? Good luck to you!).""Margin Call"" (2011) is the movie equivalent to an avant Gard stage play presented on a bare stage with a black velvet background curtain, four fold-up chairs, an a hanging light-bulb where very good actors present a story showing they are all in trouble, and act, skillfully, in troubled ways saying troubled things.""No Exit"" by Jean Paul Sartre (done often by college drama depts. looking for drama without big stage design and costume bills) is an example of this kind of animal.Well.......""No Margin"" (2011) made a lot of money relative to it's investment ($13 million dollars profit after repaying an initial investment of $3 million).Not bad.The movie itself is no big deal, even with the heavyweight actors part of it.....it's like the old joke about Chinese restaurants, and being hungry half an hour after you eat in one.It's not satisfying and it's not substantial, and people who label it with 10 stars (very many where it is reviewed by the hundreds who took time to do that) have low standards.But so what? These are times of low standards, and democracy in movie reviewing is urged on us by the likes of Amazon.Com and it's wholly owned subsidiary website, IMDb.Com.People with low standards buy things, and that includes doubtful movies like ""Margin Call"" (2011).Meanwhile, Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci get paid enough to continue living the good life of rich movie stars, and only a tiny percentage of movies any of them work in are truly good movies.--------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG movie actor.

111,chaz-28,A phenomenal ensemble cast is a joy to watch but a cumbersome script & marketing itself as a true story doesn't work,5,23 October 2011,"Margin Call's poster shows in bold print the words ""Inspired by a True Story."" Eh Set in a fictional brokerage firm in 2008 just before the housing bust, it appears to be very loosely based on Lehman Brothers. Opening strongly, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) is ushered into a conference room to meet with people who he has never met before who thank him for his 19 years of service to the company but he is being let go and will now be escorted to the front door by security, but really, thank you for your service. In a slight nod to the territory covered by Up in the Air, the film follows neither the nameless administrators who just did the firing or the shocked new unemployed banker. On his way out the door, Eric tosses a data stick to his young protégé Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) and tells him to take a look at it and to ""be careful."" Peter is a young guy who doesn't mind burning the midnight oil to get ahead in the firm but also has mixed feelings about the way his boss was just unceremoniously ushered out of the building. Taking a look at the date file, Peter discovers Eric was onto something big. Apparently, his firm, and also all of Wall Street, is about to fall off a cliff and go bankrupt because of some newly discovered toxic assets. From following the news the last few years, the audience is well aware Peter just figured out the securities which the banking industry has been trading based on lousy home mortgages is about to send everyone to the poor house.Peter calls his new boss Will (Paul Bettany) who call his boss Sam (Kevin Spacey) who calls his boss Jared (Simon Baker) who calls his boss John (Jeremy Irons). These higher up bosses are names Peter has only distantly heard of, the kind of bosses who do not routinely come into the office and only show up in the columns of the Wall Street Journal. Explaining over and over again what he has stumbled across is not easy for the audience to follow. The script deliberately sticks with convoluted business speak which only a skilled MBA holder would be able to follow. Even when the big boss John asks Peter to explain it to him like he is talking to a golden retriever, the explanations is still muddled and it is only because we are in 2011 instead of 2008 that we are able to kind of figure out what is going on.Now that everyone realizes what the problem is, what will they do about it? They are the first firm on Wall Street to figure it out, but probably not for long. Enter the ethics debate and the prisoner's dilemma. If the firm goes to the press or to the other banking firms, they will take an enormous loss along with the rest of them, maybe even going bust. If they sell all of these toxic assets the next day, they will spark a panic, an SEC investigation, and severely cripple their reputation, but they won't go broke. However, in shoveling their junk investments to other firms, they will set their brethren up for failure.The vast majority of all of these conversations and worried looks take place in one building from secret basement rooms to the roof. Most of the action also takes place in one night as the bosses try to balance ethics, secrets, and most of all, profits before the opening trading bell strikes. The script is sharp, but the relentless banking jargon tries one's patience. Also, the claim that it was inspired by a true story is a pretty far reach. There was no magic moment on Wall Street when one young guy sat down and figured out the recession was going to start the next day. No firm pulled an all-nighter and sparked the crisis. Lehman Brothers had a gigantic meltdown, but it wasn't because they stumbled onto the truth and decided to lead-turn the panic.Margin Call's greatest asset is its cast. It is an independent film, but you would not know that by looking at the cast. Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, and Stanley Tucci all knock it out of the park and lend a huge dramatic weight to what could have been a very dry and eye-gouging script. Demi Moore, Simon Baker, and Penn Badgley are also along for the ride but noticeably do not measure up to their peers listed above. I am not saying they deliver poor performances, but someone is going to come in second fiddle to Jeremy Irons.I do not actually recommend this film even though the cast will most likely be strong nominees for any ensemble cast award this season. The script is too cumbersome and the idea that first time film writer and director J.C. Chandor tries to play this story off as true is too unbelievable by far. When it comes to films about the downfall of the banking industry, it is best to stick with the superior documentaries such as Inside Job and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.",Margin Call

113,donb-519-335075,A sad commentary on the human condition,9,25 November 2012,"Rarely have I seen a movie which better depicts the greed, corruption, and moral ambiguity involved in modern corporate business - especially in the world of finance - than this movie. This film reinforces what many people think of business - and unfortunately on some levels, they are not wrong. Some businesses have only one thing in mind - their gain - and that is the only thing in the mind of some of the corporate big wigs.Margin Call has a great cast - especially Stanley Tucci, Kevin Spacey, Zachary Quinto, and Jeremy Irons. Kevin Spacey's role is interesting as he often plays the role of the ""prime mover"" - the guy who is in total control of everything - in a very sly and understated way (see Usual Suspects and Seven as prime examples). And at one level he is still in control - convincing his Staff to do a morally reprehensible task - while it is clear in this movie that he is only a small cog in the wheel and that he is at the mercy of the system and its greed - so he really is not in control. The key line at the end of the movie is when he agrees to go along with the company's plans because ""I need the money.""One of the things i liked most about this film is that the tension builds like a scene working up to the big gunfight in a Western. And when the deed is done, it is sad, but not surprising to see many young ""innocents"" getting sucked into the system - because their greed is being fed.Everyone gets played in this movie - especially the young analysts and the customers of the corporation. Thjs may or may not have been the way the crash of 2008 went down, but I'm sure the motives and moral destitution which it portrays were present. And the sad thing is they remain today.In the America of 2012 many politicians are playing on the ""Middle class"" fear and loathing of people who are only out for themselves. Their pronouncements and promises are laughable to me, as there is no system more corrupt or self serving that the American political process. So, we are voting into office those who are pretending to look for for us - what a joke. This movie has been made a couple of times using politics as the venue. Those movies show how political leaders lead people astray by their false, but persuasive rhetoric. (Can you say Josef Goebbels?) Unfortunately the majority of the American public does not really care or is too stupid to understand the real motives of our ""leaders"" be they in business, politics, or wherever.The only thing we can do is not become part of this culture of corruption. Treat people with respect, and honestly. Be prepared to stand tall in front of your Maker come the final days. It will happen whether you believe it or not.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the human condition and in the moral sacrifices that people make in a effort to get ahead.

114,Kicino,Surviving on the margin,8,30 May 2012,"What a thriller this is. With an excellent ensemble of cast, the suspension started from the beginning and lingered on and stayed even after the movie ended. It was almost like a mysterious or suspense novel except there was no blood and no murder. But the deadly and ruthless means these guys used were probably more brutal than a blatant murder. What's worse, a murder only affects a limited number of people; whatever people did in this building on this day affect millions of people, across the global, and corrupted the inner state of the action takers. That rippling effect made it even more haunting.Since there were not a lot dramatic scenes/visual effects, we as audience had to rely largely on acting skills and a well written script to experience the chilling effects. Following the director, we got to know each character and understand their motivation (mostly money in addition to using their skills wisely). Eventually we met the culprits who, had some struggles one way or the other, seemed to have no choice and led us into this mess.Superb use of analogy when Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), the smart rocket scientist-turned associate walked out of the building for some air in the middle of the night: the environment or the company was too suffocating. Despite his intelligence, there were still so many things he did not understand, politically and realistically. When John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) was chewing meat at breakfast and talking about how he got to where he was, we saw a cold-blooded killer who did not care how others struggle if he himself could survive. In the end, ibanking as portrayed here is almost like corruption or the mafia: you cannot fight against them. The only way to survive is to join them, even though it might mean against your will, even though it might rot you eventually. It is brutal, hopeless and helpless but seems inevitable.What a waste of talents. These people could build bridges and rockets and improve people's lives. But we have lured them with outrageous money and bonus and threatened them with family safety to invent some complicated models to rip off innocent people's life savings and vaporize their investments. It is not just the glamorous lifestyle. It is not necessarily greed. When loyalty to the company, integrity and morality are all mixed up and twisted, humanity is easily eroded. Margin Call particularly hit us well with the ever-evolving financial crisis. This movie can be enjoyed more if we read ""Justice"" by Michael Sandler. To get more background of the MBS and ABS, see ""Inside Job."" The contamination of humanity in a big corporation/industry is comparable to the Japanese classic ""Shiroi Kyotou (The White Tower).""",Margin Call
115,Katz5,Chilling Ensemble Piece,9,9 June 2021,"A lot of reviewers seem to prefer the slick, Hollywood approach to Wall Street stories, from ""Wall Street"" and its mostly forgotten 2010 sequel, to ""The Big Short."" But ""Margin Call"" is the real deal - and gets to the very heart of the matter in the hours before the 2008 crash. Set almost entirely at night (the night before that fateful day), the viewers get a glimpse into what makes this successful Wall Street firm tick: The young risk analyst Peter Sullivan, who has a degree in rocket science, but took the job because the ""money was much more attractive"" (compared to what he studied); his ambitious young colleague Seth, whose only goal in life was to become a rich trader; Will Emerson, the nicotine-addicted head of credit trading; Sarah Robertson, a chief risk management officer; Jared Cohen, division chief; Sam Rogers, trading floor senior manager; and the big cheese himself, John Tuld, firm CEO.Other characters float in and out of view, but these are the main players....along with Eric Dale, head of risk management under Sam, who is fired near the beginning of the film as the firm goes through a purging to cut corners. While leaving in an elevator, Eric hands Peter, the rocket scientist analyst, a flash drive with an ominous warning: ""Be careful.""The film takes off from there. While ""The Big Short"" spelled out the crisis in a manner that any viewer, including those who find Wall Street trading as foreign a concept as translating hieroglyphics, could understand (and therefore was a more financially successful film), ""Margin Call"" gets into the nitty gritty. The night unfolds with increasing anxiety for all involved, except John Tuld, who keeps reassuring his troops they will be fine in the end. Of course the majority of the population won't, but it's not of his concern - nor is it of concern to some of his staff with similar questionable ethics (such as Jared Cohen).The other main characters deal with the impeding disaster in different ways. Sam's dog is dying of liver cancer and the dog's death serves as a metaphor as to how he views his chosen profession. The film ends with him buying the dog in the front yard of the home of his estranged wife. No happy endings here for sure.The acting in the film is nothing short of brilliant. J. C. Chandor gets believable and sympathetic performances from all - even the actors who play the less- than-moral characters. How can you lose with Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons heading the cast (as Sam and John, respectively). Think what you will about Spacey following his fall from Hollywood grace - he is a great actor. The scenes with his dog are heartbreaking and Spacey conveys it all in his face. Irons doesn't turn John Tuld into a villain of Claus von Bülow (or even Scar from The Lion King) proportions. He was tasked to save the firm. Whatever the cost. And he does it with pleasant yet icy efficiency.It's nice to see Demi Moore back, although her Hollywood revival seemed short-lived. She also conveys much with her body language and facial expressions in a firm where employees are highly paid not to express any emotions. Paul Bettany, as the Nicorette--and then cigarettes--addicted Will, and the always reliable Stanley Tucci (as Eric, whose simple line ""be careful"" casts a dark spell over the entire movie) round out the main cast.Chandor went on to direct Robert Redford's one-man show ""All is Lost,"" as well as the ambitious but deeply flawed ""A Most Violent Year."" ""Margin Call"" is the best of the three, as uplifting as a David Mamet character study but endlessly fascinating and addictively watchable.",Margin Call
116,RMS1949,Boring script,4,24 October 2011,"Actors seemed in top form to delivery, it was too bad the writers never matched their intensity. The film wanted to give us a personal glimpse into the final day decision making of a financial firm about to go under because of poor marketing decisions. The recent Wall Street collapse was due to people just not caring as long as their bookkeeping showed profits and they got their bonus checks. They played games with other people's money so they never felt no personal attachment or responsibility. We get that. They felt more sympathy for their other greedy buyers than the poor people who would lose benefits and retirement funds due to job losses and stock and investment plunges.In the end who really cares about the lives of these heartless almost robotic creatures anyway.

117,Artemis-9,And the Oscars don't go to... Margin Call,10,11 March 2012,"I'll concede this picture is not better than The Artist (Best Picture Oscar 2012), but it's damn much closer than the competing nominees.Kevin Spacey in Margin Call (2011) goes through a number of inner changes with flying colours, and less make-up and wardrobe aids than Jean Dujardin (Actor in a leading role Oscar 2012).Demi Moore in Margin Call shows a bit of leg and a big talent, both saying her lines and when she has no lines to say - which in my book is at least nomination material comparable if not better than, the cloning of an iron lady with due respect to Maryl Streep (Actress in a leading role Oscar 2012).Paul Bettany is surprisingly good as a top villain, and that should have been awarded instead of keeping rewarding established names like Christopher Plummer (Actor in a supporting role Oscar 2012).I'll not contend that Mary McDonnell's work in Margin Call, reduced to a marginal role of 3 minutes at best, was better than the much helpful support by Octavia Spencer in The Help (Actress in a supporting role Oscar 2012). And yet you won't forget her role, soon.New York by night was never so well photographed than by Frank G. DeMarco, but he lost it to a common x-effects based work as Emmanuel Lubezki's The Tree of Life got it (Cinematography Oscar 2012).John Paino and Robert Covelman created dull office spaces that we endure for over 100 minutes without feeling bored (24 hours in an office building, that's something!), allowing for fluidity of movement of actors and cameras alike. They create realism that is more difficult than the fantastic scenarios of Hugo by Dante Ferretti and Francesca LoSchiavo (Art Direction Oscars 2012 for Production Design and Set Decorator).Carolin Duncan may have done a discreet job, but each actor and actress is dressed up - or down - according to the moment with precision and respect for him/her status in the organization - deserving as much as Mark Bridges with his glamorous The Artist (Costume Design Oscar 2012).What did J.C. Chandor lack to deserve an award in comparison to the rather trivial (excuse me!) Michel Hazanavicius? (Directing Oscar 2012).Pete Beaudreau did a wonderful job, so as you won't notice is presence in Margin Call - what would have been a good reason to award him instead of maybe Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall (Film Editing Oscar 2012).I'd have elected Erin Ayanian and Fabiola Arancibia for their work on Demi Moore, rather the overdone makeup of Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland on their Iron Lady (Makeup Oscar 2012).Nathan Larson discreet, varied, mood creation, imaginative music certainly beats the expected score by Ludovic Bourse (Original Score Oscar 2012), and probably all other nominees, hands down.Most of all, J.C. Chandor was robbed of award and nomination for his original screenplay that is what the people should be exposed to, to understand the reality of the last three years with a perspective that goes through 7 centuries, with a dialogue that all actors delivery naturally, because they were very careful written by someone who knew what he was writing about! Several dialogues of this screenplay should be mandatory study in Acting and Finance Schools. So, with due respect to the old hand of Woody Allen (Original Screenplay Oscar 2012) I'll contend that the nominee Chandor should have got the trophy.Summing up: 1. I do not understand how come Margin Call did not get a single statuette. 2. I am confirmed in my conceited opinion that good movies are rarely rewarded by the Oscar crowd.PS - This film is rated R, probably because of the repeated use of the F**k word, despite the characters saying the expletive or the verb are subjected to unbearable psychological and economic pressure.

He throws the (usb-)stick with the data to Quinto with the words ""be careful"". Quinto works on the data and finds out, what could be the start of a REAL thriller. Instead the audience is getting a movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a thriller or an interesting documentary fiction of the financial crisis. Another lack of the story is that it doesn't have a lead character. Every character is allowed to bring up his feeling and/or motivations as if to show all the humans behind the media-generated mask of banksters. There is nobody to sympathize with even. Kevin Spacey's character is given the biggest opportunity to create such sympathy or interest. The most memorable scene though is where the audience is tempted to think that he is about to cry because of having to let so many people go, while it turns out that actually his dog is dying. My bet is, that the excellent cast of actors got lured in by a promise of making something like ""Wall Street"".

A knowledge of mortgage-backed securities is not required in order for you to enjoy this movie, If, however, you enjoy compelling performances in a tightly-paced, intelligently written and emotionally powerful movie, you'll enjoy this film. An especially intriguing aspect of this movie is that it remains keenly focused on the three classical Aristotelian unities of drama: unity of action (the story remains centered on the imminent demise of the American economy), unity of place (the vast majority of the action occurs within one firm's corporate office), and unity of time (all of the action takes place in one 24-hour period.). The film's crowning achievement is its ability to depict the human drama, anxiety, and uncertainty that led to and resulted from the economic mess we're all coping with today. ""Margin Call"" belongs to a very rare genre—the economic thriller—and it succeeds mainly due to its brilliant script (by writer/director J.C.

It also leads to some reflections about our actions during that period.The performances are solid and the story is good. Different people in a company are faced with a crisis that can take the whole company down. I am not sure if I understand it fully but basically it is a choice of morality - whether to sell the ""soon-valueless"" stocks to the market and saving the company.Indeed, what makes the film good is not the plot itself, but the different attitudes of the depicted characters towards such a decision. Some think it's the only choice to ""win"" the game while some think it is an action that can only temporarily save the corporation but ruining the name of the company. With the foundation of good acting, the film succeeds in showing us the different purposes and conflicts.While this is not really a thriller that has a certain explosion of climax, the tense environment created is realistic enough to convince viewers. I'd have to conclude that this is a good thriller, but definitely not for everyone.

This one went a step further, and gifted us with a great story as well.Basically, over a period of more or less 24 hours, you see the inner machinations of a business run by people you may see every day ... who I'd like to think are nothing like real people (but know better).

131,TheMovieSnob247,Be first. Be Smarter. Or cheat.,8,12 June 2014,"A pleasant surprise, Margin Call is fantastic. A star studded cast from top to bottom with really good, intense performances (Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons are in top form) that will leave you a little conflicted.This thriller is based on the recent mortgage crisis in the same vein as Inside Job (which was also excellent). The film captures a 24 hour window where a Wall Street firm realizes that the financial market is about to implode and the subsequent carnage that follows. The night in which it all goes down is the perfect back drop for all the backstabbing, greed, cold hearted decisions and outright deception that follows. Just about everything that is wrong with unrestrained capitalism (and human nature) is on display here and this is driven home by a really solid cast.While I'm not sure how accurate this is (it's based on a true story), I don't really think it's that far off from what I'm sure happened at a few investment firms during the financial crisis. To it's credit however, the film isn't overly preachy and it doesn't present the scenario in black and white. It presents it in a realistic and honest way, in shades of grey. This is very underrated and one of the best movies I've seen about greed. As John (Jeremy Irons) says in the film: ""We just can't help ourselves"". Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

132,johnklem,Almost perfect,8,25 May 2012,"Margin Call begins as a thriller and finishes with a scene of utter alienation. Along the way, Jeremy Irons, Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany deliver some of their best performances, as do Zachary Quinto, Simon Baker et al. It says a lot for how much the movie has going for it that Stanley Tucci feels underused. There's so much talent at work here that Mary McDonnell, a two-time Oscar nominee, only gets a couple of (crucial) lines at the very end. The whole enterprise reminded me of Conspiracy, the Kenneth Branagh film about the Wansee Conference. If Margin Call has a weakness, it's in the pacing. The problem lies with the great sell-off. It's the climax, the battle that we've been building towards, preparing for and we are denied it. The day is covered in a few sound bites and some more time lapse footage of NYC. I suspect that budget was the real issue here but it's a shame. Rather than shoot a long complex series of trading floor scenes, it could have been covered quickly and cheaply from within the offices of the principals. The rest of the film is so strong that David Denby in The New Yorker called it the best film ever about Wall Street. I wouldn't disagree. It's just that it could have been even better. And that final scene? One critic called it maudlin. He couldn't have been more wrong. Pay close attention.

133,bobzmcishl,Authentic portrayal of amoral Wall Street,8,5 February 2012,"This may not be the ultimate movie about the great financial debacle of 2008, but it will have to suffice. Although the movie does a good job of laying out complex financial issues that led to major breakdowns in our financial institutions, it does help if one has read any of the myriad books about what happened in the Summer of 2008, especially the fall of Lehman Brothers which must have been the investment bank they were using as a model for their fictional bank. Even the CEO names are similar, ""Tuld"" versus ""Fuld"". The movie does in good job in detailing the pecking order at financial institutions, the trading desks being where the action is, and the risk management function being an afterthought until the roof starts to cave in. The film does a great job in explaining how quickly a financial firm can spin willdly out of control when their carefully crafted models begin to not reflect the reality of what is really going on in the market place, and it is apparent that senior management has no plan B to deal with a pending catastrophe. What happens in Margin Call is what happened to Lehman Brothers. The movie doesn't cover the eventual collapse but only the first 24 or so hours of the discovery of news so bad the CEO had to helicopter in in the middle of the night. The film could have been a real bore except for the real life events it mirrors, the exceptional screenplay, and the uniformly fine acting. The film doesn't pick sides but shows the mindset of how highly paid people who work in key positions on Wall Street think when faced with a calamity that was destined to happen.",Margin Call
134,don2507,"""It's the Right Thing to do"" ""For Whom?"" Tension Inside a Big Wall Street Firm",10,6 September 2012,"Margin Call is a mesmerizing film with a brilliant and intelligent script and an outstanding performance by Jeremy Irons as the investment bank's CEO as well as very good performances by Kevin Spacey and Simon Baker as the firm's executives. The film's brilliance is all the more remarkable as it's a self-described low-budget film made in NYC over little more than a two-week period with a first-time director, J.C. Chandor; however, the exemplary quality of the script (written by Chandor as well) is signified by the fact that Chandor and his producers were able to attract such an all-star cast by that very script and how well it portrays the senior levels of a Wall Street firm as the financial crisis of 2008 approaches. The film depicts, with increasing tension, 24 hours in the life of a generic investment bank (perhaps a Bear Stearns) as risk analysts uncover massive and heretofore hidden losses in its mortgage-backed securities positions (aka ""toxic assets""), the executives are informed and then argue among themselves about what to do and how to save the firm.Now I readily admit that I'm a corporate finance guy who, though not a Wall Streeter himself, has had years of experience dealing with Wall Street firms and has visited their trading floors on occasion, and the film is spot-on in depicting the language and hyper-competitiveness of these firms and the individuals within them who strive to make money from unpredictable markets on a daily basis. It's no surprise, however, since the specials in the DVD indicate that the director / writer's father worked for Merrill Lynch for 39 years and took him to Merrill's trading floor numerous times when he was a child. Chandor reveals that he had no interest in following his father to Wall Street and instead wanted to make films, and based on Margin Call he's made a wise decision.Margin Call has a dark lighting to it as most of its ""action"" takes place at night, and the omnipresent power of the markets over these individuals and this firm is suggested by the ever-present flickering Bloomberg terminals behind or near almost every speaker in the film. The moral focus involves the executives' decision to sell the ""toxic"" assets to unsuspecting investment firms and thereby save (hopefully) the firm as it is effectively insolvent with its carried losses totally absorbing the market value of its equity. The head of trading fights this as he knows it will destroy the trust, perhaps for years, that his traders have established with their counterparties, and there's a marvelous scene during the big sell-off near the end of the film where the voices of the targeted buyers on the other end of the phone offer lower and lower prices and sound angrier and angrier at the firm's duplicity. But after all, the CEO has told his head trader: ""it's not a panic if you're first"".It's very easy to intensely dislike most of these individuals, but the script is more subtle; it gives them reasonable and thoughtful, albeit cynical, arguments for what they do, and what they're about to do. The recurring nature of financial panics is alluded to, and it's suggested that there will always be ""winners and losers"". There are some hints of doubts as to the social utility of finance capitalism with the fired risk manager remembering his earlier days as a civil engineer when he built bridges and saved countless hours of commuting time, with the implication that the social usefulness of his application of those same quantitative skills to financial markets is less identifiable. I could argue that financial markets offer the useful ability to price and transfer risk, and that speculative market participants provide the liquidity for risk hedgers to utilize, but speculative excesses, and the tendency for speculators to dominate certain markets, seem to be endemic in the Wall Street culture of today, and as this film so brilliantly depicts, the social and economic consequences of that dominance seem to be a matter of little concern, outside of their own firm, to those who run the titans of finance capitalism.",Margin Call

What I find hard to fathom is exactly what the objective, the target of the film is.Anyone with half a brain knows how the financial world got so far up its own backside over the last decade or two that it was completely unsustainable (If you don't understand an investment steer very clear of it). So as a morality tale it is somewhat outdated. Yet it doesn't have the flash-bang action - thank God - in today's style. So how did the director see it? I would dearly like to know.Two scenes encapsulate, for me, how the story doesn't go anywhere: in one scene, outside Eric's house when they are trying to get him to return to the office, a large black MafiaMobile draws threateningly to a halt the other side of the road. It's actually mentioned, so one assumes that something nasty is going to be associated with it - yet that's it! I suppose it does give a little frisson of expectation, but to no effect.And Spacey's dog. We see his emotional side - but not with a wife, family: his b****y dog. At the end we see him burying his dog - then up scroll the credits.

138,lampic,Jeremy Irons is God,8,31 July 2015,"""Margin Call"" deals with big, multi-million firm and countless anonymous little fishes who are satisfied with their jobs until disaster strikes. In space of 36 hours the whole empire collapses and we follow what happens to individuals involved in all this - what is the most interesting is how firmly movie keeps our attention although there is nothing in sense of ""action"" (no explosions, overturned cars, bullets or computer animation), we are glued to the screen by sheer power of story and presence of strong acting. From a recently fired Stanley Tucci who stumbled upon discovery that would alarm his young colleague (Zachary Quinto), to cold blooded executive Simon Baker and finally the biggest fish Jeremy Irons (who arrives in the middle of the night by helicopter and orders immediate meeting) acting is superb and there is hardly a wrong step in a movie - these people are not sentimental when it comes about outside world and what will happen to others, they are concerned about their own wealth and how will all of this affect them. There is a excellent scene where Baker and Demi Moore bicker in the elevator completely ignoring cleaning lady who is in the middle - for them she is invisible, she is perfect example of outside world they don't care about and I doubt they would even notice if she dropped dead there and than. Not so sure about Moore and why exactly she was needed for this movie except for her name power but Jeremy Irons brings everything on completely different level because his presence is so hypnotizing and yes scary, that he completely overshadows everybody else around - we sense this is important man who is completely above other mortals and even when everybody else is scared to death because of collapse of financial empire, Irons stands unconcerned because his own wealth is such that he can just shrug it off as something natural and cyclical.

141,knowyourmovie,"An unevenly executed, but smart and talented speculation that is quite possibly fairly true to life ...",7,24 June 2012,"""Margin Call"" suffered the same fate as many good movies before and after it - being almost completely overlooked by the general public, busily preoccupied with the latest primitive cheesy popcorn blockbuster. For those tired of painfully experiencing the fussing around cartoonish ""Avengers"", for those, exhausted from slowly suffering through the endless boring ""Hunger games"", ""Margin Call"" offers something different – flawed, very far from perfect, but still closer to the realm of art than your average Hollywood mass production.The main character in ""Margin Call"" is not a person, but rather a very interesting and an intriguing social and cultural phenomenon: Wall Street. Wall Street is a well-established and valuable brand in popular culture. Not surprisingly therefore, over the years, Hollywood has made several noteworthy attempts to do what it does best: milk the ""Wall Street"" brand and turn it into a cash cow. Fortunately, one of the best and unique qualities of the movie is its freshness, its peculiar, almost naive innocence, and sincerity, possibly explained by the fact that ""Margin Call"" is a debut work of its writer- director J.C. Chandor.Not only does the movie not have any apparent hidden agenda, but it also does not look like its author was too much into a greedy moneymaking or a narcissistic awards gathering. Instead, J.C. Chandor was indeed attempting to focus on something truly important, to take an entertaining enough, but still long, hard, comprehensive and honest look at the various Wall Street characters in the times of crisis - from lowly financial analysts to powerful CEOs.Was that attempt successful? Yes and no. On one hand, ""Margin Call"" is definitely an interesting movie that is worth checking out. It is for the most part entertaining, intriguing, suspenseful, and even gripping thriller with a meaningful subject. On the other hand, however, the movie has several significant flaws, and the source of most of its flaws as it often happens is the same as the source of the most of its virtues – the writer-director being a relative novice in the profession and in Hollywood in particular.The questionable editing additionally worsens the uneven writing and directing of ""Margin Call"". As a result, here and there the smart and original scenes randomly and unexpectedly alternate the ones that are clichéd, boring, unnecessary or lead nowhere. Moreover, ""Margin Call"" bears a touch of an unnatural bookishness. One time it would clumsily put the author's reflections in a character's mouth, the other time it would explicitly reveal the deep motivations of a character or would make the characters expose their inner thoughts, yet other time it would feature some other intimate details that in a real life conversation would remain implied and unspoken.Some of the characters in the movie seem to be less authentic than others. For example, the character of Sam Rogers – the head of trading - does not come across as a particularly realistic and coherent. The author noticeably tried to create something complex, deep and credible with such an underwhelming result that even Kevin Spacey was mostly helpless in reviving the stillborn image.The smart story evidently attracted many good actors that star in the movie and yet it almost looked like due to a lack of experience the novice director failed to make all these stars work in harmony with each other, to create an integrated ensemble from a group of very talented but very different individuals with unique personalities.As a result, we notice some discord, dissonance, lack of cohesion in the acting. My personal favorite is a reserved, but expressive and powerful performance of Simon Baker as a firm division head. Demi Moore was surprisingly good in the role of the chief risk management officer and Stanley Tucci was great as usual in the role of her subordinate. I felt that venerable Jeremy Irons went slightly over the top in his showy and charismatic portrayal of John Tuld - the CEO of the respectable Wall Street firm. He ended up being almost more charismatic than the late Steve Jobs himself. Personally, I truly enjoyed the Jeremy Irons' captivating performance, but real life CEOs are probably more boring and much less fun to watch. Zachary Quinto, in my opinion, was a miscasting for the role of a junior risk. He applied every effort to create a believable character, but all in vain. I could be wrong, but it almost looked like the movie subject turned out to be a little foreign to him and he ended up being somewhat lost in it.I cannot help but mention something that irritated and upset me personally – the outrageous pervasive profanity. Some fragments of the film are better in that respect than the others, but at certain times, when ""f-word"" is spoken in almost every sentence ""Margin Call"" can become utterly disgusting and almost completely intolerable. Being unfamiliar with the life, customs, and manners of Wall Street traders, I cannot say whether this aspect of the movie is true to life or not. However, even this is how they truly behave, filling so liberally the otherwise intelligent movie with such a strong profanity does not seem justifiable or acceptable to me. Finally, even though J.C. Chandor undoubtedly has a significant knowledge of the subject and a genuine interest in it, it does not appear that he has ever actually worked in the field. Without being an insider, he could only mostly speculate regarding the feelings, views, motivations, and behaviors of the characters.Therefore, while being based on a true story, ""Margin Call"" remains a speculation, albeit a smart and a talented one, and quite possibly fairly true to life. knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",Margin Call

146,faterson,Unexciting High-Quality Drama on Vacuous Financiers' Quest for Unneeded Millions,7,25 June 2012,"Films from the Wall Street (and such) environment are always a twisted type of joy to watch: you observe a bunch of people fretting about something that essentially does not guarantee human happiness at all. Which is to say, money. And so, to use Hitchcock's term, this entire genre of movies could be called, ""McGuffin movies"". They show people hunting for something that is essentially meaningless, that has no value in itself. Therefore, this type of movie is always, in a sense, perverted, in that it focuses on things or ""a thing"" that is not essential in human life. This poses dangers for the film-makers, of course; because how can you make a relevant movie if the characters' focus is on something irrelevant? J. C. Chandor, in his debut movie, manages to avoid these pitfalls skilfully, mainly thanks to the exquisite ensemble acting at his disposal. When you have the grandmasters of the acting profession at your disposal, such as Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci, more than ably assisted by younger actors of the calibre of Zachary Quinto, Paul Bettany, and Simon Baker, this always gives the viewers something to admire on the screen, even if the action of the movie were totally irrelevant. But it isn't; it just won't be exciting enough for many viewers, I suspect. The movie is pretty slow-moving, but never boring; it shows shallow, vulgar people fretting about something that is essentially unimportant (money); and it's difficult to find someone really likable here (Stanley Tucci's character perhaps comes closest, although he, too, is ultimately portrayed as a ""sell-out""). If _Margin Call_ is precise in anything, it's in showing that in an environment where the non-essential is held to be essential, this is what you get: a warped, twisted group of people, with their priorities in life all screwed up. It makes you shudder to think if you had to meet such people on a daily basis in your workplace. At the same time, the movie shows that having your character warped, allowing yourself to become to a degree dysfunctional both emotionally and intellectually, is handsomely rewarded by our society; this is our modern-day royalty, the kings and queens of our era, looking down on us from the skyscrapers high above. Notwithstanding the financial collapse -- because as Jeremy Irons's character says, this is just another stage (although more turbulent than usual) in the never-ending financial cycle with its repetitive, cyclical developments; more or less the same minuscule percentage of people will come out on top in the end, profiting from it all. The irony of this is, of course, in that this doesn't really matter because, as _Margin Call_ convincingly shows, being a millionaire or billionaire is not in any way a safeguard against being miserable in life, and a wretch of a human being.",Margin Call
147,raiderhayseed,A film must evoke some response in a view - this one just alienates you,7,25 March 2012,"If you listen to Alternative Radio, the show put together by David Barsamian in Colorado, USA, everything about this film will be familiar to you. When the characters disclose the income they receive for playing with numbers rather than building bridges, or even digging holes in the ground, it will bring to mind the talk by Richard Wolff (Capitalism Hits the Fan). And that's just the characters who, by their own admission, know anything about anything. The others are just pretty boys (and girls) in expensive clothes who happened to impress the right people at the right time. They are just gamblers who add nothing of substance to the economy. So how do they get away with it? David Korten (author of When Corporations Rule the World and The Great Turning), speaking on Alternative Radio , suggested that the answer lies in the decreasing income received by the American workforce over the last few decades. That means business costs have fallen and profits have risen, so executives in the companies that actually produce something (as well as those that just shift funds around the world) can claim the multi-million dollar salaries because it appears that they the secret to producing huge corporate profits. So the characters in this film are really just overpaid moral, emotional and spiritual dwarfs. They inhabit the same world as the Michael Fassbender character in Steve McQueen's film, HUNGER. Who in the right minds, would want that kind of existence? Hence the film alienates the viewer. No matter how much one of the characters grieves over the death of his dog as he orders his subordinates sell worthless investments to their fellow traders in competing firms, it evokes no sympathy in the viewer. There is no sense of elation at film's end, as a merchant banker firm escapes the fate of the Lehman Brothers. It is all very dour, which works against the dramatic momentum of the film. At least Tony Soprano carries on his squalid and petty crimes against the backdrop of real humans living real lives. The characters in this film are insulated from any real humanity - so they do not invoke any response from real humans. They make Gordon Gecko (WALL STREET) seem almost humaneJohn Kenneth Galbraith, the family friend and confidante of John Kennedy, who might have stopped the Vietnam War had Kennedy survived and listened hard enough, prophesied it all in his book, ""The New Industrial State"".

150,richard-810,Accurate and Gripping Account of the Financial Services Disaster,8,15 February 2013,"This for me is the best film yet made dealing with the workings of Wall Street/City of London type financial institutions and particularly the financial crash of 2008. One thing to stress immediately is please don't imagine that is a worthy, educational type of movie. It is educational (or will be to some people) but there is a real sense of tension and impending doom comparable to the best film noir thrillers. 'Wall Street' 1 and 2 were decent enough films but this has an edge to it that almost feels documentary in tone. The cast are uniformly excellent, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons and Stanley Tucci in particular, to which you can add Kevin Spacey and (always a pleasure to see her these days) Demi Moore. Newcomer to me, Zachary Quinto was particularly good. One thing I must mention; one IMDb reviewer was concerned that those unfamiliar with the financial markets might not understand what is going on. I've worked in financial services for some years myself and I couldn't disagree more. This idea that this business is complicated is all part of the great myth – it's actually very simple. You buy something – a batch of mortgages, gold, shares in a company – you sit on the purchase for ten minutes, a day or (very long term this) a week or two and then you sell. If your risk assessment is right, you sell for more than you paid and congratulations, you've just earned your million dollar bonus! If the assessment was wrong, quickly find some idiot to sell on to and minimise your losses (in which case no bonus but almost certainly 'goodbye old chap, we'll miss you'). It's as simple as that. An excellent and entertaining movie of our times, highly recommended.",Margin Call

Moore, etc.) and made a movie about the fall of Wall Street (an extremely engaging topic) then the movie would be so easy to pull off that it would just write itself. Well, it didn't.

152,MrGoodMovie,Caveat Emptor,7,5 June 2012,"""Margin Call"" follows the events which unfold when the risk specialist (or rather his understudy, after he is summarily marched off the premises) of an investment bank realises that a leveraged collaterised debt product held on their books has gone bad, threatening the very future of the firm.The film exposes the lack of understanding of the inherent risk in leveraged collaterised debt products within senior management, and the flawed nature of the risk models that allowed such products to flourish. Importantly it also shows that the people on the other end of these deals had absolutely no idea what they were actually buying.There is no claim that this movie is based, even remotely, on actual events but one cannot but imagine that this indeed must have been how the whole collaterised debt product debacle started to unravel. However it is quite difficult to conclude from this film that any of the employees or managers actually did anything wrong.The firms' management knew that further heavy losses on the collaterised debt product would bankrupt them. So in one day they sought to ship as many of the tranches as was physically possible, and not buy any more or accept swaps.Sounds like a sensible approach to me. There was a market and there were willing buyers - and if the buyers were silly enough to buy simply on the basis that they were buying at lower prices than they were the day, or the hour, before, then more fool them.As in all walks of life, but especially for those who inhabit the murky world of sophisticated collaterised debt products it is a case of ""Caveat Emptor"". That none of the buyers of the tranches of debt that this firm off-loaded was beware - even as the market price plummeted - says it all really.",Margin Call

Those of us who were close to the events of 2008 will find something personal in the story-telling. Others may see it as more examples of greed and hubris. In any case, the following observations apply to both groups.The performances are top notch. Everyone from Zachary Quinto to Demi Moore brings their A-game. Even supporting characters are oddly fleshed out for a film with such an ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany give the performances of their careers, I think. Only the Jeremy Irons character (John Tuld, aka Dick Fuld) feels a bit over the top, while the rest are truly believable well-rounded depictions.Despite having good characters and amazing cinematography, the film lacks plot. The backdrop and setting are tense, but this doesn't feel like a ""movie"" in the traditional sense. There's no evolution of characters, no arcs, and the ending may leave some wanting. You can compare it to Michael Mann films where plot and pace are unconventional.Not sure how the film will perform commercially, given the material is esoteric. If you're a film buff (and enjoy great performances) or you've been in finance, this is a must-see. Other may likely pass.",Margin Call

But there is a greater threat lurking in the background, and the secret of this will begin to unfold - from the office trading floor to the man at the top in the boardroom.The message is clear -the stock market is about to crash. Traders get twitchy, and the cosy charm of personal wealth is lost in an exchange of crisp dialogue. We are about to learn a lesson in the language of profit and loss: The traders have overstretched themselves, and the promise of high returns won't be fed back to stimulate the market: The public has gone broke........Behind the seemly world of polite manners, smart suits and cocktails, lies a seething energy of ruthlessness: The film is set in the world of trading -and a great story too, that enhances itself to the screen....The film engages energy and invites the viewer to observe a private and exclusive world. But it is like an artificial world born out of science fiction, which will soon crack open to reality: The traders are reminded that they are only one step away from becoming broke themselves ......The film has a subtle way to soft pedal emotions and politeness in a controlled manner - it is like a mafia shake-up without the blood.There are lovely touches to the film - the music score ( by Nathan Larson ) vibrates along pleasantly in pulsation of beat - and there is a snippet of a Chopin prelude ( no.15 in D flat major ) that is cut short in play as Kevin Spacey awakes from slumber as we are about to indulge....and a trader recalled to office from a plush bar, still drinking from a lengthy bottle hidden in a brown, paper bag.

But three are not, that I could see, and would have made for an 11 if they were.First, the great underlying crime and real victims. The crime is what the Countrywide Mortgage Company under Angelo Mozilo was up to, extending mortgages initially at low payments to poorer folks, way too many of them Hispanic or Black, and then jacking up the rates after around 5 years, thus causing giant waves of defaults and foreclosures on millions of homes. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was in this game too. He foreclosed on a 90 year old woman over 27 cents and over 50,000 in total. The toxic sub-prime ""paper"" that resulted (these mortgages bundled with more highly rated mortgages) was the cancerous cause of the situation seen in the film. Merrill Lynch/Bank of America were forced to buy Countrywide as the cost of their being kept alive; Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers (the models for this film) had less luck. Google this 2016 article in the New York Times for more. ""Countrywide Mortgage Devastation Lingers as Ex-Chief Moves On"".Second, it was widely known from 2000 on that the derivatives market was a house of cards. MOZILO HIMSELF SAID SO!! Around 2003. The mentality in the banks was ""So what? We are smart enough to be the first out the door.""The spark that started the race to get out was the property market flattening out around 2006, as seen by a whole lot of quants (who often did warn the deaf ears higher up.)

Chandor does a great job of keeping this relatively boring topic interesting and compelling. Margin Call holds your attention throughout and leaves you wanting more. Chandor was given a crop of actors that many directors only get once in a lifetime. He made the most of it with smart dialog and strong character development. Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Zachary Quinto and Jeremy Irons were all especially good in this film. I look forward to seeing more from J.C. Chandor. It is incredible to me that he wrote and directed this movie as well as All is Lost. We all have the privilege of seeing this director begin what I believe will be a long and fantastic writing and directing career.

This film doesn't rely on overly-theatrical meltdowns and explosive, shouty alpha-male showdowns to have impact, rather it relies on a superb cast, great dialogue and excellent performances by a totally on-form ensemble cast. Stand-out performance from Zachary Quinto who's shock/horror when he realises what's unfolding is a definite watch/rewind/watch moment. Paul Bettany is great as the 'guy who is great at his job, but not quite great enough' as we see in his thouroughly embittered reply 'it happens..... but not to me' line when referring to the senior executives. Simon Baker and Stanley Tucci give their usual excellent performances in.their own inimitable styles, Baker's incomprehension of events superbly demonstrated by him asking the time, muttering ' me', then a few seconds later, asking the time, muttering 'f me'..... etc.
This film proceeds at a modest pace, allowing events to unfold naturally, but the climax, the dramatic 'fire sale' to me highlights why so many hold investment banking in contempt (although this is perfectly balanced by Bettany's 'hypocracy' rant earlier in the film).

An employee finds out the bank is leaking money for the past couple of weeks. After some analysis they figure out the bank is going bust. Everything else is stereotyping. That's all the movie is about. Stereo typing. This is how the movie goes:*** Opening ***Emotionless Assistant Human Resource Manager (Ashley Williams as Heather Burke) orders senior employee to go with her for a talk; Stanley Tucci (as Eric Dale) is being fired in a cold manner by Senior Human Resource Manager Susan Blackwell (as Lauren Bratberg). During the conversation Eric Dale's computer and mobile phone is shut down. A guard to escort the employee out is standing by already. Those cold hearted mean hedge fund corporations! Grrr!!! I think the message was clear.*** The Shocking Discovery ***Protegé of now fired Eric Dale researches the contents from a USB stick which he was given by said fired employee. Protegé finds out the investment bank is going down.*** Personalities ***Enter two more young conscientious employees. Now we have a staff of 3 young employees without a soul because the movie didn't give them any. But to indicate that Protegé is smart we're told he is a rocket scientist, but decided to work for this company because it pays better. So now we've established the discovery is made by a rocket scientist, therefore whatever he says must be true.Enter Kevin Spacey. He has feelings. It has been established because he kinda tries to cry because his dog is dying. So we know Kevin is not a cold-hearted banker (LOL). Some character building here. (Offcourse, we can't have the great mr. Spacey crying in a movie. Are you kidding?)Enter Paul Bettany. His character, Will Emerson, is... well he was in the movie as well.Enter Simon Baker (as Jared Cohen). He's the link (a managing director) between Kevin Spacey and the Grand Admiral of the company. Was given a little bit personality in the movie. So he can push Kevin to do the 'right' thing to cover things up and sell as much of the assets before the company goes bust. Without mentioning that these assets are soon to be worth 0 Dollars.Enter Demi Moore (as Sarah Robertson). She's paid to handle Risk Assessment, but she failed. So she tries to defend herself with a few sentences. During the rest of the movie she was just an object occupying space on the screen. Also, she spoke her lines at a weird, inappropriate moment. The script went horribly wrong here. I felt sorry for her.Enter Jeremy Irons (as John Tuld). He da big man. #1. Grand Admiral. He's cool. That's his role. He realizes the world will be soon plunged in a world of hurt. But he's cool. The mastermind. That's all what he was. Being cool at a big conference table. And being cool at a lunch table.*** Final Scene ***Kevin Spacey, the one with the feelings, is digging a hole to bury his dog in. I suppose it symbolizes Lehman Brothers digging a hole to hide secrets in. Also, Kevin caved in and decided to play along and be immoral for as long as it takes. His team will sell worthless products. Kevin motivated his team to do so. Kevin needs the money. That's why he caved in.To conclude. I give this movie three stars. The movie has no added value. Intellectually it has nothing to offer to anyone. Nor did the movie provide insights into anything. Don't expect to learn anything in this movie. Nor does the movie represent factual events. The three stars are for the actors because they did a decent job - though they weren't tested. Camera work and whatnot is fine. But this is where the good things end.

And because of that, I felt the movie didn't do the best job accurately portray this class of people during the financial crisis.While the movie got it in the ball park with an amoral tone that comes from individuals that work in investment banks... It completely missed the mark on how intensely cautious individuals can be in them. Most people employed at investment banks border on being paranoid when it comes to losing money. and don't even like discussing the possibility. It's well documented that people were fired in this time period for simply making presentations outlining the dangers of Mortgage Backed Securities.Decisions that were made in the course of a couple hours would have been drug out for weeks. I found the fact the events of the movie portrayed were presented over the course of a single evening to be laughable. Something like this would have been kicked around in meetings for weeks, out of paranoia someone was going to make a mistake, and to verify it's veracity before kicking it to the next level of executives. I just kind of assumed this unnamed investment bank represented Lehman Brothers. Because of the timing of events and the fact Jeremy Irons character (John Tuld) seemed like a serious nod to it's CEO Dick Fuld. If that's the case they really missed the mark with Jeremy Irons character's calm demeanor. Fuld was known for many things, but his zen like acceptance at the thought of losing hundreds of millions of dollars was not one of them. Fuld was well known for his ruthless competitiveness and was even nicknamed the ""gorilla or Wall Street"". Something else about the movie that irritated me was the fact that everyone looked as good at the end of the movie as the beginning. These people literally hadn't slept and spent the whole night debating their actions of kicking off a financial crisis. Yet, every tie was pulled up tight... Everyone was wearing the suit coats... Every suit looked fresh... every hair was in place... and about the only person that looked- remotely haggard was Demi Moore. I don't know about anyone else... But I have worked through the night in a suit and by the next day you're a mess.I found it very puzzling that people were potentially losing millions of dollars in annual income, and seemed to understand they were going to start a financial meltdown.... and not one person lost their cool or raised their voice.

172,zaphodb1,Wall Street the Soap Opera,6,3 December 2012,"The film has a star studded cast - Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore and the Zachary Quinto, all of whom deliver fine performances.The film is a fictionalised account of a wall street firm that figures out its risk model is wrong and the firm is massively over exposed to Mortgaged Backed Securities (MBS's), just before the rest of the market finds out they are too. The film explores the ramifications of the management decision to launch a massive liquidation of the firms position on the unsuspecting market, and thus causing the 2008 crash. Part of this is the firms reputational risk, however the film mainly deals with interplay between the staff and whether what the individuals are doing is right. All of this occurs within an environment of current and pending staff layoffs.The film constantly poses the question - is what these guys decide to do morally correct. The film does not answer this question directly nor is the angst of the market towards the company shown or the regulatory response shown.The film does not mention the company involved, however this is clearly Lehman Brothers (the CEO in the film is John Tuld and Lehman's CEO at the time was Richard S Fuld Jr and other similarities). Unfortunately it never happened as depicted in the film. The film tries to create a clean cut crisis and resolution around a 24 hour period.The financial crisis had its origins in US home prices which peaked in late 2006. The first company to get into trouble with sub prime mortgages was Nothern Rock (a UK bank) in September 2007, when it experienced a run on its funds and had to be bailed out. Bear Sterns in July 2007 announced problems with 2 of their hedge funds due to losses in sub-prime mortgages, announced a profit fall of 61% in September 2007 and eventually had to be bailed out/sold in March 2008. Lehman's first encountered problems with its sub prime lender BNC Mortgage in August 2007, closing it and losing $25 million. Lehman's did hold considerable sub prime mortgages on its books when securitising them. It is unclear however, whether this was because they could not sell them or decide to hold them. For the March 2008 quarter, Lehman's profit was $489 million, however by June 2008 a loss of $2.8 billion was reported, due to market volatility reducing its hedges. At this time a management shakeup occurred, sidelining CEO Fuld, although he remained CEO. Ahead of the September quarter results, Korea Development Bank was reported as considering buying Lehman's, however when this was reported as not proceeding Lehman's stock fell 45% and the Dow lost 300 points on 9 September 2008. On September 10 Lehman's announced a $3.9 billion loss for the September quarter. On September 11 Lehman's stock lost another 40%. On September 15, a Monday, Lehman's announced it would file for bankruptcy and the Dow lost 500 points.The Dow which peaked in October 2007, had fallen below 11000 points on September 15. By March 2009, the Dow had fallen to its low of about 6500 points.So its certainly true that Lehman's triggered the Wall street crash of 2008 and the financial crisis that followed. However Lehman's did not cause the crash by bailing out out of sub prime mortgages.So Margin Call is a film exploring the human relationships in a manufactured and simplified financial crisis. Interesting, but it doesn't explore the real issues such as the reasons for the crisis. I would much rather see a film showing what really happened at Lehman's.",Margin Call

It really made me think what I would do if I were in that person's position. In my book, that makes for a worthwhile movie. The casting is excellent: Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey deliver as always; Simon Baker should do more films; Tucci and Moore did well; and the three other guys I've never seen before shined, too.Update: I was intoxicated when I wrote the review.

175,SeussMeTub,Incredible and Riveting in a Very Subtle Way.,10,12 May 2012,"If Oliver Stone's WALL STREET(1987) was the financial masterpiece that illustrated the excesses of the financial world then JC Chandor's smartly written and riveting MARGIN CALL(2011) would be its successor. The entire movie takes place over two days and one sleepless night within an unnamed Wall Street investment firm in a fictionalized retelling of the days just before the 2008 financial meltdown; the film starts with a very subtle bang: a mass firing of employees begins and one of them happens to be the head of the risk department, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci plays him with a smoldering intensity), despite his protests that he is onto something big, they take away his cellphone coverage and he gets escorted out of the building by security. At the last minute he hands over a memory stick to his protégé, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) an MIT graduate in rocket science, with a dire warning. That night, Sullivan manages to piece together a puzzle that may very well be a portent to the firm's financial apocalypse. What follows next is a series of meetings and denouements as to whether the entire company will survive and sacrifice their clients or would they take the risk of keeping their toxic assets and hope to weather the storm.It's an ensemble cast and a very powerful one at that. Quinto's Sullivan is smart and can put the numbers together but he is clearly out of his league on what to do next, since he can no longer reveal what has happened to Tucci (who has been let go and cannot be contacted due to the firm's arrogant incompetence) he then goes to the higher authority, the Brit supervisor Will Emerson (Paul Bettany in one of his best roles in years; Bettany plays Emerson as an amoral realist but with a charm and a coolness that makes him likable). Emerson in turn goes up to his boss, Sam Rogers (the ever reliable Kevin Spacey) and tells him about it; Rogers is the one moral focal point of the entire movie, he for one truly cares about the consequences of saving his own skin, namely he will have to lie to his clients, the very customers who entrusts him with their money, in order to save the company. Spacey plays Rogers as an old, worn down warrior, but still willing to put his morals aside for the sake of practicality- the fact that Spacey also appeared in the preeminent sales movie of the century GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS(1992) makes the impact of his presence more deserving here.As the film moves up in the chain of command the morality, or the lack of it, becomes even more acute as we meet the higher ups: Roger's boss, Jared Cohen (played by Simon Baker in his best role ever) who happens to be younger than him- Cohen is near the top because he's reptilian and is in it for his ego- he's the closest character to a Gordon Gekko in this movie. Baker's counterpart, who happens to be a woman who was responsible for letting Tucci go is Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore, in what also happens to be her best role ever), a hard as stone corporate boss who just happens to be in over her head. But the man on top, an emaciated vulture named after the true to life last CEO of the now defunct Lehman Brothers is John Tuld (Jeremy Irons). Irons plays Tuld as a man who makes few but important decisions and will stop at nothing to make sure that the firm makes money, regardless of who gets thrown under.JC Chandor makes excellent use of pacing and suspense and despite on what appears to be a complex storyline set in the world of international finance, is able to make it clear that any layman can understand what is going on and what the consequences will be. There's an ongoing joke within the movie that as the problem gets passed to the higher ups, the less they themselves seem to understand what is going on and consequently, asks that their subordinates explain it to them as if they would explain it to a child or a dog. While this movie may not be to everyone's taste, I would highly recommend it to anybody that wants to know just what exactly happens when one decides to use a bank or another financial institution in Wall Street: you may never trust a financial firm ever again after seeing this.",Margin Call
176,torchwood949-166-552404,A Fascinating Depiction,9,11 March 2012,"From first time director J.C Chandor is 'Margin Call', a financial drama that takes place within the first 24 hours of a crisis within a large investment bank and shows the actions and motives of the players involved within this financial collapse. After a liquidation of a large portion of the companies staff a young risk analysts discovers a document left behind by an ex-member of staff which projects a large financial loss. From the on forward we see the chain of events that followed throughout the company to prevent this from happening.On paper 'Margin Call' sounds quite bland but actually proves to be a dense and intense drama, holding the audiences attention throughout, despite the fact the film mainly takes place within a work place. It shows the lengths people will go to just to protect themselves without caring how their actions affect others. Jeremy Irons plays 'the big cheese' of the company and asks his employee's to talk to him as if he was 'a dog' and through this manages to keep the audience aware of what's happening who may not be familiar with the stock market. The script works as strongly as though Aaron Sorkin, who wrote 'The Social Network' and 'Moneyball', wrote it. In comparison it ranks quite proudly next to those films which both managed to bring subjects that weren't interesting to many people but still managed to bring in mainstream audiences. It's a shame this hasn't had the same marketing as I feel it could have reached that same level if given the chance.However if there's anything critical to say about this film it's that it feels like a televisual drama rather than a cinematic experience. Where as 'The Social Network' was directed by David Fincher, a director with a clear style managing to create a film generally about people sitting around in rooms beautiful and captivating, Chandor hasn't quite grasped that niche yet and falls short on creating an experience that needs to be seen on a big screen. That being said it provided a story that I knew nothing about and more importantly, cared nothing for and managed to create a brilliant look at a financial crisis while giving it real human character which drove the story forward and was more about the consequences of actions than the impending doom that was looming over them all.",Margin Call
177,orshansj,Critics' reviews,5,18 July 2020,"It was the very first thing I noticed, great reviews from critics. I am pretty sure that not a single one of those critics understood what really went on here, but it seems to me that these days it is really popular to hate people who make a lot of money in finance. They are all evil.As someone who actually knows what went on in 2001 and 2008, I can tell you a thing or two about some flaws in this movie. They were very obvious flaws but a regular guy would never catch on to them.First, a lowly analyst who comes out with a broken model would NEVER EVER EVER EVER trigger such a massive sale of assets.Second, Kevin Spacey said, ""No swaps"". Why not? Swaps are insurance. Why not insure your asset rather than sell them for 65 cents on the dollar? Oh, yeah, I know. The mysterious man from England ordered to liquidate. He must know something. Well, guess what. I know something too. This was like taking your car with blown engine to a junk yard instead of having your insurance company fix it.Third, all the traders in that firm could have just walked away. Quit on the spot and kept their reputations. 1.4 million bonus is a joke. 2.7 million bonus is a joke. These are traders and most of them were young people. They work in Fixed Income. They trade billions worth of bonds. They make $250K base salary plus performance bonus that could be 3-4 times the size of their salary. If they walked away, they would have been hired somewhere else and make this money in just a few years. 20 times that money during their careers. In the movie, they destroyed their careers, walked away with 1.2-1.3 million after taes and become ... what ... plumbers, car mechanics, nurses?The characters in this movie were very authentic. The lingo was very real. The acting was good. That's the only reason why I gave it 5 stars. But the story was so anti-Wall Street, so simplified and skewed, made specifically to have people who ""don't know"" recoil in disgust.Someone once told me, ""Everyone hates a lawyer until they need one"". The same thing is true about Wall Street. Except, there is no such thing as Wall Street. There is ""Finance"" and we are all mixed up with it up to our eyebrows. We get car loans and business loans and mortgages from banks and lenders. We buy annuities from insurance companies. We want our money to grow and we blame banks for paying low rates without actually understanding why they are paying low rates.This movie was ok. Just ok.",Margin Call

The acting is pulled off brilliantly and does match the sense of urgency that the film is portrayed in (24hours). The basic story tells us how a banking firm has realised that its assets have become toxic and they literally have to dump these assets which will trigger a sequence of events which in reality have already happened to lead to an economical meltdown. The film doesn't give us much reason to how or why it happened but an insight into how human nature shines through in this film. We are constantly reminded how cold and selfish we can all be, even Sam (Spacey) who knows the consequences of the actions of the firm continues to work towards the impending disaster. One thing i did notice was how Emerson (Bettany)has some weird American accent going on, which either appears or starts to sound like a British American accent. I am not sure what was trying to be achieved but this really did annoy me throughout the film! Also i found that there was a lot going on and the plot does bounce around from time to time which made it hard for me to concentrate on the film. Positives: decent acting and big names in the film Negatives: Too much going on and plot bounces around Overall: its not a bad film but don't be expecting an edge of the seat thriller film even though it does have some tense points in the film.",Margin Call

The plot was tightly knit, movie's well directed and acted by a pretty star-studded cast I must say.Without going into details I just want to say it's definitely worth a watch. I feel it is somewhat lack in character development in some key characters - the movie could have been a bit longer to accommodate that - and the ending was somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying.

Particularly good at conveying the thinking of those who get sucked into the business and wind up detached from the real world with no understanding that their only business is to create fake ""profits"". Great touches abound. Young kids get to ride around in chauffeur-driven cars which are available 24 hours a day; not one scene in which any of the leads interacts with a ""real"" person (they live in their own world and don't know, care or understand what anyone else thinks--yet deem themselves superior because of how much money they make compared to the little people). Contains the best-written scene of the year: Stanley Tucci describes how he used to be an engineer and quantifies what his building of one bridge meant to two small cities connected by the bridge. This scene sums up the point-counterpoint of the movie: those that add real value to society by creating something useful as opposed to those who simply create money (and almost always as a result of others losing theirs). Would-be writers should study this scene and then hope they will ever write one as good. Big strenght of the movie is that it isn't preachy and we see that the seduction of the life-style is simply too hard to resist even for people who otherwise seem decent, articulate and well-educated.

What this movie brings to the table is the moral dilemma faced by the first companies to recognize the dire situation they had, and would put the world, in. I think this was a very valuable addition to the media covering the beginnings of the crisis.In reality, a few divisions of a few financial institutions had an idea of what was coming, lost billions and they were fined in the hundreds of millions. But no one could have predicted an entire collapse. Anyway... solid movie!",Margin Call
183,daddyofduke,Greed Isn't Just Good. It's Essential,7,26 February 2012,"The tag line for Margin Call,, spoken in the film by John Tuld, the CEO of a prominent, unnamed investment company, is, ""Be first, be smarter, or cheat."" The film is neither first nor smarter, but it definitely doesn't cheat.A margin call occurs when an investor has purchased stock on credit, and the value of that stock has declined below the minimum level allowable. The investor has to put up more money to cover the loss, and if he/she doesn't, then stock in the investor's account will be sold. In other words, a margin call is a very bad thing. And what is happening at the financial company is extremely bad.Because of its huge leveraging of mortgage back securities that precipitated our painfully real financial crisis, the firm in the film is facing losses that exceed its market capitalization. Another very bad thing. The film focuses on the personal and professional impact of the CEO's decision to sell its inventory of those securities to its usual customers, knowing that as soon as the purchases are completed the stocks they just sold will be worthless. But the firm will probably survive, even if the customers it sold the securities to don't. The performances given are chillingly true. Jeremy Irons plays the CEO who is as amoral as he is brilliant. Kevin Spacey, in his usual Academy Award winning style, is the tortured head of the trading department that will sell the securities. The analyst who discovers that the firm could fail within 24 hours is played with subtle excellence by Stanley Tucci. Zachary Quinto is the analyst who brings the situation to everyone's attention when Tucci's character is fired. Indeed, the entire cast is excellent and includes Simon Baker, Paul Bettany, Demi Moore, and Mary McDonnell whose contribution is, sadly, exactly one scene. My guess is that the Demi Moore character is at least partly based on Erin Callan, the momentarily high profile chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers who was fired immediately preceding the legendary firm's collapse.Margin call is not the first film to focus on Wall Street's failures. One of the first films on the subject was the excellent documentary ""Inside Job"", narrated by Matt Damon. ""Too Big to Fail"", the HBO film starring William Hurt and Paul Giamatti, more effectively captured the intensity of the events. And maybe the best film of the lot actually preceded The Great Recession. ""Wall Street"" which starred Michael Douglas and Mr. Hedonist himself, Charlie Sheen, warned us there were those out there who were driven by their affirmation that ""greed is good"". But Margin Call definitely doesn't cheat us in the acting performances it offers.At one point in the film Paul Bettany's character explains what he did with the two and a half million dollars he made the previous year. Although no charitable organization benefited from his pay, some, shall we say, professional women certainly did. And it is that very amoral insensitivity to the public's good that got us into trouble in which we are now mired.",Margin Call

Right from the very offing, you realise you're in for a surreal ride just by how gripping the movie is. You never, for a second, want to take your eye off this one.Once it has been brought to the attention of the Executive Committee that the company is about to enter deep waters, things get real, real quick and real fast. With no regard for ethics and morals, the company needs to decide how to stay afloat and do not give a second thought to the consequences of the employees or how badly it will affect the stock market.
The sheer audacity while making this decision is something that will blow your mind. The class and panache these higher order white collar executives show is something that has been portayed beautifully.

186,jens-wegar,Surprisingly slow for a thriller,6,6 January 2012,"I realize this movie is supposed to depict the real build up to the financial crisis of 2008, but somehow it failed to be both a mockumentary or a real thriller in my eyes. At no point was I at the edge of my seat so to speak, wondering what will happen next. The film in my opinion also failed to properly explain why there actually was a problem in the company, other than basically saying that they had made risky investments which might collapse the company. But what was it in the formula that the risk management guys had discovered errors in, which caused such an alarm? The characters just point at some screens which we never properly see, just saying ""look at this"" and ""oh my god"". What was it that they saw on those screens? The film left me with a feeling of there being unfinished business, things which should have been cleared or better explained within the scope of the film.With such an A-star cast I could not miss the movie, and I can't really complain about their performances. They probably did the best with what they had been given. The large number of A-stars might actually have been part of why the film never properly took off, since everybody needed to get their screen time. I wish Stanley Tucci would have gotten more screen time than the empty offices in the middle of the night though. His was the only character in which I felt invested and although we do get to see what happens to him in a way, I still feel there could have been more to his story. Kevin Spacey did a fine job of being a boss torn between what the right choices are when the choices all are more or less bad ones. Demi Moore's was a character which I felt was somewhat unnecessary. Her faith did not move me in any way and that's probably because she didn't get enough screen time for me to really be interested in what happens to her. Like I said, probably in the end the movie had too many important characters to allow any one of them to properly become really important to me as the viewer. Watch the film to get a glimpse of corporate management structures, their behavior and how they might react in a crisis, but don't watch it expecting to get a good explanation of why all of a sudden loads of banks needed bail outs in 2008.",Margin Call
187,sayloroct,"A Story About Personal, Not Financial crisis",8,12 August 2013,"Margin call has a great cast and tells a compelling story with an oddly cold and chilling mood, as stories set in office buildings at night often do. The story is set during the financial meltdown of 2008, and they throw around financial terms like ""MBS"", ""VAR"" and ""swaps"", without explaining them to the audience. But never mind because the financial events are only a backdrop for the real story: people trying to cope with their world turned upside down, the choices that they must make and the consequences they must accept. There is no need for the audience to be concerned with mortgage backed securities, value at risk or credit default swaps.All the audience need know is that a quant at an unnamed investment bank (probably modeled after Goldman Sachs) looks at financial data passed to him from a fired risk manager (Stanley Tucci) and discovers that the market is about to tank. His firm is sitting on potential losses greater than the value of the company. What to do? The choice is stark: go bankrupt or survive by selling the toxic securities as fast as possible to clients who haven't yet caught on and live with the consequences - they will be lepers in the financial world.Many reviewers have projected their own preconceived opinions about Wall Street on to this film and have not really paid close attention. This movie happens on Wall Street but it isn't ""Wall Street"", and it isn't about greed, villainy or blame. While greed paid a major role in creating the financial crisis, this movie has nothing to go with Wall Street greed. Instead, the movie is about survival and its costs. The only mention of greed occurs when Will Emerson explains the root of crisis is the greed of all those people so borrowed mortgage money they could never pay back so that they could live beyond their means.One of the most impressive aspects of the movie is that there are no villains. It would have been easy to turn characters like the self-centered Seth Bregan (Penn Badgley), the slick Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), the cold (Sarah Robertson) and the superficial Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) into villains, but the movies does not. These are all reasonable people acting in reasonable ways given the crisis they face. There is no underhanded maneuvering, no lying and no backstabbing. At several points characters ask whether they are going to be fired and every time they are told the truth. The salesmen are told in no uncertain terms that their careers will be in tatters when they dump the toxic asests. No lies. No sugar coating. Just the straight facts. The easiest target would have been the head of the firm John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), but he is no Gordon Gekko. He is not a conman, double-dealer or venal. He is just pragmatic. At one point, he clearly states his philosophy: the only 3 ways to succeed are to be smarter, to be first or to cheat. He says he won't cheat, and every bank has smart people so he is going to be first - the first to dump these securities. To him, what he is doing is nothing new. Market crashes have a long history as he shows y reeling of the dates of the many previous ones in many countries over many centuries. Human nature is what it is.Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) is the only character is might be seen as sympathetic. He has real qualms about what they are doing, although he is a lot more broken up about his sick dog. This does not keep him from going along with the plan and even giving rousing speeches to his traders, however. And it doesn't keep him from changing his mind about quitting because he needs the money. Just like everyone else in the film. He is the only hypocrite in the group.",Margin Call

Everyone takes everything very cool, as it they are just executing on some personal contingency plan which they have already developed.Second, the description of what is happening is quite pathetic. Obviously it has to be dumbed down for a film, but, please, at least try to make it believable for somebody who knows a bit. Note to writer of screen play. Lewis's book ""The Big Short"" managed to write intelligently and clearly. Third, everything is psychological.

During the scenes when the characters were dealing with the stress in their own way, I just didn't feel it with them.Some of the symbolism was very good. The dog represented the dying real estate market; watch where it ends up. The Seth character represents the everyman. Pulled in from his evening revelry he is forced to deal with this reality, and he never gets over how much money his superiors make. Sam represents the old guard career trader who is able to overcome his moral questions and put on a good front for his staff. This is the source of the heartless Wall Streeters. They are compelled to put profit over collateral damage.There are a lot of great digs at the overpaid Wall Streeters.

In the movie's defense, it's entertainment not a documentary, so I gave it a 6.

Other than that I have to say I don't understand the positive reviews. It is, frankly, boring. It's not a ""thriller"" as there isn't one single thrilling moment. Most of the characters are a bit ridiculous and there's so many of them vying for position on the screen it's hard to know who you're supposed to be rooting for: Zachary Quinto? Stanley Tucci? Kevin Spacey? Spacey's fake tan is unintentionally hilarious. Also I don't think morally centered characters suit him. He's always cast as a bad guy these days and it suits him better.The non-existent plot is repeated over and over: analyst discovers model was incorrect and predicts impending doom for the Nameless Bank. Calls his boss and explains it. His boss calls HIS boss and explains it. His boss calls HIS BOSS and so on and so forth. Helicpoters fly in with execs on board. Eventually they decide what they're going to do and they do it. They're afraid that Stanley Tucci will go rogue but they talk to him and he's fine. Nothing really happens. There's no tension.Perhaps the most laughable character is Seth, the 23 year old junior analyst who for the entire movie doesn't seem to give a crap about this job or the Nameless Bank as a whole - he spends most of the first few hours drinking for crying out loud. Then when he realises he's going to probably lose his job we find him crying in a toilet cubicle and saying this is all he ever wanted to do. Really??

One of the most powerful moments comes when one of the characters justifies the impending carnage on the ground that the about-to-be-victimized masses deserve no pity because they have been happy to gorge themselves at the trough that is about to be overturned.The film delivers a powerful situation and argument in a low-key style which, to its credit, determinedly eschews melodrama. I have two major reservations about the screenplay, however. First, for my taste the drama is spelled out too much in the dialogue rather than being felt between the lines. As a result, despite the best efforts of a stellar cast, the characters remained two-dimensional and ultimately left me cold.

196,the_wrinkled_mind,Engrossing fare.,8,13 November 2011,"The triumph of a good story, talking about a real event, is when it succeeds in not being judgmental about the story.Instead it allows the viewer to draw out conclusions about the event or the people involved in it.In the case of Margin Call, Writer/Director J.C. Chandor gives us a peek into the last few hours of an investment firm, without overly forcing himself to portray them as outright villains.In some ways this is an unconventional thriller, dealing with human characters.How they react to situations and problems, may it be ethical, social, moral etc.In that sense it reminds you of '12 Angry Men' or 'Frost/Nixon'.Its also a wonderful insight in what really went on during those last few hours, before this world so unknowingly drowned into a financial meltdown.The night before the storm rushed in.Characters are well defined in this movie and are its biggest assets.May it be the weary-seen-it-all Sam Rogers(brilliant played by Kevin Spacey), practical Will Emerson(Bettany), bullish Tuld(Irons), ambitious but insecure Seth(Badgley), shamelessly driven Cohen(Baker), helpless, sacked Dale(Tucci), confused nerd Peter(Zachary Quinto) who begins to accept the ruthlessness of corporate life or the lamb to be sent to the butcher's Sarah(Demi Moore).The only shortcomings of this film is that it might not be for everyone.This is a forceful drama in its own little sedate way and that might not be everyone's cup of tea.

Baker was pretty good, Quinto and the rest of the cast were uninteresting.What makes a film for me is when the dialog, director, actors, etc make me CARE about the characters, in this film I couldn't say I cared about anyone. Calling this a THRILLER is a WILD EXAGGERATION. If you fell asleep half way through and woke up at the lat 10 minutes you wouldn't miss a thing.Again, what makes a film for me is when I CARE about the characters, in this film I couldn't say I cared about anyone, well maybe Demi, since she was getting fired for the mistakes of those above her.",Margin Call
198,mgorman-6,Quietly gripping morality tale - a near perfect movie,10,23 October 2011,"Saw this last night. Set at a Wall Street firm on the night in 2008 when the leaders realize that changes in the market will wipe them out if they don't immediately stop selling the products that have been making them all rich, the movie centers on the moral dilemma - recognized by some characters but dismissed by others - that they face in unwinding their positions, saving themselves but shifting the pain to others.The movie finds a way to hold the mirror up to our civilization, showing how we are all complicit in a collective 'dream' (one character says at one point, in response to another who says he feels like he is in a 'dream', 'Funny, it seems like I just woke up'). The dream is the illusion of easy, risk-managed wealth that the financial markets manufacture, again and again, since the emergence of capital markets 200 years ago, until the illusion morphs overnight into a panic. Reality intervenes, fear takes over, and the 'survivor' is the guy who first reaches the lifeboat. So there are no villains in this movie, just people, richly drawn, beautifully acted characters realized by some of our best actors who relish the opportunity to show what they can do given a killer script and enough screen time between lines to actually be the people they are portraying. Central to the movie's success: 1) It gets across the essence of what is going on in the financial markets without bogging us down or dumbing it down2) finding a moral question that can be resolved in a night, yet which is nevertheless a perfect allegory for the whole set of moral questions raised by an economy that works the way ours does, rewarding false confidence, recklessness, and deceit as often as industry, skill, and integrity3) the placement of young, innocent but perceptive characters at the center of the drama, who function as our eyes and ears, who are like stand-ins for all of us who weren't there, at the heart of the dream machine, when the latest fantasy of easy wealth was exposed as a collective delusion4) really 'gets' the trader ethos and manner - they are a kind of warrior caste, foul-mouthed, impulsive, deeply selfish, surviving by their ability to outplay their counterparts, and yet living by a warrior code that sets boundaries on what they will and will not do to one another (having spent three years on Wall Street several panics ago, it rang as true as any movie I have seen on the subject)It's like Mamet, except you don't have to work as hard to figure out what everyone's up to. It's like Chinatown, except the 'crime' is something far worse than molesting a single young girl. These guys f****d the entire planet, for Ch*****sake. It's like the best movie I've seen in a little while.What an incredibly sure hand from a director on his maiden voyage! Who is this guy? Whoever you are, please don't stop. I would pay a lot to see what he could do with topics like 'the decision to go to war', or 'the emergence of China/India/Brazil/Indonesia from poverty to global player'. Hell I would go see him revive Mother Goose, after this debut.I'll calm down now. Enjoy.",Margin Call
199,StaticEngine,"Cold, calculating, the real Wall Street",9,23 October 2011,"Watching this movie was like sitting in a meeting with VCs, Investors, and C-Level executives. I've been through a few of those meetings, and I easily recognize the personalities. They're not exactly likable, animated, nor warm, but they are singularly focused on one thing: making money.And so goes the tale of an unnamed financial brokerage that, thanks to the analysis of a young trader played by ""Star Trek"" and ""Heroes"" star Zachary Quinto, realizes that the Mortgage Backed Securities that it is holding has placed it in a precarious position that is close to, if not already, underwater. The storm unravels in a single 24 hour-plus period, and the outcome, well, we can just look at the real world markets to see the outcome.What's really fascinating to watch here is the interests and motivations of the individuals, because as much as this is a character piece, it's also an essay on the pitfalls of short term motivation. People who know too much are paid a million dollars to sit quietly in a room for a day and not talk. Traders are offered a bonus of $1.4M to meet a personal quota to sell assets they know are junk, with an additional $1.3M per person if the whole floor hits quota. An executive loses 60% of his team, and cries because his dog is dying, yet never thinks to call his son (also implied to be in finance) to share the news of the pending crash. Execs view what they're doing as the inevitable ebb and flow of the tide, waxing about the constant distribution of wealthy and poor, how the numbers will never change, and how the fallout is ultimately yet another opportunity to buy low soon and sell high later.And that's just it. Separated from the world (barely a single character unrelated to the firm has any screen time or speaking role), focused on their personal short term gains (one broker obsesses over the annual salaries of his superiors), and trapped in a situation where everyone is convinced that they ""need the money"", selfish people act in their own self interest.Margin Call plays like a documentary. The world is ruined, but the folks behind it take care of each other, even when they're offering up a sacrificial lamb. It's never personal, it's just business, and despite the turmoil you can imagine that the same people will be in the same room making the same calls a decade from now, leading us down the same path and shrugging it off as just the way things are.",Margin Call

201,totally-bogus,Tremendous ensemble cast,10,28 February 2021,"I spent nearly four decades in the Investments field. That was what brought me to this film, but what makes me rave about it is the acting. I love films where there is a strong ensemble cast working together, where every character, no matter the size of their role, is well acted. Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, Penn Badgley, Susan Blackwell and Ashley Williams all give excellent performances.I also love the realism and the balance in the script. Far too many films about the great financial crisis of that time approach it in a very cartoonish manner, with cardboard cutout characters and a poor understanding of what the world of finance is all about. In fact, this film goes as far as to have one character engage in the kind of cartoonish rant we've all become used to, followed by another character saying, ""You do know it's a little more complicated than that, right?"". It also includes a superb short speech by another character about ""normal people"" who ""really want what we have to give to them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from"", and ""I take my hand off (the scales) and the whole world gets really ____ing fair, really ____ing quickly and nobody actually wants that.""On the opposite side of the ledger, multiple characters home in on the cold reality that rule number one is, don't lose money. If it's necessary for someone else to lose in order for you to win, that's just the way this particular world works. It becomes more evident when you watch the film a second or third time, as it becomes apparent that several key players have known the risks and known the inevitable outcome of the house of cards they have built for some time, but continued to ride the wave of mega profits for as long as they could before cashing out. The characters are presented so well that I recognized them and felt like I could attach names to them, of people I have known in my career.All in all, this is an excellent inside look at the people at the heart of the great financial crisis.",Margin Call
202,PanTonowicZ,Moral and psychological insight into people behind financial crisies and their actions,8,26 November 2011,"Most of us know financial crisis form the external point of view, from watching CNN and listening about derivatives, swaps often understanding from it as much as from black magic... Therefore bankers, stock traders and the rest of wall street's white collars are thought to be some kind of pure evil ruling the world. For me it's very medieval like train of thoughts. None of the less looking at this whole crisis from the inside must have been completely different experience don't you agree. Thats about what this film is.Real people made of flash and blood who just like we have so much to lose. About psychological state, morality motives of people who suddenly found themselves in situation no one want to be in making hard choices.Director J.C. Chandor did great job especially considering its his first featured film. He doesn't simplify and manage to tell about all these financial nuances without making viewers fall asleep. He even built tension that stays till the end. Shows how hard decisions has to be made over one night and how not guilty is being blamed just because someone has to be. Clash of generations can be observed just next to considerations about what's right or wrong and how it contradicts with interest of the ""firm"". And what i found very well done is long range of genuine charterers. Acting is great especially Jermey Irons and Kevin Spacey they always deliver great performance. Stanley, Demi and Paul are also very solid. Even Mr Mentalist (Simon Baker) and Zachary Quinto (recently geyed-up :P) don't disappoint I ll even say that as little as we can watch Baker he creates enigmatic character. I strongly recommend it to all who think that Wall Street is a capitol of evil, to those who like WallStreet or Money never Sleeps, to those who want some other perspective on crisis and to all who like to watch great film after long day.

From what I understood, the creators explicitly wanted to fictionalize the crisis of Lehmann Brothers without going into the technical details (this can be inferred when multiple people request an explanation in ""English""), which is still impossible because of the time constraint. They instead focussed on portraying how the hierarchy of the bureaucracy responds to such a crisis and the human emotions they reflect onto such circumstances. But, in my opinion it fails to deliver that impact. The music is almost absent and dialogues are okayish. As far as acting is concerned, the ensemble cast is what motivated me to watch the film, but the directors and writers failed to utilise such a potent and talented cast.

216,LongMane,A Good Veterinarian Could Save that Animal!,6,19 October 2013,"Chandor has spun up an incredibly (if sadly) believable series of scenes. The very final scene pisses away all plausibility in a few seconds of runtime. I will not spoil the end here, except to say that an incredible coincidence comes out of nowhere. Chandor clearly intends to make a poignant metaphor. Instead, it hits like a freshman short story writer with a baseball bat.The remainder of the film is understated and tense. The first third could be called lagging. Someone has advised not to allow the slightest hint of financial explanation. The scenes in which the predicament is discussed by a growing number of executives feel false. There is some throwaway trader jargon intended to provide authenticity without boring people who do not follow markets. When CEO character finally appears, his job is to play Doctor Watson. ""Explain it to me as if I was a small child or a golden retriever."" Really? The CEO would deliver that stock line? The function could not have been performed by any number of junior traders that crowd the movie?The Brooklyn Bridge crossing scene is the opposite. It reads authentically, carried by Paul Bettany.All told, the movie held my attention. It avoided the excesses of 1987's Wall Street (The Gordon Gecko echo). It steered clear of the nonstop foul language and scenery-chewing of Glengarry Glen Ross. I wanted it to be great. Maybe there will be a director's cut? Who knows?

It was almost like hearing sentences without subjects or action verbs. And very little was revealed about the actual nature of the financial crisis other than their formulas were broken. I wanted more.The ending was weak to say the least. It just ended with the Spacey character burying his dead dog in his ex-wife's yard while she tells him that he doesn't live there anymore.

The acting is splendid. The technical aspects of the stock market are underplayed and not complicated but the power of the firm and its leaders clearly is evident. This is a history lesson wrapped in the professional acting skills of people who lived this period. There are some obvious (and mentioned in other reviews) technical glitches about 'site security' and so forth but what is not present (and not missed) in any menace as so often alluded to in other films depicting businesses and the markets.What is so well exampled was an underlying coldness that enveloped each interaction. So many times you would wait for the word of kindness, not politeness but kindness, and it never came. The voice of reassurance, not direction but affirmation of one for all and all for one, but it never came. I sense that this movie did something unlike other movies, it clearly showed a business without mercy, compassion if you will or love. But respectful politeness only. And it did such with a clarity that impressed and, in a way, worried.

It shows how a risk analyst figured out how high leverage had exposed the company to greater risk. We can see what happens when the first companies had figured their risk. The aggressive trading is insightful as it shows the amount of money they are willing to loose on every trade due to high risk.

The drive to the movie store to rent this ""movie"" was more thrilling to be honest...it was all downhill from there. It must be a typo, but even in the movie's plot summary it states ""a thriller that revolves around..."" it doesn't revolve, it fails, it's a movie that focuses on a bank's corporate workings.I've also read a few reviews, but only after watching the film, just to see if I was the only person having an issue with this film.

Yes is does, if you don't believe me, read more reviews.From the beginning, I wasn't sure who the protagonist or the antagonist was, maybe that's the point(?). To me, it seems to focus around the antagonists, the protagonists, are people who rent movies for enjoyment, who allow the banks to control their lives without question.

222,linaskk,Review of Margin Call,7,18 December 2011,"Some people might say that 2 Academy Awards winner Kevin Spacey has lost his prime spark and since performances in American Beauty or K-PAX (back in 1999 and 2001, accordingly) have not done anything worth mentioning. Yes, he starred many great movies at his golden age, 90s: The Usual Suspects, L.A. Confidential or Se7en, to mention a few, but last decade was pretty shallow for him. Seems like Spacey is back in 2011, J.C. Chandor's financial thriller Margin Call. Together with Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto and Demi Moore they try to save huge company from facing financial crisis in 24 hours.Margin call starts as a reflection of recent nowadays world's events - huge company suffers from staff redundancy and even the most loyal employees are told to leave their jobs. (At this point you might get a little déjà vu from Up In The Air, but similarities of these two ends just around the corner). On his way out, one of the staff managers Eric Dale entrusts secret unfinished project to junior worker Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), whispering ""Be careful"" to his ear. Young and ambitious genius Peter decides to finish his ex-foreman's mysterious work and finds out that their company is doomed to bankrupt and lose all their capital in very near future. So, the staff has time till morning to figure out what to do. Here rises the moral aspect, what will company chose – sell their stocks, giving away all the problems in package, or just give up fairly.The cast of Margin Call truly deserves many good words. Amazingly colorful, experienced and talented male actor set like this could have saved almost any lame plot from evolving into disaster movie (capitals or not, doesn't really matter), luckily, they did not have to. Well known movie stars: already mentioned Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Stanley Tucci, Paul Bettany etc., trusted young and unknown director J.C. Chandor on his first journey to the big screen and we here have surprisingly good result. It would be difficult to divide roles to leading and supporting ones, despite their position in company's hierarchy, there are 4 or 5 people getting pretty much the same amount of time in the script and successfully using it.Technical details of crisis were not escalated here, more likely covered, by a few meaningless dialogues like: ""-Do you know what it means? -Yes, but what do you think about it? -The same as you do."". It is understandable that many people do not care about the financial details, but throwing a lot of hardly understandable economical terms at the watcher would seem like way more serious choice than simply wrapping everything in the paper in such a simple way.Combination of great actors not necessarily grants success to a movie, the Expendables must have been a good lesson proving that. Margin Call has much more: subtle, but well used cinematography, strong dialogue lines, pretty unique plot and thriller's atmosphere, which enables movie about a thing like finances not to appear boring on screen.",Margin Call

I can not believe the only thing it was nominated for was best screenplay, it should have been nominated for Best Picture as well, and also it should have had a number of acting nominations, e.g. Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto all easily could have been nominated for best actor, and others in the movie should have got supporting nominations. Perhaps that was the problem a lot of actors who all had a fair bit of screen time, no one actor completely carrying the movie, but to me that show's it was a fine movie because no one actor completely dominated, they all carried the movie with equal weight.To have not been nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and to have not been nominated in any of the acting awards is a huge travesty.It should have without a doubt won Best Screenplay. I saw ""Midnight in Paris"" (the screenplay winner) and thought it was hugely overrated, though admittedly the friend I went with liked it. Still I think even she didn't think it was one of Woody Allen's greatest. In ""Midnight in Paris"" Rachel McAdams (who I normally love as an actress) played a 1 dimensional caricature. Not her fault, but the fault of the script. How many movies have you seen where someone has an absolutely appalling girl/boyfriend and it's screamingly obvious to the audience that they shouldn't be with them but we need to go through to the predictable end when the lead finally realises that hysterical screeching greedy selfish girlfriend is surprise surprise not right for him! To me that is not in anyway a particularly ""Best Screenplay""! By the way sorry for the Midnight in Paris spoiler, but trust me you can tell in the first 2 minutes that she will not be the one the lead ends up with.Anyway back to ""Margin Call"". I actually understood it (well most of it!, which stunned me as it was about financial markets, and I'm no finance expert. At the same time the film was complex enough for it not to seem that it had been dumbed down. It was also quite suspenseful and riveting, the minute it started I had my full concentration on it, and did not lose concentration. Quite a task really for a screen writer who is writing about such a dry topic and no murders or car chases to spice it all up! So all in all I am appalled that this movie was so ignored at the Oscars, a great miscarriage of justice if you ask me! I would rarely give a 10 out of 10 so the fact that I have scored this movie so high gives you an indication of what a travesty it is that this movie was so ignored by the academy. (BTW IMDb thanks for the spelling correction but realises is and was actually the correct spelling before you yanks decided to butcher the English language! Just joking! To my wonderful American friends I admit you did improve some of the spellings, for instance jail makes more sense than our version gaol! Okay now I am sounding like a pompous fool I know!)",Margin Call

Its not just a story of a probable scenario that kicked off the mortgage crisis, its also the story of why investment banking isn't for everyone.

Inevitably if you are driving a career with your foot fully pressed on the throttle, crisis is inevitable.

This movie depicts the environment and the people so perfectly and added food for thought as well if you are willing to think about it deeply. For example, the analyst could have been a rocket scientist and built something useful. Eric Dale did build a really useful bridge. Sam Rogers summed it up beautifully when in his final conversation with the CEO replied that if he was digging trenches that he would at least have the holes in the ground to show for his effort. Instead of doing useful things, these people are here simply because the pay is good. Unlike most other professions where you enter to do some good for society (medical so you can heal people, teaching so you can guide the future generation, manufacturing so you can make things that people use, entertainment so you amuse people etc), investment banking attracts people that want to make money for themselves.

Yeah one needs money to live in the current society, but a company with employees getting up to $2.5 million a year is not needed and really doesn't deserve anyone's pity.Not surprisingly the head of the company is greedy and does immoral steps to secure few peoples' butts. People tend to be like that, get all possessive about millions of dollars. As human beings we should all be far above all that.A movie about people not getting by because of a lack of ability to make enough money to live decent lives, now that's an actual subject that should raise interest.

Instead I learn that this is the work of a little known writer/director who, in my opinion, has made a great film on an amazingly low budget of just $3.4 million. Well done to writer/director J.C. Chandor, the attraction of so many talented and big name actors to this film is testament to how well written the screenplay was.Overall, this film has beautifully developed characters who were very well written and portrayed outstandingly by an excellent cast. The strength of this film lies in character development that was so well considered it paved the way for a thoroughly enjoyable storyline that lets the audience focus on the key characters who are staring at numbers that point to a serious problem not just for their company, but the entire banking system.SPOILER: I loved the simplicity of the story told over a 48 hour time line involving a handful of key decision makers at a major (unnamed) investment bank. In essence, a risk analyst who works for the bank finishes a financial model that spells disaster for the bank. It's 10pm and he immediately calls his boss, who in turn calls his boss, who in turn calls his boss. So they're taking it seriously - as they should. The validity of the projected losses are subsequently confirmed and by 4am a boardroom filled with the 20 most senior managers realize that a collapse of the whole is inevitable. A tough spot to be in, but at least they know this before any of their competitors and therein lies an opportunity to make a ruthless decision: Save their own company by selling all of their toxic assets. As Jeremy Irons character points out, if you're the first one to get out, you're much more likely to survive. And this is where the moral of this tale lies. It's not about the greed of Wall Street 'fat cats', it's about survival, and the cost of that survival.Great little film, I hope to see more ones like these!",Margin Call
232,Virilene-Manly,One Star For Three Handsome Faces,1,24 January 2016,"The screenplay for this film was as fraudulent as the mortgage-backed securities about which it purported to be. Imagine some cheesy acting class where the actors are told to stand in a circle and improvise dialog about a nonexistent object in the middle of the circle. (They are allowed to pepper their dialog liberally with the expression ""Eff me!"") The actors continually refer to The Thing and the Impending Doom that it will bring, though it is clear that not one of them has any idea what The Thing is, nor do any two of the actors have the same idea. The only thing clear is that Chandor had zero understanding of the mechanics of the financial crisis. The film itself almost works as a metaphor for the fraud perpetuated on the investing public. Chandor attempts to promote the false narrative that it was Youthful Genius in the financial industry who first and most fully understood the global economic implications the fraud. Plenty of blame to go around, and plenty of blind greed to condemn, but the Young Turks were as guilty of lack of understanding, lack of context, and unbridled greed as the Old Heeds. A lot of alleged star power in this film, but I lose regard for anyone associated with this fraud of a production, despite a couple of genuinely handsome faces in the cast. I will probably revise my rating at some point in the future, but I feel so cheated right now by the unfulfilled promise of this film that I'm in a bad mood at the moment. So, ""Eff me!"", Chandor?

To be honest I was a little disappointed. The whole thing just came off as rather flat and ""bloodless"" to me.

I just could not especially get excited by the action of a bunch of people in suits grimly talking about what they seemed to all see as a foregone conclusion, the moves they would have to make, etc. That said, I do feel that the film has an important message at least: through so clearly depicting the utterly immoral (or better, should I say ""Amoral""- a world that where it seems ""morality"" is not even as something real), the utterly non-moral world of Finance Capitalism.

It's dog eat dog, outside and inside the kennel. A dog indeed also plays a small part.Whilst magnificently paid they have all become enslaved to mammon ( I like to get a bit biblical here and there) Jeremy Irons plays a magnificently understated Master of the Universe, Michael Douglas please take note, and his rationalisations are breathtaking to the man in the street, ie moi.Simon Baker performs very well - I have had my doubts.

Then they realize they are at risk too. Their lives and security. Sure, everyone else in the country is at risk of losing too, but really, it's about the individual. The people left behind.

241,philip2014,Good Intentions on road to Wall Street,3,26 January 2012,"Margin Call could have been far better, but wasn't.The over-numerous leading characters – perhaps inevitable with so many big names involved – crowd each other out, and we get to know none adequately. That might work in a jokey 70s blockbuster, but not in a 2010s production about the financial meltdown.Several intended to prompt sympathy – Kevin Spacey as the old salt Sam Rogers, conceivably the rookie 20somethings Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) and Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley) – frankly do not; in a world of hundreds of millions ruined financially ruined by these people, who worries for the relatively herbivorous but complicit, even if marriages have failed and pets have died? It's only the sacked (and thus rarely seen) risk management chief Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) who rates as remotely near-likable, and if he had not been sacked... you know the rest.Partly because of the thinly painted characters, partly because of the sparse office surroundings and limited score, there's little tension. Through-the-night meetings are called, but the dialogue taking place in them and in their water cooler breaks is too long-winded and/or self-pitying to maintain interest. There's an ambitiously lengthy build up to the rapacious dumping of worthless stock on unsuspecting clients, yet when the actual crime arrives, it's a half-baked let-down.Margin Call appears a something-must-be-done response to financial calamity. By contrast the original Wall Street, with just two genuinely filled out characters and made during top-of-bubble markets, executed its drama – ingénu gulled by middle aged monster while dealing screens flicker - unforgettably. The way is open for a genuine blockbuster on the banking mess, and in fashioning it the makers should pare the A-list stars, reject technical jargonising and hammer relentlessly on the human tragedy – that of ruined average Joe, less of the perpetrators, jarred but still affluent.",Margin Call

The characters character and relations are vague but that is one thing that makes it very interesting because you have to think about who they really are and despite not seeming to be 'nice' or people you would want to have a beer with, I at least find them and their actions very interesting. One thing I found almost funny was how many people said '...we talked about this..."" to each other. While not exactly like Lehman, Bear or Merrill, many of the things that occur,esp. treatment of the risk department, were shown----this time what was different was the CEO wanting to know what went wrong and then acting on it. The details of what and when went wrong are vague but that means you can read into it what you maybe have seen on Wall Street.

It starts with the discovery of a possible financial meltdown by a lowly (but still well-paid) analyst and goes all the way up the food chain to the CEO - which is where things really get interesting.This is certainly one of the smartest scripts to be filmed in recent years, giving human faces and voices to the people we have accused (with some justice) of having destroyed the American economy: we have met the enemy, and he really is us. And it's amazing that this is J.C. Chandor's first feature. The pacing is taut throughout, the lighting and camera placement always dead-on. And he has somehow assembled one of 2011's best casts.

249,promo_scan,"Yawn - Give me back my 1,5 hours..",2,30 October 2011,"I saw this labelled as a thriller. There is nothing thrilling about this movie. The closest we get is one of Spaceys many crying scenes over the death of his dog that takes place over the dead dog itself. And really that was not much of a thrill.I saw it with a mate that holds a bachelor in economics and I myself hold a masters in economics and international business management. To say that the subject interests us would be to put it mildly.I am also a great fan of Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey and to a lesser extent I enjoy the work of Tucci, Betthany and Simon Baker. So its not the cast that is at fault in my book.No its an insanely boring and pointless script that does nothing to interest its viewers. The premise is that somebody finally figured out that a economic downturn is about to happen, apparently only Jeremy Irons is old enough to remember that these things do happen once every 20 years or so. The guy that figures it out is at the bottom of the food chain which allows the movie to spend roughly 70% of its play time introducing a new boss that can be flabbergasted at the young gents numbers. Each succession of bosses react mostly the same and by the end you are surprised that they don't call the President of the US nor the British queen to let them know what is going down, everybody else is let in on it.Then you get to wallow a bit in the moral scruples a few of the characters. But they are fictional, working in an unnamed fictional company, so I don't really care.Up to the end we kept hoping there was more to this movie.. A twist, a crime, a plot.. Anything.. But no.. At least the movie stays true to its docile form and does not try to end with a climax or the like.

Afraid of change? Desperate? It's all here.Now that's off my chest, ""Margin Call"" is a masterpiece of cinematographic storytelling, packed all into one day's worth of corporate terror. It's like watching the eventual demise of deep space miners trapped inside a ship now shared by a dual-jawed critter bent on eating them. Only this story plays in NY City at the cusp of our most recent financial ""correction"".I love Kevin Spacey films. When he's on screen, he's in charge, period. His character, Sam Rogers, has found a way to survive at the firm by temporarily loaning his soul to the underworld, only to borrow it back when it's convenient. His locker room speeches, vocalized altruism, and otherwise thoughtless behavior blend together for a nicely written, complex little man who makes big money. He's not alone...There seem to be no end to bad decision-making skills represented here. It's a wonder an economy exists at all if skeletons like these really do run the financial world. Every character is, however, well written, with enough backstory to force believability. We can sympathize with these characters, can't we? Haven't we all been faced with that ""fork in the road"" moment? Which way to turn... Why not let someone else decide? Let someone else make the call. Why turn at all?I especially enjoyed Jeremy Irons' (John Tuld) performance, as the cult leader of this whole blasted charade. We see Tuld as a man certain in his resolve, but questioning of his own constitution. An old guard financial genius, who built his empire on the backs of the less certain. I gave it 7 out of 10 stars because there was still something missing. It's hard to follow a story like this without wanting to watch ""just a little more"" story. Just a little postlude to wrap things up better. It's like a cup of coffee that cools off too soon, requiring you to chug it down while it's still warm enough.But who knows, maybe that's the rub.

253,rachelle-lecuyer,"The Real ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps""",9,20 November 2011,"I pulled ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" from the DVD queue and watched it one afternoon when I was home sick. After I was finished with it I was so disappointed, I pulled the blankets over my head and went to sleep. ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" was not the fast-paced hard core and suspenseful film ""Wall Street"" had been but this is a review of ""Margin Call"" which could also be called, ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" and in fact is a much more credible and believable film about the financial crisis of 2008. ""Margin Call"" picks up where the Wall Street traders and investors have found themselves in 2008 with the bubble ready to pop and pop big at a New York City financial firm. But this is not fast paced and any suspense creeps slowly like the shadows the setting sun casts on the skyline of New York City. The film starts out slow and uneasy and even as the story unfolds, the momentum does not increase as the clock ticks through the night. We sit on the sidelines of a sleepless evening where imminent disaster looms at dawn. The characters are honest. Everything they do is about money. Money, money and more money. They make no effort to hide this reality. The approach they take to solving the crisis they face is to keep themselves rich and let some other poor schmuck be stuck holding the empty bag of unstable investments. Not all of them agree on the solution they ultimately enact but they all go along and it is because of, and you guessed it, money!The film's strongest point is the acting. One expects Stanley Tucci and Kevin Spacey to disappear into their characters and be the foundation of the story but Demi Moore and Simon Baker pull off their roles, too. By saying this, I suppose I am making a bit of a judgment call and being a bit of a snob. Tucci and Spacey are veterans with proved track records for high rate character performances. In this film, I thought the entire cast pulled it off, really working as an ensemble at its best.The younger actors, Zachary Quinto and Penn Badgley, work very well as the juniors of the cast and in portraying the young, somewhat inexperienced staff. Quinto, especially is quite believable as the ""rocket scientist"". Paul Bettany gets my vote for the star of this film. He plays his role beautifully and is in an oddball kind of a way he is the glue that keeps the characters connected. This statement about Mr. Bettany may be argued as Kevin Spacey rounds out the film with two superb scenes. In one of the final scenes of the film, Spacey gives a very unconvincing speech. I thought what is he doing? He could have an Oscar for that performance, what did he just do? Indeed, what he did was truly act! Spacey is also the last character we see in the film. I won't give it away but I will say Spacey plays it ever so well.I really enjoyed this film, just be sure to be caught up on your sleep when you see it, it is a long night, a very long night!",Margin Call

So in the end the dog gets buried. I felt like joining the dog because the dog seemed to be having a better time than I did. ""If we do this"", went the film, ""no-one will ever buy from us again.""

255,srh-291-224016,Liberal Propaganda in a Wonderful Film,10,15 February 2012,"First off, I have the DVD and have watched the movie upward of ten times in the last three weeks. I found it gripping but chocked full of liberal propaganda dissing Wall Street and the concept of working outside of organized labor. Also transforming the objective of the incident as some form of greed rather than simply managing a crisis to avoid loss of the entire enterprise. One very obvious misdirection in the most junior employee; at 23 earning a quarter of a million dollars in the prior year. That would have made him 22 and where were you when you were 22? Still in graduate school. Also, no one earns that kind of money as a junior in risk assessment. All written to denigrate the concept of Wall Street ripping off the honest worker who is represented by a union. There was a plethora of basically normal liberal lies but nothing new so it seemed smooth.The best aspect of the film was the casting of Simon Baker as Jared Cohen, the young senior executive. That was genius. The character could have been styled better, executives in that situation are not foul mouthed, but all in all, genius.",Margin Call

And it should have, because I have been in situations like these guys found themselves in, and none of the critical moments rung true. Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey seemed to want to give their characters a moral or intellectual stance; which I believe is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of these people. Moreover,neither of them emanated much charisma, when by their very nature when they appear in the corporate labywrinth, these powerful people exude it.The exception was Demi Moore. I've never rated her as an actor at all. But she was utterly brilliant as a sly, smart, stony, bitter and survival-obsessed middle manager. At one point in the film, she is given some bad news and the camera holds on her face for about 10 seconds. She manages to communicate hate, fury, fear and resignation without apparently moving a muscle.I'd go just to see her performance, but the film as a whole was too shallow and too lacking in drama to be gripping.",Margin Call
257,hbswan,One of the best 'financial thrillers',9,4 April 2019,"""I think this is one of the best movies of the past several years-or at least the most thrilling, finely crafted, and piercingly insightful one yet made about the 2008 crisis and contemporary capitalism.There is, admittedly, not a lot of competition there. Cynical though it may be, one can understand how profit-minded studio executives might be skeptical of drama manifested in numbers and balance sheets. Most other entries in the genre (let's call it 'financial thriller') tend to be squarely polemical-either satirical depictions of greed like The Wolf of Wall Street or Oliver Stone's 1987 Wall Street, or else advocacy documentaries like Capitalism: A Love Story or Charles Ferguson's Inside Job. Margin Call strikes something of a balance between the two, giving us a sense of the numbing scale and complexity of the crisis as well as the way it affects-and is affected by-the human qualities of the people involved, and for this reason its portrayal of a Wall Street firm feels both more realistic and more insightful. It's the rare fact-based story that finds drama not just in showing what happened, but in trying to understand why it happened.",Margin Call
258,rodolforiverol,Long on drama - weak on facts..,5,28 February 2014,"I've watched Margin Call two or three times on Sundance channel from the comfort of my couch at home. Being one of the victims of the 2008 financial meltdown I sometimes take in a movie during the day. Unfortunately as I pass the time away it's a God awful feeling to be in this predicament, so I almost feel compelled to give a review of this fine film.A cast of all star actors along with a fine screenplay really give meat to this movie as it propels the audience through this riveting edge of your seat day at a NYC investment bank at the dawn of the financial crisis. A strong emphasis on humanizing the problem and what it personally means for these characters is made throughout the movie - who stays, who goes and what it means to them. The plot is simple, in Margin Call a financial analyst discovers that his bank's over leveraged account of mortgage backed securities will inevitably fail and destroy the bank. To ward off impending doom and stave off bankruptcy the bank chooses to sell off its portfolio of mortgage backed securities. A strategy that will ultimately save the bank but destroy the livelihoods of many brokers who will lay off risk to unsuspecting banks under the guise of business as usual. All of this takes place in about a twenty four hour stretch.Through it all, nothing is presented about what precipitated the real financial crisis, who was to blame and how it unfolded. In fact laughably, at one point Jeremy Iron's character tells Keven Spacey's character the new analyst will be promoted because there's going to be ""a lot of money to be made"" getting out of this mess. I can't think of anything that could be further from the truth.On a personal note I have serious doubts about the movie's message and integrity. In real life - from the start everyone knew securities backed by shaky sub-prime mortgages lent out to low credit home buyers were very risky - so, when sub-prime mortgage holders stopped paying their mortgages in large enough numbers it was no surprise. And I'm sure every bank had their fingers on the pulse of these bonds - so the idea that one lone analyst at one single bank would unearth this before anyone else thereby giving his bank the edge is ridiculous.For those of us who have a good grasp on the financial crisis, its causes and repercussions it's a good roller-coaster ride of a movie. Its flaws only adding to our enjoyment, but for someone who doesn't know anything about the crisis I think it's a confusing movie. I give it a five for great acting and screenplay, but fact wise Margin Call tells a warped and lopsided tale. PS I worked in public finance not asset backs, but it affected all of us.",Margin Call
259,margietsiou,The movie is awful,1,10 July 2016,"The story could be interesting if the script was written in an interesting manner. I am really sorry to note that the dialogues are more than awful, they completely lack of intelligence. Actors also lack of good performance - in this movie. I was bored to listen the word ""f***k"" and all its derivatives, it seems that the scriptwriter had no inspiration at all. I do not watch a movie to hear insulting slang every 15 sec. I think it is addressed to people with low level of intellectual capacity. Difficult to watch it until the end, so I did not. The movie attempts to provoke suspense, but to me it provokes discomfort. Unfortunately, Hollywood produces plenty of its kind every year, spending a serious amount of money on meaningless movies, when it could invest in quality concepts. Very few directors dare to work on movies exceeding the narrow Hollywood standards (maybe because they hardly can be funded).",Margin Call

Casting did a fantastic job.",Margin Call
261,alfa_123,Excellent drama of the workings at a Wall Street brokerage,9,30 January 2012,"Being in this profession, I can attest that Margin Call is a realistic portrayal of what happens in a major Wall Street financial house. It will disappoint viewers expecting it to be a ""thriller"", with some sort of deep conspiracy or dark plot. It is none of these things. With an excellent cast, it simply and accurately describes what happens when a bunch of profane (the F-word is used constantly, as a noun, verb (both transitive and intransitive), adverb, and adjective, sometimes all in the same sentence), sexist, back-stabbing, overpaid, arrogant, alpha-male egomaniacs (and that is usually what most of the people at these firms are - women are starting to make inroads but still are largely only minor players on the trading floors) realize that they have made a monumental error and have gotten themselves into a position where the amount they have paid for ""assets"" they are holding (usually some sort of esoteric financial instrument) is likely to be worth a lot less than what they realize they can sell such ""assets"" for. This process, more accurately referred to as arbitrage, is utterly simple but the amounts of money involved are breathtaking - a single trade can literally involve hundreds of millions of dollars of profit, or loss, because, as succinctly pointed out by the head of the (unnamed) firm, Jeremy Irons, for every winner, there is a loser, and vice versa.Some reviewers have suggested that the film portrays what led to the collapse on Wall Street in 2008 but, while there are a few minor similarities (the ""asset"" potentially killing the firm in the film sounds vaguely like the mortgage-backed securities (MBS's) that brought Lehman down), that debacle was caused more by an inadequate general oversight of the capital markets rather than one Wall Street trading house getting itself overextended.In any event, there is nothing inspirational about this film. There is no moral message conveyed. It simply and brilliantly shows how capitalism works, and like it or not, this is what makes the free world tick. Nothing pretty, often ugly, but, notwithstanding the current recession, that's why the free world's economic system produces the highest standards of living in the world over the long run. It is important to note that there is no hint of illegal activity at the firm in the film – indeed, when entering the high-level meeting where it will be decided what to do about the mess they are in, the boss tells his underlings to only tell the truth and not lie. The characters portrayed at this firm may not be lovable but they are not crooks.The actors (and one actress of note, Demi Moore) are excellent. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as the head of trading and Simon Baker absolutely nails the role of his reptilian boss. The animosity Spacey conveys for Baker's character, who is younger than Spacey's, is pure acting skill and there is something hilarious about watching one repellent person sneer at another repellent person. Paul Bettany is perfect as Spacey's number two (his accounting for how he spent his prior year's $2.5 million in salary, which did include sending $150K to his parents, is worth the price of admission). Stanley Tucci is equally brilliant as the cerebral head of risk management who has been fired (""downsized"") just as he is in the process of determining that the firm's financial exposure on these ""assets"" exceeds the firm's capital – and then can't be reached later because the firm's idiotic bean counters have stupidly turned off his cell phone when they escorted him off the premises. Penn Badgley and Zachery Quinto are perfect as the two idealistic young analysts who have the nerve to bring the firm's looming financial catastrophe, passed on to Quinto by Tucci at the last minute, to the firm's senior management. And Irons is superb as the firm's utterly amoral senior executive.Don't expect to like any of these characters. Even the most sympathetic, Spacey and Tucci, ultimately cave in for the money. Nobody in this film is nice and that's the way it is on Wall Street. But it is an excellent film – well worth your time.A note – some reviewers have complained about the film's title, since the financial plot has nothing to do with a ""margin call"" (a process in which an investor is required to post more capital to cover his/her position on an investment that has declined in value). This complaint is technically true but the filmmakers faced a dilemma. The term ""margin call"" is somewhat understandable to potential viewers who do not have knowledge about the workings of Wall Street. They probably would have lost a lot of potential viewers if they had called it ""Arbitrage Gone Wild"" or ""How to Cover a Loss Position on Credit Swaps and Mortgage-Backed Securities"".",Margin Call
262,blueberry-83082,"Great movie, had to watch it twice",10,8 July 2020,"What impressed me in this movie? The list is long.
First, there is no proper action, the movie is static and settled mostly in an office space, but actors managed to create quite strong tension; waiting for the key moments I missed some details and had to watch it a second time.
Actors - brilliant play with given dialogs. A couple of unforgettable moments - the moment Will Emerson realizes the scale of a problem (Paul Bettany) first meeting (Simon Baker rules), Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons - his speech, call for Carmelo (people who watched the movie will know) then his quick reminder what money is, Stanley Tucci - I should start with his first scene with HR people, then his monologue about a bridge. HR ladies... And a lot more.
It doesn't have a plot twist like Shawshank Redemption, which comes to my mind as another rather 'static' brillint movie. The end is not optimistic as it shows a beginning of - what will all remember - big market crash. But it shows mentality of corporation people on different postions, all levels, fired, accidentally involved, etc. in this big, cruel run for a margin. There is lot of understatements, questions hanging in the air and irrelevant questions. Some with cruel answers, some without.

You don't have to know much about how the financial sector works to understand the part the human traits of greed, power and ambition play in this sector.Michael Douglas portrayed aspects of that well in WALL STREET, but in Margin Call, Jeremy Irons is far more of a chilling figure as you never really know exactly what he is thinking in the film. He's very quiet.My favourite scene is actually the boardroom scene where Peter Sullivan is asked to report on what he's found. This scene you can imagine has been played out in boardrooms across America with employees asked to speak freely on what the state of the company is. It was truely a gripping scene where you didn't know how the boss John Tuld, played by Jeremy Irons, was going to react to what he was about to be told.All in all, I think this film is much better than WALL STREET, and a better depiction of the financial crisis and sector.In this film, greed isn't good...Don't miss this film in your online or DVD collection.

First of all, it will take you no time to figure out the film has nothing to do with margin calls and but rather trading desk operations. The technical aspects are pretty accurate, but they never really fully explain the true nature of the issue.The film lacks a protagonist and for that matter antagonist.

The tense emotion of the situation was held steady by the ensemble throughout the film. Bettany, Quinto, and Badgley, all turned in superb performances, but it was Tucci, Spacey, and Irons that stood out as excellent. It was witnessing the brink of a tragedy that draws parallels to the 2006 film, ""Flight 93"" (minus the deep heartbreak ""93"" leaves us with).

273,freecrafted,"""So That...We...May...Survive!""",8,23 October 2011,"So here goes my first review on IMDb.This is a movie for those that want to see the human element when an investment bank realizes their models are wrong and that they are sitting on a large amount of assets worth less than they are currently marked at.There are 2 errors that just about everybody is making about this movie, though. The first is that this movie is about the September 2008 financial crash. That is false. This movie is about the collapse of the CDO/MBS market in *2007*(what led to I-Banks going belly up in 08). That also didn't happen in 1 day(while there were some very bad days), it occurred over several months. Google ""ABX Index"" and select images and you'll see that for yourself. But for the interest of time and simplicity ""Margin Call"" simplified the actions of firms over those several months into 1 day and the actions of dozens(if not hundreds) of people into a handful which is understandable.The second error is that this nameless firm is one of the I-banks that went under or was sold like Lehman, Bear, Merrill, etc. The movie is clearly (in my mind at least) modeled after Goldman Sachs. The first reason is because they are seen as the first I-bank to aggressively try to scale back their exposure to MBS. The second reason would be a spoiler, but lets just say that Goldman is pretty aggressive at ""making way for new blood"" relative to the others even though the movies depiction was way overblown.I think many will be happy to know that the amount of ""inside lingo"" is kept to a minimum, but that doesn't mean that you will be able to understand a handful of things mentioned without a pretty good cursory knowledge of financial jargon. Don't worry though its not needed to understand the movie.For those that are looking for a story depicting causes of the financial crisis this movie isn't it. If your looking for a movie depicting evil people conniving in a board room to screw over the public this isn't it. This movie is about an analyst who discovers that the volatility assumptions in their MBS portfolio were false and that it could very easily take down the entire company. Its a movie depicting the increasingly suspenseful and gripping atmosphere when a firm realizes they are sitting on a large pile of illiquid assets worth less than they thought. Its a movie depicting the concern of particular players that their reputation will be shot when they are forced to market make assets that will ""kill the market"" for MBS.Its a movie that depicts the actions of a firm ""So that...they...may...survive.""Acting was great.

Almost got itches to add ""Uncle"" to Sam, but well, The movie is deeper than it seems as Mr. Chandor is way lots smarter than he seems to be – paradoxically this is beneficial for his end product - aside from lighting the candle at both ends as one character will decree in one of the all-memorable scenes of this piece of art; after all Mr Chandor is both writer and director, so he had all the angles and ropes to squeeze out of an arid, repulsive conjecture such a juicy, vibrant human content delivered with such a heartfelt joy and the most exquisite mastership of the trade in a such unforgettable ""package"" to borrow from this yin-yang, minimalist yet cutting down to the marrow and beyond gobbledygook lingo. Under the enormous abstract pressure of 24/7 assessment of what's cheap and what's steep the team is behaving like red blood humans and out of this epic clash emerge chips of distorted humanity which makes them all the more appealing. In the end, Tuld, on the town as ever in good mood and stamina hits (again) the CTRL+ALT+DEL button throwing the Universe back to another brand new brave day, of course feeding with a healthy appetite on the very corpse of the last night apocalypse. A gamer's crisp plot brilliantly told and acted about a breathtaking ancient Greeklike drama, stark nude and blazing in its utter, primeval simplicity: some nerd in an exquisite gang of streetwise hyper schmucks blows the whistle scared out of his wits some day by an educated guesswork find. The top dog descends (from the ""clouds"") to reset the score table once more and restart the daily music of selling and buying mercifully kicking the damn Cosmos back into its blessed motion. The business object is making good prophecies – Tuld explains them loud and clear The setting, murky, dusky, arcane looks like an Old Testament cave and new prophets are so focused they skip even the purpose of it all and it takes the Man to come down from the skies and shake them awake, reminding them in plain English the upriver and downriver. A++ for Mr. Chandor with this masterpiece of all time drama: abstract, elusive, hard-grit, deep cutting and extremely rewarding no matter what's your CV. It's honed to perfection: words, moods, poker-face deep down stares, background music and sounds on the fringe of imaginary, minimalist, mesmerizing, eerie, defying tonality, electronics and even music itself; it's the sound of a most quiet apocalypse in the making. The production has a synthetic quality in the way out of this world - which in more than in one sense could be said a about everything and everybody as of frame #1 all the way through to the very last one. MC is hypnotic up to sheer addiction. I have seen the movie 7 times (and counting ) and feel I didn't have enough of it. Like a damn junkie just turned loose on crack I simply can't stop helping myself on it on and on. No shame to watch it agape. Due to the nature of its non artistic content, perhaps, this product rings closer to reality show than to another run of the mill movie like so many others. A bunch of top notch numbers crunchers living like kings on figuring out the future shape until the day when one and one don't make two anymore as one of the characters put it in plain English hitting for everyone the nail in the head. Kevin Spacey (Sam Rogers) the slickest longest lasting combinator on town entirely memorable rock-solid pillar of this interface concept: he is the honcho he has the words, all the right words at the right time and in the right place and that's why he's in the business since Adam (not Adam Smith, or so?) and Eve.

Straight from the skies to teach us what plain, good old common sense was once, is and should be ever after – amen! Man, what a nerve! The point he made is simple intelligence without the guidance of the common sense is as pitiful as a beheaded hen. Bereft of his overall, all encompassing, paramount common sense and sharp sight, his underlings would have bumped and bungled into the dark literally and figuratively for ever – foresight, forecasts, schemes, algorithms, computers, Aston Martins and all. Simon Baker (Cohen): His iceberg sideway stare freezes your blood instantly - a class in its own tremendous acting. Pure and simple spellbinding. Devastatingly beautiful craft. Top S.O.B. on the face of the Earth. Epic mimic. Unforgettable. To put on a shelf at Academy for case study. Way beyond Oscars, somewhere in the Milky Way where I expect his effigy to be seen through the most powerful telescopes.

278,Chiyanchan,The fire sell was the margin call,9,1 April 2012,"I am just responding to a lot of so called people holding master in economics and expert in finance. Numerous comments are criticizing the name of the movie has nothing to do with a margin call...The fire sales itself is the margin call.The call to the CEO informing him the firm exposure already exceed the company net value is the margin call.It is an internal margin call made by the junior analyst that ""woke"" up everyone from their dream. So in order to survive, they made the fire sales.Also, those criticizing this movie is naive and saying it is impossible for the I banker not informing the president of the united states are petty damn naive. If you knew you can sell these toxic asset before the music ends, will you call the US president to stop the music immediately before you can sell?",Margin Call
279,iBelgium,"Big cast, no money left for good plot or director!",1,24 November 2014,"I never heard of J.C. Chandor before this movie, but it wasn't a pleasant acquaintance. To be brief, I felt no tension in the entire movie.The story is about the first bank at the start of the financial crisis that notices that it has to sell all its toxic products. At first I expected way more numbers. OK, the model is bad, but show us the model you are talking about! OK, the equation we used doesn't work, what is that equation? I understand that you don't want to bore us with all these economic details, but since the title is ""margin call"" you might expect that a lot of people with economic backgrounds would be interested in these things! And even the common folks aren't that ignorant that you can at least give us a short introduction to margin and what a margin call is.Second, I understand it's a short story, but why not show us more details. Show us some graphics, show us what the real life consequences are, show us some background about the characters, show us some more conflicts between the characters.However, seeing this big cast, I think that's where all the money went. So no money left to work out a good story, some nice scenery or a good director! PS: If these top dogs make so many millions per year, I expected to see some Rolex watches and cuff links on their shirts!",Margin Call
280,sorin-452-898641,Such a waste,4,25 March 2013,"Somebody wrote a review titled ""Fantastic movie ..."" and gave it 9 out of 10, then elaborated. The funny thing is, I mostly agree with what he wrote in the detailed review: this movie packs some stellar performance from a dream cast of top class actors. That's why I gave it the 4 stars (out of 10). Unfortunately, all that talent is wasted in a movie that basically has no plot to speak of, that is piling up clichés sky-high, where the characters are terribly shallow and, worst of all, in my opinion, that spoils it for other, potentially much better movies that could have been made on the topic of the financial crisis. And I was specifically thinking about someone possibly turning Michael Lewis's ""The Big Short"" into a movie that would have certainly been much more endearing than this soulless creation.",Margin Call
281,sfarney20,An Apocalyptic Masterpiece,9,3 September 2012,"These are the capitalists of the new millennium who trade abstract property for abstract cash. But there is a deeper message here, either inherent in the subject or carefully sewn into the fabric of the script. This is a world of consummate liars -- who believe each other's lies. And even having lived with the lies for years, character after character performs the dreaded deed on the verbal promise of more than a million dollars -- from people who advise them to cheat their own grandmothers. It is a picture of catastrophic instability, both financially and ontologically. Margin Call is a good companion dish to Blade Runner and other apocalyptic masterpieces.",Margin Call
282,neddyj_99,I didn't think this was as great a film as many others here think...,6,26 May 2013,"While I don't work on Wall Street - I do work as an adviser at one of the major wirehouses and my background makes me interested in movies like ""Margin Call"" to see how they depict this business. I think this is one of the things that this film did very well - depict the business. It also had a very good cast and did a very good job at helping the audience understand a bit better how the financial collapse happened.My problem with it is purely from a film perspective. This movie reminds me of ""The Bad Lieutenant"" - it starts out at a low point and then grinds lower until the end of the film. Hollywood films generally have happy endings, and while this one does not - my problem is the lack of a story / character arc. The film is interesting, but there are multiple protagonists - none of whom change through the film, they just slowly realize how screwed they are. This does not make for a great film. The Antagonist is arguably Jeremy Irons character who is introduced halfway through the film. Because the film is really just documenting several characters who are slowly realizing how badly they're screwed, there is absolutely no suspense. The only suspense at all that is created is from Kevin Spacey's character who doesn't want to do the plan that Jeremy Irons has proposed - out of morals and business ethics. That's fine - but again, Kevin Spacey doesn't change throughout the film, he just gets more depressed about the path that they're on and tries to make his voice heard that it's the wrong thing to do.So that's my review - as a film, I didn't think it worked well. It wasn't suspenseful enough to be a suspense film, and if it was purely a drama - it had a business scandal that lacked sexiness (didn't even replace that with the bankrolling that some of these wall street types are thought to exhibit)- and it wasn't all that dramatic - again the drama was watching this slow realization in all the characters...and therefore wasn't all that moving. Good performances and interesting story make it an above average film - but it fails to be very good because of these shortcomings.",Margin Call

Honestly its just a boring long night in a banking institution.The cast is cool, great acting, but nothing genuinely interesting happens, it may be realistic, but then call it a documentary....this was boring.Did i mention boring, I cant imagine this got such high reviews on Netflix and here so I had to warn others.",Margin Call

285,lauragustine,Made me want to burn down a bank,1,23 May 2016,"This film presents us with a group of traders who discover that, oops, they may have made a teeny, weeny error and are about to crash the bank, plunge the Western world into recession and cost millions of people their jobs and homes.As they scrabble to save their sorry backsides the film makers clearly hope that the viewer will feel sorry for them. This on the rather thin grounds that: 1. they're all terribly good-looking; 2. they're only doing what they've been told to do; 3. trading and making obscene amounts of money is 'all they've ever wanted to do' (yup, stand back, this guy has a dream); 4. the people they work for are even more hideous than they are.In a desperate bid to extract some sympathy from the viewer Kevin Spacey cries over his dead dog and attempts to flee the impending chaos, only to be reined back in by CEO Jeremy Irons. Mr Irons is allowed to retain his British accent to ensure that the American audience will immediately realize that he is a being of pure unadulterated evil. He snacks casually while Rome burns and offers Kevin a slice of puppy sandwich while insisting he sticks around to make yet more money.Well, these are the people who rule the world, film studios included, so I suppose they have to try to make you believe that they have redeeming qualities. Even if you don't, they all got off Scot free anyway so what you think of them is really of very little importance.",Margin Call

It's not the greed of the bankers that caused 2008, it's the greed of the people they represented: the willing public who wanted to live beyond their means and rewarded those who let them. smart people i spoke to years before - when cornered on 'how can america keep buying goods from abroad without making enough to pay for it not go bankrupt' - would explain to me the concepts behind economics according to which that couldnt happen.

289,tevasisgladiatora,"It was raining, so there wasn't a mach",1,25 May 2017,"There is no story in the movie. One day you realize the firm is bankrupt, and you find a way to save it by getting rid of your people. Absolutely stupid! You are leveraged to the bone and you sell your portfolio at an average price of 80% and you survive? Some one needs to learn us all how this miracle happens. I have seen absurd in a movie, but this film is for people who can not even count. What was the point of bringing back the fired risk manager to work? Why was the guy losing his job crying in the toilet? On this exact day, if only this one firm was selling there was a far easier approach. It seems that no one knew about the problem, so it would have been easier for them to sell the firm which has much lower market cap than their highly leveraged portfolio of low volume mortgage bonds.Totally ridiculous crap without any point in the movie. What were they saving and how? I can not believe some one can spend so much money on cast, but did not hire one university student to explain them some basic financial stuff. In conclusion what we have learned from this movie? 1. If your company is bankrupt and you have lost all your money, fire everyone and you will not lose your already lost money ( what an absurd)2. If you have a leveraged firm and you have to sell it. Try to sell the assets not the equity. It is way easier( at least the film says so)3. If you have the brain of building rockets for NASA, you take it very emotional not to get fired from the only firm you can work for.4.

290,jtom-29387,Wrong title for a great movie,9,20 May 2018,"Many people considered this like a continuation of Wall Street. To me it looks much better, because it has a much more balanced view of the finance industry.The movie was so realistic that it seemed real and made me wonder who the unnamed company was. What was interesting that people from so many different levels were presented, all of them very well paid, all them willing to burn the midnight oil, and all of them trying to do what they thought best for the company.There was no false sentimentalism, their business was to make money. Once they figured out that the ground was shifting under them, they did the logical thing, getting rid of the toxic assets at the first chance. This was their job, not saving the world.So I had more sympathy for the Jeremy Irons character than for the Kevin Spacey characters. All the actors were very good as was the direction and the dialogue. It makes me wonder which company provided the inspiration for the movie. Because of its quality it could have been only Goldman Sacks or Morgan Stanley. Since GS went relatively early out of MBS and since one of the management sacrificial lambs was a woman I think it was Morgan Stanley.",Margin Call
291,glen-171,"Very realistic movie, that captures the feelings and atmosphere perfectly",10,26 July 2019,"The movie is great, and massively underrated!!As a person that worked during the financial crisis in the financial sector, and have earlier in my career, like Zechary Quinto's character, attended board meetings as the main risk specialist, doing a (much smaller) crisis. I can say that this is very realistic. From constantly searching for errors or inconsistencies in your risk models or risk measures, and then finding something. To then reacting, and trying to convey the importance of your findings to the upper management. To the way your are instructed to only speak when asked to, in the boardroom. And when asked to speak, you are somehow more articulate than at any other point in your life, and you see the effect of your words on powerful people, and that your words creates action. A rush!! This movie captures the moments, the tension and atmosphere better than all other movies I have seen, and perhaps also better than real life!?
All the actors are all phenomenal, and are portraying people I can recognize from the jobs I have had; even the ones you might find to be over the top characters, like the CEO!
I can only speculate that the feelings I have towards this movie are like the feelings of a veteran of the Vietnam war, watching Platoon. That veteran and I, both want to remember the feelings we had at that moment.If you work in the financial sector, then this is a must see movie!",Margin Call
