0,MartinHafer,Very clever--and I am amazed they could sustain the film's momentum throughout.,9,3 December 2011,"I am amazed that folks from the studio that made this had no idea how to market it and actually shelved it for several years. It SHOULD have done extremely well in the theaters, as it's an exceptionally made and very quirky little film. It's a parody of slasher films and manages to enchant the viewer throughout.The film begins with a group of annoying college kids heading off for the clichéd camping trip in the woods. Soon they see some local hillbillies who the kids have convinced themselves might just be killers such as you'd see in a slasher film or ""Deliverance"". However, two of these locals, Tucker and Dale, are very sweet and peaceful guys despite their appearance. But, every time they appear, the idiots think the pair are killers and they overreact. It's all rather funny--but the fun is yet to come.Later, when the pair are out fishing at night, the young idiots who are camping nearby go swimming. When one of them sees the two, she assumes they have come to kill her and she falls into the water--hitting her head on the way down to the water. She'll drown but Dale jumps into the water and saves her. But, her friends THINK the pair have killed Allison and they run in terror. Not knowing what to do, they take her back to their cabin and Dale makes her pancakes. No big deal, right? WRONG!! The idiot young folks assume Allison is dead and they decide to attack--and a long and crazy chain of events takes place that only serves to convince them more and more that Dale and Tucker were serial killers! There's more....but I don't want to spoil the sick fun.The plot idea for this film would make a great 20-30 minute movie. I wondered how they could sustain it for 90 minutes--but they did. How? Well, the key is that they made Dale and Tucker (particularly Dale) so gosh-darn likable as well as complex. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that this film will become a cult favorite, as it has a lot going for it. Great acting, writing and direction--I sure can't wait to see more from these folks. What a fine movie.While it might not surprise you, this IS a very, very bloody film. My wife and I laughed at the blood and gore and you probably will, too. But I would NOT let kids see this one, that's for sure.Also, during the scene with the crazy guy firing the revolver, note how the gun fires 10-12 bullets without reloading. I don't' think this is a mistake--more just an inside joke, as such a gun would run out of bullets long before this.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
1,Leofwine_draca,"Nice idea, shame about the execution",5,18 August 2014,"TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL is a comic horror film with a twist: the villains are actually the good guys, and vice versa. What starts out as a standard 'hillbilly' horror flick, in which a bunch of vacationing teenagers find themselves at the mercy of a couple of murderous rednecks out in the backwoods, soon turns into a broad spoof of the horror genre as a whole.The twist is that the rednecks are the good guys and the inevitably gory slayings that occur are a result of accidents and plain bad luck. This premise gives the film some novelty value, but unfortunately it aims at the lowest common denominator for the most part and the humour is obvious and predictable.It's fair to say that the writing is better than the direction here, because there are some subtle character bits written in amid all the mayhem and destruction. The performances of Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are both decent, as the guys form a good double act which carries them through the rest of the movie. The deaths are very cheesy and the low budget is always more than apparent, but if you're looking for something different then you might just enjoy this.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
2,SnoopyStyle,hilarious premise,8,6 December 2017,"A group of college friends are going camping in the woods when they encounter two creepy hillbillies. It's beer-loving, affable Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk) going to fix up their newly bought vacation cabin. As the young people go night swimming, Allison (Katrina Bowden) hits her head and is rescued by Dale and Tucker. The other friends fear that she had been kidnapped.The premise is a hilarious twist on the traditional hillbilly killer horror. Labine and Tudyk are a funny duo. The switch in point of view is inventive. The first half is near perfect. When Tucker gets taken, the premise breaks down a little. The miscommunication becomes not simply situational but rather willful ignorance. It takes it one small step closer to silly away from the smart writing. On a minor note, the opening should not give away part of the ending. It would be better setup if the college kids are horror fans watching a Texas Chainsaw adjacent movie. That would truly spoof the traditional horror narrative.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
3,nogodnomasters,GIRLS CAN SMELL FEAR,10,7 December 2018,"Through a series of misunderstandings two West Virginia Hillbillies are mistaken for slashers. This is to slasher films what ""Zombieland"" is to zombie films. What is good about the film is that the writers were able to keep up the mistakes and errors for the entire film at the same comedy intensity. Genius. This film is a keeper for those who love the horror/comedy genre.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex talk, very brief nudity (Chelan Simmons -even with zoom and slo-mo)",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
4,kosmasp,It happens,9,26 December 2010,"You could argue that the ""sh"" is missing, but then again it works like it is too. And things happen of course ... but not like they happen in the movie that is. But that's why it's a movie. And still the writers have put quite a bit of thought into this and it is more then coherent. Well as much as a movie with a crazy premise (as seen here) can be of course.After seeing Alan Tyduk in Firefly, I've seen him in two comedies. Apart from this also in the ""Death at a Funeral"" (the UK version that is). And he is genuinely funny. And he fits really good in this one too. The comedy almost never feels forced either (which is a big deal with movies that have a ""high concept"" as this one). Watch it and be entertained",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
5,gavin6942,Best Horror Comedy Since Zombieland,7,28 March 2011,"Two friends buy a vacation home together, which is a cabin in the woods. A series of misunderstandings follow, leading a group of college kids to accuse them of being deranged serial killers. What ensues is both hilarious and gory...Let me first point out the great cast: Tyler Labine as Dale, Alan Tudyk (""Dodgeball"" and ""Knight's Tale"") as Tucker. A sexy newcomer named Katrina Bowden as Allison, and Jesse Moss (""Dear Mr. Gacy"") as Chad. The rest of the cast is also great, but these key roles made the whole thing perfect and the comedy a smash.My girlfriend and I saw this at HorrorHound Weekend in Indianapolis, and we loved it. I would say she loved it even more than me, with it keeping her laughing the whole time. That, and she loves wood chippers. Yes, there is a wood chipper, and yes, it does get used. That alone should make you want to see it!The version we saw was a work print, so not all the special effects were in place yet. But the humor is what carries the film -- the whole idea of college kids being the heroes and hillbillies being cannibals... it is taken here and twisted, with no real bad guys at all. (The title is somewhat misleading... at no point did the guys fight ""evil"".)I wish I could write a better review, but I could only do that if I pointed out flaws, and there just are not any I can think of. It was well-paced, funny, bloody, sexy (though there is never any nudity) and somewhat charming. This is really a horror-comedy that I think everyone can get behind.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
6,Woodyanders,Excellent and inspired horror comedy blast,8,20 June 2013,"Redneck best buddies Tucker and Dale venture into the remote woods to fix up their rundown mountain vacation home. Things go horribly awry when the amiable duo are mistaken for murderous backwoods hillbilly psychopaths by a group of obnoxious college kids. Director/co-writer Eli Craig and co-writer Morgan Jurgenson ingeniously subvert and poke fun at the standard conventions and stereotypes associated with evil hicks in the sticks fright fare: The rednecks this time are hapless victims of unfortunate circumstance, the college kids are the judgmental and xenophobic villains of the piece, and the gruesome deaths of said college kids are the direct result of their own fear and stupidity. Better still, this picture makes a valid satirical point about the perils of buying into preconceived assumptions on people while still delivering plenty of tasty over-the-top graphic gore. Moreover, the fine acting by the bang-up cast keeps everything humming: Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk display a winningly loose and natural chemistry as the lovable good-natured protagonists, Katrina Bowden contributes a hugely appealing performance as the sweet Allison, and Jesse Moss brings a deliciously hateful zeal to his juicy role as belligerent frat boy jerk Chad. The crisp widescreen cinematography by David Geddess gives the movie an impressively polished and atmospheric look. The twangy'n'shivery score by Mike Shields hits the stirring spot. An absolute hoot.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
7,rmax304823,"Lawd, Where'd Ye Put The Redman?",6,7 June 2014,"I didn't get to see the whole thing but the first half hour or so was diverting, full of rustic humor, and probably aimed at the good folk who love slasher movies and are ready for a parody.Half a dozen college kids go camping in Appalachia, setting up their tents at a location in which a bunch of kids very much like themselves were slaughtered by inbred Hillbillies. (Think ""Deliverance."") And in fact there ARE two semi-natural but good-natured redneck enjoying a fishing vacation at their nearby vacation home -- a dilapidated dump of a shack.The two groups meet. The well-bred kids misunderstand the intentions of the rednecks and comic scenes ensue.It seems well enough written. The gags are worthy of smiles. The acting is about what you'd expect. The direction goes overboard in bringing in hoary clichés. (A hand reaches out and touches the shoulder of a terrified blond, and there is a sting on the sound track, but it's only a friend.) If it were genuinely comic it wouldn't need to stoop so low.Still, if it were on again I'd try to watch it all the way through. Unless it turns into a bath tub of gore with meat hooks and so forth, it might be enjoyable.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
8,BA_Harrison,You'll smile and laugh.,8,21 September 2011,"If you're a seasoned viewer of backwoods horror and, even after all that you have seen, can still buy into the idea that not all hillbillies are out to rape you in the ass, gut you like a pig or wear your face like a mask, then Tucker & Dale vs Evil will prove to be one hell of a funny film, an ingenious, very witty and delightfully gory take on all of those movies in which good looking teens wind up suspended from a meat-hook in a dilapidated shack littered with human remains and chicken feathers.Despite looking like inbred psychos, pals Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) are actually a pair of well-meaning, beer-swilling good ol' boys who have at last realised their dream of owning a vacation home in the woods where they can rest their weary bones after a hard day's fishing; to the group of college kids camping nearby, however, they embody everything they have ever learnt about rednecks from countless slasher films—uncouth, uneducated, drooling inbred half-wits in dungarees who more than likely feast on the flesh of city-folk.When the teens decide to go skinny dipping one night (clearly having not paid THAT much attention when watching horror films), their worst fears appear to be justified when they witness one of their number—sexy blonde Allison (Katrina Bowden)—seemingly being abducted by Tucker and Dale in their rowboat. In reality, the pair have just rescued the girl from drowning, and are taking her to their cabin to recuperate, but convinced that they mean to do harm to their friend, the campers decide to fight back with disastrous and bloody results.With such an inspired yet simple set-up, Tucker and Dale could so easily have become a stale one-joke movie, but thanks to likable performances from Tudyk, Labine and Bowden and a consistently amusing and sometimes downright hilarious script that gives affectionate nods towards old genre favourites, takes a neat turn towards the end by introducing a real psycho, and even includes messages about prejudice and self belief, Tucker and Dale is a hugely satisfying, strangely heartwarming horror parody and a refreshing change from all those bloody remakes and sequels.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
9,paul_haakonsen,A cult movie in the making...,8,31 July 2011,"Holy... This movie was just phenomenal. I thought I was in for a comedy, but ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" was more than just your average comedy. This movie definitely have potential to become a cult classic. You take a pinch of classic mid-80's horror movie, throw in a dash of dark, twisted comedy, and top it off with wonderful characters, and voilà, you have ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"".The story is very good and interesting. You have two ""hill billies"", pardon my expression, but it is what they are called in the movie, Tucker and Dale who are heading into the woods to fix up their newly bought cabin. Then you have a group of college teenagers out in the woods partying and drinking (fairly typical 80's theme right there). Then with the turns of events the groups run into one another. The teenagers thinking that Dale and Tucker are hill billy killers, while Dale and Tucker only want to get Allison back to them. And from there on, things escalate and become hilarious.""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" have just the right amount of gore, blood, sick comedy and funny situations in it to make it all work so well. I was thoroughly entertained from beginning till end. And I must say that this movie is way up there on my list of favorite movies. The way that the people die in the movie is off the charts. I loved those scenes, especially because their deaths were usually self-inflicted, which just added to the absurdity of the movie plot.The cast in the movie was great, especially Dale (played by Tyler Labine) and Tucker (played by Alan Tudyk) were phenomenal. They really brought so much chemistry to the characters and made it an unforgettable movie.If you haven't already seen ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"", then get in gear and do so, because this movie is definitely one you don't want to miss out on. Once in awhile you just stumble upon a cult classic by accident or sheer luck, ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is one of those movies.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
10,Quinoa1984,"a much needed, outrageously funny and heart-warming look at slasher movies (NOT Scream)",9,29 September 2012,"Sometimes a movie has to be made just to be a proper counter to so much that's come before it. I'm almost surprised this film hasn't existed before (not to say there haven't been critical analyses of horror conventions in horror comedies going back years, Student Bodies and of course the first couple of Scream movies come as good examples). But with this and Cabin in the Woods, it's hard to ever *really* go back to the way slasher movies used to be, the kind like Mother's Day or something where you got a bunch of hicks who go after seemingly helpless teens/twenty-somethings in the woods. Because here, not only are the roles reversed - the couple of hicks who have a cabin (and many sharp objects) who are suddenly the target of paranoid and freaked-out college kids - but it goes through a deconstruction of certain tropes in general.In a way it almost goes into romantic comedy territory in small bursts, as Dale (Tyler Labine, a much needed boost after drek like Good Ol' Fashioned Orgy) saves a young girl named Allison from drowning who was part of the college pack, and, being a genuinely friendly and nice guy (if not the best at approaching them, as we see early on), gets closer to her... well, that is until the other college kids, who think he and Tucker (the always splendid Alan Tudyk) have kidnapped her in their creepy cabin, which in reality is Tucker's summer home he's remodeling. More to the point, the whole film functions in its satire like a big but sincere Looney Tunes cartoon about mis-communication. In fact, I'd love it if this was shown in intro to communications classes in colleges, aside from its entertainment value, since it goes aways to show how we as a people mess up how we relate to one another through ALL pre- conceived notions.This isn't to say all hicks are pleasant and just want a couple of beers in a fishing boat, and not all college kids are arrogant and over-reactive morons. What Eli Craig and Morgan Jurgenson do so well with their script, and the subsequent direction, is keep the comedic pace so strong through so much of the film - at least the first two thirds before some revelations come forth - with a sort of 'checklist' as to the things that could happen. I kept thinking 'where could they go from here?' with how crazy it gets with the kills, which to one side are the maniac murders of Deliverance-folk and to the other side as the psychotic goals of a bunch of kids with a suicide pact(!) And yet with all of the beautiful set- ups and pay-offs of the gags, or the randomness of the VERY bloody violence (I appreciated that, and it really made it gut-bustingly funny, just for how long they would show things), it's still believable core characters that keep it going.I loved seeing Tucker and Dale as an on-screen buddy team, though it's hard to see this going past this one movie (maybe Tucker and Dale's Chainsaw Massacre is up next?) Tudyk and Labine drive their friendship to the audience right from the start, and their humor is much more natural than what one would expect even from a more broad parody. If anything the broadest characters are the dumb sheeple-like college kids following one super-deranged kid in a polo t-shirt with some backwoods- hick murder issues. While this doesn't mean the film wont' sometimes go into some of the territory its making fun of, that is characters doing stupid things when they should know better, in context it still works and is never less than a full blown crowd-pleaser.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
11,BandSAboutMovies,Fun!,6,9 March 2019,"Ucker and Dale vs. Evil plays with the conventions of the slasher and redneck film to great comedic effect. It's written and directed by Eli Craig, who started as an actor (he's in The Rage: Carrie 2) before creating this movie.Allison (Katrina Bowden, Cerie from TV's 30 Rock), Chad, Chloe, Chuck, Jason, Naomi, Todd, Mitch and Mike are on their way to a camping weekend in West Virginia. While buying beer at a gas station, they meet Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk from Firefly and Tyler Labine from TV's Reaper), two well-meaning rednecks who have just achieved a major life goal by buying a vacation home.Tucker tries to talk to Allison, but he's awkward and ends up frightening everyone. Obviously, they've already judged everyone they're going to meet in the country. On the way to their cabin, Tucker and Dale are pulled over by the sheriff, who warns them about how dangerous the woods are.While the college kids are in the woods, Chad tells them all about the Memorial Day Massacre, an attack by hillbillies that happened twenty years ago. Following the slasher movie conventions, the kids ho skinny dipping but instead of being killed, Allison slips and hits her head. As Tucker and Dale are fishing nearby, they see this and save her life. But to everyone else, it looks like they kidnapped her.Everything from here on out is all about perceptions and misunderstandings. Only Allison is able to see Tucker and Dale for what they are, truly nice guys who just live somewhere different than them. Of course, these kids are morons and they end up impaling themselves on trees and getting themselves killed, which only puts more blame on our heroes.It turns out that Chad's mother was the lone survivor of the Memorial Day Massacre, which means that when he goes crazy, he sees killing Tucker and Dale as the perfect revenge. And because Allison earlier turned down his advances, he thinks that her being friends with the duo is a form of Stockholm Syndrome. Even worse, it turns out that all the clippings in the house and the sawmill reveal that Chad's father - and not any hillbillies - was the actual murderer behind those killings twenty years ago.Will Tucker and Allison survive and go out on a date? Will Dale ever bowl again after Chad cuts off his fingers? Or will Chad kill off everyone? These questions will all be answered when you watch Tucker and Dale vs. Evil.I really enjoyed this movie. It doesn't take anything seriously and is more fun the more you love the movies that inspired it. There have been discussions of a sequel, which I would love to see.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
12,Coventry,"Routine sitcom humor, nicely wrapped in a gory format.",6,30 November 2011,"""Tucker and Dale VS Evil"" is basically the long-feature horror movie equivalent of all those pretty lame comedy sitcoms that my mother always watches You know, the ones where every single episode is exactly the same. It goes like this: everything begins with one small and extremely banal misunderstanding, like maybe something that someone has misheard or misinterpreted. Then subsequently, this banal misunderstanding takes on exaggeratedly humongous proportions. People overhear only parts of conversations, draw incorrect conclusions, revert to ancient clichés and suddenly every dialog/monologue is written in an ambiguous style. Admittedly it's rather strange that this derivative and overindulged formula nevertheless resulted in a movie that several hundreds of people have referred to as one of the best horror comedies ever and even upholds a powerful current 7.6/10 score here on IMDb. I'm certainly not claiming that I didn't like ""Tucker and Dale VS Evil"", but I definitely think it's overrated. The basic idea to introduce two particularly sympathetic and downright stereotypical West-Virginian hillbillies and have THEM chased by a group of crazed and overly violent city teenagers (instead of vice versa) is undoubtedly original and close to brilliant. Especially with the revival of backwoods horror recently – there are the remakes of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" but also new popular franchises like ""Wrong Turn"" and many others – there are numerous horror that generated a sort of universal fear of yokels. This makes especially the beginning of the movie very funny. The teenagers know all the urban legends and seen all the backwoods slasher movies, so they're petrified of Tucker and Dale during their first encounter at a remote gas station. They, on the other hand, are completely unaware of their horrific image and just act friendly. Their ignorance versus the close-mindedness of the teenagers results in a few hilarious moments. But then the accumulation of coincidences, unfortunate accidents and misunderstandings becomes just too absurd. Also, the gore in combination with slapstick only works in very small portions. Dumb kids impaling themselves or stupidly blowing their own brains out is not that amusing, in fact. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk give away amiable performances as the titular goody-two-shoes hicks and Katrina Bowden is just too cute as the only tolerant teenager. The rest of the cast forgettable and additional screen-filling.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
13,hitchcockthelegend,Bloody and Bloody Hilarious.,9,31 October 2011,"Tucker & Dale vs Evil is directed by Eli Craig who also co-writes the screenplay with Morgan Jurgenson. It stars Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden and Jesse Moss. Music is by Michael Shields and Andrew Kaiser and cinematography by David Geddes. Plot has Tudyk and Labine as two harmless mountain/country men who head to their newly acquired vacation home in the woods to fix it up and get some R & R. But after a misunderstanding at a roadside store with some college kids, who think Tucker & Dale are hillbilly psychopaths, the wheels are set in motion for a bloody battle for survival, but who for?!In 1996 Scream came slashing forward to inject witty life into a fading horror genre, with freshness and inventive splinters from the slasher formula, Wes Craven's movie rocked the horror faithful's world. Tucker & Dale vs Evil will not have the same impact, its limited release and low budget worth ensured it never had a chance of being a big thing, but still it's the freshest horror/comedy to have come out since Scream made its bloody bow at the box office.It's such a simple idea at the core, you have to wonder why it wasn't thought of before? Craig and Jurgenson have flipped the age old Hillbilly Killers vs Preppy College Kids idea on its head, and in the process smothered it gleefully with dark humour, laugh out loud moments and inventive deaths. There's also some social comedy nestled nicely in the narrative, big points about first impressions and ideas of stereotypes, and hell yes! There's even an opposites attract arc - though that admittedly helps to bog the picture down as the central joke premise runs out of steam towards the end. In fact were it not for a relatively sloppy finale, this would surely be falling into sub-genre classic status. Thankfully all that comes before it is so full of vim and vigour, blood and bluff and fun and frolics, it's not hard to forgive the debut director his one misstep.The neat trick is having the film unfold from the Hillbillies viewpoint, where the carnage that unspools gets increasingly difficult for them to explain, this in spite of their innocence. Each death is logical to the college kids who go on the attack when one of their number, they think, is kidnapped. And it's logical to us the audience as well, were it not for us being privy to these wonderfully funny sequence of events, we too would have them hung, drawn and quartered after a guilty verdict was reached in 10 seconds. This is the ultimate horror/comedy flip-flop movie. So many funny sequences light up the picture, with a chainsaw scene one of the finest moments to have ever graced a horror comedy movie, but the dialogue, too, is not found wanting in the fun and charming department. Cast are on top form, with Tudyk & Labine a most agreeable double act, where their comedy timing is impeccable, and Bowden & Moss are more than just pretty faces.Craig (Sally Field's son) has started with a bang, if he can top this then he is a name to really get excited about. If he can't top it? Well he will at least always have one of the best horror comedy movies on his CV. Yes it's that good, fans of Scream, Severance, Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland should seek it out post haste. 8.5/10",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
14,Scarecrow-88,Tucker and Dale vs. Evil,10,31 August 2016,"Brilliant, wonderfully absurd, backwoods slasher black comedy (graphic violence included) defines quite significantly that ""looks can be deceiving"". Two lovable hillbillies, Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine), are misjudged by misguided college students, on a vacation in the woods, who consider them menacing creeps just because of their attire and not-so-clean-shaven appearance. Neither is violent at all, just up at Tucker's newly bought ramshackle cabin to start renovation repairs. Dale has eyes on blond honey, Allison (the yummy Katrina Bowden), but when she sees him and Tucker in their fishing boat while about to swim, the psychology major slips after freaking out and falls in the water, nearly drowning. Tucker and Dale load her in the boat, saving her because she had a concussion, but her friends believe they are kidnapping her! When they say, ""We got your friend!"" they think Tucker and Dale are warning them! Early on, when Tucker and Dale first see them and vice versa, the latter approaches Allie in the hopes of talking to her (encouraged by Tucker when Dale thinks he's not good enough), but having a scythe in his hand and a nervous giggle scares them all! Chad (Jesse Moss; Ginger Snaps)--the ringleader of the gang--vows to rescue Allie from the ""murderous psycho hillbillies"". What instead happens is the feckless kids start trying to upend what they believe are threats to them and their friend's life but only walk right into their own deaths! Hilarity ensues like one of the kids believing Tucker, who cut into a log which had a hornet's nest, is running after him with a chainsaw (all he is actually doing is fleeing from the hornets!), which causes him to flee through the woods recklessly, impaling himself on a sharp tree sticking out! One of the kids charges towards Tucker, who is operating a woodchipper, falling headfirst into the machinethe legs sticking out, with all the spewing blood, as Tucker tries to save him is another grisly highlight (the sheriff driving up on Tucker and Dale dragging the legs and waist of the dead victim has to be seen to be believed). There's a sequence of startling events where a weedeater blade carves a face, a fire starts (ignited further by moonshine!), and gas canisters (on the inside of the cabin!) send Tucker's ""dream home"" to go up in flames! Perhaps one of the kids lighting up a cig didn't help matters. A loose plank in the cabin is leaned on by the sheriff who actually listens to Tucker and Dale when appearances seem to say they've just killed a few kids, receiving a wood block with nails right into his forehead! Retrieving the dead sheriff's gun, one of the kids points the weapon at his face while unlocking the safety, shooting himself! Another kid dives at Dale while he and Allie are digging a hole (the kids think he is forcing Allie to dig her own grave!) for an outhouse, causing the kid to impale himself on the handle of the shovel! Chad, who tells his posse about a campfire tale about a camping massacre on Memorial Day, actually admits (during a ""counseling session"" where Allie wants him and Dale to talk things over peacefully) that his mom and dad were involved in that! A revelation involving Chad's history will only further send him off the deep end (the movie does well at recognizing that Chad is a bit too excited about engaging in violence with the hillbillies).The film opens with Tucker giving Chad what seemed like an ominous look (he was in the middle of a request for supplies), reading off a list of items which would ideally indicate him and Tucker are backwoods serial killers. Then you see them talk once their outside, harmless and affable; from their perspective, there would be no reason to fear them. But then the film looks at Tucker and Dale from the side of the college kids, presenting them as sinisterthe direction is fantastic at these dueling perceptions. Allie realizing that Tucker is a sweetheart who wouldn't harm anybody, and Dale is oblivious to why her friends are running around hysterically (both Tucker and Dale question if they are ""off their meds""!) is a fun development, too. The kids just can't help but invite disaster upon themselves. A real gem. Sadly, despite being a festival circuit darling, the movie never got a deserved theatrical run. It is better than most wide releases these days.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
15,Hey_Sweden,One of the most entertaining movies that I've seen in a long time.,9,13 January 2012,"With hicks and horror having made such good bedfellows for such a long time, it's only natural that the concept should be exploited for its comedic value, and ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" is brilliant in this regard.Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine are the title characters, two likable good ol' boys who just want to relax and have a good time at their newly acquired vacation retreat, a run down old rural cabin. Into their lives come some rowdy college kids who get the wrong impression of Tucker & Dale, even more so when one of their own, Allison (Katrina Bowden), has an accident. Tucker & Dale come to her rescue, and the kids, having already formed their opinions of the pair, interpret the event negatively. As a result, they keep launching assaults on poor Tucker & Dale that end badly, with the kids managing to gruesomely kill themselves over and over in the process.""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" is extremely bright, engaging, and knowing comedy taking a delightfully satiric approach to standard genre filmmaking. Granted, by nature of its story, it eventually, understandably turns into the very thing it's making fun of, but it's still very entertaining right from beginning to end. Not only does it make fun of certain stereotypes, but peoples' own preconceived notions, which can well be formed by the weight of so many straight faced movies of this kind. And it even works in a heartfelt message about self-esteem into its mix with real deftness.Written by director Eli Craig and co-producer Morgan Jurgenson, this is high energy filmmaking that's often breathless enough, and compulsively watchable, that one may truly not notice the time passing, it's that enjoyable. What's great is how well Craig and Jurgenson set things up just so they can be misunderstood, such as the incident with the bees. The movie doesn't skimp on the gore, either, but it's always spun in such a funny fashion; as soon as we see that wood chipper, we're primed and ready to see it in action, and when we do, the result is uproarious.Actors Tudyk and Labine, two engaging guys who really ought to see their stars rise after this, are perfect as Tucker & Dale. The lovely Bowden is an immensely appealing actress playing an immensely appealing character, who by the way, is another case of embodying the whole idea of there being more to an individual than meets the eye. And Jesse Moss is a real hoot as the demented frat boy hellbent on going after Tucker & Dale; he's in for a very apt revelation that he couldn't have anticipated.And, in closing, while the whole ""therapy"" session does slow things down a bit, it's quite revelatory itself - how often in this sort of story do we actually see the opponents actually engage in a bit of (hopefully) civil airing of grievances?Craig and his wife Sasha play the cameraman and reporter in the pre-credits sequence.Nine out of 10.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
16,Boba_Fett1138,Good and fun but nothing more than that really.,7,28 September 2011,"This movie has grown out to be a fan favorite and even a bit of a cult classic already. I however was less impressed with it. Yes, it's a good and fun movie but it at the same time is also far from a great or hilarious one.Thing that makes this movie is its originality. It's an horror comedy that is unique with its approach really. The movie plays out like an actual serious horror/slasher, in which a bunch of teenagers end up death, one by one. Only difference is that they are killed due to their own stupidity and prejudices against rednecks. They mistake Tucker & Dale for bloodthirsty serial killers and no matter what Tucker & Dale try to show their friendly nature and good intentions, things only get made worse due to the big misunderstandings between the two different social classes.And this is why I foremost liked this movie. It plays out like a real modern slashers, in which a bunch of teenagers get stuck in the woods somewhere and end up all getting killed off, one by one. It really progresses in the same way as an actual serious slasher and also features all of the clichés and formulaic characters. You could say that ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is a real spoof of the genre and does a good job at it, while also still being original on its own, despite the presence of all of the familiar clichés.This is also where the movie draws all of its comedy from. It makes the movie fun and tongue-in-cheek but I can't really say that the movie ever becomes an hilarious one. The movie is not well enough written for that and it's lacking a certain edge that allows things to go over-the-top more, like for instance a movie like ""Shaun of the Dead"" did all had in it.It's not to sound like a nitpick but it's just so that the movie isn't as good as it potentially could had become and the fan-boys are drooling a bit too much over it right now. But having said that; I obviously still really liked the movie and also thinks it's a bit of shame that the movie isn't more recognized, by a broader audience.It's definitely a skilfully made movie, also especially when you consider its recourses. This was a low-budget and low-key production, also without any real big names involved. I only wished that they didn't used so many CGI for its gore effects. Seriously, stop doing that horror film-makers out there. It's so cheap and fake looking.I really liked it a lot, just didn't loved it as everyone else that watches it seems to do.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

That's what you have with ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil,"" a very funny horror comedy that upends the psychotic-hillbilly motif that's played so straight in so many other movies by having the hillbillies be sweet, lovable guys who don't understand why a bunch of preppy college kids are attacking them.Not only is the movie funny, but it's surprisingly sweet and smart, with two terrific performances at its center and some clever writing throughout that prevents what could have been a one-note joke from imploding.And I'm going to start including ""frat bitch"" as part of my standard vocabulary.Grade: A",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Terrified by the sight of them,Allison faints and falls in.As Tucker & Dale pull Allison out of the river,Allison's friends look on in horror,as Allison is ""kidnapped.""Whilst Dale and Tucker start helping Allison to heal up,her friends start to make plans for their own hillbilly massacre.View on the film:Sitting on the shelf for 3 years,co-writer/(along with Morgan Jurgenson) director Eli Craig and cinematographer David Geddes give the title a remarkably fresh,shining appearance,with stylish light blue smoke giving the woods a blood thirsty Slasher atmosphere. Pilling the timber & the bodies,Craig displays a real sense of glee at the murder scenes,as bright red splashes of blood spill from wood chippers to chainsaws.Whilst the film does lose some steam in the final moments,the screenplay by Craig & Jurgenson slashes the running time by cutting hilariously sharp,gory jokes into the horror,with endless misunderstandings leading to fatal deaths. Placing Dale & Tucker's friendship at the centre of the title,the writers give the duo a surprisingly well warmth,thanks to the deadly mishaps showing to help Tucker & Dale become firmer friends.Joined by a charmingly sexy Katrina Bowden as Allison, Tyler Labine & Alan Tudyk give excellent performances as Tucker and Dale,with Tudyk giving Tucker a dry sense of humour that scatters one liners across the screen,as Labine stomps around in fast pace slap-stick Comedy shots,as Dale & Tucker get ready to face evil.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Funny if slightly overrated horror/comedy,9,23 October 2014,"Heading out to the woods, a group of college kids think the actions of a pair of lonely hillbillies is the work of deranged killers and tries to fend off their attacks to the complete befuddlement of the two guys.While there's a lot to like about this one, there's still a couple of overwhelming flaws here that does hinder this one somewhat. One of the biggest is the fact that this one tends to go overboard in trying to set-up the mistake about what they're doing to the point of total overkill and excess. While a lot of this is due to the completely unrealistic attempts to persuade the others that they're indeed psycho killers based on a back-story that's utterly ridiculous in it's own right, that's still no excuse for the excessive amount of time this one spends trying to hammer home the fact that the kids are wrong and jumping to conclusions about their intentions by utilizing some of the weirdest and most contrived scenarios to backfire at just the right moment to appear otherwise that they're right all along, and eventually this gets a little old as anyone with half a clue about anything makes the continuous mistakes about this. Otherwise, this here is a lot of fun with the fact that as a comedy this tends to get a lot right. The main point about this one is the rather naive business surrounding their good intentioned past that makes for a slew of incredibly hilarious situations here that manage to build quite a healthy backdrop here for the continuous mistakes to come forth. It builds them almost like a farce in the sense of each scenario seemingly fine in their viewpoint yet taken to a darker tone on their side, and the results nearly always hit their mark here with pretty hilarious scenes constantly involved. The darker tone they appropriate to it tends to allow this the sense of some pretty suspenseful moments from time-to-time as there's a lot of rather fine slasher moments here from the encounter at the lake to the first assault on the shack and finally the finale at the abandoned mine which is quite a bit fun with some rather tense moments, a dark revelation that comes to pass and plenty of action to really end this one on a positive note.

Besides being consistently amusing, what works best is that you get to know Tucker and, especially, Dale, as well as the main girl (Katrina Bowden), who's very reminiscent of Christine Taylor (from ""The Brady Bunch Movie""), albeit taller. Freckled cutie Chelan Simmons looks her best clad in daisy dukes throughout.

23,zetes,Hilarious,8,18 September 2011,"A brilliant horror comedy, probably the best of its genre since Shawn of the Dead. It'd probably surpass that film if it didn't stumble pretty badly in its final act, but it's still a ball. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk (of Firefly) are two country boys visiting Tudyk's newly purchased cabin in the woods. Meanwhile, a group of preppy college students take them for psycho hillbillies. When Tucker and Dale save one of the students (Katrina Bowden of 30 Rock fame) from drowning, they take her back to their cabin to recover. Her boyfriend (Jesse Moss) and the other students think that she's been captured and attempt to save her, and generally behave as if they're in a slasher movie. And that's including the cast attrition, as every attempt to exterminate Tucker and Dale leads to the students' grisly demise, one after another. The concept only works to a certain point, and then it attempts to go for some further twists, and they don't generally work. But still, it's amusing even when it's not working, and absolutely hilarious when it is. Labine and Tudyk are both wonderful as the goofy, warm-hearted rednecks who cannot figure out for the life of them why these college students seem to be committing mass suicide around them.

24,trashgang,dumb and dumber go fishing,8,28 October 2011,"I admit, I was afraid to watch this horror/comedy. I'm a horror buff and I can dig comedy too but mostly the combination of both doesn't really work. I had some laughs with the Scary Movie franchise but others like Vampire Suck and Transylmania weren't that laughable. But they came out of the states and their humor isn't my thing. I dig more the British humor like Lesbian Vampire Killers. The director Eli Craig isn't really known for comedies and is more an actor than a director but even then as an actor he isn't really famous in the comedy genre. But what he did here is unbelievable. He even wrote this funny flick himself and directed it. As main leads we have Tyler Labine (Dale) and Alan Tudyk (Tucker) also not known to be funny but they surely know their stuff, Tyler moved on to The Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and Alan came from I Robot. And what an excellent job they both did here as two hillbillies running into trouble just for being hillbillies.I surely would recommend it to the horror fans even as it is a comedy. It do has some gory moments and a lot of red stuff but it's always funny to see how it happened or what is going on. And the jokes are excellent. It's not just funny faces or a fart here or there this is sublime writing and acting falling together. I laughed from almost the beginning until the end. Maybe the last 3 minutes are a bit predictable but what a good time I had watching it. I should even dare to say that maybe this was the funniest horror I have seen so far.

26,StevePulaski,We ain't got the regular here,9,5 September 2011,"I had the pleasure of seeing this on demand using the Xbox Live: Zune Marketplace. Some independent films, that aren't going or are going to very limited theaters, release their films on demand to outlets like Zune, DirecTV, and Pay-Per View to try and get more money before the DVD comes out. I've seen numerous films on Zune like Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, Red State, and many others. It's a very nice privilege to see something you can't in theaters.I praise this new on demand feature because many of the independent films I've seen off of it deserve to have a wide release, but don't get one. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is truly a great, fresh look at comedy/horror as it parodies cabin style horror films like Cabin Fever, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It does it with a good sense of gore and a good sense of humor. Both combinations duplicated a lot in modern horror, but many fail to succeed.The plot: Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Levine) are two backwoods-hillbillies that are as simple as can be. They buy their ""dreamhouse"" in the middle of the woods, which is just a beaten up shack. They are satisfied, and want to fix the house up to fulfill their long time dream.Meanwhile, a group of College kids travel up to the same woods to drink, party, and skinny-dip in a swamp in the middle of the night. Tucker and Dale go swimming late at night when they see a girl, in her bra and underwear, about to jump into swampy water. Because girls love to strip down to nothing in the middle of the woods to go skinny-dipping. Seeing Tucker and Dale surprises her and she falls backwards hitting her head.Tucker and Dale rescue her, and try to alert the group of kids by saying ""We got your friend"" which only achieves scaring the kids and having them run for the hills. The remainder is a series of misunderstandings with the hillbillies looking like serial killers, and the College kids trying to rescue their friend. The misunderstandings aren't very far-fetched, and they almost have a Final Destination appearance to them of people unintentionally dying.Being that this film is sort of the first of its kind, it doesn't have a formula and had to be designed by screenwriters Eli Craig and Morgan Jurgenson. It works. The combinations of gore, humor, and scares are all put into very fair and balanced doses. The film is never cocky, and is always fast-paced and entertaining.Independent horror films will more than likely dominate the growing market. Modern horror films aren't going anywhere but back to the past, and even some former limited release films like Paranormal Activity are being blown out of proportion with sequels and budget-increases. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is as innocent as its title characters - but they continue to deliver edgy laughs and scares.Starring: Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine.

27,Hellmant,Some hillbillies are just like spiders!,9,14 October 2011,"'TUCKER AND DALE VS EVIL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Backwoods hillbillies horror spoof which uses popular B slasher film clichés and gimmicks to turn expectations completely around on the viewer. The look and style of the film is reminiscent to a Bruce Campbell film, or 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' type flick, but it takes the satire one step further by completely reversing all predicted stereotypes. It entertains with tons of horrorhound gore and enormous laughs but it also teaches a valuable lesson at the same time (as cheesy as that sounds). For that I think it deserves a lot of credit. The film is directed and co-written (along with Morgan Jurgenson) by Eli Craig and stars Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk in the title roles. If you're a fan of the genre this is one you definitely don't want to miss! Tudyk plays Tucker and Labine plays Dale, two well intentioned but socially naive hillbillies in West Virginia. They recently bought a cabin in the middle of the woods to go fishing and vacation at. While enjoying their time at the cabin they cross paths with a group of narrow-minded and extremely superficial college kids. Dale immediately begins crushing on one of the girls, named Allison (Katrina Bowden), but feels to shy and awkward to talk to her. When the two accidentally startle her and she falls into the lake, knocking herself out, they decide to take her back to their cabin until she comes to. Her friends mistakenly think she's been kidnapped and immediately jump to the conclusion that Tucker and Dale are psycho killers so they decide to take it upon themselves to rescue her. One misunderstanding leads to another as the college kids begin attacking the shocked hillbillies and continue to accidentally kill themselves in the process, thus furthering their belief that Tucker and Dale are insane killers after them.The movie is packed with big laughs like I said and you do get the gore as well, it's just that it's almost all accidental deaths (played out in very dark comedic ways). The death scenes are almost reminiscent of a 'FINAL DESTINATION' film, just far more satirical. My favorite part of the film though is the way it plays with people's prejudices and stereotypes. It shows that usually the one's that think others are scary or creepy are usually the flawed ones with much bigger problems and the people that are perceived to be 'freaks' are usually much more mentally stable and well intentioned. The classic analogy comparing social misfits to spiders often works which shows that people who are thought to be frightening and or creepy are much more afraid of you than you are of them. There's so much more discrimination and hate crimes going on in the world than most people even begin to realize and it's most often done with out any awareness to it. That's the message of this film, it's played out in an extremely comedic way but the message gets driven home all the same and with a surprising amount of heart. Tudyk and Labine are great in the leads and the directing and script are topnotch as well. This is a film I very much look forward to seeing again and would be equally excited to see some sort of a sequel revisiting the characters. It's definitely horror comedy done right!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-KU7aWFnDI",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
28,cherold,Brilliant idea for a short comedy sketch,5,22 May 2017,"The premise of this movie, in which a couple of helpful hillbillies are mistaken by panicked college kids for serial killers, is absolutely brilliant, and I was very excited when I saw the trailer. But alas, the movie itself wasn't really particularly funny, and after about a third of it I got bored and started skipping through looking for funny bits I never found.Once you've got the idea of this movie it doesn't really have any place to go. People will die in predictable ways and the film will offer up all sorts of genre-appropriate clichés. The most interesting idea involves an attempt at conflict resolution, but once again the execution fails a good idea. My feeling is this movie chose a center ground when it would have been better at one of the extremes. Tucker and Dale don't quite seem like real people, but they aren't that broadly drawn either, and the kids are too generic to be interesting. I think the movie either should have gone full Scary Movie, with the silliness ramped up to 11, or it should have made Tucker and Dale feel like genuine backwoods types caught in a bad situation and explored the way we make assumptions about one another. Of those two choices, I'm inclined to prefer the former, but either would be better than the actual movie.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Two reasons why redneck murderers get away with their crime. The DNA all matches and there are no dental records. Still, Tuck & Dale GITS-ER-DONE!! It's a fun watch! The people from the Appalachian Mountains has always had to dealt with outsiders projected them with negative Appalachian often derogatory stereotypes such as murderers Hillbillies or rapist Rednecks due to horror films such as Deliverance (1972), The Last House on the Left (1972), The Hills Have Eyes (1977), Friday the 13th (1980) & Mother's Day (1980). In these films, a group of city slickers gets lost in the backwoods and are hunted and slaughtered by psychopathic in-bred hillbillies. However, Tucker and Dale turns the table with its plot. Directed by Eli Craig, Tuck (Alan Tudyk) & Dale (Tyler Labine) are not psychopathic hicks, but just normal guys trying to rebuild their summer home, only to have out of town, college kids leaded by Chad (Jesse Moss) mistake them for brutal killers and try to murder them! This movie show a bright light on the misunderstanding between people and how jumping to conclusion about someone, based solely on his or her physical appearance can become deadly. The movie pretty smart with its themes. The jokes are funny. I love all the out-of-context misunderstanding jokes. The movie does spoof a lot of previous horror films like the weapons they use, like the over long scythe from 1977's Eaten Alive and 1982's Unhinged to the chainsaw from 1974's Texas Chain Saw Massacre & 1987's Evil Dead. Even the opening has this The Blair Witch Project (1999) feel with a lost-footage sequence. There is a lot of Sigmund Freud psychoanalysis topics running around throughout the film, ranging from understanding Inferiority vs superior complex, the understanding of dreams, life and death drives and others. The movie does have faults, as it's hard to suspense your disbelief, in particular, all of the silly mishap ways of dispatching the college kids through a series of accidents. Yet, it so surreal absurd that all the improbability doesn't really matter too much, as its funny to watch how the college kids end up dead meat. It's also a bit far fetch for a girl like Allison (Katrina Bowden) to be find herself, falling in love with Dale. Tyler Labine really does come off as ""Larry the Cable Guy,"" type of a guy, as some fans might mistake it for Larry the Cable Guy movie. You also get a lot of inside jokes about Tyler Labine previous acting jobs such as Dale holding a Scythe, which represent his role as Alan Sock from 2007 to 2009, CW TV Series; 'Reaper'. I'm quite pleased to say all the actors play their parts well and are easily likable. Still, the movie kinda spoil the fact that Jesse Ross comes across, the villain; way too early in the film. I would rather have a slow build to that. Even the whole backstory of Jesse Ross seem a bit rushed. There is no reason for the closure that he got. Even the trailer, steal almost all of the best jokes and lines from the film. It even feature most of the deaths. So, I wouldn't advice, watching the trailer for this film if you haven't saw it. The gore and violence in the film is graphic, all done in a comedic matter. There is one scene of nudity, but it's in poor light and from some distance. It's a bit disappointing. The music choice for the film, kinda sucks with the teen rock type music. It felt quite out of place as well. I'm sure it cleared the theater very quickly when it came out. After that, there's a much more fitting country song. The DVD version is pretty good copy. The DVD likewise contains a 15-minute bonus feature called Tucker and Dale ARE Evil, which re-edit version of the film, told from the story from the college kids' point of view that makes Tucker and Dale look like they killed everybody.

The film even begins, as one would expect, with the college kids in focus, scared out of their wits as the two hillbillies stare at them as they briefly drive by. Soon afterwards though, we are treated to the hillbillies' perspective and they remain empathetic throughout, especially as dead bodies pile up around them, completely oblivious to the fact that the college students think that they are serial killers. The fun diminishes somewhat as the pair realise that the college kids have a vendetta against them, but even so, the film remains interesting to watch as the brats essentially create their own downfalls, with their paranoia and instinctive distrust leading to their demise. Occasionally the film falls into cliché, but there is something deliciously postmodern to the way the film daringly swims against genre expectations. The movie also manages to address some issues revolving around confidence and misunderstandings based on unfair assumptions and the title characters are fleshed out in incredible depth for such a short (under 90 minute) feature with both Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine great in the roles.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
34,tomgillespie2002,Balances disturbing and macabre sequences with charm and tenderness,6,6 October 2011,"The perils of the American deep south has been highlighted rather stereotypically in the horror genre since the times of Deliverance, The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre, or The Hills Have Eyes. In these (now classic) films, the slack-jawed ""redneck"" is dumb, feral, inbred, and particularly cannibalistic. But what about the innocuous, middle- American teens that infest the beautiful surroundings that these yokels occupy? Aren't these people inherently evil? This is the premise of this silly, sometimes gory, but affectionate and charming horror/comedy.We are first introduced to the typical slasher film set of teens on summer break (or whatever!), that have ventured into the back-of-beyond to camp in the woods. They stop at a gas station to pick up some beers. Whilst there the camera losses interest in these and cuts to Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine), two ""rednecks"" off to their vacation home in the woods. Dale, who is hapless in the face of the opposite sex, has spotted one of the group Allison (Katrina Bowden), who he has taken a fancy to. Tucker advises that he should go talk to her. Dale approaches the group carrying a scythe, and blunders through some broken sentences. Having concluded that Dale is an evil redneck of the Slasher genre, they speed off. This scene sets the tone for the film.Whilst fishing Tucker and Dale are unwittingly involved in Allison begin knocked out after falling into the lake, and they rescue her and tack her back to their shack. Basically all those genre tropes are deconstructed, and turned on their heads. The visiting teens start to attack Tucker and Dale, whilst Allison learns not to judge a book by its cover. This is the fundamentally basic theme of the film. The teens end up killing themselves in a series of accidents, that could easily be seen as acts of ferocious violence.This is not the greatest film of it's kind, but it absolutely delivers on some funny, disturbing and macabre sequences. It balances this with a great charm and tenderness to its subject and characters. And the simple question of who is the monster of society is highlighted slightly: the monsters are those nasty, rich frat-boy pigs of the American college system (or perhaps in Brett Easton Ellis's world, a member of the Bateman clan).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Finally, a clever satire on horror conventions",7,27 January 2012,"Horror movies live and die by conventions. No genre more willingly rehashes tropes and archetypes, or even entire plots. Perhaps horror fans are so exhilarated by the first-time use of an effective original horror film device they are wont to indulge it numerous times until filmmakers have tapped out every possible riff on said device.This makes horror ripe for satire, yet prior to ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil,"" only the ""Scary Movie"" franchise has tried to exploit it for humorous purposes. Even then, rather than clever, nuanced jabs, the ""Scary Movie"" series goes more over-the-top, inflating any scraps of satire with off-topic pop culture references. It's a bit confounding to be honest, how the horror genre finally has found something that is both homage to horror/comedy and subtly self- deprecating.""Tucker & Dale"" works off the basic premise of a miscommunication based on horror stereotypes: a group of college kids on their way to vacation in some remote woods meet our titular fellas—a pair of honest-to-goodness rednecks—at a rest stop, and take them for a pair of crazies.Well, Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) happen to be on a much-needed vacation at a cabin in the woods. One night out fishing the kids are skinny-dipping and one girl, Allison (Katrina Bowden), sees them and accidentally falls off a rock and unconscious. Her friends mistake Dale's attempt to rescue Allison for an abduction and plot a way to get their friend back.A farce ensues that sees the kids misinterpreting what Tucker and Dale are doing around the cabin as prepping to kill Allison, yet in their attempts to foil them, end up killing each other and consequently fueling their own illusion. Meanwhile, Tucker and Dale start to wonder if they're caught in the middle of a suicide pact. Eventually things become less predictable when the college kid Chad (Jesse Moss) starts taking the revenge game too seriously.Writer/director Eli Craig and spends time acquainting us with Tucker and Dale to the point that we get a nice subplot going with their relationship, but also to make the college kids seems all the more stupid. We laugh at these characters in horror films because they're stupid, but ""Tucker & Dale"" does it with more self-awareness; Craig knows how ridiculous these characters tend to be in horror films too.Tudyk gives his usual grade-A character actor performance, but Labine generates the adoration for this film with his lovably dumb teddy bear routine. He's a character we've seen before in comedy, but he does it with such an honest innocence.""Tucker & Dale"" delivers a handful of predictable moments, but there's a satisfaction in seeing them coming that you don't get in most films, simply because you want it to happen. That's part of the draw with horror films, but the enjoyment for this movie comes in the comedic sense. In terms of satire, you know exactly what Craig is going for and it makes too much sense to not be able to appreciate it.The movie does veer a bit toward the end from its satirical foundation, but by this point the characters have earned enough favor that the story plays out well enough. A more effective horror/comedy twist, however, would have been a nice addition. Craig doesn't manage to take any jabs at horror that seem uniquely genius or insightful, but ""Tucker & Dale"" is also meant to be a product of love for the genre too, not a complete berating. Those who love the silly thrills of horror will likely appreciate ""Tucker & Dale's"" self-aware perspective, and those who love to laugh at the genre will have even more cause to do so.~Steven CThanks for reading!

38,Vartiainen,Plays its markers a bit too early,6,29 January 2020,"Tucker and Dale vs Evil has a great premise. What if those crazy backwoods hillbillies - who are probably cannibals - you see in every other horror movie were actually the victims of the film? Now that's pure gold right there.And the early scenes of this film have some really great jokes, stemming from that initial idea. There's an especially great scene involving a chainsaw and a wasp nest, which caused me to crack myself up. If this film could have kept up such quality throughout its entire run-time, we would be talking about a new horror comedy cult classic.Unfortunately all the best jokes are in the initial half of the film. The second half loses a lot of its humour - although it makes up for it a little bit with surprising amounts of heartwarming - and becomes a more straightforward horror slasher film.Not helping the matters is the actual villain of the movie, who's so over the top psycho that it doesn't make any sense that he would be able to function in a normal society. This is a dude who would stand in the corner of a party, openly licking a knife, cackling while he does it. How are these other people friends with him? Sure, it's supposed to be a joke how over the top he is, but it just doesn't make any sense. The film would have worked fine without his psychosis. Just let it be a movie about a huge, colossal misunderstanding. Like the first half of the film.Still, the film has passion and charm behind it. Some of the jokes are really good, as are somewhat surprisingly some of the characters. The villain is terrible, but who knows, you might like how bat guano bonkers he is.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

41,freemantle_uk,A funny horror parody,8,19 January 2013,"Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a horror-comedy that quickly developing a cult following and there is good reason as it takes on and subvert the clichés of the slasher genre and twists them into something new.Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are two hillibillies who have just brought a vacation home in the mountains of West Virginia and go there to fix it up, despite not seeing the strange iconography in the house. A group of college kids also go to the mountains to go camp and they imminently distrust the hillibiillies and through a series of misunderstanding think they are slasher killers, especially after they save one of them, Ally (Katrina Bowden). Most of the students want to go to the police, but their Chad (Jesse Moss) has a deep-seeded hatred towards hilibillies and wants to go war with the pair.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil two main jokes, it is a series of misunderstanding and role reverses: but it does both of them very well. It is clear the filmmakers have a lot of knowledge of the horror genre and wanted to parody the genre. The role reversal was very well handled, that it was the college kid that was psycho-killer and the hillibillies are the protagonists. Tucker and Dale are made out to be likable guys and the college kids are actually aware of the situation and want to do the logical thing: go away and get the police but are led array by someone with serious psychological issues.There are many different types of humour through the film. Besides from the satire and parody of the horror genre there is also plenty of violence slapstick as people start dying in very fun ways and there were also a lot of good dialogue and verbal jokes (my personal favourite involved a gun).Tudyk and Labine have shown themselves to be capable actors in previous roles and they had great chemistry together. They did feel like there were friends for years and were likable enough presence on screen. Bowden and Moss were decent enough in their roles, but the rest of the college kids were bad: my theory was that it was deliberate so that the film can play on the fact slashers have bad actors but the teens in this film act more realistically.At 86 minutes the running time is very short, even for a horror film. Director Eli Craig does a great job at moving the film forward, making sure there is no fat and keeps a scene of fun throughout, even when the film is not being a horror or comedy film, i.e. the final climax.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a fun film as a comedy but truly shines as a parody of the horror/slasher genre. Horror fans and people with a slightly darker sense but there is plenty for people to enjoy because of the comedy.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It's shallow - no, really shallow - but so are the slasher flicks it's sending up, so par for the course I guess. Problem is, Cabin in the Woods is already more comprehensive, Scream is wittier and Scary Movie is more profane, so there's not a lot of room to find a fresh niche. The titular duo have a good thing going, and the core script-flip of teens doing the terrorizing is fun in concept. There's just so little to it beyond the bare bones that it's hardly a filling meal, so the good laughs and splatter effects can't find enough meat to sink their teeth in.

There is a macabre majesty in how unfortunate circumstances turn a group of people that otherwise would have no inclination to harm a fly against each other in class fueled sectarian carnage.Don't think this is just a horror parody or some sort of comedic pastiche of horror like Shaun of the Dead or The Scouts guide to zombies or Zombeavers, this is the real deal. The comic tone only intensifies the brutality in a movie about prejudice without being sanctimonious and with a genuine heart at its core.My only issues with this movie are that line ""I worked on a farm, it was either work or get out"" which rubbed me the wrong way for some reason and how they don't give enough character flaws to the more rural characters beyond maybe some lacking people skills.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine steal the show as the titular characters Tucker and Dale, and both play their impressively silly dialogue with such ease that hasn't been seen in a comedy in quite some time. The film is paced surprisingly well, and though the humor is a few times more easy to cringe at than earn a laugh, it is still in good fun and provides nostalgia for when this type of comedy earned its roots. The script is wildly original for a comedy, concidering most nowadays are remakes, sequels, or are simply unfunny and bland. It bears on familiar themes, such as slapstick and underdog like scenarios, but it reaches different places with them and provides for one of the more easily entertaining comedies in quite some time.

51,s3276169,Mildly Amusing Comedy of Errors Horror,6,6 January 2015,"Dale and Tucker is a comedy of errors that see's two harmless hillbilly's mistaken for Deliverance style serial killers by a group of vacuous college students on vacation.Its a rather interesting premise that gradually unfolds as various innocent and often benevolent actions taken by the hillbilly's are misinterpreted by the college kids. The misunderstandings build and then escalate infecting both sides, who come to believe, for different reasons, that the other group is out to get them. The result, predictably, is mayhem. The humour is of the physical kind. Set piece scenarios that lead to bloody, gruesome, if accidental deaths that intentionally pay homage to gruesome murders found in serious horror flicks. Its not terribly believable but its not supposed to be, its slapstick and proud of it. Dale and Tucker tries to emulate films such as Home Alone but with sharp teeth. This film however only ever aspires to the humor found in flicks like Home Alone. Its no where near as creative or clever in its use of slapstick violence. As a result the mounting deaths start to become rather repetitious, unnecessarily bloody and a little dull. That said Tucker and Dale isn't dreadful. Its a nice idea that would have shone with sharper execution (pardon the pun). The key hillbilly leads are very likable and carry their roles convincingly. The students suitably snooty and foolish.

53,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Horror/Comedy That Plays with Troupes,9,15 December 2019,"This film was one that I blinded checked out while I was working at Family Video. At that time I would randomly take home films that were coming out to see if I could find diamonds in the rough. I know after that first viewing I enjoyed it, but then the more I heard about it, the more I wanted to give it a second viewing. I checked this out at the time with my girlfriend during October as I thought it would be a fun film as she's still fairly new to the genre. There has now been a third viewing for the Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2010s. The synopsis is affable hillbillies Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are on vacation at their dilapidated cabin when they're mistaken for murderers by a group of preppy college students.We begin with a film crew going into a building. We learn that it is an active crime scene and the cameraman is scared. The reporter mocks him, but then they're attacked by someone with half of their face burned. We then cut to the past to see what led us here.We follow a group of college students as they head for the wilderness of West Virginia for a camping trip. The guys are all in a fraternity together and led by Chad (Jesse Moss). The problem with him is that he thinks he's better than everyone. His girlfriend is there, Allison (Katrina Bowden). His frat brothers along are Jason (Brandon Jay McLaren), Chuck (Travis Nelson), Todd (Alex Arsenault) and Mitch (Adam Beauchesne). Also along are Naomi (Christie Laing) and Chloe (Chelan Simmons).On their drive, they almost collide with a truck that belongs to two rednecks with the driver being Dale and the heavier one is Tucker. We see that they are actually fairly intelligent and actually Tucker is kind of genius because he remembers everything he hears. They're on their way to a cabin they just purchased as their vacation home.Both groups meet up at the store and the college kids think these two country folk are creepy. Tucker falls for Allison immediately as she's the most beautiful girl he's ever seen. He tries to talk to her, but fumbles over his words. This infuriates Chad who goes off and they leave. The Sheriff (Philip Granger) pulls over the duo and he doesn't like the looks of the two. He tells them they should go back home.Chad actually hates rednecks and tells the group the story of a massacre that occurred where they are in the past. Tucker and Dale arrive at their cabin and go about fixing it up. That night they go fishing in the same lake the college students go skinny dipping. The two see them and spook Allison. This causes her to fall off a rock and she hits her head, knocking her out. The rest of her group sees them taking her and think they're kidnapping the unconscious woman.They then attempt to save her, but they're quite unlucky and start to kill themselves in some pretty crazy ways. Chad and the surviving members though think it is Tucker and Dale killing them. They want revenge and to save Allison. It appears though there's more to this story than what Chad shared, plus there's a side to it that he has no idea about either.Now if you've read reviews I've wrote in the past, you know that I'm not always the biggest fan of horror comedies. Looking back on what I originally wrote, I've definitely changed quite a bit, because I really like this one actually. It has such an interesting concept and how things play out is great.Something that I want to point out is the changing of roles here. Chad and the frat brothers think they're better because they're in college and they just have that 'bro' feel to them. That's not new. What is interesting though is that Tucker is actually a genius and both he and Dale are really nice guys. They're not actually trying to hurt them, which you don't normally see in films like this. The movie really is playing on the hixploitation sub-genre. It is also funny that Allison is going to school to be a therapist because she feels like a lot of problems are caused by a lack of communication, which is exactly what is happening here. This definitely adds to comedy.I want to shift to the effects next so I can talk about the deaths. Some of them are hilarious to me and just how seeing things from both sides, you can understand why there's fear. If either side would just communicate, a lot of things could be avoided. This includes falling into a wood chipper or impaling themselves on a spear. The thing is, I know there's CGI here, but it is blended so well with the practical effects. It definitely looks real and the film is shot in way that definitely helps for sure.Moving next the pacing, this movie has a runtime of 89 minutes and it is perfect. We get that cold open to this before shifting to meeting our characters. It doesn't waste any time to show to show that the college kids fear and hate the rednecks, even though there's no reason to. It is playing with stereotypes and I'm sure movies like Deliverance. People start to die afterwards and the comedy is throughout. Something interesting though is that the comedy really doesn't hurt this film for me. I think because Chad is so evil, it really makes you wonder if the heroes will be able to defeat him. The irony is that he thinks Tucker and Dale are the ones who are pure evil. The ending also works for me, even though it is a bit sappy. I still like it though.As for the acting, I actually think it is great. I became a fan of Labine after this one and would watch most everything he was in because of it. He's an awkward, big, lovable teddy bear around Allison and it's adorable. Tudyk is solid in his performance. He's just a solid actor. I fell in love with Bowden after seeing here her. She's beautiful and her performance was solid. Moss does really well at being a jerk as well. It grows into straight evil the more we learn about him which works. I thought the rest of the cast rounded this film out for what was needed. It was also fun seeing Simmons who has done a few movies in the genre.Now with that said, I liked this the first time I saw and I like it even more after this second viewing. Being that this is comedy, it still actually works as a horror film. There's an interesting concept that we see played out in films like Wrong Turn or Deliverance and playing with the troupes. The acting is really good across the board and I think the pacing is solid as well. The effects were good with a blend of CGI and practical. The soundtrack really didn't stand out to me. It does fit for what is needed though. If you're looking for a horror comedy, this is definitely on my short list of recommendations. Overall I'd say this is a good movie for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

The narrative focus leaves this group of clichéd teens and joins a hillbilly duo. These aren't some inbred, stupid, weirdos. Tucker and Dale are smart, loyal, and play off each other with the kind of comrade usually reserved for buddy cop action films. They genuinely care for each other. As events unfold a series of comical misunderstandings leave the teenagers thinking that Dale and Tucker are out to kill them. As they begin to protect themselves, they inadvertently start offing themselves. The film is hilarious in its presentation of these antics, and Dale and Tucker's reactions are simply priceless. We are also treated to a sweet blossoming love story. If the film is guilty of one thing, it's that it pushes its premise too far and it runs out of steam towards the end.

58,brando647,Best Horror Parody Since SHAUN OF THE DEAD,9,15 January 2012,"Good things come to those who wait, and I've waited for this movie for long enough. I'd wanted to see this movie from the first time I stumbled across the synopsis and learned that Alan Tudyk would be playing one of the title characters. Instant win. I knew there was little chance that this movie would be anything but awesome, and I was proved right when it was released at long last on home video (since I wasn't lucky enough to live in one of the few cities blessed with it's limited release). It's a new spin on the classic horror movie cliché of the deranged hillbillies terrorizing innocent victims in the woods. In this case, Tucker and Dale are a couple of good ol' boys heading out to the West Virginia wilderness to renovate Tucker's new vacation home/cabin in the woods. A handful of college students have also decided to make use of the backwoods for a camping trip, where they mistake the pair of bumbling rednecks as psycho killers. The misunderstanding leads to a series of unfortunate events where the college kids begin accidentally dying off in gruesome fashion, only solidifying their fear in the harmless hillbillies. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is equal parts comedy and horror movie in a perfect balance of the two genres from director Eli Craig (who hasn't really got much else under his belt, directing-wise). This movie is guaranteed to achieve cult status once word gets around about how awesome this movie is.It's such a simple idea that I'm really surprised it hasn't been done before. It's just a simple 180º twist on the sort of horror we've seen in Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or THE HILLS HAVE EYES. Tucker and Dale are a couple of simpletons played to perfection by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine. They really just want to enjoy a simple vacation of fishing and renovations when the posse of judgmental college kids led by Chad (with his own dark side) arrive and fudge it all up. Alan Tudyk is awesome in pretty much anything I've seen him in. I honestly can't think of a single instance where his character was a weak spot in any film or TV show. He's given the spotlight as one of the title characters for once, and he makes an excellent redneck. Tucker is the more levelheaded, headstrong leader of the duo who's not really interested in the new arrivals and wishes they'd just have kept to themselves. Dale (Labine) is the socially inept doofus who develops a crush on beautiful Allison after rescuing her from a near drowning and essentially setting off the chain of bloody events. He steps into the hero role as he gradually comes out shell to Allison and stands up against Chad and his crew. Katrina Bowden fulfills her basic obligations as the blossoming love interest Allison, a beautiful girl with a hot cheerleader vibe and a heart of gold who's willing to overlook Tucker and Dale's social status. Of the remaining college crew, the only standout is of course Jesse Moss as Chad. The kid is demented and reeks of cheese, but his campiness suits the tone of the movie so you can't complain.In my opinion, this is the best horror movie parody since Edgar Wright's SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It succeeds in all the aspects of a good comedy/horror movie that the SCARY MOVIE franchise (primarily any the sequels) fails at. The jokes in the movie are hilarious, thanks for Tudyk and Labine. And the kills in the movie can be just as gruesome as any mainstream horror film; I'd give examples but, as with any horror/slasher movie, I don't really want to spoil any potential kills. Everything in this movie works great with the exception of the third act. After the characters leave the main cabin in the woods location and arrive at the final conflict in a saw mill, it loses some steam. Maybe because it drops the horror parody vibe I'd been enjoying for the previous hour, but the whole end confrontation felt like a misstep. It doesn't exactly ruin the movie, it just didn't feel like it fit for me. As a whole, I really loved this movie and I expect it'll garner a pretty nice following on DVD/Blu-ray. The filmmakers have done an awesome job here and all I ask is that they enjoy the movie's success without tarnishing its awesomeness with an unnecessary sequel. I don't want to see more TUCKER AND DALE hijinks; their battle with evil was cool enough on it's own.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

60,Screen_Blitz,"Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a wildly funny mix of blood, gore, and a surprising amount of heart",8,1 August 2017,"Spending the weekend at the lake camping, drinking, and skinning dipping in the lake, what could possibly go wrong? A lot, unfortunately, as demonstrated in many horror entities such as 'Friday the 13th' and 'Cabin Fever'. When tackling on the horror genre, it seems that the lake house or a cabin in the woods is never a safe place of teenagers, young adults, or even grown man party at. This horror-comedy hybrid sets another example, only with a slightly smarter and heartfelt approach. You ever heard the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover""? Well, this gore-filled comedy takes the inspiring concept and turns it right on his head with this genre- bending farce showcasing a hilarious conflict between a group of college kids and a duo of bearded country men who are just out for a weekend of fishing. Whereas the former are typically the good guys and the latter are usually the bad guys, this film makes a daring task to take that clichéd and gives it a twist. This movie follows a group of college students who drive out to the country and spend their weekend at the lake, the same lake country hillbillies Tucker (played by Alan Dudyk) and Dale (played by Tyler Labine) happen to be camping at. Upon meeting them at a gas station, the gang immediately comes creeped out by them and flees. Later that night, at the lake, one of the girls Allison (played by Katrina Bowden) suffers a head injury and falls into the water. When Tucker and Dale drag her to their cabin to nurse her, her friends grow incredible suspicious (and judgemental) and wage war on the hillbillies. What ensues instead is a comical, but deadly turn for the worst. In today's age, too many people are top quick to judge for the appearance of others. The issue lies within the core of the plot here, which offers an absurd, yet hilarious testament on the consequences of misjudging others for what is seen on the outside than what is on the inside. And director Eli Craig is the mastermind behind reeling in this inspiring phenomenon with a funny, tongue-in- cheek twist. The movie follows a familiar cliché with a young college age kids battling against some middle-aged country boys who they believe are just your average psychopaths hungry for blood, only both sides of the moral compass are swapped between the two groups. The film introduces the two eponymous characters as stereotypical southerners with big beards and lightly sets up their background, while leaving most of the college characters rendered in simple figures. From there on, it is not long before the story escalates into a gut-busting bloodbath, and that is where most of the laughs are perpetrated. When tension between the two sides rise, so does the body count, not because these kids make the stupid decisions known in slasher movies but simply because they are just too amateur to defend themselves without being overly clumsy. Like films such as 'Shaun of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', the film uproots its goofy humor through an excess of blood and gore to showcase the violent, albeit hilarious deaths of the characters. And to fuel up the intellect tank, there is a smart message about thinking before you judge others upon first glance and learning to stand up for yourself, both of which are nicely offered in the midst of the carnage and laughter. Eli Craig proves he knows how to give a film a strong heart without neglecting his duty for reel in some good laughs. Not many comedies, particularly the ones mating with the horror genre, accomplish that feat. Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a wildly funny mix of blood, gore, and surprising amount of heart in the midst of its outrageous gruesome hilarity. It is a funny good time that proves movies can be uproot plenty of laughter through stupidity while flourishing an intellectual touch to the mix. Comedy fans will be satisfied, while gore lovers will be ecstatic.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

65,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An amusing examination of the ridiculous nature of horror films.,6,8 March 2019,"I'm not really a fan of the horror genre. Mostly, I feel the plots are contrived, the characters are downright idiotic, and the violence is over-the-top. Of course, when I heard about Tucker and Dale vs. Evil years ago, I said, ""pass."" The friend who suggested I see it assured me that it wasn't like all the other horror films. The fact is, it is exactly like all the other horror films, but it is self-aware of this fact. Because the film is self-aware, it recognizes every single horror genre trope and makes fun of it.As time went by, more people suggested I see this film, so I finally caved during a slow weekend at home. Being the self-aware film that it is, the plot is simple and the production values are limited, at best. What really makes the film enjoyable to watch is the fact that the whole premise is practically a ""comedy of errors."" Lack of communication just adds to the hilarity as a bunch of cliché college students find themselves killed off one-by-one by their own bad luck. If I were to compare this to another, well-known horror franchise, this film has the setting of The Evil Dead (1981) with the comedy of Army of Darkness (1992).Unfortunately, because it holds to the tropes of the horror genre, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil doesn't have much to offer other than a funny commentary on the horror genre as a whole. The independent nature of the project and limited budget really show through, even if the comedy is spot on. The main characters of Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are worth the watch, regardless.An amusing examination of the ridiculous nature of horror films, I give Tucker and Dale vs. Evil 3.0 stars out of 5.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It's shallow - no, really shallow - but so are the slasher flicks it's sending up, so par for the course I guess. Problem is, Cabin in the Woods is already more comprehensive, Scream is wittier and Scary Movie is more profane, so there's not a lot of room to find a fresh niche. The titular duo have a good thing going, and the core script-flip of teens doing the terrorizing is fun in concept. There's just so little to it beyond the bare bones that it's hardly a filling meal, so the good laughs and splatter effects can't find enough meat to sink their teeth in.

You can sit through it and thoroughly enjoy the scenarios, one-liners, and twists. In a way, it's a good example of a balance of concept/writing and production: With some flicks, the writing is so good that you can forgive lousy production. Not so, here: The premise and scenarios were good, but it was still necessary to feel that ""labor of love"" in the production; and you got it.Anyway, don't be afraid to rent it and have at it, of an evening.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Many accidents following adding to their belief but actually it's not so.Very funny in places and a total blast from start to finish especially the wood chopper!One to sit down with a drink of your choice and just laugh at the sheer stupidity of the college students and how things can be miss understood when simply judging on someone's appearance or how they speak.Rating 10 out of 10",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

71,mario_c,"""Hillbillies"" vs. ""College Kids"": Let the battle begin!",10,28 March 2012,"What a hilarious film! I don't remember to laugh so much for a long time! TUCKER&DALE VS.EVIL is an amazing horror comedy that completely messes up with all clichés of the average horror film. I mean, the typical formula of ""group of college kids + woods + cabin in the woods + one or two hillbillies = horror film"" is totally messed up in this film, but in a very intelligent and funny way.Through the entire film we see both sides, ""the hillbillies"", TUCKER and DALE, and ""the college kids"" and that's what make it funnier, because we see how they are both mistaken about each other (""college kids"" think TUCKER and DALE are two homicidal freaks and they think the same about the kids when in fact nobody is a psycho killer well, nobody, except one But I won't spoil that). It's in this mood of bad misunderstandings and incredible (I would say hilariously absurd!) accidents that will occur the first deaths of college kids, and increase even more the animosity between them. Only ALLISON, a girl that was saved by the hillbillies from one of those accidents, will understand they're all mistaken, but it's too late and she can't do anything to stop the killing rush It's really an awesome comedy with a very good argument (and script) making fun of horror films (mostly the ones in the same genre of Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE), but as told, in a very humorous and intelligent way. The comical scenes are always based in the weird accidents and also in the DALE's character which is very naïf and insecure. All the characters are well built and are important to the plot.Beside all the fun and the jokes this movie also has two ""serious messages"", both related to DALE's character: 1- You should never judge anyone by his/her appearance. 2- We should always believe in ourselves and fight for what we want. That is the ""serious part"" of the film but for me what is really great in this movie is its humor.So, if you want a good laugh and see some gore too (it also has some nice blood scenes) you got to give it a try. I bet you won't be disappointed! (After watch the trailer my expectation about this movie was high but it was absolutely fulfilled). I score it 10/10.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

74,Superunknovvn,Excellent horror/comedy with an emphasis on comedy,7,27 September 2010,"I saw ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" at the new Viennese /slash Filmfestival that is dedicated to all things horror, sci-fi and fantasy. I walked into the movie knowing nothing about it, having read no reviews and thus not expecting too much. What followed completely took me by surprise.The movie plays on the clichéd plot of a group of college kids going camping in the woods and then being killed off one by one by deranged hillbillies - only this time the hillbillies are completely innocent, good-natured people and all the bloody killings that ensue are just unlucky accidents.What sounds like an amusing idea that's most likely to become a joke that well-overstays its welcome for 90 minutes, was turned into an uplifting movie that's genuinely funny from the first minute to the last. Mostly, that's thanks to the great cast: From the wonderful team of Tyler Labine (Dale) and Alan Tudyk (Tucker) all the way to the hero-turned-villain played Jesse Moss these actors have a great chemistry together and perfect comedic timing. The jokes are silly, but never primitive, the splatter is right on time and funny. (Just do yourself a favor and don't spoil it for yourself by watching the trailer.) What's best of all is that this isn't just a parody of any particular horror movie, but a standalone comedy that works without the usual nods and homages to well-known classic.I really hope ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" will get the exposure it deserves in the coming months.

Really entertaining twist on 'teens in the woods' horror flicks. Lots of laughs and buckets of blood. The actors playing Tucker and Dale are very compelling and believable. Their charm really makes the film and you care about their story.The movie is basically a farce or a comedy of errors with each error resulting in a gruesome death. While the manner of the deaths is so over the top as to be funny, the biggest laughs come from the dialog.

78,CANpatbuck3664,Really Funny and Surprisingly Tender for an R-Rated Horror/Comedy,9,3 November 2017,"Tucker and Dale is so good in many different ways but the first and most noticeable is the very believable friendship between the characters. The movie is deliberately playing into the stereotype that the backwood hillbillies are always the villains and it makes the movie smarter than your average horror movie. But I couldn't help but be taken aback by how sweet Tucker and Dale's bond is. They aren't the sharpest tools in the shed (especially Dale) but you would swear Tudyk and Labine had been hanging out for years. Add in the fact that Allison is well rounded and willing to look past Dale and Tucker's appearance (even to the point where it's a tad unrealistic) and you have some genuinely fun and interesting characterization. Hitting the mark on this aspect will paper over some of the movie's flaws and this part is so exemplary, you would swear this was written by Edgar Wright (Labine/Tudyk reminded me of Pegg and Frost in the best possible way).Of course, if the actors and actresses hadn't held up their end, the writing wouldn't be as evident. I can't credit Tudyk and Labine enough, they both completely sell out as their characters and they both perform admirably. They work well together, and they work well individually, and they had me rolling I was laughing so hard. Katrina Bowden is also great as Allison. She's gorgeous but she's also funny in her own right. She helps sell an unrealistic romance that could have been groan inducing. The other actors and actresses get the job done in their respective parts.Lest you think this is a straight comedy, Tucker and Dale vs Evil packs all the gore you want in a hard R-Rated horror movie. Tucker and Dale aren't directly responsible for the horrible fates that the ""college kids"" all suffer and each of them are maimed or killed in a unique and funny way. Limbs are lost, buckets of blood are sprayed, and one character is even halved (I won't spoil how). If you're a little squeamish, this movie isn't on the level of torture porn but its far from PG-13 material (there are good PG-13 horror movies, but you must go one direction or the other, Tucker and Dale vs Evil isn't one that's up in the air).Most importantly for a horror/comedy, this movie is hilarious from start to finish. Craig and Jurgenson are smart enough writers to know which horror clichés to play with and the movie is packed full of winks and nods to where horror movies usually go. I always appreciate a movie that can effectively include meta humour and this is one of the sharper examples. The material becomes even funnier with the endearing sweetness in the delivery from the cast.The missteps in this movie are small and completely forgivable. Chad becomes a little too over-the-top by the end and although what they decide to do with his character is interesting, it stretches plausibility. I don't know if its how the character is written or Jesse Mosses performance. Some of the kills are better than others but there aren't any that are embarrassingly bad.The cult following this movie has garnered is well deserved. I got shades of Wright/Pegg/Frost from this but this movie stands on its own and deserved to be seen by a wider audience. I would love to see a sequel to this if the could retain the key pieces and find some new things to point fun at. If you're thinking about checking this out, I would recommend you do so.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
79,asda-man,If you go down to the woods today be sure for a big surprise!,8,11 September 2014,"If truth be told, I didn't think that I was going to like Tucker & Dale Vs Evil. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that it looked like a dumb and forced horror comedy in the vein of Scary Movie. However, I had heard a lot of positive reviews so I thought that I'd give it a go. The opening was a little lame and then we get introduced to some truly horrendous characters who are obviously played for laughs. I was beginning to lose faith, right up until Tucker and Dale were introduced.For some reason I thought that the film was about two dumb redneck psychopaths killing some teens. However, what makes the film so clever, unique and funny is that it's not about that at all. Instead it's about two lovable rednecks who get themselves into a lot of farcical situations by mistake. You could hardly call it a slasher film. It's more like a horror romcom with a feel good ending to die for.I laughed throughout Tucker and Dale. It reminded me of Hatchet, only this is far better and funnier, and I really like Hatchet for the record! I watched this on my own and found myself laughing out loud and quite hard too! It reminded me of Miranda sometimes in how everything builds from one misunderstanding to another. The plot is really stupid, but the film knows that and it plays with it in a very clever way offering plenty of sly nods to horror fans who are all too familiar with these types of plots.What makes the film though is it's brilliant characters. You can't help but fall in love with Dale who's so kind and self-depreciating. He's completely different to Tucker who's louder and more amoral, but this makes their relationship that much sweeter. I also loved Allison, the slasher character who normally stays as the drop-dead-gorgeous girl at the back and gets killed quite early on, who turns out to be a sweet and very likable main girl. The rest of the college kids are disposable but purposefully so, apart from the hugely dislikeable psychopath, Chad.Most of all though Tucker and Dale is just bloody good fun to watch. It's a great film to watch with some friends round. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it does take itself seriously enough to give us an endlessly witty and intelligent screenplay, lovable characters and just an all-round good quality film. Some scenes are also really heartfelt which I wasn't expecting. I also loved the infectiously feel good ending which left me grinning ear to ear. This film was such a wonderful surprise to me. I was really expecting to dislike it, but now it's probably one of my favourite horror-comedies. Give it a chance.

81,Rickting,A horrifically funny horror comedy,8,18 December 2014,"It's not all about The Cabin In The Woods. 2 years previously, this under-appreciated horror comedy with what might be an even smarter premise came out and it deserves just as much attention. Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil centres on 2 red necks who a group of teens assume are murderers. When they rescue one of them, the teenagers think they're villains and then when the teens start trying to attack them they keep having accidents and a series of horribly unfortunate misunderstandings occur. This time, the victims are the villains. It's such a clever idea it's surprising no-one attempted it before. It feels a little slight, so this reduces its impact since in terms of scale it's a pretty small movie. Also, it's ludicrous and can repeat itself a bit too much, but don't let that put you off. On Netflix UK's awful horror film selection, there thankfully is a genuinely good horror film aside from Carrie and one or 2 other things. TADVE is great fun for horror fans, and certainly a lot more fun than watching many horror films.The film offers plenty of goofy, gory thrills and can be suspenseful, although always in a light hearted way. Despite the endlessly relaxed tone there are plenty of moderately scary moments. It's also incredibly funny, and the laughs don't really stop flowing even if certain jokes are reused more than they should be. It's original and highly clever, and while it's a film that relies on coincidences, it's so much fun you just don't care. This is a pretty gory movie, but it's not mean spirited at all. The most unexpected surprise is that the film has some nice messages about self esteem, and there's a genuinely touching romance in the centre of the film. I certainly wasn't expecting that at all, and that's why it comes so highly recommended. It may have buckets of blood, but it never feels mean spirited. It's a very fun horror comedy which deserves more attention than it gets. Seriously, give this one a look.8/10",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

83,estreet-eva,Why isn't Alan Tudyk a bigger star?,7,8 December 2017,"The central conceit - that the creepy hillbillies are actually the victims and the expendable college student the predators - is clever although it only carries the film so far. The true attraction here grows out of the interactions of the titular characters. Watching their friendly banter, their expression of feelings and the caring big brother / little brother dynamic makes for a compelling buddy comedy. The inclusion of, fortunately mostly cartoonish, gore does kind of reduce the warmth of the piece but it was necessary for the plot. While both Tucker and Dale benefit from excellent characterizations, Alan Tudyk shines in his role as a viewer surrogate much like the characters Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks played in their heydays. In short, there's a little too much slashy-slashy and stuff blowing up but ultimately the well-written and acted bromance elements are well worth watching",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

86,troyputland,Surprisingly great stuff!,8,7 September 2015,"It's best to approach Tucker and Dale vs. Evil on a whim. Having previously watched horrors like Wrong Turn and The Hills Have Eyes will add significant satire. Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) are your average red-necks; harmless on the inside even if a little intimidating on the outside. They're on vacation at their new 'cabin in the woods'. Travelling in their proximity is a group of college kids who think Tucker and Dale mean them harm. The key message here is to not judge a book by its cover. The preppy youngsters attack the hillbilly duo because they think they're attacking them. The events that unfold thereafter mock all serious gore films. It's genuinely funny, sporting the look of a horror and the feel of a comedy. The freak accidents threatening to kill off all the preps will have you in stitches, whilst Tucker and Dale are blissfully (or stupidly) unaware of how bad things are getting. The film's consistent, playing against all traditions. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil isn't one to miss.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
87,jose-cruz53,A very solid comedy,7,2 November 2012,"This was one of the most entertaining comedies that I have seem before I began my film journey a few month ago. Its very entertaining and is also quite violent, but it never takes itself seriously enough for the violence to have any serious meaning at all. Like violence in one of those Simpsons' horror episodes. This film entertains from beginning to finish.However, do not watch this film expecting some great work of art. This is not a great film, just a very entertaining and, yes, creative one. I would say it is better than 90% of the films out there. Though, to enjoy it fully, one must be immersed into the current mainstream North American zeitgeist.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
88,torstensonjohn,Tucker and Dale is Very Stale,4,14 July 2018,"Many viewers have considered this a cult classic for it's comedy and horror but this viewer says it falls flat. While there were some minor elements of humor I found the script to be poorly developed, the context of horror was laughable. A simpleminded plot based on college kids going to the lake and run into two hillbillies just out for their own redneck fun. Stereotypes develop the plot and away the stupidity goes. I felt compelled to give it 4 out of 10",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
89,carlos-pires,Must see horror comedy,9,24 December 2020,"This might not come to be a cult classic, but it is definitely one of the best horror comedies I have ever seen. The only problem for me is the terrible acting skills demonstrated by the guy how plays the antagonist. The supporting cast is also somewhat lame, but everything else is good.And even despite the above mentioned shortcomings, this turned out to be an exceptionally good horror comedy, probably due to the exceptionally good script and great sense of humor. There are no cheap laughs or over-the-top antics. The outrageously grim and silly situations come naturally and it all makes sense in a weird and funny way which is also refreshingly creative.I can't wait to see what these guys cook up next.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
90,thekyles99,Originality is a good thing!!!,5,13 February 2011,"Although not really that funny in my opinion i gave this flick a higher rating then i usually do because its synopsis alone should garner points for originality. You got two best buddies that i guess in some circles might be known as red necks however they are just two lifelong pals who have decided to go and take a small vacation in their vacation home cabin only to be accidentally misinterpreted to a band of college kids as mountain men/ homicidal killers so to speak. These college kids have obviously seen movies such as Deliverance or any of the Wrong Turn films once too often. After Dale says enough of this * bleep* and stands up to his fears of the opposite sex and actually rescues one of the college kids from drowning Alyson all her friends think he's a backwoods killer and in definite pitches to take out Dale and Tucker they end up taking themselves out one by one including an interesting scene with a wood chipper. this leads Dale at one point to scream out in a frenzy "" whats wrong with these kids??!!"" It might make most of you laugh and i think i laughed a couple of times but overall points for originality on this one.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
91,datorsiers2,A gem,10,23 December 2015,"This movie is extremely underrated to say the least. It is equal to ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland"" when it comes to the comedy/horror genre. Full of clever jokes, misunderstandings and funny parodies of horror movie clichés.This movie just takes everything we have seen in horror/slasher movies and makes fun of it in an awesome way. The whole plot is a whole misunderstanding which makes it absolutely hilarious. The story is original and never seen before, one you would not expect from a movie like this.People tend to pass watching this movie, because from the looks of it it has a lot of gory scenes, brutal kills, but in reality all deaths are silly, laughable accidents that make fun of horror movies. An absolutely genius horror comedy, doesn't matter if you dislike horror, just watch it for the laughs and this movie surely delivers more than a couple of them.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
92,tr91,Did I watch something different to everyone else?,5,7 October 2013,"I have just seen this film and it feels like I've watched something completely different to everyone else. It isn't even that funny, some moments will make you smile to yourself but I didn't find myself laughing out loud at all.The plot for this film did sound like a good idea but it was poorly executed. The film is predictable and just pretty stupid in general. The way some of the people die is mildly amusing due to the fact that it is so over the top to be scary despite all the blood, but again it is predictable. It was obvious which is why I didn't find it that funny, there was no surprise factor.The cast blew hot and cold for me. Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) both done a very good job. They were likable characters, especially Dale, and the silly conversations they had together were probably the scenes I enjoyed the most. Katrina Bowden also adds some charm but the rest of the cast were pretty dull.Overall I was disappointed, it may be worth a one time watch but to call it 'one of the funniest movies ever' is well over the top. Very few laughs and predictable all the way through. Wouldn't recommend.5/10.Watched the trailer again, all the best bits are in there. Just watch that, it's better than the actual film.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

I went into it with high hopes because everyone was saying it was funny and fresh. I thought the story had a lot of potential and it did capitalize on some of the parody aspects. The story to me was mostly unfunny.The acting is okay. The hillbilly accents do get annoying after a while.The pacing started off very good but lost some steam towards the end. The runtime is not overlong.The film does use gore and violence in a great way.Pros: Good premise, okay acting, short runtime, a great use of gore, and some funny jokesCons: Poor pacing, okay acting, the hillbilly accent gets annoying, and the story was mostly unfunnyOverall Rating: 6.0",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
94,jakebrann,Oh this is good...,9,27 May 2020,I just stumbled across this movie 10 years later while under quarantine and it is quite the find. Movies like this usually annoy me but this is more of a comedy spoof than an actual horror movie. This was really good and should have gotten a lot more attention and marketing when it came out. I laughed out loud several times. Watch it with some friends and have a good laugh...It won't disappoint...,Tucker and Dale vs Evil
95,repojack,Revenge of the hillbillies ...,8,11 October 2020,"Good horror-comedies are a rare find. It's not that there aren't many out there (""Cabin in the Woods,"" ""Tremors,"" and ""American Werewolf in London"" come to mind), it's just that there aren't many horror-comedies to choose from, period. Very likely it's not an easy exercise for filmmakers to balance comedy with scares/gore in a compelling way.""Tucker and Dale"" is one of the better ones that turns the backwoods/hillbilly/Texas Chainsaw formula on its head to hilarious results. Its more comedy than horror so its best not to take things too seriously and just enjoy the ride.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
96,utahman1971,Hilarious but stupid hilarious,5,9 March 2018,"Not all being stupid is hilarious but this is stupid. Just like being stupid is funny but some mixed with horror is good or the best. This one is mediocre with the mix. It is like watching Friends with horror added, which is not a great mix. So five stars for adding both together, which makes this film kind of stupid. You either have to be drunk or on dope to think this is the best film. I do not like or enjoy crude or rude dumb films.I gave it a five stars because at least is not actual crude or rude humor. I love horror movies but this humor is stupid to be with a horror movie. The Evil Dead movies are better than this. Those are actually funnier. If the characters act like they are not even graduated from high school kind of intelligence, then they are pretty much stupid, even if they are paid to act that way.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
97,tequila101,So Evil's deciding to mess with Hillbillies huh?,9,14 December 2011,"This film blew me out of the wind. The story, the characters, the acting, the plot, the action, the violence. Oh my god did I just love this film! It's one of those modernized films which will one day become a new classic. It's also a good film example about how to blend in the horror with the comedy. I think that was constructed together well.The story sets on some hill billies getting their vacation house, moving in, having the time of their lives until one day they spot a camper who falls into the water. They save her and help her out while her friends think they're gonna try and kill them. It all gets messy with horror, blood, gore, drama, romance, comedy, chills and thrills that come around thick and fast.I really loved the way this film unraveled itself up. I mean I was just surprised by what I saw because by the year 2010 or maybe 2008, horror directors would have stopped being creative. But this film is in no rush to get things happening on foot.The acting is superb in this film. The hillbillies and campers were realistic and developed well. I felt sorry for the hillbillies as that they didn't even mean to harm the kids while I wanted the kids to die. And what ways these kids died! It was funny to watch because it was really bizarre in how someone dodged, someone got a blade in the face, someone got cut up. It was all in good fun.I also loved how they made it creepy, with the Tucker and Dale's environment and yard looking isolated, gritty and dirty. This made us (the viewers) believe that the hillbillies were something out of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Wrong Turn"". Instead they are really nice and they made me laugh quite a bit. The director also mixes the comedy and creepy aspects in well, giving us a full on look of the atmosphere.Definitely watch it, and if it's a good price, BUY IT!!!! That's what I'm thinking of doing. It's not really scary but more funny than scary and creepy. Most likely one of the best modern horror films I have seen in a long time. Even the best horror-comedy of 2010! It's 9 bloody kills out of 10 for me on this one. SEE IT.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
98,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Campy Horror film With a Message,7,16 February 2012,"I had been meaning to check out this film since I saw the trailer a few months ago but it was never released around here. I know I keep saying that about films but it just seems like it's always the case. That whole no releases near us is weird because we are only an hour outside of LA as the crow flies. I think that is probably a good rant topic for another post. Anyhow, lucky day it's now available on Netflix for instant streaming.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil tells the tale of a couple of good old boys from Virginia who set off to their fixer up cabin in the woods in the hopes of relaxing, drinking some beers and doing a little fishing. Tucker and Dale look like your typical NASCAR watching, dip spitting, deer hunting hillbillies. Bad luck starts to befall them as they are set upon by a group of preppie college kids who decide to set up camp near their cabin. Happenstance and misunderstandings lead the spoiled college kids to determine that Tucker and Dale are deranged back woods hillbillies that want to cut them up with a chain saw.There is some gore, hot college girls in daisy dukes, horror and suspense in this film but it's not so bad that I didn't enjoy the film and I am not really into horror films. The movie actually is more of a Shaun of the Dead type anti-formulaic horror comedy. The set up is the same but the villains and heroes are not who you expect them to be. I think this film succeeds in poking fun at, while paying homage to the classic kids in the woods evil killer on the loose formula that we are all familiar with from numerous films. Horror movie clichés are tossed in the wood chipper as the film asks us to examine our own stereotypes and misconceptions about people. The film has a message but it does not hit you over the head like a pick axe with it.While not having the highest production values in the world and looking a bit like a film student's final project, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is still an enjoyable film. If you enjoy campy horror films and liked the Evil Dead franchise I think you may want to sit down with your beverage and snack of choice and fire up your Netflix to check this out.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

The story is a daft role reversal where the red necks are just going about their business, and the white college kids, in trying to 'protect' themselves form the, end up dying in horrific ways.

This is just a very fun and entertaining movie and i recommend it to everyone! i can assure you you'll have a fun time. All of the characters are likable and fun to watch and i thought the story was very creative and unique and that's what i like about this film.this film is much better than many comedy's out there today!. this film is definitely one of the best horror comedy's and would definitely be in my top ten list. this film all revolves around a bunch of misunderstandings between Tucker And Dale and the teenagers all because the teens get the wrong end of the stick.yes this film is silly and ridiculous and the sort of stuff that happened in this film would probably annoy me if it happened in a non comedy film but in this film it works because its supposed to be funny! and Tucker and Dale fit perfectly together as the funny guys. throughout the whole film the teenagers are running away from the two men and all the men want to do is talk to them!.HA HA i love the way this film progressed. this film is very funny and if your feeling down in the dumps watch this film and i can assure you it will cheer you up in no time!. you will be laughing so hard your bad mood will disappear!. this film is a classic and i found it very entertaining.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

As an avid horror fan, I had no expectations for Tucker and Dale. I basically watch anything and everything, and seeing as this was low-budget with very little publicity, I underestimated this. It has since become one of my favourite movies ever. Alan Tudyk is fantastic as always, and I had never seen Tyler Labine before but he basically steals the show. While the films it's ripping are pretty foul, T+D still manages to have a lot of heart, and Labine's character is so adorable! This does for The Hills Have Eyes what Shaun did for Dawn Of The Dead, while kicking Zombieland in the privates. Unmissable. This film has instant cult classic written all over it as the standard hillbilly survival horror is turned on its head. Two lovable bumpkins have to fight for their lives when a set of misguided teens think the well meaning duo are out to kill them in Texas Chainsaw / Deliverance style. You can't help but root for the hapless pair but also groan in enjoyable frustration as the teens start to drop dead in lots of extremely gory accidents.

Never ever. You might miss out on something that will give you a great time. In that way, I didn't know what to expect from this movie, so I just sat down to watch it, and after maybe five minutes I knew this was gonna be a great movie. Although I first thought it might be just another B-movie crappy comedy, it turned out that this movie is better than 90% of all movies I have ever seen. It simply got it all - gore, guts, glory, the laughs, the chicks, the guy you want to hate and see him bleed, and the likable heroes. The heroes of this movie are Tucker and Dale, two best friends who bought a cabin in the woods, where they want to spent their vacation fishing and enjoying themselves drinking beer and doing nothing. And then some crazy college kids have to come and ruin all. Spoiled college kids who just run around screaming, and killing themselves. Well, you'll have to figure it out for yourself anyway. Don't wanna spoil the fun.The movie is not just something for fans of B-movie horror movies and comedies, fans of the Evil Dead trilogy or stupid teenage horror movies. No, this is a movie that all fans of good entertainment can enjoy, and probably WILL enjoy. There wasn't a single boring moment during the whole movie. And there are not many movies than can keep you interested all the time. Just check it out and enjoy yourself.

107,rawiri42,A pleasant surprise.,7,9 October 2012,"I was lent the DVD of Tucker and Dale Vs Evil and decided to watch it without looking it up on IMDb first so I had no idea what to expect. There was no one in the cast that I knew and, from the title, I got the impression that it would be one of those low-budget horror movies that are OK if you happen to like low-budget horror movies. Well, at first, it seemed like my assessment was going to be pretty correct and, maybe worse, the whole thing was going to be yet another revamp of the college-kids-on-a-remote-vacation-in-a-forest affair. I wasn't even sure whether to continue watching. But then, just at the right time, everything took on a whole new complexion. I increasingly found myself being reduced to fits of laughter and asking myself why I was laughing at a gruesome horror movie and realising it was because it was actually very funny! Maybe I have a too-vivid imagination but, in spite of what was, to say the least, an extremely bizarre sequence of circumstances (most ending in gruesome disaster), it was remarkably believable - especially when one remembered that some of the kids were smoking dope and thus somewhat erratic in their reactions. After all, as one whose sport was orienteering, I am well aware that is IS actually possible to impale oneself on a sharp tree branch when not looking where one is going at full speed in a forest. (Fortunately, I never did it as dramatically as the young guy in this film!). Without going into each event in detail, when you think about it, none of the fatal events were ridiculous - although it might be true to say that for so many to happen all in a short space of time was! But then it IS a movie and, as such, needs to hold viewers' attention.The juxtaposition of a couple of simple but likable hillbilly guys, one very deranged college kid and several of his contemporaries resulted in a most entertaining and enjoyable hour-and-a-half. If you're not into horror movies, please don't let the fact that is categorised under that genre put you off watching Tucker and Dale vs Evil. You could just discover a different source of enjoyment. And, of course, the ending leaves the way wide open for lots more Tucker and dale sequels. Here's hoping!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It's very rare for horror or even comedies to get me to care about their characters, but this movie was an exception!
I see ""predictable"" in some of the other reviews, but this is not the case! I was expecting this to go the way of ""Of Mice and Men"". Spoilers for that book, Tucker and Dale are very similar to George and Lennie. Actually very similar! We were just missing the rabbits! Thus, I was predicting Tucker to have to kill Dale due to accidentally killing Allison. Honestly, there were a couple of parts of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat! ""Is Allison okay!??""
First in the cabin, one of the college kids was shooting their cabin with the sheriff's gun. I was expecting Allison to get hit by a stray bullet, and furthering the strife between Tucker, Dale, and the College Kids. But that would have been really tragic and broke the comedic tone. Then, at the end, I was expecting Allison to get hit with a bowling ball right after she took of the helmet Dale bought her. Like, all the college kids were cursed or something, ala Final Destination. So, yeah, this movie is far from predictable!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
110,GTeixeira,An horror comedy/parody that works,8,10 March 2014,"'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' is a really good satire of the hillbilly subgenre of horror films. In this subgenre, we often find ourselves with psycho, often inbred, serial-killing rednecks chasing young people in the woods (i.e..: 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'). In 'Tucker & Dale', the title characters are actually good guys on a vacation, who are targeted by young college kids who mistake them as stereotypical psychos.The premise works just like one would expect after thinking it over. Very funny, full of references to the subgenre, death scenes that really pay off, but its quality starts dropping after a while. It needs to rely too much on comedy-of-errors and coincidences, plot devices that end up being recycled/repeated to the point of getting tired. By the time it ends, it got too repetitive to work as well as it did near its beginning.Yet, despite its predictable unsustainability, the final product is so well executed it takes a long while for the quality drop; the main duo, Alan Tudyk (Tucker) and Tyler Labine (Dale), are excellent and one of the mains reasons this happens, being both very likable and funny as the straight-mans.The character of Chad (Jesse Moss; a sociopath proper boy), though a reasonable poking at a few horror clichés, is one of the weakest points of the film. Likewise, the romantic subplot between Dale and Allison (Katrina Bowden), while quite likable and even funny, tended to get a bit too sentimental in the latter portion of the film.Rather than an all-out parody, like the 'Scary Movie' franchise, 'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' bets on actual tale-telling. The premise predictably loses some power later in the film, but it still delivers nicely in a fun and satisfying way. Another complaint I have is the spoiler in the title.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

113,Corpus_Vile,You couldn't dislike this film if you tried,8,10 May 2011,"A group of college kids are going camping in the deep backwoods south for some drinkin', weed smokin' and skinny dippin'. Stopping for beer at a scuzzy looking store, they notice two mean and ornery looking hillbillies staring at them. When one of the hillbillies attempt to strike up a convo, the teens beat a hasty retreat, as let's face it, we all know what mean looking hillbillies tend to do with bothersome city slickers.However, looks can be deceiving. The two hillbillies are actually Tucker & Dale, two all round nice guys who wouldn't hurt a fly, and who are on their way to Dale's ""vacation home"" aka ramshackle shack in the woods, for their own vacation of drinkin', fishin' and doing repairs on the old homestead. One night, while fishing, they stumble across the teens skinny dipping, causing one of them to slip and bash her head on the rocks, and fall under the water unconscious. Dale immediately dives in to save her, after the teens run away, and take her back to the cabin to recover.However, to the teens, it looks like their friend has been kidnapped by murderous hillbillies, as they've seen enough horror films to know the score. Especially as a mountaintop massacre occurred on this very spot 20 years ago...Tucker & Dale Vs Evil is quite frankly a joy. A brilliant horror comedy, that brings forth plenty of belly laughs via a hilarious set of misunderstandings between the hillbillies and teens.Caught this at the Dead By Dawn fest and everyone was in absolute stitches at it. Great gore, hilarious laughs and surprisingly sweet, it's guaranteed to put a big sappy grin on your face at the end. A total crowd pleaser at the fest, and a warm hearted film to boot, that seamlessly blends its horror and comedic elements. 8/10, a total gem and I'm delighted to hear it's finally getting a DVD distribution, so that others can see it. Well recommended film for anyone, it's an absolute treat.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Treating your source material with so much respect while at the same time taking the crap out of it is just amazing.If you have seen ""Braindead"" or ""Sean of the Dead"" you might have a clue of what is lurking in this one. This movie is basically what ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is all about seen from a hillbilly point of view: A big misunderstanding. And what of a kind! The way the story unfolds is drawing in anybody with a hearth beat and the two main protagonists are just so lovable in their clumsiness its pretty impossible to not fever with them.I seriously doubted any comedy nowadays could make me laugh for something close to 90 minutes through. This one did. There are so many unforgettable scenes, that i keep wondering how Hollywood could come up with movies bare of any at all! The story might drop of a little at the end, but it's dropping of from a height normal flicks can barely dream of.Seriously, if you have just a glimpse of a heart for cheap gore movies, this one will touch all your sensitive spots, you'll giggle with excitement!

115,ivans536,Just not particularly funny...,5,4 March 2021,"While I do know that this is technically a satire of the horror genre, it's just not the funny kind of satire...You might think ""hm, that was clever"" a couple of times during the film, but except for calling out 30+ year old tropes and references from the same time period, the movie doesn't have much to offer.
Most of the scenes are very predictable, and of the group I watched it with no one laughed once.The whole stereotype twist is original, but get's tired after about the 2nd joke.
I'd still always pick Cabin in the Woods instead, from one of the most underrated directors of our time!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

117,pmdawn,"Hilarious and effective comedy ""horror"" done in a different way",9,30 September 2018,"Tucker & Dale vs Evil is a movie I've cherished for quite a few years now, having seen it shortly after it was released. I've just finished rewatching it for the the nth time now, and I just have to recommend this as great entertainment.It's a shame this movie isn't more well-known, for it is a perfect exercise in taking a premise and turning it upside down on its head. The movie is smart as well, featuring and exploring the ideas of perception, prejudice and lack of communication, but in a quick and very entertaining way. The acting is top-notch, specially Dale as portrayed by Tyler Labine.I don't want to get too much into the story, but when the villain(s?) are made clear, it's actually scary, and the ending was honestly quite riveting, with a perfect, sweet last shot that left me more than satisfied - and still laughing as the credits rolled.Totally recommended if you want a great bonafide comedy that's both smart and a laugh riot.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
118,spelvini,Hide All the Sharp Objects,9,6 March 2014,"You may have initial apprehensions about Tucker and Dale vs Evil (isn't the title too long and clumsy?), wondering what kind of film could fly without a ""name"" to latch onto. This will dissipate immediately as first-time director Eli Craig deftly weaves a visual treat from Morgan Jurgenson's script featuring a very funny Tyler Labine, and Katrina Bowden in a completely impossible love story.In the back woods of West Virginia good-natured redneck Dale (Tyler Labine), and his buddy Tucker (Alan Tudyk) are heading to their newly-purchased dilapidated cabin in the woods lovingly considered by them as their summer home. When they encounter a group of college kids vacationing nearby Dale is immediately smitten by the comely Allison (Katrina Bowden), but the backwoodsman fails mightily when he tries to strike up a conversation with her. The leader of the college kids, Chad (Jesse Moss) declares Tucker and Dale to be pure ""evil"" and incites the rest of the kids to attack them but the undergrads are so incompetent that a series of missteps causes mayhem. An outright confrontation leads to truth about one of the group but not without consequences.The film plays on all the well-worn clichés of the horror/slasher genre and director Eli Craig understands the intricacies of camera movement, music, and suspense so well that he can illicit laughter even without the aid of the very capable cast. The cast is also excellently chosen and this adds to how the film works to turn the genre on its head.One initial scene in which we get a taste of the first blood is when Tucker accidentally hits a Hornets nest while using a chain saw to cut some wood. As he attempts to shoo away the stinging bugs the college kids see him as a deranged homicidal madman and in their group reaction to him cause more misunderstanding leading to mayhem.Director Eli Craig is not ignorant to the tasks of actors, having played in Space cowboys in 2000 as Tommy Lee Jones' younger incarnation Hawk Hawkins under the direction of Clint Eastwood. This clearly transfers into the way he channels direction to his actors, having them play the small things between characters, mannerisms that illicit so much funniness.The best thing about Tucker and Dale is the expected gruesome body count that adds up in great unexpected and hilarious ways, always with an overt sense of dread on the part of all the characters. This way of playing all the scenes straight completes this wonderful spatter fest to a very satisfying climax.Some excellent moments are when college students attack the unknowing Tucker and Dale and accidentally wind up hoist on their own petard, prompting one character to surmise that ""These kids are coming out here, and killing themselves all over the woods"" as if it was a coed fad.Another moment when someone clearly has been hit with a sharp object and staggers away to die, another character surmises that ""he'll walk it off"" will make you laugh through cringing grimace.If there is an overt perspective on the film, it is that sometimes the harshest rites of passage accompany the creation of true love. And if Tucker and Dale vs Evil is the horror genre equivalent of Romeo and Juliet, it is a very satisfying romp in the woods, and funny too.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
119,aingmire-26563,Underwhelming.,7,17 August 2021,Tucker & Dale vs. Evil was a disappointment. It was actually really slow at parts and only some scenes were funny. The acting was actually pretty bad even from the main two people. I was expecting much more from this because Alan Tudyk is a great and funny actor.,Tucker and Dale vs Evil
120,holyspiritdriven,Pleasantly Surprised at How Funny this Movie Was,8,30 January 2012,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. I had low expectations because I thought this was made by the same people who made ""Hobo With a Shotgun"". I expected it to be B-rated with bad acting and a somewhat predictable plot. However I was pleasantly surprised! The few detractors are some foul language, goriness, and a very small & quick shot of nudity. The film title has you expecting a certain direction but it doesn't take long to realize the film is going somewhere else which kept the entire thing unpredictable. Except for some of the accidental death scenes being impossible in real life, the story was pretty believable. Though it is slapstick, there is a meaningful plot in there & cute little romance (not to mention the girl playing Allison is absolutely gorgeous). The acting, too surprised me. I bet we see some of these actors in the future! I don't know if the writers intended this, but there is also a commentary on prejudice. We often judge people by their looks instead of learning who they really are! I laughed hard!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
121,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Tucker & Dale Vs Evil,8,2 June 2011,"A bit of a breath of fresh air is this in a low budget and yet well produced comedy horror that gives Død Snø and the likes a run for their money. Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.At the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.Despite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).The best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film! Most of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.It's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status/topping Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

123,kimheniadis,"If this movie doesn't have a cult following, it should.",10,7 October 2016,"I don't know if this one has a cult following, but if it doesn't, it should. While it has a slight Evil Dead vibe, small cabin in the woods and people dying in crazy ways, it has it's own originality as well.Tucker and Dale (Tyler Labine, whom I adore in Deadbeat and Reaper) are friends who go up to Tucker's cabin to fix it up. On their way up, they run into some college kids who instantly judge them as being hillbillies. While Dale wants the kids to like them, Tucker could care less. They continue their way up to the cabin, and upon seeing it, the audience gets an instant creepy vibe, but Tucker and Dale are ecstatic to have a get-away home. While Dale and Tucker are checking out the cabin, Chad tells his friends a story about a Memorial Day Massacre, and the hillbillies who did all the killing. Through things we see in the cabin, the audience realizes that must have been where they lived.All of the kids just want to have a good time, except for Chad, who just seems a bit off, and wants to start some stuff with Tucker and Dale. The kids decide to go for a skinny dip later that evening, and one of the women falls into the lake and hits her head. Dale saves her and they bring her back to the cabin. This is where the fun begins. In a constant stream of miscommunication between the kids and Tucker and Dale, one accidental death leads to more, and finally an all out assault between the two groups. The deaths just keep getting crazier, and the final reveal, isn't shocking but it's amusing.Highly recommend this one if you enjoy the Evil Dead or Shaun of the Dead.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

127,UncleTantra,Wonderful!,10,17 February 2011,"Anyone who is a fan of the horror genre will want to add this to their Netflix queue, or better, see it in a theater, because laughter shared is better than laughing alone. ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" does for the Hillbilly slasher/chainsaw massacre genre exactly what ""Evil Dead 2"" did for the demon possession genre and what ""Shaun Of The Dead"" did for zombies. It takes the well-worn, done-hundreds-of-times conventions of horror movies and turns them into side-splitting (as opposed to skull-splitting) humor.The basic plot is that Tucker (Alan Tudyk, who played Wash in ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"") and Dale (Tyler Labine, whose work I don't know but will look into) are two not-completely-bright but sweet Virginia hillbillies looking forward to a vacation in their ""fixer upper"" cabin in the woods, and there kicking back and doing nothing more stimulating than fishing and drinking beer. To their dismay, a group of spoiled, Preppie college students decide to camp next door to their cabin. The students get it into their heads that Tucker & Dale are deranged, chainsaw-wielding serial killers, and react accordingly.The movie actually has a lot to say about stereotypes, and how people project onto others those stereotypes, and their own inner ""dark sides."" It's also at times hilariously funny, including an homage to the ""Groovy"" scene from ""Evil Dead 2"" (the corresponding great one-liner from this film is ""Bring it, frat bitch""). There is definitely blood and gore involved, but...uh...funny blood and gore, if you're into that sorta thing. This is really a surprisingly good movie. I am already salivating at the thought of a sequel.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
128,AnusPresley,A minor work of genius and a definite keeper for the collection,9,12 July 2015,"There is no genre so loathsome or guaranteed to make me roll my eyes and change channels than the American horror/comedy. The last work of any value here was probably the original _Re-Animator_ (tt0089885) with the prize tag-team of Stuart Gordon and Jeffrey Combs.I reluctantly gave this flick a chance, it was on late night teevee and there was nothing else whatsoever on offer, and I expected the absolute rock bottom worst - sophomoric, predictable tripe a la _Scary Movie_.What I got was _Scary Movie_'s absolute polar opposite - a slick, clever and thigh-slappingly, hysterically funny splatter fest. T&D vs. Evil takes the conventional ""stupid teenagers head to the woods and run into hillbilly serial killers"" slasher theme and turns it completely on its head. I won't say any more. This is one of those films where the less you know the better. Very, very highly recommended.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
129,larry.launders,This movie was a Doozy!,9,7 June 2015,"When I first saw the title and description, I thought ""oh great, another cheap horror flick.""Am I ever glad I got talked into watching this one! It is a somewhat classic horror movie setting and start, make no mistake. However, it does not take long at all to turn into the comedy it truly is. What a fresh take on putting a lot of horror movie cliché's to such comedic use! There are a lot of laugh out very loud moments throughout, and both Tyler Labine & Alan Tudyk do not disappoint! The rest of the cast (at least 2 of which are also main characters) does a wonderful job rounding out the whole experience. ""College kids go on a camping trip in the woods"" gets revitalized in the telling of this tale! It also does follow plenty of other previously tried and true formulas, and again, turns them on their ear - from hillbillies, spooky settings, isolation, and even romance. If you've seen your share (or at least heard about) many previous horror movie scenario's, you will find plenty to laugh at as all are taken and twisted into great comedy.

I wound up laughing pretty much from beginning to end. Absolutely brilliant parody of slasher movies. Something happened in it that was going to cost it two stars because I thought it went too far but it set up one of the funniest gags in the film so they got the stars back. I love both of the leads and it's by far one of the best things either has done. I'm trying not to do spoilers but it's hard because you want to talk about it but it's all funny, well except for one unfunny bit that sets up a hysterical gag. Just know it all works out in the end. The problem is I want a sequel but I'm glad they haven't done one because I;d be terrified it wouldn't measure up. Script, brilliant. Direction, excellent and the cast just knocks it out of the park.

137,Ben_Cap,A classic horror set-up with a comedy twist!,8,16 January 2016,"Tucker and Dale are just two guys who can't wait to get down to their new vacation home in the woods and just kick back with a few beers and do a little fishing. They had no idea that a group of young college kids were also heading to the same area to have a little fun of their own. That is one way this movie could be teased, another would be, A group of college friends stocked with beer, weed and bad ideas head out to the woods, where a couple of hillbillies are not too happy about their property being trespassed on. Either way you look at it, this vacation is going to be a mess.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a movie about perception. The director/writer Eli Craig has crafted a modern look at the oft copied slasher film formula and added a bit of life into a dying genre. Instead of showing us the events through the eyes of the victims, Craig turns the camera around and gives us a look through the eyes of the so called ""killers"". The college kids will jump to conclusions and make assumptions about Tucker and Dale and through a few misunderstandings will think Tucker and Dale are vicious murderers. On the flip side the duo will make some assumptions about the ""college kids"" of their own which will ultimately land them in deeper trouble.Leading the cast are Tyler Labine as Dale and Alan Tudyk as Tucker. Both just ooze comedy right into this chaotic few days in the woods. Both are just stellar and I don't think this movie would have been possible without either one. Tudyk has had an already long career in both comedy and serious roles. He has starred in both the TV show Firefly and its movie counterpart Serenity. He has lended his voice to animated features such as Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6. He has also played the villain in the Jackie Robinson movie, 42. Point being that even with such an impressive resume, this may be Tudyk's best performance to date. Labine, while less well known really steals the heart in this movie. He plays such a great big dumb lovable oaf, with a heart of gold. I will be looking for him in future releases for sure. The rest of the cast is rounded out by your basic slasher cast. A diverse group of kids from all different backgrounds, and while not as fleshed out as Tucker or Dale, they still play an important role in filling out the normal tropes.The comedy in this movie does not just come from the constant identity mix ups, but also from the writing. The movie seems to get funnier and funnier every time I see it. You will catch things you missed the first time, you will learn the funny little quirks of some of the characters that you can't wait to pop back up again. Writers Craig and Morgan Jurgenson have not only found a new way to tell a classic story, they have created a real full movie here, not just a gimmick and a good cast.I have watched Tucker and Dale vs. Evil 3 times now and each time with a different group of people. Each time i have thought that there may be someone of the group who may not like the movie, but I pressed on anyway to try to get as many people to see this movie as possible. Every person I have watched this movie with has loved it. Not once has someone said they either did not like it or down right hated it. The laughs are constant and the pacing keeps you into the movie, even once the original gimmick wears off. Tucker and Dale is truly a movie that I think everyone can find some enjoyment in, and that is a very difficult task to accomplish. So next time you and your friends can't decide on something to watch, give Tucker and Dale a try. I guarantee you wont be disappointed.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
138,peteranderson975,Playing with the slasher genre for laughs,8,18 July 2011,"Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are a couple of good friends who buy themselves a rundown cabin by a lake in the West Virginia mountains for holiday home where they can go fishing. At a gas station they meet up with bunch of rude obnoxious college kids whose ideas of country people come from watching too much Deliverance or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The college kids flee in panic after misunderstanding Dale's clumsy attempt at a friendly greeting. Misunderstandings continue when Tucker and Dale come across the college kids skinny dipping in the lake by their cabin while they are out fishing. One girl, Alison (Katrina Bowden), is startled when she sees them and slips on a rock and bangs her head. Dale rescues her from drowning but when they attempt to alert to the accident the other college kids they flee in panic, believing their friend has been captured. Unaware of this Tucker and Dale return to cabin with Alison to tend to her injuriesThe following day while Alison realises how they have misjudged the situation and gets friendly with Dale, her friends are outside planning to rescue her spurred on by her hillbilly hating boyfriend Chad (Jesse Moss). This leads to a series of hilarious gory fatal accidents caused by stupidity and panic. Tucker and Dale just can't seem to stop these idiots killing themselves.This is film is a lot of fun. It is definitely playing with tropes of the backwoods slasher genre, where the college kids are so conditioned by prejudices based on ideas of country people from these slasher films that they behave like they are in one and cause their own deaths by reactions based on their biased assumptions. It is a great piece of black comedy and that is down to believable performances from Tudyk and Labine as well a really funny script.Rating 7/10",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

145,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,When miscommunication kills.,7,22 October 2020,"Hilariously dumb, yet filled with so much heart, this movie might just be a hidden gem. It takes an absurd premise and has fun with it. Two hillbillies on vacation at their cabin are mistaken for killers by a group of college kids. It's just funny how a simple conversation would have prevented so much death. But Tucker and Dale are two of the most lovable idiot hillbillies I've ever seen. And watching the stereotypical frat bros and hot dumb chicks die was so satisfying (maybe too satisfying).However, this movie can be a victim of its own dumbness. In other words, power down that powerful brain of yours, put it in a dark lonely closet, and only then will you enjoy this movie. Some of the college kids play up their stereotypical roles well enough, but some are laughably bad. Some of the jokes require you to buy so many things to go right (or wrong) that if you have trouble buying just one thing, then the joke won't land. But in the end, this movie exceeded my expectations, I was laughing my whole way through, and I just had a really good time with it.Score: 7 out of 10

146,lornloxor,Bloody and Bloody Hilarious!,10,6 August 2013,"This is seriously one of the funniest comedies ever. I've shown this movie to many friends and everyone's always laughing like hell with tears running from their eyes. This should've been marketed more though, I don't see why this wouldn't have been a huge financial success if more people had known about it. Oh and if (or when!) you decide to watch it, do not watch the trailer under any circumstances! It spoils the movie way too much. Now about the characters. Tucker and Dale are just so damn likable as these two clueless hillbillies. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine act their roles so well and without these two the movie would be a whole less engaging a watch. The script and the writing in this movie is fantastic but Tudyk and Labine take the movie to a whole another level with their fantastic chemistry and impeccable comedic timing. Katrina Bowden is also great playing the more understanding college girl who's trying to defuse the situation. She was also great in Sex Drive (2008), one of my other favorite comedy movies. The other actors are also good and suit their roles well. In its core the movie is based around such a simple idea you have to wonder why this hadn't been done before. The writers clearly love horror movies so it's not so much a parody but a lovingly crafted tribute making fun of the genre's tropes. The movie works its way through the horror movie tropes so well while incorporating them to the larger story. The deaths in this movie are inventive and absolutely hilarious. I don't know if I've ever laughed that hard, I had tears running from my eyes for most of the movie. Amidst all the fun and death there are also some good albeit obvious points about first impressions and stereotypes. Despite all the gore and dying, it's still a surprisingly warmhearted movie.

148,markandkarenfitz,a hoot,10,16 July 2012,Rarely do I laugh like a hyena. Or at such ridiculous material. I think my young adult children thought I was losing it. They have yet to watch this film. Snobs. This kooky film is outrageous. It is mad cap and zany (the two most vile words ever in reviews because it so often refers to silly Brit sex comedies). But I relent and use these words to describe this slasher/camper/redneck romp. The characters are human cartoons and the predicaments and the consequences are hilarious.There is no point in describing the plot. The film's name and the cover art tells you all you need to know.This movie goes well with beer. Lots of beer. The cheap stuff.,Tucker and Dale vs Evil
149,ReelBrew,"A group of teens mistake two backwoods hillbillies for slashers, and one by one fall victim to stupidity.",7,12 December 2015,"Over three decades ago, Sean S. Cunningham brought the world Jason Voorhees, the water logged, back woods tromping, machete wielding maniac of the Friday the 13th series. Wearing raggedy clothing, a found hockey mask (in one scene a bag), and only emitting a few grunts here and there, Jason would haunt the grounds of Camp Crystal Lake, dispatching with any horny teen that came within a fifty foot radius of his old watering hole. Jason wasn't bright either, dreadfully mistaking a horny teen for his mother, simply because she wore the same moth infested sweater that she once had. All of these things amount to one of the first ""redneck"" killers, with the most notable attribute being the fact that he was brain dead, literally.For the next thirty or so years, the redneck stereotype would be played upon and upped, with the likes of Deliverance, Silence of the Lambs, and Wrong Turn helping pave the way for what would end up being a tremendously enjoyable stereotype to hack and slash its way into our hearts. What Tucker and Dale vs. Evil does effectively is that it plays just about each and every stereotype, then plays the complete opposite of what we have come to expect after all these years of incest and cannibalism.Tucker and Dale (played by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine respectively) are just a couple of hayseeds from up and over yonder, looking to renovate their newly purchased ""vacation"" home in the woods, when they encounter a group of horny, party hungry college co-eds. Tending to their renovations, their fishing rods, and their PBR, Tucker and Dale keep to themselves until Allison (Katrina Bowden) finds herself in need of help, which quickly becomes misconstrued as a kidnapping. What follows soon after is one misunderstanding after another, with hilarious yet deadly results.As horror/comedies go, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil delivers exactly what one would want from a combination like that, with buckets of blood spilling out just as quickly as the laughs. Dale's fluffy, shy, yet sensitive side dismisses all we have come to understand about the flesh hungry redneck killers of the past, and Tucker's guidance over Dale allows for that pitch perfect ""buddy cop"" feel. All that we supposedly know about rednecks and everything Tucker and Dale show us provides the blood and the laughs, with the laughs begetting the blood and the blood the laughs.As each scene transitions into the next, we slowly begin to see that this is Eli Craigs debut film, but its minor editing flaw is one that we immediately forget about as it only brings us the woes of Tucker and Dale even quicker. With chainsaws, machetes, woodchippers, weaponized sticks, and homemade moonshine making pit stops at every kids untimely demise, we are introduced to even more horror movie clichés, yet clichés that break apart clichés, providing perfectly pitched laughs and gore. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a movie that will repeatedly play in your head after the credits role, causing you to quote the hapless duo even after its short run in theaters is over, and recall the excessive gore well into the next Final Destination release.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

152,samuraifa451,Horror-comedy is back,7,1 January 2012,"Just when horror looks like it's gone completely stale, movies like ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" come out proving there's still more that can be done with the genre. Tucker and Dale are just two country boys who want to live out their dream to own a vacation home. Meanwhile, a group of college kids accidentally mistake them for being hostile which leads to unfortunate results. ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" may sound familiar but ultimately it's not. Instead of being a straight-up slasher flick, the film decides to be bold and through slapstick comedy into the killing which works surprisingly well. The majority of them are foreshadowed, but still never fail to achieve hilarity. Make no mistake ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" isn't the smartest movie on the block but it still packs more originality than most horror movies and more laughs than most comedies out right now.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

All but the most hardened fan could stomach everything produced around a monstrous killer stalking a group of babbling teenagers. Not in terms of gore, but quality. Good ideas are often not around and cheesy imitations tend to do the rounds often.There have been attempts to rework the slasher in a comedic sense. Scream probably did it best, but Tucker and Dale vs Evil comes close in quite a special way. It's not a mainstream movie, but this pseudo-parody of 'hillbilly horror' (think Deliverance or Wrong Turn 2) does a good job paying respect to the genre while also poking a lot of fun at it. Sure, not everyone will like it, but you can also pass it off as a very 'stupid' movie. A future cult classic.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

157,SeakDub,A Gold Mine.,10,3 March 2017,"Stumbling onto this movie is like stumbling into a gold mine. Pure gold is how I would put it. This movie was in all ways what I love. A perfect dark comedy in every element. If you have not seen this movie, this is a highly recommended movie. It starts off as any typical horror movie, you get the college kids, the creepy rednecks, and being in the woods with a cabin. You can see where this is going, but it isn't what you think. The couple of rednecks (played beautifully by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) who are just wanting to get away on vacation in their cabin in the woods. But comes along the college kids looking to party out in the woods and believes they are not who they seem. That is when the chaos ensues, believing the rednecks to be in-bred hillbilly killers. And all they wanted was to enjoy the peace and quiet. Comedy and gore makes this movie a 10 out of 10 for me. From the beginning to end I was laughing. Never a dull moment for me. I have re-watched this film numerous times and still find it as funny as the first time. If you are not into gore and blood you will not much enjoy the film much, but I do know people who are against death/gore/violence and have stated that this film was very clever and hilarious. Somehow the comedy from the morbid humor makes it a classic. This movie should be listed on the top #250 films on IMDb.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
158,JenEvans1,Amazingly Funny!,9,18 May 2011,"I LOVED this film. I really did! This has to be one of the funniest films I have seen in ages - well, the first 45 minutes of it, anyway. After that, although the film was still great, the humour became a little darker as the plot {???!!} took shape. I've got to admit that by this time I had absolutely no idea where this was going or how it could all end....However, I wasn't disappointed with the ending - as is so often the case with these sort of films. All too often, with a film like this, we are left hanging at the end with most of it unexplained. But here all the strings of the plot were drawn together neatly and I'm pleased to say that there were no questions left unanswered.Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk were amazing and even though I'd never even heard of either of them before this I am now a fan.And for those of you who (like me!!) hate gory horror I can truthfully say that all though it WAS gory, it was so incredibly funny that the horror didn't matter at all.

162,jcsuperjake,Tucker and Dale Vs. Awesomeness,10,27 December 2011,"Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil is one of those movies in which it seems like you either like it or hate it. I do think they should have promoted this movie more, because it deserved it. This was a very engrossing, entertaining little movie. Yes, it could be forgettable for some, but in my mind, I will try not to forget. This movie is about two hill billy friends named Tucker and Dale who have just rented a cabin for the summers. They try to have the best summer ever. But one day when they go fishing, they see these college students skinny dipping. One college girl slips off a rock and bangs her head. Dale swims to the rescue is saves her. They bring her back to the cabin, which I should mention is in the woods. The college kids however think they are kidnapping her, so they go out and try to kill the two dumb hill billies and save their friend. This was a very fun and entertaining movie, as I said. The moral of the story is quite obvious. I loved the different types of coincidences there are in this movie. They make funny of most horror movies. This movie has intentional bad, over the top acting which you can not get over. A well executed, well established comedy movie. Most people won't give this a chance because they think it is dumb or that it looks like your usual, terrible, wannabe movie. Yet, it isn't. It is a fun, campy comedy. I find this movie well underrated.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It's plot is established and then insanity ensues. Laughter and likability continues all throughout the movie, right until the very end.It's carried by strong acting by Tucker and Dale is perfection, which play a quintessential cult classic hillbillies role. The star of the movie is by far Dale, his amazing down to earth kindness, his witty dry humor, and his heroic villain persona - turn an otherwise terrible movie, into something special.Based on Dales performance alone, makes this movie more than watchable.

Good things it's on Netflix, though I will probably cave and buy it at some point.The leads are hilarious and adorable. I love their friendship and personalities. The college friends are clearly idiots and definitely make you think about the way people sometimes react in slasher films. I find it highly amusing that it's not in fact the ""murderous hillbillies"" but their own fear, prejudices, and assumptions that lead to their deaths.One of my favorite scenes is probably the one where Tucker is having a mini breakdown because a bunch of college kids ""are killing themselves all over his property.""P.S.

167,jeff-coatney,A Hidden Treasure,8,9 January 2011,"I saw the trailer to this film online and it seemed like a funny - yet unsustainable premise. I went to see it with friends anyway and I can't remember laughing so hard at a film in years. This movie takes a promising premise and knocks it out of the park. The cast is superb in this send-up of the psycho in the woods genre and the writing and direction take what I feared was an unsustainable premise and they give it surprising energy and humor. This is not Scary Movie crap. This is inventive and fresh and it has a beautiful heart. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are the ""Hillbillies"" in this hilarious tale of prejudice and paranoia and they deliver performances that are grounded and authentic. Tucker and Dale never become plodding stereotypes of ignorant rednecks. They are portrayed with great wit and dignity and the actors never overreach or retreat into the safety and insecurity of broad camp. The cast trusts the writing and the director and it pays off. The script by Morgan Jurgenson and director Eli Craig is tight, smart and has a wonderful heart. These qualities are given life by an above average cast that includes the lovely Katrina Bowden from NBC's 30 Rock. An especially guilty pleasure is the character of Chad, brilliantly played by Jesse Moss who channels some alternate universe version of a sociopathic Tom Cruise as the lead frat-boy. Eli Craig really guided home a winner with this film. The movie sets a course at the beginning and you know where you're headed in the first five minutes-- but Craig's the captain of the ship and this journey is filled with surprises and wonderfully subtle moments that give the film a fun trajectory and a brisk pace. You breezily travel through a fantastic, hilarious and utterly sublime entertainment. Bravo!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
168,Roddenhyzer,Unexpectedly hilarious,7,3 March 2011,"Let me just say that I am not a huge fan of horror comedies that rely purely on self-awareness, pop culture references and the ironic use of established genre clichés. There are a few good ones, like ""There's Nothing Out There"", ""Behind the Mask"", or Craven's ""Scream"", but most of them are so obsessed with self-irony that it becomes obnoxious and trite. For this reason, I did not expect ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" to entertain me even one bit. Well, long story short, I was ashamedly mistaken, because underneath all the genre parody and tongue-in-cheekness of this movie lies a genuinely creative premise, namely that of an ""accidental"" slasher in the woods, which lends itself to a few beautifully absurd and absolutely hilarious, darkly comedic situations.Aside from the basic idea, another element I liked were the rather atypical protagonists. Normally, writers aim for identifiability with their characters, which I assume is why so many horror comedies feature the same selection of cookie cutter college kids, or sarcastic, working class slackers. Tucker and Dale, as a pair of good-natured, slightly naive hillbillies, were quite refreshing in this regard.There are a few things I didn't like, though. Towards the end, for example, there's kind of a typical horror movie twist/reveal regarding one of the college kids, which I thought was neither necessary, nor all that clever. From this point onward, the movie changes gears from absurd humor to somewhat bland action. It's still watchable, but the showdown certainly sticks out as the weakest part of the movie.In closing, ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" was a big surprise for me. It successfully dodged many of the pitfalls of modern horror comedies, did *not* try to be yet another ""Shaun of the Dead"" clone, and, for the most part, managed to walk the fine line between mere references and genuinely clever, situational comedy.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
169,philipmorrison-73118,One to watch on Netflix,9,7 January 2016,"This is a great movie for comedy/horror. Ultimately, don't judge a book by its cover movie. In this movie the good guys look like the bad guys and vice versa. Although gory, the bumbling way that people die in this movie is hilarious. This movie reminds me of the old Abbot and Costello meets Boris Karloff movie, but a step up with the blood and gore. Basically, a bunch of college kids mistake a couple of country boys for something akin to ""Deliverance"". The college kids don't know it, but the country guys actually save one of their friends from drowning. Quickly she learns they are not the murderous type at all and befriends them pretty quickly. In the meantime, the college kid's fear is the catalyst to some very bizarre accidental deaths. Then the country guys think the college kids are out to kill them.

I could not have been more wrong. ""Tucker and Dale"" takes a standard horror-movie convention and absolutely, gleefully rips it to shreds.T&D are sweet and lovable hillbillies (really!) who become entangled in a series of violent deaths--none of which is their doing. And, much like Candy and Martin in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"", everything they do to fix the situation just makes it worse.The film is graphically gory, but the violence is played for gut-busting comedy.

174,The-Stalingraduates-review,surprisingly original and funny,8,7 October 2012,"Tucker and Dale are two best friends who have just bought a vacation home in the woods. but there fun is stopped by a group of college kids, cause while rescuing one of them from drowning in her unconsciousness (she hit her head) the rest run away thinking the two to be vicious murderers. this is fueled by a typical scary story (hillbillies murdered a group of people in that same area, but one survived) told by one of the kids, miscommunication between the two groups and plenty of amusing accidental suicides that are interpreted as murders. to start, what makes this film different to other horror comedies are two things. 1. the film is backwards. the usual villains and hero's are switched around to start, the college kids being sort of unintentional villains thinking that they are saving there friend, while the hillbillies are the hero's mistaken as villains who think these kids are killing themselves and also trying to kill Allison, the girl the two saved.2. it avoids and upends clichés. it doesn't make many mistakes in being original while making fun of some horror clichés. i enjoyed the whole miscommunication between the two groups, with both jumping to ridiculous and amusing conclusions in amongst the panic. i don't think a single murder in this was on purpose, one trips and jumps into a wood chipper, two impale themselves on sharp sticks, one even shoots himself in the face while taking the safety off the gun. most of these are seen by the college kids as murder due to the way its seen (tucker holding the kid who jumped in the wood chippers legs) overall this film ticks all the boxes to be a cult classic. its surprisingly original, has some great characters, gory deaths and is really funny to watch. its quite different to what you would normally watch in horror comedies and it succeeds really well in what it does. i would recommend this quite highly.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Otherwise, that's all you need to know what this film is about and how great it is going to be.And trust me, it's not only that good, it's the best original twist on the college kids in the woods with a serial killer genre pic since the first Evil Dead. I don't know if it even qualifies as a horror film as much as a gore/black comedy. And it is hilarious. The acting is great. The direction and writing are amazing. These are talents to watch all around. And, yes, though in this film they are not the focal point, you still get some nice young sexy hard-bodies to suit the formula.Prepare to laugh out loud, there is tons of gore, and it will just surprise you over and over, even if you end up finding the *surprise* ending a little too neat (I didn't mind it).

177,Fandust,"Bloody and a little cussy, but outrageous fun",9,21 April 2015,"I got wind of this movie from searching comedies IMDb top 1000 from 1995 onward. Something about the reviews impressed me more than usual. So glad I took a look. Very funny. I noticed some comments referring to the trailers. I hope the trailers didn't spoil the first scene were Dale is trying to make it with the college girl. That would be a shame. That's about the funniest movie scene I've ever seen. Better than anything from Woody Allen's early days. All you need to know is what's going on and a still picture from the perspective/view of the college girl. That should be in a movie poster, but not in a trailer. I don't think what I've said is a spoiler because it just tells you that it's very funny. Now that you know, maybe you won't die laughing and miss the rest of the movie. Otherwise... I enjoyed the romance. Did not enjoy the gore, but I suppose most people would consider it faky. Didn't like the foul language, but it wasn't pervasive. Like the synopsis says, this movie is a great twist on the worn out horror movie so often featuring inbred, chainsaw wielding hillbillies. Maybe it would have been more popular if they had named it something like ""College Kids Gone Wild"" instead of featuring the downtrodden hillbillies. Whether or not the fault was marketing, it's a downright shame this here movie was overlooked. In case it helps, other comedies I enjoy... Just Like Heaven (2005), Blazing Saddles (1974), Mars Attacks! (1996), Anchorman (2004) up until near the end, Caddyshack (1980), Dumb & Dumber (1994), Idiocracy (2006), Intolerable Cruelty (2003), Men in Black (1997).

The cinematography is great, not shying away from any visceral shots, and the lighting set a creepy yet light hearted atmosphere. The writing is brilliant, the main leads appear to be one dimensional at first but as the movie progresses I began to really take a shine to their antics. The characters are funny, but not one note, and the comedy goes in naturally with the gore. None of the jokes feel forced and are funny, with only a couple relying on cheap slap stick and toilet humor. If I were to fault it I would say that some of the action scenes are very outrageous, and one scene just made my palm slap my face with such force my nose nearly cracked (it involves a person trying to work a revolver, derp).All in all it was a great movie, that not only entertained me but also had endearing characters that are hard to find in this genre today.8.5/10",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

The Scary Movie franchise being the main offender.Tucker and Dale, on the other hand, is the exception to the rule!It's a kind of throwback to the days of Friday The 13th. Kids out camping in the woods, a couple of local rednecks scaring them and then everything gets out of hand, and someone gets chopped in half. That kind of thing. The difference with this film is that Tucker and Dale, whilst being the 'rednecks' we expect to appear in these kind of films, are actually just 2 nice guys who are doing some repairs to a cabin one of them owns. In a chain of misunderstandings the gang of kids suspect that Tucker and Dale have kidnapped and murdered their friend. The truth is however that the girl fell and was drowning when Tucker and Dale rescued her and took her to safety.The rest of the film is the kids' attempt to kill Tucker and Dale whilst attempting to rescue their friend.

Then this is a good flick for you.Tucker & Dale vs. Evil does not take itself very serious, and this is what makes this movie so easy to see. 90 min of splatter-fun and no big complicating story.A small movie, uncomplicated and fast. At least the 1st half is such a great entertaining. The 2nd part of the movie gets a bit slower, but is still good.The main duo is not clever and not the typical hero combination, and still they manage to be the ""nice"" guys.And once and for all the movie delivers a pretty clever message ;) : Most conflicts arise by a lack of comunication!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Not only are Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine amazing. The whole movie really flowed well, it felt smooth not like this part then this part and now this part. The pacing was good.The writing was excellent, so many absolutely hilarious lines I need to watch it again and again. The setting was good. I was afraid it would be too gory and it is gory but it felt just the right amount and it was mixed in with funny. There were many emotions.Alan Tudyk is brilliant. He is an amazing character actor and I love watching him and seeing someone new he creates. Tyler Labine I have been noticing for a while. I love the heart he puts into his characters.I think what I loved the most from this movie is how much it made me laugh and how little it grossed me out. Perfect Halloween movie but not for kids because of all the deaths.Eli Craig I look forward to seeing more movies by you. Morgan Jurgenson awesome lines too many funny ones to remember. Alan and Ty thank you so much for a great movie. College kids way to go! I left the movie feeling fully satisfied and happy that the movie was better than I even hoped for. I went with my Mom and younger sister and they both loved it as well.Rosie long time Alan Tudyk fan",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
189,dacksonflux,A very special movie...,4,20 September 2017,"I adore this film. It is particularly pleasant to watch with a delightful end. There are a few aspects of this movie that impress me:1. It takes a Mary Sue type of character, and manages to make her not too irritating. She's borderline tolerable, mostly because she's viciously abused throughout the movie.2. It's about college kids vs. hillbillies, & the hillbillies aren't cannibals, serial killers, incestuous rapists, etc... their only stereotypes are beer, fishing, & overalls.3. Feel free to care about the leads, they have hearts of gold.4. Feel free to hate the antagonist, you'll know who it is within 20 minutes of watching the movie.5. Despite the very clearly depicted roles, I didn't completely predict the end.6. It's not meant to be a work of art; but a very well produced, directed, acted, & edited lighthearted comedy.7. There's an obscene amount of violence, but it's quite satisfying.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
190,Tecnicinismo,"Succeeds in every aspect in which other horror ""parodies"" fail catastrophically",9,14 August 2018,"I have the belief that there are two genres that are extremely hard to get right without becoming repetitive and generic, and those are comedy and horror.
Now imagine blending those two genres to make a competitive film altogether.With that said, this movie was a blast from start to finish, and believe it or not, it has a really toughtful message about looks, self confidence and communication. At the same time delivering a gruesome and funny galore of gore and psycho madness.
The film will take all the tropes from the horror and comedy stories you either love or hate, and will twist them in the most hysterical way possible to make one of the best horror comedies made to date.Do not miss this one, and if possible, avoid looking for any trailers or plot details, watch it blindly and discover the full experience by yourself.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
191,ZombiGurl,A Comedy of Errors,8,1 January 2012,"Tucker and Dale vs. EvilTucker and Dale are two good old boys heading up to their cabin in the woods for some vacation time. Tucker has recently bought a fixer-upper Cabin and the two friends want to spend a week working on their ""Vacation Home"" and some fishing. The Cabin looks like something out of Wrong Turn or Evil Dead 2, But Tucker and Dale are not deterred from fixing it up. Pretty soon a group of College kids show up at a nearby camp and immediately wrongly assume Tucker and Dale are psychotic ""Hillbillies"" out to murder them. Considering that the Cabin and property are filled with tools for a Reno, such as Chainsaws and a Woodchipper, it's not long before the comedy and gruesome carnage start to ensue. This was one of funniest and surprising movies that I watched this year. A comedy of errors that results in lots of gory and creative deaths for the dim-witted college kids. What makes this movie special is the relationship between Tucker and Dale. They are two sweet, helpful, and hopelessly clueless guys that get caught up in the disaster that the College kids created. This will be one of those movies I like to watch again and again when nothing else is on. One message that certainly comes across loud and clear is that appearances can be deceiving and that the Frat Boys shouldn't have judged the proverbial book by the cover. People are individuals and not just their stereotypes.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

I will show it to my friends but I will advise them that the trailer is a spoiler. Just because of that fact the movie was way less enjoyable than what it should have been and what is why I gave it a 7.I'm surprised this move scored higher than ""The Cabin in the Woods."" I know it's trailer is not as appealing but it scores high on the lists for the best horror flicks. From the trailer it doesn't look like a comedy but it is if you in tune with business acts. Most stay at home Dads or Moms my have trouble understanding it's comic appeal.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

I knew it was a horror comedy, and wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, because I am more of a horror freak, but man am I glad I did. This movie knocked it out of the park. The cast was great. They fed off of each other like they were working together for years, and the writing was simply outstanding. Two backwoods rednecks who have no idea that the young campers believe them to be serial killers, are hilarious as they stumble through the woods trying to figure out why these young people are spontaneously committing suicide. They have no idea what's going on around them, and even less of a clue that their dream cabin was home to a psychopathic serial killer from years past. Tucker and Dale redefine comedy is this awesomely funny movie, centered around two clueless nitwits who just want to relax and enjoy their life. MAJOR THUMBS UP!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It was 3 in the am and I was laughing so hard, like a hyena in heat! I swear these guys were so damn stupid, the college kids were freaking killing me! This is a must see for comedy lover for real. It was totally original , great idea, great story-line. Some of the Best worst acting I have seen, you'll understand! I never knew Tyler Labine b4 this, but that is my dude now man! After this, I saw cottage country which is another one of his flicks, equally hilarious but I'll write a review in a few.

It perfectly skewers the classic b-movie slasher movie tropes. There are soooooo many skits in it which stick with me, especially the wood chipper scene and the reaction of Dale. It is absolutely brilliant and I 100% recommend you watch it. It is definitely a hidden gem. So much so I bought it to keep and rewatch repeatedly. Forget The Cabin In The Woods, THIS is the horror movie parody you need to see.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
198,Cinematic1965,So Entertaining and Hillarious!,7,26 October 2018,"There are a lot of actors in the movie, but only four who survive long enough to make a difference. Tyler Labine, as Dale, is a pudgy victim of low self-esteem, and Alan Tudyk, as Tucker, is his patient best pal, sometimes exasperated by him in the tradition of Laurel and Hardy. As Allison, herself a farm girl, Katrina Bowden is instinctively sympathetic to Dale. And Jesse Moss plays Chad, the leader of the college kids, who is a ferocious and hateful young man with a lifelong score to settle. The movie gives them not much more to do than fill their simple roles, which they do nicely. It's amusing when Allison tries to broker better communications between the two sides.Students of the Little Movie Glossary may find it funny how carefully ""Tucker and Dale"" works its way through upended cliches. I though it had done a pretty complete job already, including the two or three chainsaws and the wood chipper, but I was much gratified at the end when a sawmill turned up.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
199,danguercio,"Honestly, surprisingly fantastic",10,18 March 2020,"At first glance it may seem unappealing. It's obviously a sort of black comedy that's a satire of a horror film. Been there, done that. But, good God is this better than the usual ""scary movie"" trope. It completely turns the genre of horror on its head. When you expect to see the usual you see the opposite. This is satire at it's peak. Each usual trope played to the max and the general theme of horror movies reversed. It seems to be such an underrated film. It's funny in a non-campy way. It's gory in a sense that only plays to the satire. It's romantic in a way that fits the message and theme of the movie while still adhearing to the overplayed saterical element of it. It will make you root for the underdog in ways that so many movies have done before, but in a way that feels fresh and new. In my opinion, horror fans will love it, comedy fans will love it, and fans of things like cards against humanity will love it. This is dark, saterical humour at its finest. Never laughed so much at dumb college kids dying. A must watch. Period.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
200,tulhamano,As good as possible.,8,4 June 2012,"Horror and Comedy? Seems impossible to be scared an laugh at the same time, seems to me like a waste of time idea. Tucker and Dale went as far as possible. Maybe not far enough, you probably wont laugh enough neither you be scared enough, but this creative movie did the best possible to mix this two elements. Apart from that you will probably fall in love with this two characters, and would be great to see some kind of series with Tucker and Dale, I want to see more from them they create a ""perfect"" match and their relation is alone worth the watching. I give it 8 not because I enjoyed SO MUCH but because they did the best possible and were creative and innovative.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Better twist on the cabin in the woods story than the actual movie Cabin in the Woods that everyone talked about. I don't have much to add that was already written but this was an enjoyable hour and a half with many laughs to be had. I loved it! You can tell the writers really had a love of the genre. I do not know if someone not familiar with the conventions of the ""teens camping in the woods attacked by hillbillies"" would appreciate this movie. But if you do, it is hilarious. Obviously this was not meant to be great cinema, but for what it is supposed to be it nails it. It is easily available on Netflix and it was a great pick for the evening.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It never wears out its premise. The main characters are hilarious and most importantly, are characters you care about. The college kids, like in most slashers, are two dimensional, but it is part of the clichés this film pokes fun of so well.All in all, it is a shame that such a hilarious film gets to cinemas unnoticed, especially in a year where so many R-Rated comedies have found success at the box-office.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

204,bozinovska_jovana,It's okay,5,2 August 2013,"Recently, I came to like comedy-horror movies. But, you can see right away that in this movie, the comedy wins. It wasn't scary, it was just nasty. The story was quite predictable for me, but still enjoyable. I mean, after the first kill, you just know that, that is all what will be going on in the whole movie. There were a lot of scenes that made me say: ""yeah, that will only happen in a movie"". Mostly I loved Tucker and Dale and their dialog.There is a lot of blood, so if you're one of the fainthearted, be warned. I didn't like the fact that the main characters got away with what happened, I mean they weren't charged or accused of anything when they should have been. That part wasn't well done. I mean, when you make a horror story to seem more real, you should include real parts of the life, too. There were no zombies, no evil spirits or creatures, so why exclude the reality. And that is why I say ""only in a movie!"". Be as it is, I expected more of this movie.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

There are a lot of unfortunate events in the movie that make you laugh till you cry. And the best part of it, is that the events are not some of those dumb ""split on banana skin and broke the neck"" but are very natural and very well intervened. Acting is superb. Both Tucker and Dale are so well played that I would reward them without another minute of thinking if I had the Oscars in my pocket.A must see. Wonderful addition to the Comedy collection.Keep it up guys whoever you are.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
207,milosz-skow,A mighty fine piece of cinema right there,8,11 June 2015,"For what it is - a lighthearted spoof of a hillbilly horror genre, this film has a surprising amount of depth to it. And I'm not just talking about the comedy aspect. The entire theme of the movie centres just as much around the stereotyping that the ""West Virginia folk"" suffer from, as it does around the preppy college kid trope in horror movies. And it does it in style. Even though some of the deaths seem improbable at best, they send the right message in the context of the story. The Chekhov's gun has fired and it keeps firing throughout the film. The script keeps you jumping from one set of shoes to another until you're left wandering, who the hell is the bad guy here, and if there's a bad guy here at all? This is the essence of the movie in terms of the message and it delivers in that department. It really does. But enough about the boring stuff, lets focus on what's important...Is it funny? Yes. It's funny and original and everything you'd want from a spoof comedy. The references to the hillbilly horror movies are certainly there, and they are presented in such a way that a newcomer to the genre will still find the scenes funny, but a connoisseur will savour the additional layer of gory sweetness as it comes. One. Bloody. Bit. At a time. Delicious!Acting is OK for what it is supposed to represent. It's not believable to the point of immersion, but it doesn't feel like it's supposed to be immersive too. It's just the right balance of acting versus goofery you'd come to expect from a spoof film. Plus some unscripted scenes make the movie that much more entertaining - apparently, in hillbilly country, beer is good for everything ;)In summary, if you're looking for something to watch with your friends over a pizza, you'd have to look far and wide to find something more entertaining (but not stupid) than this. It's funny, energetic, thoughtful, and it will keep you talking for the rest of the evening in that holiday house you just bought with your friends. Just keep your eyes peeled for them pesky college kids! Or things might get a little... bloody!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

I watched it again when it became available on Netflix. It was even more hilarious the second time. I hate to sound cliché' but this is an instant classic. This movie has everything you could ever want from a hilarious slasher/accident movie. If you like ""Shaun of the Dead"" you will definitely like this movie. I highly recommend this movie to all who pull for the underdog. I plan on picking this movie up the next time I am in the store and watching it again and again just to catch up on all the parts I have missed during my laughter.

209,cthulu17,Fun and entertaining genre film,8,6 May 2012,"It's time for an indie movie review! What do you get when you mix classic gore/slasher elements with a comedy? Usually something pretty godawful and not worth mentioning here or anywhere else. However, sometimes, the slasher/comedy combo can be pulled off competently. Please note that all of the ""Scary movie"" entries are complete and utter failures and I have no idea how they made 4 of the damned things, the first one wasn't even that funny.Fortunately I am glad to report that Tucker & Dale is a success story for slasher/comedy combos. Now admittedly I am getting to this movie a bit late, it was making the indie circuit about this time last year. However, indie films are a little quirky in when and where they're released (reference similar issues I had with Boondock Saints II). But happy days are here and I found this little gem amongst a rather large pile of dross whilst wandering through the cavernous expanse of the interblag...blag.....blag.....blag (this joke would probably be a lot funnier if I had audio, but I refuse to let you people hear my actual voice, sounds terrible over a mic).So what makes Tucker & Dale a success? If I had to pin it on any single element of the production, it would be that the story at its core is quite simple: a single misunderstanding explodes completely out of proportion. There's no sleight of hand and no fancy tricks, just stupid people making assumptions based on fear. Now there's plenty of gore, but the way it ends up happening is actually pretty inventive and I won't spoil anything, but I think its good to see classic slapstick reapplied to the horror genre. God knows it needs an overhaul in the creativity department these days.So anyhow, good fun romp, see it if you can. It will likely be available on netflix in the coming months.Peace out everyone.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

That is the easiest way for me to describe Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. It's a delightfully fun take on a backwoods redneck slasher movietold from the perspective of two rednecks, who want to do nothing more, than to fix up their new summer cabin and do some fishing. Unfortunately, this plan is disturbed by a group of college kids armed with nothing but alcohol and their own fears. What ensues is a laugh out loud gorishly twisted take on slasher movies. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine play the characters of Tucker and Dale respectively and the viewer is absorbed into their simple lives of beer and fishing. Tudyk continues to impress me with all the many different roles and comedic characters he has adopted in his career. It is a very gory movie, but done in such a playful way it is hard not to laugh. For any fans of the horror genre, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a fun time that prods at other slasher flicks based on stupid college kids go into the woods.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Even the small-role actors were awesome in their spots. Facial expressions fit perfectly. 2. The filming (angles, fades, zooms, etc.) was better than appropriate and made it exciting. It also helped bring in the funny.The same exact story could have been done with a different set of people and typical horror filming, and it could have been a dud. But, the right combination made this for a quality, humorous, extremely fun movie that I would watch again more than once (which moved it up to a 7 for me...that's not common either).If someone says ""Move over Shaun of the Dead""...they should be slapped. This movie does not even come close to the terrific wit of SotD, but the stupid, redneck humor and all other components make it the W. Virgina version of SotD. Different, but right on par with quality and entertainment value.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
216,wdytreviews,Abbot and Costello meet Sam Raimi,6,27 August 2011,"What did I think? 3 of 5 stars. Really good for a slapstick comedy about a Tucker and Dale a couple good olé boys in WV (Canada really)who are looking to repair an old 'vacation' cabin Tucker bought. On the way to the cabin they encounter a van full of college that have seen one to many slasher films and think that the duo are 'creepy'. The best moment in the film may take place at the gas station where Dale tries to communicate with the college girls, Tyler Labine as Dale is talked in to trying to talk to the girls by his friend Tucker played by Alan Tudyk. Dale walks up to the girls following a can of liquid courage and unconsciously grabs a scythe with a 7 foot long handle. Tucker's best advise is to 'smile and laugh' which is undermined by Dale's underlying nervousness and low self worth. He walks up to the girls carrying a scythe, dirty and totally awkward. They look at him like he is as crazy as he looks. And it only gets worse as he tries to talk to them laughing and smiling manically which Tyler pulls off perfectly. From there the movie just moves into misunderstanding mode. The movie moves to the main setting of the backwoods cabin (very similar to the Evil Dead cabin) by the lake where the college kids are camping led by the unhinged frat boy Chad (Jesse Moss). He spooks his fellow campers, four men and three women, with a tale of a massacre in those woods 20 years ago. There are plenty of homages in this send up of slasher films of the 80's. Evil Dead, Friday the 13th and Elm Street are the obvious winks. The crux of the movie is that the over-amped and easily persuaded twenty-something college kids are quickly whipped into a frenzy by Chad when Allison falls off a rock at the lake while undressing and they view Tucker and Dale rescue her but in their eyes are kidnapping her. The good Samaritans take her back to their cabin when the kids run off in fear to find Chad. Chad is ready to fight to the death to find Allison who he fancies. He intimidates and recruits the rest from rationality and go after Tucker and Dale which only ends often hilarious examples of 1,000 Ways to Die. The movie lulls a little in the middle act but comes back together for the finale. Very solid movie, the script could have used a little more polishing but the characters are all very entertaining and there are some classic death scenes. Two good acts and one slow one but the movie is paced very well. Check this one out it will be far better than many of the major released horror movies in the theaters.What did you think?

The beautiful Katrina Bowden who plays Allison had me laughing with her anti-climatic, level-headed character no matter how much horror and mayhem is going on around her. Lastly Jesse Moss who plays Chad had me giggling and simultaneously rolling my eyes at his over-acting as the self-proclaimed ""leader"" of the band of college kids.

220,Herpumpkin,"""What we have here, is a failure to communicate...""",8,3 December 2011,"How many times do we go out of our way to avoid ""that type of person""? Whether that ""type"" is someone we feel is threatening, dangerous, or just somebody we think would just ruin our day? I know I have.I'm not proud to admit it, but I've often created entire lives for people from just one glance, and assured myself that my imagination has threaded their personalities to a tee. So much so, that I feel satisfied not even confirming my suspicions; affirmations become by products of my delusions. Sometimes, I won't even allow myself the possibility of surprise. All from just a glance.Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil is a horror movie at a glance, but given the opportunity, it may surprise its viewers, revealing itself as a heartfelt fable at its hill-billy core. In this film, the horror genre is more of a paradigm, used to tell a deeper and more insightful tale compared to most contemporary horror films.Like most horror films nowadays, it begins with a young cast of teenagers, en route to escape the civilized world and embark on a camping trip filled with sex, drugs, and everything else college kids are expected to do. All of the token victims are present, accounted for, (the alpha male, the one black kid, the ditsy blonde with big boobs etc.) and seemingly placed upon the slab, practically begging a villain for killin'.Then, there's Tucker and Dale.The innocent group of college kids immediately type-cast the duo as two lunatic hillbillies straight out of a horror movie, poisoned from dime-a-dozen Hollywood clichés! They're instantly threatened by the pair and agree to stay far away from them through the remainder of their vacation.Meanwhile, there's Tucker and Dale.Tucker and Dale would like nothing better to do then fix up their new vacation home, which happens to look like it came from the set of an Evil Dead remake. The two characters are good ol' boys, a bit cliché, again at a glance, but have the tendency to grow on the viewer quicker than one can pop the top of a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Tucker is the grounded center of the two and the voice of reason, leaving Dale as the lovable comic relief.I have to say, Tyler Labine as Dale really steals the show. His portrayal of the moronic oaf constantly reminds the viewer that amongst all the blood and guts, this film has a big soft gooey heart on the inside. His character is the medium that best delivers all the sincerity of this film home, and another quality that sets this movie apart from the rest.Honorable mention goes to, of course, Alan Tudyk, a very underrated ""hey, it's that guy"" actor. His comedic delivery was never in question, personally, however. Don't agree? Check out ""Death at a Funeral"" and not the one with Chris Rock! The original! ""Death at a Funeral"" has Alan Tudyk constantly delivering comedic blows.Things really begin to turn a darker corner when Tucker and Dale rescue one of the college kids from nearly drowning. As Tucker and Dale are merely trying to do the right thing, the rest of the collegians think that the two hillbillies are kidnapping their friend, because that's what hillbillies do right? Kidnap young girls, take them back to shady cabins in the middle of nowhere, and skin them alive! Right? ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" succeeds in addressing a major concern in modern America, miscommunication! Personally, I really felt as if Eli Craig, the director and co-writer, was commenting on our fears and our lethargy, as Americans, concerning how we perceive ""strangers"" or people we do not know. According to Craig, and I would have to agree, we would rather allow our imaginations and context misrepresent ""strangers"" than assemble the responsibility required to get to know them. It's just easier to dismiss ""them"" as simply someone that is similar to somebody we have met in the past or somebody we do would not have pleasure in knowing.There's a conversation in the beginning of the movie between two characters about the owners of a dirty pick-up (who happen to be Tucker and Dale). One character says, commenting on the vehicle, ""We're in hillbilly country, now, boys! Squeal like a pig! Sooo-weeee!"" In response to this statement, a young girl says, ""Chad, just because they're not in your fraternity doesn't mean their freaks"". ""Well, actually it does Allison,"" says Chad. ""You're either Omega Beta or your a freak"".I think that exchange sums up the series of misunderstanding that plagues the group of college students during the entire film. The college characters were quick to assume and judge based upon surface details. I feel that Eli Craig was cautioning those who are quick to make snappy assumptions based upon only what the eye can see.Whether or not ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" will teach you the significance of getting to know you're fellow man, it will certainly entertain. The film is a blast from fade in to fade out and full of fun, to boot. I highly recommend this title for anyone wanting a break from your typical horror movie slasher.""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" certainly spins a healthy alternative to the excessively worn Slasher sub-genre of horror and even leaves something for the audience to critically think about after the credits roll.Believe it or not, there is even evidence of Rom-Com formula in this movie, so it is definitely couple approved. Now when was the last time a horror movie had all of the above? For all of my fellow gore-hounds, don't expect any Fulci or Jackson splatter, not even on the levels of ""Shaun of the Dead"". This film is tame by those standards, but the ""money-shots"" do exist. Woodchipper = Awesome!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
221,mrbblee,A Great Movie Kept Hidden Until Now...,10,17 August 2011,"I was one of the few UK residents fortunate enough to be able to see this movie as it stayed hidden away from the public only popping up at certain festivals and in certain European countries. Now (and thankfully) it's finally getting a release I find myself both over-joyed and a little bit sad.I'm overjoyed because if any movie deserves to be seen by the WHOLE movie going public then Tucker and Dale is certainly it. But I'm also sad because I found it thrilling that this movie was one of those I could ask friends ""Have you seen Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil? No? Oh you REALLY need to see it!!"" It felt like it was my job to make the world aware of just how good it really is. So now (and again, I say, quite rightly so) it's getting a release, albeit a limited one, no longer can I act like I discovered this film! The reason I feel the way I do about this film is because it's one of the few movies to come along in the last 5 years that is both well written and well-acted. And as well as those two great points it also has the bonus of being a very clever movie. The title characters are played with such great enthusiasm by Labine and Tudyk that it rubs off on the rest of the cast and you can see everyone is having the time of their lives.I'll admit that this film won't go down in the halls of fame but it will get Director Eli Craig the recognition he deserves. Now that Edgar Wright seems to have gone quiet it's time for a new kid on the block and Craig could be just that man. His direction is bordering on greatness and, given the opportunity, he could (and should) go on to great things.If I'm forced to say anything negative about this movie then my only criticism would be that at times some of the gags feel a little forced. Maybe that's down to the script writers or maybe it was down to the delivery by the cast. Either way the plus points of Tucker and Dale more than make up for these little faults.Please, I beg of you, turn this little underground movie into the sleeper hit it so rightly deserves to be!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

What the college kids don't take the time to notice is these 'hillbillies' are just two sweet old country boys headed to the same lake to work on a 'vacation cabin,' not the blood thirsty backwoods cannibals they leave believing they are...let the misunderstandings begin. ....TUCKER & DALE is well done, fun to watch, has some great deaths and doesn't take it self seriously, which is why it works. It's a great spin on the killer in the woods idea and the paranoia those movies have created in the mind of 'city folk.' I had a blast with this one...the kills (which are all by accident and misfortune) are cool, gory and funny and there are a bunch...so by all means sit back, fire up the old NetFlix instant streaming and watch this one... HOT CHICKS - You bet you sleeveless hillbilly flannel ....Kastrina Bowden (star of the upcoming PIRANHA 3DD and Chelan Simmons (the girl that got baked in the tanning bed in FINAL DESTINATION 3) WHO WOULD LIKE IT - Shaun of the Dead fans/Slasher movie fans/Horror fans COOL ACTOR WHO ISN'T IN ENOUGH MOVIES ALERT - Alan Tudykn as Tucker (SERENITY, Pirate guy in DODGEBALL, stars in the upcoming ABRAHAM LINCOLN:VAMPIRE HUNTER)...This guy is my new Bruce Campbell.

224,eyestoremember,A brilliant parody of in the woods horror genre...off your seat fun,9,27 March 2013,Although people call me a lenient but believe me when i say this that this film is one of the true geniuses that deserves the blockbuster status and really shows how blind studio people are to some true talent. Such an amazing comedy showing the loopholes on which some slasher horror flicks derive. The impeccable comic timing of all the actors especially the two leading men are pure hilarious and will make you fall from your seats like crazy and the screenplays deserves all the credit. These are one of the few movies you wish you had seen in a theatre. Tragedy that such films in absence of studio funding don't make it to international screens. Believe me guys you don't want to miss this one for anything.The film leaves you asking for more....Amazing creativity This film is now on my most favourite listThis film is beyond ratings....A true classic,Tucker and Dale vs Evil
225,mofo_rob,Fun fun and more fun,9,1 October 2017,"In true teen horror flick style, some college frat house boys are on a road trip with some hot girls. The terror starts when they realise they've left all their beer behind and end up stopping off in some sort of incesty, hills have eyes, weird old town. This is where they meet (and are freaked out by) Tucker and Dale. The college kids later find themselves camping in the same woods where Tucker and Dale have just bought a new holiday home. They go skinny dipping (obviously) in the lake, as Tucker and Dale are fishing. Allison, who is the love interest of the main man, Chad, falls in and as the two pals save her on their boat, the kids assume they are weird psycho killers who have captured her. Hilarity follows and as Allison's friends try to save her, completely innocent circumstances result in them being mutilated or impaled in one way or another.What I liked most about this was that the humour was quite natural. It wasn't forced or cheesy and I found myself giggling practically throughout the whole film. That's quite unusual for a parody type film. We need a moment to talk about Dale! We all need a buddy like Dale in our lives ... hell - I need a Dale in my life!! Tyler Labine stole the show (and my heart 😆) as the lovable, awkward hillbilly, and he even gets the beautiful blonde at the end. It uses the basic formula to most horror films these days, throws in a heavy helping of fun and the result is the most enjoyable 89 minutes I've had in a long time #sadbuttrue.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Even if you don't like those movies, this one will make you laugh as long as you don't mind a lot of gore. It turns the slasher genre upside-down in ways you won't expect that will keep you laughing throughout. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk bring the comedy and sympathy as the leads who fall victim to a series of unfortunate events. You should go see this movie. It has been sitting on a shelf for a year and a half because they didn't know how to market the movie.

The film keeps a steady pace both in body count and laughs as Dale and Tucker a couple of lovable hillbillies visit their ""vacation cabin"" in the woods. The film manages to successfully send up every slasher stereotype including hillbillies, college preps, local sheriffs, and insane killers. I viewed the film with five friends and it took all six of us to catalog all the physical comedy, dialog and subtle plot twists that writer/director managed to utilize. I suspect that I will find more when I get the opportunity to see the film for a second time.

Comedies these days, in my opinion, are not funny at all. The reason being, it's the same jokes over and over. You got your teen comedies in the vein of American Pie, Superbad, etc., etc. You've got your Romantic Comedies, truthfully they just aren't funny because it's the same stories over and over. Tucker and Dale vs Evil was a breath of fresh air. Similar to Shaun of the Dead, Tucker and Dale are a couple of friends thrown into a potentially dangerous situation and make you laugh about it the entire time.

I went and got a snack during the climax because it felt like I'd seen it 20 times already. Still worth watching though. This movie is a pretty good criticism of the assumption that country people are necessarily going to be crude, hostile and violent.

This film does the exact same thing in the most hilarious way: A bunch of teens are dying in the woods for just no reason at all, and Tucker and Dale (the sweet and utterly confused main characters, played by Labine and Tudyk) are just freaked about how sick it is.My absolute favorite character was Jesse Moss' Chad, whose sanity and logical thinking went for a walk in the forest and never came back. You see this guy just loosing it, running through the woods with an axe and you can't help but to compare him to a non-French Beauty and the Beast's Gaston. I hadn't heard of Labine before, but he had me the second he tried to pick up Allison in the gas station, like a giant teddy bear. I always love how Tudyk delivers just the amount of acting you need to know he's just plain awesome. Together, they were brilliant.It just looks bad, the FX are not ever there and still is genius.

You're purposely mislead into thinking that you will be following the pretty manicured 21-22 aged immature college kids around for the entirety of the movie, see black guy die first, premarital sex cases die 3rd and the virgin somehow surviving due to the magical whiffle bat they were carrying, but, no, the heroes of the movie are the rednecks just trying to get by. Its actually quite fun to watch, the kids are after them thanks to their hero leader who goes invader zim on them and decides his minions should just throw themselves at the poor guys, which is just fun to watch as dale and tucker keep having to come up with plausible reasons to everything the kids try to accomplish.8/10 bc i think there could have been more jokes and possibly better pacing and explanation with the kids",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

This made it quite funny how things started happening to them and they couldn't figure out why. Made it more of a comedy horror then a scary movie. In my opinion that is a lot more entertaining. The effects in it were well done especially for an indie movie. I'm surprised that it hasn't made more money then it did with it being so well done and loved by fans. I'd say the movie is a similar sort of genre as the British film Shaun of the Dead. You knew something was going to happen but not the way that this unfolded.

I'm not big into horror movies and neither into the farces like 'Scary Movie', which I always found to be to dull. But this here is quite something else. It takes a wonderful premise and explores it, without the consequences feeling over the top, which is a fine line to walk - thanks to Tudyk and Labine doing a wonderful job, it works though. The college kids work is not extraordinary, but enough to fill their part.The second half isn't quite as strong as the beginning, but it makes up for it with a nice twist at the end.It seems that movies like this unfortunately get overlooked, while mediocre work gets all hyped up to balance the lack of quality.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

This is what writing is all about, old-school, when writing actually mattered, over special effects. And there are plenty of those. It is rare that I actually praise an American film, only because we no longer care about writing. It's all about star power without chemistry or talent behind the scenes, just what might make a buck. And, clearly, even clear results do not stop ""the machine"" from producing utter crud. Relativity Media has bought this gem, but apparently has refused to market it ala Bounty Hunter. This is such a funny film that fits into Bromance, Comedy, Horror, maybe even Indie. Did I mention there's chemistry? Talent? Yup. All there. So, get on it, Relativity!

Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine always play characters that make you feel good and make you want to root for them. This movie was no different.

With strong acting all around, excellent directing and production, and a script that is solidly funny, this movie delivers laughs and horror in a quirky tongue in cheek.

The crowd in the  cinema went totally crazy about this film, they applauded and cheered  throughout the film and after the first positive reviews by bloggers  the screenings in Munich for example were sold out in just three hours  after starting the pre-selling.

270,jmbarton1991,"A Horror-Comedy That Cuts Like A Knife, Splits Your Sides, But Satisfies Like A Good Beer",10,5 February 2012,"I remember when I first heard of this movie. My best friend and I are Wal-Mart junkies, and we're constantly skimming the five-dollar bin for a good laugh at some terrible cinema. It just so happened that on one of these expeditions that I happened to cross the ""Just Released"" section, and there it sat; 'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil', a movie in which the two main characters looked like my best friend and I, was undoubtedly destined to be a campy, unintelligible attempt at a horror or horror-comedy, but would nonetheless be fun to pick at for humorous critical purposes. Time went by until the movie wandered onto my best bud's Netflix account. So we made a plan to get a pizza, chips, pop and sit back and watch this likely failure in film-making during a weekend (like we did for 'The Evil Dead', 'Rambo III', 'Hunt To Kill', and many others)And again I was taught the lesson of, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" 'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil' was anything but a terrible movie. In fact, it was pretty damn good. I definitely put it on my list of great comedy/parody films next to 'Shaun of the Dead', but too many people are making way too close a comparison, often misleading other viewers pre- viewing perspective. Allow me to break it down for you without spoiling too much of the film (aka I won't spoil anything important).Here's the general breakdown of the plot: You have two groups of characters here, Tucker and Dale, and some college kids. Tucker and Dale are two average guys who want to fix up a vacation home in the boonies of West Virginia. The college kids are out for a camp trip. When these two groups meet for the first time, the college kids instantly think 'Deliverance', and Tucker and Dale go about their business a little indignant about the treatment from the college kids, but overall unfazed. A second unintentional meet-up at a swimming and fishing hole results in one college girl accidentally getting hurt, Tucker and Dale trying to help her, and the college kids still thinking that 'Deliverance' is finally becoming a reality. From there, the wild accusations, assumptions, and hilarity ensues.First of all, it was the appearance of Tucker and Dale caught my attention originally. They were the spitting image of my best friend and I without a doubt, which was pretty much the sole reason we wanted to watch this film in the first place, with the exception of course of a good laugh for all the wrong reasons. Instantaneously, however, we soon began to realize that Tucker and Dale were actually very, very much like us in many ways. Now, I'm not saying that everyone will have the same comparison to make, but what I am saying is that the characters in this movie are delightful. Tucker and Dale are just two run-of-the-mill, blue- collar guys who are best buds with a predisposition towards awkward and clumsy behavior much like old greats Laurel and Hardy. Tucker is a hard worker and the hilariously unfortunate ""punching bag"" of the two, whereas Dale is looks like a bear, but he's the sweetest, most innocent, gentle guy imaginable. The second group of characters, the college kids, also had very likable qualities about them, unlike similar characters in many other horror/horror-comedy films. Whereas most horror films like to make college/teen-age characters seem like overtly-stereotypical horny belligerent delinquents with a penchant for misbehavior, these college kids were, well, regular college kids! They just wanted a camp-out to have a good time and maybe sneak a beer or two and tell some spooky stories around a camp-fire, but in the midst of chaos become quick to judge and non-observational. One college girl even assumes the position of an average, intelligent girl, who is not in this for pure sex appeal and to be a cattle to the slaughter. All of these elements were completely refreshing, to say the least.Second, the cinematography was excellent. Nothing completes a campy horror flick like lackluster film, terrible camera handling, lighting, and scenery. This film had the appeal of HD, and good camera work and lighting. The special FX were also something to be proud of, because they certainly kept a grip on the ""gore-rror"" of this movie without undercooking or going too over-the-top.Third, and the big one (for me, anyway), the story was excellent, and the script dialogue was also very nice. Many people are comparing it to 'Shaun of the Dead', the undoubted Prince of Cult Horror/Horror-Comedy. You have got to remember, though, that these are two COMPLETELY different films; Shaun deals fairly strictly with zombie flicks and dry British humor, whereas Tucker and Dale covers (really) a small plethora of horror, drawing from 'Deliverance' (Tucker and Dale as Hillbillies in West Virginia), 'Scream' (the college kids in more ways than one), and the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (the TRUE horror in the film), and it is also fairly American in its humorous backwoods comedy. What they do share, however, is their film type (horror-comedy/parody), the lovable characters, scripts that sparkled with a dusting of genius and worked perfectly for every character, and that both films have a little heart and morality to them. One should also note that 'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil' is in fact a comedy, so viewers shouldn't really walk into it with a grade book and a stiff back. Many of the elements of the film ARE blown way out of proportion to both look ridiculous and make you laugh, but it does this so very delicately where everything still fits in place, unlike the incredibly silly screwball antics of, say, the 'Scary Movie' series.In conclusion, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil proved to the world, once again, that you can't spell ""slaughter"" without ""laughter."" A definite must-see addition to any horror junkie's collection.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

It's hysterical, clever, original, and at moments even touching. Everything about this movie is spot on: the story premise, the characters, the dialogue, the pacing, the effects. I could watch this movie a hundred times, and never find a single flaw.Best friends Tucker and Dale are a couple of lovable and kind-hearted backwoods hillbillies, working on fixing up an old creepy, cabin and making it they're vacation home. Their plans are unfortunately interrupted by a bunch of preppy, college kids who have seen too many horror movies. As one of their group is hurt, and the two rednecks run to her rescue, her friends mistakenly think that she's been abducted. Hilarity, mayhem, and dismemberment ensue, as the college kids set out to ""save"" the girl from her ""captors.""If you are looking for an original film with great characters, a bit of well executed gore, and laugh-out-loud moments, this is definitely the movie for you. I can't say enough good things about it. Everyone I have recommended it to has had the same reaction I did.

I've seen some horror comedy movies which I liked and some ones that were just pure stupidity to them. Based on the trailer I thought OK, this was going be just a couple of rednecks in the woods making mistakes...but there is great character development in the movie and a great message in the movie that makes you feel good while you are watching the film. I don't want to give away any spoilers but lets just say if you see this movie you will laugh a lot and you will come out feeling good at the end of it. There is a lot of gore in the movie which just adds to the film rather then take away from it. Yes Tucker and Dale are hillbillies but they are far from the most ignorant(with the exception of why the deaths around them are occurring) characters in the film.

274,t-17186,Irony in Horror,10,3 June 2019,"Tucker and Dale vs Evil is by far the most ironic horror movie in this current century. Similar to movies like the Scary Movie series, we see Alan Tudyk as Tucker, and Tyler Labine as Dale, two hillbillies who give a great laugh along with an interesting story.
The story everyone in the film knows of is the Memorial Day Weekend Massacre, when a group of Hillbillies brutally murdered clueless college teenagers in the woods for their pure entertainment. It's a story that haunts many, especially those who lost someone in it. Enter Tucker and Dale, two average Hillbillies who simply drink beer and want to renovate the cabin in the woods (yes a film reference) they bought for a summer home. Follow suit comes along a group of stupid teenagers who see them renovating the land with many potential murder weapons that weren't meant to be murder weapons. Being clueless, stupid, and straight up pretentious, they decide they must defeat their ""dangerous"" foes for the greater good. This leads to a series of ridiculous deaths that are head scratchers, but simply too funny not to laugh at.
Aspects of this film that make you enjoy it most is the plot itself, along with fun dialogue and great characters. As described earlier, the plot leaves you with a fun story that integrates horror movie aspects without having any actual horror in it. You see references from movies like Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw, and many more. It creates a sense of respect from the Director Eli Craig, who's known to be an avid Horror movie genre fan. Along with the plot comes great dialogue, which is delivered almost effortlessly by the main characters of the film. Speaking of main characters, we have four great characters: Tucker (played by Alan Tudyk), Dale (played by Tyler Labine), Alison (played by Katrina Bowden), and finally, Chad (played by Jesse Moss). These four are supported with other characters who are great at playing roles of stupid college kids, which helps find the balance of the cast in the end.
A movie with a low budget that simply wanted to pay homage to many other horror films by creating a plot so stupid, that it's great. Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a film to watch with good friends and have a great laugh at without actually getting scared, but also being able to acknowledge the fun in it. It is a film you will likely enjoy.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

276,cheetoturtle,I was expecting something bad,8,23 December 2019,"When I was browsing through Netflix with my brother and we came across this movie, my only reason for watching it was because I thought it was going to be so bad we were going to get a kick out of it. I thought it was going to be too cheesy, I thought the humor was going to be dumb, and I thought I was going to have typical bad horror movie tropes.However, I was COMPLETELY WRONG.The main characters are extremely lovable, the acting (for the main cast) is actually good, the writing is clever, the ending was really sweet and heartwarming, I laughed a LOT watching it, and every horror movie trope ever is completely turned on it's head. There were even plot twists I didn't see coming, and the villain is actually more believable than most I've seen.My favorite aspect was the relationship between the two main characters. I thought they had great chemistry and the scenes focusing on their friendship were just so sweet and made me more invested in the movie than I could have ever expected.Basically, this movie took me completely by surprise.Though there are some obviously low-budget parts, and some of the minor characters acting isn't the best, and a lot of things that happen are really ridiculous, I can look past these issues and say this movie pleasantly surprised me. I only wish it were more popular, because I think a lot of people would really enjoy it. :)",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

279,Roman-Thaler,Lacks in the most important thing - it's not very funny,5,22 February 2012,"So, usually my personal opinion coincides with the User Rating on IMDb, but this time i really have to disagree. It's somehow a mystery to me, how nearly everybody says this was a great flick with good laughs.Of course, it is meant to be a parody, but the events and actions occurring in the movie were just too unbelievable and ridiculous too feel comfortable whilst watching. Nearly nothing in this film could ever happen like that in real life, it was just too absurd. It's like you are watching it and got to say repeatedly ""Oh yea, of course"", ""Oh come on"". Like in a bad cliché action movie. Or in other words, if there were any laughs, they would have rather been due to the stupidity of the movie. I didn't see the great and original ""funniness"", that so many others may have seen. It was rather dull to me.The same goes for the characters. How can I like them, when they act completely strange and unbelievable? I couldn't identify with any a little bit. I can't like characters who doesn't seem human to me. Of course the characters show human qualities, which are even pointed out in the movie, but in the whole they were pretty awkward, unbelievable and strangely acting. I felt so uncomfortable with them. ""ARENT YOU HUMAN PEOPLE? WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS??"", thats what was on my mind. And that's true for all of the characters occurring in the movie.On top of that, the movie was predictable as hell. The events weren't surprising, nor excited nor anything. Just waited for them too occur like i had been expecting them. There was nothing special about it, expect the thing that, like i had already said a hundred times, the scenes were completely unbelievable. It was just somehow boring.It were just those things that ruined the movie for me. The actors themselves didn't do a bad job, especially the main actors played their awkward roles relatively satisfying. I also liked the idea behind the movie and it definitely had some potential, which sadly wasn't used. For that: 5 out of 10.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

I find the movie making process fascinating and watching a movie before the effects are added is quite entertaining in itself. But despite being completely unfinished sfx wise, i couldn't of loved this absolute gem of a movie anymore. It's gore, comedy and heartwarming all in one. The basis of the movie is college kids camping in the back woods and mistakenly thinking that two lovable holidaying hillbillies (Tucker and Dale) are psychotic axe wielding killers (stereotyping). And of course are out to get them.After saving one of the kids from drowning and taking her back to their holiday home (shack) comedy and gore ensues. As Tucker and Dale wait for the college kids to come collect their friend, the college kids are convinced she's been kidnapped and will be killed.

But well, i like to tell you that it was the best think i could ever done in the last days because the movie is extraordinary, the concept is not very original but the role of the characters and how the history unfolds in very comic situations made this a very enjoyable watch. I personally loved the characters Tucker and Dale, and Dale's evil counterpart was very scary from the beginning, very young actor with a lot of potential. The cinematography was great, camera rolls, pans, tilts, everything was there, even never before seen POV's over the trees, i suppose they've used Stilts to achieve this, i really recommend this film for everyone looking to have a big time laugh, the film is absolutely enjoyable and may be in the memory for decades, i hope.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
284,iggzy,A Cult Classic Waiting to Happen,9,11 April 2010,"So I was lucky enough to get to see this as my first movie at my first festival ever, the Dallas International Film Festival(DIFF) Honestly, this movie was a genius comedy, parodying classic horror to levels that could be considered even better then the likes of Shaun of the Dead.Truly it is a perfect Indie movie, and the fact that it is only on the festival circuit is a shame. It has the celebrity power of Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine leading the film in a comic tour de force as well as quite a few lesser known young actors acting opposite. Also, the direction of the new, but highly committed director Eli Craig shines as he directs the film he co-wrote and has been trying to get made for 4 years, and that love of the material shines.The humor and jokes just play beautifully with how the characters are made and the deaths always pay off. I was lucky enough to get a Q & A with Craig as well as meet with him afterwords and gain further insight into this movie that I already very much loved. He stated how some of he always saw this film as a comedy, not a horror film or even a parody of horror films, and as such one thing the big studios that wouldn't produce it had a problem with was the humor in the deaths. The fact however is that the way they are produced in the scenes and how the actors react just make each scene perfect.In truth, this film fully deserves a nationwide release. It will likely still gain this Cult Classic level with that as it fits into the mold perfectly just as the likes of Shaun of the Dead did. It would be a shame for this film to end up like Boondock Saints and having to rely on DVD to get around and known as it is just what the movie industry needs.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
285,chevybilly2001,Wonderfully smart and witty,10,23 July 2011,"I have been on an epic journey to find a companion piece for one of my favorite horror/comedies for years, a search that has been tormented with poorly made and abysmally acted b-rate flicks that could torment the soul with their mediocrity and poor cinematography.Since seeing Behind The Mask: The Rise Of Leslie Vernon I have fallen in love with the black humor style that doesn't quite make one think of movies like Very Bad Things so much as a very dramatic Monty Python sketch. Worse still is trying to find one that is smartly written and has acting that at the very least can be considered on par with a sci-fi original movie. Tucker and Dale VS. Evil far exceeds the bill.Lets not get crazy here and say the movie is packed with award winning actors or special effects but for a cast consisting of mostly unknowns (sans the titular Tucker and Dale of course) the level of acting far exceeds expectations. Not only is it better than one would expect it gets better the closer to the end one travels, compare the scene early in at the gas station with the hunt at the end and you will see a particular inhaler-using characters' acting grow leaps and bounds, in fact this early salvo of college co-ed banter is quickly dismissed as possibly a test shot when you compare the kids to what they will become a mere 30 minutes later.The humor is relentless and insanely funny, the use of villain shots, for Dale particularly, is interspersed beautifully throughout. At times one could imagine that if you knew nothing of the soft hearted hillbillys you would certainly think they where on a vendetta to murder you. I grew so attached to Dale that I actually wished he could be protected from having to witness the senseless, and extremely funny, violence around him.Combine an evening of Behind The Mask with some Tucker and Dale VS Evil and you will laugh your ass off, and maybe think a bit differently when looking at the bad guy in any classic horror movie.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

The actors playing Tucker and Dale are very compelling and believable. Their charm really makes the film and you care about their story. The movie is basically a farce or a comedy of errors with each error resulting in a gruesome death. While the manner of the deaths is so over the top as to be funny, the biggest laughs come from the dialog. ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil"" excels at both physical comedy (the chainsaw scene for example) and verbal (explaining the situation to the police). Great movie.

It's obviously a low budget flick, but that isn't really a factor at all. Actually, I think it lends a certain amount of charm to the films quirky atmosphere. I can't help but think that if I were to make a horror film myself, that it would be much different. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch with friends, or even alone, stop right here!

It was like watching Scary Movie 4 again but with even less funny jokes, it was that bad. If you feel like you have nothing to do and you are planning on watching this movie, don't. Instead you should just stare at your ceiling since it is much more enjoyable and it doesn't make your brain rot.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
289,bill-kercher,A must see. Instant cult classic.,9,14 February 2011,"I did not have many expectations when I sat through this gem of a movie. This movie takes the horror/comedy genre to new levels. The plot is fairly simple, Lots of misunderstood situations that take place between Dale and Tucker and their fix-ur-upper vacation home, and some overly critical, unstable college kids. Very original script, good acting (Tucker and Dale are fantastic), and clever direction. How can a brilliant movie like this not make it to the big screen, yet movies like Season of the witch, Skyline, and Gulliver's Travels do. If you want to laugh till milk shoots out your nose, watch this movie. Should be on everyone's must-see list.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
290,liverocity,"Best ""B"" Movie EVER",10,14 February 2011,"Its saddens me that there is no US distributor for this. I happened across a workprint for it it and loved it. Someone needs to release this movie in the US and on Blu Ray so I can buy a copy with the VFX actually in it. Well worth the watch. And I'll give you no spoilers. It is definitely one of those movies that is made to be a B movie on purpose. I think with the proper advertising this could make it in theaters, way funnier than Zombieland. Its just one of those really fun slasher flicks. Its like one of those movies that is OK for the whole family. I don't see it as one of those movies that would cause nightmares as it is all really funny. Its also not one of those movies that make you feel dumber since I've known college kids that are about as stupid as the kids in the movie.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
291,discombobulated_uber,Great Movie!,10,19 March 2011,"I had a chance to view this movie, and I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Dale & Tucker vs. Evil is pure genius. You can not compare this movie to Shaun of the Dead or any other Comedy/Horror film. It is in its own genre. Purely original, purely great from start to finish. I recommend this movie to ANYONE with a sense of humor, and also to those without, as this movie may create one.I was very impressed as I, like others, had little hope for this movie when I started watching. I figured it would be another failed attempt at a Comedy/Horror flick. But I was blown away by the originality, and humor that this movie portrays. Like I stated before I recommend this movie to ANYONE looking for a laugh. I give this movie a 10.5/10.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
292,eric-lutts,Never would've thought this movie would've been this great.,8,2 May 2011,"I had no expectations going into the movie but I can honestly say I haven't laughed out loud at anything else like I did with this one in a long time. The combo of Alan Tudyk (Tucker) and Tyler Labine (Dale) was as good as it gets. They played their characters without missing a beat. Dale's crush, Ali (Katrina Bowden), played her part pretty well too, but left a little to be desired. All in all I was pleasantly surprised. The rest of the cast was as expected. Shotty, first-time or small-time actors that finally got the chance to play a role with some decent stars in a B-movie that just might get them some publicity. I realize this movie never made it to theaters, but I honestly can't understand why. If the budget was as low as I think, this should have been in theaters for sure. The movie definitely gets a thumbs up for the comedy in it. Tudyk was great just like he is in all of his roles, and Labine never let me down once. I've been a fan of his since ""Reaper"" and I'm just glad to see him working again. I really think that this is one of the better films I've seen so far this year. If you're looking for some comedy and a lot of guts and gore, this is definitely your flick. If you're looking for something with a love story and a happy ending too, you've found it in this one as well. At the end of the day I give this an 8 out of 10.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
293,ryanumber1-59-27371,Awesome! I crapped my pants....,10,21 May 2011,"Amazing, and stuff! Funny and things! Sad, never! Silly for sure! Hungry, maybe? Best movie ever??? I'm not sure... Yes, a bit hungry... A movie, yes, I think. Ummmm...ten lines. That seems to be quite a few lines to write about a movie, considering I have to change my pants because I crapped myself laughing so hard. Sound of Music has nothing on this film, nor does the movie The Color Purple. This movie ranks up there with Rocky, and The Muppets go to Outer Space. I would highly recommend this movie to people that have a sense of humor, or mental problems...OK maybe not mental problems, but at least people with a low enough IQ to laugh at some sill stuff, but with an IQ high enough to control ones bowel movements.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
294,manteiv2001,"A Great Original, No remake or book to film here.",10,24 May 2011,"The word really needs to get out about this. This movie was a sigh of relief of seeing a new look at horror. It is a comedy, a great one at that, about seeing a college camping weekend gone wrong through the eyes of the ""killers"". It is a great plot/story line in how the ""bad guy"" is being seen in the wrong way. I don't want to spoil it but it is a must see. There are so many good things to say about this movie. The special effects were there, the great retention of the jokes as the movie went on and the perception people would have of the killers and how it is played out made this movie a top 20 comedy for me. If you like to get away from Hollywood doing things that have already been done and you enjoy comedy, this is the movie for you.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
295,ravis0291,lots of fun!!!!,10,26 August 2013,"Please watch this movie without having any previous knowledge(like watching trailers). This is one of d best movies in the comedy/horror genre. Well, it doesn't have the well known prominent actors but each one of them has done their part in d best possible way especially Katrina Bowden and the character ""Dale"".Sure will bring tears in Ur eyes!!!!!!!!And of course its a movie that you can watch with your entire family. If you like this movie then i recommend you to watch ""Shaun of the dead"" which has a similar genre.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
296,BigTriX,A truly remarkable film for a B class movie!,10,1 October 2011,"The first time I watched Tucker & Dale vs Evil, I cried and cried and cried with laughter.I absolutely love horror and never been a true fan for comedy horror, but this, this has broke than boundary.So cleverly made and very well directed. Mishap after mishap you are on the floor laughing, it really is that funny.My girlfriend HATES! any form of horror with a passion, but she loved this as the thriller/horror aspect is balanced perfectly with the humour.This is the best low budget movie I have ever seen and I would advise every one of you to check it out!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
297,captainbones15,Other movies wish they were this awesome.,10,1 December 2011,"I watched the trailer for Tucker & Dale vs Evil and immediately knew that I had to watch it. (An enthusiastic recommendation from a friend didn't hurt, either.)The set-up is typical for any slasher film: A group of sexy college kids are heading out into the woods to camp, drink, smoke, get naked, and just be generally debaucherous. They get a scare along the way, however, when they run into two deranged hillbillies at a convenience store.And that's where the typical slasher film ends and Tucker & Dale begins.This movie is gory, funny, and original, putting a spin on the conventional slasher film. Tudyk and Labine never miss a beat as the tragically (and hilariously) confused Tucker and Dale, and it's damn near impossible to tear your eyes away from Katrina Bowden (as the ""damsel in distress,"" Allison).Do yourself a favor and watch this movie AT LEAST once. You'll thank yourself later.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
298,pennylane-260-202776,"NOT a horror fan, laughed like a hyena through the whole thing!",10,8 January 2012,"Seriously, I am not a fan of horror or spoof movies. I only ended up watching this movie because my husband was in the other room, cracking up and I had to see what was so darn hilarious. I'm glad I didn't miss too much of this movie, because I can't remember how long it's been since I laughed this hard at a movie of any kind. I didn't want it to end. The acting was great, and the material was priceless. Often times in this type of movie, the ""ridiculous"" situations and people are kind of an insult to your intelligence. In this one, they managed to do it just right. This movie deserves some recognition and I hope they get some.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
299,Ekensai,If you liked Shaun of The Dead or Hot Fuzz you need to watch this.,10,21 January 2012,"I was at my local blockbuster(movie rental service) when i was first recommended this movie, i passed it by because it was an unknown and how much i regret that.I was reminded when i was browsing LOVEFiLM on the xbox that it might be worth a watch. This comedy horror is up there with the classic Shaun of The Dead.Its starts slowly building the characters and bringing the story together. This passed me by at first but looking back it was a really effective at giving you detail on the characters. The movie doesn't get really hilarious until about half way through but after that point you just don't stop laughing at how the movie unfolds. The one-liners are hilarious.The whole concept is genius and the director/co-writer deserves recognition in making sure this movie has gotten out after numerous blocks. It really deserved a theatre release. Im writing this review in hope someone will decide to watch it because it really is worth your time if you enjoyed other similar films like Shaun of the Dead it wont disappoint.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
300,EightyFeetTall,Hooray! It's the Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre In Reverse!,9,7 January 2012,"This is one of the funniest ""spoof"" horror flicks I've seen in a while. At first, I expected this film to trod familiar ground, only in a comic way, but not only was it funny, it flew in the face of my expectations! I was pleasantly surprised to find that old situation reversed in a really funny way, and from that point on, the plot kept moving, and the pacing was suitable in the way that successful b- movies always are: laughs and suspense are succinctly blended, there is sympathy (or even empathy for those from the southern US states who feel less than human some days due to prejudice) for the main characters, and the main interior setting is detailed and well dressed. The outdoors are beautifully presented as well, revealing that quietude maintained by forests when the humans are gone (or doing horrible things to one another).There are a few clichés, but they're small ones, and the main stereotypes are turned on their heads for a wonderful comedic horror show. Long live the Bs!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
301,HebrewzHammer,Awesome Movie!!!!,10,11 April 2010,"I just watched this movie at the International Film Festival and it is AMAZING!!! Think a cross between ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Wrong Turn""! The acting is excellent, the story is awesome, the special f/x are spectacular, everything about this movie is just Awesome!!! This movie is almost more of a comedy with some horror in it rather than a scary horror movie. I guarantee you will rolling on the floor laughing during this movie. Although it may be a ""small"" independent movie, there is nothing about this movie to hint that it wasn't a huge multi-million dollar blockbuster. It was shot using the RED camera at 4K (that is a resolution of 4096×2160!!!), so the video and audio quality are superb. This is a must see, but it needs everybody's help to get distribution or else no one will be able to see it!!! So tell everyone about this movie and demand that it gets released!!!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
302,chocolate_milk3,Good Review,7,28 May 2013,"The movie had good use of the pan, boom and flat-angle shots through out the movie leading to any easy watch and making it easier to understand the movie through out the film. The use of special effects was excellent to portray the dead bodies like the one going through the wood chipper. The plot of the forest and the pond or lake was good for the outdoor hillbilly setting. I feel like I have seen the forest in this movie in other scary movies like Sh-rooms. The plot is like the one of Sh- rooms where they are running through the woods to escape a killer. The movie was a good watch because it wasn't to boring and keep you in the movie and wanting to see more an more of the movie. I'm hoping for a sequel.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
303,s_sutton01,Hilarious from start to finish. Must watch.,10,25 June 2021,"I can't believe it took me so long to watch this movie. I avoided it like a B-Rated, dumb, lack of plot plague for a long time. Until someone pointed out how good this movie actually is and the premise of what it's actually about.I must say, I was wrong in my initial assumption and will not judge a movie by it's cover again. This movie is well executed and hilarious. I laughed so hard. It's gory and funny. My only regret is there is not another as part of a series franchise.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil

Allison, Chad, Chloe, Chuck, Jason, Naomi, Todd, Mitch and Mike are going camping in West Virginia. While at a gas station, they encounter Tucker and Dale, two well-meaning hillbillies who have just bought the vacation home of their dreams: a run-down lakefront cabin, deep in the woods. On Tucker's advice, Dale tries to talk to Allison, but because of his inferiority complex and appearance, he only scares her and her friends.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
305,bgooden72,If you need a good laugh unplug your brain for an hour and a half or so and give this a try.,8,2 September 2018,Flipping through Netflix and just decided to check out this movie. I was expecting much actually thought that I wouldn't even finish watching it. But to my surprise this was a pretty good movie. It's basically a spoof on teenagers vs hillbillies in woods. But Tucker and Dale are two good natured that so bright buddies going to their fixer-upper vocation home when encounter some spoiled and judgemental college students camping in the same area. During the two groups first encounter the college kids assume that Tucker and Dale are the stereotypical redneck serial killers. From there a series of misunderstandings results in some gory yet hilarious results. Overall the movie takes an overused premise and flips on its head. So if you need a good laugh unplug your brain for an hour and a half or so and give this a try.,Tucker and Dale vs Evil

307,jrosey16-1,So much fun!,8,26 August 2011,"I have read a lot of the posts for this film and I am trying to figure out for the people that do not like this movie, what they like. Yes, movies are subjective and yes, everyone is entitled to their opinion,but with that said, sometimes I think people just like to talk for the sake of talking. This film is nothing more than entertaining at its finest! It is a an excellent parody of horror films that actually has something to say. Don't judge a book by its cover. The acting for a film like this is top notch. Taylor Labine is about to blow up and Alan Tudyk is as solid as they come. The movie moves a long at a fast pace, its funny, gory and unpredictable. So, like I said, I am curious to those that do not like this film, what you consider good. Is this the best thing ever, of course not but when Hollywood is churning out crap after crap, you would think the general public would applaud a film like Tucker and Dale!",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
308,spankmespicy,WARNING SPOILERS!!!!! tru,8,21 June 2018,"My experience with Tucker And Dale V.S. Evil began as a horror movie binge I began since the time around halloween. Each night, I would choose a random horror movie or horror series, and watch it that night. Initially, the movie seemed goofy, and lacked a sense of story. I caught on later that the director intentionally meant for the 'story' to be a mock film on every other scary movie in the industry. It started off with Tucker and Dale driving in the sticks (the woods) talking about their new vacation home, it moved on to a few college kids talking about their vacation, and one of them (Chad) talks about how bad ""Hillbillies"" were. The group of college students also plan to hang around the same area as Tucker and Dale for the weekend. Yet again their paths cross at the lake while Tucker and Dale were fishing the kids were cliff diving, they take the blonde haired woman to nurse her back to health, judgements follow, and the college students try to kill them, and manage to kill themselves in the process. Chad ends up dead in the old woodshop, as it turns out Chad's dad was a hillbilly. I enjoyed the fact that throughout the movie, the roles were switched. The hillbillies were actually the good guys, while normally, they would be labeled as murderers.",Tucker and Dale vs Evil
