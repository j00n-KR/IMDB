0,MartinHafer,"It's kind of like ""Jane Eyre""....really.",8,12 March 2012,"The film is a story about manners--very, very, very proper and stuffy British manners during the Edwardian era. As a result of convention, Lucy (Carter) and George (Sands) are kept apart.Partway through watching ""A Room With a View"", I realized that, believe it or not, the underlying theme is the same as you'll find in ""Jane Eyre""....seriously. Both concern social conventions and morality versus happiness and romantic passion. In the case of Jane, her love (Mr. Rochester) was not technically able to marry her and so she ran off--and lived, for a time, with a man in training to be a missionary and his family. The missionary had no passion at all for Jane but proposed--a marriage of convenience and intellect. Should she choose this good man or live with a man already married (Rochester)--albeit, his marriage was clearly a fraud perpetrated on him. Likewise, in ""A Room With a View"", Helena Bonham Carter's character must choose between a more worldly (and rather non-religious) Julian Sands or the incredibly stodgy and respectable fiancé (Daniel Day-Lewis). Either a marriage of predictability and convention or a marriage with passion, and, perhaps, irrespectability are her apparent choices. Now I am NOT complaining that the themes are the same...after all, ""Jane Eyre"" is one of my very favorite books (and is MUCH better than the movie versions).Some things to look for in this film--the gorgeous views of Florence, the lovely score and the funny (but very explicit) skinny-dipping scene. Clever and enjoyable...but also perhaps a bit slow due to its commentary about manners.",A Room with a View
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautiful, near-perfect film adaptation of a wonderful book",9,28 March 2010,"The book ""A Room with a View"" is immensely charming, filled with warmth, humour, beautiful sophisticated dialogues and just wonderful to read really. This film adaptation is nigh-on perfect, with rock-solid acting, nuanced direction and gorgeous visuals.First off, as I've kind of said already, the film is gorgeous to look at, with exquisite Italian scenery, beautiful costumes and stunning cinematography. The direction is sensitive and very nuanced, the sort of direction you would find in a film like say ""The Remains of the Day"". The music is like the visuals, absolutely gorgeous. Beethoven's sonatas, La Rondine and Gianni Schicci are put to perfect use and enhanced the scenes they featured in. Though I do think Kiri TeKanawa has sung better, her performance of O Mio Babbino Caro was good but the conducting was a bit too fast and there are occasional mispronunciations of the Italian words.The screenplay is beautiful, funny, sophisticated, at best like poetry, very like the dialogues in the book. Even more importantly, the film stays true to the book's spirit. And the acting is pretty much perfect. Helen Bonham Carter is sublime as Lucy, a performance of innocence and spirit and came across as touching. Maggie Smith is as wonderful as ever as Charlotte Bartlett, Julian Sands is a handsome George Emerson and Daniel-Day Lewis is a somewhat touching yet suitably contrived Cecil Vyse, a man you sort of love to hate. Judi Dench also is outstanding as Eleanor Lavish and Denholm Elliot is memorable as Mr Emerson.Overall, a beautiful adaptation, not quite perfect, being occasionally too slow, but I recommend it highly. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",A Room with a View
2,bkoganbing,Class Distinction,8,21 March 2009,"It took about 80 years for E.M. Forster's A Room With A View to come to the screen with a full blown first rate cast and an expensive production that captures the Edwardian age of manners that Forster was so critical of. As a closeted gay man throughout his 90 plus years, Forster saw as few others the hypocrisies of the age. What Ismail Merchant and James Ivory best succeeded in doing is capturing the idea of class so well. It's certainly present in America, but not to the extent in Europe. And it's not just money, Forster makes that very clear.Young Helena Bonham-Carter is on holiday in Italy, properly chaperoned of course by her cousin Maggie Smith, a woman who observes the strict proprieties. Like tourists today, they like seeing the sights, but want to mingle with their own. When with some other English travelers, Bonham-Carter complains that her rooms lack a view, fellow travelers Denholm Elliott and his son Julian Sands offer to exchange their rooms.This is taking liberties thinks Smith, but they do it anyway. Later on though when Sands steals a kiss from Helena that tears it. The two go back to Great Britain where Helena is being courted by the earnest and wealthy, but dull as dishwater Daniel Day Lewis.Of course Elliott and Sands do reappear in her life and Helena has a big choice to make about staying with the ultra-respectable Lewis or a romance with Sands.Lewis is great in his part so respectable it positively hurts to watch him. A far cry from the brawling gang leader in Gangs of New York, he and young Rupert Everett as Bonham-Carter's brother are my favorites in the cast.A Room With A View took home three Academy Awards. As you might expect Art&Set Design and Costume Design for so accurately reflecting the era of the story which is the film's greatest strength and Best Screenplay adapted from another medium, that being Forster's novel. Denholm Elliott and Maggie Smith were in the running for Best Supporting Actor and Actress. And the film was also nominated for Best Picture and James Ivory for Best Director. I didn't like A Room With A View as much as the films made from Maurice and A Passage To India. Forster was so much more passionate in his story telling in those works. You never know just why Elliott and Sands were so unrespectable, they seemed like perfectly decent people, certainly with enough money to afford an Italian vacation. I think that's what Forster's idea was also, but it was not as passionate a work as the other two I've mentioned.",A Room with a View
3,SnoopyStyle,nicely made,7,2 March 2016,"Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) and her chaperon cousin Charlotte Bartlett (Maggie Smith) are in Italy. They're disappointed with the view from their rooms. Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliott) is with his son George (Julian Sands) and offers to switch their rooms. Charlotte refuses due to conventional manners but Reverend Beebe changes her mind. Lucy is shocked by the wild Italian world and she faints witnessing a bloody fight. George comes to the rescue. Later, George kisses Lucy which could lead to a scandal. Lucy returns home and accepts the marriage proposal from snobby proper gentleman Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis).It is a beautiful literary movie. It's the theatrical debut of Helena Bonham Carter and she delivers a great performance. This is not necessarily my type of movie. The story moves too slowly for me. A lot of the emotions are hidden. It's a nice start of a string of hits for Merchant-Ivory. I give it full marks for spotless workmanship.",A Room with a View
4,mark.waltz,Sex among the British nobles with Italian passions,9,4 August 2014,"You too might want to scream out, ""Hush, hush sweet Charlotte!"" after the tenth time cousin Maggie Smith sticks her foot in it. For the companion to the lovely Helena Bonham Carter to be so socially backwards while the rest of her family is so earthy adds great charm to Smith's Oscar Nominated performance. This is also an opportunity to see Dame Maggie working with her good friend, the future Dame Judi Dench, seen in the early sequences as a rather Bohemian writer.Carter and Smith are on vacation in Italy and the moment Maggie views the lack of a view from their window, she is up in arms. Cockney Denholm Elliott offers to switch his and his son Julian Sands room for theirs which has a view, and uppity Maggie declines, shocked that he would have the audacity to even speak to them, something she believes that the lower classes shouldn't do. But easy going Helena isn't so proud and graciously accepts, going as far as spending time with the educated Sands and growing fond of him in spite of the fact that she's already engaged to the stuffy Daniel Day Lewis.The romantic intrigue continues at Carter's summer home back in England where she must make some quick decisions in regards to stuffy Daniel. Elliott and Sands come for weekend where Carter's charming brother Rupert Graves is introduced, revealing a free spirit and almost Bohemian nature between the two siblings. This also creates a bond between Sands and Graves which borders on the homo-erotic, especially in a sudden nude scene that also includes the local minister Simon Callow.As the classes clash and Carter becomes torn between love and obligation, the film moves from drawing room comedy into social drama. The beauty of the dramatic parts is that it never looses the mood established in the first half. Everybody gets a chance to shine, but they are forced to step back every time Maggie Smith re-appears on the scene. Even when she has an argument with a cab driver over the cost, Smith tears the roof off.Elliott shows that just because someone is identified as lower class does mean that they lack in class. You can see how the gentleness transfered from father to son and how the desire to be something more than what he would have been a century earlier has inspired Sand's jovial character. Lewis headed to stardom quickly after this surprise hit, and Carter made a successful entrance into films with this and the same year's ""Lady Jane"", although this is a far cry from her more recent films under the direction of Tim Burton. Smith's character reminded me of a more comical version of Lady Rosamund, Smith's character's daughter on ""Downton Abbey"".",A Room with a View
5,classicsoncall,"""You must forgive me if I say stupid things. My brain has gone to pieces.""",7,11 June 2018,"The film has the sense and sensibility of a Jane Austen novel, but this story was based on a work by E.M. Forster. With Merchant Ivory Productions, one expects a near flawless representation of Edwardian England and the picture delivers on that score. The period detail and costuming is exquisite and pleasing to the eye, though many of the characters have a tendency to chafe, being strictly upper crust and all. None more so than the boorish Cecil Vyse, who one would be tempted to do a double take upon realizing it was Daniel Day-Lewis in the role. A perfect characterization of British snobbery, Cecil lacks even the most basic elements of human compassion. When he gets the big brush off from his fiance Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter), the best he can muster is a hand shake to say good-bye. This may be the only time I've seen Helena Bonham Carter in what might be considered a 'normal' type role, what with such eclectic performances as the Red Queen in ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Bellatrix Lestrange in the Harry Potter movies. For me, this was different, and showed a different side of her ability, even if she seemed a bit 'plain'. I may not have made that come out right but you know what I mean. The other performers in this Edwardian tale are all up to the task, though that waterhole scene of the three men chasing after each other in the resplendent buff might give one the wrong impression. Fortunately the good natured Miss Honeychurch managed to laugh it off without embarrassment. The picture may move a little slow for some folks, but for the tea and sympathy crowd, there's much to enjoy here. It's done at a relaxed pace and allows one to indulge in the sophistication of an era in transition.",A Room with a View
6,gavin6942,Pretty Entertaining,7,29 April 2013,"When Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) and chaperone Charlotte Bartlett find themselves in Florence with rooms without views, fellow guests Mr. Emerson and son George (Julian Sands) step in to remedy the situation.I watched this film knowing nothing about it because I wanted to see a Daniel Day-Lewis movie, and then I saw that Helena Bonham Carter and Julian Sands were in it. Carter was unknown to me until the 1990s, so it was a pleasant surprise to see her in such an early role. Sands is the one who steals the show, and it is a pity that it seems his career never hit the level it should.Day-Lewis is always good, though he plays a rather secondary role here. It would be hard to compare this to any of his other great performances, because certainly they overshadow this one.",A Room with a View
7,jboothmillard,A Room with a View,7,19 September 2005,"I remember seeing this costume drama one before, but the only bit I can ever remember is the nudity sequence that I questioned being rated PG, a second viewing was in order, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director James Ivory (Howards End, The Remains of the Day). Basically, set in the early 1900's, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) is the young English woman accompanied by her chaperon Charlotte Bartlett (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Dame Maggie Smith) on a trip to Florence, Italy, and they insist on having each a room with a view. They get help from tourist Mr. Emerson (Indiana Jones's Oscar and BAFTA nominated Denholm Elliott) and his son George (Julian Sands) who don't mind swapping rooms, and Lucy meets the eccentric young son again out and about, they seem to get on very well. It is apparent that she is developing feelings for him, and the Emersons join the two women back to England, where Lucy's current partner Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis) waits for her. Of course when Cecil asks her to marry him, which she interestingly agrees to, she now has a choice, she needs to decide whether to follow her head and marry her new fiancé, or follow her heart and be with George. In amongst this main story, we do see other small things going on with other characters, such as Charlotte's friendship with novelist Eleanor Lavish (BAFTA winning Dame Judi Dench), and The Reverend, Mr. Arthur Beebe (BAFTA nominated Simon Callow) with the young men stripping naked and having a splash in the pond and running about, only to be caught by the passing ladies. Also starring BAFTA nominated Rosemary Leach as Mrs. Marian Honeychurch, Rupert Graves as Freddy Honeychurch, Patrick Godfrey as The Reverend Mr. Eager, Fabia Drake as Miss Catharine Alan, Joan Henley as Miss Teresa Alan, Maria Britneva as Mrs. Vyse, Amanda Walker as The Cockney Signora, Peter Cellier as Sir Harry Otway, and Mia Fothergill as Minnie Beebe. The all British cast all do rather well, Bonham Carter as the lovely lead, Day-Lewis as a mean and often arrogant fiancé to her, Sands as a likable other lover, and actors Smith, Dench, Elliott and my favourite Callow making a good impression too, it may not have been the easiest film to follow, but for great costumes, stars and location filming it is a charming period drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score for Richard Robbins, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

8,rmax304823,"""The Tempestuous Tulip.""",6,25 February 2010,"A tasteful film. Very tasteful. I knew it was going to be tasteful during the first scene. A soprano has just been singing a familiar aria. The setting is a pension in Florence. Two middle-class English women, Maggie Smith and the younger Helena Bonham Carter, find that the rooms they've booked don't have a view. Smith makes a considerable fuss. Two English gentlemen witness this confrontation, Denholm Elliott and his son, the handsome blond Julian Sands. Elliott interrupts the argument with his brusque working-class manner and offers the ladies his rooms, which do have a view. Huffily, slightly wary, Smith accepts after she thinks about the propriety of the act, but then makes Carter take the elder man's room because, after all, you never know what might happen if a young lady sleeps in the room a young man has just vacated.I was fully prepared to nod out, while everyone intuited everyone else on the screen. Not that I'm an anti-elitist. I'm a literature maven myself. I read James Joyce's poem, ""Trees,"" though I have to admit I've always thought ""A Room With a View"" was written by Virginia Woolfe. No matter.The whole affair is so subtle as it unfolds before us. Should Helena Bonham Carter marry the sere, stiff aesthete Daniel Day-Lewis (in a magnificent performance)? Or should she marry Julian Sands, the impulsive, dashing, reckless youth who wordlessly wraps her in his arms in the middle of a barley field and smothers her with a big wet kiss? She opts for the more dangerous mate, the one whose father has shouted, ""The answer to the everlasting WHY, WHY, WHY -- is YES!"" I worried for her, frankly. I was afraid her married life might turn out to be a little more -- experimental -- than she might have anticipated.Well, it's easy to make fun of these Edwardian finger exercises. The rules are so strict that Bonham is advised to avoid playing Beethoven on the piano because it might make her ""peevish."" Yet it's unfair to do so. However ridiculous the social guidelines seem to us, I can easily imagine our own looking equally ridiculous to those left alive a hundred years from now. Also, speaking as an anthropologist, a culture is a culture and we should always hesitate before making judgments about the customs of others, whether distant from us in space or time. There's a reason for everything, and certainly the stone-heavy repression we see here is reason enough for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" The problem, if there is one, lies not with the culture, with its hints and intrigues, but with the thoroughly serious treatment of it by E. M. Forster. Some critics see irony in it. I tend to see irony in Oscar Wilde.I don't know if Julian Sands is particularly handsome or not. He gives a smooth and easy performance as a free thinker. Daniel Day-Lewis has a more complex role in that he's faced with a challenge to his prissy self-esteem and is forced to deal with it. With his stiff bearing and precise demeanor, his thin mustache, his walking stick, and his pince nez, if he cocked his hat to the side a bit, he'd look like James Joyce, whose ""Ulysses"" was set in the same period. Helena Bonham Carter is innocent and virtuous, though her performance suggests a tiger lurking underneath all that froth and filigree. She's a little doll. She looks about five feet tall. Her features are pinched and beautiful. She has a large, pale forehead and tiny lips and her eyes project a keen intelligence.At any rate, I didn't nod out. Some of the characters and their names -- I just couldn't keep straight, but the story wandered around in an interesting way, like a tour of an exotic city. Nice views of the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge on which Dante fell in love with his lovely Beatrice -- from which I once saw a man with perfect poise urinating into the Arno below. A little more of that kind of irony might have pepped things up.",A Room with a View

10,blanche-2,Ah for the days of Merchant-Ivory,9,25 April 2007,"""A Room with a View"" is perhaps the jewel in the Merchant-Ivory crown, done in 1985, during their marvelous heyday. It was an era in film of lushly photographed dramas of another time and place, popular perhaps because many of us yearned for a simpler life and a return to some basic manners and standards. But these films also pointed up how much better women have it now, given the repressive ways women in earlier times were forced to live, and how often true love had to give way to convention.Beautifully orchestrated with Puccini operatic music from ""Gianni Schicchi"" and ""La Rondine,"" ""A Room with a View"" is a story set in Victorian times and concerns a young woman named Lucy, the petite Helena Bonham-Carter, who, while in Italy with her chaperone (Maggie Smith), meets George Emerson (Julian Sands). He falls madly in love with her, but unaccustomed to such boldness, she snubs him. Back home in England, she becomes betrothed to the tiresome, proper and erudite Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis). Then George appears on the scene again. The passion only evidenced in Lucy's piano playing begins to surface, and it frightens her.The story is told with both lightness and humor, and this intimate film is buoyed by wonderful acting. With her petite figure, magnificent head of hair, and a face full of expression, Bonham Carter is perfect as a confused and resentful young woman who doesn't know what's happening to her emotionally. Maggie Smith is brilliant as a troublesome chaperone who lives life by strict rules; Judi Dench is equally good as a novelist who lives in the exact opposite way. As George, Sands is a subtle yet ardent swain, and both Denholm Elliott as George's caring father and Simon Callow as the good reverend create marvelous, full characters. The chameleon, though, is Daniel Day-Lewis as Cecil, Lucy's skinny, snobbish fiancé. Each performance he gives is so drastically different from the one before - he is truly an amazing actor.The film is an allegory in its way for the passage from Victorian England to the Edwardian period, and it's clear that E.M. Forester had no use for the repressions of the day and celebrated a boldness of spirit. Both the repressed and the rebellious are perfectly represented in ""A Room with a View,"" a true Valentine to love.",A Room with a View

Then George (by chance) moves near her...and sparks start to fly.This is a costume drama and, like most of them, this is slow-moving and deliberately paced but I was never bored. The script is sharp, the movie looks beautiful and the cast is full of established English actors who know how to play their roles to the hilt. The only not so good acting was by Rupert Graves, Sands and Carter--but they were all very young when they did this so they were still learning. The only bad acting is by Daniel Day-Lewis. He plays his character so ridiculously obvious that he's just annoying. It's good that he has a small role. Also you probably think this is stuffy and dull...but there is a sequence when Graves, Sands and Simon Callow all go skinny-dipping! And yes--you see everything but it's all so innocent and fun that it's hard to be shocked. I saw it in a theatre and nobody was even remotely bothered.

If this review seems overly negative, it may be that I should not have watched this so soon after Emma. I do believe that I, by now, am all Britished out. At least for a little while. Don't get me wrong; I love the culture and the verbal comedy... but even I can get tired of it, especially with two films that are both jam-packed with pretentious types in such a short space of time. So anyway, this feels a lot like it was based on a play, though that doesn't particularly bring any negatives with it... by which I am referring to the numerous things that work in the theater that do not on screen. Thus, the acting is nice and subtle, and the performances are excellent. Everyone is well-cast. The dialog is well-written and impeccably delivered. Editing and cinematography are good. I wasn't terribly surprised by an awful lot of the plot, and this seemed to end *really* abruptly; I don't know, maybe it's just me, perhaps it's intentional.

It's like an adult version of a ""Mr. Rogers"" episode.This Merchant/Ivory production is typically polished and oh-so-tasteful, but like all of their movies it feels like the cinematic equivalent of one of those museum dioramas. It's not very lively, even if it is painstakingly accurate in its period detail.Maggie Smith and Denholm Elliott were awarded Oscar nominations, but the standout actors are Daniel Day-Lewis, playing a hopelessly uptight and ridiculous suitor, and Judi Dench, who plays an adventurous novelist who's far more exciting than any other character in the film.Grade: B+",A Room with a View
15,HotToastyRag,To each his own,3,24 February 2021,"It's very funny: no matter how much my brother and I put up a fight and tried to beg or bargain our way out of it, our parents forced us to watch A Room with a View over and over again. Thankfully, we were able to (mostly) remember when to cover our eyes. Anyone out there, when he says, ""Come, have a bathe,"" that's your cue to look away unless you want to look at way too much male nudity.The sweet, young Helena Bonham Carter stars as a young woman whose passions betray the constraints of her time period. Back in those days, it wasn't socially acceptable to kiss man before you were betrothed. Men walked on the inside of the sidewalk, to save a woman's dress in case a puddle splashed up from a carriage wheel. Tennis matches and piano concertos were approved forms of entertainment - not deep talks about philosophy and feelings. But what to do if you don't fit in? You could take a vacation to Florence with your old maid aunt as a chaperone, look at nude paintings and statues, and get kissed by a total stranger in a field of wild flowers.My brother never liked this movie because he believed Julian Sands had forced the kiss upon the innocent Helena (on whom he harbored a massive crush). I never liked it because I thought Helena needed to grow up. Couldn't she just suck it up and marry Daniel Day Lewis? Was it really all that important to talk about your feelings and smooch in the warm Italian sunshine?To each his own, and if you like romantic period pieces like The Age of Innocence, you'll probably love this one. At least you'll get to see Judi Dench and Maggie Smith looking young. Judi is like a Katharine Hepburn-esque feminist pioneer, and Denholm Elliott has some fun lines and smirks. Although why was Maggie Smith supposed to be so insufferable? I liked her character!Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

16,JamesHitchcock,Intellectual about Emotions,8,3 August 2017,"""A Room with a View"" was part of the great E. M. Forster cycle of the eighties and early nineties when, starting with David Lean's ""A Passage to India"" from 1984, five of his six novels were turned into films. Three of these- this one, ""Maurice"" and ""Howard's End""- were directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant. Some films bear little resemblance to the books on which they are ostensibly based, but Merchant and Ivory follow their literary source quite closely, even dividing the film into sections corresponding to Forster's chapters.The film is set in during the Edwardian period in England and Italy, although all the major characters are English. The plot can be summarised as ""two boys love one girl"". The girl is Lucy Honeychurch, daughter of a wealthy upper-middle class English family. The boys are her fiancé Cecil Vyse and George Emerson, a handsome young man whom she meets on holiday in Italy.Forster was touching on a theme with which he was to deal at greater length in his next novel, ""Howard's End"", a theme which was also a preoccupation of his German contemporary Thomas Mann, namely the contrast between the ""artistic"" and ""bourgeois"" attitudes to life. In ""Howard's End"" the two sides are represented by the cultured Schlegel family (with whom Forster's sympathies clearly lie) and the solidly Philistine Wilcoxes. Here, however, the emphasis is rather different. The artistic side is represented by Cecil, a supercilious cultural snob whom Forster may have been using to satirise the pretensions of the Aesthetic Movement. Although the bourgeois Honeychurches can also be snobbish, they are less pretentious, and Lucy herself, a gifted pianist with a passion for classical music, is far from uncultured. (The same cannot, however, be said for her mother Marion and her loud, brash brother Freddy).Another important theme is the way in which the values of the old century are giving way to those of the new. The old Victorian era is associated with adherence to social convention and emotional repression, the new Edwardian one with a more free-spirited and emotionally liberated attitude. This distinction is not, however, necessarily the same as the difference between old and young. There are free-thinking, unconstrained older people, such as George's eccentric father, and more emotionally reticent younger ones, such as Lucy who finds it difficult to give free expression to her feelings, at least in words. (She has no problem in expressing them through her music).The two performances I liked least came from Denholm Elliott and Julian Sands as the two Emersons, father and son. I know that Elliott tried hard to make old Mr Emerson lovably unconventional, but I was left with the impression that he would have been unbearably irritating in real life. Sands came across as pleasant but a bit too bland for the hero of a romantic drama. I certainly could have done without that scene in which George, Freddy and the local vicar all splash about naked in a pool, a heavy-handed way of emphasising the young men's boisterousness and free spirits.On the positive side, I liked Helena Bonham-Carter as Lucy, Maggie Smith as Marion's uptight cousin Charlotte who acts as Lucy's companion and chaperone in Italy, and Daniel Day-Lewis as Cecil. Bonham-Carter was at the start of her acting career, but she gave great promise for the future. (She was to become something of a specialist in period dramas and appeared in two more Forster adaptations, ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"" and ""Howard's End""). On the surface, Cecil seems to be a one-dimensional character, a caricature of the self-satisfied and opinionated culture-vulture, but Day-Lewis is able to suggest that this surface may be a mere façade. Cecil's aestheticism may be just another form of emotional repression. He has no problem with expressing his views on art or literature, but expressing his deeper feelings is another matter. When Lucy breaks off her engagement to him on the grounds that he has no deeper feelings, at least for people as opposed to objects, I felt she may have been doing him an injustice.As one might expect from Merchant/Ivory, the film is visually beautiful and makes good use of its location settings, whether in Florence or in the Kent countryside. (Lucy's home village, Summer Street, is supposedly in Surrey but these scenes were actually shot in Chiddingstone, Kent). It also makes good use of music, especially Puccini's aria ""O My Beloved Father"" (perhaps less over-familiar in the mid-eighties than it is today) which sounds wonderfully appropriate to the Italian settings, even if it was not written until a decade after Forster's novel.One criticism I have heard of the film is that ""nothing happens"". Although it is certainly true that there is little in the way of physical action, and fewer dramatic developments than in, say, ""A Passage to India"" or ""Howard's End"", this is not a criticism I accept. On an emotional level there is actually a lot going on. As roger Ebert pointed out, ""It is an intellectual film, but intellectual about emotions: It encourages us to think about how we feel, instead of simply acting on our feelings"". This sort of emotional intelligence is not always easy to convey in the cinema- it is probably easier to do it via the written word- but I think that Merchant and Ivory succeed in doing it here. 8/10 A goof. There is a curious inconsistency about the pronunciation of Cecil's name. Most of the characters pronounce it as ""Sissil"", but George insists on ""Sessil"", even though he knows Cecil personally. Also, ""Powell"" (the name of one of the servants) is pronounced by some characters to rhyme with ""Cole"" and by others to rhyme with ""Cowell"".",A Room with a View
17,lasttimeisaw,"a nonpareil British drama-comedy, souped up by scrumptious trimmings aplenty",9,25 March 2018,"A revisit of this resplendent Merchant-Ivroy-Jhabvala costume porn, A ROOM WITH A VIEW, has wondrously retained its entrancing lusciousness in the wake of the impeccable restoration. Spending a belle-époque vacation in Florence, young English lady Lucy Honeychurch (Bonham Carter), hailed from an upper-middle class upbringing, is chaperoned by her elder cousin Charlotte Barlett (Smith), meets a sundry of compatriots in their pensione, among which, Mr. Emerson (Elliott) and his son George (Sands), express their willingness to exchange their rooms with the ladies' upon Charlotte's grievance that their rooms don't have a view. A gesture with benevolence is met with Charlotte's utter dismay, who is ingrained in her straitlaced head space and constantly clashes with Lucy's more open-minded temperament falling in with the story's turn-of-the-century ethos. The pair's Florentine sojourn is topped off by an impulsive kiss from George with Lucy in its receiving end during a rural sally, what would have happened next (nudge nudge wink wink) is successfully pre-empted by Charlotte's intervention, and the scandal is sworn of secrecy by both Lucy and Charlotte, but little do we know, one of them cannot keep that promise and the other would be fallen under the magic spell, of such a banal but passionate kiss. The next chapter spirits Lucy away to her home turf, where she consents to the engagement with a pedantic gentleman Cecil Vyse (Day-Lewis), but due to a quirk of fate (or rather, its author E.M. Forster's novelistic licence), George and his father materialize themselves as the new tenants of a cottage in the same village, their settlement wrong-foots a seemingly contented Lucy, and ripples of that previous impulse (accentuated by George's constant presence) actuates Lucy to rethink her nuptial decision and for the first time, acknowledges to her true feelings which will find her the fulfillment that breaches the entrenched class barrier. Consequentially, A ROOM WITH A VIEW is blessed with a cracking dramatis personae, Maggie Smith, in her another terrific Oscar-nomimated showcase that significantly solidifies her priggish spinster screen persona of her later career, self-consciously warbling her way through her passive-aggressive stock-in-trade, but when subjected to the pitfall of becoming a laughingstock, she will plough on with a tenacious obliviousness that remarkably intimates how hard for a woman of her bearings to survive (apparently) unscathed under such a snooty milieu.BAFTA favorite Denholm Elliott bags his once-in-a-lifetime Oscar nomination as the solicitous, agreeable Mr. Emerson, but by my lights, the champ among supporting actors (against a fierce competition from Elliott, Simon Callow's exceedingly personable and responsive Reverend Mr. Beebe, the mascot of the film, and Julian Sands' flash-in-the-pan raffish brio), is none other than Mr. Day-Lewis, stylishly out of step with the repugnant stereotype of a high-brow, conservative scion, even he is not cut out for Lucy, one certainly feels sorry for him when he accepts his defeat in a gentlemanly manner, which effectively salvages the supposedly most antipathetic character in the story and purveys Cecil a dignified, yet rather touching sheen that is not present in the book. While Maggie Smith is unequivocally the cherrypick among the film's petticoat players, one would be too remiss to not mention Judi Dench's novelist Eleanor Lavish, who shares most of her scenes with Smith (for stanned fans, it marks a monumental moment!), taking in her stride spirited convos that triumph the Bechdel test (but not above tittle-tattling), also Rosemary Leach has a good run as Lucy's patrician, nonplussed mother, but it is quite a slight that a 18-year-old Helena Bonham Carter is left without much fanfare in her stunning film debut, who stoutly holds her own against any member of these more experienced thespians, only if her final liberation doesn't lead to a faintly saccharine revisit of Florence with her beau, but a new perspective on her own life and role in a larger context, as an independent woman who doesn't suppress her feelings and thoughts, perceives the world with an upgraded awareness, that would be a more perspicacious ending for today's viewers. In the event, A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a nonpareil British drama-comedy, souped up by scrumptious trimmings aplenty (cinematography, costume, music, production design and a collective fusillade of hallmark elocution), where Victorian formality fighting a losing battle with Edwardian enlightenment, and the Merchant-Ivroy-Jhabvala trinity's best work!",A Room with a View
18,ElMaruecan82,All the ways lead to Rome ... but Florence leads to all the ways ...,9,31 July 2013,"The remarkable thing about the Merchant-Ivory productions (in fact a solid triumvirate if we count the writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala) is that they're generally less about plots than characters, and so real they never seem to act according to a specific screenplay, but are rather conditioned by the two main forces of the story: space and time.Indeed, over the course of time, relationships are done and undone and the coldest heart can melt like Anthony Hopkins in ""The Remains of the Day"". ""Howard's End"" was much about an estate, symbolizing the rural roots of British aristocracy, before it surrendered to business-driven modernism. Generally set at crucial periods of British history, the Merchant-Ivory productions are about people who are the products of their age while a new one is coming, and they generally use their houses as a symbolic stronghold to resist the ineluctable changes.And ""A Room with a View"", adapted from E.M Forster's novel of the same name, is the metaphor of the very point the story makes. Even the smallest room can open onto a large town, the sky, the infinite, like so many paths one can take from life, if he or she dares to get rid of the weight of past and conventions. A room can be made of beds and austere furniture to welcome a young woman from a British hamlet, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bohnam Carter) and her restraining chaperon Charlotte (Maggie Smith), but it can offer a panoramic view of one of the most romantic towns in the world: Florence.And the first pages of this cinematic book open in Florence, in a small pension, where a group of vacationers meet. Miss Charlotte complains about the missing view in the room, to which, invited during the following dinner, a free-spirited man, Mr. Emerson (Delnhom Elliott) proposes to switch their rooms. Emerson came with his son, and both belong to another class, high enough to afford a voyage to Italy, but whose philosophical views suggest that they embraced the turn-of-century, contrarily to the Victorian Charlotte, who refused the proposal, shocked by Emerson's lack of tact, while his reaction proves that he meant no disrespect. She eventually accepts, convinced by other guests of the pension, Reverend Beebe (Simon Callow) and the old Allan sisters.This benign episode foreshadows the coming conflicts between the old and new order in England circa 1910, to which space and time provide crucial elements. The film is set during the Edwardian period; a sort of in-between decade where British people could nonchalantly enjoy the achievements of the more prestigious Victorian era, like a historical calm before the storm of the Great War. And being a film of dazzling imagery, the sight of these British vacationers enjoying a picnic in a Tuscan setting, savoring tea and bathing under a sepia summer sun, and a cool summer breeze, is an eloquent illustration of the quiet optimism that prevailed during that period.And this bourgeois idleness, combined with a natural setting, creates the perfect cocktail for a passionate romance, leading to the inevitable moment when the mysterious George Emerson, played by the handsome Julian Sands, gives a passionate kiss to an unchaperoned Lucy. She didn't see it coming, nor did she expect the kiss' everlasting effect, awakening the most passionate impulses. The kiss sweeps off all the conventions, the good manners that condemned Lucy to a life of rigidity, giving all its meaning to the setting in Florence, the most defining town of the Renaissance. Literally, George's kiss is Lucy's renaissance.But this is only the first act and back home; the kiss is already history after Charlotte's intervention. And when during the next scene, we meet Cecil Vyse, Daniel Day-Lewis as Lucy's future husband, a living caricature of snobbish prig with his oiled hair, rigid stature and annoying noise clip, we're puzzled but not surprised. The film doesn't embarrass itself with explanations and trusts us enough to connect the events together. So, regarding the mysterious choice of Cecyl as a husband, I guess, we should get back to the 'room with a view' metaphor.Indeed, with George, Lucy had 'a room with a view', with Cecyl, she would have thousands of rooms with no view at all. Breaking his eternally taciturn facade, George is given one opportunity to have a heart-talk with Lucy; he tells her that her marriage with Cecyl would turn her into an ornament, for the man would never be able to value her, or any woman for that matter. This is one of the outbursts of passion the film serves at the right moment to remind us that there is still a story after all, and a question: to which direction will Lucy's heart lean? And it's not just a choice between two men, but two orders, two states of mind, two kissing ways.Roger Ebert, in one of his most enthusiastic reviews, insisted on the conflict between heart and mind, passion and intellect. I wish he had a few words about space and time as either the restraining or catalyzing elements in our lives. It's restraining when you have characters with the privilege to enjoy some escapism in a beautiful Italian landscape, but are still tied to Victorian good manners, or catalyzing, when three men, including a priest, play like children in a lake, all naked. The swimming sequence is exhilarating, and the massive male nudity never bothers, a credit to the directing and the cast's performances.Of course, as enchanting as it is, ""A Room with a View"" is less politically oriented than other Ivory-Merchant productions while there was more to say about socialism, feminism, weight of traditions, bourgeois insouciance, but the specific pretension of ""A Room with a View"" was to depict another slice of British life, from which two hearts would converge in a small point of the world, a room with a view  on the infinite, on the future, on love.",A Room with a View
19,inkblot11,"This view is most lovely, with no room for improvement whatsoever",10,30 October 2008,"Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) is on a trip to Florence with her aunt Charlotte (Maggie Smith). Upon arrival at their inn, the two women discover that their rooms have no view of the town but face the wall of another building. That night at the inn's dining table, Charlotte complains loudly about their rooms, the food, and just about everything else. Seated at their table are a father, Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliot) and his attractive son, George (Julian Sands). Out of the blue, the two men offer to exchange rooms with the ladies, noting that they do not care whether they have views or not. Charlotte is aghast, for they certainly can't accept such a proposal, especially from working class Englishmen. But, the change is made, for Mr. Emerson insists. Later, on a journey to the Italian countryside, George gets Lucy in a passionate kissing fest and the beautiful young lady's world is turned upside-down, for she is engaged to a Brit back home. Telling George never to approach her again, Lucy and Charlotte return to Britain. Once re-connected to her fiancé, Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis), Lucy begins planning her wedding. But, horrors! Totally by happenstance alone, Mr. Emerson and George become the town's newest tenants and run smack into Lucy and company again. And again. Can Lucy resist George's charms if she is tested once more? This is a most lovely film, guaranteed to be a huge hit with any viewer who chooses it. First, the cast is sensational. Bonham Carter is enchanting as the well-brought up but impulsive Lucy while Smith is a stitch as the bumbling aunt and chaperone. Elliot is his usual wonderful self, Sands is mesmerizing while Simon Callow, Rosemary Leach, Rupert Graves, Fabia Drake and the rest are very fine indeed. As for Day-Lewis, he is stupendous as the snooty, prissy aristocrat who looks nothing like the handsome star of the Last of the Mohicans, among other major films. Second, the scenery is ""out of this world"" as both the Italian and English settings are overwhelmingly beautiful, and the costumes are equally breathtaking. Finally, the script and the direction are flawless, making the E.M. Forster novel come to life to beat the band. In short, don't put off a view of this ""View""! Cloud nine or higher is the only possible feeling after watching this bonafide treasure of a film.",A Room with a View

Acting was superb by all involved, especially by Daniel Day-Lewis who stole every scene as Cecil - amazing performance, if a bit theatrical, but this is Daniel Day-Lewis we are talking about.

Also visible in this confection are Simon Callow (as a gloriously camp vicar), Rupert Graves (as Lucy's sweet younger brother Freddie), Julian Sands (as Lucy's love interest, but rather a cardboard confection), Maggie Smith (Lucy's flaky chaperone), and Denholm Elliott as a fellow tourist.Taken from the Forster novel, it works as a snapshot of upper middle-class life and travel, and  sits against the best of the Merchant-Ivory catalogue (Maurice, Howard's End, Jane Austen in Manhattan, The Remains of the Day), remaining as one of their more realised achievements.",A Room with a View

The cinematography and costumes are outstanding, beautifully evoking the genteel side of Edwardian England and iconic Tuscan city on the Arno when there was only a smattering of tourists. There's not much to the story (the novel is considered one of E.M. Forster's lesser works) but the outstanding cast makes the most of what they are given.

The film is both polite and mocking, with the sometimes tongue-in-cheek attitude reinforced by several coy title cards salted throughout the story, marking changes of scene and so forth.

26,adamjohns-42575,Beautiful views.,2,18 March 2021,"Having already read and watched Forster's Howard's End, I'm not sure why I expected this one to be any different. It is slightly better in that the story seems less convoluted, although I'm sure that there's a secret love triangle going on between Freddie, Mr Beebe and George, a square if you include Honeychurch and a pentagon if you throw Cecil in to the mix too. Perhaps that was clearer in the book and edited out for the film version. I will never know the difference, because I have not one intention of reading the book at all.It's a simple enough story, as stated above, but I don't really see how anyone can fall in love based on the circumstances presented in this film. What did they find interesting about each other? It really isn't very clear. Not to mention the fact that Julian Sands is an absolutely terrible actor in this film, unless he was supposed to be, ya know, a bit special? Daniel Day's, Cecil had moments of brilliance and moments of eek as well. Not the most consistently acted role.
Helena, although not my favourite at all, does a very good job as do the Dame's Maggie and Judi, who you just can't beat and Denholm is just charming.I do think that Forster's work translate better to film, where you can see more easily what he was trying to say, but that is purely based on my reading of Howard's End.
His depiction of the world is a very fancy and posh one that doesn't really suit my tastes or my likes. Don't get me wrong, I love a smart dinner party, Etc, but this is all very exaggerated propriety and ladies being chaperoned. All too daft an attitude as far as I am concerned.There is a bathing scene in the middle, which, while enjoyable to a degree for a perve like me, is just very odd and perhaps more for the benefit of those filming rather than the viewer. It is perhaps my reason for thinking that Mr Beebe, George and Freddie might like to get intimate with each other.Generally, as films go, it's made well, with the exception of the sound. Occasionally it seemed like some of the voices had been recorded again and added in post production, especially for Cecil and George. It's a bit off putting.I didn't feel the need to turn it off, which is a good sign for a film, but at least now I can say that I've seen it and I can stick to things that I already know that I enjoy instead.",A Room with a View

I really like how the movie goes through all of its predictability by presenting the conflicts in a very much mild way and inserting some humor into the mix. Furthermore the movie made the humor as though they weren't intended to be humorous, not right after it comes into the picture. Another thing about the movie is that I realized that I watched Helena Bonham-Carter movies just on her older days, and she is very pretty. Well now I know that she's even prettier in her younger days. The acting overall in the movie is adequately nice. Helena Bonham-Carter's performance sure isn't her best here but she sure can act. Daniel Day Lewis really delved into his character and can really make the audience feel irritated to him. Maggie Smith had really depicted her character well enough and can make audience feel sorry for her.

Before taping this movie I only new the title, the station on which it was to be seen and the hour when it was playing. Believing that this would be a Hitchkock-like movie (in my opinion this could be a typical Hitchkock title), I had high expectations about it. Big was my surprise when I actually saw it. I'm not saying that I didn't like it, it just was everything but the thriller that I expected to see.This movie tells the story of Lucy Honeychurch, a young Englishwoman, who, in the early 1900's, makes her first visit to Florence in Italy with her chaperon Charlotte Bartlett. Despite the fact that they hoped to have a marvelous view on the city, they are laid to sleep in rooms without a view. But fellow guests Mr Emerson and his quiet, yet eccentric son George are willing to switch rooms with the ladies. But the switching of rooms has a larger effect than could be foreseen. Once returned to England, Lucy is supposed to marry her fiancé Cecil, but she started to be more and more attracted to George and thinks about canceling her marriage plans with Cecil.If there is one group of people that shouldn't miss this movie than it must be the fans of the Jane Austen novels.

Victorian England is a popular source of imagination and many people love the movies based on these stories. Personally I'm not really a fan of this kind of movies, but I have to admit that this movie is good. It will never be my favorite because I'm not too keen on this kind of costume drama's, but the terrific setting (I'm a great admirer of Italy in general and Florence in particular), the nice acting and the interesting story made me forget about that for once. All in all this is a nice movie that has a lot of good things to offer for all viewers, even for those who aren't fans of the genre.

31,dfle3,"A charming, amusing love story of perfect matches and mismatches",10,3 July 2008,"Based on a novel by English author E.M.Forster, ""A room with a view"" is a perfectly cast story of a young woman's first love. The first bit of great casting is Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy Honeychurch, a young woman being chaperoned in Italy by her cousin Charlotte Bartlett, played by Maggie Smith. That is really bizarre, as Bartlett seems around 3 to 4 times older than Lucy! In the commentary of the DVD, it's mentioned that Helena is 19 years old, which is presumably a similar age to the heroine of this tale, Lucy Honeychurch. Nowadays Bonham Carter is best known for playing decomposing corpses or such like. In this movie you see her at her youthful best. This must have been one of her first roles, you'd think.This is very much a costume comedy/drama-think men and women in fancy costumes and horse drawn carriages and sweeping country estates...sort of Jane Austen territory.Lucy's first encounter with a man interested in her is with George Emerson in Italy, played by Julian Sands. He is sort of a primal but dorky man who is as honest as the day is long...a force of nature. There are complications later on when Lucy becomes involved with Cecil Vyse, played by Daniel Day-Lewis. According to the DVD commentary, this is Hyphenated-Name's second feature. D.D-L is squirmingly marvelous as the awful, idle-rich (or would be rich?) snob Vyse. He's a pure caricature of the upper class English twit. It's great to watch!Maggie Smith does a great job as the unbelievably annoying chaperon to Lucy-she seems to have a stick up her kazoo! This movie is the debut of the lively and attractive Rupert Graves who plays Lucy's brother, Fred. Simon Callow is also well cast as The Reverend Mr.Arthur Beebe.Just a note-this movie does contain one scene of naked men, but it is not a sexual scene-it's a bit of a hoot, really-so bare that in mind if you are thinking of allowing young children to watch it-they'd probably laugh at the scene, appropriately. Actually, I've just remembered-there is one scene of glimpsed violence and the resultant blood. It's just one scene though, and not that graphic.I love HBC here-I want to pledge my troth to her..whatever that means! Her facial expressions work a treat, and even when she gets them wrong, it's fine, as she is playing a girl, really and hence its somewhat apt (contrast that with Brad Pitt's encounter with Hector's father in ""Troy"" as Achilles, where there is no good reason he shouldn't have reshot that awful facial expression of his).One scene where HBC does get it wrong is in a scene with George's father near end of the movie, at his house when he is getting ready to vacate it. But she does make up for it in a marvellous scene where she is playing the piano and Beebe is with her. Her facial expression is terrific during one moment with him.Really, this is a great movie for the performances and characterisations. HBC is captivating as an emerging young woman whose youth excuses her foibles.",A Room with a View

33,roghache,"Disappointing view, Victorian repression yet again",6,7 April 2006,"I admittedly did not read E.M. Forster's novel and haven't seen this movie for quite some years, but was extremely disappointed with it at the time, having had great expectations.The story revolves around a young English girl, Lucy Honeychurch, who has traveled to Florence with her strict cousin & prim spinster chaperon, Charlotte Bartlett. While in Florence, their hotel room lacks the desired scenic view, so fellow English tourists, Mr. Emmerson and his son George, offer to exchange rooms with them. Lucy and the liberal George begin a romantic attraction, much to the displeasure of cousin Charlotte, as Lucy already has a more suitable & aristocratic (though insufferably snobbish) fiancé, Cecil, back in England. After returning home, Lucy is torn between her socially expected marriage to Cecil and her desire for George.Helena Bonham Carter is competent in the role of the genteel Lucy, though I personally failed to become that engaged in her predictable romantic tale and in fact found her rather annoying. Maggie Smith is of course wonderful as her thwarting chaperon, 'poor Charlotte', who alas, is invariably mocked and labeled as uptight. The film indeed features impressive period costumes, wonderful cinematography (including magnificent Florentine vistas), and beautiful musical scoring (Puccini operas & Beethoven piano sonatas). However, there is some lazy writing here. Bit of a coincidence, isn't it? that the young English tourist, George, whom Lucy meets at her hotel in Florence just happens to become her new neighbour back home in England. All very convenient.Also, this is yet another variation on the theme of Victorian sexual repression, not exactly a novel concept. In Forster's 1984 A Passage to India, the repression theme again manifests itself in the personage of Adela Quested, but I greatly preferred that particular tale with its conflict between the Raj and native Indians. I absolutely adore Jane Austen's novels and their modern cinematic versions, but, frankly, this particular costume drama is no Jane Austen. One reviewer commented that anyone complaining about this movie 'has issues'. Funny, Austen's stories continue to remain popular two centuries or so after her death, without including any nude bathing scenes or whatever. Call me repressed, but I'm with Cecil and wouldn't be particularly comfortable myself stumbling upon a group of bathers skinny dipping. I wouldn't swoon, but neither would I go out of my way to lallygag about. I have no objections to nude bathing, but neither am I of the opinion that those who choose to do so necessarily represent a more enlightened form of humanity than those who do not. Pity, but I guess the point being made here is that modesty is an undesirable quality and is synonymous with being 'uptight'. Of course that's the modern philosophy, but I beg to differ. As for the vicar bathing nude, just the usual modern cinematic attempt to mock or denigrate the clergy.Why couldn't the more traditional Cecil (with his sensitivities about modesty issues) have been made the nice guy rather than a boorish snob, and the sexually liberal George have had a nasty streak? I guess conservative (repressed? uptight?) equals snob and liberal equals loving & caring. This tale is just so predictable, I don't understand why people sing its praises so highly, other than for its obviously impressive cinematography, music, and costuming.Yes, a depiction of period styles & manners, but the focus on personal passions versus social expectations is not a very original idea. I fully expected to love this picture, but simply found it had both an unoriginal romantic conflict and a very predictable ending. My stars are for the views of Florentine art & architecture, the Beethoven sonatas, and yes, perhaps even that beautifully photographed, romantic kiss in the field of flowers...but not for the generally hackneyed theme or the stereotypical characters.",A Room with a View
34,dr_clarke_2,Flawlessly made and utterly delightful,10,31 May 2021,"A Room with a View is Merchant-Ivory's celebrated 1985 adaptation of E. M. Forster's classic novel of the same name. Costume dramas based on works of literature are ten-a-penny in British cinema, but A Room with a View stands out amongst them, partly because of the careful adaptation of the source material, partly because of the acting, and partly because of James Ivory's characteristically thoughtful direction.Forster's novel is both a romance and a critique of society at the time, both traits common to most of his novels. Unlike, for example, A Passage to India, it is largely gentle (the stabbing of an unnamed Italian man aside), with a plot that focuses entirely on the love affair between the two main protagonists and with a happy ending for pretty much everyone; even Lucy Honeychurch's spurned fiancé Cecil grudgingly accepts that she has correctly analysed his faults when she breaks off their engagement. Forster's criticism of the conventions and constrictions of polite society are equally gentle: no biting satire this, but rather a quiet and humours exploration of the etiquette that prevents people from openly saying how they feel.The story sees the aforementioned Lucy on holiday in Florence with her mother's friend Charlotte Bartlett; she meets a young man named George Emerson when George's father overhears Lucy and Charlotte bemoaning their lack of a room with a view and offering - in a rather eccentric fashion - to swap. Love soon starts to blossom between Lucy and George but is quickly aborted when she returns to England and becomes engaged to Cecil, until fate conspires to bring them into each other's orbit once again. Regular Merchant-Ivory collaborator Ruth Prawer Jhabvala wrote the screenplay, which won her an Oscar; she does a fine job of adapting Forster's prose and also retains his wry sense of humour. There are explorations of class, with Cecil claiming that there should be no class divides and decrying snobbery, despite the fact that he is, himself, a snob. The naked bathing scene is hilarious, especially when the three men are disturbed by Lucy's party and the Reverend Mr. Beebe tries unsuccessfully to sneak surreptitiously away with his modesty intact.Forster's excellent characterisation carries through and is realised by a superb cast of seasoned British thespians that includes Maggie Smith as Charlotte Bartlett, Denholm Elliot as Mr Emerson, Daniel Day-Lewis as Cecil Vyse, and Judi Dench as Eleanor Lavish. Simon Callow plays the Reverend Mr Beebe, whilst a young Rupert Graves appears as Freddy Honeychurch. Day-Lewis is unrecognisable, although Denholm Elliot almost steals the show as the wonderfully irascible Mr Emerson. Helena Bonham-Carter and Julian Sands are cast in the lead roles of Lucy and George and both give captivating performances.Above all however, A Room with a View is a visually beautiful film. James Ivory's mise-en-scéne is as meticulous as it is always is and the location filming in Florence, London and Kent looks gorgeous. Tony Pierce-Roberts provides the cinematography, which helps to make Florence in particular as a much a character as any of the people in the film; the scene in which Lucy witnesses a young man being stabbed, before she faints, is magnificently shot, the close-up of the young man's face as blood flows from his mouth strangely beautifully and horrible at the same time. In a touch that reflects the structure of the novel, Ivory occasionally uses on screen titles to divide the film up into thematic chapters. The soundtrack by Richard Robbins with a little help from Puccini sung by Kiri Te Kanawa completes the picture. Merchant-Ivory made many stunning pictures, some of them arguably weightier or more important than A Room with a View; the fact that it remains so highly regarded amongst the rest of work is perhaps due to the fact that it is flawlessly made and utterly delightful.",A Room with a View
35,karlericsson,"Cecil, the true hero",7,17 March 2008,"23 years later, this film makes a different impression from when I saw it first. The truest character and the only loving one is Cecil - not the other hoodlums. Rocco Siffredi look-alike Julian Sands is full of lust, that is clear, but love? Hardly. True too, is the older Emerson and he, his only fought being his blindness to his son's self-love, is the central character of the film, for sure - besides Cecil. Poor Cecil - nobody understands him and he cannot express himself more without giving it all away - of course, I'm talking about the true Cecil now, the Cecil that the author of this book misinterpreted but not enough for him (Cecil) becoming totally invisible. Too good for this world - that is Cecil. I kid you not!!!",A Room with a View
36,badajoz-1,Dull and wooden,4,5 May 2009,"So another Merchant-Ivory, and another UK period drama, so what?! It passes the time nicely enough but there is little here to stir anything. Good performances from some excellent actors/actresses notwithstanding, the plot is pretty poor, and the characters of the leading protagonists - eg Bonham Carter and Sands - do not make us really believe in this piece. There are some interesting background moments about the period - Rosemary Williams dressing to be fully buttoned up as women of the period did, and the nude bathing (far too long) indicating the famous poem about the opening of the First World War - 'Swimmers into cleanness leaping'- and the fate that lay in wait for a generation of young Edwardian men. But not enough. Insular British snobbery goes down well in the US I suppose, but pretty pictures and langourous hot summers do not make films interesting of themselves.",A Room with a View

There in a pension they encounter Mr Emerson and his son George. Mr. Emerson trades rooms with the women so that they might have rooms with views.George falls in love with Lucy and steals a kiss from her. Her chaperon sees this happen and returns Lucy at once to England. By chance Mr. Emerson and George rent a cottage near the Honeychurch's house... by this time Lucy is engaged to someone else. However true love wins out.I didn't care for the women's lib part of it (also the exaggerated era prudishness is cartoonish)....Lucy has spunk and George is the perfect milquetoast husband....""I want a wife who speaks her mind thinks on her own blah blah blah...."" This turns it into a typical modern PC chick flick....no wonder it was popular. That was the ""plot"" and raison d'etre of the film other reviewers are looking for.I did like the beautiful scenery and wonderfully recreated world of the Edwardian era.

38,ArmandoManuelPereira,An Enjoyable Romance With A Warm Performance by Bonham-Carter,7,12 July 2020,"At first I was tempted to think that the film was slow and pointless. Eventually though I found it enjoyablly romantic. Basically its the story of a young woman caught between the attentions of two men. One uninhibited, the other a snob. Before she can choose between them though, she will need to learn to embrace her true feelings. I wish to say one thing more concerning Daniel Day-Lewis. I'm aware that he is generally considered one of the great actors of our time, and I agree that he is interesting to watch. The issue for me is that his performances often feel overly studied. Including the one in this movie. Bonham-Carter on the other hand appears natural and warm. Just my opinion.",A Room with a View
39,thinbeach,I'd visit again,7,30 August 2018,"When pitched as romance fate is a charm, and such is the theme of Room With a View. A coincidence that Lucy's brief lover in Florence should become her neighbour in England, shortly after the announcement of her wedding to another? Nay, fate! This outlook conveniently neglects the many poor souls in the world that never get their second chances, their happily-ever-afters, but when a story is presented as beautifully as this, its easy to understand the appeal. Set mostly in wealthy estates of the Edwardian era, every centimetre of this film screams beauty, the elegant costumes and manicured gardens like an old master painting come to life, soundtracked with classical music. Whimsical travels, leisurely tennis, piano sittings, woodland walks, leather bound books, mahogany furniture, the list goes on, few films make me wish to get lost in their world such as this one.On the other hand, the opening sequences in Florence don't have half the sway of the rest in England, by which point some may have already nodded off. The romance here is only communicated effectively in cinematography, not character, as there is no chemistry between Lucy and George until their spontaneous kiss. The mannered conversations make some moments hard to relate, and the performances are a mixed bag, but ever so steadily true passions under the surface are revealed, as Lucy chases the ecstasy of desire, over the sensibility of position.",A Room with a View
40,AZINDN,Edwardian Eyeful,10,16 February 2012,"I will gush over this film because it is worthy of praise and a standing ovation. A Room With A View is likely one of the most perfect films to grace screens in decades. The E.M. Forrester story produced and directed by the team of Ivory and Merchant brings the tale of Miss Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) to life in perfect Edwardian splendor. Wonderful locations of the Florence cathedral, Palazzo Vecchio, sculpture by Donatello, and an assortment of rolling landscapes are stunning visual fodder for this comic tale of Apolonian vs. Dionesian parlor manners. Exquisite young Bonham-Carter's casting as the virginal heiress is thwarted by her traveling companion, the venerable Dame Maggie Smith as her meddling biddy chaperon, Aunt Charlotte, with Dame Judy Dench as a proto-Jackie Collins author, Elenore Lavish, Daniel Day-Lewis as the prissy snobbish Cecil Vyse, and, a gorgeous, naked Julian Sands as socialist George Emerson comprises a most outstanding casting achievement. The excellent soundtrack offering of Dame Kiri Te Kaniwa's rendition of ""O Mio Caro"" takes your breath away as are the bits of wonderful piano solos that Lucy produces throughout the film. The cinematography is most wonderful with scenic panoramas of the far off Florence or Lucy sauntering through a field of poppies and wildflowers to receive the kiss to curl your toes from George Emerson, well, can romantic love get any better? This video is required for collectors of films of Julian Sands and Daniel Day-Lewis, however, its real value is as one of the finest of the Merchant Ivory magic touch in film making.",A Room with a View
41,thomvic,A room with a view.....but I couldn't see much else,6,25 May 2011,"I suspected this movie was going to be a great drama with a good love story from what I read on the back of the DVD.Hmmmm well not really. For one thing, Helena Bonham Carter's character wasn't very sympathetic and it felt more like she was complaining or making snard remarks at everyone half the time. The whole Florence scenes felt more like they were trying to praise Italy for being a romantic place rather than giving it a real backing as a place of memory for Lucy Honeychurch and George. They had one fling when it could have happened anywhere.What's more, this feels like it could have done better in the theatre as a play and I'm not sure if there ever was one. This is definitely more dialogue driven than plot driven. Charlotte's character (Maggie Smith) feels more like Lucy's actual mother than her cousin and sometimes I had to remind myself she was her cousin than her mother.Performances were pretty good though I thought the characters weren't particularly interesting and also because the plot went at too quick of a pace to really make you absorb the emotions of the characters. Yes I know it is also meant to be a comedy as well but I didn't really find anything really funny. Though Daniel Day Lewis as Cecil was played to perfection and made for a very dorky character.Don't have too much expectations with this. It is fun and silly but in the end more of a play that doesn't really make you remember much.",A Room with a View
42,marissas75,Vivid comedy of manners,9,2 June 2007,"""A Room with a View"" is one of the best-known Merchant-Ivory films, the one that made their reputation for tastefully adapting Edwardian novels. Working from E. M. Forster's charming story, Merchant and Ivory add gorgeous Tuscan cinematography, lush opera music, and a cast of talented British actors. Even a skinny-dipping scene is done with enough class that the movie got away with a PG rating (though that probably wouldn't happen nowadays!). In short, Merchant-Ivory makes it look easyand this ease has led to charges of their films being dull and middlebrow, as well as to many imitators.But this stereotype of ""a Merchant-Ivory film"" fails to mention just how vivid and hilarious ""A Room with a View"" actually is. With scene-stealing actors like Maggie Smith as a prim, passive-aggressive chaperone and Daniel Day-Lewis as a self-centered young man whose every gesture tells of his fastidious rigidity, a rich vein of humor runs through the film. The movie also delights in putting its heroine Lucy (a baby-faced Helena Bonham Carter) in situations that prove awkward, funny, and ultimately invigorating for a well-bred young lady of 1905. Lucy finds herself in a love triangle, with society telling her to choose Cecil (Day- Lewis) but a deeper force pulling her toward the unconventional, moody George Emerson (Julian Sands).A comedy of manners, ""A Room with a View"" is sometimes guilty of seeing its characters as types, rather than people. Even Lucy is not much more than ""the young girl transfigured by Italy"" that Miss Lavish (Judi Dench), a writer of cheap novels, labels her as. Still, it's easy to get caught up in the romance of this delightful movie. After seeing it, you'll want to go out and defend Truth and Love from all those who would deny them. Or at least to start saving up for a trip to Italy.",A Room with a View
43,ihrtfilms,It doesn't get much more British than this.,8,1 December 2010,"Goodness, they don't make them like this anymore, which as Maggie Smith's Charlotte would say, is very vexing indeed. This is one of those classic British period dramas that not only is one of the best, but one that has stood the test of time.With a superb recreation of the era and great use of both the magic of Florence and the beauty of the English countryside, visually the film is a treat. With it's story of missed and wrong opportunity it is played with such charm it is difficult not to fall in love with it all. This is such a different world, with it's well to do manners and aristocratic inklings, but to escape into this is wonderful.The film never gets bogged down into sentiment nor does it become too serious, with the array of charming and harmless characters played by some of the cream of British actors, including a young Daniel Day Lewis and the always brilliant Dame's Judi and Maggie, the film is made enjoyable because of this and never becomes too stuffy, which period dramas have a habit of. The final scene of the young lovers sitting on the window with the Duomo is one of the most perfect scenes in a film you'll ever likely to see.

44,copperncherrio,Classic Helena Bonham Carter,6,13 March 2011,"I've really been in a bit of a crack of Helena Bonham Carter period pieces lately. Howard's End, Wings of a Dove (or something like that) and Room with a View have been surprising and put me into an overlapping Emma Thompson niche as well. I may be regressing to my younger days, when small period dramas where a thrill. When intimate relations was defined by being alone with a man or when social taboo was a simple kiss.I use to despise such period pieces until I watched Gosford Park and Quills (though not in one sitting). So when watching this film, I guess I was just looking for good old drama with semi-insightful dialogue. This film is for gals who enjoy chick flicks in unrequited shame. I also revel in how thick Helena's eyebrows are.Well, for a period piece there is a handful of good (if not great) actors, as well as good conversation in the realm of love.",A Room with a View
45,Hotwok2013,My Own Personal All-Time Favourite Movie.,10,7 August 2020,"""A Room With A View"" is that rarest of movies where everything comes together perfectly. The cinematography is beautiful, it boasts a great cast and is a also a great love story wonderfully well told, in my opinion. Helena Bonham-Carter was a very lucky young lady indeed to get the lead role of Lucy Honeychurch. She looks every inch the part and plays it extremely well. The man who falls for her George Emerson is played by Julian Sands and is equally good. Probably the best piece of acting in the entire movie is given by Daniel Day-Lewis playing the snobbish, foppish Cecil Vyse who also loves Lucy but is eventually rejected. There are smaller parts for a wealth of great actors and actresses including Dame Judy Dench, Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliott, and Simon Callow all of whom are just perfect in their respective roles. Even the smallest roles have been well cast and acted and I cannot praise this movie too highly. The first part of the movie is set with it's characters on holiday in Italy and contains some stunningly beautiful photography. It also contains my favourite ever romantic scene from any movie. Lucy Honeychurch is seen walking through a poppy-field dressed in a long white dress. She looks like a painting done by one of the french impressionists. The scene is filmed to a stunningly beautiful aria sung by Kiri Te Kanawa. The piece of music is from Puccini's opera ""La Rondine"". George Emerson picks her up and passionately kisses her. It is an absolutely delightful piece of work!. Even after they return home to England the scenery is still great and wonderful to look at. Absolutely love this Edwardian period drama by Merchant Ivory Productions and I really cannot understand why some reviewers have disliked it and thought it boring.",A Room with a View
46,benbrae76,Dullsview.,4,30 April 2010,"I've always found the works of Forster utterly dreary, purposeless, and without passion, or I should say with a strangled passion. This movie completely captures his predictable time-wasting tale, his mostly meaningless dialogue, his lifeless cardboard cut-out characters, and the inevitable ennui, with all the seemingly disinterested actors sleepwalking through most of it. There is a need for good direction and the distinct lack of it is very evident. The only thing really going for the movie is the photography, the costumes, and the settings. Forster himself would have nodded off, and even he deserves better treatment than this movie adaptation of his novel gives. There may be a little excitement for the ladies with a full male-nudity bathing scene, but that's as hot as it gets. The rest of it is pure Dullsville.",A Room with a View

48,Lee-107,Helena Bonham-Carter in one of the most underrated performances of all time!,10,1 November 2008,"'A Room with a View' has won several nominations and awards I read from the IMDb page on the film but not one of those nominations or awards is for Helena Bonham-Carter - the leading lady of this Merchant-Ivory classic. To my mind this is her film. Helena has become very popular now - especially since appearing in many Tim Burton films, her take on Harry Potter's Bellatrix Lestrange and what not... but I still love her earlier films... her turn as Ophelia in Mel Gibson's 'Hamlet', 'Howard's End' another Merchant-Ivory film and this of course. In 'A Room with a View' she invests Lucy's character with such sublimity, such spontaneity, unbridled innocence and blitheness that's just spell binding... May be it was because this was Helena's second movie, may be it was because she was almost exactly the same age as her character, I don't know... but her rendition is almost effortless. Is that why her contribution to this movie was so overlooked? Perhaps. To me it appears one of the most glaring omissions of all time right up there in whichever.com's list of ""50 Actors Who Got Cheated Of Their Award""! That said, this is an ensemble piece and no better set of actors could have done more justice in supporting the leads than those here. We have a medley of stereotypes here but you know what, that's OK when you have the stereotypes played to the tee and with such perfection! So we have a middle-aged unmarried novelist of popular romance who thrives on the escapades and the scandals of those who unwittingly oblige her all the time. Judi Dench, one in many of her supporting roles which don't get enough screen time but do get awards! We have a shrewish spinster who in spite of being unnervingly exacting in her views has a healthy appetite for the gossip doled out by her novelist friend. Hear! Hear! Maggie Smith nose upturned to perfection! And we have the brilliant as always Daniel Day-Lewis who sinks his teeth into Cecil, the uptight, erudite, stiff to the point of being caricature-ish fiancé of Lucy. We all know his method acting, his research into his characters and all. Over here he is a blast to behold! To see him willingly make such an ass of himself is absolutely magical! I couldn't stop laughing seeing him struggle with a tea cup in one hand, swatting flies with another. I was laughing so hard, I had to pause my DVD 'cos I really wanted to take in everything that Julian Sands's character was talking at the moment! The rest of the supporting cast - Simon Callow as Mr. Beebe, Denholm Elliott as Mr. Emerson, Rupert Graves as Lucy's brother Freddy, Rosemary Leach as Lucy's mother - everyone is just so true to their character - acting as such perfect catalysts in what happens in the end, it's almost perfect... If one really goes to see, every one of the supporting actors has some role to play in bringing Lucy and George Emerson together - Judi Dench's character stirs Lucy's repressed feelings for George thanks to her ""Under the Loggia"", Maggie Smith's conservative Charlotte has perhaps the most important role to play in first setting the lovers apart and then trying to bring them together, Daniel Day-Lewis's Cecil is very obviously meant as a foil to George's character - it is not until Lucy gets ready to marry him - ""Inglese-Italianato"" and all - that she realizes or is made to realize that she wants exactly the opposite! Even Mr. Beebe with his very open pro-Emerson-ness, George's father with his unrefined uncomplicated simplicity, Freddy and Lucy's mother whose fondness for the Emersons cementing their acceptance in Lucy's mind... it's like, as they say, everyone including Cecil, conspire to bring Lucy and George together! Lastly, Julian Sands. This is the only film of his which I have seen and he's really amazing as George. I mean, if any actor can manage to distract your attention from Daniel Day-Lewis means he's done one heck of a job! His relationship with his father is very endearing but that I think is more because of Denholm Elliott's really touching performance than Julian's. Even so, when you're watching the film, you really want Julian's character to be with Lucy - and while she's being all cold and stand-off-ish, it's he who makes us root for him all the way! I haven't read E M Forster's novel which for someone who's studied English Lit for five years is rather shameless I admit. The title I am sure is metaphorical... reading the novel would perhaps give me better insight into that... it's more than just the view of the Arno in Florence that Lucy gets to see. It's her view of everything and everyone up until that point in her life that sort of undergoes this transformation because of one fateful change of a room that offers a spectacular view! 'A Room with a View' is another gem in the Merchant Ivory canon - it is a quintessential Merchant Ivory film and god bless them for all they have offered through their wonderful films that so convincingly transport you to another place and time almost making you reluctant to come back to normal life!",A Room with a View
49,Andreapworth,NEVER GET TIRED of this wonderful film,10,17 February 2011,"Although I've seen it many times, I stumbled upon it on TMC the other night, and although it was late, absolutely HAD to watch it all again. Maybe I should buy my own copy???Daniel Day-Lewis is the most 'sublime' and although he was offered the role that went to Julian Sands, he chose Cecil. And his acting speaks quiet volumes when Lucy has refused him and before going up to his bedroom, sits on the stair and calmly puts on his shoes.The music, the scenery, and the period feel of the entire movie is just so perfect. So no wonder I didn't go to sleep, even though I've seen the movie 30+ times. It's just that good!! Denhom Elliot must also be mentioned - it was once said of him ""don't ever get in a scene with him or a cute animal because nobody will pay attention to the other 'star'.",A Room with a View
50,markmuhl,Three naked men in a pond,8,16 August 2018,"I shall be forgiven for using this somewhat odd headline (as an analogy to a famous book written by Jerome K. Jerome) but the one scene with the 3 naked men (one of them being a vicar) taking a bath in a pond and chasing each other around it is quite striking, because it does not really fit in with the prudery from the rest of the movie and it also illustrates that the whole story does not lack a certain sense of humour.I had the movie in good memory from my first watching in the movie-theatre back in the eighties and I was not disappointed now when streaming it, although I realized only this time that it is in fact a coming-of-age story besides being a period movie. It is the story of a well-educated teenager from the Edwardian period who has yet to learn to listen to her heart instead of trying to meet the expectations that strict society rules seem to demand from her. This is not such an easy achievement if you were raised in those days where society rules plaid a much bigger role than today and if you had always a chaperon next to you. Then there was the great financial dependence of women, which may have made them consider proposals in a positive way which they would not have otherwise. This must be taken into account to understand why Lucy at first accepted the engagement to Cecil (great performance by Daniel Day Lewis), a textbook example snob but wealthy enough for not having to work. Cecil however, is not the only snob in the movie. It seems that snobbery was quite widespread in the English upper classes in those days and the film is quite good in making fun of it, especially in the Italian scenes at the beginning. Less convincing in my eyes is the stabbing scene in the center of Florence with a young Italian guy getting killed out of the blue, which makes Lucy faint and fall into the strong arms of George. Also the fact that George and Lucy meet again in England seems to be a bit too coincidental (according to George it is fate) but on the other hand coincidents do happen and if so they are likely to be narrated.Anyway, it is quite enjoyable to watch unfold the obstacles to a love story in a period only about 110 years from now. There is already bicycles, trains and even tennis so that it is more the changes in society which makes it seem such a faraway time.",A Room with a View

55,endymion82,A Celebration Beauty and Truth,10,25 November 2000,"This has been my favorite movie for ten years, and it continues to hold the title every time I see it. Unlike many other films, it just gets better with each viewing, and like a good piece of classical music or art, the more I come to understand the film, the more I get out of it and love it. Truly one of the most flawless works I've ever come across- the acting is superb from minor to major players, the screenplay a deft adaptation of a great book, the art direction and costumes worthy of the Oscars they won, the score sweeping and romantic, and the filming gorgeously visual. A ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of the few movie adaptations of a book that succeeds not only in being a good rendition of the original text, BUT A GREAT MOVIE IN AND OF ITSELF. It was made for love, to be loved, and the fact that it is so generally successful is just icing on the cake. As a romance, it's astoundingly successful, and though a period piece, its central philosophy of joy and passion are completely timeless, though maybe too subtle for our somewhat cynical modern intelligentsia/art house crowd, and it's definitely too complex and honest for a typical date movie audience. If, however, you're looking for an intelligent, genuine, well-crafted film that will make you laugh, fall in love with the characters and their time period, and then keep you up at two in the morning... well, this one's worth checking out.",A Room with a View
56,critical-escapist,Blends itself easily from costume drama to romantic comedy,7,8 October 2005,"I borrowed this film from my local library because I was to make caps for my Helena Bonham Carter fan site (which is run at the lowest budget possible).Anyway, A Room with a View, another E.M. Foster adaptation looks into choices and decisions, much like Howards End, which also starred Helena Bonham Carter, and was an E.M. Foster adaptation, and also was a Merchant Ivory production. This film is a very standard costume drama, mixed with romantic comedy. I'm not the hugest fan of both, but I watched it anyway because of Helena because she is one of my favorite actresses and she steals almost every single scene in this film.Carter stars as Lucy Honeychurch, a young woman who goes to Florence as a tourist guided by her proper Aunt Charlotte. There she meets the Emersons, who offers the two women a ""room with a view"" because their rooms had a view and Lucy's and Charlotte's did not. The situations concludes in a romance between Lucy and George Emerson  that saddest part is that I wasn't that interested in the two because I thought George was quite annoying (not because of Julian Sand's performance, though). When Lucy goes back home, she finds a more ""proper"" suitor, Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis) who is as we call ""self obsessed."" Cecil is educated and loves books and loves himself even more. I wouldn't call this a love triangle though. Cecil doesn't really care for Lucy, as we all know, but he is welcomed into the family with open arms. George comes into view and he tires to break the engagement somehow. As well know, he will break the engagement because Cecil is too much of a brat for any of us to really love.The only thing I liked about this film was Daniel Day-Lewis who is very funny as Cecil. I think he must be the funniest character in the film. He is so self-obsessed and conceited that you just have to like him. I never thought of Lewis as a comedic actor, but here he proves he can be whatever actor he likes. Maggie Smith is also very good as Charlotte  somewhat funny and misunderstood in a way, but you kind of like her. Mr. Emerson, played by Denholm Elliot is also pretty good and believable as the father trying to teach his son the tactics of the world. Julian Sands, as I said  I thought George was rather annoying. I wished they would have had made Rupert Graves as George and Julian Sands as Freddy Honeychurch. Graves and Carter show much more chemistry in the scenes where they are together as brother and sister because those scenes are extremely sweet. Not to mention Judy Dench was pretty funny as the writer at Florence.This is pretty sweet for a costume drama. When I think costume drama, I usually think Howards End or some Shakespearean adaptation, but this film is somewhat witty. I'm afraid to say I was a bit bored at some point. The film starts out really slowly and it feels as if the beginning would never end. In the middle, they kind of suck you into the story then you think, ""Ah, I get it."" The cast assemble is really good, and the costumes and stage design is good as well. James Ivory does his special ""This is a Merchant Ivory Production"" touch onto the film. This film runs like a prose almost and the dialogue is extremely engaging. I wished the film interested me all the way through, though. But other than that, this is an acceptable film that anyone can watch and enjoy (well, it depends what you mean by everyone)",A Room with a View
57,jdberkley,That rarest of great novel adaptations-- a film that's better than the book,10,20 September 2002,"No disrespect to the achingly elegant prose of E.M. Forster, but the last chapter of his novel simply cannot compare to this film's last shot, of a pair of lovers in a pensione in Florence, finally with their view of the Arno. As for the rest of this brilliant adaptation, it is populated with actors so perfectly cast it's as if they'd been invented for the roles-- Julian Sands as the Edwardian bohemian George Emerson, Helena Bonham-Carter, radiant as Lucy Honeychurch, Denholm Elliott, once again stealing every scene he's in, and Daniel Day-Lewis as the priggish Cecil Vyse, in a performance so self-consciously stiff he looks as though he were taken off the cover of the New Yorker. It's romantic, funny, stylish and impassioned. I first saw this film when it was released, and even at a young age, I knew I'd fallen in love. Twenty years later, I'm still in love with it.",A Room with a View

I don't see much else beyond a very ordinary boy-meets-girl plot.  I have only seen this film once, so there are probably nuances I've missed. But I think there are much better nostalgic movies about the English upper classes as they never were, such as ""A Passage to India"" or (if it counts as a movie) ""Brideshead Revisited"".",A Room with a View
60,lllinggg,Charming Despite its Flaws,5,21 January 2004,"In addition to being a delightful comedic romance, 'Room With A View' is an illuminating deconstruction of class relations in Edwardian Britain. While touring Tuscany, genteel lady Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) meets middle class youngster George Emerson (Julian Sands). Captivated by his liberal and liberated aura, Lucy questions the repressive tenets of her leisure-class environment, as personified by her engagement to scholarly aristocrat Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis).Based on a novel by E.M. Forster, the film's elaborate screenplay elevates a simple concept into a captivating study of human relations as balancing between primordial personal desires and shifting social expectations. The splendid cinematography is complemented by the enthralling performances of an all-star supporting cast -including a memorable Simon Callow and a mesmerizing Daniel Day-Lewis. James Ivory's mundane direction will frustrate those familiar with some of his finer works, and one could find one's patience tested by Julian Sands' deficient delivery. The film, however, manages to charm despite these shortcomings, primarily because it operates -and can be enjoyed- on many different levels. A worthy envoy for British cinema, six stars out of ten.",A Room with a View
61,DizzyDitz,Dazzling Comedy of Manners,10,2 March 2002,"A room with a view is a tale of passion hidden as a comedy of manners. Helena Bonham-Carter is gorgeous as Lucy, a constrained English girl who is vacationing in Italy, closely guarded by her pathetically uppity elder cousin Charlotte. Everything is dazzling in this film from the sumptuous Italian setting to classical music to the Victorian costumes(and Helena Bonham-Carter's hair). The characters are all hilarious in their individual parts, but Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show with his portrayal of Cecil Vyse, an insufferably narcissistic gentleman of birth and breeding.The film can best be summarized by the Rev. Mr. Beebe's comment, that if Ms. Honeychurch ever takes to living as she plays[the piano], ""it will be very exciting"". Like a work of Beethoven among music is ""A Room with a View"" among movies. Please watch.",A Room with a View
62,GirlwonderReturns,The best period film ever made...period.,9,12 October 2001,"This was my best friend's most favorite film back when we were in high school, and for over a year I refused to watch it. What was the point? I was a 17-year-old heavy metal fan; period dramas were stuffy and joyless, something that I only watched when I was forced to by parents or teachers.
Well, finally I relented and agreed to give it a shot...and ended up loving it even more than she did. Everything about this movie is wonderful; it's funny, romantic, wise, and touching. The cast simply couldn't be better - I especially liked Dame Maggie Smith as Charlotte Bartlett, Denholm Elliott as the wonderful Mr. Emerson, Simon Callow as the Reverend Beebe, and Rupert Graves as the irrepressible Freddy Honeychurch, although similar kudos must be given to Helena Bonham Carter, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Julian Sands. The love story is wildly romantic without also being painfully sappy. And the message is wise, loud and clear: life without passion is not really life at all.

I think if I had been told it was a romantic ""comedy"" I would have been much more inclined to like it as a comedy, but certainly not as a serious romantic drama like for instance North and South or A Royal Affair. Maybe for the English this IS a serious drama. But for me it was just silly and well, odd.I truly do not get all the rave reviews and remarks about this movie. I just found it goofy and weird. If you like that, I think you would like it for the goofy, odd humor. But as a serious drama, pass.I mean seriously many times I felt really icked out by a few of the characters. Like Mr. Beebe. He almost seemed like a fetishist or something. He gave me the creeps so I think it made it even more difficult to watch with his parts especially the way he talked about such a young girl.

I can not even figure out its genre. It is not a drama and I am shocked that anyone would describe it as a comedy. It is a full length feature film about a stolen kiss. Beautiful scenery, music and clothing are used to disguise the fact that there is no story, no suspense, no emotion, nothing. I can only conclude that the people who like this movie like movies about nothing. It is the Seinfeld joke in the form of a movie – a movie about nothing. I also think there are people nostalgic for the innocence of this bygone era. The fact that this movie has never to my knowledge appeared on any sort of great films list, not even for the 80's, is just proof of the fact that it was over-rated at the time and now has largely been forgotten. This is I think the fate of Merchant Ivory films, to be forgotten.",A Room with a View

James Ivory painted a beautiful, romantic landscape that will melt anybody's heart. Plus, Puccini's O Mio Babbino Carro from Gianni Schicchi  played to great effect. Watching this film makes one wish of falling in love in Italy at the turn of the century. Simply magical. Watch it with someone special.",A Room with a View
66,FilmFanatic09,A Room with a View,9,8 December 2006,"""A Room with a View"" is certainly a film rarity, in that this adaptation fully lives up to an expectations set by E.M. Forster's classic novel. The film is set during the Edwardian period, a time marked by the replacing of Victorian ways with more liberal ideals. This idea is personified by the static characters of freethinking George Emerson (Julian Sands) and prudish Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day Lewis). Between these two extremes, we find our heroine Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter), a young woman with a zest for life, but unsure of exactly what to do with it. In referencing her skills at the piano, one character puts it quite nicely, ""If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting- both for us and her."" It proves to be exciting for the audience too, as we watch her coming of age through fascinating interactions with both fiancée Cecil, and George, the young man she meets while abroad in Italy. It certainly doesn't hurt that these interactions are staged against some of the most beautiful scenery ever seen on the screen. Watching segments of the film with no sound could serve as an effective travelogue for Florence, Italy or Surrey, England. Of course that is just an added bonus, as it is Forster's characters who make the film come so alive. In addition to the three points of the love triangle, veteran actors such as Judi Dench, Denholm Elliot, and Maggie Smith give such performances that upon rereading the novel, I suspect it would be an impossible task to imagine these characters any other way. In addition to the perfect ensemble cast, directing/producing team Ismail Merchant and James Ivory give absolute proficiency to their adaptation of the novel. All the right scenes are there. (We forgive them for a slight alteration to the classic ""kiss in field of violets"" scene, as violets were not in season during production.) Dialogue is taken directly from the pages of the novel. And they show boldness in their unrestrained filming of a playful skinny-dipping sequence. I suppose it would be hypocritical to shoot a scene lampooning repression in a repressed manner, however. The basic story of ""A Room with a View"" is one which may have been told before, but like that special parent or teacher we all had growing up, this film tells that story better than anyone else could ever hope to. Its characters, their sensibilities, and their nuances enchant us. The entire production is a shining example of period film-making and the finished product is one worthy of repeated viewings. It truly gets better each time you see it. You'll notice more too. For instance, pay attention to Lucy's love scenes with her two men, particularly what transpires and whether they take place in or out of doors. It is a testament to the adapters, that other such literary elements from the novel remain intact here. In short, Forster laid the blueprint from which these filmmakers built a tour de force.",A Room with a View

It was subtle, and it did not have the sex and, or violence that most love stories on film consider necessary to hold an audience. It is entertaining, sweet, and satisfying.  The cast is great, the acting is great, and the story is great-Everything is GREAT! I've enjoyed this movie for a while, now, and I don't get too tired of it. It is rare for me to actually care about characters, forget about like them. I cared if the two would end up together.  I was happy with the ending, and I did like all of the characters.

69,busy-boy,A True Sleeper,1,16 February 2010,"To this day, RWAV draws reverence as a seminal work, even being studied in film classes. It certainly broke many rules of film-making. Hardly any scene moved the plot along. Actually, there was no plot. The main action revolved around one chance encounter. The film favors style over substance and becomes not much more than a snapshot of an era. Think of one of those early Edison films; four minutes observing a Manhattan street corner in 1890. Fascinating, but tedious at an hour and a half.Merchant Ivory are to be commended for what is probably a very faithful depiction of the Edwardian era, but modern audiences have simply seen too much and lived too fast to accept the ponderously slow pace of this 100 year old lifestyle. Pity, really. I pity myself for being unable to truly jump back into these slow times and endlessly fascinate on the minutiae of one young woman's romantic notions. The slowdown would probably do me good. As it was, it gave me about an hour's fitful sleep in an uncomfortable theater seat. Kudos to those who felt invigorated and restored by this work.

Memorable settings in a languid pre First World War Italian summer, coupled with costumes and set design really capture the period feel of this movie very well.An excellent performance by Maggie Smith as the prim and proper Charlotte Bartlett determined that her young companion Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) will gain the educational benefits of the 'Grand Tour' and conduct herself in a proper manner, and a very contained performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as the reserved suitor Cecil Vyse.  The blossoming of Lucy Honeychurch and her awakening passion is a highlight of the film.Another excellent Merchant/Ivory period movie, I gave it 10 out of 10.",A Room with a View
71,crossing_lethe,A Timeless Masterpiece,10,8 August 2005,"""A Room with a View"" has a kind of dream-like fairy tale quality to it. It's romantic and funny while still working within the framework of a drama. This is NOT an Edwardian Julia Roberts/Meg Ryan movie. Neither is it a historical melodrama. While probably earning the title of 'chick flick', this certainly doesn't feel like one. This is the kind of romantic movie that you don't feel the need to justify your love for it.Everybody rises to the challenge with their characters, from central roles such as those played by Daniel Day-Lewis, Helena Bonham-Carter and Julian Sande to the smaller characters played by Judi Dench and Rupert Graves. The scenery is beautiful and the music adds to the experience wonderfully. In some ways, this movie doesn't have that typical ""costume drama"" feel to it - while being set in a certain period in history, ""A Room with a View"" feels rather timeless. One doesn't feel the social and cultural differences of the era as much as one might while watching ""Pride and Prejudice"" or even ""Maurice"" - a second E.M. Forster novel adapted by Merchant Ivory. Whether or not this is a good thing depends on the viewer. Regardless of preferences, I fully recommend ""A Room with a View"" to anyone who enjoys light romantic comedies that don't resort to being silly and contrived.",A Room with a View
72,giolittigiovanni,Useless and stereotypical description of Italy,4,19 August 2008,"Although I must admit that James Ivory is faithful to the novel, I positively dislike this movie. I hate the way the director insists on depicting us Italians in such a disgusting and conventional way.(see the brawl in Piazza de' Signori)I shouldn't put the blame on Ivory since Forster,the author of the the novel who was adapted for the screen,did the same. Neither the Americans nor the English have ever been to admire or at least to depict Italy without recurring to stereotypes and this movie makes no exception. The Academy Award member tend to award those Italian movies which are set during World War Two or sooner because they don't and won't know the present day Italy. Has there ever been an Italian writer or director who has ever conceived to write a novel or a play or a script set in Great Britain or in the US stuffing it with stereotypes like fish and chips and Shakespeare as far as Great Britain is concerned or crowded with cowboys and Indians if it had been set in the USA? The answer is NO. So why can't the English in this case since we're talking about A Room With a View learn to study the real essence of a people and forget the old and ridiculous paraphernalia? A Room is nothing but an anticipation of the Dead Poets' Society. Freedom from restriction. Lies and chatting!

The cast was incredible (especially Maggie Smith as the annoying ""poor Charlotte""). Also the directing, writing, and technical values are all note-worthy. This movie is a good example of a period piece that delights yet at the same time remains true to the spirit of the era it depicts and the source material.

To venture off to Florence.  To play tennis with Freddy, Lucy, and George.  To play comical songs on the piano which drives Cecil crazy. To  believe not in world sorrow as I play Beethoven. To poke fun at ""poor"" Charlotte Bartlett.The adaptation from novel to screen is phenomenal.  The Eternal Why.  If only I could find such love as George and Lucy.

He knows what he wants - Lucy Honeychurch - and goes about getting her in a very direct fashion.  A simple plot, yes, but considering this all takes place in the Edwardian era much confusion and delight arises.  Young men cannot simply decide they like a young lady (and kiss them in a waving field of barley) and expect no repercussions from the said lady and her most excellent chaperone Miss Charlotte Bartlett.  What ensues is a wonderful comedy of manners and characters, coupled with a very winsome romance.  Mix in a busybody parson, an over-the-top lady novelist, a philosophising father, Italy and the piano sonatas of Beethoven and you have the best movie of 1985 (and yes, better than Platoon).The cast is uniformly wonderful, especially Maggie Smith as Charlotte Bartlett, and Daniel Day Lewis as the fuddy-duddy fiance.

As if you didn't see that coming. Predictable to the extreme.Being forced to watch it in English class didn't help. Being surrounded by 30 other people who all thought it was adorable only accelerated my forming of the opinion that this movie is over-rated, not just plain boring. Every time George kissed Charlotte the 30-girl chorus of ""awww"" just made me want to be sick into my own scorn. Generic romance such as this does not deserve analysis and class time. It doesn't even deserve to be made, and it certainly doesn't deserve any awards nominations!To anyone who hasn't seen it, don't.

86,Cverian,A room with a glimpse,6,20 July 2017,"The reason why people are constantly comparing this to Jane Eyre is beyond me. I couldn't care less about how beautiful Italy is because I myself was born there, and the cast is something that I seldom rate compared to the writing. it's hard for me to label this a ""romance"" when there barely was any interaction and zero chemistry between the unlikable characters: Lucy is a one-dimensional, annoying and irresponsible girl, which obviously, since the target audience is supposed to be naive little girls, experiences a sudden epiphany that makes her realize her mistakes and just how dumb she has been throughout the whole movie (how can you dislike this masterpiece?), Cecil is a complete and utter plot device, whose sole function is to drive the story to an end, being a downright flat stereotype of a snobby English gentleman, George is... who's George again? Oh, right, the ""nice guy"" who is supposed to hook up with the protagonist somehow, in spite of being uninteresting and bland, I don't think the other characters even had a purpose to begin with, so I'm not going to make a list of them. The romantic side of the movie doesn't show up until the latter half, which is slightly too late for my standards. The ending is very predictable and quite disappointing. Calling this movie ""romantic"" would be like trying to squeeze orange juice out of a prune, side effects included. According to the reviews above me I can speculate that the users who enjoyed this fall into two different categories: first there are people who watched it into their childhood/adolescence, who probably have completely forgotten about this movie, nevertheless they're inclined to rate it highly regardless of the way their opinion changed in their current age, no critical thinking whatsoever. The latter category is unable to find the flaws in this movie because they're blinded by the beauty of the colors and the setting, often coming with an extreme fawning of the actors and their performance. It was hilarious to see the characters mentioning Italian literature and culture, however, my chuckles only lasted twice or thrice. I would have appreciated it more if the movie kept being on its funny side, rather than degenerating in a dull romance. But then again, the majority of the reviews above me hardly feature any statement that isn't made with the mental age of 12, and is the reason I'm prone to distrust IMDb, especially when it comes to movies whose rating is higher than 7.0.",A Room with a View

89,belfman,A magnificent!!!! film which like Yasujiro Ozu's Late Spring is a movie which I must watch at least once every year.,10,28 December 2001,"Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, and Denholm Elliot bring passion, soul and heart to a story that continues on every viewing to touch something inside me, that stirs my own feelings as it does the characters in the film.In many ways, an almost flawless film with superb directing and acting by all. A great chance to see magnificent supporting performances from Daniel Day Lewis, Judi Dench, and Simon Callow. Maggie Smith does her standard role of the repressed, repressing, and self-flagellating chaperone/martyr, which here works effectively as it gives Helena Bonham Carter something to react against.The direction finds the perfect note to contrast the physical sensibilities of the Italian culture with the properness of upper class British moralities.The passion forthcoming in the understatement found all the way around is palpable in nearly every scene.",A Room with a View
90,niffer2,Victorian vs. Edwardian,10,11 May 2006,"This may seem like a minor distinction to some, but it's worth noting that this movie is set in Edwardian (1908) times, not Victorian. This is the crux of the social commentary in the book (and, by extension, the film). Charlotte and Cecil are relics of Victorian stodginess, and George is the wave of the future. The line ""The possession of leisure is a wonderful thing"", when directed at Cecil, is a tongue-in-cheek insult. In 1908, ""gentlemen"" were giving way to a merchant class that respected those who earned their keep.Consider that in 1885, Victorian Lucy would have fainted dead away if she saw George skinny dipping - or she would have been expected to fake it. She would not have understood the subtle suggestion that Cecil is probably gay. But our Edwardian Lucy of 1908 laughs, rather than faints, at the pond. She fully understands what George means when he says that Cecil is ""the sort who can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman."" It's perfectly reasonable to expect that many viewers lack this context, and as a result are bored to tears by this film. Those of us who enjoy this sort of thing, however, will find reason to enjoy this film time and time again, year after year.",A Room with a View
91,elplatero,Utterly incomprehensible,1,22 December 2019,"Viewing the 'A Room with a View' on DVD did not compensate for my disappointing read of the novel (which offers more style than substance). Quite the opposite. The film, for all its scenery, its English country houses, its lawns (with tennis), its green landscape, its stuffy interiors, its Edwardian costumes, its unavoidable elderly spinsters, its inescapable piano playing damsel, its snooty, tiresome tittle-tattle about trivialities, for all this and that and the other clichés that are so typical of British historic period dramas, this film is terribly tedious, beyond boring and about as interesting as watching paint dry (to quote Gene Hackman's judgement of Eric Rohmer). So what is the plot about? First there is a kiss, then there is another, and as a result there is the end of one engagement and the beginning of another. That's about it. So how do you fill 112 minutes with that? Easy: you stuff your film with banalities that even in real life would make you walk away yawning with ennui: a room is changed for another (the title), a letter is read, a horse coach is transporting characters from one house to another, tea is drunk, a cigarette is smoked, a book is read, a bike is ridden, a character stumbles on the lawn, another trips between the flowers, yet another goes up the staircase, only to come down again etc.etc. Utter emptiness. The only 'remarkable event' is probably the skin dipping and running around naked of three men in nature, a scene that is so insufferably long drawn out that even the slowest of simpletons can not miss the hint that hits him in the face: Forster was a homosexual. Ah! Now I understand! Of course the film is nice visually, but that doesn't make up for the utter void of the plot. So it is utterly incomprehensible for me that this film got some rewards, including three Oscars (one even for the best 'scenario'! Excuse me?) and still get raving reviews from enthusiastic viewers. All the best to them, but this film is not my cup of tea. I rather need a cup of strong coffee to recover from the drowsing state it brought me in.",A Room with a View
92,msparry,My Favorite Movie,10,21 February 2002,"If I HAD to pick my favorite movie, this would be it:  great social commentary, subtle & not so subtle wit, beautiful scenery and set design, fantastic music, and last, but not least, great ensemble acting.",A Room with a View
93,dawnpratt,Very fine adaptation from novel,9,6 January 2003,"Most of the time a book is much better than the movie, but in this case, the movie definitely competes with the quality of the book. E.M. Forster's novel has been finely adapted.  Helena Bonham Carter embodies Lucy Honeychurch's crisis -- caught between the stuffy, proper culture in which she lives and the emergence of her self-awareness.  Other great performances include Maggie Smith as Lucy's aunt and Daniel Day-Lewis, who chamelon-like, inhabits Cecil Vyse.  Moving from beautiful Italian landscapes to the country-side of England, the film is visually beautiful.  It has been one of my romantic favorites since it first was in theaters.",A Room with a View
94,gerald65-319-759736,"Stereotype, but still OK",7,28 May 2017,"E. M. Forster's charming story, Merchant and Ivory add gorgeous Tuscan cinematography, lush opera music, and a cast of talented British actors. Even a skinny-dipping scene is done with enough class that the movie got away with a PG rating (though that probably wouldn't happen nowadays!). In short, Merchant-Ivory makes it look easy—and this ease has led to charges of their films being dull and middlebrow, as well as to many imitators.But this stereotype of ""a Merchant-Ivory film"" fails to mention just how vivid and hilarious ""A Room with a View"" actually is. With scene-stealing actors like Maggie Smith as a prim, passive- aggressive chaperone and Daniel Day-Lewis as a self-centered young man whose every gesture tells of his fastidious rigidity, a rich vein of humor runs through the film. The movie also delights in putting its heroine Lucy (a baby-faced Helena Bonham Carter) in situations that prove awkward, funny, and ultimately invigorating for a well-bred young lady of 1905. Lucy finds herself in a love triangle, with society telling her to choose Cecil (Day- Lewis) but a deeper force pulling her toward the unconventional, moody George Emerson (Julian Sands).A comedy of manners, ""A Room with a View"" is sometimes guilty of seeing its characters as types, rather than people. Even Lucy is not much more than ""the young girl transfigured by Italy"" that Miss Lavish (Judi Dench), a writer of cheap novels, labels her as. Still, it's easy to get caught up in the romance of this delightful movie. After seeing it, you'll want to go out and defend Truth and Love from all those who would deny them. Or at least to start saving up for a trip to Italy.",A Room with a View
95,abbynyc,romantic and funny,9,1 April 2004,"This movie made me go to Florence, Italy. And once I got there, they actually showed it every other night at the pensione I stayed in. Though set in Victorian times, it is reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel- romantic and humorous, but more passionate. Characters are lovingly made fun of. The acting is wonderful. People you've seen elsewhere, but in unusual roles. Helena Bonham Carter is the confused heroine, Maggie Smith plays her passive-aggressive aunt, you won't believe it's Daniel Day-Lewis playing the most irritating pompous man, Judi Dench is a gossipy romance novelist, Julian Sands is adorably weird, and the supporting characters are also wonderful. It's one of favorites.",A Room with a View
96,janebanks72,Movie's not as faithful to the ending of the book as everyone is saying,9,18 November 2005,"i love this film, but i can't help being a little concerned that everyone is saying what a faithful representation it is of the novel. the novel **does not have** a cut-and-dried happy ending. at the closing of the novel is a line that reads something like ""She had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps forever."" Lucy's family disapproves of her marriage to George. while she and George are completely in love, the disapproval of her family prevents the book from ending on a 100% happy note. the ending of the movie is a purely happy ending--and well done, and lovely. this is a wonderful film. it does capture the tone of the book marvelously well. the casting is perfect. Maggie smith is just wonderful. i hope her prominent role in the harry potter films will cause people who might not have seen ARVAV to discover this lovely film.",A Room with a View
