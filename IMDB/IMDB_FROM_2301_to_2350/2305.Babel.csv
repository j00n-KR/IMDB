0,MartinHafer,Rather hard to describe but good.,8,14 July 2013,"""Babel"" is an unusual style film. Now I am not saying it's unique--there are other films like this that are made up of seemingly disparate stories that all end up tying together by the end--such as the multi-Oscar winning ""Crash"". This makes it quite unusual and the acting make it well worth seeing.The film begins in Morocco and ultimately results in a senseless shooting of an American tourist. How and why this also results in the film episodically ending up in San Diego, Mexico and Tokyo is just something you'll need to see for yourself.As I mentioned above, the acting is the big reason to see this one. Although there are some big name actors in this one (most notably Brad Pitt), these actors are nice because they are not the BIG STARS in the film--just actors acting naturally among a cast of many excellent minor actors and non-actors (like many of the Moroccans). All create a very realistic looking film--which I like.Now I am not saying the film is perfect (hence my score of 8). A few of the characters (such as the deaf Japanese girl) behave very oddly. Another example is the Mexican lady who runs AWAY from the road into the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night (why?!?). There also was a lot of very explicit nudity--something that might limit its overall appeal. Still, well worth seeing and a very unusual sort of ensemble film.",Babel
1,TheLittleSongbird,Fascinating and often beautiful,8,9 June 2017,"'Babel' is not one of Alejandro González Iñárritu's best films and falls short of being a masterpiece. It does however show how immensely talented he is as a director who to me has not made a bad film, 'Babel' while divisive is still a very good film that's fascinating and often beautiful. Even when Iñárritu is at his weakest or not at his best he is much better than most directors at their worst.Not without its faults. 'Babel' is a little overlong and the ending is abrupt. A couple of parts are on the contrived side. 'Babel' is a film where the pros far outweigh the cons, though it is easy why some people would not be, and have not been, totally enamoured by it.It's exquisitely filmed with beautiful and atmospheric settings. Iñárritu's direction is as superbly accomplished as ever. The music is haunting and fits very well, the sound has great authenticity.Scripting is thought-provoking, exploring its themes well and deftly moving between its four stories and characters. 'Babel' is coherently structured, remarkable for more than one story plot going on which don't give an over-stuffed feel thankfully.The acting is one of the best assets. Brad Pitt is a commanding lead, and while Cate Blanchett could have more to do she is a strong presence. Gael García Bernal is more than up to their level. The best performances come from a heartfelt Rinko Kikuchi and a formidable Adriana Barraza.In summary, fascinating and often beautiful. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Babel
2,SnoopyStyle,Half good,6,30 December 2013,"It's four interconnected stories. A Moroccan boy plays around with a gun and shots an American tourist. Susan Jones (Cate Blanchett) is shot while vacationing in Morocco with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt). The nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) is forced to watch their kids, but she takes them to Mexico to her son's wedding. Meanwhile a deaf Japanese girl is sexually frustrated, and the police is looking for him about a gun he gave to a Moroccan.There is too much Babel. The Japanese story is extraneous, and really doesn't fit into the main story. The girl's nudity is ill-fitting. The Mexican story is way over the top. The ending should be much more simplified. The situation at the border is trying too hard. A more easy deportation ending would be so much better.The good part is the Moroccan story, both the locals and Blanchett/Pitt. The other two stories keep sidetracking the main plot. The movie is half good, half overblown.",Babel
3,mark.waltz,A filmed that angered me and made me think on many different levels.,7,8 April 2010,"I can't say that I liked this film because there are many things in it which either upset me or I didn't feel belonged in the film. It is a film which touches many different emotions because of the variety of narratives and themes that the plot deals with. On one hand, it is a film that shows how you sometimes find humanity in the most unexpected of places. On another hand, it shows that sometimes people fall into the depths of despair so drastically that it becomes practically impossible to dig yourself out. It is also about how the most spontaneous choices we make can destroy us and those around us, and how sometimes even the best of intentions can be the worst decisions we ever make.The narrative involves telling several stories from different times and angles. For example, the story of the Moroccan boys with a new rifle is developed to where something bad happens, but the audience is not lead to see what that event is until later when another part of the story leads us to another view of the same incident. Then, the story of the deaf and mute Japanese girl dealing with her handicap is told, and it seems like this plot has no place in the movie. Another story develops with the loving Mexican nanny whose decision to take her wards with her to Mexico for a family wedding ends up destroying her life, even though she did so with the best of intentions. Whatever reason the title ""Babel"" is used, for me, it was meant as a metaphor for the Tower of Babel where a communication barrier creates conflicts that unfortunately cannot be resolved. The American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette) traveling in Morocco must face the differences between their culture and the Muslims, while the two young American children find themselves suddenly trust into the Mexican culture that is somewhat strange, briefly scary (the killing of a chicken), and then fun (the wedding reception). This storyline for me is the most interesting, because it really could have been a separate movie that lead to human rights being fought for because of what happens to the poor Mexican lady who deserved better treatment than she got once her plans to return the children home went haywire. Adriana Barraza gives an amazing performance as the nanny; I thought she was award worthy and was thrilled to find out she got an Oscar Nomination. Not since Louise Beavers and Juanita Moore in both versions of ""Imitation of Life"" has there been such a well developed characterization of the tragedies and struggles of a servant whose devotion to their employers (in this case, Amelia's charges) is so filled with angelic beauty. This character truly is an Angel in America, suffering for being more loving than anybody can imagine.I had a difficult time with the story of the deaf Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi). Yes, I can certainly feel for her loneliness but her seeming obsession with sexual attention was painful to watch, even if it was a pitiful cry for love at any degree. The scene in the dentist's office was particularly sickening to see, even if it shows an accurate account of the depths of despair that this character was going through. Kikuchi is excellent in the role, and it is probably the almost unbearable viewing of her pathetic life that made this role quite challenging and extremely difficult to play. Again, this is another plot which could have been a separate movie, watching this character get the psychological help she needed to move on to accept her deafness and accept herself for who she was. I found it entirely too creepy to watch.There is also a brief sequence that I thought was unnecessary and made me very uncomfortable, watching the young Moroccan boy watching his older sister voluntarily strip naked for him, then him try to relieve himself afterwords. Was this really important to the plot? Not at all, and it sickened me to see this included. Develop these boys story with having the gun and the tragedy it resulted in, but keep the sexual contact out of it. It doesn't belong here.There is the humanity level of the story which finds different nationalities coming together as one. We are reminded here we are not of different race. We are part of the human race, one which I would like to write every time some application asks me to specify. The scenes of the Arabs being more sympathetic to Brad Pitt's plight than the American tourists on the bus was very revealing. Also, how this blew up in the press as well. When a private painful event such as this happens, where should the press draw back? It becomes disgusting every time I see a private citizen's life in the news being invaded when they deserve respect was confirmed in the scenes with Pitt and the press here. This is a film I will have to think a lot about to really confirm how much I like it on the whole.",Babel
4,claudio_carvalho,"Globalization, Lack of Communication and Paranoia in a Powerful Drama",10,7 September 2007,"In Morocco, a shepherd buys a powerful rifle for his sons to protect his herd of goats against jackals attack. The younger decides to test the weapon's range of 3 km and shots an American woman in bus. Her husband is trying the reconciliation of their lives through vacation in Morocco. Due to the incident, in San Diego their Mexican maid travels to Mexico with their children for the marriage of her son. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the police tries to contact the former owner of the rifle, and his daughter that is feeling rejected misunderstand the reason of the investigation.This is the third movie of the brilliant director Alejandro Gonzáles Iñarritu that I watch (plus one short), and all of them have the same characteristics: magnificent and complex screenplays and characters, telling different stories that entwines. The dramatic ""Babel"" is a powerful tale of globalization, lack of communication and paranoia that shows how connected we are with other human beings. Through an accidental shot in Morocco, and complex and well-developed characters, the stunning Iñarritu discloses four entwined stories in four countries affecting the lives of ordinary people mostly because the lack of communication in the present days. In times of Internet, cellular and other efficient means of communication, the human beings seem to have lost the ability to communicate directly to each other. At least, this is the message that I felt in this awesome movie. The Moroccan boys are not comfortable to tell their father that they shot the American tourist; the Moroccan police uses violence to interrogate; the tourists do not show any sympathy with the wounded woman; the deaf and dumb Japanese girl can not communicate with other teenagers, having a rejection process; the Mexican driver can not talk to the abusive American custom guard; even Richard and Susan have problems of communication in their relationship; therefore, they are doomed to not reach heaven due to their inability to communicate to each other, like in the biblical story. Brad Pitt is very mature and his performance is the best that I have seen in years. The soundtrack is amazing, giving a perfect complement to each scene of this perfect film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Babel""",Babel
5,kosmasp,A gripping story,8,2 April 2007,"If you know the directors previous works (Amorres Perros & 21 grams) you kind of know what you're in for. And a popcorn movie this ain't! It's heavy drama, with very good acting in it. You have a few different locations, with different actors. Everyone is speaking in their native language. That means, that unless you are a language expert, you will have to read subtitles! But then again the title is kind of a giveaway. But the direction is wonderful and the stories are well told. No wonder the movie was nominated for so many Oscars. Although I didn't think it would win, that wasn't because I thought the movie didn't deserve it, but because it seemed to be the time of Scorsese! And indeed it was.If you like well told stories and you are not shy of heavy-weight drama, then you should watch this movie.",Babel
6,gavin6942,"Gripping, I Could Not Turn It Off",8,16 June 2011,"Tragedy strikes a married couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) on vacation in the Moroccan desert, touching off an interlocking story involving four different families.While I do not think this film is nearly as good as ""Amores Perros"", it follows a similar formula that pays off well with great interlocking stories and a fantastic international cast. While the central story is the Pitt/Blanchett story, theirs is actually the least interesting.Strangely, the most interesting was the story of the deaf girl in Japan. Her connection to the rest of the film is so minimal that it really serves no purpose. But even so, she has a story to tell and it is an interesting one. And, best of all, she creates mystery as she goes... this story could kick off a sequel (but sadly will not).",Babel
7,lee_eisenberg,life goes grim,9,27 February 2007,"After ""Babel"" won an Oscar for Best Original Score on Sunday, I watched it last night. It is certainly a disturbing movie, portraying four different stories connected by an accidental shooting in rural Morocco. Many people will probably agree that this is one of a growing number of movies with several plots all sharing a common link (along with ""Crash"" and ""Syriana"").The main story - so to speak - involves the husband and wife tourists in Morocco. After Susan (Cate Blanchett) gets mysteriously shot in a tour bus, her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) makes the driver stop in a small village, where he desperately tries to call for help. As they wait for help to arrive, the other passengers get increasingly frustrated about having to stay in this backwards town, to the point where it looks like emotions on all sides might completely boil over.The next story centers on the Moroccan boys who fired the bullet. Hoping to shoot the jackals preying on their sheep, they use a gun sold to them by a Japanese tourist, only to set in motion a series of events touching every corner of the globe. Worse yet, they run the risk of interrogation by the Moroccan police.Then, there are Susan and Richard's children, being cared for by Mexican housekeeper Amelia (Adriana Barraza). When she learns that her son back in Mexico is about to get married, she has to take the children down there with her...only to have an ugly series of events unfold.Lastly, there is Chieko (Rinko Kukuchi), the deaf-mute Japanese girl whose father sold the rifle used in the shooting. Chieko was already an outcast, but the calamity set off half way around the world drives her to the point of near insanity.I would say that Amelia is the most intriguing character in the movie. While each storyline shows people sinking further into desperation, hers is compounded by her status as an immigrant, and the irresponsible actions of her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal). During the whole sequence out in the desert, one can imagine that she must be feeling almost the same thing that Richard and Susan are feeling in Morocco. And the gravity doesn't end there.Is ""Babel"" a perfect movie? Far from it. The story taking place in Japan isn't tied together as well as the other stories. Amelia's nephew also seems like he was added as filler at times. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure that I would have nominated this movie for Best Picture. But other than that, I thought that it was a very well done film, showing the influence of globalization in our modern world. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has once again shown himself to be a very capable director.",Babel
8,jboothmillard,Babel,5,26 June 2007,"From Cannes Film Festival winning, and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams), I admit I was expecting a big deal independent film, but there are still reasons to like it. Basically, some boys in the deserts of Mexico (not too far from their town) are playing with a gun that can shoot shells up to 10 feet, and beings kids they shoot a passing bus. In a flashback (before this moment), you find out a couple from San Diego, California, vacationing in Morocco, are victims to this shot, when the wife Susan (Cate Blanchett) is hit in the neck, and husband Richard (Golden Globe nominated Brad Pitt) is desperate to get help. The other three stories interwoven with this incident are obviously the kids with their father and village, the nanny of Richard and Susan's kids taking them to a wedding, where they also have disaster with one kid dying and the nanny told to deport for being an illegal immigrant, and a Chinese girl in Tokyo is dealing with rejection, after the death of her father, trying everything she can to seduce almost anyone. Also starring Gael García Bernal as Santiago, Koji Yakusho as Yasujiro, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Adriana Barraza as Amelia, Boubker Ait El Caid as Yussef, Said Tarchani as Ahmed, Elle Fanning as Debbie and Nathan Gamble as Mike. Pitt and Blanchett may be the only two actors I actually know (it is good to see familiar faces in a low budget film), but it is an interesting film with almost all filming hand-held, and many of the scenes on location (in the countries). It won the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for Gustavo Santaolalla, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing, and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay.

9,moonspinner55,"Absorbing, extremely well-made, but not likely to be anybody's favorite movie...",6,25 April 2010,"Following ""21 Grams"", yet another gut-wrenching examination of unfair consequence via unfair actions by director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who helped concoct this tapestry with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga. Two Moroccan kids in a mountain region, playing around with their father's newly-acquired rife, shoot at a tour bus and hit an American woman; she's the mother of two kids from San Diego who are being looked after by an Hispanic nanny living in the U.S. illegally; meanwhile, the rifle is traced back to a Japanese businessman whose deaf daughter is desperate to get somebody to notice her. Weaving these stories together in a precisely shuffled format doesn't quite reap the sucker-punch results of ""21 Grams"", mainly due to the American tourists episode (which leaves Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett with very little to do). Also, there is too much of a stop-and-start feel to the drama which, when it isn't being stifled off to bide time, is overlaid with artistic accoutrements. Certainly this is a well-made, well-acted picture--and technically it is quite a marvel--yet as the circle is cannily brought together, one may not find the puzzle as satisfying as the filmmakers apparently do. ""Babel"" is meant to be thought-provoking and unnerving, but there's a straying quality to the storytelling which puts the audience through their own version of hell. **1/2 from ****",Babel
10,Quinoa1984,"ambitious and filled with dramatic power, and if only it could all come together as a whole",7,16 November 2006,"Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu is a gifted filmmaker, and I will continue to look for what he has to offer as a director for years to come. Then again such a big-time adulatory declaration could have also been made after seeing his first film, Amores Perros (which, for my money, is still my favorite). I mention this though because him and his writer Giullermo Arriaga are worthy of their films being dissected and criticized as art and not just throwaway dramatic pieces. In the case of Babel, there was a good deal I did like and get engrossed by, while at the same time not finding it to be completely satisfying. The very over-used statement 'the parts are greater than the whole' is sort of an understatement in the case of Babel. Here, four stories interlock (not confusingly this time and without a real emotional connection like 21 Grams) with the sort of running vein of children and parents (sometimes parents anyway), and how all end up in downward spirals in one way or another. The stories are set in Mexico, Japan, and Morocco- two of them there, where they most connect involving a goat herder's two sons who accidentally shoot at a bus, striking a woman played by Cate Blanchett. As her husband (Brad Pitt) frantically tries to find help in a small village, Inarritu cuts between that and the story of the daughter of the man who originally gave into possession the gun to the Moroccan (Japan), and with the story of Pitt/Blanchett's character's kids, who are taken under no alternative down to Mexico for a wedding.All of this has potential, and a lot of it is tapped. There is only some bits I could complain regarding the Cannes-winning direction (mostly in the over-use of montage, and a particularly tedious and flawed scene in a dance-club that the character in Japan goes in), yet that to me is probably the overall strongest part of what makes Babel watchable and somewhat remarkable. In fact, there are at least a few, if not several, single shots and scenes via the camera-work that are very close to stunning. The acting is something else that comes to mind as being noteworthy, with Pitt not letting his face look as dashing and usually-Hollywood handsome as usual, and going into a fully focused turn as a man in total panic that wipes away anything uneasy he had with his wife. There's even a great scene between the two of them that involves many a tear shed, but it never feels false. And the actress who played the Japanese girl, albeit in a sort of constricted role (we get it, she's blind and a bit nuts), is very able to fill the character with a good deal of sympathy from the audience. There's a real good sense of the ensemble working well off each other too. Its in the storytelling, and the unevenness of the stories, that end up making Babel as frustrating as it is fascinating. On the one hand, one could say that the Japanese story is only loosely and superficially connected with the Moroccan goat-herder storyline, however with some of the very best scenes in the film, like with the detective and the girl in the apartment (the story has its ups and down, but felt possibly like it could be a superb short film if on its own). But on the other hand, a story that seems like it would make much more sense to have it connected with the rest of the picture- the Mexican babysitter's crisis with the children following the wedding- comes off more contrived and too illogical for disbelief. Unlike with another recent film with a kind of spider-web of story lines and characters, Crash, there isn't the sense that the filmmakers are beating you over the head with a particular message- aside from, possibly, to take care of your children and each other, which is a little too sappy to think of. But the same sense that there's something messy to the structure is felt as well, at least for me. Many times I did feel an emotional connection to the characters, and the actors playing them, but with such a loose organizing principle, and other minor liabilities in the direction and musical score, it felt a little overwhelming. Come awards time I wouldn't be surprised if it garnered up a good load of nominations, and on some fronts its worthy. And if once the film gets played on TV I would love to check out certain scenes and moments again. That I wouldn't feel too much of a desire to sit through it again too soon from start to finish though is an unfortunate feeling I got once leaving the theater, seeing a powerhouse almost overwork itself with narrative lapses of reason. I recommend it, but not as strongly as I wish I could.",Babel
11,tavm,Babel is one of the most challenging films of the year,10,28 June 2007,"First off, I'd like to say that both Rinko Kikuchi and Adriana Barraza deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles in Babel this year. And Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett deserve thanks for lending their star power to this picture. Babel is a mostly compelling film about how four different stories taking place in the countries of Mexico, America, Morocco, and Japan are loosely connected. Some of the most interesting sequences concern a Mexican wedding that a nanny (Barraza) from that country takes her American charges (one of whom is Dakota Fanning's sister, Elle) to, and a Japanese deaf-mute teen's (Kikuchi) attempted seduction of the police detective when he arrives at her apartment. This movie can be frustrating to anyone who wants a conventional storyline but it mostly pays off at the end. It's certainly one of the most challenging movies I've seen this year.",Babel

""Crash won the Oscar, but ""Babel,"" which is far better, failed to cop the best picture Oscar this year and a lot of people should start wondering why.A rifle given by a Japanese businessman to a poor Moroccan will soon touch off an international incident. As we live in an age of terror, it is soon believed that terrorism played a part.These inter-connecting stories touching with people of Japan, Morocco and Mexico is extremely well directed with fabulous performances as well as a film that will get you to think.There are such strong emotional ties here. Two impoverished children who inadvertently create a near world-wide crisis, a couple victimized by their senseless act of violence, a young Japanese deaf-mute girl who is severely disturbed and an illegal Mexican maid who made the mistake of her life are so well described here.

13,wes-connors,Sadness is a Warm Gun,6,10 January 2010,"My roughly chronological synopsis makes inferences about events that are only hinted at in the production; but, they are important in understanding motivations, and the overall theme of the interlocking story. We begin with events leading up to those covered, but never shown, on film. DON'T READ ON until after seeing the story, and drawing your own conclusions possibly, in Japan, a young deaf mute girl accidentally shoots her mother dead. The girl had probably mishandled a carelessly placed gun.Some years later, Rinko Kikuchi (as Chieko) is a young woman; she and wealthy father Koji Yakusho (as Yasujiro) have not learned to deal with their loss. This is especially true for Ms. Kikuchi, who seems frozen in adolescence, and unable to fill her loss by satisfying sexual urges. Mr. Yakusho goes on a business trip to Morocco, which involves a hunting safari. Understandably, Yakusho does not want to bring home a rifle he used on the trip - so, he gives it to his guide, Abdelkader Bara (as Hassan Ibrahim).The Arab guide, a good and hard-working man, accepts the rifle as a ""thank you"" gift. But, Mr. Bara does not need the gun as much as he needs money. So, he sells the rifle to likewise hard-working peasant Mustapha Rachidi (as Abdullah Adboum). Mr. Rachidi hopes to shoot some of the jackal threatening his family's goat-herding livelihood. He gives the gun to young sons Boubker Ait El Caid (as Yussef) and Said Tarchani (as Ahmed); but, the boys do not understand firearms, and carelessly shoot at a tour bus.The bullet hits beautiful blonde Cate Blanchett (as Susan Jones), wife of gray-bearded Brad Pitt (as Richard). The couple is in Morocco on a vacation, vaguely hoping to turn the trip into a ""second honeymoon"" and salvage their crumbling marriage. Sometime earlier, they lost a child. Presently, struck by Yussef's bullet, Blanchett begins bleeding to death. With time running out, Mr. Pitt frantically tries to get Ms. Some life-saving health care. They learn the US suspects the shooting is terrorist-related.While Pitt tries to save his wife's life, the couple's two beautiful blonde children are home in San Diego, California. There, they are being cared for by lovable long-term ""illegal immigrant"" nanny Adriana Barraza (as Amelia). But, Ms. Barraza needs to leave for Mexico, and attend her son's wedding. Due to the Moroccan shooting, Pitt is delayed, and Barraza can find no one to watch the children. So, she decides to take the two youngsters off to Mexico, with sexy nephew Gael García Bernal (as Santiago) driving.During the wedding fiesta, Mr. García Bernal gets properly intoxicated. After the celebration, the quartet pile into the car and head home. But, Clifton Collins Jr. and border guards are suspicious; Bernal is still inebriated; and, Barraza is inexplicably introduced as the very Caucasian-looking kids' aunt. Bernal speeds away from the border. The fugitives decide to split up, with Barraza roaming the desert in her red wedding party dress, the children wasting away under a tree, and brother in parts unknown ""Babel"" is a beautifully produced film, with an intriguing non-linear storyline; it leaves a lot to the imagination. Unfortunately, some of the characters' actions are difficult to comprehend. It strains credulity, for example, to witness the seemingly sensible ""nanny"" character making so many stupid decisions. But, the film's main flaw is that, for most of the running time, the picture shakes uncontrollably. The shaky camera is very distracting, occurring even when characters are not on a boat, camel, or drunk.****** Babel (5/23/06) Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ~ Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Rinko Kikuchi, Adriana Barraza",Babel

Richard and Susan's other two children have been left in the care of Amelia, their housekeeper. Amelia is originally from Mexico, and her oldest son is getting married in Tijuana. Unable to find someone who can watch the kids, or to obtain permission to take the day off, Amelia takes the children with her as she travels across the border for the celebration. Around the same time, in Morocco a poor farmer buys a hunting rifle, and he gives it to his sons to scare off the predatory animals that have been thinning out their goat herd. The boys decide to test the weapon's range by shooting at a bus far away; the shot hits Susan in the shoulder, and soon she's bleeding severely, while police are convinced the attack is the work of terrorists. In Japan, Chieko is a teenage deaf-mute whose mother recently committed suicide. This despairing, confused girl experiences such rage and frustration that she causes her volleyball team to lose a match, and later yanks her underwear off and begins exposing herself to boys in a crowded restaurant. Chieko's father then struggles to reach past the emotional distance which separates him and his daughter. The movie is critically acclaimed as it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture — Drama and it was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and two nominations for Best Supporting Actress and has won for Best Original Score.The awards given is definitely worth deserving due to the fact that Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu weaves four of their woeful stories into this mature and multidimensional film.The acting was excellent as well.Despite the fact that is wasn't a commercial success,the movie was a great character-driven masterpiece as Babel, there are no villains, only victims of fate and circumstance.

16,Theo Robertson,What A Poor Year For Movies,5,12 July 2007,"I thought BABEL might be a good movie as I opened the DVD case and put the film into the DVD player . It did after all receive several Oscar nominations including original screenplay , director and picture . Alas after seeing the movie however I realised one thing and one thing only :2006 was one of the worst years for films ever , a fact reflected in that years Oscars I was very disappointed that THE DEPARTED won best film and best director especially when it is obvious that it's by no means a Scorsese masterwork . But the academy probably called it right since it deserved both awards in relation to the other nominees . To be brutally honest BABEL had so many nominations simply to make up the numbers Structure wise the film resembles the previous year's best picture winner CRASH in that several unconnected characters become caught up in events caused by seemingly random actions . Unfortunately unlike the Paul Haggis screenplay you find yourself asking after an hour where these story strands might be heading and if memory serves me right the first dots aren't joined up until about one hour fifteen minutes where a Morrocan goat herder mentions a Japanese tourist . There are a couple of other strands tied up later on but I was way beyond caring at this point It should be also be mentioned that these story strands are rather vague and seem to be included just so the character subplots are tied together . Does that sound silly ? If so ask yourself this : Suppose Richard and Susan didn't have that photograph , do you think the film would have made just as much sense ? Of course not . this isn't intelligent film narrative , it's just an excuse to make a movie with unrelated story arcs . At least CRASH challenges prejudice and surprises the audience with its plot twists . The only thing that surprised me about BABEL is that it received so many nominations , something the producers of THE PRESTIGE and CHILDREN OF MEN are probably slightly angry about Having said that if BABEL got several Oscar nods there must be hope that 28 WEEKS LATER , SUNSHINE and 300 will sweep the academy awards next year",Babel
17,jotix100,International incidents,10,18 November 2006,"Right from the start it should be noted this film is not for everyone. Alejandro Gonzalez Inurritu is a talented director who is always interesting to watch. Working with his collaborator, Guillermo Arriaga, they have produced a haunting film that will be deemed equally satisfying and will divide audiences. The idea behind the movie is the inability of humans to communicate in this complex world of ours. The story begin in Morocco where a man wants to sell his assault rifle to a neighbor with a flock of mountain goats. The seller promises the bullets have a range of three kilometers. The man that buys the rifle has two sons who are the shepherds and tend the goats. Because of the threat of jackals in the area, the boys carry the rifle. As they are trying to learn how to operate, one of the boys decides to see how long will the bullet go and aims at a bus traveling on a road in the distance.The tourist bus traveling through Morocco is full of English speaking tourists. Susan and Richard, two Americans from San Diego, are seen among the passengers. When the shot pierces the window next to Susan, it wounds her in her neck and breaks her clavicle. Richard goes berserk and wants Susan to be taken to a hospital immediately. The passengers in the bus react selfishly. Their only concern is to keep on schedule and the hell with Susan, but the tourist guide tells them about his village nearby where there's a doctor. Richard's reaction is to call home and have relatives contact the American embassy. Suddenly, the incident acquires an aura of terrorism directed to innocent tourists.In the meantime, in California, Amelia, a housekeeper for Susan and Richard, who has been left behind to care for Debbie and Mike, is seen talking to Richard on the phone. Her son is getting married and she wants to go. Richard insists she stays with the children. Amelia's solution is to take the children across the border to Mexico in order to attend the wedding. What starts as a celebration will end badly for this woman that has raised the children since they were born.All the elements in the film connect in Tokyo. Chieko, a young deaf mute teen ager is mourning her mother's death. The woman decided to take her own life probably out of frustration with her own marriage, but we never get to know how. Chieko and her protective father are seen at the girl's school during a game she is thrown out of the game. Chieko and her friends, also deaf and mute, love to hang out where the boys are. One thing lead to another until a local police detective comes knocking at Chieko's apartment door in order to find out if her father had ever given his assault rifle to his guide in Morocco. Chieko, a girl lacking genuine affection from her cold father and having witnessed her mother's suicide decides to let the detective have sex with her, something he refuses. Of course, the film is more complicated than the sum of all its parts, but what comes out is commentary on the way everything seems to be connected, one way, or another. Mr. Gonzalez Inurritu has directed the film moving between the different locations during different periods, not necessarily on a linear narrative, which will create a disconnecting feeling with some viewers not used to the way the director likes to present his films.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, who play Richard and Susan are seen at their best. Not having been a fan of Mr. Pitt, he was a surprise in this movie. Ms. Blanchett's role is not as prominent, but she makes the most out of it. Adriana Barraza, who is seen as Amelia made an excellent impression. Gael Garcia Bernal is only seen briefly, but his role of Santiago, Amelia's nephew, has a pivotal importance in the film. Rinko Kikuchi, who appears as Chieko, makes a great contribution to the film.The cinematography of ""Babel"" is one of the best assets in the film. Rodrigo Prieto's vistas of Morocco, the desert, and modern Tokyo capture the essence of what the director is trying to say. Gustavo Santaolalla's music score mixes a lot of different styles blending perfectly with every aspect being shown. Alejandro Gonzalez Inurritu shows again why he is one of the best directors working in films at the present time.",Babel
18,dbborroughs,Well made but it doesn't add up to much,4,10 February 2007,"This is a film that is in part about how we fail to communicate and how we fail to understand not only with people in other cultures but also with people just around the block. This is the story of one family and how miscommunication and a lack of understanding spirals out into tragedy. Told in a disjointed manner that alters the time frame we have four stories: A family in Morocco who get a gun to protect the sheep they herd, A couple on vacation in the same country which has its vacation shattered by a shooting, the children of the couple who take a trip with their housekeeper to Mexico, and a seemingly unconnected story of a Japanese father and daughter. Thats what happens in simplistic terms. What happens on the screen is an often rending tale of how life connects us all in weird ways that we can't always explain. Its a beautiful movie to look at and is magnificently acted.Unfortunately this viewer was bored silly by it. Pretentious to the point of silliness this is a movie that is going to spell out its premise over and over again. Yes, we can't communicate (and if it isn't clear one of the characters is deaf), yes we are all connected, yes this will lead to tragedy. Thank you for pointing it out for us, but did you have to do it for almost two and a half hours? Don't get me wrong there is a good story in this movie, but the way the director has chosen to tell it, out of order with the grafting on of the Japanese portion of the film, it all becomes lost. Its an attempt to add some emotional and intellectual weight to a story that doesn't need it. I walked out of the the film admiring it and what it was trying to do, but not liking it much at all.Wait for video or cable",Babel
19,lastliberal,"This is your f*cked-up country, it's your responsibility!",10,30 July 2007,"Babel has won so many awards that it would take this entire review to list them. Let's just say that it is a powerful film about humanity and fate.Unlike the narrow provinciality of Crash, Babel stretches from North America (the United States and Mexico), to North Africa (Morocco), to Asia (Japan). It tells four interconnected stories and uses at least five languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese and sign). It also enjoys a very large, international, multiracial, multi-class cast.All of these people and stories are connected to a rifle. It is that rifle that sets everything in motion and dooms everyone to their fate. Like the other films of Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga - 21 Grams and Amores perros - the characters do not know why things are happening and they have no control over their circumstances. They are slaves to the ultimate fate - death.The rich come out ahead and the poor suffer. It is a story that has been told numerous times, but it never changes anything.",Babel
20,Boba_Fett1138,Alejandro González Iñárritu goes on the automatic pilot.,6,10 May 2007,"This is what happens when you receive nothing but praise as a director; you get sloppy and think you can get away with just everything. Having loved his previous movie I must say that Alejandro González Iñárritu really overdid it this time. The different plot lines don't feel connected and the events in the movie just not interesting enough, since they seem to be without a point. In the end the movie makes nothing more than a totally pointless impression. The movie has no message, so is there any reason to still watch this movie?Well, of course there is. There is nothing wrong with the actual directing style of Alejandro González Iñárritu in this movie but there is all the more wrong with the story. It's like they didn't even put enough effort in it and where thinking no matter what we are going to tell, this movie is going to be considered another brilliant one and will be in the race for many big awards, which it also was. It's like movie making completely on the automatic pilot.Just like we are used from a Alejandro González Iñárritu, the movie is told with many different plots in different settings with people in it that are all somehow connected. Problem with this movie really is that all of the plot lines are connected in a too simplistic and thin way. The movie just doesn't always feel as one whole, which is probably also due to the settings of the movie; America/Mexico, Morroco and Japan. 3/4 totally different settings over the world with 2/3 totally different characters, atmosphere and style.Quite frankly I don't understand why they picked Morocco as a setting for the movie. I think that this movie gives a wrong images of the country, as being a dangerous, terrorist filled country, where the police shoots without questions on children and beat up old persons, while in fact Morocco, compared to other African countries is far more advanced and also a far more stable country. Why didn't they picked any random middle-eastern country? It would had made the story far more believable and also more easy to buy for the viewers. And then there is the Japanese storyline. Well, well, well, what can I say...was it truly necessary? The way it's connected to the other story lines of the movie is incredibly thin and why does it have to focus on a sexual frustrated deaf Japanese teenager? Is it interesting? Is it engaging? Sorry, I really don't think so. The movie would had been probably been better off without it.The movie did well at the Oscars and was favorite for the big wins to many. Eventually it only won one Oscar for the best original score, by Gustavo Santaolalla, for his guitar plucking. It sort of makes me mad and shows that there is something wrong with the way the Academy votes for best original score, that over the past decade or so, mostly simplistic subtle scores have won the Oscar, instead of orchestrated musical scores. Bernard Hermann, Michael Kamen Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein, Basil Poledoouris all won one or none Oscar's in their life, Gustavo Santaolalla already has two...does this seem right and fair to you?Like we are used to from Alejandro González Iñárritu, the movie is filled with some big stars. However none of them is really ever given the opportunity to shine and makes you wonder if this movie wouldn't had been just as good/bad with different unknown actors in it. This was the role Brad Pitt skipped a part in ""The Departed"" for? It really wasn't his smartest career move and I just love the way how they tried to make him look like Benicio Del Toro in this movie. Sarcasm alert! The chemistry between him and Cate Blanchett was also a bit off. The only performance I really liked in the movie were from Gael García Bernal and Kôji Yakusho. It just isn't a movie that tries to shine with its actors, it's a movie that tries to shine with its story and storytelling and the realism of it all. In this case it didn't really worked out.The movie in the end feels like a pointless one, that with a couple of sequences, mainly with explicit sexual content in it, tries to provoke. I just couldn't care less about it all. Apparently the overall message of the movie was supposed to be that people in and from different countries don't communicate well enough. Well let me tell you, I'm a sort of a communication student and I certainly didn't picked up this message from this movie. So please try harder next time Mr. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga.Yes of course the movie is still better than the average one and of course there are more than enough elements present in this movie to make it worthwhile. I just hope that Alejandro González Iñárritu next project will be more original in its approach and will have a better and more connected script. I'm still a fan!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Babel
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A towering achievement,8,19 August 2021,"In Mexico, two people get married as a happy extended family watches on. In Japan, a deaf teenage girl struggles with her loneliness. In Morocco, a bus full of American tourists is slowly driving down the road, when, suddenly, a shot rings out. All of these stories are connected, and they will break your heart.A major theme here, as you might guess from the title, is communication. So many situations go wrong, or at least worsen, because of things that go unsaid, are poorly conveyed, etc. This is a movie with very few truly evil characters or intentions, but full of negative results. There are many times where things escalate, and it is almost always because of real people making choices. We in the audience can understand why they make the decisions, and sit back powerless to stop things from going wrong. The full immersion lets us appreciate the different cultures depicted, with no judgement. The decision to use subtitles instead of having dozens of characters who would not naturally do so, speak English, is inspired.This features graphic violence, some graphic nudity, sexual Content and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of drama. 8/10.",Babel

23,evanston_dad,An Exhausting Film,6,19 October 2006,"Alas, it appears that, based on other user comments here at IMDb, I am in the minority on this film. I found it to be tedious and exhausting, and the effort I put into sticking with it far outweighed any sense of closure I received from it.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu appeared at the screening I saw and introduced his film as the final entry in a trilogy that includes ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams."" Inarritu, in a comment that surprised me, said that his intent with this trilogy was not to focus on politics or social commentary, but rather to look at the modern family and what it means to be a father, son, mother, daughter, etc. This may have been his intention, but I don't feel that over the course of three entire films Inarritu did say much about these issues. Instead, he has painted a portrait of the world as he apparently sees it as a pretty bleak, uncaring and unforgiving place to live. I thought ""Amore Perros"" was so pessimistic as to border on nihilism; ""21 Grams"" came closer to finding a sense of peace and redemption among the general human crappiness. ""Babel"" sticks closer to the sentiments of the first film than the latter.""Babel"" is of course about communication, or more exactly miscommunication, in the modern world. It's a theme that has engaged the interest of many a filmmaker lately -- the idea that technology has made instant communication so much easier, yet people seem to be more than ever incapable of understanding one another. It's a conceit that greatly interests me, but Inarritu doesn't exploit its potential here. ""Babel"" consists of a monotonous series of scenes in which people shout, storm, fight and talk over one another, always in a hurry to be understood without taking the time to understand. Very well, point taken. But Inarritu makes this point within the film's first half hour -- you only need see one or two scenes of this kind of frustrating verbal gridlock to understand what he's trying to say; after that, the frustration just mounts without any kind of pay off. People are mean to one another, some are unbelievably callous (I didn't buy for a second that the group of tourists who accompany Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's characters to a remote Moroccan village after Blanchett is accidentally shot would be so uncaring as Inarritu depicts them). In Inarritu's world, all authority figures are to be justifiably feared, as they go around beating everybody up and pulling guns on innocent people. There's no nuance here; Inarritu pounds his message into you. For example, he obviously feels strongly about the mistreatment of illegal immigrants, especially those from Mexico, but instead of engaging in an intelligent debate about the topic, he sets up such an implausible, not to mention one-sided, scenario in this film that you can't help but agree with him.The biggest disappointment in ""Babel"" is his failure to fully utilize a couple of wonderful actors he has assembled. Cate Blanchett is utterly wasted as the caustic American wife whose shooting sets off the chain of events. And Gael Garcia Bernal likewise gets nothing to do as a hot-headed Mexican whose attempts to run from border patrol creates a sad ending for one of the major characters. Brad Pitt does better than expected with the frenzied, frustrated husband of Blanchett. But these people have no history. We know virtually nothing about anybody in the film, yet are expected to care deeply about what happens to them. Maybe that's part of Inarritu's point -- that we're all connected to one another even if we don't know it, and that the world has become so small that there are no longer such things as strangers in it. But this is a film narrative, not real life, and you can't build a compelling one out of anonymous characters.After ""21 Grams"" I thought I was warming up to Inarritu, but this film has sent me back to the detractors' camp. He certainly knows how to put a movie together, and he finds engaging ways to tell his stories. But his attitudes and approach to the modern world are so depressing and fatalistic that his films push me away rather than draw me in.Grade: C+",Babel
24,ferguson-6,To Be Alone,6,9 November 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Usually the only time a trailer is better than the actual movie is a comedy - where all the ""funny stuff"" is spoiled ahead of time. ""Babel"" had a terrific trailer that left us believing this would be an armrest clutching thriller. Instead we get a visually stunning lackluster attempt to recapture ""21 Grams"".Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""21 Grams"" and ""Amores perros"") directed ""Babel"" and co-wrote the script with Guillermo Arriaga. The multi-storyline with intertwining plots has been used very well recently in films like ""21 Grams"", ""Traffic"" and ""Crash"". Not sure exactly what is missing here, but we end up with multiple stories and characters that we care very little about. We do see loneliness and prejudice in all stories and many scenes are uncomfortable to watch, but each story is lacking something and the filmmakers seem to stoop to shock therapy whenever they are stuck.On one hand, it is worth seeing the film to see Brad Pitt not break out his smarmy smirk even once and the explosive Gael Garcia Bernal again leaps off the screen in his limited time, but for some reason Dakota Fanning's little sister Elle gets just about as much screen time as Mr. Garcia, although Adriana Barrage is fascinating as the nanny. Cate Blanchett is wasted as the American wounded while on a tour bus. The deaf-mute Japanese teenager who is in so much emotional turmoil is painful to watch, but we are never given a reason to connect with her. All of these issues are factors of lack of development in each of the stories. Close, but no cigar.Director Inarritu provides another visual masterpiece, but unlike his previous film gems, this time the guts are missing.",Babel
25,gradyharp,Global Coincidences Tied Brilliantly Together in a Stunning Film,10,30 October 2006,"Alejandro González Iñárritu and his creative partner Guillermo Arriaga are becoming two of the more significant artists in film of this century. They have worked together on 'Amores perros' then '21 Grams', gradually going from independent low budget, highly sophisticated controversial films to the point where those who produce films are willing to invest the big bucks that it takes to create a film like BABEL. The two men, writer/director and writer, seem to maintain an almost theatrical company around them: many of the same actors appear, the same crews, etc and the result is ensemble film-making whose final impact rests solely on the message of the film itself. Though this is one of the finest casts assembled yet this year, it would be difficult to select one or two as Oscar contenders, but it is certain the film and its director will gather awards wherever they are wisely and thoughtfully given.The story seems complex, spread as it is from Morocco, San Diego, Tokyo, and Mexico, but the unifying element is so simple that it makes the audience shudder. A rifle owned by a Tokyo based Japanese hunter is given to his Moroccan guide who in turn sells it to a poor Moroccan peasant whose two young sons guard and use for innocent practice until the younger son shoots at a tourist bus, injuring an American woman who is traveling with her husband, mending a strained marriage. The couple's children are at home in San Diego with their Mexican nanny who adores them and when no friends will help her is forced to take them with her to Mexico with her loony nephew to attend her son's wedding. All is well until the time to return home involves a foolish car chase through the Mexican American border and the nanny is arrested as an illegal immigrant despite her fifteen-year presence in California as the beloved housekeeper for the vacationing couple. Meanwhile, in Japan, the deaf mute young daughter of the man who began the problems with his gift of the rifle to the Moroccan, longs for attention from her father and escape from her misunderstood world of silence and goes to sad extremes to gain male affection, affection which involves the police who merely want to question her father about his rifle gift.Sound extraordinary? It is, and yet the manner in which Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga tell the story the string of bad luck coincidences focus on the problems of communication (from foreign language to sign language) deficits, misguided political obstructive processes, and the desperate need we all have for love and caring and understanding. The cast is enormous and uniformly outstanding: Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette are the parents, Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble their children, Adriana Barraza their nanny (a stunning actress this!), Gael García Bernal her irresponsible nephew, Michael Peña (so memorable in 'Crash') and Clifton Collins Jr. the border guards, Rinko Kikuchi the deaf mute young girl, and a group of Moroccan and Japanese actors that are too many to list.The cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto, the incredibly important film editors are Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, and the astonishing music score is the product of the gifted Gustavo Santaolalla. But it is the devotion of Alejandro González Iñárritu that leaves us with the punch-in-the-stomach ache that this superb film produces. This is a tough movie to watch, but one we should all see and see again. It is as fine as any film to be released this year. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",Babel
26,zetes,"Unsuccessful, but still good",8,21 January 2007,"If it weren't for the great performances in Iñárritu's previous film, 21 Grams, I think I would have called it one of the worst films of 2003. The script was ridiculous and, even worse, chopped up chronologically in a pointless and exceedingly artificial and pretentious way. So I have not been in a hurry to catch his new film, Babel, but finally grudgingly decided to go to a matinée because I assume that it will be a contender for the Oscars. And I'm glad I did. It's imperfect, but worthwhile. And it's a huge improvement over 21 Grams. As is the vogue, Babel contains three stories connected tenuously by narrative, but more closely related by theme. That theme is the difficulty of communication, and also the inception of bridges spanning that difficulty. In one story, an American tourist in Morocco is accidentally shot by a child playing with a rifle. The second story takes place in the near future with that woman's children, as their caretaker, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, is forced to take them with her to her son's wedding across the border. The third story is about a deaf-mute Japanese teenager who is growing apart from her father, and is love-starved. Honestly, I don't think Iñárritu or his screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga, hit a homerun with their themes. I really don't think the film ends up saying anything important. And the interlocking narratives don't end up commenting on each other very well. The Japanese story in particular feels like it's out of left field. What I do like about the film is just the stories themselves. All three stories, even though they don't connect very well, are involving and entertaining. And Iñárritu directs them very well. Using a lot of close-ups, he succeeds in putting us directly into the action, and I felt like I was experiencing what the characters were experiencing. It's thrilling to feel that culture shock when the affluent white children find themselves in the middle of Mexican wedding festivities. Or the thrill when the deaf Japanese girl enters a night club for the first time, and how frightening it is to have the strobe lights destroy your ability to contact other human beings. The film may fail on a number of levels, but it does succeed in being vivid, which is something many better films fail to do. So I quite liked it.",Babel
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Babel,6,20 January 2007,"If my memory serves me well, my knowledge of The Towel of Babel is from the Bible, where it was said that men at one time were speaking one common language, and aspired to build a tower so high that it would reach the Heavens. For some reason, God decided to pour cold water on the massive project, by dispersing everyone on Earth to far corners, and have us humans speak multiple languages, so that overnight, we couldn't understand one another, and therefore, the Tower project had to be abandoned.Babel just triumphed at this year's Golden Globes by walking away with the Best Drama award, which The Departed was touted to win, but I guess having a movie which is a remake win the award, is akin to saying ""Infernal Affairs, you guys can trounce our multi-million dollar epics anytime"". Babel follows a similar formula to other acclaimed movies such as Crash and Syriana, which take on a multiple angle, multiple story, with multiple intertwined characters all running along in the fragmented narrative, with the story arcs all linked to a common theme. With Crash and Syriana, the themes were clear and simple. With Babel however, it lived up to its issue of communications.In a bad way that is. Babel probably wanted to be bringing across the message of the importance of communication, and miscommunication, but it turned out to live the message of the latter instead. Perhaps it wanted to elevate itself more into a thinking man's movie, but really, it's much ado about nothing. For movies which relied on narrative gimmicks such as this, it belongs to the same category as my previous movie review for Haven. Entertaining wannabe, but not quite there yet.Written and directed by the same team who did 21 Grams (director Alenjandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga, which probably explains why thanks went out to Naomi Watts and Sean Penn), it's not all that bad, but you rue at its missed opportunities to really become something great. There are four arcs here - the first being a Moroccan farmer and his children, the second an American couple in a life-and-death crisis, the third a Mexican housekeeper and the children of her employers, and lastly, a look into a Japanese deaf mute's relationships with people around her, which probably is the one with the least relations with the others, but had the most potential in bringing out the theme.In all the stories, you see the attempts at communication, or lack thereof due to language, but you notice many a times, that language itself serves not as a barrier so long as the willingness to address another person is there. The American couple (possibly the big name stars in the movie - Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) with zero language barriers, yet faced with insurmountable difficulties in understanding each other, or in the deaf mute's case, the constant brushing away of parental concern, and of course, the inherent difficulty in not being able to speak or hear another person.In fact, in all these stories, it's more about the cry for help, in various sense. The Moroccan farmer sensing futility in the heavy handedness of the law, the American couple literally begging for help in a land in which they do not speak the language, and in their ill attitudes of blaming everyone else, of the Mexican housekeeper getting her charges stuck in a nightmare situation, contradicting her many years of faithful service, and of course, the Japanese arc, the deaf mute undergoing peer pressure in getting laid, and we question the reasons for her sexual promiscuity. And I couldn't help it but laugh at the various televised news reports in the movie, that the media is always quick to jump to conclusions, and in doing so, helps nobody at all.There are familiar actors in the movie, but don't go expecting any to pick up any awards anytime soon, as their roles do not offer them a chance to shine, especially not in a crowded ensemble like this with little room for much character development. Keen eyed viewers might recognized Gael Garcia Bernal from another movie now showing - The King, and Dakota Fanning fans will get a chance to see her sister Elle Fanning in action, albeit in a very small role, most of the time asleep. What could have set tongues wagging would be Rinko Kikuchi's role which required full frontal nudity and Sharon Stone-ish moments, but really, there's nothing much to it.My verdict is that Babel is overrated, belonging to that cross narrative wannabe style of storytelling, with actually a very simple story to tell, let down by delivery, traded off for style instead. Don't expect too much from it.",Babel
28,siderite,Crash in slow motion. Rather boring.,7,24 February 2007,"Me an my big mouth! When I reviewed Crash I said that it was statistically improbable that the people in the story would meet so often in the entire area of L.A. Somehow, that spurred the making of Babel, where the destinies of people as far as Morroco, Japan, Mexico and the U.S. are linked together to create a truly boring film.You know the genre: separate stories linked together by tiny coincidences or links between people, so that in the end it seems like (without being) a single plot. Of course, some are more interesting than others. Crash, for example, I thought deserved an Oscar, while Babel does not. Especially since they tried the same silly thing in 2005 with Crash, now they should have at least try to improve the whole ""I am smarter than thee"" concept and make a good movie. Even if most American movies recently are but boring remakes or incredibly idiotic, there is no reason to nominate a film for the Oscars just for having a plot.Bottom line, I has ready to mark this with a 6. I mean, this film has no outcome! You watch some really boring and just a bit above average stories, then they end! Geez!",Babel
29,JamesHitchcock,Difficulties in Communication,9,11 December 2009,"Despite the title, """"Babel"" is not a Biblical epic telling the story of the Tower of Babel. Rather, it is an example of the ""portmanteau film"", or multi-narrative drama telling several different stories in one film. This type of film was popular in the fifties and sixties, but there have been a number of more recent examples, including Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" and Paul Haggis' ""Crash"". ""Babel"" portrays three separate, but interlinked, stories, one taking place in Morocco, one in Mexico and the United States and the third in Japan.The Moroccan story tells of Susan Jones, an American tourist who is shot and wounded while on a coach trip through the desert. At first it is thought that the shooting is a terrorist act, but in fact the shot was fired by a young boy named Yussef, who was simply showing off in order to impress his elder brother. (Their father, a goatherd, had given them the rifle to shoot the jackals that had been preying on his goats).The Mexican/American story concerns Amelia, a Mexican nanny working for an American family in San Diego. Amelia is left in charge of the two children, Mike and Debbie, while their parents are on holiday. She plans to attend her son's wedding across the border in Mexico, but at the last minute the children's aunt, who was to have looked after the children while she was in Mexico, telephones to say that she cannot take care of them. Desperate not to miss the wedding, Amelia decides to take the children with her, even though she does not have their parents' consent to take them out of the country. The Japanese story concerns a rebellious teenage girl, Chieko, and her search for love and affection following her mother's suicide.As I said, the three stories are interlinked. It is not difficult to work out that Susan and her husband Richard will eventually turn out to be the parents of Mike and Debbie, but the connection between the Japanese story and the others is rather less obvious. (It eventually transpires that the rifle used in the shooting originally belonged to Chieko's father, who gave it as a present to his guide while on a hunting trip in Morocco). There is also a visual link between the Moroccan and Mexican segments; both are set in similar arid desert landscapes. (The Japanese story, set in the urban sprawl of Tokyo, is more visually distinctive).More important is the thematic link between the stories, symbolised by the title ""Babel"". As the title suggests, an underlying theme of the film is difficulties in communication, although this concept is given a wider meaning than simply ""difficulties in understanding foreign languages"".One character cut off by differences in language is Chieko, who is deaf and dumb, and therefore unable to communicate in spoken Japanese. She can use sign language with a small group of friends, but with everyone else she is reduced to writing notes. Because of her handicaps she feels isolated from the society of which she is a part. She was deeply affected by the death of her mother and finds it difficult to communicate with her withdrawn, distant father. She has been unable to find a boyfriend of her own age her desperation for love has caused her to act in a sluttish, promiscuous manner; in the course of the film she attempts to seduce two older men.A key scene comes when Amelia and her nephew Santiago attempt to cross the Mexican border back into the USA. The misunderstandings which occur between them and the American border guards are due less to differences in language (both Amelia and Santiago speak fluent English) than to differences in nationality, culture and outlook. The guards instinctively mistrust Mexicans, whom they suspect of being illegal immigrants, while Santiago instinctively mistrusts any American in a position of authority.Difficulties in communication of another nature arise in the Moroccan story. Richard and Susan are left stranded in a small town, remote from medical help, when their tour party cravenly abandon them, wrongly believing that the shooting was the work of terrorists. (The US Embassy has been quick to push the supposed ""terrorist"" angle, believing that this suits American interests). We also learn that the marriage of Richard and Susan has been placed under strain by the sudden death of their third child.The film was made with an ensemble cast, containing few internationally known actors. The two main exceptions, of course, are Brad Pitt as Richard and Cate Blanchett as Susan, who seem to have been brought in to give the movie more than art-house appeal. I have at times in the past been critical of Pitt, but here he is very good, as is Blanchett. nevertheless, I felt that their contributions were equalled, perhaps even surpassed, by those of some of the lesser-known cast members. In particular I would single out Adriana Barraza as the devoted Amelia, the young Boubker Ait El Caid (not a professional actor) as Yussef and Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko. Kikuchi does not speak a word in the film, relying entirely on gestures and sign language to convey her character's wild, troubled nature.. It is a performance comparable to that given by Marlee Matlin in ""Children of a Lesser God"", made all the more impressive by the fact that Kikuchi, unlike Matlin, is not herself deaf.This was the first film I had seen by Alejandro González Iñárritu, and I was very impressed. ""Babel"", involving three stories, four countries and several different languages, is a hugely ambitious work, and that ambition has paid off. All three stories succeed as powerful and moving human dramas; their juxtaposition, which in less skillful hands could have seemed like a cheap gimmick, here has the effect of intensifying the power of the storytelling. The film well deserved its ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"" nominations. 9/10",Babel
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,How do you judge a film like this?,8,24 February 2007,"I really was not at all interested in seeing Babel, but when I heard it was nominated for best picture I have to admit that I was a little curious, it's the first time I've seen four out of the five movies nominated, so why not? While it was better than expected, I'm still not sure how to put that sentence. It's seriously one of those movies that is very interesting yet really has no point. I know there are some people on here that say they understood what the movie was and what it was about, but I honestly can't see how, because the movie connects together, yet has no moral or lesson.Basically it has four stories, one of two Americans in Morroco, the wife is accidentally shot and is on the struggle for her life. She was shot by a little boy who's father bought him and his brother a rifle to shoot animals for food. Then the parent's children have been rushed over the border by their nanny who is a Mexican illegal immigrant. Then the man who gave the rifle to the man who sold it to the father is in Japan and his daughter who is a deaf mute is finding it hard to fit into her world and is very sexually frustrated.Babel is truly an interesting movie, I don't know if it's for all, it takes a little patience, at least I was able to get through it and was interested on how it was going to end, it was like a TV show and you just had to know what the next part was going to be like. I'm not sure if it will win best picture, but good luck to the crew, but it seems like so far, it's just another ""Crash"".8/10",Babel
31,DKosty123,Large Cast- 4 Countries,6,25 May 2007,"It is interesting this film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture in the drama category. While 2006 was not an even good year for films in general, that awards means that even in places other than the USA it was not a banner year either.This film does create a feeling of being in each of the countries. It does this by utilizing location shooting of families in all of them which only makes sense as the films script tries to tie 4 countries together into 1 plot. The film labors to do it & gets it done, but it takes a long time doing it.The logistics of producing the film must have been a nightmare, 4 large production crews. Most of the film makes sense, except there is one sequence with a glaring error. The error is some characters talking about the American Woman being shot in Morroco before it actually happens in the film. Oops, this is a major continuity error.A lot of the film is subtitled. Parts of the film definitely create the R rating. Overall the film tells a good story & slowly ties it together. The key is slowly as this movie could lose a race with the tortoise. I would not recommend this one to a general audience as it is aimed at the film as an art.This films success is in its settings & photography in 4 countries. The portrait is painted in all 4 & you get to see the paint dry in all of them before the film is over.",Babel
32,sddavis63,An Interesting Way To Portray Various Cultures,7,5 June 2010,"In general, I'm not a huge fan of the whole ""unconnected stories that finally intersect"" theme. I will grant, though, that ""Babel"" was one of the better stories of that type that I've seen. It's an interesting study of culture in a variety of ways. First is that we get to see snippets of a variety of cultures - from family life and medical conditions in Morocco, to the ""teen scene"" in Japan, to a Mexican wedding. That was all very interesting. Culture, of course, requires some form of communication, and that's also part of the story involved with this movie. In each of the four inter-connected story lines there are issues with communication - from Americans trying to navigate their way through a crisis in Morocco, to the deaf Japanese girl who has to struggle to be understood by the ""hearing"" world, to the Mexican nanny trying to communicate her struggle to find lost children with the US Border Agents. All that was also very interesting.The movie begins with a rifle being sold from one Moroccan family to another - a rifle that's then used to accidentally shoot an American tourist, whose children are back home being cared for by the Mexican nanny. The ways in which the various stories intersect isn't always clear - especially difficult to fit into the overall picture was the Japanese storyline, and even once that connection was revealed, that story seemed superfluous. I wasn't really sure why it was included in the movie. The ""connecting point"" between it and the rest of the stories didn't seem necessary.The timeline in this is a bit unusual. It's not linear, so not everything in every story is being told in chronological order. In fact, the story seems to move in more of a circular pattern, with the end seeming to take us back to the beginning. In some ways that created confusion, although it also probably served to keep the viewer guessing. Overall, this was a pretty decent movie.",Babel
33,Buddy-51,drama with a kick,8,24 January 2007,"In the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel, the human race, filled with the sins of arrogance and pride, builds an immense structure that will allow it to reach the heavens, and, in so doing, achieve equality with God. Enraged by such presumption, a jealous Jehovah punishes the people by scattering them to the four corners of the earth and confusing their language. It is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's contention, in his latest film, ""Babel,"" that we are still paying the price for that event all these thousands of years later. For the point of this film is that, even in this technologically advanced age of instant, global communications, we are basically all still separated from one another by the barriers of race, religion, culture and, most especially, language. Indeed, it is this last factor that seems to cause the most problems, for it results in serious miscommunication and misunderstandings, which in turn lead to immense personal suffering and human tragedy on both an individual and global scale.As he did in his previous films, ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams,"" Inarritu, working with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, has fashioned a multi-narrative work that pays little heed to the spatial and temporal rules of conventional storytelling, going back and forth in time and space, as it spins a tale set in three widely separated and distinctly different corners of the world. The movie begins with the delivery of a rifle to a poor Islamic goat herder who is barely eking out an existence on a barren, windswept hillside in Morocco. When one of the man's young sons uses the gun to shoot into a nearby bus filled with American tourists, the boy sets into motion a series of events that threatens to have immense personal and political repercussions for the individuals and nations involved. The bullet strikes a woman (Cate Blanchett) who is touring the country with her husband (Brad Pitt). Seriously wounded, she is taken to a nearby village where Pitt works frantically to get medical attention for her while an international crisis threatens to erupt over the incident.The second story involves the couple's young children back home in California, who are taken on an unauthorized trip to Mexico by their illegal-immigrant nanny desperate to attend her son's wedding. The third tale, set in Tokyo, seems, at first, entirely unrelated to the others until the tenuous connection tying them altogether is finally established near the end of the film. This one involves a deaf teenaged girl, embittered by both her handicap and the recent suicide of her mother, who begins to act out in ways that reveal her intense loneliness and willingness to do just about anything to fit in.The makers of ""Babel"" really challenge their audience by not going for obvious connections and by allowing the film to feel formless and disconnected for fairly long stretches of time. I admit that I kept flashing in and out of the film for about the first two-thirds of its running time - at times feeling it was a work of genius, at others, feeling that it was not working at all - but, eventually, the movie won me over entirely as the meanings came more into focus and as each story moved inexorably towards its emotionally wrenching conclusion. Much of the credit in this regard goes to the powerful musical score by Gustavo Santaollala, which starts off slowly then builds in intensity as the movie draws to a close (Santaollala actually repeats verbatim one of the haunting riffs he used in ""Brokeback Mountain"").In each of these three stories, problems arise as a result of either an inability to communicate clearly or a stubborn refusal to say what needs to be said at a given crucial moment. But the real power of the film lies not in its message but in the intensity of the individual moments it shows us, be it Blanchett's pain as she undergoes treatment for her wound; Pitt's desperation in getting his wife to a place of comfort and safety and his emotional breakdown while speaking on the phone to his young son; a wild ride through the desert Southwest as a young man madly attempts to outrun some border patrol officers in hot pursuit; a young girl's humiliating attempt to seduce a compassionate but clear-thinking older man; a poor father's moment of despair as he comes to realize how his son's actions have brought shame on the family. The film is replete with many such moments.Inarritu has drawn riveting performances out of his large cast, primarily from Pitt, Blanchett, Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi. Even though they aren't given the quantity of screen time they would have received in a conventional single-story film, these performers all make the most of the scenes they are in.It would be easy to dismiss ""Babel"" for being contrived, pretentious and self-important, for pretending to be more insightful and profound about the state of the world than, perhaps, it really is. As such it would be an easy target. Yet, ""Babel,"" for all its seeming ""significance,"" is surprisingly restrained in driving its message home, unlike, say ""Crash"" which literally screams out its meaning with every contrived incident and line of dialogue. ""Babel"" requires its viewers to think - indeed it ASKS them to think - in ways ""Crash"" never comes even close to doing. Like many challenging artists, Inarritu and Arriaga may be too full of themselves for some people's tastes, but at least they don't talk down to their audience.""Babel"" captures the paradox inherent in a world in which we are brought together by circumstances and our commonality as a species, yet driven apart by our differences.",Babel
34,Robert_duder,"Incredibly bizarre, and yet captivating but....so bizarre?? I don't know what to give it",7,25 February 2007,"As I sit here writing this I am honestly not sure if I am going to be able to give Babel an actual rating out of ten. I mean I sat in the theater which was half full and from the moment the movie opened there was dead utter silence...no coughing, no laughing, no popcorn spilling or giggles from the back row...just silence. And if they were like me they were watching in absolute awe with their mouths gaping open unable to NOT watch Babel. Shouldn't that make it the best film in the world?? Not necessarily. In some ways it was like a horrible yet brilliant spectacle...like a train wreck or a nuclear explosion. Babel was complex, confusing, filled with what I think was some enormous plot holes, non-sensical moments and despite what people say is a tie-in between the three main stories it was minimal at best. It seemed more like watching three movies simultaneously that had so little to do with each other. Fortunately some of those stories even without the tie in were very well presented and intriguing. It's a film about human emotion across the world and it works for that but if the film tries to be about the gun that changes all these people's lives...well it doesn't really work.Brad Pitt supposedly leads this cast as he gained a lot of critical acclaim for his role as husband Richard who takes his wife on an adventure to try and piece their marriage back together following the death of their baby...I think...Pitt is good, I like Brad Pitt, he's a great actor but he's not the lead. His story is probably the smallest of the three intersecting story lines despite being the 'main' storyline if that makes any sense. Pitt's intensity and concern and panic is all very good just not the best in the film. Cate Blanchett plays his wife Susan and she too does an okay job but her performance is even less exuberant as Pitt's. She spends the majority of the film shot and therefore slipping in and out of consciousness and despite a few moments of intensity she is not the bright star of the film. Adriana Barraza plays the couple's nanny in the United States who is forced to take the kids to Mexico for her son's wedding when the parents aren't able to return. Barraza is also good, captivating, watchable, serious and emotional and you feel a lot of empathy for her throughout. Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble both do a great job as the young children. I think one of the standout performances in the film if not for any other reason than it's bizarre nature is that of Oscar Nominee Rinko Kikuchi who plays deaf-mute Chieko who is reeling from the death of her mother and longs to just be normal and accepted. Sexually disturbed, depressed, ignored...her performance is by far the most moving and most watchable. She does her absolutely chaotic role with ease and makes it believable. The other storyline is also very well performed and intriguing with Boubker Ait El Caid, Said Tarchani, Mustapha Rachidi, Abdelkader Bara and the others I don't have space to mention...they all do great.Each character and actor has such a specific purpose to the story and they all do so well and if there had been a lesser cast I might have walked out of this film. Let's talk plot holes...first and foremost if you watch the two young fellows who are charged with shooting Jackals using 'the gun', they shoot on the bus straight on and yet Blanchett's character Susan is shot through the right window which would be a right angle from where they are shooting. That bothered me. Some aspects of the story are interwoven with the smallest of connection and truly don't really mesh together no matter how interesting they are on their own. The time-line being altered is mostly confusing rather than clever because it seems to me that for the time they sat in the desert waiting for medical attention they could have driven back to the hospital and got help. But when all is said and done the brilliance comes from the acting and the decent parts of the story and the absolutely beautiful setting from the Morrocoan desert to the beautiful city of Tokyo to Mexico...each one has their own distinct style and it feels like traveling from place to place. Babel is indeed worth seeing because I think there is some brilliance there but it's underlying and the average movie goer might really be put off by it. I'm going to give it a mark which might come across as on the low side but perhaps I'm not seeing the real brilliance that should or could make it a perfect film. 7/10",Babel
35,ElMaruecan82,"""Real frontiers are within us, and they're the most dangerous ones""",10,16 May 2017,"... said Alejandro Inarritu while contemplating the wall between America and Mexico and the human flows circulating from one side to other, legally or not yet all the borders in the world wouldn't amount to a hill of beans if people decided to sit and talk, to take time to understand each other. To quote another director, it was Jean Renoir who thought-provokingly said during a friendly chat with actor Michel Simon that laziness was underrated, because civilized people, rather than acting, preferred talking and make the world a better place, with words as a first step.And this is how ""Babel"", as magnificent a title as it is, is misleading; the Biblical episode symbolized the human hubris and its divine punishment: dividing people by languages. However, those who populate the film are ready to overcome these barriers, out of fraternal impulses, curiosity and sometimes, necessity. This hymn for universality is even more powerful because it doesn't ignore the specificity of the ground it walks on, whether Moroccan mountains, the urbane belly of a Japanese metropolis or a small Mexican town across the desert, Inarritu explores each identity, each form of expression, not to say that we're all the same, but so we gather the certitude of our own differences before concluding that we're still the same after all.There comes a point in ""Babel"" where we stop seeing the children of a goat shepherd, or the deaf daughter of a Japanese businessman (Rinko Kikuchi) or two big stars playing American tourists (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) or a Mexican nanny (Adriana Barraza) taking her employers' children to her son's wedding. Indeed, we stop labeling them from their origins, we only see two brothers victim of childish temptations, the tragedy of three fathers, deafness as a convenient alibi while there's more to make communication difficult. We see a woman who worked hard all her life and decided to please herself just for once and compromising everything she built, and we see a couple trying to find to overcome a marital crisis before Karma intervenes through an accidental bullet.Yes, there's a moment where we embrace the poetry of Inarritu, the realization that the air we breathe is the same, the way we break down after seeing a loved one bleeding to death, the way our pain can be either silent or tearful, the way we gaze at the sky with the same amazement, the way we're all humans there's a moment where the Mexican woman, after wandering for hours in the middle of the desert, sees a car and starts running, hysterically shouting, she doesn't scream in Mexican, she's just letting her heart vent the last gasps of desperate energy. The film is full of countless moments where to identify the existence of a universal language: we all nod and shake our head the same, and sometimes, a foreigner is closer than a compatriot. Actually, many tragedies in the film occur because of secrets, silences and misunderstandings within the same culture.Another marvel of Hyperlink Cinema, ""Babel"" doesn't rely on a complex non-linear storytelling where you only get everything at the end, the stories are simple and could have made powerful dramas in their own right, but they all converge toward the same recognition of universality. It's a powerful journey into our own humanity, a movie one should watch before stating that there are some countries deserving to be invaded. The day, there'll be ""Babel"" about North Korea or Iran, maybe people will start to act reasonably. Because like for human relationships, sometimes, more than love, more than respect, understanding is the key element, understanding someone is like learning empathy. You can't bomb a country if you're empathetic, you can't make a terrorist attack either. I called the film universal, it's more than that: it's humanist and it's essential.And after watching it, I wanted to know more about the project, convinced that the finished result was as fascinating as the journey that made it. And yes, the making-of provided many additional elements to understand the complexity of human language, that could have made a great sequel to the film. There were three moments that stood out and they were set in my country, I loved that Inarritu was surprised to learn that one of the Moroccan extra (playing the old lady) didn't understand one word in Arabic, and they needed a Berber interpret, putting the Palestinian interpret in a tricky situation. Later, during a shootout, I saw the female interpret being upset and I knew it was reminding her of some memories. I didn't need explanation, her eyes said it all. Finally, during a rain, Moroccan crew men were singing under an umbrella and one of the assistants asked them if it was a song to stop the rain, they nodded and kept laughing. It was just a pop song from the 70's, well sometimes; we're entitled to our little private jokes.Because languages aren't only here to separate us, they reinforce us within a group and allow us to be best prepared to talk to the others, there's no ""other"" without a strong identity, and the efforts to overcome the languages also allow you to better understand the people, it's all about universal understanding but not at the expense of human diversity. Inarritu must have had troubles with Moroccan language but when he embraced the two kids at the end of the shooting, he didn't need any word to understand their grief, and didn't find any to console them. Understanding, emotion and pain. that image, both sad and beautiful, spoke a thousand words.Inarritu made a timeless and universal movie, establishing Cinema as an art-form that transcended the barriers of languages and culture. Maybe more than ever, we need movies like ""Babel"". If the Academy wasn't busy giving a sympathy Oscar for Scorsese, they would have acknowledged the cinematic importance of ""Babel"" and its incomparable beauty.",Babel
36,paul2001sw-1,World wide pain,8,18 August 2009,"A shot is fired in Africa; the reverberations echo around the world. That's the premise for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's movie 'Babel', and it's undoubtedly a skillful piece of film-making, with its note-perfect depictions of Morocco, Mexico and Japan and its gradual weaving of a world-wide web of pain. The acting is all good, although Cate Blanchett stands out for he subtle performance of a woman on the verge of death. I couldn't help but wonder, however, whether or not its interlinked stories would each have been strong enough to carry a shorter film on their own; and that by mixing them up, the film-maker isn't actually hiding the brevity of their individual narrative arcs. Certainly, there's no final trick linking everything together, the situation in each story gets slightly better than at one point it threatens to be, and then the film ends. It's still an absorbing movie; but possibly, just slightly underwritten.",Babel
37,dromasca,a very American movie from a Mexican director,7,4 March 2007,"I expected more from the director of '21 grams'. 'Babel' belongs to the same family of movies as last year's 'Crash', trying to build a world and demonstrate a message by interleaving several story lines rather than using one principal story. It is interesting in structure, but it also demonstrates that any formula has its limits if it is not backed-up by artistic courage.'Babel' tries to be too moralistic, starting with the title. It is a story of lack of communication, in the three or four different plots the barrier of language plays a central role, but the treatment is too rough and the idea was much more cleverly inserted in'Borat', not to speak that it was more fun.'Babel' is also a story about our world being a global village, where each individual actions can influence remote people's destinies. However, when analyzed in part each of the stories is too conventional on its own. it is their juxtaposition that gives them a sense.Yet, Alejandro González Iñárritu is a good director, and he does provide at least something that I liked - it is the adaptation of the style of directing of each segment to the cinema style of the respective region. The Moroccan track looks like an Arabic drama, the Mexican scenes have a flavor that is but too familiar to Iñárritu, while the Japanese story is told in a style and filmed in colors that remind the Japanese thrillers. Nice idea.The cast does a fair job, although one may wonder if Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's skills were really needed here. The answer is no but than the two probably are here just to bring viewers to the screening theaters. 'Babel' is more interesting than many of the films of the season, but his losing to 'The Departed' in the Oscar's race was well deserved.",Babel
38,ThomasDrufke,So Depressing,7,2 November 2014,"Alejandro González Iñárritu has never failed to impress me on the storytelling side of things. With 21 Grams and now Babel he has proved to be incredible at interweaving different stories into one giant tale. There is a great ensemble cast in Babel that moves the story along without ever really missing the beat. The problem is that this film is just so depressing. It's not really a film I would ever want to watch again, even with how well it's put together.Without really giving anything away, it's about 4 interlocking tragic stories that were all started because of one choice to give one gun away to one man. That's what I found most fascinating about Babel is that life can be impacted so many ways by the simplest of things. It's scary thinking about what events you may have caused or impacted that you will never know about. Of course, you cant live life that way. But nonetheless I appreciate Iñárritu giving us that perspective on life even if it's a bit dramatized.I really thought everyone gave a great performance, but particularly Adriana Barraza and Brad Pitt. When I watch a film I like to believe that characters are actually caring for other characters. It's seems like a simple task on the outside but when actors engross themselves in a role to where I believe they are actually family you know it's something special.

39,MLDinTN,140 minutes of boredom,2,9 March 2008,"There's not much good to say about Babel. It is highly over rated by critics. The movie follows three separate stories that are not really that interesting. One involves an American couple on a tour bus in Morrocco. A couple of kids are playing with a rifle and shoot at the bus and hit Susan. Her husband, Richard, gets the bus to take them to a small village where they try to stop the bleeding and get a medical evacuation by some means. Real exciting hey. Next story involves the couple's kids back home. The babysitter takes them to Mexico to go to her son's wedding. Her drunk nephew driving them home gets in trouble with the border police and it involves a chase. He leaves them out in the desert. The third story is the worst one of all. It is so boring and pointless. A deaf Japanese girl has problems with her father and mother's suicide. She starts acting up by flashing people and acting inappropriate around men for attention. Sounds real exciting, huh.FINAL VERDICT: I'm glad I didn't pay to this. I don't get how this could get a best picture nomination. I don't recommend it.",Babel

This movie would have deserved a ten if it wasn't for the stupid Japanese girl scenes. Who wants to see a sex-happy, deaf/mute girl. I don't anyhow. The other three stories were gripping and emotional.This tells the story of how a American tourist gets shot by a Moroccan person living out the middle of nowhere and how if affected the lives of four different cultures.The acting is pretty darn good here. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett have great chemistry together also shown in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I really felt bad for the caretaker. She had a good heart but some things she did were stupid.The music here is powerful.

""Babel"" consists of four seemingly unrelated stories, which take place on opposite sides of the world, but eventually merge into one. This is a drama about the fragility of human fate. About how seemingly harmless moves can cause tragic consequences, how a moment of stupidity, recklessness, carelessness, one wrong step, can plunge the culprit into ruin and destroy many more innocent lives along the way. The film brings a wide range of characters who, like the story itself, are rarely realistic, perfectly believable and lifelike. The tempo is a bit slower, but that is not a flaw here, because it contributes to a realistic atmosphere and leaves us room to truly experience the powerful emotions of the characters. I also have to mention the hand-held camera, excellent directing and editing, and the beautiful music for which it won an Oscar. A warm recommendation.8/10",Babel
42,tabuno,Confusing and Inconsistent,5,22 January 2019,"2 January 2007. Warning: Spoilers. One too many plot lines leads to underdevelopment of essential characters in this Crash-like drama that attempts to say something about misunderstanding but can't contain its overly ambition intent. The loudest confusion of Babel is not the cultural clashes, language clashes as may have been intended but the utter confusion of timelines, mysterious narratives that mislead, and an unnecessary sexual overtone. The best performance surprisingly is the Spanish caretaker who does a great job. The weakest and most unsatisfying link in the Japanese connection. The twists in this movie a broadcast long before they happen and they are usually predictable and weak, particularly the long distance telephone call. There are hints of Lost in Translation and even the Blair Witch Project, but each had a much more singular focus allowing for intimate connection with the characters. There are too many questions even in the beginning that are sometimes never answered or are seemingly conveniently brought up towards the end of the movie. The potential of each of the three major plots were seriously compromised by using three not just two plots. The possibility of the capturing the real essence of Babel was never achieved. The cinematography was great. The sound was great. But even the soundtrack at the end, with the non-Japanese music was very discordant.

45,Dr_Coulardeau,The war on terror blocks the globalized planet,10,23 November 2006,"Such a film could be considered as a manifesto about the state of the globalized world right in the middle of the war on terror. A manifesto against that war on terror because it does not consider human needs and particularly the desires, the wants and the wishes, not to speak of the impulses and other drives, hungers and passions, of the young, all ages considered, from 5 to 35. The film shows how the war on terror creates unsolvable situations in which human beings are literally tumbled and spinned actually and really to death. It transforms divisions and divides into uncrossable barriers and frontiers and borders.The film shows how the US-Mexico border is turned into a trap for simple people, including children who are absolutely innocent of any crime and are made guilty of fantasmagoric and incredibly inhuman menaces revealing that the real menace to humanity is not on the side of the illegal immigrant but on the side of the neurotic and psychotic US government, citizens, police, and other uniformed personnel.Then the film shifts to Morocco where a bus load of tourists get trapped in the mountain because two vain boys are trying to show off to each other how they can shoot a gun better than the other. It wounds an American woman and the war on terror transforms an insignificant local event into a global menace blocking the necessary helicopter in Casablanca for at least two days. What could and would have been done in twelve hours before, now takes at least forty eight hours and involves the State Secretary instead of keeping the problem at the proper level of a consul. The life of the woman is thus endangered and jeopardized by and for the political ambitions of some Washington-DC paranoid politicians. Then we move to Japan and there some deaf and mute girls nearly create a situation by trying to satisfy their sexual drives at any cost in a society where boys their age are considering them as monsters, at first, and then as nothing but live pleasure dollies. That leads to the last level of denunciation. Kids are made paranoid in our developed countries and plain irresponsible in third world countries : the latter shoot at a bus for fun because they have been accustomed and conditioned into accepting it as normal though it goes against the very grain of their culture. The association of this act to incestuous voyeurism and sexual onanism shows that it is the context we create that makes kids become what we call terrorists, though they are only kids space-out by the cultural shock that brings the two sides of a divide into clashing to the finish. And the whole film is pervaded, from title to end, with the impossibility to communicate : many languages are colliding here and there, now and then, but also all our media are exploding our codes of values, be they traditional or educational. When globalization is based on fear, paranoia and an overpowered fantasmagoric survival instinct, we can only produce a total breakdown. We have to think everything over and mend what may still be mendable or look for solutions for what cannot be mended any more. Good morning Vietnam !

46,johnnyboyz,"With near effortless guile, Iñárritu covers a handful of characters over as many continents, each undergoing a separate crisis in wonderfully taut, dramatic style.",7,1 July 2010,"I suppose the bulk of Babel revolves around what most would purvey or dismiss as either clichés or stereotypes; people representative of daft ideological roles born out of other films of other genres and the contemporary world we live in. If you were told of a film that revolved around: an American couple struggling in a foreign territory that ever so eerily resembled The Middle East; a token Mexican nanny that serves an American family, of whom is relatively incompetent and inconsiderate and of whom also speaks little English; a father who ""wants what's best for his daughter"" as well as an adolescent girl with only one thing on her mind in the way of other adolescent boys and whose antics wouldn't go amiss in one of those tacky American teen-comedies, you'd be forgiven for not immediately jumping to it. While Babel revolves around each of these sorts of people at various stages, allowing more time for some than others, the film breathes life into what are essentially clichés; allowing them to think, breath, react and feel pain as well as experience items that grossly affect them usually born out of their own decision making. Rather than propel them through a narrative that requires each dumbo piece of iconographic caricature to submit to audience expectation, for either crass laughs (the Mexican nanny and the would-be sexually active girl) or pseudo dramatics (the Americans struggling in an overseas territory), Babel drags them through a series of quite gruelling scenarios that affect them physically and psychologically. The film is an intriguing look at the inexplicable ties of fate; a delving into the often unexplainable, often dangerous acts and mindsets of individuals whose actions can endanger and hurt them as well as those around them. Babel is a much heralded 2006 piece from Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu, something that takes the notion of the cause and effect 'rule' and spins it to a very specific tune. It revolves around a handful of people of various nationalities going through a number of emotions and crisis', the film beginning with a grim looking man carrying a rifle over his shoulder amidst a dry and desolate looking land in profile shot form, immediately establishing some sense of hostility or conflict. But with whom? In refraining from beginning with a more traditional establishing shot of sorts, Iñárritu allows us little room to breath and immediately plunges us up close with the action; as the film plays out, we discover the film is about people ill at odds, or in conflict, with each another; themselves and those around them they cannot even see nor often even knew existed. Two separate stories feed off of a premise revolving around youngsters and the rather powerful items they're granted access toward, with the misuse of both of these items brining about negative emotions and experiences. For deaf Japanese school girl, and griever of her mother's suicide, Chieko (Kikuchi) it's her femininity and budding sexuality she abuses, something that takes her down a dark path when the manifesting with a bad crowd becomes prominent. For goat farm dwelling young Morrocan brothers Yussef and Ahmed, the falling of a wholly unnatural item in a powerful bolt action rifle into their hands sparks problems of its own.But what links the stories is the mistreating of these powerful items by people without minds developed enough to know of the consequences of their actions. Additionally, the firing of the rifle into a bus from a hill top and the persistent games of seduction on the male of the human species are actions born out of what gamesmanship with accomplices watching on exists. Chieko pushes the boundaries of her own sexuality on boys sitting across food halls as her friends look on in disbelief, giggling thus encouraging a maintaining of said actions; when one of Ahmed and Yussef fire into the coach after previously having toyed with the gun in firing off practice shots, it's to test the sheer metal of the item, much like Chieko's sexuality, so as to observe just how far one can go before some kind of reaction is born out the action. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play an American couple named Richard and Susan, their first instance of being on screen seeing them sit opposite one another as degrees of disagreement become apparent in their current mental state: she's apprehensive, he's rueful. Whilst on a coach for tourists later on, the aforementioned Moroccan boys will fire off into their coach hitting Susan, in turn sparking a somewhat global panic linked to the source of the rifle and what's perceived as a terrorist attack. American characters in the film are mostly victimised and in a film all about travel of the mind; body and soul, Susan and Richard are given the roles of bedding down in a town as potential hostiles watch on and barely anything is done. Their children are Debbie and Mike, two further examples of children being put in perilous and vulnerable predicaments born out of adult or a superior's negligence. The film links them to Ahmed and Yussef in this sense but to their parents in that they are a pair of Americans caught in a volatile situation in a foreign land, something born out of Mexican nanny Amelia's (Barraza) wish to cross the border so as to attend her son's wedding and the inability to find a carer for them. Like their parents, Debbie and Mike are victimised as they observe a gritty and rather unwelcoming world well outside of their 'bubbled' San Diego existence, later relegated to bedding down in a desert-like terrain having been the victims of a serious run in with the elements around them that was out of their control. Great credit is due to Iñárritu for being able to shift tones and such as he jumps from the hostile, dusty African terrains to the metropolis that is the Japanese city of Tokyo amidst many other things.",Babel
47,leplatypus,Babble! (Screen),1,18 November 2006,"This is a composite movie, i.e. several stories are mixed. But the lack of dynamism & imagination makes its viewing rather dull.First, if the background is our actual world (Morocco, Japan & Mexico), the director seems to propose no vision, no interpretation: Difficult lives are universal? Technology isn't the panacea? Human needs tribes? Then, the links between the capsules aren't natural but appear like God ex-machina: an American couple, whom children are cared by a Mexican nanny, goes in vacation in the exact place in Morocco where the father of a deaf Japanese teenager used to go. Ouff....In my opinion, the Japanese drama would have been better edited mute. The Mexican part doesn't bring anything (a big fiesta) & the come-back is so filled with incoherence, you can't believe what happens... The morocco trip is terribly long because nobody seems to care, except the husband & the native guide.Well, a film about bad decisions & there is not less & not more....",Babel
48,insomniac_rod,Multi-racial cultures mixed through the eyes of Hollywood trying to deliver a message...,8,27 September 2009,"""Babel"" is a very good film that displays how people around the world have a connection and that languages, culture, and more characteristics should not be a barrier for anything.Iñarritu demonstrated his excellent directing skills in ""Amores Perros"" and the haunting ""21 Grams"" and tried to repeat the formula in this big-budget Hollywood experience.The result? Not a memorable film except for the acting and social message it delivers.Adriana Barraza stole the show with his tender and brave performance. She demonstrated the horrors of Mexican immigrants who try to cross the frontier with the USA. Her performance is heart breaking and memorable, haunting. Brad Pitt demonstrates he's a very talented and versatile actor. Cate Blanchett is amongst the most important actresses of her generation. Plus she's good looking.The main stories displayed in the movie are interesting and deliver expectations.I can't say much about this movie because it's one of those experiences that work better when different opinions are told about it.Sadly, in my opinion, I think that it was too clichéd and mainstream for my likes.Some situations are heart breaking and some are 100% Hollywood. The score is memorable, haunting.",Babel
49,imseeg,The fragility of love for family shown in its utmost helplesness and beauty... Awe inspiring story about love in times of need.,9,31 May 2019,"Judging by some Imdb reviews this movie is NOT suited for the masses and NOT suited for regular Brad PItt action fans. However magnificent and delicate Babel is, it is too slowburning, depressing and delicate in nature for the masses to be liked I guess...Having gotten that message out of the way I want to praise this movie skyhigh for all the arthouse movie lovers out there, because it is an incredible delicate and beautiful portrait about the fragility of love for family bonds between parents and their young children in 3 different continents; Africa, Asia and America.Babel intertwines 3 stories about 3 different families with young children, who each struggle for survival, although there is a devious connection which interlinks their destiny. Are the family bonds strong enough to survive the hardships they have to endure? That's the heartwrenching question this movie poses indirectly...one of the questions...Director Inarritu is a poet. Truly a visual poet. Watching the way in which this story slowly enfolds is making me silent in awe of the beauty with which this director portrays the hardships people can face. Despite these struggles parents and their young children are still able to come together in strength and bear the burden of their losses. I truly dont know any other director who has got such magnificent visual power as Inarritu. He is a master in portraying the deepest emotions people go through when they are deeply in need, with often only using stunning visuals and music, without any spoken words.Advice for the impatient; dont watch it all, or please give it some time, because this slowburning movie only truly starts to lift of in spirit after an hour, with an emotional climax at the end that still gives me goosebumps thinking about it...Remember his name: director Inarritu. Please check out some (or all) of his other oscar awarded masterpieces ""Biutiful"" and ""Birdman"", which have similar awe inspiring tales of families struggling in times of need...",Babel
50,jzappa,How Profound the Negative Effects of Guns Can Be,10,26 November 2006,"Babel is a film about communication, lack thereof, and a chain reaction example of how. It's a film, especially right now in time in terms of both politics and everyday people, that says something very important. It has several characters but very few sustained scenes where they can be developed beyond what we see, yet we still care even if we are not supposed to entirely understand. Pitt, Blanchett, and Bernal, the names and faces of the film, rarely get scenes beyond five or ten minutes, yet they flesh out just enough. We feel Pitt's heart thumping on the phone near the end, we believe Blanchett during the scene wherein she is shot, the scene that begins the crescendoing of the epic labyrinthine plot, which unfolds in that ambitious, though-absorbing way where if you don't pay close attention, you will lose or misplace something in the shuffling-card-deck order of the story, a tradition for any film directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and written by Guillermo Arriaga.Communication is yearned for once the film reaches its turning point. Two Moroccan boys with their father's new rifle compete with each other's skill at shooting, it becomes a battle of pride, one shoots at a faraway bus. Blanchett is shot. Everyone thinks it's a terrorist attack. Moroccan police investigate. Does what they learn reach the ears of the desperate people on the bus stranded in a small village where Brad Pitt is desperately trying to save the life of Cate Blanchett, his wife? Meanwhile, we are intermittently dropped into the middle of a deaf-mute Japanese girl's life, angry at her widowed father and insecure about her detachment from the rest of her world. But we don't understand. We're looking for a connection to the rest of the film's events.The most interesting plot strand is the one involving Pitt and Blanchett's children in San Diego and their long-time Mexican housekeeper, who is forced to continue looking after the kids on the day of her eldest son's wedding in Mexico. So she takes the kids with her with the intent to bring them back. We know something is wrong, and the tension rises slowly.Babel's cross-cultural themes, the beautiful and greatly contrastive scenery and ambiance, and the typically crisp and gritty cinematography all are in top form, though I'm growing tired of Inarritu's style of underscoring his films. In a two-and-a-half hour film, I do not want to continuously hear the sporadic plucking of acoustic guitar strings that will stop who-knows- when, though there is some orchestral music mainly near the end that can be infectious.Most importantly with Babel, do not walk in expecting a political thriller or a violent action film. Its scenes of violence spark from its characters' linguistic tanglings and emotional tempests. It's a drama of epic proportions.",Babel
51,Chris Knipp,A spectacular failure,9,4 December 2006,"Ingenious though ""Babel's"" structure is (and it is welcomely easier to follow than his previous multiple narrative film, ""21 Grams""), terrible and sad as the events it recounts are, beautiful as the photography is, good as the acting is, when it's all over, you want to say, So what? Bad stuff happens in the Moroccan desert; to a beautiful, disturbed deaf mute girl in Tokyo; and on the US-Mexican border. Things are connected, Guillermo Arriaga's and Iñárritu's screenplay says, but people. . . aren't? Sometimes it feels as if the film's trailer had the basic titular ""Babel"" theme (multiple languages as God's punishment of man) better than the whole movie: it focused on Brad Pitt yelling long distance at his Mexican nanny and up close at a Moroccan man in a truck who doesn't know ""hospital"" means ""mustashfa"" (not that it would matter,since there isn't one anywhere near). For sure, a deaf mute girl has communication problems with the general public. Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) communicates on an animal level by showing her naked crotch and body to teenage boys and a police detective she finds attractive. Her girlfriend says her temper tantrums happen because she needs to get laid; but we learn her mother's suicide may also be behind her weirdness. This is too complicated to have anything clear to do with a rifle (once her dad's) that causes bad trouble for some Moroccans after it wounds the wife of a grieving couple (Cate Blanchett; married to Brad Pitt). Apart from Cheiko's story, the connections aren't far-fetched, but the way they're supposed to generate our interest in four separate sets of people in a narrative style that strives for simultaneity seems contrived.And ultimately the overall thinking of the film isn't clear. Is everything connected -- or are things simply out of joint? And what about good things -- does a 'butterfly effect' ever lead to them, too? Babel, like some other earnest omnibus films (""Crash,"" for example) loses touch, in its frantic rush toward grave outcomes, with the idiosyncratic and the comic, aspects of life that Shakespeare's tragedies, in their renaissance fullness, never fails to supply. It seems to subjugate the world's complexity to the simplicity of a thesis, even though that thesis is blurred.But this is too absorbing and accomplished a movie for us to write it off. Every scene of ""Babel"" is intense and real (allowing for the detachment we feel about over-exposed actors like Pitt and Blanchett, and the knowingness around seeing the chameleon García Bernal back as a poor Mexican again after being English, Chicano, half-French, etc.). The cinematography is great-looking (perhaps most knowing and stylish in doing a Mexican border town). The scenes of the Moroccans seem most authentic, not only because so well acted and directed, but because we don't know Moroccan well enough (if at all) to sense false notes or theatricality.It's been said that the deaf girl deserves her own separate movie. Perhaps so. But I'd put it differently. I'd say we deserve a separate movie about this tragic incident of the Moroccan boys and the American tourists, free of this girl's irrelevant story. The couple's ""illegal"" nanny is another matter. Her narrative is relevant to the couple, to all Americans, and to the Mexican filmmakers.After a while as sequences of the big blocks of events unfold -- Japanese deaf girl; Moroccans pursued by police; Mexican nanny lost in desert with wilting white kids; panicky Brad and scared Cate -- the shifts from one to another become more and more wearing because they have so little to do with each other. It's hard to care for all these people at once, in one 142-minute sit. You may almost wish each segment's content and direction weren't so clear; then the interrelationships might become more suggestive. This is how ""Adieu,"" Arnaud de Pallière's intriguing, too-little-known 2004 film about death and a country family and ""illegal"" Arab immigrants in France works. Its scenes and discussions are idiosyncratic and their connection isn't made clear, and so we, the viewers, become participants, and when we find solutions, we believe in them.Babel's connections -- Japanese guy gives away rifle to Moroccan guide; Moroccan boys take potshots; American woman becomes injured; nanny makes error of judgment -- are clear and credible. What's much less credible in the film's structure is how quickly all these events are dealt with, broadcast, and resolved. Brad Pitt must really be Brad Pitt to get a U.S. Medivac helicopter flown into the Moroccan desert within 24 hours of his wife's injury. Maybe in weeks or months Moroccan authorities would penetrate rural omertà and find the sharpshooters who plugged a tourist bus; here, though, it happens at once. The guide is found, and he tells who he sold the gun to, pdq. In French they call the ""grapevine"" ""le téléphone arabe,"" but still. And in hours or days this event in the Moroccan desert, a town where one guy has a phone, gets onto Japanese TV news so the cop the deaf girl flashed sees it at a drink shop. That sure is amazing. There's a lot we aren't told, that we'd need to know for this to seem possible.As the saying goes, a miss is as good as a mile. The talented Iñárritu's exalted aims and solemn humorlessness only make ""Babel's"" failure to add up to anything more embarrassing and disappointing. I liked Ashton Kutcher in ""The Butterfly Effect"" (a far inferior movie) better. Its preposterous and elaborate plot at least was fun to talk about. I also liked the director's debut film, ""Amores Perros,"" much better. It seemed to revel in trashiness, delightfully -- only moving on to solemn significance in the third segment. ""Babel"" tries to fly high from frame one, and it suffers the fate of Icarus. But Iñárritu's so good with actors, locations, and the camera, this still could be one of the year's best movies.",Babel
52,billcr12,Interesting saga,8,20 March 2012,"Babel is comprised of four separate stories which are connected after a series of troubling events, mostly of a racial nature. The first begins in Morocco where a sheepherder buys a rifle to kill the jackals attacking his sheep. He gives the weapon to his young sons to protect his flock. They fire the gun randomly toward the highway and an American tourist, Susan(Cate Blanchett) is struck by the bullet. Sue is on vacation with her husband Richard(Brad Pitt) and they are trying to rekindle a troubled marriage. The shooting becomes an international incident with rumors of terrorist implications.The second chapter begins with a Japanese girls mothers suicide causing her to act out by becoming sexually flirtatious. Two detectives visit and she mistakenly believes that they are investigating her mothers death. In fact they question her father about a hunting trip to Morocco where he gave his rifle to a local guide.The third segment ties into the first when Susan and Richard's nanny Amelia is at their house taking care of their two children while the couple are on vacation in Morocco. Due to the gunshot wound, they are delayed and Amelia decides to take the kids to Mexico for her sons wedding. After the nuptials, the trip back to the States becomes extremely troublesome. Babel is a bit long at almost two and a half hours, but I found it a compelling tale.",Babel
53,dfranzen70,"Excellent, bloody; well-communicated film",9,21 February 2007,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Babel weaves four disparate and seemingly unrelated tales into a distinct, gritty narrative about the importance of communication - and what can happen when it goes awry. The movie is oftentimes difficult to watch, with ultrarealistic cinematography and gutsy, honest performances from its entire cast, particularly Oscar-nominated actresses Adriana Barraza (Amelia) and Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko).Told nonlinearly, the movie describes the travails of a troubled married couple with a tour group in Morocco, played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Something in their past has driven them apart, and to help deal with the problem they have taken a trip together. Meanwhile, the sons of a shepherd fight over who's the better shot with their new rifle and fire a blast at the couple's tour bus, critically wounding Susan (Blanchett).Richard (Pitt) calls home in San Diego to notify the nanny of their children, Amelia; Amelia is in a bit of a bind, because she expected the parents home so she could attend the wedding of her son in Mexico. With Richard and Susan not returning soon, and with no one else available to watch the children, she takes them with her to the wedding.In Japan, a deaf-mute Japanese girl acts out in reaction to her mother's suicide, which she discovered; the virginal Chieko becomes a huge sexual flirt, even removing her panties in a crowded restaurant to flash older boys. Chieko craves human contact but feels that the world's even more shut off to her now than ever before, and she sullenly shuns even her father's attentions.It should go without saying that this film really isn't for everyone. It's gut-wrenchingly tough to watch at times, especially when Susan's wound is being treated. You can readily imagine how it'd be if you, an unworldly American, were suddenly in dire need of expert medical attention in a part of the world that wasn't really famed for it. That's enough to strike terror in me already, and I haven't even mentioned how Richard and Susan are awaiting help to arrive in a small, impoverished village with no running water or electricity - and only one person who can speak English to them.How exactly these stories are commingled becomes evident as the movie progresses, but it's not all elegantly laid out for the viewer to immediately grasp; this is accomplished in part by the nonlinear storytelling. We see a scene near the end of the movie that is a mirror image of one from the beginning, except told from a different character's perspective. That's a tribute to the wonderful camera-work and editing by, respectively, Rodrigo Prieto and the team of Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrone.Barraza turns in a powerful, heart-breaking performance; at one point, she's stranded in the middle of the Sonoran desert with her two young charges clad in her dress from the wedding. Dazed by the blistering heat, Amelia cannot gain her bearings in the blazing heat, and she despairs. Then she makes a critical decision with devastating consequences.Kikuchi is absolutely mesmerizing as the silent Chieko. Without uttering one word, she's able to convey a vast array of emotions, from loneliness to hostility to love to lust to affection. She's alternately serene and violent, in charge of and captured by her impediment. Chieko resents her father, her volleyball teammates, and most of all every so-called normal person who looks at deaf-mutes as monsters, creatures to be scorned and taken advantage of. Like Barraza, Kikuchi's role called for a difficult sacrifice: plenty of nudity.Babel is a spellbinding, multifaceted story with towering, passionate performances by all of the leads. It's full of moxie and stark realism, and despite some minor plot implausibilities, it's a true feather in the cap for Inarritu.",Babel

This movie is great and Brad Pitt proves once again that he is a great actor. Indeed, Mr. Pitt is probably the best actor in Hollywood today. But getting back to the movie, the director succeeds in presenting a story that builds to a climax that is truly dramatic and which include characters with whom they audience can empathize. Most poignant is the deaf mute Japanese girl who cannot express her anguish and the Moroccan man who refuses to abandon an American couple in their time of trouble. But most special is the Mexican housekeeper whose innocent actions produce such powerful and unintended consequences. With the one exception being the scene where the American couple are discussing an intimate bodily function, this movie is an excellent work of cinematic art and is worth watching.",Babel
55,meeza,Lots of language of movie love here!,9,13 December 2006,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is not a ""babeling"" Spanish name. It is the name of one of the most imaginative film directors in the cinematic arts. He has created another interlocking story masterpiece in ""Babel"". This one is even has greater weight than ""21 Grams"", his predecessor classic. In archetypal Inarritu style, ""Babel"" focuses on various narratives that intertwine in some methodological connection. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play Richard & Susan, an American couple visiting a Moroccan dessert. When Susan gets shot in a tour bus, Richard gets into a hurried state of ""Desperately Saving Susan"" by seeking help from dwellers in a Moroccan village. Chieko is the deaf Japanese teen who is not ""chiekin"" to display her sexuality and sentiment in a boisterous Japanese civilization. Cheiko's estranged pop is also too ""chiekin"" (yea, I know I am ""babbeling"" a lot) to demonstrate his paternal affection towards Chieko. Adriana Barraza portrays Amelia, the Mexican nanny who cares for Richard & Susan's children; she informs the kids if ""Tijuana"" attend her son's wedding without informing their parents. Gael Garcia Bernal plays Santiago, Adriana's jovial nephew who drives the clan to the wedding. Eventually, the risky journey becomes quite a ""Messico"" for all of them. If I keep babbling about the eccentric details of the multiple plots, then I would commit a major linguistic cinematic crime by giving too much away of these convoluted stories. The acting ensemble of ""Babel"" was ""Babelicious"". Pitt and Barraza are well deserving of supporting acting nominations. I hope the Academy is going to be ""Turning Japanese"" by also nominating Rinko Kikuchi who was vociferously mesmerizing as the mutie cutie Chieko. Guillermo Arriaga's meticulous screenplay should garner recognition credence during film award season. I would like to communicate with you that Inarritu's ""Babel"" is a towering achievement.

57,Chris_Docker,A shattering achievement,10,20 January 2007,"A Westerner arriving in Tokyo is easily non-plussed. English doesn't work and no-one is overly impressed with your wads of cash. Japan is highly sophisticated and not dependent on tourists. It doesn't need you. Impeccably politely, but, after all, who do you think you are?? You are in a different universe. Customs, day-to-day life, etiquette, everything. Even Macdonalds tastes Japanese.But Iñárritu's globe spanning opus is about more than the breakdown of communication between cultures - it's three interlocked stories show the breakdown within them. A naked girl on the balcony of a Tokyo skyscraper. A chicken's head being torn off in Mexico. The scream of an American stitched without anaesthetic in Morocco. Frightened children in the American desert. These are some of the vivid images punctuating his remarkable film. Taking as its metaphor the biblical Tower of Babel, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett head an ensemble looking at three civilisations where the ivory towers of communication crumble needlessly. Let's start with a couple of lonely goatherds. Adolescent lads with hormones a-raging. Dad's left them in charge of the flock and the youngest can't even get a w*nk in peace. Let's play with the rifle dad bought us to kill jackals. Bet you can't hit that bus! Bet I can! (So how's your day been, boys? Naturally they don't tell the truth - about the w*nk, the bus or playing peep-show on a girl through a crack in the wall. An elaborate fiction is assumed.)In Tokyo, a precocious teenager is also trying to get laid. Apart from being too young, she has the disadvantage of being deaf-mute. She lies about her mother's death to try and seduce a policeman. In San Diego, a Mexican nanny is looking after two children. She is planning to go to Mexico for her son's wedding. Her stand-in doesn't arrive and she decides to take the children with her. In an isolated part of Morocco, their parents are travelling on a tour bus when a bullet rips through and punctures the mother's shoulder. Her husband wants an ambulance but all he gets is a promise to 'hunt down the terrorists'. The rifle had originally been a gift from a Japanese businessman as a thank you for the kindness of his hunting guide.Babel is a shattering movie experience. It traverses three continents and four languages looking at the sophisticated levels of communication we build for ourselves but that crumble because no-one really listens.Instead of being purely action-driven, Babel lingers in each locale, soaking up the atmosphere, providing a realism that is frequently absent from mainstream films. Says director Iñárritu, ""We essentially made four different movies, trying to really penetrate four different cultures without using an outsider's point of view - the film itself changed in that I had to rewrite each story according to the cultures and circumstances.""He goes on to say. ""We talk about the border as a place only, instead of an idea. I believe that the real borders are the ones that exist within us."" Babel spares no opportunity to drive the metaphor home by juxtaposing the two. Near the Mexican border, children ask their nanny: ""Why are we hiding if we did nothing wrong?"" And she answers: ""They think we did something wrong.""Language keeps breaking down and protagonists rely on the physical. In Morrocco, a kind but scary-looking old crone offers Cate Blanchett an opium pipe to ease her pain. At the moment her pain is most intense we segue from primitive surgical conditions to the gleaming white of a Tokyo dentist's room. In the dentist's chair, the inner pain and frustration young Cheiko feels expresses itself in an unacceptable way. Blanchett's real pain is to do with the communication difficulties in her marriage and over her children. The father in Japan is having difficulty communicating with his daughter Cheiko. If there is a common denominator, it's probably more linked to pain than anything else.There are some political pot-shots at the US government's tendency to blame anything on terrorism, and also its inhumane border policy towards Latin-Americans, especially illegal immigrants who have been living and working in the U.S. for many years. But the main thrust of the movie is non-partisan and not about one country. It is about how we construct complex verbal structures to view the world and, in doing so, miss the wood for the trees.The complex story lines may be tiring for some audiences as the film winds over two hours. Although the parallel tales and involved timeframes don't all become clear until the end, they are however much easier to follow than this director's first two movies - Amores Perros and 21 Grams. It's good to see an actor of the calibre of Brad Pitt taking his career seriously enough to appear as part of an ensemble cast in what is essentially a high quality art-house melodrama. But, like Crash the year before, Babel's high production values and the precise delivery of its unashamedly high aspirations may well strike a chord with today's increasingly sophisticated multiplex audiences.The descendants of Noah built an edifice towards their highest aspirations (to reach heaven, or maybe avoid a second deluge) but they relied far too much on intellect and the false logic of words and paid the price. The story today is seen as little more than a fable to explain the multiplicity of languages in the world. It no longer speaks in our language, whereas the film gets back to the message of the heart. Fully deserving of the recognition it is achieving, Babel may not be the film you expect, but it may yet convince you that art in predominantly English-language films is at least not dead.",Babel
58,MaxBorg89,"A painful, emotionally devastating must-see",10,5 November 2006,"With his third movie, Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu delivers his most ambitious picture so far, staying faithful to his style (fragmented story lines, sad mood) but uniting it with a bigger scope (three completely different locations). The result is one of the year's best films, a gripping opus which will leave an indelible mark on the viewer.Babel tells three stories, all connected, set in Morocco, Mexico and Japan. In the first country we meet Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), who are on a vacation to understand what's destroying their marriage. That question will have to stay unanswered, though, as Susan is seriously wounded in an accident, leaving her husband alone in his struggle to save her. Because of this, someone has to take care of their children in San Diego. Normally it wouldn't be a problem, but on that particular day the nanny (Adriana Barraza) is supposed to attend her son's wedding in Mexico, and so she decides to take them with her, a decision whose outcome won't be pleasant. And somehow all of this is related to the sad life of a deaf Japanese girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi).As usual, Iñarritu moves between these episodes on his own terms: ""chronology"" is not a word you'll find in his dictionary. Babel is less demanding than 21 Grams, but nonetheless a complex picture, not just narratively speaking. Like in his previous works, the director analyzes human relationships and solitude, and the devastating effects the latter can have on us, as well as the people surrounding us every day. Given the setting of the story, Iñarritu also explores the difficulties of communicating (there are seven languages spoken in the film), how the unsaid can affect as much as the explicit message. By reflecting on these themes, the Amores Perros director gives us one of the year's saddest movies, the tragedy receiving more power from the intense, painfully honest performances Iñarritu gets from his talented cast. The most notable and poignant work comes from Barraza and Kikuchi, but also worth mentioning is a bearded, gray-haired Pitt, whose portrayal of a man on the brink of desperation might even provide him with an Oscar nomination. Rarely (Fight Club being the most famous exception) has he been so compelling.Strong and heartbreaking, Babel is one of 2006's masterpieces, second only to Scorsese's The Departed, and should receive quite some recognition once the awards season begins.",Babel
59,Nazi_Fighter_David,"A coherent, impressive, well-made, insightful piece of work",8,25 August 2007,"""Babel"" centers on several groups of people in 4 countries that are all connected by one freak accident Alejandro González Iñárritu takes us from North Africa to North America to Asia His film exposes four unconnected story lines that are eventually divulged to be inextricably linked to one another The first involves an isolated family of goat herders who live in the High Plateaus of the Moroccan desert where two young boys are testing a rifle's range handed by their father to protect their goats from jackals... The second concerns a Middle-class American couple on a bus tour of Morocco trying to save together their damaged marriage Meanwhile, in the US, there is grave danger for an undocumented immigranta Mexican nanny as she tries to return to United States after she wrongfully decides to take her two blonde-haired young charges to her son's wedding across the Mexican border, despite her employers' sudden change of plans, that needs that she remains with them and miss the joyful occasion And on the opposite side of the world, we follow, in Tokyo, an alienated, confused deaf and mute teenage student, recovering from her mother's suicide, who eases her feelings of depression and loneliness by trying to win the friendship or attention of every man or adolescent who crosses her path She flirts with sexual exhibitionism to attract the attention of her distant and uncommunicative father ""Babel"" tries to make a point and the point is that when people can't or won't communicate, unpredictable paths can lead to tragic consequences It also tries to leave a message of how a 'shooting' from a simple 'gift' can set off a chain reaction of tragic events in three continents and four countries over which the different characters have exceedingly uncomfortable human emotion Out of the entire cast, it is only Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko who steals the movie especially when she transmits to her friends her mad decision of sexual aggressiveness, saying to all: ""Now they're going to meet the real hairy monster."" This scene remembered me, in some way, Sharon Stone uncrossing legs in ""Basic Instinct.""",Babel
60,yusufpiskin,Trilogy of Death,9,25 December 2019,"From the director of Amores Perros & 21 Grams, Babel is the third & final chapter of Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu's Trilogy of Death which once again employs the multiple-narratives structure interconnected by a single event, further explores the prevalent themes of the last two chapters while adding a few more & features captivating performances from its much more diverse cast to finish the trilogy on an admirable note.Set in 3 different countries & interweaving 4 distinct plot lines, the story of Babel is triggered by a rifle bought by a Moroccan herder whose sons, while testing it, end up wounding an American woman who was vacationing there with her husband. When the two are unable to return home on time, their children's caretaker takes the kids to her son's wedding in Mexico while the ownership of the rifle is traced back to Tokyo to a man whose daughter is feeling rejected.Fabulously directed by Gonzáles Iñárritu & exquisitely scripted by Guillermo Arriaga, the film marks the last collaboration between the two as a director-writer duo and takes its story on a global platform this time to relay its message that even though we are divided by the distinct languages we speak & different cultures we follow, our simple acts of kindness do carry enough strength to transcend those barriers & bring us together in moments of tragedy.Compared to both Amores Perros & 21 Grams, Babel feels technically more sound than the two & even its non-linear narration is far easier to follow. Cinematography captures each moment in glorious detail & uses different hues for different plot lines. Editing unfolds the narrative in a very relaxed manner yet its 143 minutes of runtime is rarely felt. And Gustavo Santaolalla chips in with a minimal but highly effective score that seamlessly integrates with the presented story.Featuring an ensemble cast in Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Gael García Bernal, Adriana Barraza, Rinko Kikuchi & others, the film is packed with powerful performances from start to finish & Iñárritu succeeds yet again in bringing out the best from his cast. Pitt is absolutely magnetic in his part & it's one performance of his every fan will be proud of. Bernal rewards the director's faith in him wonderfully while the contribution of both Barraza & Kikuchi is as impressive as it is heartbreaking.On an overall scale, Babel is an expertly composed, steadily paced & emotionally distressing film that presents a very bleak portrait of the world we're living in yet concludes with a little glimmer of hope that there's still some good left in it. Despite the difference in our lifestyle, society, culture, customs, cuisines & languages around the world, our tragedies & circumstances are pretty much similar on a deeper level and if only we start to listen & communicate a little more, we just might get rid of our inexplicable hostility against one another. Highly recommende.",Babel
61,Kdosda_Hegen,Masterpiece. One of the best movies of all time.,10,9 May 2020,"Babel is an extremely beautiful 'conected stories' kind of movie. The stories were interesting, much depth and meaning put into them. The cinematography and music were so beautiful. The cast was amazing and so were the characters. The storytelling was great, slow start, with time reavealing more and more twists. This is a long and slow movie, but it wasn't boring for a second, I could't turn my eyes off the screen as it was such magnificient experience. The ambiguous ending is so marvelous too, it leaves us with some questions unanswered left for each viewer's understanding.

62,3xHCCH,Does not exactly succeed as a masterpiece,6,30 January 2007,"I find this movie very emotionally draining and exhausting. It is relentless in its depiction of sadness in this world. Compared to previous Inarritu movies, ""Amores Perros"" and the sublime ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" I felt was not the same level. It tries to expand its web of stories worldwide, but it did not feel as neat as the previous two, which were both amazing in their endings. The Japanese storyline, though similar in message of failure to communicate, felt particularly out of main stream of events. Its disturbing presentation of Japanese youth pop culture was way too long for me, though I understand it to contrast the noise of young Tokyo with the silence in Cheiko's deafness and loneliness.In terms of the acting, I must say I was impressed with Brad Pitt. That hospital scene where Brad was on the payphone talking to his son was very realistic and touching. While the actresses who played Amelia and Cheiko are OK, I did not really tag them as award-worthy.",Babel

64,EUyeshima,Extremely Provocative Omnibus Film Shows Our Indispensable Need to Connect,10,6 November 2006,"In general, omnibus movies which carry divergent story lines and multiple character arcs are risky propositions for the contrivances that occur in bringing the movie back to a more holistic experience. From my perspective, Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is a prime example of this hit-and-miss approach. Filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu, however, has provided quite an exception to the rule with this spellbinder of a film tied together by our often desperate need and frequent failure to communicate. It's by turns audacious, challenging and heartbreaking, as he and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga present a puzzle-piece yet clear-eyed narrative that tenuously links complete strangers in three different locales around the world.It opens in a desolate area of Morocco where a goat-herding family comes in the possession of a rifle which the father instructs his two pre-adolescent sons to use on jackals who threaten the goats. Through typical sibling rivalry, one of the brothers shoots at a tourist bus and accidentally hits a female American tourist named Susan. Fears of terrorism run rampant as her husband Richard frantically tries to find medical help for her in an isolated village. Back in the U.S., Richard and Susan's nanny Amelia needs to go to her son's wedding in Mexico, but she has no one who can take care of their two young children. With her hot-headed nephew Santiago driving, Amelia decides to bring the children wit her across the border. Meanwhile, there is an angry young girl in Tokyo named Chieko, deaf and mute, who is desperate for intimacy in light of an emotionally distant father and deceased mother.The stories gradually interlock in a non-linear manner that plays havoc with our sensibilities but not at the expense of the visceral punch that Iñárritu and Arriaga provide with each new revelation. It's simply startling how they are able to avert the potential contrivance of the running theme through the creative dexterity of the storytelling. It also helps that the acting is so uniformly strong in light of the various languages spoken and the cultural and socioeconomic differences presented. None get a huge amount of screen time, but they make lasting impressions. Cate Blanchett and especially Brad Pitt play Susan and Richard with economic skill and palpable desperation. As the young Moroccan brothers, Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid are particularly affecting, as is Mohamed Akhzam as the sympathetic guide Anwar.While Gael Garcia Bernal uses his natural charisma effectively as Santiago, it is the quietly devastating work of Adriana Barraza as Amelia that makes the worst-nightmare dimensions of their story feel so authentically heartbreaking. Nevertheless, the most surprisingly powerful work comes from Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko. Although her character initially appears to be a maladjusted J-Pop-obsessed teen, Kikuchi brings out all of Chieko's inner torment and vulnerability with fluidity. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is superb considering the variety of locales he had to shoot and still stay in tune with a uniform visual look, and Gustavo Santaolalla contributes another exceptional music score. Both did similarly accomplished work on Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"". This is first-class work full of cathartic moments and complex emotions. Strongly recommended.",Babel

67,aharmas,Will give you an emotional wake up call,10,4 November 2006,"""Babel"" is a film that does what no other American has done so far this year; it will provoke a visceral emotional response with its content, its powerful performances, and a hell of a trio of stories. This film works so well because it carries an emotional wallop. It is different because it appears to hide secrets when there are really none. The audience understands that a good tragic jolt does wonders to keep the audience's attention. In this film, there is drama, suspense, and of course, an excellent screenplay and director.Three stories apparently not connected, have much more in common than is possible. The film is like bad karma unleashed. In truth, one of the segments deals with emotional devastation, the other with bad judgment, and the last one with human mistrust. There are however common points, and it is indeed amazing how a good writer can weave just about any yarn and make it believable. This is why this film works because the director becomes an observer and places us as close observers (or voyeurs), giving us a front seat into the lives of two unlucky tourists, an reckless babysitter, and a lonely teenager who wants some emotional satisfaction.The film is gorgeously scored and photographed, calling no attention to the modern technology that has taken all the power out of cinema. This film feels like one of those classic 70's gems. It has strength that emanates from the self-assured hand of the creative team. There are no fancy camera angles or technology to soften the impact of a bad script. Here is a simple and ambitious project that takes the old fashioned way: good writing and good acting.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett prove once again they can do no wrong on the screen and Garcia Bernal is fantastic as the hot-tempered Mexican who doesn't know when it's time to stop. The real find is the Japanese actress who plays the despairing teenager. She carries her role with aplomb and expertise associated with professional performers, and she outdoes them.Be ready to face some ugly parts of nature and to go through an emotional wringer. ""Babel"" is a very strong and painful film to watch, but every second of it is worth it.",Babel
68,Sherazade,It might as well have been a silent movie,9,29 March 2007,"most of it was anyway. You didn't need subtitles or speaking roles to get the true impact the director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams, Amores Perros) intended. Babel was definitely 2006's CRASH, only more subtle. The message within the movie is that pain is universal but we did not need a movie to tell us that or do we?Babel begins it's tale with a poor family living in rural Morroco. A friend of the father in the household brings a rifle to sell to the family. The father purchases the weapon with some ammunition and (perhaps ill-decidedly) hands it over to his two teenage sons to go and shoot jackals. Children being children and boys being boys, the two end up aiming and shooting a passing vehicles on a nearby road, one of which is tour bus carrying a grieving couple Richard and Susan played Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett (it is later revealed that they are grieving the death of their infant son). One of the bullets ends up hitting Susan (Blanchett) the one person who hated being in Morroco in the first place. Richard (Pitt) frantically tries to save her life in an adventurous bid to get help in a forgotten land that takes him to depths of despair and ultimately tests the limits of his love for his wife as well as their union.Meanwhile, miles away in Tokyo, a young and deaf woman named Chieko (played by Rinko Kikuchi) is going through the motions with her life as a teenager who refuses to be handicapped by her handicap. If you're wondering what this young woman's life has to do with the storyline, don't worry because the link will be revealed later. Nevertheless, this storyline will prove to be the most faulty and mysterious of all the story lines present in the film. Trust me, I still have questions.Back home in America, Amelia (played by Adriana Barraza) the maid caring for Richard and Susan's children has a dilemma of her own. Her son is getting married in Mexico but because of the unforeseen circumstances keeping Susan and Richard in Morocco, she is forced to make a decision that will cost her big time in the long run. IMHO the performance of this woman was perhaps the single most noteworthy performance in the entire film. Don't get me wrong Pitt and Blanchett were great, as was Kikuchi, but Barraza's performance stood out like a secret in plain view. If Babel does nothing at all, it will make you think and it certainly has got people talking. Its only flaw was perhaps the forced tying of all the stories and people together in the end, which made it seem a bit far-fetched but that's okay, no one and nothing is perfect. See it for the great performances and cinematographic artistry. Ignore the sketchy story lines. A-",Babel
69,Galina_movie_fan,Vidas Perros,5,2 September 2007,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's first film ""Amores Perros"" that used multi-narrative style and told three intertwined stories abut lives, loves, passions, and losses of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs and that were connected by one fateful incident in the streets of Mexico City was a remarkable compassionate movie, a very successful debut that left me waiting for the next Iñárritu's film. ""21 grams"" (2003) which takes place in the USA, tells the story of three people whose lives become deeply connected through a horrific accident. It is IMO, the best Iñárritu's film, with three finest performances from most gripping actors working now, with three stories that take their heroes to such emotional, mental, and physical depths of despair, revenge, and promise of redemption that it is difficult to think of another such powerful film. In his latest and most celebrated film ""Babel"" (2006), Iñárritu went global and biblical on us. One city or even one country is not enough for him anymore. Several tag-lines advertised the film that connects (or disconnects) the characters of different cultures, backgrounds, languages, religions, and nationalities, and their stories. ""If You Want to be Understood...Listen"", ""Tragedy is universal"", ""A global disaster"", ""A single gunshot heard around the world"", ""Pain is universal... But so is hope"". I agree with all these statements, as for the movie...well, I am afraid it proves that its writer/director may be one trick pony who uses the same approach, the same tools and tricks over and over again. He reminds me of a cook who has learned how to make one dish only, and he keeps serving it to us under the different sauce an on the larger plates. This time, his sauce is not done well. All three stories are primitive, predictable, and poorly written. Some of them simply should not and could not happen. For instance, the story of Amelia, a kind and nice Mexican nanny who had to take two American children in Mexico with her to attend her son's wedding. According the law, if the USA citizens - minors enter Mexico without their parents, they MUST have a notarized letter of permission given by their parents or legal guardian. The nanny would've been stopped and questioned before she crossed the USA-Mexico border which would make the later heartbreaking scenes simply impossible. I wonder if Iñárritu chose to ignore the well known information on purpose to manipulate the viewers. Another question has been brought up often regarding the Mexican story. Why would Amelia let her obviously drunk nephew who had problems crossing Mexico-USA border before drive her and the children back to the USA? Why did Santiago (Gael García Bernal) behave so irrationally? We never found out. Three stories of four, of a nanny and an American couple, her employers, vacationing in Morocco where the wife (Cate Blanchett) was gravely wounded in a shooting accident, and of two Moroccan boys whose father handed them the fateful rifle which is a logical center of the film are connected. The fourth story though, that of a deaf-mute Japanese teenage girl in Tokyo, ""Rebel Without a Cause"", has very little to do with the rest of the stories. Actually, despite a strong performance by Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko), the Japanese part of the movie is weak and I think it does not belong to the movie. It is hard for me to believe that the attractive teenage girl is so desperate to lose her virginity - just to any man who crosses her path, no matter who he is that she would act in a manner immortalized by Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"". Judging by her behavior in ""Babel"", she does not want to be loved, she does not need a boyfriend who would kiss her, hold hands with her, no, she needs to be f_ucked. NOW! I think that her problems with the lack of communications due to her condition, her anger and frustration toward the ""normal"" boys who seem first to be interested in the pretty girls but would stay away after realizing that the girls are deaf-mute, and she silently screams to her friend, ""They look at us like we're monsters"", could've been solved by the writers easily had they provided Chieko with a chance to meet a boy of her age with the same disability. If they (the writers) came up with the girls' school for deaf-mute students, I am sure they could've shown similar boys' schools in Tokyo. But they were not interested in helping their own character. They found it more interesting to put her through the series of absolutely unnecessary sexually explicit and exploitive, humiliating scenes that did not contribute anything compelling or important to the film. In the end, I am afraid that ""Babel"" fits closely one of its tag-lines - ""A global disaster"". Even with some good performances, moody cinematography, and impressive Oscar winning musical score, it fells victim to its creator's ""global"" ambitions. The Japanese storyline rewritten and reworked could be another movie. As it is now, it brings to my mind a famous Russian saying which translates like ""An elderberry grows in the kitchen garden and my uncle lives in Kiev"", meaning , Mr. Iñárritu, please next time, don't mix apples and oranges.P.S. For the fans of Alejandro González Iñárritu who believe that he has started multi-narrative style. Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" was made in 1975 and it was followed by Altman's ""Short Cuts""(1993) and P.T. Anderson's ""Magnolia""(1999). Both films were made before Iñárritu ""Amorres Perros"" (2000).",Babel
70,nycritic,The Curse of Miscommunication,10,26 May 2007,"A bullet that hits an unintended target on a dare. An American couple caught in the maelstrom of the aforementioned rogue bullet. The children of this couple, also caught in unfavorable circumstances while their Mexican nanny crosses them into uncharted country. And a Japanese girl confronting her own isolation in a world that seems to be moving on without her.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film BABEL, much like the symbolic tower that caused panic and mayhem once people learned they could not understand each other anymore, is an overwhelming allegory of misunderstandings and misconceptions of how people perceive each other especially when caught under dire circumstances. A quadrangle of characters live within its four corners, each of them interconnected by subtle threads they cannot see, as the world around them slowly emerges as a crazy place where all that remains is the need to survive.Because of a rifle given to Abdullah and a dare to machismo, the stray bullet fired hits an unintended target and this act slowly constricts itself around Abdullah's household in a series of familial accusations before labelling them terrorists. Dreams and lives are destroyed and a stereotype becomes perpetuated.The American couple visiting Morocco could be seen as an advertisement for how we as Americans tend to behave when we visit other countries and bring our own self-entitlement to their cultures. Once Something Bad Happens, we go off on a tangent of ""get me the American consulate, immediately!"" that sets off a chain of events which reach international levels -- especially in a world dominated by the media. We could care less how we affect other people; our pain, our tragedy comes first, and everything else is second and should only serve as a means to achieving our solutions.Amelia, a Mexican woman who works as a nanny to for the Jones', wants to attend her son's wedding. Richard doesn't make it easy but this could be because of his crisis in Morocco as he fights for his wife's life. She decides to go, if at all for the evening, taking the Jones' two children with her, and in a moment of rare tenderness she finds romance. When she tries to cross the border into the US, a tense situation that could have been avoided develops and leaves her stranded in the middle of nowhere and with a very dark future ahead of her, because unfortunately for her, she lives in a country with severe laws that she has not been aware of and will leave her in a tough position.The final story, to me, is the most moving, and resonates far longer than the rest: Chieko, a deaf-mute girl living in Tokyo, unable to communicate not only with her distant father, but with anyone, and unable to reconcile herself with her mother's suicide. Inarritu brings her situation to the front of the camera as he makes us experience what she is going through -- the sense of living in extreme isolation -- as she desperately tries to make contact with anyone. Watching her literally scream out in pain, naked, at the rejection of a young detective who has come for some inquiries involving her father, was a gut-wrenching experience.BABEL is an excellent feature in how it places both adults and children in situations beyond their control. As adults, there are built-in pre-conceptions, but children are the way of the future so to speak, and placed out of their safety and in a world that crashes around them is a hard thing to watch but necessary for catharsis because such things have happened, and continue to do so. It's a fantastic, but devastating feature, and a collage of how we as people unable to relate to one another. Of all the actors involved, my heart went out to Rinko Ikuchi as Chieko, who literally became the little girl trapped in a woman's body, jailed for life in her own world.",Babel
71,gangstahippie,Great film in the vein of crash however not as good,9,6 October 2007,"Rated R for violence, some graphic nudity, sexual content, language and some drug use.I saw Babel about two weeks ago on the movie network.I heard it was a great film with great performances.It is.Babel will not disappoint the average movie goer.The film says it stars Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett but they have a fairly small role compared to the dozens of other cast members.The film alternates between USA,Mexico,Japan and a country in the middle-east.The film is in the vein of Crash and Pulp Fiction as the film is made up of stories that connect to each other.However I preferred Crash and Pulp Fiction to this film.The film starts off with two middle-eastern children firing their gun at a bus of American tourists for target practice.They do not mean any harm as they think the gun is bad.But they end up shooting an American woman ""Cate Blanchett"".So Brad Pitt who plays her husband, tries to nurse her back to health while some police look for the people who shot the tourist as they think it was a terrorist attack.Meanwhile the children of the couple are in America.Their nanny must go to her sons wedding in Mexico but cannot find anyone to babysit the kids so she brings them along with them.While the kids are in Mexico, they witness the culture, some entertaining and some shocking.We find out that the gun that was used to shoot the wife was owned by a Japanese hunter.This part of the story shows his relationship with his deaf daughter who is depressed ever since her mother committed suicide.She takes drugs and hangs out with her friends.Babel is a fairly interesting and good movie and if you liked Crash, you should check this out.",Babel
72,JuguAbraham,Lack of empathy or a problem of communication?,7,27 July 2008,"There is a revival of interest worldwide in making feature films that comprise several disparate stories that link up with a common thought or use a common location. This is now called the portmanteau film. Such films have sporadically surfaced over the decades but their appeal seems to be limited to the serious film goer. Babel belongs to that odd genre stitching together several stories, one taking place in rural Morocco, another set in towns on the Mexico-USA border, and a final one in urban Japan. Understandably you hear five languages--Berber, Arabic, English, Japanese and Spanishwith subtitles to help the viewer, not to mention ""sign"" language used by the hearing impaired.To understand the film one needs to know the historical meaning of Babel. Babel is a city described in Christian and Jewish scriptures relating to King Nimrod (The Book of Genesis). In that book, Babel was a city that united humanity by speaking a single language. But the King made the tower not for praising God but for the glory of man. The holy book says God was angry and confused the languages of the people, who eventually abandoned the building of the tower and went off to various far away lands because they could no longer understand each other's language.A simplistic approach to enjoying the film would be to evaluate all the actions of different individuals and the way each action impacts someone else in the world. In that perspective, the benign action of a Japanese tourist gifting a rifle to a tourist guide in Morocco, can lead to USA mistaking an accidental shooting by young boys for an act of international terrorism, while an American's refusal to be empathetic to his maid's request for a short leave to attend a marriage leads to deaths and loss of livelihoods for innocent but economically poor Mexicans. Lives are indeed connected in this global village of ours.However, another approach to evaluate the film would be to compare the interpersonal relationships of individuals from the developed world with those of the underdeveloped world. There is disconnection between husbands and wives (the US couple who cannot communicate to each other and reconcile the loss of third child until a worse tragedy overtakes them, a Japanese couple whose lives are a wreck in spite of riches ultimately leading to the wife's suicide) in the developed world. In the underdeveloped world, family ties are comparatively stronger (a Mexican housemaid uses all her resources to attend a close family wedding throwing basic intelligence to the wind, a Moroccan goat herder while chastising his three growing children who are inquisitive about sex, reinforces traditional family values of respect for each other's privacy).Yet another approach to the film is to analyze the varied attitudes of the personalities. It is interesting to note the bewilderment of an American man when a poor Arab refuses his money for helping his wounded wife. For an Arab, it is an insult to take money for helping someone in distress. The lack of communication is not limited to language (Arab vs. Berber vs. English vs. Spanish vs. sign language) or disability to speak (physical dumbness) but the lack of empathy (US officials manning a border crossing or the rich American putting his priorities on his personal worries over those of his less affluent Mexican domestic help). For the French tourists, their own safety and comfort takes priority over the problems of an American couple in distress. The film goes beyond the demands on people to listen to others; it grapples with the lack of empathy in relationships. Would the Mexican nanny have been more forceful in her phone communication with her employer if her financial security was better? Are our communications with people governed by economics? Hypothetically, if the entire world was financially secure and equal as in the days of King Nimrod-there would be only one language and perhaps we would understand each other better.The film has won accolades for the director Iñárritu but the writer of the script, Guillermo Arriaga, deserves equal credit. It is unfortunate if reports are to be believed that a spat between the two resulted in the director keeping the scriptwriter away from the Cannes festival where the director took all the credit. The film has howlers. For instance, a helicopter with a Red Cross in Morocco makes an appearance, when anyone in the Arab world knows that the Red Cross is replaced by the Red Crescent in that part of the world. This trivia probably ironically reflects the basic storyline of Babel.At the end of the film the viewer is nudged by the director to listen more to others. The film reiterates that the world has come to a situation where present day Nimrods can be pleased with the progress in the world and build ""towers of Babel"" but this progress is negated of we do not try to understand each other. The film clearly underlines one fact-no individual is bad and that everyone means well. Yet there is strife because everyone is living their lives for their own ends.My guess is that director Iñárritu took more than a handful of cues for this film from the 2005 Hollywood portmanteau film Nine Lives directed by Rodrigo Garcia and produced by Iñárritu himself. Garcia's film is more professional (it won awards at Locarno festival) and touches on several issues presented in Babel. But Babel with its Cannes award (interestingly the film was co-financed by the French) was marketed better than Nine Lives worldwide. If you liked Babel, see Garcia's (Garcia is the son of Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez) film Nine Lives. You will then know how Iñárritu apparently worked on Arriaga's script to make similar to Nine Lives, the film he had produced a year earlier! To Iñárritu's credit, he thanks Rodrigo Garcia and the brilliant Mexican director Carlos Reygadas in the end-credits of Babel.",Babel
73,zsenorsock,Babble,4,14 December 2006,"THIS got 7 Golden Globe nominations? THIS? They must've seen a different cut than I did.I found this film to be really slow, mostly pointless and very loosely interconnected. The whole Japanese section is a HUGE stretch. The filmmaker's version of how people get deported in this country is also made up of whole cloth. That's NOT how it works.I think Brad Pitt is terrific in just about anything he does and is usually a pretty good judge of offbeat projects (""12 Monkeys"") but here his character is adrift. Once they've stopped Susan's bleeding, doesn't it make more sense to get her on the road on a new, air conditioned bus heading for a hospital than leave her lying in a hot dirt hut, waiting for medical attention in the middle of nowhere? It's not like the bus was a rickety old bus with no suspension and full of chickens.The best written roles are those of the Morroccan kids and the Pitt's San Diego kids. Inarritu gets good, natural performances from all 4 kids that are a highlight of this painfully slow, depressing film that goes nowhere.",Babel

Movies are such collaborative efforts it's not easy to assign credit, but given Iñárritu's track record you have to feel that he is the creative force behind this, and the others lent their talents to realize his vision. Some people are born with a special talent and for Iñárritu it is directing movies. What would he be if there were no movies?""Babel"" skillfully interleaves four separate stories taking place in Morroco, California, Japan, and Mexico. In a couple minutes of quick cuts I got more distinct impressions of Mexico and Japan that I have gotten from any travelogue. The four cultures are contrasted, giving meaning to the title.Most people believe in free will, but ""Babel"" makes you realize how much our lives are controlled by random events that are quite out of our control. At various node points, with no evil or beneficent intent (as illustrated in this film), events vector us in directions that totally change our destinies.We are treated to some fantastic set pieces, like a Mexican wedding and a rave in a crowded Japanese nightclub. Never having been to a rave the one pictured here gave me an insight into the experience, or at least an experience like I have never had.An essential theme concerns the misunderstandings that result from language and cultural barriers. This theme is elevated to what happens when diverse countries deal with each other. From the viewpoint of each individual or country everything makes sense, but when they interact misperceptions abound.All the actors are in good form. Cate Blanchette's talent is a bit wasted in her limited role. The two standouts are Adrianna Barraza as a Mexican maid and Rinko Kikuchi as an anguished deaf mute Japanese adolescent. And Gael Garcia Bernal is proving to be one of the best young actors around.The score by Gustavo Santaolalla, coming off of his Oscar for ""Brokeback Mountain,"" is unobtrusive but effective.""Babel"" can be difficult to watch in many places, but I found it to be an experience to be valued.",Babel

77,valadas,How commonplace acts and events can cause dramatic results,7,20 July 2014,"The action takes place simultaneously or almost, in Morocco, México and Japan. A Japanese hunter in Morocco gives a rifle to his Moroccan guide as a reward. This gun ends up in the hands of a shepherd who lends it to his two children boys to go to kill the jackals that are killing his sheep. One of the boys decides in fun to shoot a tourist bus that is passing on the road below and wounds seriously an American woman who was traveling with her husband in it. On the other hand in US the woman who is taking care of the two children of this couple is forced to take them to her son's wedding party near the border in México because the children's parents cannot come in time to replace her while she goes there. The Japanese former gun's owner is also sought by the police in Japan. He has a teenager daughter who is obsessed with sex. From then on a succession of heavily dramatic events take place in those three places which are filmed with great realism visual and psychological and prove how commonplace banal events can cause very dramatic unpredictable results. A movie much worth to be seen.",Babel
78,DeeNine-2,Less than six degrees of separation,9,29 April 2007,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)There are some problems with this widely acclaimed film by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who previously gave us Amores perros (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), but they really don't matter because the film is so interesting and so very well acted and directed. The script by Guillermo Arriaga, who also wrote the script for Amores perros and 21 Grams, weaves the lives of people from Mexico, the US, Morocco, and Japan into a single story held together tenuously by the delicate thread of a bullet from a rifle.The rifle belonged to a Japanese businessman who gave it to a Moroccan guide after hunting in Morocco, who sold it to a goat herder, who gave it to his sons to shoot jackals. The younger son shot at a tour bus in which the very well-to-do American couple Richard and Susan (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are traveling, hitting Susan in the shoulder. Meanwhile, the two young children of Richard and Susan are being watched by their Mexican nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) who needs to attend her son's wedding. But she can find nobody to take care of the kids, so she takes them across the border with her to the wedding.It really doesn't matter how contrived this plot is (actually I thought it was rather creative) because the point is to show how connected we are all in this world. A butterfly may flap its wings in the Sahara and it may rain in Florida and maybe there is some cause and effect, as they tell us is possible in chaos theory. And maybe these people are no closer that six degrees of separation, and maybe their voices are babel to one another. But what Inarritu is intent on showing us is that we are all human and share the same feelings, whether a lonely Japanese girl looking for love in all the wrong ways, or a privileged very white woman in the desert with a bullet hole in her shoulder looking for the love of a husband she thinks she has lost. Furthermore, the character and worth of a Mexican nanny is equal to that of a Japanese tycoon which is equal to that of a Moroccan goat herder which is equal to the of little white girl, and so on.While most people admired this movie, and it received many awards and nominations for awards, some viewers did not like it; and some of those viewers vented. When a good movie is trashed because it has a few plot holes or because the logic is a bit off, you can be sure that the person doing the trashing has been offended. Usually it is some kind of sexuality depicted that offends. Sometimes the source of the anger is political or even racial. Here it definitely could be sexual since we see some under age sexual activity (masturbation and exhibitionism) done in a somewhat kinky way. Or it could be that some viewers did not feel sympathetic toward the deaf and mute Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) or were disgusted with a boy who spies on his sister and then gets sexually aroused. Or it could even be that some viewers really were offended by the stupid behavior of some of the characters.Surely Amelia could have found somebody to watch the kids. Surely she knew it was dangerous to return to the US with her drunken nephew Santiago (Mexican heart throb, Gael Garcia Bernal) at the wheel. And of course the selfishness of Richard and Susan to put her in such a spot was wrong. And the pathetic desperation of Chieko acted out in such a blatant manner, as she throws herself at men must have offended many. To me, though, the psychology projected by Inarritu and Arriaga was striking and largely compelling even while it was controversial. When a young girl presents her naked body to a man and is rejected, it could be psychologically devastating to the girl. She is offering her entire self to him and he does want her. And perhaps the ambiguous question of why she appeared naked on the balcony as her father comes home and embraces her is troubling. We what to understand what is being asked and answered here. Something troubling to the ordinary human psyche perhaps.Anyway, do not let the nay sayers dissuade you from watching this excellent movie. Regardless of how one might feel about the ideas of Inarritu and Arriaga, they are very much worth viewing in an artistic, a psychological, and a political sense. It may seem easy to construct a movie with a rising sense of tension and to develop characters that will interest the audience with just a few scenes and even fewer lines, but it isn't; and to do it with such a convoluted plot is even more remarkable.So see this for Inarritu who got the most out of the actors, from top drawer professionals like Pitt and Blanchett to beginners like Boubker Ait El Caid who played the younger Moroccan boy, Yussef, and for Arriaga who wrote the excellent script.",Babel
79,Screen_Blitz,"Mesmerizing, yet complex tale of humanity and tragedy packed with rich storytelling",8,11 December 2016,"Mexican director Alejandro G. Inarritu's boasts a complex tale of on the physical and emotional tragedy of human nature, and with the fine director's inventive direction; it is certainly an ambitious one. Parring up with writer Guillermo Arriga, Inarritu flourishes an emotional journey packed with melancholy, hope, and calamity and expands upon multi-dimensional proportions. What later becomes the final outcome is a story where unlike traditional narratives, doesn't boasts a powerful antagonist but instead characters robbed of innocence from an unintentional chain of fateful events. Inarritu greatly accomplishes this with an effective balance of multiple sets of interrelated characters of different cultural backgrounds, embraces a style that feels reminiscent to his previous projects including '21 Grams' and 'Amores Perros'. Told in a non-linear perspective, this film tells the story of three interrelated events set in four different countries. The story sets off with two young Morocco boys who fire M70 Winchester at bus accidentally striking and injuring an American tourist Suan (played by Cate Blanchett) who's vacating in Morocco with her husband Richard (played by Brad Pitt). This incident sets off a chain of events involving Richard and Susan's children (played by Nathan Gamble and Elle Fanning) and their Mexican nanny Amelia (played by Adrianna Barraza) in San Diego, Amelia's reckless nephew Santiago (played by Gael Garcia Bernal) in Mexico, and a sexually aggressive teenager Chieko Watayta (played by Rinko Kikuchi) in Japan.This multi-layered drama piece is no easy to watch as it tackles some deeply somber material, but Alejandro G. Inarritu brings a hefty hand to evolving the film's story into a visceral journey that feels very human. Kicking off the story of two youngster experimenting a firearm that ends in unexpected consequences, Inarritu drives the story through a compelling and emotionally jarring storyline where we encounter some extravagant characters of different locations around the globe who fall into the fate triggered by a single episode. And it all happens in the form of the chaos theory, the concept that symbolizes how the smallest occurrences have the potential to lead a devastating effect. The opening Moroccan sequence serves as the springboard for the dramatic multiplex that transpire from the wife of Brad Pitt's character suffering a grisly injury forcing their illegal Mexican nanny back at home to go to dangerous lengths to take care of their two young children. With a rich sense of storytelling empowered by Guillermo Arriga's script, these story lines not only demonstrate an authentic sense of poignancy but gracefully makes up for the sequences that don't work as well. Most of which take place in the Japanese storyline which explores the sexual confusion of an inexperienced adolescent. While this storyline integrates plenty of shock and awe, it feels a weak and little disjointed to the plot as it lacks the emotional investment to the narrative core in a way that renders it almost pointless. Nonetheless, these vignettes successfully string together to form a vibrant, if slightly flawed story. And rarely does it sways away from its emotionally exhausting atmosphere.This film notches a wide smorgage board of actors, most of whom manage to knock the ball out of the park with their performances. Brad Pitt, easily the most recognizable one of the bunch, delivers a spectacular sense of poignancy and hope as the husband Cate Blanchett who spends the majority of her screen time in physical ill on the ground with a bloody shoulder. Adrianna Barraza who plays the nanny of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett left at home with their two children gives plenty of humanity and melancholy in her role, as does Gael Garcia Bernal in his role as her brash nephew who recklessly takes matters into his hands when circumstances go south. Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi delivers a rather off-putting portrayal of the angst teenager girl who ventures into a complicated world of sexuality. This is when the film digs into more explicit (and somewhat absurd) subject matter, though it pays barely any to the main plot until the very end. The storyline set in Morocco, while the major powerhouse of the plot, serves perhaps the weakest from the performance department sporting a barrage of zero experience actors who nonetheless deliver some fine performances; but nothing memorable.Babel is a vibrant, yet deeply complex film that tackles themes of humanity and tragedy in one of the most potent forms ever put to film. At best, it makes for an intelligent, if tough-to-sit-through cinematic experience that sheds light on the ambitious talent of versatile director Alejandro G. Inarritu as well a screenwriter Guillermo Arriga.",Babel
80,dunmore_ego,Babel-icious,10,18 May 2007,"Four stories intertwine, spanning continents, cultures, cityscapes and chicks without panties.*Babel* is an exhausting, challenging movie, a masterpiece of construction from writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu; a tale of alienation amongst the throng, of chest-grabbing desperation and fear and isolation  emotionally defibrillating your brain. You come away from *Babel* nauseous.That's what makes it so rewarding. Constructed in non-linear fashion, we are introduced to the characters in *Babel* via sideways leaps in time. Their interplay does not become obvious right away as director Iñárritu juggles causality and consequences, actions and reactions.Two young Moroccan brothers, tending their sheep on a rocky hilltop, practice shooting a rifle their father gave them as a present, aiming at faraway traffic on the arid, dusty road; a pair of white, young American children are driven south of the border by their Mexican nanny trying to make her son's wedding, then find that the U.S. Border Patrol will not allow the illegal nanny back into the country with them; an insecure deaf, teen Japanese girl, desperate to roll with the in-crowd, tries to lose her virginity with awkward abandon; a couple cheerlessly holidaying in Morocco face near-death from a senseless, accidental shootingExcept for three main characters, Iñárritu casts unknowns, with many of the Moroccans non-actors (Boubker Ait El Caid and Said Tarchani as the two boys, Mustapha Rachidi as their father, Driss Roukhe as Captain Alarid), yet each of them an acting marvel. Of course, Brad Pitt is onboard (looking suitably haggard) lending marquee strength, but rather than his presence dragging the production into Cheese Hollywood, the movie actually takes *him* the other way into nuance, as he battles to understand the culture and language of the low-caste Moroccan village he is inadvertently trapped in with his wife (Cate Blanchett), shot accidentally by one of the boys.Even though the Moroccan boys are responsible for shooting a stranger and causing insurmountable misery, there is no ill feeling towards them, as the movie shows us how their unthinking act also impacted them even more adversely than their unintended victim. We feel the same way towards the nanny who irresponsibly takes her two young charges out of the country and is then made to suffer overwhelming fear and near-death in the desert for her stupidity. In all four stories, no one is innocent, yet being guilty does not make us hate them. Three of the stories are very solidly intertwined (the shot woman, the Morrocan boys, the children in Mexico). The fourth story takes a good time to slot into any relevance, that of Chieko, the Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi), although her predicament is a story unto itself.With the main theme being isolation, writers Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga convey that language is not the only obstacle that people might have to overcome in communication  Chieko's deafness (and by extension, any disability to the human condition) is just as isolating. Going panty-less everywhere in her quest to lose her virginity, Chieko not only does those normal things that teenagers do (in the grip of wild hormones and wilder drugs) but overcompensates in her quest for acceptance as a deaf person. In a nightclub scene (that alternates between sense-glutting and suddenly ripping to vacuum when we see the clamor from Chieko's soundless point of view) Iñárritu captures that indefinable euphoria of teen puppy love  and how it is dashed to pieces, as Cheiko realizes the teen boy whom she felt a connection with would just as haphazardly ""connect"" with her best friend. She is driven to boldly throw herself sexually at a police officer, who ethically refuses her awkward advances. The Border Patrol scene (involving Monica del Carmen as the nanny, Gael García Bernal as her impetuous driver and Clifton Collins Jr., in a chilling performance as a Border Patrol Guard) strikes close to home for Californians, and shows us how immigration procedures, while useful to a *country's* security (read as government's greed), only create horror and pain for individuals. Bernal's performance in this film outshines Pitt, as Pitt's on screen time is packed solid with ""Oscar Clips,"" while Bernal (like his smoldering role in *Y Tu Mama Tambien*) makes ""acting"" look like business as usual. In a way, I feel sorry for Pitt because he needs to pull off so much extra acting-choppery to convince time and again that he is not just a pretty face. Not EVEN a pretty face, as it stands in this production, prompting many reviewers to comment he ""plays against type"" in *Babel*(whatever ""type"" they've burned into their minds - as far as I'm concerned, Pitt has always displayed a great acting depth; he just happens to be burdened with that glam-slamming mug and taut obliques).Why can't more people make films this good? (That question answers itself when Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell enter the equation as economic gears.)You come away from *Babel* with your guts broiling, vowing to try to understand the plights of others  or at least vowing to get your immigration papers in order before attending that off-the-hook party in Tijuana.",Babel

Brad Pitt and wife Cate Blanchet go off on the road to Morocco, miss Bing and Bob by a hair, and she gets shot. Instead of putting her back on the tour bus they arrived in, Pitt awaits an ambulance that never comes. A helicopter finally arrives, but before then we get to watch Blanchet use a bedpan. In closeup. Back home, an illegal Mexican nanny takes Pitt's two children along with her to a relative's wedding in Mexico. On the return trip, she loses them in the desert for awhile. Over in Japan, an emotionally disturbed deaf girl who has witnessed -- or may have caused -- her mother's death gets naked in front of the cop interviewing her. I wish I could say she was the Japanese equivalent of Jennifer Love Hewitt, but no such luck. Her only connection to the plot is that her father, who apparently abuses her, sold his gun to the Moroccan who shot Blanchet. Watch MAGNOLIA instead.",Babel
82,Maciste_Brother,Overwrought collection of underwritten stories overpopulated by underdeveloped characters,3,5 December 2006,"BABEL was one of the most annoying film experiences I've had in quite a while. The film is a bunch of moments, senses and experiences which, at first glance, seemed to be powerful and imaginative but once I gave it a critical look at it, very little held up together.The concept is cool and I like that the story took place all over the world but the stories' themes and characters were disparate at best and had very little to do with each other. Though most have criticized the story set in Japan, I find the one that had the least to do with all the others was the one in Mexico, where the Mexican nanny brings the American couple's kids to her son's wedding south of the border. Not only did that story didn't make any sense whatsoever (why would the woman bring the kids to Mexico after learning the kids' mother was shot in Morocco? It defies logic) but what was the point really? At least the other stories were all about Morocco: the Japanese business man hunted in Morocco; the American couple are traveling in Morocco; the two kids live in Morocco. Not only is the Mexican story pointless but it shows how weak the writing is concerning the film's endless number of underwritten characters. Gael García Bernal's participation in this movie is almost a joke. His character is one of the worst written I've ever seen in a movie. An unknown actor could have played the character and it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever. The same thing could be said for Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's characters. Who were they really? Three quarters into the movie and I still had no idea who they were. The two young Moroccan kids were the film's best characters and they're unknown actors. The Japanese girl was also interesting but the constant degradation her character was made to go through was sad. And why did the director had to put the kids in constant jeopardy? Did we really need to see all these kids suffering? To make things worse, we never know what happens to those Moroccan kids and yet the director made an effort to show (in a big way) how the story with the American couple ended. This oversight made me really angry.BABEL is so overwrought in its relentless melodramatic treatment of the thin story-lines and characters that it creates an unpleasant lopsided effect: we see all these strangers going through over-the-top moments, every single one of them ending up crying at one point during the climax, that the grand operatic effect the director probably attempted to achieve left a bad taste and ended up looking more myopic and exploitive than anything else. The director was only concerned in having these thin characters be in pain and suffer relentlessly. Too much melodrama for people, in the end, we hardly knew.As much as I disliked BABEL I have to say that there were a few moments that showed promised. I can see what the director tried to achieve but missed it by a wide mark. So much potential, all for nothing. As I said, one of the most annoying film experiences I've seen in a while.",Babel
83,antoniotierno,sad and painful but gripping,7,1 November 2006,"Several dramas told effectively, the story is well tension-filled. Like Syriana and Crash it tries to depict the post 9/11 world concerning with big issues and showing us different languages, faces and strong imaginary. Events are ""multidimensional"" and narrated by the same technique as ""21 Grams"", that means strong emotional experience, anger, violence and hatred. In my opinion it wouldn't be worth an Oscar but deserves for sure many acknowledgments for the complex character development as well for its being shockingly unconventional.

84,bobsgrock,"A rich, complex, and thought-provoking film.",9,20 March 2008,"Babel is one of the best films of the decade; a rich and complex film with multiple story lines and numerous characters. Under the helm of many other directors, this would falter, but here Alejandro González Iñárritu perfectly directs each story and connects them in an understandable manner. What really intrigued me was how he always seemed to cut right in the middle of a very important part of a story. It's almost as if he is saying to us to not get caught up in one story too much and forget about the others. Each story could stand on its own as a film, but the director wisely only tells part of each story so we don't start to make assumptions and try to guess about things we don't know. The acting is terrific, especially with the foreign actors. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are good, however not on screen long enough to be really effective. Perhaps the most tragic story was that of the deaf Japanese girl, whose mother committed suicide and father ignores her. She fills her time with trying to seduce any man in order to trick herself in thinking she is loved. It is sad and shocking, as is the whole film. It ends on somewhat of a hopeful note, but it isn't real clear. Still, as a whole, Babel is a very powerful and thought-provoking film that isn't for younger audiences but should be a very satisfying experience for mature ones.",Babel
85,areatw,Smart and ambitious but frustrating to watch,6,2 April 2020,"I'm generally not a fan of non-linear storytelling in films - there is usually no reason for it and it can be frustrating and difficult to follow the plot. While the plot in 'Babel' is relatively easy to follow, the film still suffers the same annoying problems as other non-linear films.The most irritating thing for me is how scenes that are connected and happening at the same time are presented so far apart. At the very start of the film we see kids fire a bullet at a coach, yet the scene that logically goes together with this from inside the coach does come until a significant while later.The viewer also never gets to properly know any of the characters - there's no time for any character development as the film is constantly going back and forth between characters and situations. As a result, you don't really care for what happens to any of them.The saving grace of 'Babel' is its ending, which brings everything together and wraps the story up nicely. Even though it can be a frustrating watch at times, 'Babel' is a smart and well-made film.",Babel
86,Philby-3,Who needs babel fish anyway,8,24 January 2007,"This is a clever piece of story-telling with the camera and sound track doing as much work as the script. The story, or rather the interconnected stories, could be entitled ""people in a jam not acting as well as they might."" Though we teeter on the edge of disaster, and there are unpleasant consequences, at the end of the day things are not as bad as they might have been.The harshness of the Moroccan desert and the almost nature-free ambiance of a large Japanese city are an interesting contrast. So are the various security forces  I decided that if I was going to be arrested I'd much prefer the Japanese police, who are politeness personified, over the Moroccan, who shoot first and ask questions later, or even the US Border Patrol, who seem to take offence very easily. Global communications are now so good that a day or so after a shooting in Morocco, the Japanese police can be at a hunter's doorstep in Osaka to check whether he owned the rifle involved, yet it takes days to get an ambulance to an injured tourist in Morocco because of bureaucratic delay even though details of the case have been flashed around the world.It is interesting that it is not language that is the prime cause of misunderstanding here, but culture. ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" had the remarkable Babelfish for instant translation, but even such a marvellous creature could not tell you why a person is saying what he is, or even why he is smiling.In this world there are no heroes, though some people do behave very well; the Moroccan tourist guide who stays with the injured woman and her distraught husband for example. Iñárritu has said he saw the movie as being more about family relationships than anything else, but the family dynamics are not really behind the action, which is best explained in terms of chaos theory  the Amazonian butterfly causing a typhoon in the Philipines.It's an engrossing story well told except that the overlapping timelines cause occasional confusion  it is not apparent until almost the end that the Mexican episode takes place after the Moroccan one (I think). I haven't seen the two earlier parts of the ""trilogy"", but watching them on after the other would be an experience.Oscar territory? Well that depends on the competition  I'd have to say it was intriguing, but no cigar. It's a director's movie, not an actor's one, and Brad and Kate do not get a chance to flaunt their egos, though Adriana Barazza, who has been nominated best supporting actress for her role as the Mexican nanny, was very good indeed. Maybe it's the ""best foreign language film in English"". It is very encouraging to see a film with such a Latin-American sensibility doing well with Anglo audiences in the United States.",Babel

This is just plain bad.This is a film that has four separate stories that are connected in the most tangential ways, that it is a mere excuse to just tell four stories, none of them are particularly interesting, and then justify the ""connections"" in the most ridiculous way. It's like showing someone choke on a peanut in an Oh Henry Chocolate Bar, and then show the ""connection"" that man has with the child that picked the peanut in Burma who happens to burn his hand at the same time the man chokes. Sounds confusing? Sounds convoluted? Sounds stupid? Try watching this movie, you'll get the point. This is a film that could have been wrapped up in 90 minutes, but instead, what we get are pointless and excessive shots of 10 minute drinking binges at a wedding. We see the band playing, people about to make love that does nothing to further the plot of the story. You have a young kid who spies on his sister and then masturbates while leaning back against a rock. You have a deaf girl who tries to screw every person she can find. You have an Ecstasy fest in a Japanese disco, and then you have Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett who are literally relegated to crying and peeing and making out in the film. How this film got made is one of the great mysteries of the year. And now that it is nominated for myriad of Oscars, it should give everyone who is a would be writer hope. If this tripe can get made and get an A-list star to back it, then we can all write a piece of crap and then get it made. My next story is going to be about a colony of ants that has to coexist with a family of anorexic and dyslexic Arabs who have an uncle in Japan who might have sold some sushi to a couple in Australia who might have shot some dingos with a Beebe gun. They are all connected somehow. George Clooney and Cameron Diaz are interested in the script.I'm not really sure what the point of the film is, but everyone in this film does the wrong thing at the right time. If you are a Mexican woman with two American kids, would you think the best thing to do is cross the border while you and your driver have been drinking for 12 hours at a wedding? Do you not think that would raise suspicions? Do you not think that the alcohol would be detected? I grew up in a border town, right across from Detroit (Windsor) and I was nervous crossing the border sober after coming back from a Red Wings game. How anyone could be this odiously zealous is beyond me. And I guess you can say that this stuff happens all the time, but really, does it? Or is this just another filler in a film filled with incoherent situations performed by idiotic people? I just can't figure it out.If you want a plot, then here it is. An American couple are on vacation in Morocco. One of them gets shot by two young Moroccan boys who are playing with their new gun in the hills. Then you have a pretty, young, vibrant, deaf-mute Japanese girl who wants to have sex with every boy or man she sees. She literally flashes her vagina to a young man in a shopping mall or whatever hangout they are at. Then she tries to sleep with her dentist, and then she gets completely naked for a policeman. And why? Because her mom killed herself and she is now lonely. Then you have the American couple's kids left alone with their Mexican nanny and she is told that she cannot go to her own son's wedding because Brad and Cate are still in Morocco. So she takes them anyway and she has sex with some dude at the wedding. This entire plot could have been done away with and the movie still would have been bad, but not as bad. The Crash-like connections in this film are so minute that they come across as desperate. The film doesn't flow and Brad and Cate are terribly miscast as husband and wife. The script in this film is unbelievably inept and when reading the screenplay, I honestly wonder if it actually alluded to the fact that there were going to be 3 minute segments with Mexican Wedding Bands playing tunes you have never heard of. Did it tell you that there would be stretches where you would be so puzzled by the actions of the characters and shocked by the lack of logic that you would want to walk out? Probably not.And by the way, why wait for an ambulance, when you have a bus? And one last observation. Is this the bullet that killed Kennedy? The magic bullet? Because apparently it was able to turn left in mid air and then conveniently land in Cate Blanchett's shoulder. Just wondering.3/10 And only because Kikuchi was believable as the pretty, vibrant, deaf, horny girl in the film.And one final note....thank the movie Gods this did not win anything significant on Oscar night!",Babel
88,mstomaso,"Thoughtful, edgy, engaging and ambiguous",9,25 November 2006,"Babel is one of the most intelligent and artfully made films of 2006. The film has two central themes - culture and communication. It also exposes the connections between these themes in the arenas of politics, religion and geography sensitively and intelligently. The tag-line, though intentionally obtuse, sums the film up well - ""If you want to be understood... Listen"" - The parable is designed to speak to people all over the world who seem to believe that the meaning and importance of political boundaries somehow supersedes the value of humanity. It has especially important messages for Americans, however. And its release was well-timed to coincide with an election (2006) which may, in the long term, provide some hope for American foreign policy.The film brilliantly weaves four deeply interconnected stories engaging five cultures on three continents. The cultures are North American, Mexican, Moroccan, Japanese and Japanese/deaf. At the heart of each tragedy is an inability to communicate. The tragedies begin with bad decisions that spin each plot somewhat out of control once cultural interference and miscommunication kick in.Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett play a troubled American couple having very little fun on a vacation in the Middle East. Susan (Blanchett) is shot by a young boy practicing with a gun (The two Middle Eastern boys who play the brothers in this film give Oscar-worthy performances, unfortunately I can't get their names out of IMDb easily). Three crises are simultaneously set off, as the Americans' nanny must find a way to attend her son's wedding in Mexico while Susan's medical crisis unfolds, and the poor Islamic family responsible for the gun begin to undergo a devastating crisis of their own. Of course the United States executive branch (not the government - sorry, we are still a democratically organized republic regardless of who sits in the oval office) interprets the crisis as an act of terrorism and a political crisis threatens to doom Susan to bleeding to death in a small remote town in the desert. Finally, in a seemingly disconnected story, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a young, deaf, Japanese volleyball player is coming of age. Her mother has committed suicide and she seems bound to work out her problems with her father by devoting herself to a lascivious lifestyle.The performances are, all around, excellent. The directing is exquisite - perfectly paced and visualized. This is a great film which, despite its commercial pedigree and big budget, achieves a rare level of artistry - proving that blockbusters do not have to be sold short. Babel will make you think, and think well. Make sure you bring your attention span and brain, however.Very highly recommended.",Babel
89,sarastro7,I'm not sure what the point was...,5,26 February 2007,"I'm not a big fan of downbeat movies. Babel is a tale of the underbelly of human nature; a tale of stupidity, misunderstandings, alienation, callousness and misanthropy, not to mention unfortunate coincidences. To a degree it is very realistic and paints a picture of a contemporary world rife with problems that nobody cares enough about to try to solve.But I also think the movie went overboard in a couple of places. The bus-load of Western tourists in Morocco; man, it would have been nice if just *one* of them actually showed some sympathy to Blanchett's character, and tried to help a dying woman at the time when she needed it the most. I can't believe that every single one of them only thought about themselves. But, I suppose there was a point to this. I suppose it was symbolical of how most people are essentially alone, esp. in the Western world where the kind of communal networks that exist in the Third World have virtually disappeared. Maybe that was the point.The other thing I thought was pushing it was the maid - an illegal alien - taking the American kids with her to Mexico. No way she would do that. No way Pitt and Blanchett's characters didn't know anybody else at all who could look after the children. That's just stretching credibility too far.Another problem I had with the movie was that it was too slow-moving in many places, and just too dull. We saw lots of stuff that wasn't integral to the story at all, or so it seemed. Maybe there was a point to the whole wedding thing in Mexico; maybe it was to allow us to get into the humanity of the characters - but I don't think it worked. Most of what went on did not evoke the emotional response in me that the director was obviously going for.I also didn't think there was enough connection between the various stories. We were told of what little connection there was much too late in the narrative. The unaligned sequence of the various events did not particularly add anything interesting to the story and came across as pretentious.Still, it was an art movie with many different layers, which can be interpreted in many different ways, and I'm sure there are many elements of it that I have not penetrated, esp. as regards the Mexico trip.Pitt and Blanchett's characters were, again, over the top in downbeatness. Not only does she get shot far away from medical facilities; no, there also has to be some devastated relationship beforehand, doubling the disaster to a twice as unbearable level. It's far too much to empathize with, I'm sorry. Especially when the characters are not very alive to us, because we don't know until later what has happened.So a lot of things in this movie just didn't work for me. There was more to think about in the Japanese story. Some have speculated about an incest angle, and I have to say that there is in fact a lot to recommend that interpretation. The theme is first established when the Moroccan boy spies on his sister. Then there is the comment about the friend's father in the locker room. And what clinches it is the mother's suicide. We are not made privy to the details, but that silence also speaks. Mom shoots herself with the father's rifle? First of all, why? It must be because of something the father did. Secondly, the rifle is a phallic symbol - the father's. Thirdly, Chieko desperately solicits sex from virtually any man she meets, which is a classical attempt to normalize a sex life that has so far only been abnormal. So yes, I have to say I believe the incest angle.But I understand why some people wouldn't, because the movie has plenty of elements that provide alternative explanations. For instance, the girl is deaf, so maybe that's why she has problems having a normal teenage life of boyfriends and sexual exploration.As for the final scenes, well, there are some revelations that are very abrupt - too much so. And it remains a mystery if Chieko was thinking of killing herself or what, and if so, why she didn't, and what she wrote to the police man. These things are not properly shown, and maybe that's on purpose. But based on the evidence available, it's virtually impossible to know what the bloody hell was going on.Also, we never heard about how the children were saved. And we never saw Pitt and Blanchett's characters' reaction to the kids' Mexican misadventure. It seemed to me there were some unfinished and unresolved plot lines left hanging at the end.So, I didn't like the movie very much, and my final rating reflects that, although I'm also giving it points for being multi-layered and for at least provoking some thought and debate. Oh, and I did enjoy the soundtrack, so I'm glad it got an Oscar nod for that - just as I'm glad it didn't get anything else at the Oscars.5 out of 10.",Babel

91,jaredmobarak,The brightest lights on the darkest nightsBabel,10,11 November 2006,"The final piece to Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga's unofficial trilogy has finally reached theatres. Babel is a sprawling tale spanning multiple countries and languages as a lone gunshot leaves reverberations throughout the world, interfering with the lives of many people who at first glance are seemingly unrelated. These two men, director and writer respectively, have crafted two previous masterpieces with themes of love and sorrow, pain and redemption. From Amores Perros and 21 Grams, we are shown a steady progression of style and scale. While many are on the fence about Iñárritu's quality as an auteur being that Arriaga has written each of his directorial efforts, (while having success on his own, writing the wonderful Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada for Tommy Lee Jones), I believe they will have to take notice with this brilliant tale. Yes, the script is top-notcha pitch-perfect use of verbal economyhowever, the visual style has finally stepped up to the plate here as the director took control and beautifully orchestrated scenes, effectively disarming the audience on a totally visceral level. It may not be the team's finest, the scale might have stretched them a bit thin, however, the emotions are epic and the story lines true, once again creating what could be the best film of the year.We live in a world split into different ways of life. Our cultures can seem behind the times to others or too advanced for their own good to more. Babel helps show us the many details that go into the everyday lives of Moroccans, Mexicans, Japanese, and Americans abroad. As with his previous films, Iñárritu shoots close up and kinetically. We see the food sticking to the Moroccan family's fingers as they eat from a community bowl, the sweat forming from the sweltering Mexican heat, and the bright lights and sterile feel to a Japanese city along with its rambunctious youth culture raving behind the curtains. Through all the differences, though, this tale shows us the common thread of humanity which lies deep down in us all, proving that no matter our ethnicity or language, we are all here to live amongst each other as men and women.Iñárritu and Arriaga have given us inventive story structure in the past by allowing us to see instances multiple times, from different vantage points. Amores Perros told three stories that were connected by an event shown from each story's arc and 21 Grams jumped through time to show the interconnecting of its' three characters' lives. With Babel it appears as though he has gone with a straightforward narrative until we finally get the reveal of when each story takes place in relation to the others. While only necessary in a logistical capacity rather than a stylistic choice, the abandoning of the ""gimmick"", for lack of a better term, frees him to wow us in other ways. What he chooses to do instead is barrage our eyes with powerful moments of acting without words. Like on his previous films, the score enhances moments in between the action enormously with loud strings and other orchestral instruments superimposed on the silent moments depicted on screen. Because of the many languages, Iñárritu is free to use this technique often as actions speak louder than words. We are led through the story by sight and sound without the use of language to guide us. Emotions are humanity's common ground in terms of understanding and Babel uses them as a language in and of itself.The utter silence is a main factor to the phenomenal performances across the board. Actors aren't screaming or posing for the cameras, but instead softly trying to make it through the hardships of life. Cate Blanchett is great in a role where body language is key and along with Brad Pitt, (finally being given the chance to show he is more than just a fast-talking leading man type, but also a talented actorone could say his own fault especially after leaving a passion project of Darren Aronofsky's caliber for the great failure that was Troy, thankfully Hugh Jackman saved the day and four years later The Fountain will finally be released in a couple of weeksbut I digress), shows the pain of loss and that of love when your future is uncertain. Pitt is a revelation and does his best work since his off-the-wall role in 12 Monkeys, playing the exact opposite here, a fallen man, subtle and nuanced to perfection. Playing one of the Moroccan boys, Boubker Ait El Caid is immensely talented for a young kid, taking his character from a child to a man in mere hours of storyline. The evolution is true to form and the way he shows how his fear drives his actions is remarkable. Rinko Kikuchi is amazing, showing a range of emotions that run the gamut, all while being deaf to the world. Her isolation from life itself and how she thinks she needs to act in order to overcome it is heartrenching. Credit Iñárritu for his help in getting her feelings across, especially in the fantastic nightclub scene with all the lights, projections, and sound filling the air yet cutting abruptly to silence as we are shown what confusion really is for this girl, who can't fully enjoy or understand the actions of those dancing around her. All the actors in the Mexican sub- story do great work as well with cameos from the always-reliable Clifton Collins Jr., Michael Peña, and Gael Garcia Bernal. However, the star here is Adriana Barraza and the evolution her character takes. From the helplessness of possibly missing her son's wedding, to the joy of seeing that moment, to the responsibility of needing to get the children back, to the utter loss of all conscious thought as she must protect the children from the mistakes she has unknowingly made.",Babel
92,vitaleralphlouis,"A Beautiful, Engrossing Movie - One of 2006's Two Best Films.",9,24 March 2007,"Please forget about any intellectual pretense or high handed moralizing, as BABEL has neither. Instead we get three (3) ever-so-slightly interconnected stories of people in desperate circumstance, for different reasons; all three stories being very compelling --- as well as brilliantly acted and photographed in three fascinating locations (Morocco, San Diego, Tokyo). Rarely anymore do we find pictures which are targeted for the adult mind (persons over 15); so here we have the exception.I believe this film suffered severely at the box office --- ticket sales were truly lame --- as a backlash from the public's resentment having seen 2005's alleged best picture CRASH, a piece of pseudo-intellectual junk which presumed a heavy handed moralizing --- as if anyone in Hollywood has morals which anyone else wants. Unfortunately BABEL in its concept of interrelated stories sounded like CRASH II --- but in fact the films are as different as rat poison (CRASH) and fine wine (BABEL). I strongly recommend this movie for anyone.",Babel
93,fwomp,Lack of Languages Gets Deadly,8,23 February 2007,"Communication is vital to human survival; be it diplomatic, within family units, or at border crossings. There are tons of examples of deadly ends that have resulted due to miscommunication. And this is the premise for BABEL, a film winning (and probably destined to win) many movie awards. Although I think this is fine, I do think it a tad unfair for a couple of reasons.First is that comedies are often pushed aside at these award shows in favor of dramatic roles. I point this out because this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE shone brightly with many award nominations but won too few. Comedic timing is probably one of the toughest achievements when it comes to script and acting, and to simply pass them by is the biggest shame in my estimation. Which brings us to Babel...Although thought-provoking and interesting, Babel isn't the monolithic film accomplishment I was expecting. After its multiple wins at Cannes and its Golden Globe pick-up for Best Picture, I was expecting a righteously perfect film. I did get a good film, an enjoyable one. But legendary? Above Little Miss Sunshine? I don't think so.Stories are about people, and Babel has that and a bit more. Perhaps too much more. Similar to CRASH in composition, Babel tells its story via a triad. The first is through the eyes of Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), a married American couple on holiday in Morocco. Well, not really a holiday. They are there to try and save their marriage after the SIDS death of an infant son. Both feel equal amounts of guilt and blame toward the other. While driving in a vacation bus with other tourists, Susan gets hit by a bullet fired from a hillside by a ten-year-old Moroccan kid and his elder brother. Richard, forced into the role of a caring husband, must now try and save his wife's life while in the middle of nowhere and with limited communication skills in this foreign land.The second part of the triad takes place in Southern California and concerns Richard and Susan's two surviving children as they await the return of their parents from overseas. Amelia (Adriana Barraza), an illegal Mexican immigrant, watches over their kids and needs to go to a wedding in Mexico. Unable to find another babysitter for them, she reluctantly crosses into Mexico with the kids thanks to her cousin Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal, THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP), a reckless man with a short fuse temper. Once in Mexico, everything goes fine. The wedding is beautiful and original in appearance. But crossing back over the border into the U.S. presents some nearly fatal results.The third and final part of the triad involves a deaf-mute Japanese teenager named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi). Battling with her mother's recent suicide and her own growing sexuality, Chieko struggles to be understood in a world that's alive with sounds she'll never hear nor understand. Her father was also a great big game hunter and once gave a nice, new rifle to one of his guides as thanks for a successful hunt; the same gun used to shoot Susan in Morocco.There's a fourth leg to this story, too (not really a triad now, is it), in that the Moroccan boys and their family are unfortunately involved in the shooting of the American through their own foolishness and the illegal obtaining of a high-powered rifle (which was supposed to be used to kill jackals that eat their goat herd).The big problem with the entire story is that it's built on such a grand scale that it just can't stand up under its own, great weight ...especially when comparing it to something like Little Miss Sunshine (which got the audience VERY intimate with its characters). That's not to say that Babel isn't watchable or even good. It is both. I'm glad I saw it. But on par with Little Miss Sunshine and the like? I don't think so.",Babel
94,jon.h.ochiai,Common Thread,9,24 February 2007,"""Babel"" may be the year's best, although not entirely original. Director and Writer Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and co-writer Guillermo Arriaga's ""Babel"" links four seemingly independent stories together through a common thread. This is not unlike Paul Haggis's ""Crash""; however, ""Crash"" did so with a cohesive and compelling narrative that is interwoven in the stories' tapestry. Although not as eloquent, ""Babel"" generates powerful images with uneven results. Not all the stories in ""Babel"" are equally compelling or complete. The one storyline involving the Nanny (Adriana Barazza) and the two kids lost in Mexico is the most contrived and most tangential. Inarritu elicits a powerful performance from Brad Pitt (who surprisingly did not receive a Supporting Actor nomination), and an electrifying breakthrough performance from Rinko Kikuchi, who plays an angst ridden Japanese deaf mute girl. ""Babel"" may be flawed in spots, but the movie stands as bold and ambitious work by Inarritu. In ""Babel"" the world comes full circle with its resolution left to the audience. What ""Babel"" sometimes lacks in terms of eloquence and coherence, are balanced by powerful and riveting images.Mike (Brad Pitt) and his wife Susan (Cate Blanchett) are a troubled couple vacationing in Morocco. Susan is seriously wounded when two boys shoot a rifle at their tour bus. The rifle indirectly came from a Japanese huntera somewhat convoluted origin. Stranded in the middle of nowhere Mike calls his housekeeper Amelia (Barraza) back in the States, so he can speak to his two children, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble). In a bizarre twist Amelia decides to take the children to Mexico for her son's wedding. In Japan we meet renegade volleyball player Chieko (Kikuchi). Chieko is a deaf mute teenager filled with rage and precariously emerging into her own sexuality. Chieko is estranged from he father (Koji Yakusho), and suffering from the suicide of her mother. She is also indulging in the world of drugs and alcohol on the underground club scene.Outwardly, Chieko's story seems the most detached and irrelevant. Here Inarritu creates surprise and poignancy. Rinko Kikuchi gives a shockingly raw and vulnerable performance as Chieko that elevates ""Babel"". Kikuchi's Chieko is the broken aftermath of tragedy and perceived powerlessness. This again ties back to Brad Pitt's Mike, who desperately fights to keep his wife Susan (Blanchett) alive in midst chaos. Perhaps, that is one of the points of Inarritu's ""Babel"": We all must deal with the consequences of our own actions, and more importantly the actions of those close to us. It is unclear and unpredictable regarding life's outcome. The solace that we have is that life will work out, the way it does. This is the strength of ""Babel"" that makes for compelling and powerful viewing.",Babel

In Tokyo, a deaf-mute teenage girl (Rinko Kikuchi) is falling apart in the wake of her mother's suicide.The film is a wildly ambitious epic, conceived on a global scale. Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu takes global interdependence as his theme, and sets his stories in contrasting cultures. The links between them gradually become clear, and each location yields memorable images. Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga eloquently plead a case for more understanding and empathy.

97,gregsrants,So-So,5,13 November 2006,"Being familiar with the Biblical story of Babel will do nothing to aide in your understanding and appreciation for the new Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams) film, Babel. In the film, we follow three separate stories in three separate languages that all have a common connection.The first story follows two American tourists in Morocco (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett). As Richard and Susan, this married couple are taking a vacation from their San Diego home and two children in an attempt to find forgiveness and redemption after the death of their son. But, while taking a bus ride through the mountains, Susan is accidentally shot through the bus window by a sharp shooting young child who is playing with the gun his father gave him to shoot jackals from the family's goat herd. The incident sets off an international firestorm with worldwide media reporting the shooting as an act of terrorism against the United States. As the manhunt intensifies for the shooters, Susan struggles in a nearby village to survive while the American Embassy works to provide her medical support.In a separate story, the children of Richard and Susan are left in the care of their illegal housekeeper. With the couple still in Morocco, they are taken to Mexico for the evening so that the maid could attend her son's wedding. Their reentry into the United States leads to complications and the housekeeper and children find themselves stranded in the desert in a desperate attempt to find help.And in the third story, a Japanese deaf-mute schoolgirl yearns for acceptance from both her father and the men around her that seem uninterested in her budding sexuality. Her bustling hormones lead her down a slippery path that has the young pubescent trying desperately to use her body in an attempt to find the affections of a man.Got it? Good. Babel is truly a film about language and communication. As Richard and Susan are struggling with the Moroccans to get them to understand their situation, there are also fighting with other members of the tour bus that want driven back to safety and with their own government who is cutting red tape (due to communication) in an effort to send air support. Communication is also at the heart of the story of the two children and the housekeeper. As the border patrol does not give the adult and her nephew the opportunity to explain their intentions, they run from the law and their actions have life altering results. But maybe most interesting is how the story of the deaf-mute schoolgirl and her inability to communicate relates to the story of Babel. Unable to express herself in words, she utilizes her naked body in an effort to seek the attention she so desires. If the Biblical story of Babel chronicles how without communication, we are destined to fail, this story personifies the point to the greatest exponent. Who would have thought that the story of someone who cannot talk would teach us so much about how poorly we communicate as a civilization.Unfortunately, Babel is yet another exercise of non-linear storytelling. We go from story to story transcending time in a tired formula that strains the limits of patience in their particular effort. Just as we begin to relate and have any emotional attachment to Susan and Richard, we are quickly shuffled to Japan where we can only strain to relate to the young schoolgirl only to be shuffled to Mexico, then back to Japan, then.well, you get the point. We go in and out of each story without the investment of any emotional time necessary to drive home feelings towards any of the characters' plights. This translates into there being no payoff by the time the film finally concludes.This then takes Babel from a prematurely touted Oscar contender to simply a good film that cannot hold the weight of Alejandro González Iñárritu's two previous efforts. Although the acting is fine and the stories on their own are interesting and intriguing, together they just didn't have the Krazy Glue necessary to keep the attention span of the average movie-goer. I consistently looked at my watch during the screening and as lives were held in the balance of the film's running time, I just didn't care enough to become 'moved' by any of the character's outcomes.By no means does this mean a complete failure by the director. By the time his career is over, I would hope that I could give this film another shot as part of a Director's compilation DVD set, but until then, I am still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and for a movie that is all about communication, I just don't seem to want to recommend it to anyone. www.robertsreviews.com",Babel

It takes 3 seemingly unrelated stories and weaves them together in such a masterful way, in such a compelling way, to where you find yourself deeply invested emotionally in these peoples' situations without actually realizing when you begin caring - it's done so seamlessly, it just 'creeps up' on you, subtly and organically.The film is not just ambitious for the sake of being ambitious, either. (And it is exceedingly ambitious, with the 3 stories taking place all over the map.) There is genuine depth here, real characters in all their humanity, and the ultimate achievement is indeed on the purest human level. There's an astounding amount of political subtext going on - some stated, some implied, some even more subtly inferred - but the film, in the end, is not about any of it. It's the human element that's at the core of this masterpiece - it's as humans, after all, that we are connected, regardless of our cultural, race, class and/or intellectual differences.

I suppose that the idea has been thought of before - that communication leads to and solves problems, even the film's titular Biblical reference is about that - but rarely has it been presented in such a way as this. The film is right on about portraying a very worldwide problem the way it should be seen - through human eyes and not just one set, but many. The film's design is also terrific with each setting being thoroughly developed as its own place through music, mood, and of course, spoken language.Inarritu and Arriaga, who made '21 Grams' together, have taken that idea and expanded into something truly great. ""Babel' is not just a tight, well acted drama that '21 Grams' was, but also a poignant look at the worldwide spectrum. --- 9/10Rated R for violence and mature themes",Babel
101,jpschapira,"The Question, Part 2",10,5 February 2007,"I don't know where to start hereI'm speechless as I was one hour ago, when ""Babel"" came to an end in the big screen. I haven't been so moved by a film, so captivated by a screenplay since ""Crash"" last year. When I wrote about ""Crash"", I said: 'This is the type of movie we talk about infinitely'; the same goes for ""Babel"". Alejandro González Iñárritu's picture tells a story that connects three different places, showing three different cultures and a lot of different characters.As with ""21 Grams"", where three persons who didn't know each other ended up being connected; the director and his right hand, writer Guillermo Arriaga, plot an accident that unites everything. Also here, the title could have a small or a big connection with the movie itself, depending on how much you want to analyze it; because one thing's for sure: Iñárritu works for the people, and that you can analyze it too.Recently, I read an interview with Brad Pitt (by the way, his performance is excellent; quiet, human, inspiring), and he talked about ""Babel"". About how unknown he was as a celebrity in the place where they were shooting, about how great he thought the two little kids (Boubker Ait El Caid and Said Tarchani) who play brothers were as actors, about the pleasure of working with Cate Blanchett and about how, nowadays we've got the best ways to generate communication; but we don't use them. ""We should be able to understand ourselves better, but there's a big lack of comprehension"", he cited.""Listen"", says the film's tagline here in Argentina. If Arriaga took his screenplay to Tokyo is because he's in a desperate need of ears. So he created a deaf-mute character (a Japanese teenager played brilliantly by Rinko Kikuchi) that gave Iñárritu the chance of silencing the picture completely during certain scenes where we get this girl's vision of the world; and she wants to talk so bad, she wants to say lots of things.Both of them, writer and director have a transparent vision and a big amount of knowledge about the topics they present. When Amelia (a committed Mexican Actress named Adriana Barraza) and her nephew (Gael García Bernal) are crossing the border with two American kids, consequences can't always be good. As Mexicans, the duo is more than perfect to generate this environment. The music sure helped the environment. Gustavo Santaolalla must have taken a good advice and an even better source of inspiration; because his score captures the mood of each scene with his touching guitars and a heartbreaking piano & strings.Arriaga's script gives each of the stories its own timeline. At first, you may see it as lame; but it was the right move to playI can't remember being so preoccupied by fictional characters I barely knew before. This is the effect the movie has on the viewer, almost unwillingly. ""Babel"" is about communication, about egoism and prejudice, about differences between those who are different, but also between compatriots; and that's why I find it ironic that the Academy praised the film and nominated it for the major prize, when it exposes an ugly side of their own society.""Babel"" is great film-making that contains a great message (something we rarely see these days), but a message that's not spoken; a message you find within the images. Even soIs ""Babel"" the Best Picture Oscar of the year?",Babel
102,gelman@attglobal.net,"Overlapping stories, some loose ends",8,1 July 2007,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS""Babel"" is a daring film with stories that overlap and clash, remaining partly unresolved at the conclusion. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are the name stars and their story is at the center of the film with the others evolving around it. Susan (Cate's character) is on a trip to Morocco with her husband, Richard (Pitt's character). She is seriously wounded when a couple of kids fire a newly acquired hunting rifle at the tour bus Susan and Richard are riding on.Stranded in a remote village and hemorrhaging, Susan is treated initially by a veterinarian. They are soon abandoned by their traveling companions but not by the tour guide who remains with them in his village to do what he can. Richard desperately seeks to summon assistance, eventually provided by a medical helicopter dispatched from Casablanca through the American Embassy. Susan is rushed into the emergency room; a doctor emerges to tell Richard that she urgently requires serious surgery to eliminate blood clots and may lose an arm; we eventually learn, via a television news clip, that she has lived and been released from the hospital. We are never told how fully she recovered or even whether she lost the arm.The second story is that of the Moroccan family that buys the hunting rifle from a neighbor to kill predators that threaten their goat herd. Their younger son fires the shot that all but kills Susan. When the police find the father and his two sons, a fire fight ensues during which the younger son hits a policeman and the older son is killed. The least satisfying part of the entire film is the fire fight. The police simply begin shooting without trying to negotiate a surrender. A third story -- the most puzzling until the very end -- takes place in Japan. The principal character is a deaf mute teenager whose mother has killed herself, for which she blames her wealthy father. The girl roams Tokyo with her friends, actively seeking sex. An important segment of this story takes place in a nightclub in vivid, whirling colors and noisy music (which frequently disappears into absolute silence). When she ultimately returns home, she summons a handsome young detective who wants to question her father to their sumptuous apartment high above the city. At one point, she undresses completely, inviting him urgently to have sex with her. He rejects her advances but tries to comfort her. It is only then that we discover the connection between this story and the others: The police are not investigating her mother's suicide but want to ask the father whether he gave the hunting rifle used to shoot Susan to his Moroccan guide, as the guide has claimed. (He confirms that he did.) At the very end of this tale, the father discovers his daughter standing stark naked on the apartment balcony overlooking the city and puts his arm around her. The fourth story features the Mexican nanny whom Richard and Susan have left with their two young children, a boy and a girl, while they went overseas. The Mexican nanny crosses the border into Mexico from San Diego, taking the children because she can find no one to leave them with. She is traveling with her irresponsible nephew to her son's wedding. The nephew drinks a great deal during the celebration. On the way back, they are stopped at the border. Suspecting that the nephew is drunk, a border guard orders him to move his car and then get out from behind the wheel. Panicking, the nephew smashes his car into another, then takes off at high speed, chased by a police posse. Turning off the road, he tells his aunt to wait in the desert with the two children. When he doesn't return, the aunt tries to walk out with the kids, not knowing where she is. Because she can't continue to carry the girl, she eventually parks the kids in the partial shade provided by a scrubby bush while she continues on foot seeking help. She finally flags down a border patrol car and is immediately arrested, suspected of trying to cross into the U.S. illegally. The officer believes enough of her story to summon help to save the children but the nanny will be deported. The stories are inter-leaved and in several places events are depicted out of the order in which they occurred. But the viewer is able to sort out the time sequences eventually, and to arrive at the destination planned all along by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the director, and Guillermo Arriaga who both conceived the idea and wrote the script.The film is, for the most part, well executed. The languages -- English, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, and Japanese sign language -- allow for much mutual incomprehension, hence the title. But the message is both the randomness and the interconnectedness of life on Earth. Though (deliberately) obscure in part, the moral is transparent.Pitt and Blanchett are splendid as are many of the other actors whose names were not recognizable to me. However, now that I know the names of the director and script-writer, I will be looking for other films they make.",Babel
103,RResende,(Un) communication,8,14 January 2007,"(Un) communicationCinema, like every other art, is communication. Everything that comes through moving image (or not), with or without sound, is pure communication. Whether you want it or not, whether the artist deny t or not, everything that shows communicates something. The art touch is in controlling what it's being communicated. So, ""Babel"" chooses eventually the hardest theme to be worked out by any artistic medium: that of the non-communication. Everything that Iñarritu pretends is to show the absence of communication, and its effects, to put us in a dark hole together with his characters, with whom we all identify a little bit. I believe this picture to be as contemporary as contemporary can be. And i'll explain: Portuguese director João Botelho once said that the temptation of telling a story is the original sin of cinema, the idea that a film is worth by the succession of facts, narrative, climax and conclusion. Contemporary cinema (as other arts), in its will to move along, is, as a consequence, in a certain state of crisis, trying to get redefined and move forward. Somehow like the world in Babel. Complex, fascinating, but somehow unruled. Iñarritu rejects the story for the story, the linear narrative as a pretext for ""hanging"" some images. He moves away from ""fact"", working on the image (and what image, the photography is fantastic) and on the context, as a medium to communicate. He wasn't for sure the first to try it, but he's one of the best doing it, in a mainstream context and consistently. In the same way he is contemporary in the self-referential way in which he approaches the art of film-making itself. This one, like ""Amores perros"" or ""21 grams"" is itself a research on the narrative building and cinema. So, a film about other films, and a film about cinema(possible spoilers)Here, once more, as in the rest of the trilogy, the non linear narrative is used, by the over layering of stories that connect at some point. It works here as 4 short stories, which are edited and viewed in excerpts, with a specific order. Each story is clear and easy to get, if analysed without the link to the others. The order of the excerpts is always:1-morocan kids 2-the Mexican babysitter and the American children 3-the Americans in Morocco 4-the Japanese storyThis order repeats constantly but the chronology within each one isn't synchronized. So, story 1 begins at the end of story 2, which develops in parallel with story 3. Story 4 is more free in terms of time attachment, but some things show that it should happen approximately in parallel with the previous 2 stories.All the construction, which is rather intelligent, reflects the extreme simplicity of the world it pretends to show, carrying the idea of a new order of values replacing the existing one, the order of mankind replacing the primitive order of nature (the ""storytelling"" being replaced by complexity in narrative, the spontaneous vs the cerebral). So, it talks about the idea of the individual dominated by a complex system, which, however, everybody helped creating. And the title of the picture gets justified here: the biblical metaphor for the creation of the languages showed the punishment of the growing vanity. Here it shows the inability to communicate as the motivation to violence and fights between people.Practically every event (bad event) that take place happen as a consequence of failure in communication. The inability to get ideas through goes beyond the ignorance of the languages, causes the isolation of the individual in the global context. And what Iñarritu does is to treat this cinematically. The Japanese girl is deaf-mute (not by chance) and that allows in her scenes to place the camera inside and outside her viewing point, as deaf and mute, either in the absence of communication/reception or in what is not communicated. The scene in the disco is absolutely remarkable in that point. The work of the camera is, by the way, remarkable in every scene concerning the Japanese girl. when she waits for the elevator, back to the policemen, and the spectator gets the whole picture. Than she turns and the spectator becomes her. This is truly cinematic.My evaluation: 4/5 fascinating experience (together with the other from the trilogy)",Babel
104,barryrd,Babel fails to deliver,5,9 April 2007,"There were too many layers in this complicated plot, leaving the viewer jerking along from one location to another with no sense of where this movie is headed. This is not to say that the story lacks suspense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat but much of the time the viewer is just hoping to tie the strands together. It takes the entire movie to put the final puzzle into the storyline; however, the connection is so tenuous as to be almost non-existent. This movie is full of good intentions but it only delivers sadness, not a message about the human condition. Let it be said, that we cheer more for the underdogs in the film than for the unsympathetic San Diego couple who get caught up in an international incident. The end to this movie is not very satisfying and we are trying to sort out where it went wrong. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a talented director, this film didn't connect with me.",Babel
105,oneloveall,Breadth of vision compromised by dogmatic techniques,7,8 November 2006,"Anyone familiar with the starkly serious duo, Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga already knows that to expect a powerhouse drama of far reaching proportions is to expect the norm. Capping off the final installation from the trilogy that brought us Amores Perros and 21 Grams, Babel is anything if predictable in tone, pace and style for those already familiar with these important, though perhaps receding artists. Although this film demonstrates nearly all of the key elements that helped put their work near the top of the human drama form, the third installation becomes slightly weighed down by the narrative structure the former films made better use of. Continuing the trademark of a gritty three story approach, Babel interweaves another painfully resonant trio of stories that explore a whole range of human emotions, spanning, this time, a whole range of the globe. Ironically, as the material has been stretched to fill out a more cohesive, world-wide dialog of pain, love, and redemption, the script comes off as being a tad more convoluted then in the past. While two of the three interweaving narratives completely relate to each other, the third plot line feels almost superficially connected. What adds up is perhaps not the sweeping masterpiece that fans had hoped for, but still a worthy validation in some of the most heartfelt, sincere individual scenes of the year. If anything, Iñárritu proves his talent for atmosphere is second to none in our market, aided by outstanding musical scoring to compliment one of modern cinemas most sensitive filmmakers.",Babel
106,jdkraus,A powerful taste of reality and stupidity...,10,11 November 2006,"I saw this on a screening on opening day, having no clue as to what to expect in this film. Me, I have never seen an Iñárritu film before, and I was totally captivated by this film. People may criticize that this is another Crash and to some degree it is true. But this film is different because it depicts the lives and emotions of people worldwide and how each lifestyle and individual(s) are different, but also similar.The film follows four families, four stories, over three continents. The opening is with a Morocco family that receives a rifle for protection of their goats. But when the two sons play around with it, they fire a shot, that can be heard around the world. the director follows their troubles and struggles which leads them into a very shocking and violent conclusion that left me in near tears.Their victim is an American tourist Susan Jones (Cate Blanchett), and her desperate husband Richard Jones (brad Pitt), does everything he can to save her life before she dies. They may start out as the basic average American couple: argumentative, selfish, and on a downslope of a marriage, but with this incident, it brings them closer and to realizing that all they really have is their love. The director captures this very explicitly, making you, the audience feel for them, which is one of many emotional standpoints in the film.Menawhile in Japan, a teenage girl, named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) who is a deaf-mute suffers from loneliness and is rejected by everyone else because of her disability. She decides to impress those around her by doing the typical teenage activities such as: drinking, drugs, and inappropriate sexual content. For me, this was the best story in the whole film, and the director, again, captures the girl's emotions very powerfully.Especially in a dance room sequence where she goes with her friends, and it shows it with the exotic dancing, blaring noise, and flashing lights, but then the director would pull to her viewpoint which edits the sound out, and makes everything look like a chaotic mess. This reveals very clearly her point of view of life. i also have to add that Rinko gave an outstanding performance and Chieko, which should make Zhang Ziyi or Koyuki flush with envy.The last story is about the nanny of the Jones' family, Amelia, is her name, (Arianna Barraza) who is called to watch over their two kids. Since she has a son who is about to be married in Mexico, she decides to take them with her to the wedding (a huge mistake). The director, yet again, captures this story with a realistic feeling of Hispanic heritage and music (which the director can relate to), that made this story easy to grasp. However, when she returns to the border with her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) and faces severe consequences with the patrol guards.Each story is crafted with art and beauty and makes you feel inside the film, with these characters, who face their troubles, which leads to either disaster or, success or stupidity. The film was gripping and I have to reapet myself, I was captivated by it. the cinematography by Rodrigo Pietro was excellent, the score fit the characters' and films' emotions, the editing was not choppy, but organized, the, acting was intense, and above all, the director gave a realistic view of the destinations of the film, from the colorful Tokyo, Japan to the rocky deserts of Morocco. It was all tastefully done.I have to say though, a lot of content in this film was over te top. The director was unafraid to show graphic violence and vivid sexual content. But this is not a negative factor for the film, for it depicts reality and human stupidity, which leads to consequence. There is no doubt that this film would get Oscar recognition.**** out of ****",Babel
107,FloatingOpera7,"Babel, Our Current Modern World",10,7 December 2006,"Babel (2006): Starring Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Koji Yakusho, Rinko Kikuchi, Boubker Ait El Caid, Said Tarchani, Mustapha Rachidi, Adriana Barraza, Elle Fanning, Nathan Gabmel, Gael Garcia Bernal, Mohamed Akhzam, Peter Wight, Harriet Walter, Trevor Martin, Matyelok Gibbs, Georges Bousquet, Claudine Acs, Dermot Crowley, Michael Maloney, Mohammed Benanni, Barbarella Pardo, Ursula Garcia, Ran Saotome, Kumi Okawatsu, Hirotaka Nabeya, Koji Yoshida, Shigemitsu Ogi, Fernandez Mattos Dolce, Akira Matsuda....Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Screenplay Guillermo Arriaga.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is best known for his satiric ""Amores Perros"". ""Babel"" is his attempt at a far more serious drama. The result is a disturbing, dismal reminder of today's sad reality, all this conveyed without much action or traditional Oscar-loved drama. This long, dark, dreary visual film mirrors today's current world condition. The title alludes to the legendary Biblical city of Babel, where according to Genesis, all the languages of the world originated after a defiant nation attempted to build a tower to Heaven, provoking the wrath of God. Director Inarritu uses this story as a metaphor for the society we live in today. I, for one, agree. Living in Southern California I see a large number of different cultures and languages, from Asian, Hispanic, white, black, Middle Eastern, Native American, etc and despite living in relatively close circumference, they seem to be living in different planets and do not get along as well as they should. On a conceptual level, this film seems over-the-top and unrealistic despite the realistic elements all over it. Two desert-dwelling children from the north African country of Morocco accidentally cause the injury of an American tourist Susan (Cate Blanchett) on a let's save our marriage vacation with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt). Cate Blanchett is doing nothing special. Throughout the film she bleeds, cries and nearly dies. Brad Pitt grieves and suffers her pain second-hand but does not do any real acting as well. On the other hand, the other no-name actors do more acting. The gun that triggers the tourist's injury was owned by a Japanese businessman in Tokyo, whose wife committed suicide and left him with a sexually frustrated, disturbed young deaf-mute daughter. While Richard and Susan cope with trying to get medical help and rescue from the Embassy, their children find themselves in another tight spot. Their Mexican nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza), desperate to see her son's wedding south of the border in Mexico, takes the children along. But on their way back to the States, she finds herself in trouble when her brother Santiago defies border patrol and abandons them in the desert. The two Morrocan children and their father, the Abdullah, face dire consequences when investigators discover they are responsible for the tourist's injury. It may appear that all this uproar is caused by the ""news-making"" incident of an American tourist's death (if she were an ethnic tourist she wouldn't make the news!), the film suggests the hopelessness of today's world that cannot cope with the big differences in language and culture. The world is drifting apart and not making a tower to Heaven, that is, building a better future through progress. If you miss that message, then you do not get the point of the film. Babel is a very long and at times brutal torture-film. Some things I found absolutely irrelevant, such as the sexual aspects of the characters of Yussef who fired the shot and the Japanese girl Chieko. But this film is powerful, spellbinding and extremely emotional. It is sadly, a film that most critics will not receive well. Cate and Brad decided to do this ""social commentary"" film than the fantasy romance ""The Fountain"".",Babel
108,RJBurke1942,It's the things we do that often cause our kids grief; it's the things we should do that make the difference.,8,9 June 2007,"From reading a selection of reviews here, it's obvious this film causes much disagreement and for various reasons: too long, too pretentious, too dense, too obscure, too fractured and basically about how people fail to communicate. Thematically, however, I see a different path.This is the third film from director Inarritu about connectedness, and lack thereof, between disparate people in the community of this world. In a sense, the director and writer (Arriaga) perhaps took the loose idea of six-degrees of separation seriously (and that has some merit) and interpose an example of the butterfly effect upon the lives of three sets of people when one person starts the ball rolling, so to speak. Next time you're at the bowling alley, you can think about that as you watch the pins fall.The title of this film, no doubt, pays homage to the biblical story about the tower of Babel; and this story has plenty of instances of people miscommunicating and misunderstanding each other. But, it's the sub-text of this narrative that is far more compelling for me (simply because a movie about how people don't communicate is not very original) because it's all about how kids get into trouble when ignored or neglected by their parents or minders ... all over the world.So, from my perspective, that's the theme that counts here and why the film was made. So, parents take note: in a sense, something like this could happen to your kids, wherever you are. The film, however, is a departure for the director, in the sense that the narrative is not as fractured as that for 21 Grams (2003) or Amores Perros (2000); for those, the viewer had more work to do to keep up with the editing and sequencing of past, present and future. So, on that basis, I enjoyed this film more than the other two.So, who starts the ball rolling? Well, like the other movies above, we come into the story long after that happened: there is a married couple (Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett) in Morocco, trying to save their marriage; there are their children in San Diego being cared for by their Mexican housemaid; there's a goat herder with two sons in the desolate mountains of Morocco; and, there's a Japanese business man in Tokyo who's trying to save his relationship with his teenage daughter. How that metaphorical rolling ball hits all those people demonstrates how well narrative coincidence can be used to very good effect. I can't think of one instance where this narrative should cause any cries of disbelief: coincidence does occur in everyday life. In fact, I'd argue that coincidence occurs more often and more bizarrely than we really know. But showing how that can happen takes time and, at 143 minutes, you might think the film too long, as I said; but I can assure you that every frame is worth your time.The cinematography is simply great, as is the editing - as you might expect from an Inarritu movie. The music is stunning and worthy of the Academy Award it won. The acting is superb, with particular kudos for all of the children who, I think, are on camera as much as or more than the adults. And, rightly so, because this is a story about the vulnerability of children, which is emphasized over and over by Susan (Cate Blanchett) as she pleads with Richard (Brad Pitt) to look after the children, even as she lies bleeding to death -- having been hit by a stray bullet -- on the earthen floor of a hut in a remote Moroccan village, three hundred miles from the nearest hospital....Now, you might think that bullet is the metaphorical ball, but you'd be wrong. That ball starts rolling when one person makes a gift to another, months before.Hence, just how and why that bullet strikes Susan down, and what happens after, forms the core of this brilliant narrative. It would spoil the experience of seeing this film, for you, if I said anymore. You were once a kid, so see this movie if you can. If you're also a parent, I think you should see it. Scratch that: I think you must see it.Rated: 8/10. June 9, 2007",Babel
109,DonFishies,"Spellbinding, but marred by story problems",8,23 February 2007,"While I am not exactly sure why I did not bother seeing Babel when it first came to theatres, I do know that I kicked myself after it started picking up awards and nominations with some of the bigger critical societies. It looked good, but it also looked off. After the Oscar nominations were announced, I knew I had to make a point of finally seeing the film before the big night. And despite my excitement over finally seeing the movie, I am still a bit mixed in my feelings about it.Spanning four stories in four very different countries, Babel is connected by a single gun shot. In Morocco, Yusef (Boubker Ait El Caid) and Ahmed (Said Tarchani) have just been given a new rifle to help kill jackals praying on their families goats. In trying to understand the weapons firing capabilities, they innocently shoot at a tour bus. On that bus, American tourist Susan (Cate Blanchett) is hit by the bullet and injured. Her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) attempts to get help for her, while in America, their nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) is watching their kids, but wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico. Finally, in Japan, schoolgirl Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) wants attention from men, but unfortunately is a deaf mute.In a word, Babel is spellbinding. It is hard to take your eyes off of the screen at any moment during the film, and as it continues to go on, it only draws you in more and more. The global spanning story with the various languages is just a marvel to witness in action. But despite it being gorgeously photographed and brought to the screen, the film has a few issues that hold it back from being a true masterpiece.For one, the Japanese story just feels totally out of place. Whereas the other three stories are deeply interwoven within each other, allowing every scene to just flow into the next (in a totally non-linear sense), this story just kind of sits on the sidelines. Yes, it is connected to the greater story of the gun shot, but only by the loosest of threads. It is an interesting part of the complete story, but really, was there a better way to fill in the gaps between the other three stories? It has the most elaborate backgrounds in the film, the most music and undoubtedly the best performance, but it just feels awkward in the grand scheme of things.Another smaller issue is the time line. At times, it is a bit hard to follow how many days have progressed since the incident, and by the time you finally are told just how long it has been, it becomes a little ridiculous trying to think it all out. The non-linear story does not help much either.The story itself feels a little convoluted in sections. For the most part, I thought it was very well done, and very well brought to life on screen. But in a few instances, I sat in a bit of a daze, wondering whether they needed some of the extra sequences that they had. An early sequence in the Moroccan kid's story involves heavy sexual overtones. But later, they really do not rate anything more than a mention. A lot of the subplots like this just feel kind of tacked on, and never are really concluded as well as they should have been. Yes, I know that they have no real importance, but then why are they included here in the first place? They easily could have trimmed down the movie by a good handful of minutes by trimming some, if not all, of these subplots out. The movie's ultimate message and key story would still be in place, so I really do not understand why this could not have been done.The majority of the performances are all excellent. I was very impressed with El Caid and Tarchani as the Moroccan boys who set everything in motion. Their innocence and genuine fear are miraculously captured, and are so better done than the majority of child actors working today. Barraza also does very well for herself as the guilt-ridden nanny. As her story goes on, the desperation that plagues her is slowly let on, and the character slowly slips into just the right amount of panic. Just seeing how low this character gets is well worth her Oscar nomination. On the other hand, Pitt and Blanchett have both been much stronger in other films. Yes, they do more than an adequate job here (especially Pitt in his waning moments on screen), but I would be lying if I said that they have other entries in their bodies of work that far surpass this. Same goes for Gael Garcia Bernal, who like the subplots, just feels tacked on and not really developed as much of anything.Kukuchi is the real star power of this film. Her tragic performance of the deaf Japanese schoolgirl is simply astonishing. She really digs deep into this character, and the audience really gets a grand sense of the pain that these people go through every day. Just watching as she is socially rejected by everyone is just heart wrenching and so intense to watch. These scenes, needed or not, are gritty and bring a whole new sense to the film. I just wish that the filmmakers could have put her character in a much more useful position in the film.On the whole, Babel is flawed, but is a genuine experience to watch. Globalization has never been as key to a film as it is here. Despite its issues and lengthiness, you will be hard-set on taking your eyes off of the action taking place on screen. It is not perfect, but for what it sets out to do, it does more than an admirable job.8.5/10.",Babel

But the girl at the counter also told me that the money I pay for Babel ticket would be deducted from the membership fee and I only have to pay the balance once I come out after seeing the movie and apply for the membership.Babel - I read is a Bibilical story of the God's curse when God sees humans trying to build a tower to reach heaven. As a curse  the God curses man of speaking in several languages  so that they can not unite and ever build any tower to reach the heavens  the Gods.Babel is also a trilogy of a Mexican director  whose earlier two movies are well acclaimed internationally. I have not seen those movies  but reading the reviews of Babel  I understand that Babel is not the best of the director's movie.Babel tells 3 stories  one in Afghanistan, the other near Mexican border and the third one in Japan. All three stories are different but linked with each other.Briefly, a Japanese arms trader sells arms to Afghan people. The rifle that is given by the Afghani father to his son to protect cattle is used by the children as a play toy by shooting at the bus  that horrifically hits an American lady  who is traveling with her husband in Afghanistan, which delays their travel back home in America and leaves the house maid to take care of their children. The house maid is force to take the children across the border to Mexico for a wedding  as she can not leave them behind with any one.A Japanese story revolves around the arms trader's dumb daughter who is psychologically hungry for a boy to have sex with her. The Afghani story revolves around the American couple coping in a remote Afghan village among materialistic inhuman American co-passengers. The Mexican story is about the ordeal of the house maid who accidentally gets involve in a crossing border crime.All three stories are made in different languages  Japanese, Arabic and Mexican  Spanish, with Dutch sub-titles. Obviously, I do not know any of these languages. But still I enjoyed the movie.The movie brings about the small arms trade issue in the fore front crossing across continent  showcasing a link that involves totally independent characters in far fetched continents.I enjoyed the movie. Gladly it did not project Afghanistan and its people in negative way. The movie ended sad. The photography was excellent. The acting restrained! And good. I was glad to see Brad Pitt acting  choosing to act in such good scripted movies. Surely the script was the hero of this movie.",Babel
111,Imdbidia,We are all humans but speak in 1001 languages,8,12 February 2011,"An excellent movie made up of four intertwined stories all linked to the event with which the movie begins.The movie tell us of the harshness of life of different people of different cultures who are, despite their social, cultural and linguistic differences, very human. It also shows how the life of all humans, even of those that have nothing to do with us -at least initially- are interconnected.All actors do a great job in their respective roles, both the big movie stars and the not-so-well-known actors. On the other hand, this is one of the few movies in which Brad Pitt does not overact and where you feel that he believes and empathizes with the character he's playing, that is, where his acting serves perfectly to the story and not vice versa.I thought that, of the four stories, the one set in Tokyo, broke the tone of the movie emotionally, in style and in narrative; furthermore, the connection of the Japanese characters to the characters in the other stories is weaker than in the other three cases. Don't take me wrong, I thought that the Japanese story was excellent, even worthy of a whole movie, but,still, rested homogeneity to the film.I loved the fact that all actors speak their own language, without the director imposing English for the sake of the general public. That's not a surprise, of course, as Gonzalez Iñarritu is a Mexican who has shown that English is not needed for a movie to be universal and successful in touching themes that affect us all.",Babel
112,RossRivero99,A very intense masterpiece,10,7 November 2014,"Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's Babel is one of the best dramatic movies that I have seen in recent years, which tells the enthralling story of an unexpected and tragic accident in Morocco which is an accidental attempted murder which the person who was shot was a tourist named Susan (played by Cate Blanchett) whose attempted murder story interlocks coverage of four different families in order to find out how and why that accident in the first place. Also Brad Pitt who plays as Susan's husband Rick gives the sharpest performance of his career like never before because he gave excellent performances in Inglorious Basterds (2009), Burn After Reading (2008), Ocean's Eleven (2001), and Moneyball (2011). What Innaritu does with his direction for the movie to me is unprecedented because I have never seen a drama movie done so well since Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows (1959) I mean it was just so good, I was just speechless while watching it.",Babel
113,WriterDave,"Babel-on, Wayward Director...",6,6 November 2006,"With ""Babel"" Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has crafted the apex to his trilogy that began with the gangbusters ""Amores Perros,"" and continued with the finely crafted and haunting ""21 Grams."" Unfortunately, it seems that peak is crumbling. ""Babel"" has the same intertwining story structure as the previous two, but in hopping across continents and making the stories global (taking place in Mexico, Morrocco, and Japan), he loses some much needed focus. It also has what has now become his signature editing-with-a-hacksaw-style of chronology that worked beautifully in ""21 Grams"" but seems forced here. In fact there's one set of scenes taking place at a Mexican wedding that is needlessly incoherent in its jumping back and forth. Everything in this set of scenes is taking place at one location on one night, so why the jumbled chronology? It makes one wonder if they forgot an editor all together.""Babel"" is not without its merits. The story lines are more often than not thought-provoking and challenging. The ensemble acting is top notch from the big stars (Cate Blanchett is riveting as always in all her subtle and alluring ways and makes the most of her limited screen time) down to the no-name locals (the Morrocan kids being especially effective). There's also a commendable ambition to the whole endeavor as it attempts to explore communication and human emotion in the increasingly global and paradoxically intolerant world. Memorable, too, is some great cinematography of the Tokoyo skyline (especially that awesome closing pan-out from the high-rise balcony) and the Morrocan highlands, where the centerpiece of the intertwined tragedies takes place when an American tourist is accidentally shot by some goat-herding kids playing with a gun used to keep away jackals from their family's livelihood.Unfortunately ""Babel,"" in its uncompromising vision, plays out painfully in strained, awkward lurches that stretch believability. It's interesting how during various moments, different story lines seem the most compelling. The early scenes in Morocco of both the American couple (Blanchett and Brad Pitt) and the local goat-herders are stark and intimate and represent the best at what Inarritu is capable of as a storyteller. Later, he applies a humanistic touch to the scenes of the Mexican nanny taking her American charges across the border for her son's wedding. There's a wide-eyed innocent nature to the culture clash he depicts that gets garbled later when Gael Garcia Bernal (as the nanny's nephew) dives off the deep end with little reason and leads to a tragic series of events that really test the viewer's ability to take this all as seriously as the filmmaker's would like us to. Likewise, the Japanese tale of the deaf-mute teenage girl struggling to cope with society's unwillingness to communicate on her level, a distant father, and the recent suicide of her mother lurches forward so melodramatically it becomes banal, and the connection it has to the other stories is the biggest stretch to swallow, and most viewers will choke on it.Then, of course, there is the presence of the aforementioned uber-star Brad Pitt. He's at a point in his career where his celebrity status trumps his acting talent. He's actually quite good as Blanchett's frantic husband, but his star-power is distracting and constantly has the viewer thinking in the back of their mind ""wow, Brad Pitt can act"" rather than feeling anything for the character. This is a piece of stunt-casting that doesn't work.There are many compelling moments and noteworthy performances in ""Babel,"" but it crumbles under its own weight as just about everything is reduced to the big breakdown/crying scene, and we are left wondering what Inarritu will do next as a director. He's got talent to spare, but ran out of steam when taking his intimate look at human tragedy global with ""Babel.""",Babel
114,LazySod,Mildly disturbing,7,20 November 2006,"Babel tells the story of how a single event can drastically change the lives of a lot of people, living on various sides of the globe. In this case the events start with an accident with a rifle in the deserts of Morocco but the event could have been any, in any other place.The story starts slow and skips ahead and backward through time a lot, but it isn't hard to follow. Easy on the mind, if a little disturbing, it follows its own path as a slow mountain river but still manages to wash away the viewer in the end - the combination of happenings and mini-stories make for a very complete setting.Shots are worked out beautifully. From the deserts of Morocco to the busy city of Japan to the feast-full cities of Mexico. Each has a very unique taste and falls into place pretty well. Music is done well too and adds to the effect of the film.I couldn't keep myself from thinking of 21 Grams when I watching this film. A film made by the same directory, and personally I think a few degrees better than this one - it was more intense in many ways and it didn't have what I found a few times too many in this film: plot holes to bring points across or keep the story going.In conclusion: it isn't a bad film, not at all, but I can't call it a good film either. It misses a couple shots that would have made it into a great film, but all in all it leaves a firm impression. So, 7 out of 10 broken lives.",Babel
115,phenomynouss,"Terrible, awful, painful, completely irrelevant to the name and basis for the title ""Babel""",1,11 November 2006,"First off, this movie has nothing at all to do with the story of the Tower of Babel, or anything which the original trailer led me to believe it were about. No one had any problem communicating with anyone else---Brad Pitt's character had a helpful Muslim guy who spoke Morrocan Arabic and English, the Japanese girl knew sign language and could write, the Mexican nanny could speak English and Spanish, the Morrocan boys had no trouble speaking with anyone else in some other language.Now the movie itself. It got great reviews everywhere, but still I was ambivalent from this, due to my hatred of ""Crash""'s unrealistic, and blatantly pretentious view on ""racism"", and the constant comparisons between this and Crash.In my honest opinion, I think if the stories had been made out into separate short movies, all still connected, but in different segments, it could have worked out great, but all together like that, it was too painful to watch.First off, it's way too brutal. For seemingly no reason, the movie seems to grab you, rip at your heart, only to save you from breaking apart with a minor footnote that everything's going to be alright. Second, the stories are very loosely connected, some even completely disconnected---the Japanese girl (Chieko)'s story and Amelia's story have absolutely nothing to do with each other, or the shooting incident, save for the fact that Amelia is the nanny of BP and CB char's kids, and Chieko is the daughter of the man who originally owned the gun involved.Also, people looking to see ""Brad Pitt's best performance"" should know that at most, he gets probably 10-15 minutes of screen time. And even that amount is nothing more than looking somber, or looking a wreck because his wife is dying.All in all in all, I really don't understand how to categorize the movie, or how even to judge it properly, but this was one movie that made me depressed for all the wrong reasons... it was very heavy on raw emotion, for seemingly no purpose other than to hurt the audience's emotionsI don't understand why I hated it and thought it terrible, but I just do. Honestly, I believe you should go see it for yourself to truly judge. The other negative reviews are much better at explaining than I am.I have to repeat what I said above: If each individual story were separated from the big mash it was mushed into for ""Babel"", and made into separate little movies, or even TV movies, and released separately, but still connected, it could have worked, and worked great (aside from the brutal parts which would need a heavy editing job).",Babel
116,PIST-OFF,Good movie but I hate the leads,3,26 March 2021,"This is a well made movie and engaging but it's motivations are somewhat suspect because it's leads are absolutely the worst people. The movie is about interlocking families of international origin tied together by the centerpiece of the events of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. It is their characters that I loathe. Was the point of the movie to make people hate them? They are not good people. What kind of towering narcissism does it take to leave your very young children in the care of an illegal immigrant while you galavant trying to ""find yourself"" off the beaten path is some third world country? A decision of that magnitude of stupidity ruins the whole movie for me and I can't help but think that every bad thing that happens to them in the movie they deserve and then some. Watching it, even the other subplots involving a deaf Japanese girl, I could not escape the thought of how stupid and unlikable they were and it poisoned the whole movie for me. It's well acted, well directed, beautifully shot, but at the center is a plot that gets under my skin.",Babel
117,MichaelMargetis,One of the Most Powerful and Thought-Provoking Films I've Ever Seen,10,18 November 2007,"WOW! It's been four and a half hours since I left the theater showing 'Babel' and I'm still shaking just thinking about it. Rarely does a film come along so powerful, profound, original and important that it challenges the way you feel, think and believe. Last year the closest film that came close to that sort of power was 'Munich', this year it's Mexican filmmaker's sweeping masterful epic, 'Babel'.'Babel' is an intricate story of what desperate people do in desperate situations. It's about how self-absorbed we are, not only as Americans, but as humans, and how we put ourselves before anyone else. Many people will make claims such that 'Babel' is just like 'Crash', when in reality despite some common plot set-ups, the messages of the two films are completely different. People criticized the message of 'Crash' as being too obvious and too cheesy as if trying to persuade people to be more open-minded, while 'Babel' shows the same type of situation but kind of sends the message that this is the way people are and they are NEVER going to change, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 'Babel' despite having some optimistic plot turns, is a pessimistic movie. Those wanting feel-good entertainment value will despise 'Babel', but those looking for an incredibly well-made piece of art that requires a lot of brain power will worship the ground 'Babel' walks on.There is really nothing I can complain about in this movie. Everything is spectacular. This is Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's most ambitious work yet. His first Spanish-language film 'Amores Perros' was great but flawed. His second film '21 Grams' an intense domestic character study between three characters was near perfect. Three times must be a charm, because 'Babel' his third film, is ten times better than his first two films put together. Innaritu's directing is electrifying and original, but at the same time not too flashy or arrogant. Practically every frame is so beautifully captured it would probably make deceased legends like Hitchcock or Kubrick envious. One scene that comes to mind is shot in a Japanese night club where the deaf-mute Chieko is partying with her friends. The audio goes in and out constantly showing events from Chieko's perspective while audacious strobe lights flicker in the background. This scene alone should secure Innaritu an Oscar nomination, and might even win him the trophy itself. Innaritu's writing partner Guillermo Arriago provides an emotionally charged and cohesive screenplay. It doesn't have as much dialogue as say '21 Grams', because most of the interactions between the characters are spoken more in facial expressions/gestures. This is a beautiful thing especially since the acting of the film ranges from extraordinary to unbelievable.There isn't a single weak performance in this colossus of a motion picture. Despite Pitt and Blanchett's top billing, they do not have very big parts. In fact, nobody has a big part because there are too many characters in the film. 'Babel' is truly an ensemble piece and relies upon everyone turning in a superb performance, and it's succeeds with flying colors. Brad Pitt provides his best performance to date as a desperate American tourist trying to save the life of his wife in a foreign country. Blanchett is equally as stunning in a significantly smaller role. Mexican actress Adrianna Bazarra is Oscar material in her gut-wrenching portrayal of the affectionate Mexican nanny caught between a rock and a hard place. Gael Garcia Bernal and Koji Yakubusho are remarkable in unfortunately but understandably limited roles, while the child actors all shine, especially young Morrocan actor Said Tarchani whose performance is so compelling it wouldn't be impossible for him to pull a Keisha Castle Hughes and receive a Best Supporting Actor Oscar Nomination. Truly the best performance of the film comes from Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi who nails the role of deaf-mute teenager Chieko. Her performance is so indescribably heartbreaking, beautiful and amazing one could say she rivals Meryl Streep on a good day. Maybe this is due greatly to the fact Kikuchi's character is the most sympathetic, but in my mind a part is only as good as the actor playing it. If Kikuchi doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress this Academy Awards season, I'm boycotting the ceremony this year.All in all, 'Babel' is a masterfully crafted, constantly engaging and wholly original slice of film-making. I've never experienced anything like 'Babel' before and maybe that's part of what makes it such a breath of fresh air. 'Babel' is the kind of film not everyone will like. It will generally have two common effects -- you'll either be impressed by it or bored by it. After the cathartic and touching final scene when the credits started to roll the lady next to me scuffed and exclaimed, ""Stupid!"". That kind of reaction doesn't surprise me. Those looking for a film with easy answers that leaves you feeling complete at the end will despise 'Babel'. However, those actually going into the theater with an open mind and appreciation for the craft that goes into film-making will be knocked on their ass with amazement. In a year like 2006 that's over-flowing with magnificent cinema, 'Babel' stands at the top of the pile making it not only the best film of the year thus far, but without a doubt one of the best films I've ever had the privilege of seeing.

118,shark-43,"Harrowing, Well Made, Well Acted, But...",7,28 November 2006,"BABEL is a serious, well-made, well-acted movie that shows the simple act of giving a fire arm as a gift leads to a series of very tragic events - it also shows how important communication is - whether it is verbal, emotional or physical. I am a big fan of the director and the writer - Amores Perros is an incredibly powerful film and 21 Grams - even though I found it flawed - had amazing performances and still packed a punch. However, even though I admired BABEL and thought many scenes were brilliant - there was an exhaustive stretch of just pure human suffering that actually becomes repetitive. Now I am probably in the minority that I embrace movies that are very dark and make you think and am not always looking for just brain freeze escapism. But this film is so harrowing and filled with endless scenes of pure desperation and jeopardy, that after awhile you feel like a battered prisoner - you give up and go numb. Let me put it this way, it certainly isn't for everyone and it certainly isn't a ""nice time at the movies"" - but it certainly shows in a very moving way that we ARE all very much alike - in a very basic human way. Whether a poor goat farmer in Morroco or a Japanese deaf-mute teenager or a well off American couple or a hardworking Mexican nanny - we all just want to love and be loved. I have seen many comparisons to CRASH in the comments here and I certainly understand why - but I actually feel BABEL is after more than just pure simple race relations - if you strip it all away, it is all about family and the love of family and how one can or cannot cope with tragedy within your family. Very well made but one has to be in the ""mood"" for it.",Babel
119,judywalker2,Different,7,14 November 2006,"This was certainly a very different movie. I guess you could take it one of two ways; either one poor choice can have dire consequences or human beings should stop punishing each other for one poor choice.The characters in this film all make a few poor choices with mostly good intentions. A father makes a choice for his sons. A husband and wife make a choice not to deal with something. A babysitter makes a choice to continue her responsibility. We all have made choices that we regret and whether we are rich or poor we have sometimes been punished harshly for them. Would we take back our choices if given a second chance, probably yes. But we don't. We just have to live with them. I think the title wants to say something about listening to each other and I think that if the explanation for the choice is plausible the punishment (mostly served up by other men who have made poor choices) should befit the bad choice, especially if unintentional consequences resulted and not some more horrendous premeditated crime.",Babel
120,bregund,"Boring, Pointless, Preachy",3,11 March 2007,"There's a movie in here somewhere, but just try to find it under the thick layers of anti-American propaganda. If there's anything worse than overbearing, generalistic conservatism, it is overbearing, generalistic liberalism, and this movie is a buffet of the latter; it is thick enough to cut with a knife. From the oppressed Mexican nanny to the comedy of errors that results in a boy being labeled a terrorist, the finger of blame is repeatedly pointed at America for its unpopular international policies. This movie feeds on the suspicion among the American population that something is terribly wrong with our secretive government, an assessment with which I wholeheartedly agree, but painting all Americans in broad strokes does as much a disservice to we as individuals as it does to believe that all Moroccans are terrorists.The whitest, blondest, palest American woman (Cate Blanchett) just happens to be the target of a shooting, and the Moroccan government goes into overdrive trying to find her shooter, simply because she's American. It isn't enough that her shooting is the catalyst for an international incident, but she's petty and whiny and demanding during the scene where they stop for lunch. Newsflash, people: not all Americans are like this when they travel, most of us take the time to absorb the local culture and graciously accept the largesse of our hosts, even if it's just a bus tour. Criminy.Worse still is the entire escape-to-Mexico scene. The nanny takes the children from their sterile American home to a lively music-filled Mexican wedding south of the border, filled with games, smiling people, and piles of food. Of course, all these things don't exist in America, and when they try to get back in, the evil U.S. government tries to prevent them from coming back. I almost laughed when the nanny was wandering through the desert in the hot sun, the scene went on far too long to be dramatic and instead became humorous. It was kind of like the scene in Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein when he wrestles with the monster for five minutes; drama turns into unintentional comedy. Anyway, the Mexican director then goes on to manipulate the viewer into feeling incredibly guilty that the nanny is deported, despite the fact that she could easily sneak across the border again and find another nanny job somewhere else.No point can be interpreted from the Japanese storyline; it just kind of sits there having nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the movie. It largely consists of open-mouthed stares by the principal actors, and a young girl experimenting with her sexuality...THAT'S IT.All in all, there is nothing particularly enlightening or substantive about this film, it is empty and devoid of purpose. It doesn't teach anything or show any new ways of seeing things. It's not groundbreaking, and the interlocking storyline has been done much better, most notably by Robert Altman, who invented it and used it to great effect in Nashville.",Babel
121,loganx-2,"""I Shall Confuse Your Languages And Scatter You Across The Earth""",10,12 June 2008,"The best picture of 2006, four narratives about communication breakdown shot on location in four different countries, spanning three continents. From the neon lights of Tokyo disco techs, to accidental shootings in the Moroccan desert, into an American vacation and dissolving marriage, and into a Mexican wedding and boarder tension this film paints a portrait of a world teeming with cultural, linguistic, and emotional barriers.In the Bible Babel was a city that united humanity, all speaking a single language and migrating from the east; it was the first city to be built after the Great Flood(as in Noah). The people decided their city should have a tower so immense that it would have ""its top in the heavens."" However, the Tower of Babel was not built for the worship and praise of God, but was dedicated to false man-made religion, with a motive of making a 'name' for the builders - Genesis 11:4. God seeing what the people were doing and sinning against him, confused their languages and scattered the people throughout the earth."" Not that this is a religious allegory, but the confused nature of language, seems a pretty good metaphor for Guillermo Arriaga(screen-writer) and Inarruti's vision of the world. Not that you needed to know that to enjoy the movie, but a little context never hurt nobody. Anyway good movie.For a conclusion to the trilogy of ""death"", there's not really too much ""death"" in this movie. Personally I don't get the connection, but whatever it's a good flick.",Babel
122,CinematicInceptions,Brutally Realistic.,8,3 August 2017,"Of the four Inarritu movies I've seen (Birdman, The Revenant, and Amores Perros), I definitely consider this the best. The trailer stresses the inability for people of different cultures to communicate effectively as the theme, but it felt more like a constant obstacle. What I loved about the movie was the way it was able to go where the vast majority of movies don't dare to go and make me cringe a bit. Moments like Chieko asking the detective to come to her apartment and even little moments like the two American kids watching the Mexican guy killing the chicken are what made this such a striking and great movie. It's quite dark in tone, even more so because it's not dark or sad the entire time. The fun afternoon Chieko has makes her insecurity and pain even more tangible. And the joy of Amelia's son's wedding makes it that much worse when she can't get the two kids back to the states.This story is not entirely plausible in a time sense. Realistically, all of the events would not have occurred all within the same week. But the same can really be said of any movie in which the protagonist happens to be dealing with internal and external problems that are both resolved in the same climax. And outside of the convenient/inconvenient timing, the movie is incredibly realistic in the sense of how the characters behave in each situation. More than that, it points to the way that everyone is connected to people in countries far away from where we live whether we realize it or not.The characters were not the most memorable, but they were very human and I could totally sympathize with all of their different conflicts. A saying that is used a lot to guide writers is ""the universal is in the specific"", and that held true here. I'm not and hopefully never will be deaf or mute, but I understood how Chieko feels when she sees her friend that can speak a little get with the guy that Chieko likes. Even the two Moroccan kids who initiate the whole whirlwind of events can be sympathized with in their guilt. We are given a little insight into cach character's or group of character's backstory and personal lives. Not all of these are totally relevant to the story, but they do add to it by keeping the focus on the individuals and how their personal problems impact the other story lines rather than making a big deal out of the news story side of things. If you are considering it, be cautioned that it is a very disturbing movie that will shock you at several points and it probably won't leave you feeling hopeful. I think it's much better for being disturbing, but many people might not. On the upside, it's not gory or pornographic. The presence of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett do not detract at all from the other foreign actors. They aren't the protagonists and aren't given any more attention or screen time than the other character groups. Also, the characters are all portrayed by actors of the proper ethnicity; in other words it's not whitewashed. I'll close by paraphrasing one of that lines that was used in advertising the movie: If you don't see it, you'll end up living it. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",Babel
123,ClaytonDavis,"So much to learn, so little time...",8,30 October 2006,"Walking into a movie theater there are neutral expectations that enters the average viewer, being entertained being the most prevalent, enjoy the moments ahead whether it's in comedy, drama, musical, etc. is important to every movie-goer. No person wants to waste time or money on a film that will be keep them in the realization of being in a movie theater. The next usually depends on what genre you are watching, in this case drama, you searching to be moved, possibly learn something that will open your mind, heart, and soul to a brand new idea. The idea usually pushes the bar to new extremes such as past films as Crash, Forrest Gump, and even though aging poorly American Beauty. Babel, the newest addition to the Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu film series of unique narratives is an immense film with a beautiful cast ensemble that is dedicated to the cause yet it becomes insanely heavy to the viewer and forces an immediate disengagement from the film if even for minutes at a time to catch a breath.The film is told in four different languages: Arabic, English, Spanish, and Japanese. (I do believe there is some French in there too.) We are thrown into four interwoven, grim tales of racism, discrimination barriers and journey seeking courage. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play Richard and Susan, a married couple vacationing in Morocco to reignite any flame left of their marriage but a coincidence will leave them stranded in a series of conflict, tragedy, and helpless, thousands of miles from ""civilization."" Koji Yakusho and Rinko Kikuchi are ""Yasujiro"" and ""Chieko,"" father and daughter living in Japan trying to rebuild a relationship since the untimely death of Chieko's mother. Two unknown young actors portray Moroccan brothers who instigate the events of the film. Adriana Barraza is Amelia, a Mexican nanny living in the United States taking care of Richard and Susan's children as they deal with their situation. Due to circumstances, she decides to travel to Mexico to attend her son's wedding with the children. Her unconditional care for the children is the emotional center of the picture and is where the film finds prosperity.The film is unusual but accurate, awkward but compelling, and bizarre yet organic. The film's cinematography is gorgeous panning in and out of the stories as if we were living right beside the disposition. Crisp, clear editing add to the depiction but this is where I needed the breather. The viewer never feels jaded by the narrative but as the writing is so thought provoking, the message being whispered, to say the least, feels at times being thrashed over the skull. I learned a lot which might be an understatement but there's a line between being taught and being abused. Several times, I had to close my eyes just to remember that my life isn't as bad as these individuals and that there is some communication between people without bloodshed, insult or tragedy.The performances are by far one of the finest depictions of contemporary characters in recent memory. They're raw, intense, pure and actual in expressions as the actors deliver them to us. Brad Pitt gives his finest performance to date although not the best of the year by any measurement. Pitt finds the inner most personal parts of Richard and illustrates it to the audience. With his name alone, it should likely carry him to the top five. Baffles me how he is first billed, or any the four actors listed, and this is claimed to be an ensemble piece.(which it clearly is) The great Cate Blanchett whom is reserved to cries, screams and yells shows us she is still ""Cate that Great,"" even in the smallest of roles.The revelation of the film comes from the elder, Adriana Barraza and the young and fearsome Rinko Kikuchi. As stated earlier, Barraza's devotion to the children are the emotional center of the film but the role didn't become alive until the finale. Also, like Blanchett, she is relegated to simple, repetitive gestures but is given the chance to excel and shine right out the silver screen. Kikuchi, whom is deaf and mute in the film, is utterly heartbreaking. Let's imagine Holly Hunter from The Piano and multiply that by a death of a mother, a yearning to be loved, and a sincere feel of desperation. Kikuchi eyes alone will leave you shambles as the story progresses. It's her story that teaches this viewer the most but makes unfasten himself from the car and open the window for fresh air.Oscar prospects will more than likely see Babel in the Best Picture race with Innaritu locking up a director's spot. Directing in many languages should bring acclaim on its own before viewers even see the film. It was as if he spoke in the many tongues of language and everyone understands him perfectly. Guillermo Arriaga is also locking up an Original Screenplay nomination and he is long overdue with past snubs with 21 Grams and Amores Perros. I believe it'll be Arriaga, Emilio Estevez for Bobby, and Michael Arndt for Little Miss Sunshine battling it out all season long. Editing and cinematography are also feasible. Babel is a great experience and I'm sure others will probably find out superb and tremendous but this is not Crash by any means rather belongs in a category all its own. Enjoy the experience.Grade: ***1/2/****",Babel
124,diane-34,Not for the faint hearted.,9,25 February 2007,"I am pretty much a film coward and anybody that has seen this excellent movie knows exactly what I am talking about even if they did not see anything dreadfully harrowing in this film. Recently I have watched Blood Diamond and Last King of Scotland and was not disturbed in the least by them. Babel, however, maybe because it dealt so accurately with the banality of human existence kept me on edge through out the film. I think that this comment speaks massively about the brilliance of the direction of Gonzalez. He was able to keep me nervous through the entire movie and yet, as with the best of entertainment, this nervousness resulted in a rewarding cinematic experience. Only the best can keep you in your seat while you are secretly ready to leave and thinking, ""to hell with further action on the screen"".My wife, Diane, thought the movie was pretentious, a descriptor that never entered my mind. I found the scenarios all too real--I know what happens with young kids and guns; I know the tremendous pull of domestic events that demand your presence even though you should ignore that call and I think I understand the terror and anger that drives a person to allude the police at all costs. I believe, because I know a young handicapped girl about the same age as the screen actor, that the extraordinary personal struggle faced by young people dealing with a disability was exceptionally accurately portrayed. I believe that Arriaga, the writer, used a seemingly trivial action in Morocco to tie the entire movie together and that he assembled a virtually definitive selection of all too human foibles to construct, what for me, was an extremely accurate insight into the trauma that is waiting to strike us at anytime. It would be difficult to recreate such a collection of those scenarios that wait around the corner of human existence. Brilliant movie in all respects!",Babel
125,iohefy-2,What was it ????,3,27 February 2007,"I went to see this movie with great anticipation, and boy was I unpleasantly surprised. First off the cinematography was an abortion, with the screen jumping and leaping with a frenzy. The constant jumping back and forth with the four stories it was telling was totally confusing and at the end of the movie, you were not much closer to a full explanation of how these stories intertwined. The acting in the picture was pretty good, but no where near Acadamy Award quality. My suggestion to all who anticipate going to see this bomb, think about it and save yourself the price of admission. I wish some one had warned me ahead of time. Heed my advice.

126,bsinc,Neither entertaining nor meaningful,6,8 February 2007,"""Babel"" demands a lot of energy from the viewer but it doesn't even try to return the favor. I found it exhausting and depressing and painfully meaningless: Three stories that don't seem connected at first glance basically end up staying that way...there's merely small references here and there that supposedly bind them together, but sadly there's no real point to even portraying any of these 3 stories in the first place. They are merely sad segments of different people's lives in different situations...a sarcastic ""wow"".It can easily be compared to ""Crash"": you have similar storytelling and a similar concept of different lives that change dramatically in a specific moment in time, so the ending intentionally doesn't make any conclusions and doesn't answer questions...that's left to us. So far so good. But ""Crash"" I think had something to say, whereas ""Babel"" struggles to scrap its content.I couldn't have cared less for any of the characters and I was glad when the charade was over (I was constantly skipping through the .torrent file as well). ""Babel"" can't really be labeled a bad film but it's a poor man's ""Crash"" or ""21 grams"" (sorry, haven't seen ""Amores Perros"" yet) wannabe.",Babel
127,Flagrant-Baronessa,Four stories. Three countries. One powerful film.,8,3 November 2006,"If you  like me, and so many others  found 'Crash' (2005) offensively finger-wagging and dumb (its inherent message was: ""Racism is bad.""), Alejandro González Iñárritu's Babel will make it up to you with refreshing intelligence, respect for cultures and crisp acting. The plot outline is difficult to do justice in one sentence but much like Crash it explores culture clashes in life by navigating multiple interweaving story lines.One of these is the story of the married couple Richard and Susan Jones, played by Pitt and Blanchett, who travel to Morocco 'to get away'. Theirs is a remarkably complex and bruised marriage at first but once the plot gradually unfolds the root of their problems becomes apparent. What is most remarkable about their storyline is that Brad Pitt actually emotes as an actor (although is he is grossly facilitated by heartfelt circumstances) and that Cate Blanchett regrettably never gets the chance to shine in her performance.Cut to two young Arabic boys in the barren craggy hills of the outback of Morocco. They are brothers whom have just been given a rifle by their father to protect their goats and now they are having fun in learning how to fire the weapon. There is refreshing gritty honesty in the portrayal of this storyline  from the dirt and heat on their clothes to the realistic dialogue  and many heartrending moments due to the aforementioned. But be warned, this is no glossy or romantic depiction of North Africa...Another storyline takes place in colourful Tokyo in Japan, detailing the teenage life of a deaf girl called Chieko. Hers is arguably the most compelling story especially in terms of sheer fun to be had. Being a teenage girl is hard enough and Chieko finds that her disability distances her from other people  the boys she is interested in looks at her like she is a monster  and frustrated and desperate to be loved, she indulges in teenage clichés like partying and drinking in the modern mess that is Tokyo. Here I found the single most vivid disco sequence completely sucking me in and not letting go until the fast-paced euphoria of Chieko finally subsided. There is absolute gold to be found in this Tokyo story.Finally, the last storyline takes place in Mexico and the main character is a woman called Amelia (Adriana Barraza), who also happens to be Richard and Susan's nanny. When her son is getting married in Mexico and she cannot get a day off, she takes the kids with her across the border. Big mistake. I'm sure many will be able to identify with the sprawling surge of Mexican culture at the wedding and indeed the music and pace made this storyline both beautiful and enjoyable to follow. It is evident that director Alejandro González Iñárritu feels most at home in this setting and as a result, the story shines and its characters emote.Although there is a lot to keep track of in 'Babel' owing to its many story lines, there is such a fluent and seamless intercutting of these segments that it is impossible not to be entranced in the entirety of the film. There is a wealth of juxtapositions of culture to be found and much fun and visual stimulation to be had because of it. From the dramatic barren landscapes of Morocco to the fast-paced teen world of Tokyo, Babel treats contrast with remarkable sensitivity and skill of the subject matter. In other words, it gives a nonsentimental yet compassionate insight into the lives of different people whose stories orbit around the kaleidoscope that is 'Babel', sewn together by unsparing and uninhibited performances. Better yet, you get so caught up in each story that when it cuts to make room for the next you feel almost a little offended  and that is good film-making. Babel, given its content, is everything Crash was not. Finally, it offers a satisfying and humble conclusion to an otherwise epic film. Although I cannot help but remark, Iñárritu, come on  you could have made a good movie in less than 2½ hours... *hmph*8 out of 10",Babel

129,majikstl,Six degrees of desperation ...,4,2 March 2007,"If you set up dominoes on end and in a row, it would seem that the only possible reason to do so would be to let them fall in that order -- the domino effect. The story told in BABEL is a row of dominoes, which for some inexplicable reason are made to fall in a chaotic fashion; a few dominoes tumble here, then a few over there and few someplace else. Instead of a dramatic flow, the result is not so much a maze as it is a mess. A saga that almost demands that it be told in order -- repeated causes and effects -- unfolds seemingly at random.In BABEL there are four separate stories being told and they seem to be running concurrently -- then one story seems to have happened in the past, or maybe not; and soon it is apparent that another, or maybe two, is taking place after the others, well, maybe -- or maybe not; it is all very confusing, and apparently it is confusing on purpose. Perhaps, having seen PULP FICTION one too many times, director Alejandro González Iñárritu thought this was a cool way to tell a story. But at least PULP FICTION told each of its tales more or less completely before moving on to its next out-of-sequence episode. BABEL tells its narrative like a shuffled deck of cards; the viewer spends more time sorting out the story than being absorbed in it. And unlike, say MEMENTO, the act of organizing the details in a logical fashion in the end doesn't enhance the power of the story or create order out of chaos, it only sticks the viewer with an unjustified burden. BABEL is a gimmick film that thinks it is being ingenious, when it isn't even being clever.The saga takes place on three continents in four countries, with tales that hang together by the barest of threads. The idea is that something that happens in one place can have far-reaching, unforeseen effects on people thousands of miles away. Okay, great. In this case the father of a deaf teenage girl in Japan gives his rifle to his hunting guide in Morocco, who sells it to a neighbor who gives it to his sons, who recklessly fire it at a passing tourist bus and wound a woman from San Diego, who left her children in the care of a nanny who is an illegal alien from Mexico who takes the kids across the border to attend a wedding, but runs afoul of the border agents while trying to return to the United States and ends up stranded in the desert where they all might die. Whew! (Now take that sentence and randomly jumble the words and see if you can make sense of the plot!) The basic premise of BABEL is sound and could be intriguing; it is the execution that renders the drama empty and strangely devoid of passion. There are scattered moments of intense drama in the story, but the skewed timeline renders those moments adrift in confusion. Iñárritu's seemingly desperate attempt to force great relevance on these stories by jamming them into each other fails miserably. For instance, the entire drama about the Japanese schoolgirl, whose fighting depression and sexual angst due to her mother's suicide, is by itself interesting, but her psychological turmoil really doesn't have any bearing on the other stories. Plus, her potentially fascinating nervous breakdown is chopped up into irrelevant pieces. It is the same with the other stories; the incompetent hacking up of the stories destroys all momentum and drains the admittedly compelling situations of their dramatic power.I honestly can't think of a legitimate artistic reason for Iñárritu and his screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga to resort to his hodgepodge style of film-making, other than to disguise the fact that the ironic connections the filmmakers want to make just aren't there. For all its international globe-trotting, the basic storyline could have all happened in one place. And despite the notion, implied by the title, that language differences are the source of the turmoil, the chaos seems to spring from stupid people doing stupid things. For all of its politically correct multi-ethnic posturing about terrorist paranoia and the victimization of illegal aliens, the whole story boils down to being about how people from far away cause bad things to happen to a white, middle-class American family. Unintentional xenophobia seems to be the only glue that actually holds the film together.",Babel
130,socrates99,I find the varied reactions to the brilliant Babel a little hard to believe,9,27 January 2007,"In today's Sun-Times (Chicago) a priest columnist complains that for him Babel is anti-American from beginning to end. He seems to think that Brad Pitt's yelling at the desert people standing helplessly around him was somehow disrespectful. But if MY wife was in the predicament his character's wife is in, I would be acting very much like him. And I don't rattle easily. It's just that if you've ever done back country traveling, you're quite aware that you are truly on your own and any help you get is sheer luck. And at any rate, clearly these desert people have no problem understanding his distress. In fact it's actually other Westerners who have the most trouble accepting the magnitude of his plight.Be that as it may, I find it curious that I don't recall this priest mentioning the Japanese segment that contains some full frontal nudity. Not long ago that would have been ALL he wrote about. Now to my surprise, it's ME who somewhat objects. Don't get me wrong I was astounded at how well the director was able to explore and detail this very Japanese part of the film. In fact, I'd say that segment easily doubled my ability to grasp the Japanese culture despite having spent many an hour watching movies like the 'Seven Samurai' and having read long originally Japanese-language novels like 'Musashi.' Still I was reluctant to have the wonderful Japanese actress in this segment (who's been awarded an Oscar nomination for her role) made naked. And yet if there was ever a role that could accommodate a little nudity, this is it. And frankly I think it's this segment which is the best of the lot.This is not an easy film to watch, but it's masterful and very wise and very few of us won't be able to benefit from watching it. My wife who was reluctant to go said the two plus hours went by very quickly as they did for me.",Babel
131,dead47548,Listen.,8,8 January 2008,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's two previous films, Amores Perros and 21 Grams, dealt with the subject of very different people being connected on a small scale. Babel takes a different approach, but has the same central theme. The plot follows four different stories that stretch the entire globe (Morocco, Japan, Mexico and a few minutes in America) and shows how one single bullet can effect the lives of people so far apart. Guillermo Arriaga's script is breathtaking and perfectly structures this vast array of characters. Within minutes of being with them, we know exactly who they are and what drives their current personality. This gives time for the epic story to play out.It's all centered around two young boys who are fooling around with a rifle and accidentally shoot American tourist Susan (Cate Blanchett) who is on ""vacation"" with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt). Though never directly saying it, it's quite clear that one of their son's died and Richard panicked and left his family behind; leaving Susan to care for their two remaining children. He came back and their vacation to Morocco was really just an excuse for them to get away and try to get their marriage back together. Ultimately it does bring them back to each other, but it takes tragedy to do so. Brad Pitt's performance is one of the finest of 2006 and his internal pain and emotional strength manage to bring a river of tears flowing from my eyes. It's his best performance since Twelve Monkeys and further proves that through all of the controversy of his social life, he's still a phenomenal actor. Back in America, their nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) is taking care of their two children while they are gone. Through unfortunate circumstances she has to bring them to Mexico for her son's wedding and things take a huge turn for the worse when they try to cross back over into America.The final story is a much further departure from the rest of the characters. It centers around a deaf-mute Japanese schoolgirl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) who struggles with the pain of being so different from everyone else along with her mother's apparent suicide and the police's attempt at questioning her father about a gun he gave to a Moroccan man (the gun used to shoot Susan).While most people believe that the film is about how people living so close to each other can be so different, I actually feel that it's the exact opposite. I think it's a story of how people so far apart (on different continents, speaking different languages) are almost exactly alike. All of the stories center around similar themes; loneliness, alienation, depression, the loss of a loved one and more while Arriaga never forgets to subtly mention the political outrage that comes from an American woman being shot in a foreign country. Every character feels the same emotions, deals with similar pain and are all connected by this single shooting. Babel starts off as a film about very different people in very different worlds, but ends up being one studying human nature and showing that even when we're worlds apart people we can still be so similar. All you have to do is listen.",Babel
132,charchuk,Well-intentioned but disastrous,4,26 February 2007,"An utter mess of a film, redeemed somewhat by some good performances, but overall just not very good. The multiple stories never feel connected outside of their base narrative elements, and none of them resolve satisfyingly. The Japan story is by far the best, mostly due to Kikuchi's performance, but it has its problems as well. The two Moroccan stories are okay, with Cate being completely wasted and the kids being pretty annoying. And the Mexico story was a disaster, full of stupid characters doing even stupider things. A nice score, some good direction, and an occasional great scene cannot save this film from catastrophe.

While Apcalypto ( directed by infamous, self-proclaimed racist Mel Gibson) was a pointless, flawed action-gore fest that showed only the negative of one's culture, Babel gives a more coherent view presented in four stories throughout. This film explores the lives of these different cultures and each of their stories are interwoven and filled with tragedy, loneliness, irony and recklessness. In my opinion, the performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and the others are top-notch compared with Mel Gibson's film which I felt was over the top. Apcalypto was filled with gratuitous violence and historical mishaps, Babel instead gives a bigger piece of the pie. There are moments of violence and innuendo that may offend some, but doesn't hurt the film. And the dialog spoken in different languages is also a plus and gives the film's atmosphere more depth. Babel is a much more coherent take on the cultures of the world and that's why I like it more than Apocalypto.",Babel

We need to get to know a character and care about them before anything that happens to them means anything to us. That is just basic rule one. So why did Paramount fund this deeply unsympathetic movie? Plenty of comments here have explained how contrived the episodes are. Just consider: + a coach-load of Europeans are utterly unsympathetic with a young mother who has been randomly shot and is mortal danger. Nobody even lends a hand to carry her, let alone nurse her. Ridiculous! + A dedicated housekeeper and governess who works in the USA illegally takes two blond children with her to her native Mexico, stays up all night, and expects no problems at the border. Tell me another! + A deaf-mute in Tokyo aged about sixteen is so horny she completely undresses for a policeman she noticed earlier in the day, when her father is expected back at any minute. Oh yeah? + An Arab boy of about eight years old casually shoots at a tour bus to prove to his brother the carbine works at a distance. Du-u-h!

Yes, this flip-flop form is like reading an episodic novel. When it is done well, as in ""Babel' with major talent, notably good performances by Pitt, Blanchett and Barraza, and adequate budget, it represents the Zeitgeist of political and social issues as viewed by the post-Cold-War, detached, muddled politicos in the wealthy arts. Yes, life is chaotic and fragile. Yes, life is filled with coincidences, especially when viewed in retrospect through a lens. Yet, this film seems to herald a new existentialism, as opposed to a secular humanism. 'We're all bozos on this bus' for a new millennium. And, now, the bus is likely to be searched at the border or hit by a stray bullet from a gun in the hand of a child.

And of course, there are sadly millions of people who fit into this mold, but what is the real point of having this shoved down your throat.

A young boy watches his younger sister strip for him. Why? What was the point? The same boy is shown masturbating. Again,why? Brad Pitt's character helps his wife in having a bowl movement. I'm lost.

It's almost as if the writers went ""hey let's just loosely weave four weak stories together and see what message audiences come up with"".From what I could see, any message you could pull out of it was fundamentally weak. The only message I could get was that we are responsible for the choices we make, and if that's the case, we all know that. Why not just tell people to watch Spiderman 3?

Don't be seduced by the Art House brigade. The story (three interwoven) is poorly told. The characters lack depth. There is an almost total lack of pace.Although shot beautifully,and what action there is, is well captured, this in no way compensates from a project which conspires to be ""clever"", but simply implodes into the vacuum of a desperately ill executed tale.Ironically, the story is one of poor communication between characters - the fact that it communicates so poorly it's message to it's audience is no doubt lost on the film's supporters.

139,bobbobwhite,Similar emotions felt as with the film Traffic,7,29 January 2007,"Well done mixing of three initially separate stories that eventually intertwined, as was done in the director's last film 21 Grams, but not as well done as in 21 Grams. He does his difficult style welland it is compelling to try to figure out early on how one story will eventually relate to the others. But, at some point his style may get in the way of the enjoyment of future good stories well told, and I can see this possibly happening if he continues film-making in this style. Every style gets old after a few tries.I enjoyed the Morocco story best and the Japanese story the least, as I found the stark desert settings and the harsh story surrounding the impoverished Arabic kid shooting the American woman on the bus the most compelling, even though the film's technical mistakes and story flaws I saw were in this part. Most of the Japanese story did not relate to the eventual conclusion and was close to being totally about a teenage girl's sexual/boy frustration and angst over being deaf in a hearing world, and didn't have nearly as much connection with the whole as did the other two stories. The Mexican story was very well done, sad and realistic, but it was out of time sequence with the Moroccan segment, as we saw at the end that all of the Mexican story happened after the Moroccan one was over, and not simultaneously. A lot of my initial excitement and interest was in thinking that all three stories were happening at the exact same time. Two of them mostly were, so why not the third? No reason not to have them run more or less concurrently that I could see.Technicals: in the Moroccan story, the boy shot at the bus face on but the bullet came through a side window at a sharp angle, but I guess it could have angled off a rock. Also, it didn't seem realistic that the police were totally consumed with finding the person who shot the victim and seemingly not at all interested in finding the near-dead victim and making sure that she got immediate treatment. The local police had sense enough to immediately release detailed information internationally about the rifle used, and the Japanese police then sought the Japanese owner diligently, but the local Moroccan police didn't even look for the bleeding victim right in their immediate area? Very strange, and knowing how policemen are trained it felt wrong as they only did part of their primary job, which is the same worldwide.Overall, this film made me feel similar to the way I felt watching the equally gritty films about racial clashing, Traffic and Crash. If you liked those two, you will like Babel. The director's film-making style, the good acting and soaring cinematography, and the choices of scene settings in the film will be enjoyed by most.ps: I do not write movie reviews to get glowing reader comments, like some do here.

Though lots of people might hate it, I liked this film a lot. And this review explains why.Brad Pitt, and Cate Blanchett star in it. I wouldn't go out of my way just to see it for Brad Pitt, which would be a waste.The film starts out with a man in Morroco receiving a rifle. He shows it to his family and the kids decide they like it. One of the kids has an incestuous desire for her sister. The kids go out and decide to test the rifle, and find out that it was the wrong choice, that the bullet hit a woman in a bus! We see the situation from the woman's- and her husband's- point of view.""Honey... why did we come here?"" On the way back to the hotel, she gets shot. Well, you know where that came from. Anyways, we see the story of a brother and sister looked after by a Latin woman. The next day, the kids are taken into Mexico for a wedding with the woman's friend. On the way home, the man is pulled over... and escapes, leaving the police to look for him! Now, the kids and the woman have escaped into the desert.In Japan, we see the story of Cheiko, a beautiful, sexually frustrated, deaf-mute Japanese (well, obviously) woman. Her dad just so happens to be related with the rifle, and Cheiko is desperate for a love and sex life. She wants to be loved by a boy her age.Babel is not a good film to watch when you're depressed, though I didn't. I watched it while having dinner, and my heart was pounding all the way through.

141,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,One of the greatest politics-thriller in years.,8,17 June 2008,"Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted, Babel is inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated on Amores Perros and 21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely Hew fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. Yet Babel isn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both inter cultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intra cultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. Iñárritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a ""happy"" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution.

While director, Allejandro Gonzalez Inarritu DID have some success in this genre with his DEATH TRILOGY: Amores Perros (2000), 21 Grams (2003), Babel (2006). The later, the one reviewed here, seemed totally contrived and unbelievable to me. Here, three seemly separate stories in distant locations—San Diego (and Mexico), Morocco (and Tunisia) and Tokyo—come together in the end. But, to pull these stories together to make some sort of statement, I had to stretch credulity beyond MY ability.==Why would an American couple go to Morocco to straighten their marital difficulties?==Why would a Japanese man visit Morocco to hunt? I think that Inarritu was trying to make statements about three VERY disparate current issues--gun control, illegal immigration, and fear of terrorism. But, he seemed forced to stray TOO far to cram all these issues into one movie.BUT STILL, themes DO come though in the movie: 1) that there is a lack of communication between cultures and languages; 2) that we all have common ground as humans beings; 3) that we all face unknown fears; and that we all share certain hopes and fears.AND ANOTHER THEME that seemed clear to me, had to do with the innocence and vulnerability of children and the need to recognize that fact: The most moving of the stories was the segment about a young Japanese deaf- mute girl and her feeling of alienation--from both her family, her friends, and ultimately, herself.",Babel

144,shanfloyd,Extremely original and thought-provoking.,9,25 May 2007,"Babel is one those few movies which is made from the beginning to the very last scene with the one thing - excellence. Its extremely eccentric choice of plot and its execution make it another modern-day classic. The four seeming different stories in four very different cultural backgrounds are beautifully shown to convey similar messages to provoke our thoughts and indulge into discussions.Four different story lines continuing in three different locations... and not in the same time frame either. It was really the director's challenge to keep us equally interested in each story while having a deliberately weak link among themselves. The story set in Japan might seem entirely disconnected from the beginning, but frankly, who cares? It was extremely well-written and well-acted, and conveys the similar central theme about family importance or how we take wrong decisions. The two stories set up in Morrocco are indeed excellent. Besides the film's central themes, they also portray the still-existing cultural prejudices between the developed and the third-world countries with a bitter ironic twist about the importance of death in these two cultures. One could say that it's somehow a slap in the faces of those of us who talk big words about terrorism from our easy chairs.And how can I express enough praise about the film's overall acting? From celebrated actors like Brad Pitt and Gael Garcia Bernal to the unknown faces who portrayed Youssef or Ahmed or Cheiko, somehow they all managed to be inspired by the film's inner elegance and let out their best efforts. And they were accompanied by the most brilliant screenplay and cinematography as well.Babel is not a film to watch in a tired mind. Make sure you have the enough time and circumstances to just sit back and think, after you see this film.",Babel
145,Jacques98,Pain is universal. So are pointless movies.,2,10 December 2008,"Let me open this up with something completely unrelated to Babel. Have you ever seen a horror movie that was so unintentionally cheesy and unoriginal that you simply could not think of a worse way to waste your time? I can think at least twenty of those off the top of my head. Similarly, Babel has the equal effect for the drama genre.I'm not big on watching dramas, but I've seen enough to know that Babel is simply does nothing but rehash the tired cliché that is unabashedly uses as its tagline on the back cover: ""Pain is universal . . . but so is hope."" Simply put, this, the only theme the movie tries to shed any light on, is just as unoriginalif not more unoriginalthan that cheesy horror movie I just asked you to think of. How many times do we have to be force-fed the same thing over and over again before directors realize that we get it? People here in American share the same pain as the Mexican immigrant. Haven't we seen this on daytime television? We get it.So, if we already understand the main point the movie was trying to get across, what's the point of even watching it? There is simply nothing whatsoever here that even loosely resembles entertainment value, unless you like watching people stare at each other for fun. I'm completely for movies that deeply scar the viewer and are unsettling to watch, but that's the thing: they have to be something the viewer hasn't seen before to do that. It seems to be a common thing for pretentious people to think that a movie has to be a chore to watch, otherwise it's not intelligent, and if it is a chore to watch, it must be intelligent. It's a lot like the view a lot of my friends have that if a book isn't long and boring it has nothing of value to say. I'm sorry to break your intellectual bubble, but if that is your honest opinion, you have a ridiculously unlogical view on storytelling.With all of that said, I don't think Babel is an absolutely bad film. I can understand how some people may find it moving if they relate to one of the characters. This review is not looking at it from that standpoint whatsoever. I personally found Babel somewhat moving, and it did make me cry once, but that doesn't mean I liked it or found it any less pointless than Jason X, there Friday the 13th takes the story arc all the way to space. In reality, they're both equally as pointless because they're both equally unoriginal in their respective genres. In simple terms: they're both a waste of your life. Just because a film has an emotional impact on someone doesn't mean it's worth watching. People don't seem to understand this, and it's sad to see so many high scores for Babel just because it made them bawl.Another problem I have with Babel is that it uses shock value to get its cliché points across, and it does it in such a way that it makes the entire movie nearly laughable. In pure politically correct fashion, the opening scenes pulls off the cliché masturbation sequence (obscuring his penis) that we've seen in so many movies it's hard to even take the movie seriously from then on. Was I supposed to be disgusted? I wasn't. I just found it cheesy. Then later in the movie, we see full nudity of a girl (again, obscuring her vagina in a politically correct fashion) that is meant to show her pain. Uh-huh. All I took away from that scene was how far directors will go to shock, only to find out that the audience was laughing at them. I'll simply never understand American's obsession with on-screen nudity for the most pointless reasons. If anything, it cheeses up everything. Naked people work in American Pie; not in Babel.On a technical level, Babel is pretty solid. Solid directing. Solid acting. There is nothing here that is too impressive, and nothing here that is something to be complained about. I watched the entire movie and didn't even realize Brad Pitt played the main character until I read the box afterward. I think that says a lot about how average even the big-name cast acted in this movie. Cate Blanchett lays on the floor through the entire movie. You don't even see her face through 2/3 of her screen time. Who cares if you pay the money for big names then don't sue their talent? In the end, the lack of anything even remotely new or original mixed with the lack of any entertainment value makes Babel one of the most pointless movies I've ever seen. Could someone be emotionally effected? Sure. Does that really mean it needs as much acclaim as it's getting while truly original movies get thrown by the wayside? 2/10",Babel
146,luke-a-mcgowan,A film for your consideration of humanity,6,27 November 2014,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu directs a complex morality play in the style of Crash, and whilst his script isn't as compelling nor as clever as Crash, what results is still a very impressive weave of human stories. Balancing many shades of darkness and many tortured characters who end up being the antagonists of each others stories, Babel is one of those films that may cause you to lose faith in humanity, but there is enough good in Babel to make you appreciate these characters.The score is at times bleak and at times haunting, and always fits the mood appropriately. Inarritu completely deserves his praise for direction, weaving these four seemingly interrelated stories together and reminding you of the one single moment that set all of them in motion. The first storyline of two brothers is less gripping than the rest of the film, but serves as an important catalyst point of reference. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play a convincing married couple in the second storyline, with Pitt giving one of his most tortured performances since Se7en. Adriana Barraza is Pitt's nurse, and she forms the third storyline, of a woman who takes Pitt's babysat children to a Mexican wedding rather than miss it. Its a story that is extremely relatable but Barraza gives a very empathising performance and when her storyline goes sour, its 100% Barraza's talent that makes the low points feel believable. Rinko Kikuchi plays an undersexed, sexually frustrated deaf-mute teenager, in the vein of American Beauty, and Rinko's performance is simply spectacular. Bold, raw and demonstrating with great skill and subtlety the living hell that her character lives, Kikuchi is one of the most memorable parts of the film.Overall Babel is well-constructed, taught, emotional and features some spectacular acting performances from a mostly unknown cast. It is a far from comfortable film but also far from forgettable.",Babel

I think the Mexican nanny story was the most tense in the movie particular on the ill fated return from the wedding in Mexico and after events. Mexico is always depicted in movies as a nightmare, everytime. The Japanese story was very sad, the girl playing the deaf/mute school girl struggling to recover from the suicide of her mother who was mid 20s at the time of shooting was emotionally amazing. The Moroccan scenes with the cultural differences the boys shooting at the bus and wounding critically Cate Blanchett were tense and brilliantly filmed and acted. Through political red tape and delays Cate nearly died . Very absorbing movie and the running time just flew by. All stories are inter-related and all the actions have consequences.

148,jeremy3,Twice as good as Crash,6,18 January 2007,"I gave Crash a 3. I give this one a 6. Keep in mind, I find westerns entertaining, even if I don't agree with their message about white man's insecure desire to crush everything and everyone that interferes with their interests. The same can be said about this movie. Just like in Crash, I didn't agree with the political/racial/social objectives of this movie. However, it was more entertaining and at least a little more probable than Crash. What was good. I think the best of the three tales is the Japanese one, although I think in Japan the girl would have arrested and thrown in a loony bin (with their desire for conformity in Japan). You could really identify that this deaf girl was extremely beautiful, but was an outcast because of her deafness. The other two stories, at least introduced you to two cultures. The Egyptian story was in Arabic. It was entertaining. The message I don't agree with. Basically, it is a rather naive view about terrorism. Most kids are not that innocent in the Middle East. Terrorism is real, and children are taught to hate. However, it was still interesting, in that it showed somewhat what the ""backwoods"" of the Middle East are like. It also showed a spoiled American (Pitt), who dragged his reluctant wife (Blanchett) to Egypt. I agree even less with the third story about the Mexican maid. The American couple in Egypt (especially Pitt's character) irresponsibly left their child in the hands of a maid. In an ""emergency"" situation, the Mexican maid was forced to bring the white children she was tending to into Mexico. It was rather quaint, and gave you a picture of what rural Mexico is probably like. However, the movie got silly at the border crossing. If the maid had any sense, she would have known that bringing white children into Mexico could create a situation. If the border guards were that mean and nasty, they would have taken them out of the car, not giving the maid's son or nephew (not clear which) a chance to bail out. The desert fleeing from the authorities became ridiculous. If this maid was a native Indian of Mexico, she would know that you don't walk during the daytime in the desert. She would have stopped by the shady spot at night, and cut up a cactus for food and water. She acted more like a tourist than someone who originally illegally crossed into the U.S. That aside, I guess the filmmakers are trying to drench up further support to let all illegals into the U.S. As cruel as the border scene was, what else can one do when millions are illegally flooding the U.S.? However, political disagreements don't have to interfere with the movie. This movie was far more probable than Crash. If it were exactly like Crash, they would have attached the Mexican story to the Japanese tourist who gave a gun to an Egyptian. It would have completely hypothetical and ridiculous scenes. This movie was at least twice as good as Crash.",Babel

Iñárritu's Babel is a flawed but powerful piece of drama",8,29 April 2008,"Babel (2006) Top 10 - 2006 (Very minor spoilers)With many resemblances to 2005's superior Crash by Paul Haggis, Babel examines different human incidents across three continents in four different countries and how the shooting of an American woman in Morocco's desolate mountains triggered them.Babel is interesting but ties story on a level that you are likely to go 'Yeah right, what are the chances of this happening?', regardless the film is good enough to keep your attention for 140 minutes of commendable cinema filled with superb performances by the international cast which was rightfully acknowledged with Academy Award nominations - Adriana Barazza as the Mexican nanny and Rinko Kikuchi as the deaf-mute Japanese girl going through a difficult and challenging phase in her life. Praise must also go to Brad Pitt for a demanding and masterfully controlled performance along with the always consistent Cate Blanchett.I will not explain the whole puzzle like storyline, however I will say that Babel says something interesting about cultural divisions, language barriers, the value of human life and the commonest and most elemental things love, emotion and compassion.

150,Jay_Exiomo,Stands out with complex storytelling and superb performances,9,24 January 2007,"An American couple vacationing in Morocco; two Moroccan goatherd brothers; a Mexican woman and the two children she's taking care of; and a troubled Japanese teenager, are some of the main players in Alejandro González Iñárritu's poignant multi-narrative ""Babel,"" a film that's as complex as it is tragic.The third part of Iñárritu's ""trilogy"" (starting with ""Amores Perros,"" followed by ""21 Grams""), ""Babel"" focuses on how seemingly trivial events can have grand repercussions, and how humankind is alienated to one another by language and cultural barriers, while carefully examining its characters' flaws and their ability to cope up with their sufferings. With a single rifle bullet acting as a catalyst, Iñárritu and co-writer Guillermo Arriaga thrust the viewer into a rich palette of people that inhabit a compelling story where everybody is basically a victim of consequences. It's a melange of interrelated events that span three continents, yet feels mature and not at all coerced.Yussef (Boubker Ait El Caid) and his brother are given a rifle by their father so they can shoot jackals while tending goats up in the mountains of the Moroccan desert. But they take their shooting practice a bit too far when they target a tourist bus where Americans Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett) are among the passengers. Susan is hit and badly injured, and the events take on a global turn when the US government suspects terrorism. Meanwhile, their children Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble) are left alone back home with their nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza), an illegal immigrant from Mexico who's been staying in the US for 16 years. With no one else to look after the children while their parents are away, Amelia and her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) bring them along to Mexico while she attends her son's wedding. On what initially seems as an unrelated part of the story that takes place at the other side of the hemisphere, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) is a rebellious deaf-mute schoolgirl living in Tokyo with her father. She has since lost her mother and is struggling to find a meaningful connection among those around her.Obviously, Pitt and Blanchett are the marquee names of the film and both give excellent performances and still even in the heavily reduced screen time they're given with. (Granted that they're just a part of an entirety, but their story is where the whole film revolves.) Same with Barraza's portrayal of someone whose good intentions have gone wrong. But personally, it's the character of Chieko and Kikichi's portrayal of her that connects the most. (Maybe it has to do with my current ""affinity"" to the Japanese culture in general, but I digress... ) Her sense of isolation has the most emotional depth and is simply overwhelming.""Babel"" is a haunting tale that almost bests the director's previous two outings. While others may not warm up to Iñárritu's style of delivery and ultimately find the experience detaching, I personally think it's an emotionally rich tragedy that stands out with a complex storytelling and superb performances all throughout.",Babel

After having seen it, though, I have to say that it's not up to much.Don't get me wrong...this in an expertly made movie by a director who is obviously very talented. It's beautifully shot, excellently acted, and very atmospheric.That being said though, there's just wasn't enough here to really grab my interest. ""Babel"" tells various loosely interconnected stories, and in the mean time tries to make all kinds of supposedly relevant statements and observations about, cultural differences, the importance of family and the state of the world in general While the goal is laudable and while the director does make some good points, the overall message really isn't all that thought-provoking. for the most part, it's a clear case of stating the obvious.It also doesn't help that the plot feels very doctored to get the message across. The connections between the various stories are almost laughably far-fetched, and the individual stories themselves aren't that great either. The story about the Japanes girl is good, and could have made for a great movie just by itself, but the rest of the narratives left me fairly cold. Yes, it's all very bleak and depressing just like in Innaritu's previous movies, but here it just didn't move me very much.In the end, ""Babel"" is probably worth watching just because it's excellently made, but in the end I ended up with a movie that neither moved me nor really made me think 6 out of 10",Babel

It starts of in the desert but then leads you around the world and at first you don't think that the stories are inter-twined until the very last moment. In a way I guess it was torture for your mind because we all have felt , alone ,isolated and trapped and the sheer helplessness of it is portrait ed in such a way that it becomes difficult to put emotions into words . Brad Pitt was superb in this movie and made every moment of his screen time memorising , the Japanese school girl was brilliant as she showed a troubled soul trying to reach out for love as well as her suffering father . Babel should be viewed with an open mind and should be followed carefully but on the whole I felt this movie depicted being alone, and wanting to be close to someone and what people are willing to do to achieve that .BABEL 9.5 OUT 10 TO LOVE AND BE LOVED , ITS A WONDERFUL THING.

153,CineCritic2517,A nice ride,7,1 March 2007,"This movie is not your average art-house flick, nor is it the awesome 'sequel' to Magnolia (1999) which I at first hoped it would be. Nor did it outstand the highly overrated Crash (2004) story-wise. It pretty much stands on its own next to 21 Grams (2003) and Amores Perros (2000) also by Alejandro González Iñárritu with only 2 top star cameo's in a scenic tour around the world accompanied by one of the best soundtracks recently heard.Babel puts forth a string of unlucky and downright stupid decisions and its possible consequences. Yet I didn't feel any point in the movie came greatly across. On the contrary. Babel's tales are relentlessly bleak, feel contrived and are assembled 'just for the sake of' as separate stories into One. There is nothing overlapping the three stories other than stereotypical poor human behaviour and the rifle which eventually links them all together. I felt that this made the connection between the stories rather pointless (the same has been said about Magnolia) but not to a degree that ruined the movie in any way.Through powerful acting, great editing (sublimely taking turns on both long shots and fast paced ones) and a really amazing soundtrack*, the movie is still very enjoyable to a great number of moviegoers, including myself and still gets a well deserved 7 as far as I'm concerned. But recommended to see in the cinema for the cinematography and not on DVD as much of this film's merits will then pass by unnoticed.7/10* If not the movie, really listen to the soundtrack sometime :)",Babel
154,roland-104,Twisted narratives about our dangerous world,9,26 November 2006,"Iñárritu's latest ""web-of-life"" adventure film exhausts but also rewards the intrepid viewer. The connecting theme of Babel's three stories is the interplay of chaotic human encounters and the miscommunication that accompanies and further complicates such circumstances. ( 'Babel' - a noun meaning a confusion of voices and other sounds, or a scene of noise and confusion. 'Tower of Babel""Genesis 11:1-11  a tower built by Noah's descendants (probably in Babylon) who intended it to reach up to heaven; God foiled them by confusing their language so they could no longer understand one another.) This long, strenuous, and perhaps gratuitously complex drama sweeps the viewer back and forth to follow the unfolding of dangerous events in three locales: a barren Moroccan desert (sounding themes as disparate as terrorism and sibling rivalry); the California/Mexico border at Tijuana (Mexican illegals and the heartache of separation from family), and central Tokyo (teen-parent conflict, teen sexual longing, and the impact of suicide on survivors). Flashbacks sometimes overlap events occurring simultaneously in more than one locale. I felt confused for a while, and longed for Steven Soderbergh's viewer-friendly color coding of the various narratives in ""Traffic."" Did Iñárritu mean for us to be confused, the way I think Stephen Gaghan intended in ""Syriana,"" i.e., to have us experience the real chaos and ambiguity of the world in our times? Iñárritu's key film-making team members are involved. The sprawling screenplay is by Guillermo Arriaga (""Amores perros,"" ""Powder Keg,"" ""21 Grams,"" ""Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada""). The often stunning photography is set at the high standard we expect from cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""Fibra óptica,"" ""Amores perros,"" ""21 Grams,"" ""Frida,"" ""Brokeback Mountain), and excellent production design is provided by Brigitte Broch (""Amores perros,"" ""Powder Keg,"" ""Real Women Have Curves,"" ""21 Grams""). One of the editors, Stephen Mirrioni, has had great prior success in building very complex story sequences (""Clockwatchers,"" ""Traffic,"" ""Thirteen Conversations About One Thing,"" ""21 Grams,"" ""Oceans Eleven"" and ""Twelve,"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck"").The cast is huge and star studded. Some critics complain of wasted talent here because several of the roles played by big stars are foreshortened, rather minor. But they all fit together well. This is high priced ensemble acting, to be sure, but it is for the most part good acting. It works. There's a vivid sense of realism. Hey, if you've got the cash - and Iñárritu, as hot a director as you'll come across these days, has little trouble getting his films bankrolled  why not go for it! Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Gabriel Garcia Bernal, Adriana Barraza (""Amores perros""), Rinko Kikucki (""The Taste of Tea"") and Kôji Yakusho (""Shall We Dance,"" ""The Eel"") head up the ensemble. In spite of terminal gluteal fatigue, I found ""Babel"" spellbinding, believable and highly worth my effort to watch it.

The world is diminishing whether we like it or not and our population is expanding. Yet so much is misunderstood. How hard is it to reach out to one another?Alejandro González Iñárritu explores these issues of cross cultural understanding, or rather the lack of it, in his new disjointed form of storytelling in Babel, the third of his multi layered fractured, partial Mexican fables begun with Amores Perros (Love's a bitch) and 21 Grams. The most obvious thread is the notion that tragic consequences can arise from simple, but ignorant decisions. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are the American tourists on holiday in Morocco when an unfortunate incident befalls them and sets a series of lethal events in motion. Gael García Bernal (The Motorcycle Diaries) takes his Aunt from the U.S. to her sons wedding in Mexico, but rushed judgments will have a huge detrimental cost. However it is Rinko Kikuchi who plays the deaf mute Chieko, who delivers the most surprising performance, deserving her Oscar nomination. Many have argued over the relevance of this most dubious piece of the three stories but they have missed the point. Reaching out for understanding is the underlying feeling to the entire film and nowhere is it more evident than in this section. It is all Chieko seeks.Alejandro González Iñárritu isn't interested in spelling it out for the audience. He hopes they will argue it out afterward while he gets on with the task of making films that are intelligent with substance and that are relevant to the world we live in, especially at this juncture in time when we need to try and understand one another. The title comes from Genesis. After The Great Flood, the people from the Ark attempted to build a city and a tower whose top might reach Heaven, the Tower of Babel. But God was angry with the idea and made each person speak a different language which halted the plan and scattered the disconnected people across the earth.Alejandro is also a master of the edit. Not only does he love playing with structure, but his scenes have a superb rhythm and a certain style that can be hard hitting and yet introspective when he wants it to be. He is an artist, creating different moods within his tapestry while contemplating the overall work. The music of Gustavo Santaolalla (Brokeback Mountain) goes a long way to help convey the atmosphere. The two work together magnificently. Like the aforementioned films, Babel has a hand held style of camera-work, with many close-ups of his wonderful cast whom he manages to draw exceptional performances from. Brad Pitt is not afraid to let the gray hairs show and he hints at a varied range to come but it is his younger stars that draw the most emotion; the young Americans and their Moroccan counterparts.Alejandro doesn't pull any punches but no matter what your politic, this is one bout you will not want to miss.

Babel could've bombed in so many ways but director Alejandro González Iñárritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga (both also of '21 grams' fame) were really key in making this picture work. Once again, the tandem succeeds in educating Hollywood on how to create an emotionally powerful, visually stunning film that can also appeal to audiences worldwide because of its high relatability factor: the pain of being misunderstood.Babel tells of how the lives of seemingly disparate people from all over the world intertwine just by an accidental bullet shot: a couple of poor Moroccan shepherd boys and their family, a Japanese hunter and his teenaged deaf-mute daughter, an American tourist couple, and a Mexican nanny and her two American charges.The movie may be long, but you won't mind being taken for a ride. You won't get a chance to get bored because of the many stories that reel you in no matter how dangerously close to cliché they may be; Babel is very effective in showing the worst case scenarios of miscommunication and drives home the call for understanding and giving everyone the benefit of the doubt.Gonzalez is truly deserving of his Cannes outstanding director award for this film, and Babel illustrates his belief best on all movies he makes: |The film should explain itself. I feel that if you have to explain something it loses strength."" He had a great cast to work with, all emoting very naturally that you feel each character's pain (even Brad Pitt, who looked more like Benicio del Toro), only Cate Blanchett was the most underutilized of them all. So compelling and attuned is Arriaga's storytelling with Gonzalez's visuals that the dialogue only serves to enhance the pictures that beautifully, painfully unravel on screen.",Babel

A Japanese schoolgirl is desperate to lose her virginity.Director Alejandro González Iñárritu has done this kind of multi-linked, multi-character drama before with ""Amores Perros"" (which I liked a lot) and ""21 Grams"" (which I didn't).

Great performances by Rinko Kikuchi, Adriana Barraza and (surprise?) Brad Pitt. In fact, I think that this is probably Brad's best performance since ""Fight Club"" and the first film that I have seen him in recently in which he looks his age. (He's 43.

However thematic and symbolic as many will have this, I don't need any unnecessary, pretentious interpretation points; it's just instantly attention-snatching, emotionally heavy, and it keeps a shattering fever pitch of impending disaster all the way, aided by breathless acting and graphic visuals - the dialog is therefore thankfully restrained (OK, clue: the motif IS incommunication!). If you want to look at this, ""21 grams"" and ""Amores perros"" as a kind of trilogy, you could... but if so, it's the weakest of the lot, and the recipe of these types of work (Crash, Traffic, etc) is honestly somewhat threatening to wear out.

Alejandro González Iñárritu really did a great job of showing that people all around the world are similar, he chose drastically different people and backgrounds from various places from the world, that only enhance his message, in my opinion.Although the movie is in four different languages, it is comprehensive enough for a casual viewer to know what is going on at all times. It is not playing on the complexity of the plot, just randomly showing how one rifle gun can connect people from all over the world. If you think about it, there is nothing that exciting or unseen happening in the movie, but something makes it unique and interesting in its own way. If somebody would have described the movie to me as it looks at face value, i would never watch it.

To do this, he tells four different stories where characters find themselves in situations where they are not understood despite all their efforts to be. These stories stretch across the globe, from Tokyo to Mexico and center around an incident in Morocco that sparks an international scandal. Inarritu treats his imagery like poetry and has created a stunning picture with pacing that ranges from peacefully prophetic to tensely wrenching. But despite its unmitigated design, there is a larger irony undermining BABEL. It is a film concerned with the struggles faced when trying to get your point across that also wants to show how our lives are all connected yet its four story lines stretch to connect to each other and the point gets somewhat lost in that process. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play Richard and Susan, an American married couple on a sour vacation in Morocco. Their youngest child has just died of natural causes and they have come to try to forget. Instead, the guilt and anger they could not express at home has only become more prominent in their isolation. A stray bullet hits Susan in the shoulder while she glares out her tour bus window and her vacation goes from bad to potentially tragic. The unfolding of this scenario best exemplifies Inarritu's views on the frustration that often goes alongside communication. A desperately frightened Richard must get his wife medical attention in a town without a hospital and where no one speaks his language. He finds one tour guide who carries him through the experience, facilitating his translation. Speech is not his only barrier as this small Moroccan village's medical treatment is far from what Richard is accustomed to in his privileged life at home in California. He then runs into trouble where one would not expect him to. He is unable to convey the seriousness of his wife's condition to the remaining tour bus passengers, most of them American. He requires their support but they don't listen to a word he says, focusing solely on their own needs, some selfish and some reasonable. As Richard is rightfully focused on his wife's needs, he isn't listening to them either and arguments ensue. Richard's communicative difficulties also extend to one other person, Susan. Writer Guillermo Arriaga brings us to the most intimate frustration with understanding here when these two people require a brush with death to get them to be quiet enough to hear how afraid each other is and how responsible each feels for the death of their child.The remaining plots branch out from this incident but whereas the execution of the plights is poignantly told, the connections themselves are weak or vice versa. Richard and Susan's children run into trouble of their own when their Mexican Nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza) takes them over the border so that she can attend her son's wedding. When reentering the United States, the border patrol are suspicious and begin asking many questions. Amelia does not have difficulties speaking English but does not answer their questions as well as she should. The film loses some focus here, as the patrollers' approaches are more racist in nature than anything else. Whereas racism is certainly another form of fear and misunderstanding, this dire situation feels easily unavoidable and contrived to serve the film's purpose. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, a deaf and mute teenage girl deals with the loss of her mother and fights to be heard when she can't make any noise. Cheiko is played by Rinko Kikuchi; it is a vibrant and commanding performance. She herself cannot hear what others are trying to say and is limited in how she can communicate her own feelings and desires. Her struggle is only intensified by her lack of physical connection to other people, as she is an aggravated virgin. All of her attempts to entice are thwarted by her silent aggression and her incapacity to get anyone to hear her is heartbreaking. In many ways, her storyline is the most effective but it is only tied to the whole of the film because her father's rifle was used in Susan's shooting in Morocco. The word ""babel"" finds its roots in an association to the Hebrew verb ""balal,"" which means to confuse or confound. Hence, when someone is said to be babbling, they are not communicating their point properly, just spewing out a bunch of unnecessary words that end up being entirely pointless. All of Inarritu's words and images are carefully chosen and constructed in a concise fashion that is on many levels successful, but by trying to get across so much, he ends up narrowly but sadly missing his own point.",Babel
161,screenwriter-14,BABEL=An Important Global Story of Relevance,10,11 November 2006,"From the first frame of BABEL in north Africa, to the last scene in Tokyo, this film is relevant on so many levels; of course, language, and the importance of language, but more importantly BABEL is a film which shows an audience the power of communicating and listening to what others have to say, and interpreting that message so that others will understand exactly what is relevant and important.Many have said BABEL reminds them of CRASH, with interconnecting stories and characters, but BABEL really shows on a global level what can happen when people collide and need to communicate their needs and fears to others. Brad Pitt gives an outstanding performance as not only the husband, but as the ""angry American"" in a foreign land screaming at others to move faster. Cate Blanchett is once and again magnificent in her role, as well as the supporting cast and especially the young children transported for a festive occasion to Mexico which leads to a nightmare, along with the young north African children and our deaf mute Japanese young woman, who all communicate through BABEL their fears and desires.BABEL will stay in my mind for a very long time and is the most powerful film which I have seen this year. BABEL demands a global audience to take a look around them, beyond the current problems in the middle east and with immigration issues in the United States, and to listen to the rich dialog of BABEL and the connecting stories to realize what is happening in this world.",Babel
162,PCT1970,"Innaritu's ""Triology Of Death""",7,7 May 2019,"Inarritu's helms a substantial third film in his, ""Trilogy of Death"" series. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, score and acting. All the actors involved deliver considerable performances. Pitt, Blanchett, Bernal and Barraza are superb. The plot revolves around a gunshot that intertwines four different storylines. The plot takes place across three continents with difficult stories involving two young goatherds, two vacationing Americans, a deaf Japanese girl and her father and a Mexican nanny who takes some liberties with the children she has cared for since they were infants. The film scrutinizes the differences and lack of communication within the stories. It's examination proves how cultural differences and communication can be elusive, crucial and become an obstacle for survival. Eventually all four storylines and characters are tied together and come full circle. The plot is intense, thrilling, gritty, clever, unique and cathartic. The film is heartwrenching, memorable and has a superlative ending as well as being a great ending in the trilogy. It is an ingenious film in the drama / thriller genre.",Babel
163,Rathko,Not Half As Meaningful As It Thinks It Is,6,30 November 2006,"I wish I could tell you to just go read my review of 'Crash' but IMDb's 10-line rule prevents me from doing so. So here we go, then: The stories are incredibly simplistic, with barely enough content to satisfy a 45 minute TV show  father gives his kids a gun, they accidentally shoot somebody and are arrested by the police; a woman is shot and her husband waits for help to arrive; housekeeper takes kids to wedding in Mexico and gets lost in desert crossing back over the border; Japanese teenager wanders around Tokyo without underwear. That's it. Whatever complexity 'Babel' possesses is the result of the random intercutting of these stories, not from the individual stories themselves. The fact is that you could take three random Janet and John 'plots' and cut them together to provide the illusion of post-modern deconstructed complexity. It's the cinema equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes, and for some reason, every critic in town is happy to marvel at the new duds.Like 'Crash', 'Babel' is an actor's movie. It gives them an opportunity to cry and rage and play vulnerable and desperate, which all involved do very well. Brad Pitt gets to pull a Charlize Theron and play 'ugly' for Oscar consideration - graying hair, bags under the eyes, and crow's-feet. The lengths some actors will go to for their art! But the emotional hysteria, which Inarritu cranks up to outrageous proportions, is allowed to replace character development. Few characters actions seem rational, many are completely irrational, and you don't feel any connection to their plight beyond the fleeting sympathy for a sad looking face.But it's this kind of sappy, over-emotional, manipulative storytelling that the Academy loves to get behind. Actors love it because it features the kind of roles they'd all kill for. Director's love it for its liberal, multinational, lets-all-hold-hands theorizing. Producers love it because it reinforces their belief that foreign accents, playing 'ugly' and crying a lot wins awards.Inarritu has a lot of talent, but it seems wasted on a self-indulgent and vaguely teenage-Goth-activist obsession with the cruelty and injustice of the world. It's a far better film than the risible nonsense that was 'Crash', but it falls a long way short of the praise being heaped on it by many critics.Expect it to win, however, several Oscars.",Babel
164,seaview1,BABEL's Microcosm of the World,8,3 November 2006,"With a plot structure not unlike his previous Amores Perros or 21 Grams, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga have created Babel, the final act of a trilogy about the human condition. With seemingly unrelated characters and story lines that gradually merge, it is as ambitious as a narrative can get, and the filmmakers pull it off with great aplomb.Four parallel stories take place within days if not hours of each other. In Morocco, the father of a goat herding family buys a rifle from a neighbor. Set to guard the flock from predators, his two sons decide to do some target practice. As a tour bus happens by, a single shot rings out, and a careless act will create havoc and distress for innocent victims and have severe repercussions for others. In the bus, an American couple, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), are having a marital crisis when all of a sudden their world is turned upside down. The tour bus stops at a remote village as the passengers begin to stir and fear for their own safety. As the Moroccan police investigate the incident, Richard is desperate to save the life of his wife amid primitive surroundings in a foreign land. The couple's two children in California are under the care of their nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), who is anxious to go to her son's impending wedding. After failing to find suitable caregivers to watch over the children, she takes them with her to Mexico. Escorted by her volatile nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), they drive to a festive wedding ceremony and reception. Afterwards, they are stopped at a border checkpoint where events turn nightmarish. In Japan, a lonely teenaged girl, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) who is deaf, hangs with her other deaf friends and dreams of flirting and connecting with a male even if it means compromising her dignity. Her father, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho) is inadequate as a parent since his wife died under obscure circumstances. As detectives want to question Yasujiro, Cheiko is smitten by a younger detective and unleashes a torrent of passion and secrets.The final moments of the film are memorable as each storyline becomes clearer and potent in their revelations and truths. Time slips back and forth and certain events catch up to the others (Christopher Nolan's Momento comes to mind). The threads that connect the different stories are not as obvious as one might expect and when they do become apparent, they hold emotional meaning. What is so remarkable is how a seemingly innocent prank sets off a chain reaction of angst and responsibility. The film does not sermonize but rather it presents the events as they happen albeit in an incongruent time frame. You experience life and its effects on other events and people. The director and writer try to depict people like you or me with the same needs or longings. With a setting that reaches the far-flung corners (Japan, Mexico or Morocco) of the world, Inarritu has forced his audience to go with him and face a myriad of characters that speak English, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, Berber, or French! Yet when we get to know these disparate individuals and their situations, we begin to empathize and care for them despite their faults or shortcomings. Although the title has biblical references with its different languages, these stories share common emotional bonds that transcend mere dialects. This is a film that could easily play anywhere in the world and still be affecting.The international cast melds amateurs with seasoned veterans and the honest performances are completely captivating and affecting. I dare anyone to pick out the professional actors from the non professionals (save Pitt and Blanchett). This use of unknowns adds to the believability of the whole storyline. (It is ironic that Michael Pena plays a border policeman; he was featured in last year's similarly structured Crash-a coincidence perhaps?)There are painful, agonizing moments where human suffering is brought with unflinching, explicit realism to an almost unbearable level. This film presents characters with all their strengths and weaknesses and it does so unsparingly. Sometimes the punishment or consequences unfairly outweigh the crime or the mistake. The brothers who watch over their father's goats must face their own culpability and ugly family secrets that threaten to destroy their way of life. There are Richard and Susan who are at the center or eye of a growing hurricane of life's cruel randomness and must depend on strangers for survival. A jaunt across a Mexican border turns ugly.Things are not wrapped up nicely, and several plot threads are left hanging and open-ended on purpose. The marital problems of Richard and Susan are never clearly delineated and their relationship gets short shrift even as they go through a harrowing event. The music is somber and spare. The imagery is powerful despite the hand-held documentary feel. The scenes of Japanese nightlife are vivid and disturbing in their portrayal of urban youth.Babel is about how families are torn apart and come together. It is also about children. It could be your children or mine or the world's children. There are some significant issues (racial tension, illegal immigrants, adolescent yearnings, perceptions of a foreign country, and the arrogance of the 'ugly American') the filmmakers touch upon and you wish they had gone even farther with the material, but you are glad they went as far as they did. Babel is a film that this reviewer has no desire to sit through again, but having gone through it once, it is a unique, remarkable experience. This is an imperfect, significant film and destined for major Oscar nominations.",Babel
165,debblyst,"So it's not original -- but it IS powerful, moving, disturbing and a directorial tour-de-force",9,26 January 2007,"People criticize ""Babel"" because its fragmented, interwoven structure is not ""original"". Well, of course it isn't -- films have been experimenting with multiple, fragmented story-telling as far back as Griffith's ""Intolerance"" (1916)!! If this structure is now mainstream (Altman's work, Manchevski's ""Before the Rain"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Magnolia"", ""Crash"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Traffic"", Iñárritu +Arriaga's previous ""Amore Perros"" and ""21 Grams"", etc) it's a sign of the times: isn't fragmented information our daily routine? Isn't TV-zapping the most consolidated of our ""modern"" habits? ""Babel""'s structure is not SUPPOSED to be original -- it just employs 21st century's daily language, as the 1940s used flashbacks. Others criticize how contrived the script is in its struggle to inter-connect everything, and it's true that writer Guillermo Arriaga's obsession with complex geometric story-telling is overly ambitious and occasionally stiffening, though it's still stimulating -- would you rather have a linear plot? Some others (mainly from the U.S.) complain that Mexican director Iñárritu took U.S. money to attack U.S. foreign and immigration policies, media and police -- as if criticizing America ought to be the exclusive prerogative of U.S. filmmakers. But they forget ""Babel"" criticizes everything: Japanese society's rigid code of behavior, impersonal formality and sexual repression under the glossy, state-of-the-art ""modernity""; Mexican culture's machismo, dependence on US economy and tolerance with irresponsible let-and-let-live behavior (life-affirming though it may be, but watch what happens to Amelia); Arabic culture's violence (what about Moroccan police methods?), intolerable sexism and (again) sexual repression; white bourgeois Europeans' self-righteous, snob, racist and patronizing demeanor.And I could add yet another criticism: that ""Babel"" is ultimately a conservative film as it puts family values above everything else, in each of the four stories (Iñárritu even maudlinly dedicates the film to his own children, ""the brightest lights in the darkest nights""). That notion of family über alles, as the solution-for-the-world's-malaises is highly debatable, of course: families have been around forever and everywhere in many shapes and sizes, and the world just keeps getting more violent and unfair, and people lonelier and unhappier.Despite all that (!) ""Babel"" still manages to be profoundly thought-provoking and moving, to me at least. Maybe because I can still connect and sympathize when I see people (even in fiction) panic as their best intentions turn into terrible misunderstandings or stupid actions with life-shattering consequences. Maybe because I've known fear, prejudice, arrogance, irresponsible behavior and unrequited love/desire. Maybe because I wasn't put off by unimportant technicalities such as an awkward trajectory of a bullet. And because I marveled at director Iñárritu's towering tour-de- force as he re-shaped the fatalism and the blocked geometry of Arriaga's screenplay into a looser, more musical, richer mosaic of pictorial greatness, multi-layered emotions and human solidarity. While Arriaga waits for fate to strike mercilessly, Iñárritu inserts little moments to make us empathize with his characters' flawed but unmistakable humanity (with few exceptions that are beyond ""salvation"", like the US and Moroccan police, the insufferable British tourist, the international media).""Babel"" may be a ""downer"", but many of its highlights are life-affirming moments: the virtuoso Japanese night-club scene, where Iñárritu's mise-en- scène is so thrilling (a homage to his early days as DJ?) and the music so entrancing (I want that ""September"" remix!) you'll feel like trying an e-pill next time you go dancing. There's magic in the short, breathtakingly beautiful flashback of Yussef and Ahmed testing their body balance against the Moroccan desert wind (happiness can be found in simple things) and in the whole Mexican wedding sequence with its celebration of life, love, sex, food, dance, music and laughter. Iñárritu extracts uniformly great performances from the mixed international cast (from experienced pros such as Cate Blanchett and Adriana Barraza to amateur first-timers such as the Moroccan boys) which attests his impressive talent with actors. He also knows how to choose his collaborators: Rodrigo Prieto's excellent cinematography (that night shot of the helicopter against the Casablanca background!), Douglas Crise+Stephen Mirrione's never-confusing editing, and Gustavo Santaolalla's soulful music are huge contributions.""Babel"" is certainly a painful cinematic experience; it's almost traumatizing in its surgical investigation of 21st century Weltschmerz. But behold the haunting finale as the camera flies back from Chieko's sky-high balcony to reveal Tokyo's crushing hugeness: the fact that someone who cannot speak or hear and who's repeatedly rejected still insists on her effort to communicate, in this world where words have become expendable, cheap, misleading (and people rarely listen anyway) isn't just ironic; it felt provocative, defying, alive. ""Babel"" is an astoundingly accomplished, (perhaps too) ambitious, thankfully controversial, deeply moving film that never lets its virtuosity tower over its emotional goals. A must-see.",Babel
166,arthera09,too much to talk about,9,13 June 2007,"The making of this movie was a massive undertaking. The scope of what they director and write wanted to do was huge. They wanted to do everything. My room mate who I watched this with who is usually very good with movies was confused by parts of it and it was totally understandable. I will say one of my favorite things about the movie is the chronology. It does not match at all and Brad Pitt's performance at the end was actually very good. Very few of the actors had much time to show off what they had but Rinko and the women who played Amelia both made themselves felt on screen. Rinko especially. The last scene with Amelia was really good, but I feel as if Rinko was perfect. I will say before I focus on part with Rinko that I feel as if the part with the border patrol seemed as if it did not quite fit. The commentary was obvious and the tie in with what was happening with the parents made it seem a little over the top. At first I was like what the hell is her nephew doing but I understand now. THe only part that made that part relevant was the addition of the kids and the fact that the kids were in danger. Everything going on in Moracco was pretty obvious and I think the best part was how the act of terrorism was no more than a kid with a rifle playing around with his brother. The best part was the part involving Rinko and it dealt with suicide, sexuality, acceptance and was not politically driven. I thought Rinko pulled off the vulnerable deaf girl perfectly and I love how she was fearless as an actress. I feel as if they could have based an entire movie on her and I almost wished they did. The simple tie-in's between the three stories really gives us an idea of how closely related we are all to each and other makes the world a little bit smaller.",Babel
167,wavecat13,Trying desperately to be understood,10,25 April 2019,"Inarritu is a great director and this is one of his best films. There are 3 separate stories that turn out to be tangentially connected. In one, an American tourist is shot in rural Morrocco (accidentally it turns out, by a couple of kids), and her husband tries desperately to get her medical help. Meanwhile the couple's kids are taken over the border to Mexico for a wedding by their nanny and (not surprisingly) some trouble develops. In the third, a teenage deaf mute clumsily tries to express her sexuality in a world (sleek, hip Tokyo) in which she is an outsider. The stories are tied together by the theme of characters struggling to be understood and to make the connections they need. The acting is low key and just right.

168,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,"An abrasive story, narrated by four different points of view.",7,18 October 2018,"''Babel'' is a truly heartbreaking film and those who see entertainment as directly linked to enjoyment should be warned. Apart from the overall sad dimension of the movie, Alejandro G. Iñárritu follows an interesting narrative technique, following the lives of people scattered around the globe (Morocco, Japan, U.S.A., and Mexico), four different stories which converge at the end. The main theme of ''Babel'' is (broken) communication between people from different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, hence the title, and Iñárritu attempts to depict people with emotional and behavioral weaknesses as their common denominator fighting to express themselves and longing for understanding from their fellow humans. The performances by the shining cast are all above average, with Brad Pitt and Gael García Bernal being the best. There is nothing wrong with this film but as I said above it is not easy to digest, especially the Japanese deaf-mute storyline is almost melodramatic, and many people will give a low rating due to this fact. There is perhaps a glimmer of hope in the end but this cannot change the total devastating feeling that this film transmits to the viewer.",Babel
169,oshram-3,Reach exceeds its grasp,4,13 November 2006,"From the outset, Babel looks high concept and high-powered; we see Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett prominently featured in the ads, and we are shown various people speaking in various languages, the idea being that our differences in communicating cause us problems.And while that premise does underwrite the whole film, ultimately it's not really enough to tie the disparate stories together. At the center of the film we have the plot line with Pitt and Blanchett where Blanchett is accidentally shot in the ass-end middle of nowhere in Morocco. Here communications breakdowns definitely play a part, as Pitt must rely on his tour guide (who very selflessly abandoned the bus tour to help him) to arrange for medical aid for his wife. His language barriers cause him a problem at home, too, where his Hispanic housekeeper Amelia (Adriana Barraza) is torn between doing her duty watching his two children and missing her son's wedding in Mexico. When she decides to merge the two and take the children with them, you just know there will be complications. And finally we follow the story of Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a teen-aged Japanese girl who is deaf mute. Her story, while a keener riff on the underlying concept, is only very thinly related to the main plot, and ends up being a film pretty much all unto its own.Babel tries to follow the Traffic/Crash formula of disparate plots and sometimes out-of-sequence storytelling, but the key problem here is that the pieces never come together. Each story is in itself reasonably interesting, but their tenuous connections never really work, and so instead of one movie, you get four smaller ones (there's also the story of the young boy who accidentally shot Blanchett), some of which work better than others. It also doesn't help that Chieko's plot, obviously the furthest removed from the 'main' story, also overshadows the others to a great degree. Her story is so much more unique and compelling than anyone else's that as the film went on I began to get impatient when we would switch back to one of the other three far less captivating stories.Babel isn't by any stretch a bad film, and the performances are mostly strong, but don't count on seeing much of the powerhouse stars: Pitt and Blanchett are part of a large ensemble and get perhaps the smallest amount of screen time of the four parts. Rinko Kukuchi pretty much steals the show from everyone else, and again, her plot is so interesting after a while I began to wonder why they just didn't make a two-hour movie about her and scrap the other, lesser plots. That would have been leagues more satisfying than the confused, chaotic film that resulted. And yes, I understand that a lack of understanding leads to stress and chaos, but that point should have been contained to the story of the film and not allowed to flow over to its structure. You can easily get too artsy, and sadly, Babel does.",Babel
170,joestank15,Bit of a let-down.,7,4 January 2007,"At long last, Babel. As anyone who sees me on a regular basis knows, I have waited a long time to see this movie. This is one case where the wait was not worth the product.Babel - The film is four vaguely interconnected vingettes, the primary one involving a woman (Cate Blanchett) who is shot by a rifle while on on vacation in the Moroccan desert and her husband (Brad Pitt). However, both of these actors seem to be used primarily for their namedraw, as neither is given much to do acting wise. It's nice not to see Brad Pitt play a cornball Clooney lackey or secret agent smoothy to Angelina Jolie, but he has little to do beyond being the desperate concerned husband, while Cate Blanchett screams, bleeds and pees. We've come a long way from looking spookily serene and omniscient in the Lord of the Rings movies, haven't we?The other vignettes are better. The story I found the most interesting and disturbing was the one set in Japan that was the least connected to any of the other stories. It was interesting and different to have a deaf-mute Japanese girl as the protagonist, and the use of music and the lack of it was perhaps the most interesting card the film had to play. It's such a fish out of water experience to go from people talking in Spanish to Arabic to Japanese.I've heard a few blurbs about this film here and there. My mother thought the film was ""better than Crash."" Now that I've seen it, I highly disagree. Crash had a message to make. Babel really doesn't. It has interesting plot points and situations, but nearly all of the ""surprises"" are rather predictable and dreary. Crash had moments of feeling to go with it's sadness, whereas Babel is just rather depressing, and all of the plots are in a downward spiral from the get-go. Also, for four short stories, Babel is rather long, and you feel it near the last hour. Howvever, both films have a strong ensemble cast.Babel is a beautiful film conceptually and musically, and it's nice to see a movie that's a couple of A-list stars away from being a foreign film and still getting so much attention.

Too often a scene stayed around when it didn't need to. We got it. Move on. I would say this movie is more about pain and the helplessness that comes with not being able to do anything about it right away. The rifle shot caused a lot of pain for some people in the countries mentioned and understanding it all was not easy, hence the title Babel. Maybe.Not a lot of dialogue from Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett who are husband (Richard) and wife (Susan), and not a lot was needed. We knew what was going on. This was very well acted by all. One of their kids, Debbie, is another Fanning, this time Elle Fanning, so the Fanning Dynasty begins. And, yes, Elle did good. Not a lot of dialogue here, too, but we knew what was going on.Because many scenes were too long when they didn't need to be it is hard to give a rousing recommendation for this movie. Kind of dragged at times because of it. It is what it is, but if many scenes where shorter, the movie would have had more impact, I believe, and then I could give a rousing recommendation.

But screenwriter Arriaga and Iñárritu do not fail in this, their problem lies somewhere else. I thought, that every storyline was really good and ""Babel"" was definitely a touching and also quite depressing film, but sometimes all this severity of fate is a little bit over the top and a small dose of humour would have bettered the effect. But, of course, there is also this absolutely stunning international cast, which has the ability to weigh up for very much.

176,flapdoodle64,Long and pretentious.,4,5 February 2007,"This film is well crafted and many of the performances are good, but this business of giving the audience 4 or so completely different stories tenuously connected by some plot device has become a pretentious cliché. I remember how it seemed fresh in 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Traffic,' 'Syrianna,' 'Crash,' etc. But 'Pulp Fiction' was more than 10 years ago, and these films of supposedly interlocking stories have now exhausted my good will.There needs to be 10 year moratorium on movies with 3 or more plot lines supposedly interconnected with a single plot device. Seriously.I think in this movie the device serves to conceal the fact that this is an oppressively sad film that, paradoxically, seems empty and soulless. Perhaps if the film had been about 1 hour and 20 minutes shorter, it might have seemed to have a point.Realistic, yes. But truthfully, if I just want to be saddened by the dreadful realities of the modern world, I'll watch a documentary instead.",Babel
177,Panterken,Great but can't live up to Iñárritu's previous films.,6,19 June 2007,"Babel is the newest Iñárritu film. Iñárritu brought us 'Amores Perros'and '21 Grams' in the past and he presents Babel as the final part of the trilogy. Babel starts of very slow with only one event to entertain us during the first half of the movie. The narrative isn't that strong. A lot of screen time is used to create atmosphere. And besides trying very hard the atmosphere doesn't come across as strong as Iñárritu intended. The silent moments bored me very much and I can imagine an unpracticed drama viewer has even more trouble dealing with that than me. The most important element of a drama should be the message, which was put forward brilliantly in Amores Perros and 21 Grams but Babel is a movie desperately searching for a message.Babel is not a total disaster, it does deliver some memorable scenes that provide insight in Mexican, Morrocan and Asian Culture. The movie is very serene ( a welcome change from the never ending stream of Hollywood glamour) and Pitt in particular delivers an unbelievable performance, he shows that he's really got a great range. Blanchett's performance was watchable but she still has to convince me of her great acting skills. I've seen a lot of her movies and I'm still not convinced at all.In conclusion, Babel is worth watching but isn't nearly as good as Amores Perros or 21 Grams.",Babel
178,masterjk2,Psycho-BABEL,4,8 June 2008,"This movie could have been good. But it wasn't. Where should I start? When Blanchette asks Pitt ""Why are we here?"" He can't answer. Why would any young, bright, wealthy American tourists be on an old timers bus, looking at barren desert? To get shot of course. OK, so disregard that. Cate gets shot. Pitt takes the advice of the tour guide and they take her to his village to get sown up by the local vet. Well, that's a break. So do they try to get her to civilization (the bus must go to some large city to park and wait for more suckers.) No! Pitt wants to wait and maybe let her bleed to death while they wait for an ambulance! Hey, what's wrong with the Star Ship Enterprise. OK, we'll forget that. Days pass and a helicopter is finally dispatched to take Cate to the local Emergency Care clinic. Brad tries to hand a wad of dollars to the guide, the one who lives in a mud hut, with no furniture, running water and a daughter who may be starving for all we know. He refuses Brad's largess! What a minute. What planet is this? Is there any part of this segment that bears any semblance to reality? Part 2... we have the Mexican nanny who can't get away to her son's wedding. Of course, it's an important day for her. But she's in the country illegally and she decides to take the two blond haired children across the border with her. How did she ever plan to get back? They always ask Mexicans for papers and with two children clearly not hers, it's a sure bet. I can't believe that Brad and Cate could possibly have left their children for years with anyone that incredibly stupid. Reality check. As for the segment about the goat herders... who knows. Maybe that's the way they live and think. They have virtually no money. So when the father buys the gun for 500 dirhams (about $69.00) and a goat, one would think he would be very careful about the 300 bullets he got. Where will he get more? How will he pay for them? Oh, no, he sends the kids off to shoot jackals or a can or whatever...with no supervision or even a warning about make every bullet count. So they go off and shoot rocks, the ground and a bus. Are people, the entire family, really that stupid and so uncaring of their own well being? And finally, the Japanese segment. For some unknown reason a wealthy Japanese businessman has given his expensive rifle to his hunting guide (were they hunting jackals or goats for nothing else seems extant in that area?) OK, lets assume that he was allowed to bring the gun into the country... many countries are very picky about that. Then suppose he was stupid enough, this wealthy man, to give the gun to a native (why not just a tip? It could be illegal to give someone a gun there.) Now, how would he get out of the country? Most countries want to know what happened to any arms you brought into the country if you're not taking it out. OK, OK, let's assume he's incredibly stupid and does that. Why do we have to watch his deaf mute daughter try to come to terms with her adolescent sexuality. For the most part, it was repulsive. This isn't a very good movie, but he sure has the smoke machine working full time because a lot of reviewers couldn't see past the mirror. Acting? Well Brad played Brad, Cate played Cate... I guess the kids and the nanny played themselves. The Moroccans were probably hired in the desert. But Bernal did shine, as usual. He's a fine actor.",Babel
179,teh_mode,"Self-important, ropey and fairly unrealistic, Babel is never the less an intriguing, well acted and thought-provoking piece of work",6,15 February 2007,"After crashing through our cinema with his fantastically raw debut Amores Perros (2000), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu lost his sense of humour, but none of his directorial flair, with the much more bleak (and then a bit more worthy) 21 Grams (2003). Now, he takes that earnestness, and self-importance and absolutely unleashes it onto an even more agonising experience with Babel. Already nominated for more awards then I care to notice, it tells the multiple stories, all roped together looser than a ship tied to a dock with dental floss, set among the backdrops of Tokyo, Mexico, North Africa and California. A Moroccan farmhand buys a rifle to protect his sheep from jackals. He gifts his children with the opportunity of testing the said weapon, and they proceed to miss everything they aim at. Standing a top a rocky mountain, they view a coach come into view. One of the kids thinks he can hit it from where is, so shoots directly at it. Little do they know, that this shot would have global repercussions, echoing throughout the globe. We join the recipient of the bullet in the coach, played by Cate Blanchett, as she is travelling with her husband (Pitt) around Morocco for reasons that are never really made clear. Meanwhile, their kids are being looked after in California by Mexican babysitter Amelia, who is desperate to attend her son's wedding in her native country. After failing to find a suitable sitter for the children she throws caution to the wind and takes them with her to the ceremony. We are then whisked off to Japan, for reasons which appear entirely obscure until late in the movie. A deaf girl named Chieko (Kikuchi) attempts to cope with the struggle of communicating on society's levels. Her father is absent, and her mother has committed suicide.Babel is not without merit. There are some truly affecting moments, particularly involving Pitt and Blanchett when, after being transported to a small Moroccan village, she agonises over her excruciating bullet wound. The story is ambitious, and like all of Inarritu's films, it will have you debating its subject matter for weeks. But when a filmmaker spews out a story with this much self-importance, particularly when large chucks of the story are quite melodramatic and frankly unrealistic, your tolerance of his self-aggrandising becomes razor thin. Indeed the Japanese story is connected to the others so loosely, you wonder why the hell it is included. Babel is intriguing stuff, but far too self-worthy to win over your acclaim.",Babel
180,thisissubtitledmovies,keeps you on your toes,8,3 December 2010,"excerpt - Talented director Alejandro González Iñarritú and writer Guillermo Arriaga score a hat trick with Babel, the much anticipated follow-up to their blockbusters Amores Perros and 21 Grams. The Mexican duo continue with their now defining approach of using multiple characters, story lines and now multiple timeframes to make a point about humanity on a grand scale, partly reminiscent of 2005's Oscar-winning, love-it-or-hate-it, Crash.Babel deals with so many different themes; some action-packed, some smile- worthy and some that can't help but tug on your heart strings. The director deserves credit for the way he portrays the contrasting emotions and constantly keeps the viewer on their toes as to how the stories will develop. It is compulsive viewing, and is sure not to disappoint the procrastinators among us.",Babel
181,ligonlaw,The Movie Was Better than the Reviews,8,1 January 2007,"""Babel"" has received mixed reviews. The movie uses a device that is becoming more common. ""Crash,"" ""Blue,"" ""Red,"" and ""White"" and ""13 Coversations about One Thing"" all tell stories about people who are connected in a loose way. The lives of the people in ""Babel"" are all connected even though the stories take place in Japan, Mexico, Morroco and San Diego.The stories are all fascinating and edgy. The characters are interesting and likable. Following the several plot lines has been reviewed as a difficult task. I disagree. Most of the films mentioned earlier use a circle of people who are drawn together by a theme like racism. The films illustrate cause and effect: how one event has an impact on someone else at a later time.""Babel"" uses a not-so-subtle object which has an effect on everyone. It is not hard to follow. Reviewers can be wrong, and this is a good movie which is better than the reviews.",Babel

It stunning images, excellent acting and amazing stories that have a very ""irrelevant"" connecting object. But what is most stunning about this movie is that it connects the lives of people in different countries/continents and show the contrasts in peoples perception of reality. From he fear the Americans have for the villagers so they are even afraid to leave the buss, to the youths of Japan with all there technology, the flamboyant Mexicans, to the simple lives of the people in the Arabic mountainsThe contrasts makes one wonder about the live on this planet and think about ones own perception of reality",Babel
183,eastbergholt2002,Film about Globalization,9,11 March 2007,"I enjoyed Babel, it's a clever and thought provoking movie. It features inter-connected stories involving: a family of goat herders, American tourists in Morocco, a Mexican nanny living illegally in California and a disturbed Japanese girl. The characters endure harrowing situations and the film is shot in the documentary style favored by Soderbergh in Traffic.Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett) are an affluent American couple who take a vacation in Morocco to improve their troubled marriage. A young goat-herder fires a rifle at a tourist bus hitting Susan. While she is bleeding on a dirt floor in a primitive village, her rescue is caught up international politics as the U.S. attempts to lecture the Moroccan government about the need to fight terrorism at home. In California, Brad and Susan's children are cared for by their maid, Amelia. Amelia is desperate to attend her son's wedding in Mexico, but is unable to find someone to look after the children, so she takes them with her. After the wedding, she is driven back to San Diego by a drunken nephew. During a police chase he drops Amelia and the kids in the desert. Meanwhile in Tokyo, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) is a rebellious teenager prone to outrageous behavior. Her frustration with life is compounded by deafness and the recent death of her mother. Chieko's connection to the story is revealed at the end of the film. The film shows a global class system where the world cares about what happens to Americans and less about Moroccans and Mexicans. The goat-herders are brutalized by their own police, and the Mexicans are viewed with suspicion and contempt by the U.S. border patrol. The film wants us to sympathize with the underdogs. The acting, cinematography and editing are superb. The direction by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and script from Guillermo Arriagais are excellent.",Babel
184,thomvic,Impressive performances and captivating story.....,8,27 April 2011,"From the director of 21 Grams, I sort of knew what to expect knowing the director's passion for telling stories on human emotions, the connection between all of us that we probably don't see most of the time in real life. And I loved 21 Grams for bringing all that out.Babel dwells into the themes of how one tragic event can impact on the lives like a chain reaction to other people, regardless of how far apart we are. This is a film that doesn't separate people based on languages, but rather connects them and makes it all about what it is that binds us together - hope, guilt, pain and desperation.To really go into the plot line will take a lot of time but all I will say is that the accidental shooting of an American woman while on holiday with her husband in Morocco leads to a chain of events that are interlinked and lead to desperate situations. The main characters are:1. The American couple in Morocco 2. The two young boys in Morocco 3. The housekeeper who is taking care of the American couples kids back home 4. The Japanese girl who is deaf and whose father is linked to the eventsI will comment that the scenes in Japan are probably the least connected in terms of the main story and you could say even could have been a story on its own for a movie. But what this film makes you think about is how small the world really is. It's a film about compassion and our need to help when we are in difficult situations. Sometimes however, I felt the messages are a bit ambiguous and it becomes difficult to see how everything interconnects but it's not until about halfway through the film you really start to understand how it all fits in. Alejandro Gonzalez certainly likes his audience to work it out for themselves what we are meant to learn in this film and I think for different people, we will all pick up something different while also picking up similar things.I don't want to say that we pick up 'lessons' because it's more about getting a better understanding of things we may only have brief knowledge on. What I picked up is that as human beings, we all have different cultures but our need to help, to feel compassion, to protect those we love are always things we share. Cultures may have different viewpoints on how we do it but in the end, that is what connects all of us within this world.While I don't think this is as good as 21 Grams, this was still a powerful movie and it's movies like these which really make you think about what life is all about.",Babel
185,bburns,Innaritu's Best Work Yet,10,27 February 2007,"In 2000, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu made ""Amores Perros"", a masterpiece with interlocking stories with the common theme that you can tell a lot about people by the way they treat their dogs. Critics at the time called it a Mexican ""Pulp Fiction"", which led many to wonder if Innaritu would flame out early in his career like Tarantino did. Then with ""21 Grams"" in 2003, Innaritu made his Hollywood debut with another masterpiece with interlocking stories with the theme that God is at work in our lives, but not in the way most evangelicals would have us believe. But since this was only his second film, he still had time to crash and burn Tarantino-style. Now with ""Babel"", Innaritu has made an international film that is a masterpiece with interlocking stories with the common theme that it is hard to communicate with others, no matter how urgent or much you love them, if you make assumptions about their motives.It all starts with two young boys in Morocco, sent by their father to tend the family's goat herd. He has given them a rifle to shoot jackals with. The boys--who assume the rifle is a really cool toy and not much more--decide to test the rifle's range by shooting various far-flung targets, eventually aiming at a tour bus.On the bus, an American tourist named Susan (Cate Blanchett) is hit by the bullet. In a flashback, she is shown throwing ice out of her drink because she assumes the Moroccan water is somehow unhygienic. Later in the film, she violently resists a Moroccan doctor's aid because she assumes he is a savage. Her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) is frustrated in getting proper treatment for her because the rest of the tourists on the bus feel they are entitled to air-conditioned comfort and are unwilling to take any kind of detour that will make them have to deal with Moroccan people, who they assume are all terrorists. Another complication is that the US government won't let Susan take a Moroccan ambulance because they have assumed that the shooting was a terrorist act instead of an unfortunate accident, and also assume that since the Moroccan government is unwilling to share their assumption, that there is some kind of conspiracy between the Moroccan government and the terrorists.Meanwhile, Richard and Susan's kids are being cared for in suburban Los Angeles by Amelia (Adriana Barraza). Her son is getting married back in Mexico, and she is unable to find anyone else to care for the children, so she takes them along with her, chauffeured by her alcoholic nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal). Amelia assumes that Santiago will care for the children as much as she does. Santiago assumes the kids are just as eager as the Mexican kids are to decapitate chickens for dinner. After the wedding, a clearly drunk Santiago tries to cross the border to get back home. They are stopped by the border patrol, who assume that since Amelia does not have the proper papers for everyone and that Santiago is drunk, that they are trying to kidnap or otherwise harm the kids.And in Japan, a deaf teenager (Rinko Kikuchi) is frustrated by the fact that she can't successfully communicate with anyone besides her girlfriends. Her clueless father assumes she would rather stay with him than hang out with her friends. And her attempts to lose her virginity are constantly frustrated because cute boys run away as soon as they learn she is deaf. She acts out by going commando in short skirts and being sexually aggressive with men who understand her disability but who are far too old for her. When a detective visits her apartment, she assumes he wants to investigate her mother's suicide several months before, and tries to seduce him before he questions her father. In fact, the reason the detective wants to talk to her father is because he is the registered owner of the rifle that the kids in Morocco accidentally shot Susan with.I know that many of my more conservative friends have accused this film of being anti-American. It is all too easy, they say, for a Mexican national to criticize US policy towards immigration and the war on terror and blame it all on Anglo xenophobia. I would respectfully disagree. I think that the message of the film is that acting on assumption is an all-too-human flaw, which can lead to terrible consequences, particularly when acting on assumption is part of official government policy of the most powerful nation on earth. I would also add that American xenophobia is a very real and disturbing phenomenon in today's political climate (check out Lou Dobbs on CNN or Bill O'Reilly on Fox News).But my favorite storyline is the one about the deaf teenager, because it is the only story that transcends place, economic status, culture or language. Teenagers are teenagers no matter where they are, and they are almost always maladjusted until about 28.Orson Welles, Francis Ford Coppolla, William Friedkin, Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino are cinematic geniuses. Their best films are the best films ever made. But the trouble with genius is that it is erratic. These filmmakers have never created a consistent body of work and all flamed out by the time they were 40. John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood are craftsmen. Their films may not be as great as the genius's best work, but they are consistent in their styles, themes and the quality of their work. Sure, they might hit a slump that may last a decade or longer (ex: Hitchcock in the 1960's, Scorsese in the 1990's), but they can never be completely written off. With ""Babel"", Inarritu proves that he is a craftsman, not a genius. 10 out of 10.",Babel
186,colonel_green,"Truly disappointing, despite a fantastic cast.",4,1 January 2007,"For the last several years, I've been a regular patron of my town's independent theatre. I enjoy independent cinema a great deal, and so I expected to enjoy ""Babel."" However, this was not the case. ""Babel"" exemplifies what has become the 'formula independent film:'(1) Subtitles (2) Gritty cinematography (3) Disparate, barely-connected story lines (4) 'Artistic' nudity (5) Frank sexuality (6) Long stretches of artistic dullnessAt no point in the story could I connect with the characters; first and foremost, we're given essentially no background on any of them, so they're all left to fill cookie-cutter roles. There are about four different stories here; two (the Mexican and Japanese ones) are essentially irrelevant to the other two, with connections that are both contrived and remarkably tenuous. Not only that, but they distract from the segments in Morocco, where genuine life-and-death matters are in play; we occasionally cut away from a woman struggling to survive to story of a deaf-mute Japanese girl who suffers from sexual frustration and a variety of other indie-friendly psychological problems. These stories are extraneous, and only present because the director arbitrarily wants them there, rather than for any real link to the plot. Thematically, perhaps, there is a connection, but it just doesn't work as a film.It is incredibly frustrating, because all the film's problems are linked to the scripting; the cast is fantastic, from big guns like Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, to a host of unknown Arab, Mexican, and Japanese actors. Blanchett is egregiously wasted in a part that has her spend the whole movie either writhing incoherently or lying unconscious (at least she got to kiss Brad Pitt). The acting is excellent across the board (the collection of child actors, in particular, contains not a single annoying presence).The common parry to any thrust against this film is that it's slapdash plotting is compensated for by thematic coherence: that is, the difficulty of communication and misunderstanding. This theme is readily apparent from the first scene, but it is continually hammered home with a monotonous fervor of Ayn Rand-ian proportions, and it ultimately amounts to almost nothing. As I noted above, the characters remain vessels for the plot, and the climactic moments simply lack any connection with the audience as a result.I really wanted to like this movie, but it just doesn't work for me.",Babel

188,Monotreme02,"An unbelievable experience, emotionally gut wrenching",8,25 January 2007,"There are so many points to address in this film; I really don't know where to begin. I'll start with the first and foremost element: its lasting impression. The film is more emotional than anything I've seen all year. It's truly gut wrenching and extremely depressing. At many times the film is hard to watch not because of shocking imagery, but simply because the emotions portrayed on the screen are so incredibly powerful and bleak, one's stomach just can't take them. At the end of it all, the film is not a depressing one; while the stories contain deep and terrible tragedies, each one ends in what can be interpreted as somewhat of a redeeming note, although everything leading up to the very end is so incredibly bleak and hopeless, it's hard to accept the film as an uplifting one. But the incredibly raw, vicious and pure emotions the film portrays wouldn't be half as worth it if Innaritu hadn't known just how to portray them.Innaritu spends a lot of time with his characters. For such a broad, sprawling, worldwide film, it spends a lot of time in intimate moments with its characters in which their emotions at their most extreme are portrayed in full glory. At each of the characters' breaking points, Innaritu lingers with his camera for a long while, so that we can stomach the full caliber of their feelings. In all, the film is absolutely a directorial wonder  it's difficult enough when you have a film in no less than five languages, one of them being sign language; but all of the stories in the film feature child actors who do an absolutely stunning job, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be directing children in a foreign language.All the acting is absolutely stunning, throughout the entire film. After its emotional punch and the amazing directorial work, I'd rate the acting as the third most amazing asset of the film. And amazing it is. The known stars of the film; Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal do absolutely amazing jobs, although Gael's part is a little more limited than that of the other two. Cate Blanchett, one of my personal favourite actresses, is one you can always count on to deliver a solid, interesting performance, and she does an amazing job in this film, particularly in this one amazing scene between her and Pitt involving a pan. The real shocker is Pitt, who is really quite a hit-and-miss actor: On the one hand he has rich, juicy performances like in Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club; on the other hand he has dry, boring performances such as in The Mexican or Troy. But in this film he delivers what is easily one of the finest performances of his career: the raw emotions, the anger, the despair, the ferocity; Pitt does an incredible job at portraying these. His finest moment in the film: The phone conversation with home. But the real stunners are two of the co-stars; Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi, who deliver absolutely amazing performances; especially Kikuchi, whom I would rate as the breakthrough actress of the year along with Shareeka Epps of Half Nelson.The film of course displays much technical prowess, although in a very minimal way. This isn't exactly the visual masterwork that is Children of Men or Pan's Labyrinth, but the film does carry a unique cinematic style Innaritu utilized in his previous two films as well: Gritty, hand-held film-making that is never showy and never comes before the story and the acting, but that adds to the mood incredibly. The real stunning technical aspect of the film, though, is its editing. In what may be my favourite scene in the film  the nightclub scene in the Tokyo story  the editing is the best I've seen in any film this year.It is interesting to note that Innaritu insists that his film is mainly about children, and not necessarily about the human psyche and about communication. It is definitely no coincidence that the first credit to appear is a dedication to his three children, or that each of the stories involve children in one way or another. Indeed, in this sense the film can be seen as the second in a trilogy of films from our three Mexican filmmakers this year  Pan's Labyrinth about children in the past; Babel about children in the present; and Children of Men about children in the future. Loose, but the connection is there.Ultimately, Babel is an unbelievable experience. Emotionally gut wrenching, I actually found it slightly more accessible than Innaritu's previous three films, although it is much longer. This film is seriously engaging. It is also a directorial achievement of epic proportions: aside from the epic scale of a global film, the language barrier is also an extremely difficult obstacle to overcome. The acting is nothing short of spectacular from everyone involved: the stars, the unknowns, and the children together. The story is real, honest and engaging, although the film's real core is its characters, its emotions and its ultimate thematic relevance. And all of this is accompanied by a haunting but absolutely beautiful score by Gustavo Santaolalla. It is Innaritu's best work, and one of the best films of the year, right behind Children of Men. A masterpiece if I've ever seen one.",Babel

When I watched it I had no clue what the film was about but I really loved it. I finally understood the concept of the film when I read what 'Babel' means. For those who came in late 'Babel' is a tower built by the descendants of Noah to reach heaven. It seems god foiled the plan by creating a confusion through multiple languages. The backdrop of the story is confusion and its shot in Morrocco, US, Mexico and Japan. Its brilliant. The confusion is between people from different civilization, among the people from the same country and genius work is that the confusion is traced between parents and children. I must admit I still don't get why Brad Pitt connects with his children but may be I am reading too much between the lines. Morrocan family has done a fantastic job. Brad Pitt is brilliant. Alejandro González Iñárritu finally made a film which is not all about colors and camera angles. Hope he changes his narration next time as it looks very typecast for him now.

192,Michael Kenmore,"Disturbingly perverse yet emotionally turbulent movie; film, director & supporting actress Kikuchi deserve Oscars",8,24 February 2007,"(note this is more of a Otto Weininger dissertation-esquire sociological perspective from my point of view focused on a specific subplot than a review) I rented this movie not because of Iñárritu or any recognizable movie star, but because I read the reviews that this film have a subplot involving an emotionally unstable deaf-mute Japanese girl.I'm a hearing impaired man (deliberately didn't write the socioculturally respectable ""Deaf"" with capital D for a reason explained below) and while I'm considered an emotionally crippled person with misanthropic sentiment, I found Babel a powerful treatise on the nature of human connection in communication and emotional condition.The film's power to evoke emotions without treacly manipulation in a normally (& kind of loathsome) jaded American man like me is a commendable quality in cinematic achievement. I've seen Amores Perros in its original theatrical run years prior and while it was a very good cinema experience, it wasn't as emotionally resonant except disturbing depiction of cruelty to mammals in the beginning.I deal with frustration in inadequate communication almost every day since early adolescence. I don't have a good, positive & enrichening formal schooling experience and I make up for backward social skills with the fairly good grasp of English by reading a lot of magazine articles and books. When it comes to verbal conversation between me and hearing people, I resemble a stonewall and am often considered a rude man due to my constant stony silence and unintentional ignorance of people calling out at me not knowing I am deaf (I was in fact fisted in the face by a crazed hearing man on the street for this, unbeknowst to him; he was prosecuted and served a short prison term thereafter).I don't have much contact with the deaf community, either, owing to my strange isolated upbringing which cause disconnection in the first place. Sometimes people tell me I think too much, which is both a compliment and an insult. I either take it in stride or shove it back to them depending on attitude given to me. Like the Japanese girl giving an unique obscene gesture in fiercely blunt manner at the referee in the movie, I behave in similar manner whenever I'm inconvenienced by unfairness that lend to my belief of indignation at perceived injustice. Usually I'm calm and unemotional but my attitude can be unpredictable in sudden & aggressive hostility, as expected by deaf people who have dealt with frustration due to severely limited communication depending on the circumstance.So I identify with the deaf Japanese character a bit more and understood the reason for her uninhibited sexual frustration because of limited communication and interaction with the hearing persons (strangely deaf Japanese teenage boys her age are absent in the film, which may be stretching the reality unless the writer did a good deal of research on Japanese culture of the Deaf).Love is a powerful physiological matter of human life. Rejection as well as the shocked state of reality may cause disheartening emotional state. Jealousy inevitably lead to emotional volatility & mental anguish if not handled right with friends and family's emotional support when one is unable to get over it. She wasn't taught (instruction or social example) how to handle sexual feelings that develop in her teens and so she did the deeds considered (correct) inappropriate and for that she is rebuked in the harsh manner which lead to the furtherance of the emotional fragility of her confused mind. It appears apparent she's a teenage virgin nymphomaniac like a female Siamese cat in heat, laid low and rocking with tail pointed upwards with the curled tail tip in mad wagging. I knew young adult deaf Caucasian women are like that -- more so than the typical hearing counterpart (exhibit A: well-educated Colorado native deaf contestant Christy Smith's bragging of ""socially improper"" sexual escapades on one of Survivor season runs). Young deaf people are very much sexual beings and, because of the natural state of confusion in semi-meaningless adolescent existence, some may exert this misdirection of sexual outlet that would lead to serious trouble in unlawful/inappropriate conduct if caught or confronted. That's why there are plenty of deaf sex offenders convicted (either that or never caught) of rape and sexual abuse as well as obscene actual pornography possession (s&m, bestiality & kiddie).Deaf people are totally capable of love and lust as mandated by inherently urgent human biology, but oftentimes carnal is a matter of self-destruction when their burning conquest for romantic love have been repeatedly spurned that add fuel to their volatile emotions in rebellious resentment. Theoretically this lead to vigorous sex addiction or criminal conduct out of loathing hostility towards humankind as the by-product of nurture and nature arising from familial dysfunctionality and absence of positive environment in influence, interaction and example.Long sociopsychological rambling aside, Babel is one of the best films in years for its cinematic no-holds-barred emotional assault with raw acting (Brad Pitt has never been better with 'movie star' vibe eliminated and Rinko Kikuchi gave a strange yet quietly devastating performance), ruefully impactive screenplay (if a little contrived involving the main object responsible for the bizarre array of coincidences as if it's bad luck but a fitting story idea nonetheless) and even-handed direction by an immensely talented auteur, although it lacks the morbidly shocking and traumatically mind-blowing effects as the other film Apocalypto have on the first time viewing.Guillermo Arriaga & Iñárritu have achieved the magnificent masterwork that may be controversial for its disturbing scenes, especially incestuous allusion in one instance and the white American children's fate, but it make for an indelibly haunting emotional power captured on film.(As for my opinion on popular Oscar pick, I'm sorry to say, The Departed is flat-out mediocre & Martin Scorsese's direction weak in the flashy re-make of a far superior & tightly edited Asian film..)***1/2 out of 4",Babel

195,native_girl333,Unspoken,10,30 April 2007,"Alejandro González Iñárritu made it again! ""Amores Perros"" was brilliant and ""21 Grams"" was also fantastic but episodic Babel hit the like fast moving train. After watching the film I just sat there and looked at the screen tears falling out from my eyes.In ""Babel"" married couple Richard and Susan (Brad Pitt and always dazzling Cate Blanchett) are recovering the loss of their child when on a bus fare a bullet hits Susan. The episode launches a series of events and integrates four stories. González Iñárritu adapts different continents together skillfully.The story is written flawlessly and I have to give credit to the editor for making this kind of episode film very understandable. When you watch Babel kind of authentic and realistic movies you realize that catastrophe can knock the door of anybody. A war can ignite smallest of things. Babel is on the edge of it's time. You can't help at wonder how badly we humans treat each other.If you enjoyed ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams"" you will love Babel!",Babel
196,jimi99,anti-American,5,17 January 2007,"Of all the thousands of words lavished on this movie, I have yet to see it described as anti-American, which it most certainly is. Not only is this a description of the story, but is the ultimate theme of ""Babel"". Rich and beautiful Americans end up smelling like a rose at the price of third-world suffering. Japan is also portrayed as exploitive and decadent, on a par with America, at least in the eyes and minds of one Mexican director and screenwriter. I have been described as anti-American myself where its decadence and sense of privilege are concerned, so this is not a flaw with the film as far as I'm concerned, but a worthy theme. However, the whole film is such a mess that it kind of echoes its own title, a lot of noise and very little communication.And what's up with the Brad Pitt bandwagon? I think he cries once and gets angry a couple times, probably convincingly but not enough to care a whit about his character. Hmmm, that was probably Inarritu's intention too, the vapidity of smug Americans even when faced with crisis.",Babel

I did however rise to the challenge. Its really about nothing.So people sometimes suffer for being stupid. Is that the theme?What does Mexico have to do with two foolish American tourists cavorting through Morroco?

198,alrodbel,Sadness is the universal language,10,3 December 2008,"A film of accidental tragedies, each one of cultures as different as can be, yet all eliciting common emotions. The three venues were rural Morocco, upper class Tokyo and that culture called Mexifornia, where illegal immigrants become part of the lives of wealthy Americans.Others reviews describe the plot outline so I will not bother. Sadness comes in many forms. In Morocco it was the wanton testing of the range of a rifle by first aiming at a rock, and then a moving target in the distance, a bus, that the child shooter never expected the projectile to reach, much less harm a person.And then there is a chain of events where the Mexican caretaker must bring her charges, the children of the injured bus passenger, to her son's wedding across the border. While the events of this segment were fictional the tragedy of lives victimized by arbitrary border procedures is absolutely accurate.Intermixed with these is a story of a vibrant Japanese teenager whose deafness separates her from a sensual world she longs to participate in. Her pain of loss of her mother can only be assuaged by a sexual intimacy that also seems outside of her reach. If the destruction of the Tower of Babel was meant as punishment for man's hubris it was incomplete. With this film we have evidence that there are artists, who can write, direct and act....master the tools of this form of communication to provide a universal language.",Babel

A kid nipping off for a quick bell-ring and a Japanese schoolgirl who walks around trying to fork everything that moves. It shouldn't be a fifteen, in my opinion.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are both very good in this, even though Pitt looks like a fifty year-old throughout.It's like Amorres Perros, but not as good.I was wondering when the film was going to end, which is hardly an indication that I'm enjoying it.When the film climaxed, I was left thinking that some of the music had been good, and not much else.Very Art-house, and by Art-house, I mean boring.",Babel
200,the_Poppuns,And that's why you never hire an illegal,7,10 November 2006,"This is the third movie of Innaritu's interlocking stories that I've seen. Where it was great and original in 'Amores Perros', and meh and ""oh that again?"" in '21 Grams', it's passable here. Once you ignore the fact that he's at it again the story lines are pretty interesting.You have one central story starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett who are in Morroco for some reason. Either I didn't catch why or they never said. And she is accidentally shot by a stray bullet. Because they are in the middle of nowhere when this happens, it is insanely difficult for them to get medical attention for her. So most of that storyline is watching a frustrated husband trying to get something done for his wife. No great shakes here and Blanchett's part was non-existent. She could have put in a call to Peter Jackson and asked if they could borrow the wax Boromir to play most of her role. Brad did a good job but his role doesn't deserve the Oscar buzz he's getting. Because he did everything required by his role better and lovelier as Tristan Ludlow.There is another story about a Japanese girl who lost her mother and has issues. Serious issues. Again it's a pretty good performance but I don't really understand exactly what we're supposed to take away from it. I think this storyline and the Morrocan story share the problems of miscommunication, but then I don't get that from the third one so I'm kinda confused about how they all fit together. Maybe they're not supposed to. I did enjoy seeing more Japanese culture than I have in any other movie recently. I want to go to one of those J-Pop bars. I love the J-Pop. And I was disappointed in how little the father was in this storyline because I really liked him in 'Shall We Dance'. But this is probably the story I liked most, oddly enough.The US/Mexican story is about this idiot maid. She obviously has never heard of asking for time off in advance in the 16 years she's been living and working illegally in the US. She does something so ridiculous you have to wonder if Paul Haggis stopped by and helped with the plot. This is actually where I got confused because I don't know what kind of message I'm supposed to be taking away from this film because it seems like it's meant to be a message movie. Because if I was supposed to feel bad for her, no way. I hated her and when the inevitable happens, my main thought was ""don't let the border hit you on the way out."" If it wasn't for Gael Garcia Bernal, in an entirely too tiny role, that storyline would have been a waste. His last scene was probably the best in the film.I don't completely get what the title has to do with this movie. I figured that it was going to be about language barriers and how that can cause problems but it actually wasn't. Whatever issues appeared seemed to exist in only two story lines at a time. I guess it could be about clashing cultures, maybe? Anywho, the individual stories were interesting but they were only really connected by Brad Pitt's character. The movie is fine if you're in the mood for that sort of thing and if you like the director's previous work or you're a fan of one of the stars, you shouldn't dislike it, but I wouldn't rush out to see it especially if you have other movies you're considering.",Babel
201,moimoichan6,T for truth or trickery,3,7 December 2006,"Babel might be the melodramatic pendent of Borat : they both uses the same realist effects to denounce the absurdity of the world and the inhuman reactions of normal people, when they're confronted with abnormal situations, and they both tries to convict us that America is the direct cause of this inhumanity. But this search of the truth is only a trickery, which tries to convince us that, under the tears and laughs, we're dealing with reality, whereas all you can see on screen is a succession of poor clichés, unable to carry the message and the warning it wants to give us.The will of being realistic of Babel is too obvious to be true and only creates a too much effect, which underline the artificiality of the movie. In it, daring and choking scenes mechanically comes one after another in order to show a part of reality, but it only show an art of trickery : a young Moroccan masturbating himself, after watching his sister undress, a young deaf Japanese girl desperately trying to have sex with anyone (her dentist, a policemen, a dealer, her father, oops, sorry, not her father, are you insane ? ...) and, most important of all : a unromantic kiss between two A-list stars while one is bleeding and shiting... No, this is not South Park, this is how a Hollywood movie tries to be realistic ! But those too obvious tentative to archive the truth doesn't hide the clichés of it all : in this movie, the Moroccan are good and willing to help whereas French tourists are bad, annoying and selfish (they're ready to let one of the star actor die because, well, Morocco is so damn hot and there're no air conditioner in their bus), Japanese are techno fans, and are lost people in a too modern world, where all sign of affection is gone, Mexicans are nice people, but they drink a little too much at their weeding, and most of all, Americans are, except for the star couple, paranoiac (they see terrorists everywhere) and racist (they're taking poor refugees to the Mexican border, without even listening to them). It is not that the criticism is not true (that might be, but it doesn't matter), it is that it's too much to be credible, and the message is too obvious and to big to be taken seriously. This is not the real world, this is just a real bad movie.The movie tries to be too big, too full of meanings and too important, but only archive to be too long. And the weakest point of it must be the way the three stories are related one to another. In this kind of narration (see Magnolia or Traffic) all the events are connected in the end, and make sense altogether. But here, the main event  a tourist shot in the Moroccan desert  doesn't really leads to a chain of reaction which defines the all movie. Only hazard seems to link the characters  along with their suffering, a consequence of their incapacity to communicate  but there is no essential and necessary bonds between the stories, the events and the characters (see how the Japanese story is merely link to the other by a puny riffle...). And the thing is that those three stories, if you think of them individually, are poor and inconsistent and the fact is that they're only hardly and artificially put together. So, they lost their power and impact very rapidly, and the movie quickly becomes a boring succession of clichés.That's why this movie disappointed me so much, and that's also why I couldn't find in it the same authenticity and strength of the two previous Inarritus movies. On the contrary, all the defaults of Amores Peros and 21 Gramms, were all exaggerated in Babel, as if the director has been exhausted in front of the gigantic task the project implicated, and gave up for easy melodramatic effects, superficial but attractive criticism of modernity and of the USA, and a gigantic need to impress people.",Babel

203,Deckard-16,Words don't do this film justice.,10,13 November 2006,"21 GRAMS is one of my favorite movies of this century. so I came into this film with high expectations and they were met and, maybe, exceeded. Although BABEL takes place over a much broader canvas it isn't as melodramatic as 21 GRAMS. This is a quieter and more restrained film despite its much greater scope.The more you think about this film the better it gets and that it quite an achievement.It has been compared to last year's Oscar winner, CRASH, and there is no comparison. This is far and away a much better film. CRASH was preachy and didactic --a liberal sermon that preaches racism by saying that everybody is a racist but they may not know it or (much worse) too hip to admit it. BABEL is far more intelligent than that. It does not preach. Like the equally excellent FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS it does not take sides.Brad Pitt stars --and anybody who saw SE7EN and 12 MONKEYS knows this guy can really act-- and he heads a great cast, but the real standout performance is Rinku Kukichi whose work is not lost in translation.BABEL looks great, sounds great and is cut together great.

""Babel"" is told as fragmented, interconnected stories. The strong direction, cinematography and film editing make this film highly watchable. The screenplay and acting are very good. What is lacking is character development. The story jumps around between many characters and jumps around in time. Nothing wrong with this approach, except if it compromises character development. All the characters are used to convey thoughts, feelings and ideas about anger, fear and misunderstanding. With better character development, this would have been an excellent film. The style and technique are excellent throughout the film. Hand-held cameras give a documentary realism to the film. ""Babel"" ultimately comes across as an idealistic film, done with admirable style and technique, that tries to be a little overreaching covering the little stories of so many people. Because of the style, technique and strength of the individual stories told, I accepted the idealistic nature of the film and found it to be very interesting and engaging to watch.",Babel
205,deadsenator,"Moving, powerful, and insightful - 8 of 10",8,29 December 2006,"I felt there to be very few flaws in this film. The ones I found are greatly overshadowed by the energy this film carries. The acting seemed flawless with every character and the writing was great. The performances by the leads should gain them note, but the film as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Being powerless to help or do, communication breakdowns, personal responsibility, and personal relationships are the prime themes given that I collected from my viewing. These themes are gathered from separate stories that are connected. The stories run deep as do the connections and they are woven into a fine tapestry and laid out before the viewer methodically. Well done.I found the music to be quite rich and powerful which very much kept me involved and attentive in this long film. Despite its length, at its end I did not feel that it was too long. Instead, I found all of it engaging and much of it griping.Some have spoken about the director's overuse of negative themes, but I think these are simply things that actually happen in life and we are being given an eyeglass to see them with. I approve. The world is not all shiny and white and we should keep this in mind.A fat 8 of 10.",Babel

Whilst the inter-connected story lines thing is in danger of becoming a clichéd device, it worked very well here, never feeling forced or convoluted. The lovely direction and cinematography melded beautifully with across the board excellent acting performances (from the famous, not famous and complete unknowns) which, considering the use of complete novices, is a tremendous achievement.The things which stopped the film being a 10/10 for me were the somewhat ponderous running time  20 minutes could have been clipped without losing any content or feeling  and an odd sense of detachment. Despite the quality of the storytelling on show, only Chieko's story truly elicited an emotional response from me other than gloom. Perhaps this was a side effect of the pacing, as the tension was never really ratcheted. However, these are minor quibbles which really shouldn't detract from a film of the highest quality.",Babel

This is a movie divided in 3 episodes artificially connected each other. Three different stories, but the director wanted connect them to give a continuity solution to this movie. Really the cinematography is very poor, the music is boring and elementary, the story is so slow and empty that make you shake on the seat for 2 and half desperate hours. Usually in this situation people say: ""Save your time and your money!"" but the money is nothing in proportion of the time and the terrible boredom. Every episode is stretched to make the movie too long and the interest is almost zero. No originality, no show, no message, nothing intriguing just boredom and boredom.

Boring, boring,boring and stupid, stupid, stupid. Alejandro González Iñárritu has been good creating ""Amores perros"" but after he seems to me still learning and he does not get at all the sensibility for the timing. Is Brad Pitt (not at his best performance) at the sunset of his career exactly as already happened to every big star at his age? (See Stallone and Schwarzy, later K.Costner, recently Tom Cruise and now Pitt?). I don't know.

The only good thing about it is Brad Pitt's performance, but this seems out of place in an otherwise terrible film. Firstly the writing is so unnecessarily sexual at times, the unnecessary masturbation scene, the random and frankly stupid nudity scenes with the Japanese girl which absolutely disgust me. The four stories that make up the film are so random and put together in a way to make them seem clever, but in reality it just seems like it's been thrown together. The Japan story for example just seems like an excuse to throw in some nudity and in the end has very little moral or plot relevance at all. Then they have the gall to tack on at the end ""oh and he sold the gun to the guy"" by which time I've stopped caring anyway because I'm now so disgusted that I'm only watching to find out if Cate Blanchette lives or dies, in the end the whole thing seems rather pointless and annoying.

209,starlit-sky,Not one great movie but three great movies,10,31 December 2006,"Babel is probably the best movie of the year and the best movie I have seen in a very long time This is not just one great movie but three great movies combined. (The only other movie I rated 10 this year was The Departed, which was a crime-thriller). There are so many great things about this movie I am not sure where to begin.The Stories: The movie has three stories which are not connected directly with each other. They all involve characters who are victims of circumstances that are beyond their control. The movie begins in Morocco where a shepherd purchases a rifle from a friend and gives it to his two sons so they could use it to protect their sheep from jackals. Two teenage boys argue with each other about how far the bullet can reach and they try to settle the argument by pointing at things other than jackals, at objects so far away to test the rifle's power. And then we see a bus approaching from far away. In another story, a nanny in LA, caretaker of two children needs to attend her daughter's wedding in Mexico and has no other choice but to take the children with her. But things go wrong on the way back as they try to enter the US from the border. In the third story, a mute Japanese girl is trying to cope with her affliction and seeking some sexual healing. At the end you find out what the connection is between the stories but it is not a kind of connection that would affect what happens to those characters. Casting: Whoever was in charge of the casting for this movie did a terrific job of finding the right actors. I cannot imagine how challenging this must have been for the casting crew because you have American actors, you have Morrocon actors (maybe not as in nationality but as in appearance), then you have Japanese actors and you have Spanish/Mexican actors. All the actors put out incredible performances, it is really amazing. Most of them are not even well-known (imdb doesn't even have their photos). I think the Japanese girl should be at least nominated for Oscar (I have seen many actors nominated for lesser performances). She was GREAT. Even the teenage boys were very good. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette have small screen-time compared to other movies where they played the main characters. This movie doesn't really have a main character.Cinematic-Language: I loved the director's style. He tells the story so beautifully, the camera, the angles, the sound editing, music, the original score, everything was perfect. The movie really makes you feel for all the characters. This movie has such a humanistic message.Editing: I was also impressed by the editing; they did a terrific job of putting all the stories together - they all start and end at the right moment. I am not sure if there are any big productions waiting to be released in the near future, but as of December 31, Babel seems to be the biggest contender for Best Movie Oscar.",Babel
210,marcosaguado,The Virtue Of Misunderstanding,10,11 February 2007,"There is nothing coincidental about the human connection but if you're interested in finding a reason for it, for them - you would have to dig into your spirit. It was meant to be and it was meant to be in the way that it unfolds, no matter how absurd, how contradictory, how seemingly coincidental. I don't know anything about Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, other than he is one of the most extraordinary filmmakers to emerge in the 00's, but I suspect he has the soul of a Christian prophet, the mysticism behind the realism of his stories reek of God and of New Testament. Amores Perros, 21 Grams (the weight of the soul, remember?) now Babel the famous, or infamous biblical tower. Gonzalesz Inarritu has put together an immediate universe populated by incomprehension and humanity shaken and wrapped in a bloody cloth of the purest linen.

""Crash"" took place in an imaginary world where all anyone ever thinks about is race and stealing titles from superior David Cronenberg movies. ""Babel"" cannot even boast that connecting theme, it is just a movie about people doing really stupid things. Hey, let's drive home drunk across the US Border in the middle of the night with two white kids. Let's run from five-o, that'll work out. Hey, let's try firing live ammunition at buses. Then there are the wonderful ""that would never happen"" things, like Rinko Kikuchi's character, such a stunner that we are invited to ogle her time and time again, but those mean Japanese boys won't sleep with her. Right. I can't decide, was it racist or ethnicist to have the little Arab boy spying on his naked sister? Oh, and the entire thing falls on its face because A) the maid can't come up with a SINGLE place to put the kids, doesn't the couple have ANY friends? and B) she doesn't own a cellphone. ""Cancel your son's wedding."" Right. Funny that out of the big three Mexican directed films, this is easily the worst and easily the most recognized. Watching the three of them together and watching Inarritu condescend to Cuaron and del Toro, his vast superiors, and now the argument with Arriaga over who came up with this junk to begin with.

212,shhimundercoverdamnit,Babel,5,11 February 2008,"Well, a bit over-rated. It isn't really a bad film, in any stretch of the imagination, it just isn't nearly as entertaining as The Departed, which rightly deserved Best Picture. The acting is fine here with Brad Pitt finally coming off a stretch of just horrible performances. ( Troy, Mr & Mrs. Smith) I didn't really care at all for the Japanese gals storyline. Her story I found stupid, a really cheap way to connect stories and make a movie longer. That Japanese cop also kept reminding me of Josh Hartnett for some weird reason.With all the critics and all, claiming it to be the ' most emotionally explosive film of the year' I am going to have to disagree, I found myself pretty distant to a majority of the characters and their situations. I could care less about Pitt or Blanchett's character. In all, I found all of the characters to be careless and prone to selfish decisions with catastrophic consequences. They all got what they deserved. For instance, in the beginning of the film Blanchett says something like "" Really, why are we here?"" Pitt responds with "" To be a alone."" Why Morocco? I actually thought the defining moment of the film was when Pitt's character offers Anwar, cash and Anwar instead refuses the money.",Babel
213,jafar-iqbal,"A solid, if unspectacular, movie",7,4 December 2012,"If you've ever seen Crash, then you'll probably have a good idea of what kind of film Babel is. It has the same sort of concept – four seemingly unconnected stories all interlock because of one random event. In this case, it's the sale of a gun. We move from California to Mexico to Japan to Morocco; four different stories, all somehow connected.The temptation to make a film like Crash is obvious, and you can't blame the filmmakers for trying. It's a solid effort, too, but I think Babel doesn't quite have the emotional impact its predecessor did. Don't get me wrong, the subject matter is interesting. Exploring what it feels like for different cultures to survive in a trapped world is a very effective and engaging topic, and the stories do justice to it. But at no point am I blown away by what I'm seeing, the way I did with Crash.Performance-wise, it's pretty excellent. Brad Pitt is fantastic as the haggard and distressed husband, and Adriana Barraza as the Mexican nanny is brilliant. For me, though, the stars of the show are the unknowns. The two Moroccan children playing brothers are very good, and Japanese star Rinko Kikuchi is the standout as deaf-mute teenager Chieko. I'd argue that connecting her story to the rest is a bit of a stretch, but it produces some great acting, so I can give her a mulligan.It's probably unfair to keep comparing this to Crash, but it needs to as it goes for the exact same narrative model. So as one last comparison, I'll say that Babel isn't at the level of that movie, but it is still an enjoyable movie in its own right. You're not gonna be blown away, but you are going to see some nice acting.",Babel

Because of that i was expecting that this movie would have been a master piece, specially for the actors included, but o surprise! the great intention of Gonzalez Iñarritu of telling different lives stories slightly related to a global scale was very disappointed an boring,the cuts from one story to another are so short between them that you begin to get tired at some parts of the movie,..,id didn't found what i expected, the remarkable things of this movie are the excellent acting roles of Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchet, Gael Garcia Bernal, Koji Yakusho (incredible), Adriana Barraza (atonishing!), and the moments of tension that kept you in some parts with your eyes wide open, the masterpiece of Gonzalez Iñarritu show that is the right moment for him to try another type of movie and search for originality, no more of the same!",Babel
215,DAHLRUSSELL,Trite Tedium unredeemed by great cinematography & good actors,2,28 January 2007,"Unwatchable! A friend lent me his DVD of this, and it still was a waste of money! To begin with, and grrrrr - ugh, to be fair, this is one of those fractured multiple story films which are not my favorite. If this movie has any target audience, it must have been composed for white American males in a certain disposable income range who are still young enough to identify themselves with Brad Pitt, but have some level of international awareness and social conscience. Is that you? (I see Brad raising his hand somewhere over Angelina's shoulder. ""Yes, that's me!"")The pastiche of scenes begins with two Middle Eastern boys with a rifle, a rivalry between them, and one of them masturbating while they tend goats and practice shooting after peeking at a girl while she changes. Then we have the American tourists (Blanchett & Pitt) having a well-acted, but generic argument as she washes her hands with antibacterial lotion - so we know she's shallow - and gets shot by a random bullet. (Not spoiling things here, this happens early.) Add a Latina nanny saddled with blonde children she has to take to her son's wedding. Then we have the pretty deaf Asian virgin whose mother has committed suicide. Are you interested now? Good! This may be the film for you!About ½ an hour into the film, I started skipping ahead, because this film, while beautifully shot, was going nowhere very VERY slowly. Now, if you've read my other reviews, you know I LIKE SLOW FILMS, so this was too slow for ME! As I skipped ahead through the next 10 sections I saw that we were still only incrementally farther along in each individual plot points. Then the DVD stalled and I screamed THANK YOU!!! Even the machine was sick of it!Yes, the film did manage to build tension, but mainly because you only were getting 5 minutes of each story at a time; I don't think the intended tension was frustration. I feel as if I have landed on Mars, to find that this film is getting all these nominations.",Babel
216,HiddenVoice,"Complex, compelling, thoughtful, sophisticated, fascinating multicultural drama that every one who thinks he/she is different from one another must see.",9,21 October 2006,"If Crash was a thoughtful,unflinching look at race relations,then Babel is about how different races misunderstand each other because of their uniqueness and the thousands of languages invented to confuse one another.And not letting them co-exist because they can never understand each other through their uniqueness.It's a story about how one bullet sends a group of people of different backgrounds into chaos,misunderstanding,and despair.They all collide and their lives are shattered.Because they are unable to understand one another.An American couple is on a trip to Morocco as tourists traveling in a bus.And high on the hills,two boys are learning how to shoot.But one of them accidentally fires a round.Unbeknownst to them,the bullet hits one of the American couple sending her husband to chaos and tension and tragedy as time runs out while desperately trying to get her to a hospital.But he is unable to communicate and express his situation,he is hopeless in this situation.So finally he gets her to a nearby area for help.A Japanese girl is disconnected herself with life and her father is trying to connect with her,a maid is trying to make it to a wedding along with her hot headed Nephew but gets caught up in a tense situation.She is taking caring of the American couples children.The world spreads news that the shooting is a terrorist plot and takes serious actions towards it.Totally remarkable film-making.It's incendiary.It mixes suspense,drama,thriller and deals with a universal issue so carefully, that a subject this sensitive seems easy to accept.It's another story told in the unique storytelling technique used by Inarritu in his previous films,which sometimes makes it hard to follow.It's as if you're trying to unjumble a puzzle and get the whole picture.It's groundbreaking but flawed.The film could've been told in a straightforward manner and still retained it's powerful impact.It's not a film like Memento,where once it's told in the forward moving time-line,it looses its uniqueness and becomes old fashioned.This is a striking and spot on drama,that transcends into being a taut thriller.It's powerful and told in an unconventional way.And I haven't seen this kind of thought-provoking drama in decades, about us and our differences.In another words,it makes Crash look ordinary.Crash was a misstep.It was totally undeserving of its Best Picture Award.Because Babel is what Crash wasn't and more.It has nothing in common with Crash except the subject it deals with.So,forget about comparing the two films.Babel has a stronger focus on what it's trying to do.While Crash just plays around with it.And if the Academy Award committee gave that undeserving film the Best Picture award over Brokeback Mountain,then they ought to give this film that award as well.Otherwise it should be stripped off from its judgments and its voting system should be rebooted.Because seriously,they don't know how to be fair.Inarritu makes each and every actor riveting and real.The characters ,and the actors who play the characters are absolutely convincing and get you the very first hour that you stay along with them and hope for the best.It's a gripping and provoking drama,thriller.It's a rare experience to have a film that deals with race relations and carves a thriller out of it and blends brilliantly.Like Crash,you can't single out any part or any actor.It's an ensemble work,and it's best judged that way.However,I was really blown away by the Japanese segment, about the young teenager girl who is completely lost in a populated world.And her struggle to stay connected with her father really sends tears to your eyes.You can really feel her pain and loneliness.It's a powerful work.Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko is heartbreakingly sad.And I couldn't help but feel for the whole story.Apart from that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's segment was equally striking.There are flaws in every film,and there are imperfections in every groundbreaking and powerful film.And this film is no exception.I was annoyed by Inarritu's unnecessary storytelling technique as many are already familiar with it.And like many people who feel really uncomfortable following his way of film-making,I too was unsatisfied with it.It's a unique way to tell a story but it can't work every time on every film.However, that should not be the reason not to watch this film.Another flaw was that some of the situations weren't believable enough.And not every actor or story blends well together.And too many subtitles.But, this is the true Oscar contender this year in my opinion.And my anticipation for Babel payed off as it is every bit as ingenious.Inarritu's craft is unique and absorbing.And Arriaga's script is tight and strong and has lots of surprises and emotions packed in.His characters are rich and real,and his collaboration with Inarritu has once again brought you a great piece of art.A true masterpiece of its own kind.A desperate look at humankind's biggest misstep of not being able to know what we are saying to each other.Not being able to accept each other because we're different.Not being able to see beyond our suspicions and judge.The film is aided by terrific Cinematography.Giving the film a gritty look and dark atmosphere throughout.You feel the confusion and tension of the situations.The editing is crisp.Though,the film could've been slightly trimmed.While the score and sets are standout.The setting,especially in Japan, is brilliant.Japan is shown as a futuristic urban,pop-culture world.Its looks and feel is that of a dystopian future for the young teenager.and we feel it too.A rare kind of masterpiece and a heartfelt drama of misunderstandings and confusion due to multiple languages.A drama,thriller about confusion and suspicion.It is amongst the most thoughtful and meaningful dramas..It is Inarritu's definite work,and all I can hope is that he and his team sweeps a lot of accolades next year.Because if it doesn't ,then I don't know what to say about the Academy Awards.This film just exceeded my expectation.A must see for everyone who thinks he/she is different from one another.",Babel

218,bastard_wisher,Epic yet intimate - the film that best defines our planet at the beginning of the 21st century,10,25 November 2006,"How the hell Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is going to top this one is beyond me. He's really delivered a transcendent masterpiece here. As much as 21 Grams was a progression from Amores perros, Babel is at least twice as much a progression from 21 Grams. Inarritu is really moving toward a very pure, poetic form of visual cinema. That he managed to do it within the context of a $25 million dollar Hollywood film is truly an unbelievable feat, a genuine act of beating the system (every bit as much as The New World was, but without Malick's legendary status within the industry to explain it's existence). It's really genius subversion. He obviously used Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in order to get the film made, but uses them in at most 25% of the film. 90% of the rest of it is not even in English! On top of all that, it has a completely un-Hollywood sensibility. Mood and visuals take considerable precedence over plot (far more than in Inarritu's previous work), and the results bare more far similarity to Olivier Assayas's recent work than anything that usually comes out of Hollywood. With this film, I think Inarritu has placed himself at the very forefront of youngish auteurs working within non-commercial cinema, anywhere. Certainly he's the best working (vaguely) within the American system, with this film surpassing even Paul Thomas Anderson or David Gordon Green. Actually, come to think of it, Babel is in many ways the film Magnolia tried but failed to be: An incredibly ambitious epic of intimate proportions, capturing with pitch-perfect accuracy the state of humankind at this moment, in this case not just in America but the world. I would go as far as to say it is THE film of our time, in any larger socio-political sense. Not that the filmmakers are ever didactic enough to reduce their film's scope into any particular ""issues"" (this is far from Crash II). Guillermo Arriaga's script perhaps shows sign of strain at times (particularly in finding a credible connection between the story lines), but I feel that it's possible under-development (at least relative to the first two installments of their trilogy) actually works in the film's favor. It suffers from little schematicness where it could have, instead letting the individual plot lines exist pretty much naturally on their own. My personal favorite of the story lines has to be the Japanese segment, which showcases the most of Inarritu's visually-dominated narrative approach (particularly the incredible nightclub sequence).",Babel
219,BJBatimdb,"An engrossing, well made movie",7,1 May 2007,"I'd seen the trailers for Babel and it didn't look that great but I saw the first ten minutes on a plane and then decided to wait to see it in better surroundings. I'm really glad I did, because it's worth seeing on the big screen.Like Traffic (which is referred to by several other reviewers of this movie) Babel involves several different stories tenuously linked. Unlike Traffic (in my opinion) Babel works really well. I think partly this is because it has very few stars. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett do not dominate the film - they are given the same weight as the other characters, and so the film feels balanced.It also feels as if it's unfolding organically, despite the non-linear structure and some fast edits. Each time the time or place changes, the characters and situations are well-written enough to be immediately engrossing, so there is no sense of disconnection. This is helped by the consistent cinematography, whereas Traffic played against itself in that respect.As other reviewers have pointed out, there are some illogical plot points but the film transcends them and is ultimately an interesting and affecting piece of work which embraces many aspects of humanity.",Babel
220,pookey56,scrabble,10,24 February 2007,"BABEL wasn't a perfect film. it had more than a few plot holes. But i can say this about this gorgeous movie:1) Adriana Barazza's performance as a short-sighted, yet tangible human being was amazingly good. 2) Rinko Kikuchi gave a heart-breaking performance as an isolated, deaf-mute girl desperate for intimacy. 3) Brad Pitt was robbed of a nomination. 4) the score by Gustavo Santaolalla was haunting and beautiful. 5) the film had a global feel; one of it's objectives, and yet interlocked the simultaneous events very well. 6) the cinematography was simple but breath taking. 7) the editing in this film was provocative, with time lines weaving back and forth. 8) police and other authorities are a pain everywhere, except, apparently, in japan.I have nit-picky issues with the screenplay and Inarritu's direction. But personally, i loved this film, in particular for the performances by everyone in it, and also for the craft of it's technicians. yes, this film had deep, global messages about communication, politics, and the human condition. But i don't have any problem with that. In a tight race for BP like this year, closer than i've ever seen in this category, BABEL could emerge the winner precisely for those reasons: craft, and meaning. a beautiful film.",Babel
221,Decko_koji_obecava,Loved the Japanese poontang. Unmoved by pretty much everything else.,6,14 December 2006,"But seriously now. This movie may be one of the better primers in support of the theory that a half-decent drama is tenfolds easier to make than a satisfactory comedy. When comedies suck, they just, well, suck. With dramas, especially those in the vein of ""Babel"", there're subtle degrees and emotional levels, there're striking locations and various other visual aspects the viewer can focus on - all of which means that it's almost always possible to salvage at least some enjoyment out of a sub par dramatic effort such as this one.Babel is far from terrible and it's a safe distance away from bad, but, unfortunately, it is also long way away from great.We're presented with four story lines on 3 continents whose overreaching inter-connections feel a little hokey and forced, making it hard to take them organically and not as artificially inserted plot devices.Two story lines that have the most immediate link - the vacationing, marriage-crisis-experiencing American couple and the two sheep-herding kid brothers who fire a rifle at a tourist bus in Morrocco - are the most suspenseful and gripping though still fail to inspire anything more than mild approval. Too many times both stories approach, or even briefly cross into the cheesy thriller territory.On the other hand the Japan storyline involving a deaf-mute teenage girl facing life without a mother who recently committed suicide, being cared for solely by her busy businessman father, allthewhile going through the hormonal throws of adolescence and struggling to make a connection with the world around her, is far more effective.",Babel
222,yevonwm,A very powerful and thought provoking film,9,25 September 2010,"I have one criticism of this film and I'm gonna get it out of the way first, their portrayal of Morrocco was a bit off. It's a very friendly country and although crime is common as with any low GDP country - you would not have a panic attack stuck in a Morrocon town for a few hours. Also it's much more built up than they give it credit for - I went on a 2 day tour there and we stopped in a lot of cafes with branded ice cream, kitchens and toilets, the scene at the start where they're sitting in outdoor tents is very misleading, I never saw anyone using makeshift outdoor tents in the time I was there. They skim over their mis-portrayal of it late in the film where they return to Marakesh and you realise how built up it really is.This was a really good film, right from the start the storytelling style made me really excited to keep watching it. Ignore the 'poo pooers' who claim that the storyline seems disjointed, I'm guessing they didn't finish the film. Their portrayal of what it would be like to be a teenage deaf girl was really enlightening and the way they show so many different worlds in one film just instantly opens your eyes. The stars don't dominate the film, they're just characters in one of the story lines so the film should still be watchable if you happen to dislike one of them. The number of issues the film addresses and the loneliness you feel to emphasise with the characters just draws you in and keeps you glued to the screen. 9/10 well deserved.",Babel
223,Paddy-49,Struggling with unexpected consequences,8,5 July 2007,"Babel is extraordinary both in its ambitious conception and in the fact that these ambitions are achieved. The idea was to try and tell a series of interlinking believable stories that illustrate the phenomenon of ""unexpected consequences""  on a global scale. It also compares and contrasts radically different cultures - each with its own mores and values.A Japanese hunter gives his powerful rifle to the Moroccan guide who made his hunting expedition enjoyable. The guide needs money and sells his rifle to a goat herdsman for 500 Dirhams and a goat. The goat herdsman tells his two sons to practice with the rifle by shooting jackals to keep them from the herd. One of the sons turns out to be a good shot and causally takes a random shot at a bus winding its way across the desert. The bullet smashes through a window on the bus into the shoulder of an American tourist on holiday with her husband during which they have been attempting to patch up their shaky marriage. Meanwhile the two children of the marriage are back home in California where they are under the care of a Mexican servant whose nephew is getting married across the border near Tijuana and she decides to take the children with her to the wedding And so on.As the various plots unfold we see some common themes. The clash between authority (the police) and the people (in Morocco, America and Japan). The dilemma of reconciling conflicting duties and loyalties (to family, friends and the community at large). The struggles of adolescence as a teenage boy (in Morocco) and girl (in Tokyo) each come to terms with the pain of transition from child to adult.The characters are totally convincing and the settings spellbinding. We see the glamour and colour and noise of Tokyo brilliantly thrown into relief by seeing it through the eyes of the teenage deaf-mute girl. We see the complete contrast of the life of a peasant farming family in Morocco which seems unchanged for perhaps two thousand years (the sudden arrival of the gun excepted). We see the materialism of California contrasted with the social family driven mores of the community in the Mexican village.The parent/child relationships of the American, Japanese, Moroccan and Mexican families are explored with the contrast of the American parents who have abandoned their children (however temporary that is and whatever the reasons) in sharp contrast with the Moroccan family where the children have probably never been out of their parents sight for more than an hour in their lives.""Babel"" is not a polemic and it does not have a message. It certainly does not ""rank"" the different cultures shown with any one being the norm and the others being the variants - each is seen as being equally valid and valuable. It is a classic ""I am a camera"" movie which observes and draws connections but does not preach. At times it is clinical and implicitly critical in its observations (the brilliant and chillingly awful portrayal of the otiose British tourist on the bus and his selfish wish to be rid of the inconvenience and delay emanating from the need to try and look after the wounded American woman. To a Brit like me this portrait was all too true and it made me squirm - as it was meant to). But actually this character is the exception not the rule. This is not a film about bad people, it is a film about how ordinary people caught up in the extraordinary sometimes struggle to know what to do.The production values of Babel are quite superb. The cinematography in such contrasting locations is consistently brilliant. The casting equally so  it is not a star movie (although the two ""stars"" Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are both very good) but a movie in which every character is convincing. I would rate this film as one of the best I have seen for years and I am sure that it will be seen as a classic.",Babel
224,Baldrick44,Hmmm....,6,17 December 2006,"I truly wish I could give this movie a better mark. But after leaving the cinema I was left with a sense of frustration more than anything else as I tries to make a link between four different tales that are supposedly linked by a common theme. The frustrating part is, the best tale is completely obscure from the others and in reality shouldn't really be there at all, but without it, there's only 1 from 3 decent story lines rather than 2 from 4. The stories center around an Arab family, whose two sons make a huge mistake; an American couple whose effected directly by the mistake; their children and the maid who feel the ripple of the mistake pass onto them; and a deaf-mute girl in Tokyo, whose only real connection with the story is that her father is involved in the incident in what can only be described as an extremely superficial level. But as said above, this is the best of the stories and besides the first one, the only decent one, as the other two are predictable and at times quite bizarre.The cast are good, and although Cate Blachett has been highlighted, I found that that the performance of the Japanese actress who played Chieko ( the deaf-mute girl ) was truly amazing and far surpassed Blanchett and Pitt, who at times seemed to be a little artificial. In fact I found the Arabian actors as well to be excellent, with the two children acting so naturally.Babel leaves you confused. Who are you supposed to feel sorry for in the story with the maid? What's the overall theme here? Why is the Tokyo story so important? If you want a see a good movie about events with a common theme coming together, see Syriana.",Babel
225,editor-299,Downer script highlights compelling film,7,31 October 2006,"I wrote last week that ""Running With Scissors"" was the year's most depressing screenplay. This week, I humbly acknowledge my shortsightedness. After viewing this newest film, ""Babel,"" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, I have amended that opinion.In fact, ""Babel""  a sort of international version of ""Crash""  makes ""Running With Scissors"" look like an episode of ""The Monkees"" (I'll go one further; it makes ""Traffic"" and ""Syriana""  two similar, multi-layered films  seem like a Three Stooges short, but enough of the bad analogies, I think you get the point  it's really, really depressing).Nothing, I repeat, nothing, joyful happens in this picture. It's constant tragedy from the very first frames, with a heavy side order of oppression and dread throughout.With that written, however, Babel is not a bad movie, not in any sense of the word. If one can overcome the pounding doom and gloom, one will find a quite intriguing movie that draws one into the complex tapestry of three separate stories that somehow (whether logically or not) weave themselves together, somewhat, by the conclusion.The title comes from the biblical tale of a king who ordered the construction of a large tower so that he might climb to heaven and rule with God. Not pleased at the monarch's audacity, the Lord smote the project and scattered the people, confounding and confusing them by mixing up their languages. Perhaps this confusion was exactly what director Alejando Gonzalez Inarritu (""21 Grams"") was trying to illustrate. In much of this picture, he does a fine job of it.The film opens with a Moroccan tribesman trading a new 270 mm rifle to a local herder for a few bucks and a goat; the herder's sons take the flock out and fires a round into a chartered tour bus. We are then introduced to a couple of cute blonde, blue-eyed moppets being taken care of by a Mexican nanny in San Diego. Later, a deaf-mute Japanese teenager gets kicked out of her team's volleyball contest.So far, this makes about as much sense as one of Al Gore's environmental speeches or George Bush's Iraq policy; but soon, things begin to fit together. The shot fired by the kids, it seems, struck Susan (Blancett), the mother of the two children.While her husband, Richard (Pitt), struggles to save her in a country with little or no modern conveniences outside of the major cities; the nanny's son is getting married in Tijuana. Richard tells her not to leave the children, but desperate, she brings them with her. Meanwhile, the Japanese girl is becoming increasingly psychotic and horny at the same time.This is the weakest link in the story, though, as her character is completely unlikable, coming on to a dentist, a teenage druggie and a cop, for no reason whatsoever (unless one counts her mother's suicide as a motivation).Meanwhile, the shooting has become an international incident (the US government believes it was a terrorist attack), so the Moroccan authorities search the area, finally uncovering the trader and forcing him to reveal whom he gave the gun to. These scenes are gripping and emotional, as the man is beaten (along with his wife), even though he doesn't know anything about what happened.The police track down the herder and the kids and a shootout takes place. While this is going on, the nanny's drunk nephew, Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal, ""The Science Of Sleep""), abandons her and the children in the desert. The Japanese girl continues to act more and more bizarre, finally appearing totally nude and standing on a balcony.I suppose we're supposed to find some deep, intrinsic, almost spiritual meaning to all of this. There isn't. It's just a long and winding tale of how people (from all over the world) screw up and make attempts at reconciliation through familial love.The problem is that the average viewer may be either profoundly bored or disinterested long before those resolutions appear. Decent acting, crisp writing and gritty, realistic cinematography make this one the year's top (if not a bit manipulative) dramas, and a sure bet for some hefty end-of-season award hardware.",Babel

This movie makes ""Gosford Park"" feel like a Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer production.Babel is maybe a half-page worth of story, stretched out over 2 1/2 hours and 90% subtitled. Easily the slowest, most disjointed film I've seen in a long time. There are four story lines, extremely thinly connected, especially one involving a young deaf-mute Japanese girl (wow, doesn't that line alone sound like an exciting flick?!). There's really about 20 minutes worth of actual story here, so the watch-checking tally is at an all-time high.

This is nothing new or original but makes sense for the way the movie is made.The American Tourist segment was the best of the 3 by far. Brad Pitt actually is getting better as an actor although I didn't consider the role demanding but he was believable and the whole situation was believable. The segments delves into cultural differences, selfishness, fear, politics, and the possibility of a father left alone to care for his two children.The Mexico segment was pretty good. There is not a lot to this segment and i don't want to give it away but it does give food for thought on the boarder patrol and people complaining about the number of Mexicans illegally coming into the US.The third story was weak in my opinion. The short summary was about a young Japanese girl (maybe 16?) who was coping with her mothers death and feeling like an outcast partially because she was deaf/mute. It had a good bit of sexual content I never connected to her motives of feeling accepted.The stories tied together seamlessly and there were no big surprises. This is a good movie but nothing great.",Babel

This felt worse than a spanish telenovela. I mean, what was the point? Oh, that the world is small, we're all connected, language is a barrier for all of us, blah, blah, blah. Great! But there has got to be a more pleasant way to present that message than this. The director of this film should never be allowed to make another movie. He is a criminal who robs people of their time. CRIMINAL!!!",Babel
229,sullibrandon,"Like Crash, only Simpler",6,29 January 2007,"Babel is a film that addresses some serious concepts in innovative and challenging ways, ways that will force the viewer to look at these issues in a new light. However, though it was well made, with first-rate acting, stellar cinematography, and a gripping sense of gritty style, it feels, for the most part, contrived and confusing.Remember the best picture winner Crash? Babel is basically Crash, only on an international setting, and focusing on cultural misunderstandings, bad decisions, and just plain bad luck, rather than racism and the way all our lives are interconnected. Oh, sure, in Babel, lives are interconnected, but there is only really one strong connection, while the rest are threadbare and feel more like a piece of string attempting to connect the stories. In Crash, every single story was interconnected in creative ways, and every connection meant something for every single person; the connections weaved in and around each other like a rich tapestry, while Babel just feels like a very basic basket.There are four basic plot lines. A couple of teenage kids in the hills of Morocco receive their father's rifle to hunt jackals, but in debating about how far the gun can shoot, they manage to hit an American passenger on a bus, Susan, played by Cate Blanchett, who is part of the second plot line. She and her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) have gone to Morocco to work out some of their marriage problems. (Why Morocco specifically, is never mentioned. Presumably they felt the vast desolate desert and potentially unsafe ice in coca-cola would be a good stress reliever.) The other plot line involves Richard and Susan's children being taken care of by their Hispanic nanny, Amelia, who needs to go down to Mexico to attend her son's wedding, taking the kids with her. The third one involves a confused deaf-mute Japanese girl who engages in increasingly risky sexual escapades, only making her situation worse as she goes along.To its credit, Babel is a fantastically WELL-MADE movie, well put together. The colors are mostly desolate browns and grays, increasing the effect of all the tragedy and sadness and bad luck. The cinematography was brilliant in a lot of ways. It was a little long (two hours and twenty minutes) but I felt there was a little wasted space. The acting was the best part of the movie. Brad Pitt turned in an impressively deep performance. Cate Blanchett was incapacitated for most of the movie, but for what screen time she had, she pulled it of well. The rest of the cast, right down to the little kids and the careless Moroccan teenagers, acted amazingly well too. Like I said, Babel is well-made.But all the quality film-making in the world can't overshadow a mediocre plot and story, which is what Babel suffers from. I kept on wondering why we were shown the sexual experimentation of this Japanese girl, as the connection with the other story lines was a fraying thread at best. Towards the end of the film the connection is revealed to us, but it does not justify the inclusion of her story at all. Sure, it was tragic, sure it was sad, but it seemed awfully forced and a little cheap. Of course the audience is going to feel sad for a deaf-mute girl, but even then her sexual escapades often just seem stupid and what little sympathy you had for her is reduced. The only two story lines that actually interconnect are the ones that take place in Morocco. Everything else is just kind of superfluous, and I wondered why it was included. In Crash, there was a reason for every single story, and you knew that reason the entire time, and even if you didn't, whatever revelation occurred at the end justified its inclusion. Perhaps I shouldn't be comparing Babel to Crash, as they are both meant to convey different feelings and themes, but another problem I found with Babel was that the themes it tried to convey did not come across very well at all.What are Babel's themes, anyway? Tragedy, culture clashes, escalation of one problem and how it impacts the entire world, and twists of fate, which is just a nice way of saying bad luck. Bad things happening to good people at the wrong time, all because of one or two people's bad judgment calls. This could have worked, but the problem is that all the bad decisions are happening at exactly the right time, in terms of maximizing audience sympathy and sadness at all the tragedy that is happening to these people. Sure, I was sad, my heartstrings were tugged, but looking back, it seemed like I was kind of cheated, like my emotions were toyed with. It cheapened the experience of the actual movie.Like I said, I suppose Babel is a good movie. I can understand how some people would find the storyline captivating. You could take it or leave it. That seems to be the kind of movie it is. It can sweep you up in its story, but there's also a danger that you'll be left wondering what in the world you just saw, and why. The messages Babel sends can be confusing, unfocused, and just generally all over the place, leaving me thinking it maybe should have been named Babble. (I'm sure I am not the first critic to make that joke.) I'm also mad because it stole a best picture nomination, one which should have gone to Children of Men, by far a better movie. I'm glad I saw Babel, though, because it also seems to be the kind of movie that just begs to be seen, and regardless of all the problems I may have with the film, I will give it that.",Babel

Kind of the like ""The shot heard 'round the world"". This movie was very good. I'm only 13, I watched it with my mom after I rented and she wanted to watch it.

232,IRateFilms,Emotionally charged.,8,9 November 2006,"Using an ensemble and international cast, Babel shows how one small act can lead to a plethora of interconnected life-altering situations. As the film jumps back and forth between three continents, in the comfortable style Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu has made us accustomed to, Cate Blanchett, Gael Garcia Bernal and Rinko Kikuchi give performances realistic enough to make Babel a documentary. In their third collaboration, Innaritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga team back up to bring us the story of six families that come together through one act of innocent violence. As the title suggest, this is a film about communication, and the perils brought forth by any lack of it.Writer Arriaga, sends a clear message in his second attack at the United States border patrol, following Tommy Lee Jones' directorial debut The Three Burials of Melquiadas Estrada. His message is a lashing out of enraged feelings of hatred that have been caused by the mistreatment of Mexicans trying to cross the border into the United States. In the meantime the potent message of societal importance is shockingly and abruptly shoved in our face, as the wounded American gets her accident spread across the entire globe, while the brutal beatings of Moroccan peasants is brushed off like just another day.Shot by the incredibly talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, and scored by composer Gustavo Santaolalla, Babel really has everything working in its favor, and it really shows. The haunting score not only helps to elevate every scene, especially those without dialog, but also adds a new dimension which is then transcended with the use of this raw photography. As in his previous two films Innaritu tells the tragic story of these families out of order, which unlike 21 grams, helps to elevate the tension. Intertwining the story of a shot down tourist in Morocco, a Mexican house maid bringing children across the border, and a Japanese girl dealing with her mothers death, Babel charges emotion with a high voltage. The filmmakers have succeeded in bringing the three stories together, although the third, that of the Japanese man, seemed a tiny bit forced.Truly sending out a deep message about people's honest and misunderstood intentions, this epic emotional drama has some of the most realistic and thought provoking events brought to the screen this year. I believe that many people will be holding on to the edge of their seats to the very last shot, which like the rest of the film exemplifies the beauty of this film.",Babel
233,RobinCook70,Too Many Buttons,4,13 January 2007,"I ""got"" the point(s) of this movie, but it was tediously long, annoying and frustrating. I was literally exhausted when it ended. I'm not sure which message or messages this movie is attempting to send, but I think one thing is clear ... they attempted to push too many buttons on issues to cram into one movie for a moviegoer like me to walk away feeling good about watching a movie. Yes, it was a well-done movie, but that is about as far as I would go ... it certainly wasn't enjoyable to watch. This is one I definitely would not want to watch again so it isn't one I would want to buy to own.I guess I see enough ridiculous reality in my own station in life and being helpless in asserting any kind of changes or fixes.

234,GeneSiskel,Stuff Happens,6,5 November 2008,"Babel illustrates the familiar notion that seemingly local and even innocuous events may have global consequences: If a butterfly flaps its wings in China, etc. etc. Three slow-moving -- and I mean SLOW-MOVING -- cross-cut stories set in Morocco, Japan, and the border area of the United States and Mexico are linked by a single event occurring off-screen nine months earlier.The cinematography -- panoramic shots of arid North African mountainsides and village huts, Tokyo clubs and skyscrapers, a Mexican wedding -- is excellent, and the local color makes for a good travelogue. However, the leading actors, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, are given almost no material to work with. Pitt, for example, spends most of the movie shouting, ""Wait! Wait!!"" Blanchett gets to bleed.The plot, such as it is, moves forward thanks only to a series of implausible events -- for example, the notion that the United States Embassy in Rabat, without performing the slightest investigation, might publicly attribute a random shooting to terrorists. (I mean, we know there are no Weapons of Mass Destruction, right?) On the other hand, maybe that's the subtle political point of this film: We live in a global village, words and actions matter, we should look out for and support each other, there are no assured happy endings, and the U.S. Government should lighten up.",Babel

The film is set in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the US, and the director makes full use of the different backdrops to bring the picture alive. The characters are deep and insightful, each has a problem to face up to and the subtle, naturalistic way their issues play out make for truly emotional cinema. This is not a film about heroes, it's a film about try ing to make the right choices when your back is to the wall, and the doubts that go with this.

237,greenylennon,When it's impossible to understand our neighbour,10,22 February 2008,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu gives us a movie whose disconcerting depth will surely remain the same also after this time of mistrust and incomprehension who is the long post-Septemebr 11th. A shot coming from a rifle in Morocco creates or makes explode problems and crisis anywhere in the world, from the chaotic and shimmering Tokyo to the melancholic frontier separing US from Mexico.This shot tears to pieces Cate Blanchett's white neck, while her dying marriage to Brad Pitt has a subtle, gentle but violent blow of life; the same shot introduces us to the tragedy who's occurring in the existence of Chieko, a lonely and deaf rich Japanese girl; and the same shot has even echoes in the desert between US and Mexico, where we assist to what's happening to Amelia, the Mexican babysitter of Blanchett and Pitt's children.I don't want to spoil the plot, as they did with me, because you'll enjoy the movie only partly; I will say that stories travel either in space and time, so you need to pay attention.The amazing actors, the splendid directing and screenplay and the nearly perfect cinematography and editing help the movie to stay in the viewer's mind forever.",Babel

All because it's a ""foreign"" movie. That's the advantage of making a movie with this kind of tone to it: at worst, the reception by the public will be maybe just slightly above average, and at best, be received exactly how this movie was: as a great movie. The truth is this was a long boring waste of time.This is one of those movies where you could miss 5 minutes of it here and there, and it would have absolutely no bearing on anything. I thought in movies, every piece of dialogue, every frame of every scene *counted, and was shot a certain way for a reason? This is like the opposite of Back to the Future. This was unnecessarily long because they spent so much of the time showing characters doing trivial things that didn't advance the overall plot.When they cut between the 4 separate story lines going on, taken by themselves they are pretty good scenes that are well acted and leads to those characters' individual story arcs. But you don't just cut together 4 separate stories like that without some central plot to tie it in and expect to get a good movie. And no, the damn rifle doesn't count. Don't even try to act like that minimal amount of relevance some of the characters had to each other amounts to anything, because it doesn't.At about the halfway point of the movie I was sitting there wondering what the hell was the point of all this, and didn't really understand where they were going with this. As the minutes ticked by beyond the halfway mark, I slowly came to the sad realization that I had in fact wasted my time on yet another over-hyped movie (up until then I assumed it would get better, silly of me).You don't make a movie like this. That's not how you do it. A book maybe, but not a movie. There was 0 drama, 0 tension, and the number one important thing, 0 empathy for ANY of the characters, and without that, why even watch it?",Babel
240,abum190,"Poetic, but lacking true emotion",7,14 November 2006,"There are only a few moments in this film where I felt true emotion and true compassion in the cinematography-laden Babel. There's no doubt in my mind that the filmmakers meant for there to be more, and because of that it failed to inspire me as much as, say, Crash did. I cannot deny the power of this movie, but it is not grounded or powerful enough to resonate in the mind like Crash does.This is not to say that Babel is a bad movie. It is quite a good movie with very good performances. Brad Pitt is barely recognizable with a beard and several wrinkles. But the imperfection of his features doesn't matter when compared with the realistic passion behind his performance as the husband to a wife (Cate Blanchett) that mistrusts him. When his wife suffers from a bullet wound, you forget all about his stardom and focus on his love. Blanchett has less of a role to play as the wounded wife, but she effortlessly conveys the layers of her relationship with her husband behind the pain and anguish of her suffering.The two Moroccan boys who shot her are part of a separate but interlocking story about a rural family in Morocco that just purchased its first rifle. When one of the boys shoots at the bus Blancett is on, it sets off a chain reaction that sends Morocco and America into political turmoil, not to mention their family. There are no-name actors here, and they are not particularly stunning, but their story is touching. Another storyline, possibly the least memorable of the four, involves the children of Pitt and Blanchett and their Mexican nanny who takes them across the border. Gael Garcia Bernal is terribly underused in this portion of the movie, but when he is on screen he steals the show.The best, most disturbing, and most pathetic storyline is that of Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a deaf-dumb Japanese girl suffering from unsatisfied sexuality. The lengths to which she goes to fulfill her desires are pitiful and moving, and her character is the most nuanced in the movie.The cinematography is truly breathtaking in some parts of the film. I will be surprised if this is not up for a few Oscars at the end of the year. It is a profound movie and deserves recognition, but in my opinion, it does not convey its message nearly as clearly or deeply as it could have.",Babel
241,Kryzak,"Smart movies with great plot, but hurts itself by the ""weaving"" device",7,31 December 2006,"In the tradition of great movies like Syriana and The Hours, Babel weaves 4 seemingly unrelated stories in four different languages together into a pretty good tapestry. While each of the stories explore a type of communication (or lack thereof) between different relationships (father and daughter, husband and wife, etc.) very well, when put together, I felt the movie was missing the ""magic"" that made Syriana and The Hours great movies. Maybe it was because one of the stories was so tenuously linked to the other three, or maybe it was because of the jarring transitions between the stories before a scene comes to a conclusion? I cannot answer these questions definitively, and will have to let the movie goers decide for themselves.Acting wise, all the actors in the movie were very good (Brad Pitt taking a George Clooney-esquire turn a la Syriana). The most heartbreaking story focused on a deaf-mute Japanese girl's struggles, and the actress there was superb. I will not spoil the movie for everyone, but that story alone is worth the ticket.While I personally don't believe this to be one of the best movies of the year, I do think people should see it for the cultural issues it discusses. It takes a look at the immigration issues of the US, as well as the ""terrorist"" stigma many Islamic countries are branded by the US.

Without any didactic preaching, the story (and Inirratu's sure directorial hand) moves the viewer through pain and redemption like an exploration of a perfect diamond. The film travels from a poor sheepherder in Morocco to the final scenes atop a rich penthouse in Tokyo putting the viewer through a kaleidoscopic journey of the heart.Ultimately, the film becomes a great celebration of the human spirit and a testament of precisely what a high art the cinema can be at its best.

244,suvopyne49,A great and impactful visualization of lives,10,21 September 2011,"Sometimes, through the eyes and great direction of some directors, a movie no longer appears to be just a movie. It becomes a piece of life. Babel is exactly a movie of that sort. The way the movie portrayed the different cultures of different countries is excellent. But the thing which deserves more plaudits is how Alejandro Gonzalaz Inarritu showed life thriving in different environment. The movie is, one can say, based or set upon one single event. A misfired (though it was a hit) shot from a winchester rifle in the deserts of Morocco changed the lives of 4 families. Spanned over 4 countries, the way, Inarritu showed the aftermath of that incident, is exceptional. The greatness about the story-telling is that it tells four or five different stories and everyone of which one can relate with, surpassing the cultural barriers. Just like the movie's poster, it's a collage of moments, moments which everyone faces once in their lives even though they don't want to face that. The cinematography; be it deserts of Morocco or Mexico or the Suburbs of Japan, the cinematography played its part and boy! Did it play well. It is one of the ingredients which makes this movie an art. It's like poetry in motion. If Cinematography is one of the constituents, then another has to be the performances. The stars, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were brilliant. Blanchett didn't get much to show her prowess though; but Pitt was excellent. Rinko Kikuchi and Adriana Barazza's Oscar nomination is very well deserved and justified. Personally, Kikuchi's performance appeared very heart-wrenching and thus phenomenal to me. Not to forget the performances of those two Islamic Moroccan kids. Finally, it is one of those rare movies which can put one into a trance or a reverie, even after the credit gets rolled. One of the reasons for that is the soundtrack 'Endless Flight'. It's a privilege watching this sort of movies.",Babel
245,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,"Global interlocking of human drama, and too much tragedy layered on thick for its own sake",6,28 December 2006,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's last effort is by no means a bad picture. In fact, I would say it has some remarkable qualities going for it, first among these Iñárritu's more than competent hand in directing. This lends the movie strength and narrative confidence where there are some otherwise potentially distracting contrivances and weaknesses. The accomplished directing earned the Mexican filmmaker a Best Director award at the Cannes film festival this year, in my view a well deserved win. The acting in Babel is also overall top-notch, with Brad Pitt, Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko), Adriana Barraza (Amelia) and Boubker Ait El Caid (Yussef) truly shining among a talented cast from five corners of the world. On the other hand, Cate Blanchett's limited role doesn't unfortunately offer the Australian actress many opportunities to showcase her talent. However, with this viewer the movie ultimately did not strike an emotional or intellectual chord that was more than skin-deep. Especially during the second half, I was a little too detached from it all, occasionally feeling tempted to mentally parody certain scenes and elements. After a while, I felt bombarded by high-strung drama for the sake of yet more high-strung drama.I haven't seen 21 Grams, but considered Amores Perros an extraordinary cinematic achievement when I first saw it in 1999. In my view Babel was simply an exercise in the same vein and style, adding nothing new to Iñárritu's development as a filmmaker six years from his explosive and fresh debut picture. With Babel, there seemed to be very little in the way of a stylistic, technical or thematic evolution: the movie, albeit well made, was artistically in many ways just the pale shadow of Amores Perros, furthermore with a few too many narrative contrivances for comfort. The addition of some expertly chosen flourishes (for instance, the setting in four different countries and the addition of an Islamic terrorism theme) all strove to distract the viewer into believing they were watching something entirely new.Babel is among other things about consequences, and the way that apparently small decisions and actions - sometimes taken with unintentional flippancy or foolishness - will bring on a whole chain of potentially catastrophic consequences, occasionally even with an earth-shattering global chain effect. This is the cinematic equivalent of the butterfly beating its wings one time too many in Canada and provoking an earthquake in Indonesia. Babel also explores fatality, another element it has in common with Amores Perros. My biggest criticism of Babel, however, apart from Iñárritu layering the drama on too thick, was its tendency to spoon-feed you big, worthy and topical issues, all neatly selected to represent humanity's global concerns du jour. For instance: the split between East and West, or wealthy and poor, or Muslims and Judeo-Christians (with America and its allies suspecting Islamic terrorism at the drop of a hat in the Morocco-set segment). Alternatively: prejudice and the dehumanisation effect of certain laws transforming a mild and warm-hearted Mexican nanny into a generic and faceless outlaw, a cypher for an illegal immigrant to be hunted down and brutally detained at all costs.If all else fails, just add personal grief and disability to the thematic cocktail, stretching the scope from generic global tragedy to personal tragedy (thus showing that your movie embraces both macro- and micro-suffering!). Sure enough, Iñárritu does so as well: Chieko, a deaf and mute teenager in trendy Tokyo, struggles to overcome the trauma of her mother's suicide, as well as her own disability. It obviously makes attracting boys and fitting in with her peers much more difficult than it already would for a moody teenage girl. While Chieko suffers from the grief of her mother's death in Japan, Richard and Susan, two American tourists in Morocco, discover that a life-threatening accident will ultimately help them elaborate the loss of their youngest infant son to cot death. I couldn't help thinking that all that was missing from this hit parade of typical noughties topics was a homosexual theme!I would never discourage anyone from watching Babel, as it does still have the power to entertain and even move in parts. As mentioned above, it's an extremely well directed, well acted and well presented dummy's guide to our era's most topical global issues. Personally, I would have loved to see more of Chieko and her father, the police detective and Tokyo in general. Unlike the others, I found that the Japanese segment contained the seeds for a story that could be developed into a full-length feature. As it stands, it was engaging but rather half-baked, while the other segments were more limited but ultimately came full circle. After Babel, I am now keen to see Iñárritu explore entirely new artistic avenues. I'm still convinced he is a truly talented filmmaker, and would be the first to feel saddened at the notion that he may turn out to be just a one-hit wonder (with Amores Perros being that first and only truly remarkable cinematic achievement. Although not having seen 21 Grams, I'm not really in a position to say). Instead, I would like to believe that Babel is simply a ""transitional"" movie, a stepping-stone on the way to something truly different and original, into an entirely new phase of Iñárritu's life as an artist.",Babel
246,adam-may-bower,Doesn't Fit Well,7,2 June 2018,"'Babel' is a well-acted melodrama, with four separate stories, that may be compelling, but don't exactly fit well with each other. The whole intent of this film was to tell four different stories of people across the globe, and then connect them all. While three out of the four stories do connect nicely together, the fourth plotline about Japanese girl Chieko stands out far too much from the rest of the film and is poorly tied, with an insignificant connection. The three 'key' stories, involving Yussef and Ahmed (played by Boubker Ait El Caid and Said Tarchani) in Afghanistan, joined by Richard and Susan (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) as well as Amelia (played by Adriana Barraza) in Mexico all fit well together and display a captivating and sorrowful story. The characters are directly involved with one another, and they are even set in a similar desert climate which gives similar aesthetics and enhances the feeling of connection. In stark contrast, the story about Chieko (played by Rinko Kikuchi) is set in the modern city of Japan and is loosely connected to the others. Her storyline may be a good one in its own right, but it ultimately doesn't fit with the rest of the puzzle that is the film. However, this disconnect is not to the demise of the film as it is redeemed by the fantastic acting, with Cate Blanchett, Brad Pitt, Mustapha Rachidi and Adriana Barraza being clear highlights. Alejandro G. Iñárritu's direction is brilliant as this film is filled with captivating shots of the different settings and the cinematography is striking. The real highlight of this film is in the soundtrack, by Gustavo Santaolalla. The music is extremely effective in provoking the emotional response intended for its audience and is certainly deserving of it's Oscar win. Overall, this film is an epic piece of misery, that is only let down by its hit-and-miss attempt at telling different stories that are meant to connect well.",Babel
247,carljessieson,A Beautiful Film,8,29 September 2010,"This is one of those films where several different stories are weaved together, and fortunately, it's one of those films that does it well. Four stories: a couple vacationing in Morocco deal with tragedy, a maid battles between responsibility and personal needs, young boys make a mistake and are too afraid to come clean, and a deaf-mute in Japan deals with peer pressure and the death of her mother. These are the most bare summaries I can give, because I don't want to give too much away, but I promise this is a really interesting movie. It's very good. Definitely worth your time.Because of the four different stories, there's a lot going on and there aren't really any boring points. I remember being interested the whole time, and I really liked it.The first time I watched the movie, I didn't put subtitles on. I thought they would come on automatically, and since they didn't, I thought it was a brave move by the filmmakers, an attempt to make the viewers interpret the plot according to facial expressions, body language, and intensity of vocalizationabstract, film student things like that. Hah. I was wrong. You need subtitles. It's definitely better with them. :P This film is very visually pleasing. The cinematographer did a really great job. Pretty much every scene is beautiful, and every landscape shot is gorgeous. The dialogue is very good. It helps the story, it helps the viewer's understanding of the character, and it's well written. The acting is good. There was no one I really had a problem with, no one really destroyed the illusion, so that was great for sure.It's a very good movie and I like it a lot, but for some reason, I didn't love it immediately. Maybe I need to watch it a couple more times or something, ponder it further, I don't know. There's something keeping me from loving it and wanting to buy it as soon as I can. Nonetheless, I recommend it. It's a good film.",Babel
248,Deathstryke,Exhaustingly emotive,6,14 February 2007,"Babel is, in a nutshell, a serious and often quite harrowing depiction of what happens when the the consequences of one person's actions ripple outwards and affect others across the globe. It is a tense experience; its vast cast, multiple plot lines, settings, timezones and language switches demand absolute attention. What's more the subject matter is often uncomfortable to watch, and at times, it feels unnecessarily thick.In the first ten minutes we witness a young Egyptian boy masturbating to the memory of watching his sister undress through a crack in her bedroom wall. A deaf-mute Japanese girl driven into a living death by her witness to her mother's suicide, her inability to hear or to express her true feelings, and her burning desire to be taken sexually by a man drive her to perform increasingly wild and desperate pleas for attention, which usually involve her popping pills and flashing her nether regions at unsuspecting strangers. Some scenes suffer from an overly excited camera which trucks and pans madly to accelerate the tension, and one scene set in a Tokyo nightclub has strobe lighting so violent it could turn the brain of anyone with even the slightest touch of epilepsy into mush.It's an exhausting journey that rarely stops to breathe. Thankfully the editing is masterful and you never feel like you're not understanding fully what's going on, all the dots are rigidly connected. The performances are terrific, most notably from Rinko Kikuchi and Adrianna Barraza. However the film only exploits specific emotions in its audience, mostly shock, sorrow and agitation. Do not expect a happy reward after all the turbulence.",Babel
249,JAM-31,Forced and Underwhelming,5,2 February 2007,"I had heard mixed reviews on this film, but I figured I would enjoy it. I expected to find it at least emotionally exhausting, with maybe some interesting points of view for discussion. I also really liked the director's other films, ""21 Grams,"" and ""Amores Perros."" But ""Babel"" never amounts to much. It gives us random stories, with supposedly interesting characters, that have forced histories and conclusions.We have the Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett couple, traveling in Morocco. Blanchett explains that the couple had a newborn die recently, probably of SIDS. This doesn't appear heartbreaking or real--it's just another back-story, a ""so this baggage explains our current mood and want to escape"" revelation. I never felt like I knew much about the couple at all. They're just another plot device with a back-story. Why do people think this is Pitt's best performance ever? The couple's story involves Blanchett getting shot at random in Morocco, yet still the movie never feels urgent. We know too little about this couple to care whether or not she'll make it.Then there is the couple's illegal alien maid back at home, watching over their children. The character is a saint, and so are the children. That's all she is, a saint, another by-the-numbers character.The young Japanese girl has a more involving story, but it doesn't feel any less contrived. She's deaf, mute, has an attitude, her mother died, she has a strained and distant relationship with her father and she's sexually frustrated. I don't understand why the makers of this movie thought the character's sexual frustration made her more complex, interesting, or unique--she's not much different from any other (somewhat exhibitionist) girl her age. And I can't believe that young males would shun her because she's deaf, when she's cute and obviously willing. When we learn about the true reason behind her mother's death, the movie starts to feel like we're watching ""Lost"" episode flashbacks. The film is a group of stories that have back-stories we've seen in movies and on television more often than they happen in real life. The director seems to love the idea of having the audience wonder how these random stories could be related. When we do find out how, with a photograph, even the photo appears to have been doctored.The film's political messages are underwhelming. They aren't completely clear and don't have much fire to them. We are supposed to feel for the couple's maid, as she is stopped at the border by immigration officials. I didn't see any reason why her nephew would step on the gas and try to flee--it felt very forced. This leads to the tragedy of her spending the night with the kids in the desert and walking around for an hour or so the next morning--big deal. We later learn that she is illegal and will be deported. This is really only an afterthought, which has nothing to do with the movie (oh, BTW--she's ILLEGAL. And she loves the children. And she will be deported--how tragic!) The rest of the other political messages are unconvincing. Terrorism is just American paranoia? Moroccans and the Moroccan government care deeply about punishing their own who hurt Americans? Director Alejandro González Iñárritu seems to have been in a rush to make this film with gimmicky plots, back-stories, and irrelevant political messages. Grade: C+",Babel
250,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,TRAGIC MISUNDERSTANDINGS,10,1 May 2020,"Babel is not about the separation of peoples due to language diferences, as shown in the biblical account. Director Alejandro Iñárritu builds a plot that crosses stories of people visiting foreign lands and interfering, with banal acts, in the culture of the people.It is not a matter of not understanding different languages, since, in one way or another, everyone ends up understanding each other. What you see, in the stories that intersect, are not problems in speech, but in listening. Some misunderstandings follow. Sometimes with tragic consequences.Without spoilers, the stories in the movie are as follows: a Japanese businessman (Kôji Yakusho) goes hunting in Morocco and gives his guide a rifle as a gift. This man sells the gun to a friend, who needs to kill some jackals that threaten his goats.The two Moroccan boys, who graze the goats, decide to test the rifle and shoot a bus hitting an American tourist (Cate Blanchett). The world media claims it was a terrorist act. The tourist's husband (Brad Pitt) calls home and asks that his children's nanny (Adriana Barraza) stay with the children and not go to a wedding in Mexico. But she will.In Japan, a police officer seeks information from the businessman who donated the gun but ended up getting involved with his teenage daughter (Rinko Kikuchi). She is deaf and dumb, has gone through the tragic loss of her mother and is having difficulties in dealing with her sexuality.The four stories, well-marked by the precise cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto, should not have any connection between them. They all act in good faith, with great intentions, but by small mistakes, none of them criminals, everything goes wrong.The end of the movie takes place in a Tokyo skyscraper and is representative of the communication problems that characterize Babel. The Chieko girl experiences the pain that led her mother to kill herself. The father arrives and seems to understand that the daughter's pain is not being unable to hear, but the pain of not being heard.",Babel
251,cardinalbunal,You killed the American!,10,10 February 2007,"I almost forgot that this was a movie that also starred Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, as Inarritu as in 21 GRAMS and possibly the rest of his work I haven't seen is a master of portraying despair and human emotion with versimilitudinal perfection. Boasting a diverse cast of some Arabs or Quasi Arabs (do you call them that?), Hispanics, Japanese (watch out!) and of course the amazing race who share Pitt and Blanchett's blood, some 3 or 4 individual story lines jump back and forth in a semi-nonlinear fashion or in a manner with temporal relativity as opposed to ""real time"" film duration.... but this isn't like the extreme disjointedness and anti-linearity of 21 GRAMS.Watch as Pitt and Blanchett search for solutions in their most dire moment, observe a Japanese adolescent in her search for identity (a girl whose father has an indirect connection with the Pitt/Blanchett storyline and the Arab people), and the extremely family oriented albeit reckless and neurotic family caretaker Amelia (was the girl Elle Fanning??).As it should in the literary flow of a screen play - the tension builds to its apex before denouement is brought about. And the inevitable resolve is almost like relief. Rather than having any theses on morales or reflections on the complexity of the human condition (which is what this story is about), the good or fairly satisfactory end arrives because it must... I also really liked some ambiguity in the end; what was the Jap girl's long letter all about?And contrasting the frantic hand-held cinematography of Innaritu is a beautiful closing shot which you just have to see the film to appreciate.",Babel
252,andy-933-696608,Babel movie review,10,8 January 2011,"The very tragedy that tells the film's story aspire into a global scale, pushing each brand of individual characters into their most desperate situations, where they are overtaken with grief, overwhelming decisions, and quite often negative consequences. The simple gift of rifle as a sign of gratefulness towards a hunting guide began this whole situation, creating a four story tragedy, that influenced each of the characters drastically. Two Morrocan boys, Yuseff and Ahmed decided to try their dad's new .270 Winchester rifle, hoping it can shoot at its promised 3 kilometer range, they idiotically take a shot at a bus of tourists, injuring an America named Susan (Blanchett) on vacation with her husband Richard (Pitt), a couple hoping to escape their own pain, for the 2 boys are in for a world of pain to come. Their vacation served but as forefront of their late infant child's death, baring their own anguish. Richard ran, and returned in shame, hoping to fix his marriage, only to face an ordeal that was all started in the hands of an innocent, but still unaware Japanese hunter, whose own Daughter has enough misery to feel, but none to say, nor to hear in her case. Cheiko, a teenage Japanese student, suffers from the pain of being a Deaf Mute, feeling unwanted by men sexually, and while still expressing her anger in the suicide of her mother. In her desperation to substitute her pain, Cheiko makes pass here and there to any guy, hoping for some form of sexual satisfaction, only to be shot down and hurt. Her pain is probably the most afflictive, knowing her limits, and thinking of herself as a monster, hoping to end her life the way she tell a detective curious enough to express curiosity in the matter of her Father's gone. When going back to Susan and Richard's crises, we take a trip to America, California, and see their kids in the care of their illegal immigrant maid, Amelia, who has been asked to watch over the kids, in the wake of Susan's long awaited operation. Being stubborn, and wanting to not miss her sons wedding in Mexico, Amelia takes a huge risk and crosses the border with the children, making it in time to make the marriage. As her return seems sure, her drunk nephew takes the wheel and pisses off the often suspicious border patrol, hoping to escape their pursuit. Upon their separation, all goes to Hell, as Amelia and the kids face life or death in a dessert, hoping to find help. Her arrest proves to be unavoidable, for her false residency is discovered, and her deportation becomes a reality, leaving the children unharmed and ashamed of her selfish mistakes. All these characters faced closer or seemingly similar brush with death, seeing what it brings them to do, and what it makes them feel in those extreme moments. Richard showed all the courage and determination, as well as the grief of his past mistakes to save his wife's life to the best of his abilities. Cheiko pursued her sexual desperation for attention, nearly driving herself to suicide, using a slightly false suicide story of her mother. Amelia nearly lost her life, while risking the lives of 2 children who nearly lost their lives. Yussef's curiosity and even his selfish desperation cost him and his family the life of his older brother, costing him to surrender in the wake of his rebellion towards the authorities. Director Alejandro Gonzalez introduces to audiences a film about the element of death, and the influences it can have. Babel in fact has made this his trilogy of death films. I myself have never seem any of his other films, but I sure as Hell plan on witnessing the genius that is ""21 Grams"", and ""Amores Perros"". I was very impressed by the Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, as her character Cheiko, using both well demonstrated sigh language, and just showing such silent forms of depression, making the sounds of her anguish often difficult to express. ""Babel"", I never really understood the title, however it reminds me of last years best picture winner ""Crash"" and how it outclasses it in the elements of Drama, and the pain it characters experience in the event of making difficult decisions.",Babel

254,Galagonya,Unusual kaleidoscope.,8,22 June 2007,"I am very pleased that eventually something decent has been awarded. The center of Babel, as is to be expected from the title, is the Babel-idea of all things in life intertwining. This is here supported by a very strong cast, story lines that go under the skin (yes they do, because they are all easy to relate to as they are so ordinary in a manner), and extraordinarily great music.The length is made up to a good extent of parts without dialog, where you have the pictures, the actors' faces and the music only. You might consider this the weak spot or the virtue of the film. I vote for the latter.The stories connect in a very slow pace. Although violence and action are very strongly present in the movie, the overall impression is that of some sort of timelessness and peacefulness, as all elements of the kaleidoscope slowly shift into their place.I think there is well room for criticism if you dissect the individual stories and analyze them under a microscope. Still, if the movie is viewed from the distance and the problems are perceived as abstractions of all problems (as Plato's ideas on the wall of the cave), Babel is an intriguing tale which fulfills its aim- it makes the point that the most unlikely events, people might be connected, as seen in an unusual superhuman kaleidoscope.",Babel

256,the-evil-cult,"Good Movie, but Unsatisfying, Superficial, and Stereotypical",7,30 June 2007,"Babel is a film by director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who was also the director of 21 Grams. Like 21 Grams, Babel is about different stories of people's lives, and all these stories are linked in some way. The movie stars Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett as American tourists. Elle Fanning, little sister of Dakota Fanning, plays one of the American parents' kids.After watching the film, the message that I took from it was that even though bad things happen, often there's nobody to blame. The tragedy happens because of a chain reaction of unfortunate events and bad luck.Unlike in 21 Grams, the different plot lines seem too independent. As a result, the film ends up looking like a collection of multiple short stories rather than one whole film itself.The movie, I though, felt very superficial and sometimes stereotypical. The American are just so superficially American with all the imagery and stereotypes emphasized to the extreme. The same can be said of the Mexicans and the Japanese. The real world is a complex mess, but while watching the movie I had the impression that the writer had a simplified perception of reality in his mind: Japanese people are like this, Americans are like that, a tragedy is supposed to use this kind of music, this kind of camera work, etc.While watching The Door in the Floor, another film with Elle Fanning, one of the characters in that movie talks about the art of telling a story. He says the following: ""Everything in fiction is a tool: pain, betrayal, even death. These are, you know, these are like, uh, different colors on a painter's palette. You need to use them."" The problem with this film is that, for me, it really seems as if the writer knew he wanted the film to be tragic and just dabbed the usual elements of a tragedy, lost kids, close-ups of people's faces as they cried, etc. With solemn music and scene after scene of people crying and walking around dazed, the film has all the imagery and tone of a tragedy. For me this story really felt like a story, as if all the parts were just put there for the sole purpose of manipulating the audience.",Babel
257,jon2005,Babel,7,4 April 2007,"Writer Guillermo Arriaga likes non-linear stories. He wrote the excellent Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, 21 Grams and Amores Perros, and now comes Babel, in his forth collaboration with director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Babel is the weakest of the aforementioned films, though not without its merits, and although it encompasses grand themes it can't quite keep up with itself, making the film feel forced and disjointed to the point of distraction.Babel tells the story of four families across three continents: in Morocco, husband and wife Richard and Susan (Pitt and Blanchett) are holidaying when tragedy strikes and Susan is accidentally shot by the child (El Caid) of a local goat farmer. He and his brother have to keep their involvement secret as paranoia has hit hard enough to convince the police that it was a terrorist attack. Back in Amercia, Richard and Susan's children are taken across the border to Mexico by their illegal immigrant nanny Amelia (Barraza) for her son's wedding, but end up stranded in the Mexican desert. Finally, in Japan, deaf-mute Chieko (Kikuchi) tries to lose her virginity with anyone and everyone, including school kids, her dentist, and a cop investigating the involvement of her father with the Moroccan shooting.As you can see, the four stories are all interlinked, but with varying degrees of success; although perhaps the strongest segment of the film, Chieko's story is the most tenuously linked. It really deserves its own film, and its inclusion in Babel feels a little at odds with the other stories. It is powerfully presented, drawing us in most successfully into Chieko's world  particularly of note during the nightclub scene, where we flick between the world's and Chieko's perspective, one moment feeling the atmosphere and noise in the club, then in total silence as we see the disorientation of Chieko's life without the ability to hear. Her simple need for human contact is excellently played by Kikuchi, and one feels that more should have been made of this segment, even at the expense of the others.The other stories are in varying degrees of development  in Mexico, the story is rushed, and despite an Oscar worthy performance by Barraza as the nanny, we are left with too many loose ends that have not been tied up. In Morocco, Brad Pitt, certainly looking the part of a father and husband affected by tragedy (one before and during the film), has little more to do than look upset and cry, although his heart-to-heart with wife Susan when she is on the brink of death is certainly moving. Similarly, Blanchett's role consists of lying on the floor dying, hardly an expansive role for an actress of her calibre. Still, they both portray the required emotions effectively, but again we are left wishing more could have been made of the story. Finally, the goat herders involvement is wonderfully acted by the two child newcomers, who are torn between secrecy at the atrocity they have committed, and the responsibility to do what it right, the latter only becoming clear when their lives are put in danger by the heavy-handed police.Babel is about (mis)communication and the universal causes of pain and grief across human civilisation, where nations may hold different values but react to stimuli in the same ways. Director Iñárritu does not give us answers, instead relying on his characters to damn or redeem themselves. Encompassing themes such as grief, prejudice, terrorism, and immigration, Babel certainly has something to say, but because of its style, cannot say all that is needed to be said. It feels disjointed when the point is to portray coherence in human reaction. It contains potentially excellent individual segments (as usual with Iñárritu, they are temporally mixed up) that do not quite gel well enough to create a rounded whole.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Babel
258,nick suess,missing pieces,6,5 February 2007,"Watching this movie was like trying to walk up a ""down"" escalator. You get worn out going nowhere. The political point was blatantly obvious, with the clash between developed nations and the third world being one where the latter always comes off worst. Yes, America exploits the rest of the planet, and you'd have to be Blind Freddie or George W Bush not to recognise that. Nothing new in that message, and not much subtlety in its delivery. The whole thing amounted to a jigsaw puzzle with several pieces missing. If I wanted a mystery I'd prefer an Agatha Christie.Only redeeming factor was the two ""best supporting"" nominees, and at least the ""500 things learned from Babel"" thread on the IMDb message board is a good giggle. 6/10",Babel

From Genesis 11:9 in the Bible: The name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.The third feature film from Alejandro González Iñárritu has continued his series of interrelated stories and united humanity. The story by collaborator Guillermo Arriaga, is more refined and linear than his previous efforts. However it may still a take a while for some to get adjusted to the configuration. But once the ball starts rolling, the events unfold like a domino effect - the discoveries are shattering and spellbinding.The story is told through 4 concurrent episodes.In the first story, a Moroccan family's life is transformed when the two young boys discover a gun. They go ""hunting"" across the smoky desert for whatever they can find. What they do with it has consequences for all the characters in the film.The second story concerns a couple holidaying in Morocco. They are experiencing issues in their marriage and with great frustration, are beginning to see the cracks in their relationship.The third story involves two young American children and their nanny. She has to travel to Mexico for her son's wedding and with great apprehension and affliction must take the children along. What they experience is an eye-opening adventure in a wild terrain in which they soon find themselves out of their depth.The final story takes place in contemporary Japan A teenage schoolgirl attempts deal with the increasing tension between herself and her father. She finds solace in her friends but struggles to connect to anyone in her everyday life.Iñárritu - in presenting stories that are varied and uniquely beautiful - is able to juxtapose deserts and civilisations while asserting that we are all under the same sun. Our actions reverberate among husbands and wives, fathers, and friends across the land.By his direction, the landscapes of Morocco, Mexico and Japan are infused in a rich melting point of civilizations and customs that breathe life into their inhabitants. The sands and the city engulf the characters push them into their greatest fears. Some end up struggling to survive in their nightmares.The performances are stunning across the board. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett make each breath count when they realise they are up to their necks. They are grasping at straws when they realise the situation is hopeless. Soon they have to make a resolution about their lives.Rinko Kikuchi is mesmerising in a world that is has alienated her. She is a fish out of water in a place that is consumed by sensory overload and the concept of communication by any means possible. She longs for a human touch so needed in a modern city lacking heart and soul.Adriana Barraza covers a spectrum of emotions during her wild road-trip into Mexico. We are along with her for the ride over the border and back. She manages under pressure to get in Mexico, jubilant to see her son, and realises her worst fears when in the desert and forced to contemplate her future.Part mystery, heavily a thriller, the suspense is asphyxiating by the climax of the film. Once the clues all tessellate, you realise it can only end one way. Part of the ride is seeing the characters arrive at their conclusion - for their fears catch up with them before they can escape.Worth mentioning is the composer Gustavo Santaolalla who has composed a stunning score of delectable variety. Ranging the primitive, wild sands of Morroco to cross to a pacey thriller as we race against time to save a woman from dying. The festivities in Mexico become a forbidding land of high-rise and neon signs in ToykoIt's fantastic to see how it resolves and all fits into place. I was thoroughly rewarded and moved at the way the relationships in the film resolve. It was a complex and puzzling idea that these characters could learn to communicate albeit existing on several continents and speaking different languages. Hopefully we might learn to sift through the material banalities in our lives and learn to listen before judging one another.",Babel
260,ashi-lance,Babel (2006),8,27 August 2013,"ONE LINE REVIEW: ""Babel is a wonderfully Crafted, thought-provoking and powerful film that is highly recommended to people who have taste for International Cinema.""""Babel"" is a deep and multi-layered movie which follows various story lines to get its complex points across to a wide range of audience members. In Morocco, a troubled American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) become part of an international firestorm when the latter is shot in a freak accident which traps the duo in a small, primitive village with no medical attention. Across the world a deaf teenager (Rinko Kikuchi) in Tokyo struggles for acceptance and existence as she tries to come to terms with her mother's death, a father who is rarely around due to his work, and her budding discovery of her sexuality. Meanwhile, an illegal Mexican nanny (Adriana Barraza) in California decides to take her two young charges (Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble) south of the border with her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) so she can attend her son's wedding. A seemingly innocent situation though turns potentially dangerous for all involved due to misunderstandings, coincidences, and bad luck. Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (known for his modern home-runs like ""Biutiful "" and ""21 Grams"") goes beyond the cinematic realm of excellence here with an intriguing concept of utilizing several languages, along with the sign language, to get cinematic narratives across to produce a movie that has appeal among masses all around the globe. ""Babel"", involving three stories, four countries and several different languages, is a hugely ambitious work, and that ambition has paid off. All three stories succeed as powerful and moving human dramas; their juxtaposition, which in less skillful hands could have seemed like a cheap gimmick, here has the effect of intensifying the power of the storytelling. The film well deserved its ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"" nominations for Academy Awards.MY RATING: 8/10",Babel
261,Syrchek,I'm sure it's about something mutual to all of us.,8,12 January 2007,"First, why I think it's called Babel (Babylon). Check out the 32nd parallel of geographical latitude. It goes right from beneath the US-Mexican border, thru the mountains of Morocco, and thru Japan's most southern island Kyushu. And geographical coordinates are a system which was invented by the Babylonians. The point of it is to express every location on earth.I think that's what the director was mainly trying to do. I don't think that it's just a dumb coincidence that the characters are at the places they are. The director was trying to express different places and meanwhile showing that there's a common dimension within them and people. The dimension isn't just latitude, but perhaps fate. On all three places people are experiencing something very similar.The tag line goes: If You Want to be Understood...Listen. The ancient tower of Babel is also a very important allegory. It's known that it's used in Judeo-Christian context to explain the existence of many different languages and races. In the allegory God destroyed the tower to prevent the efforts of humans to create a unified language and race. The point of the film isn't that we have to learn different languages to understand each other, but we have to LISTEN.The poor Mexican woman will get sent back 'home', because nobody listens to what she's saying. All because of her nephew running away from the boundary patrol. She is very much misunderstood and accused. At the next location an innocent man get's beaten up and an innocent boy gets killed, no fault of theirs. All because of one pointless shot. They are both misunderstood and accused. A girl in Japan is as lonely as can be, because she cannot speak to 'ordinary' people. They don't listen. She is getting accused with filthiness, although she wants something completely pure. She is as much as others, misunderstood and accused.If we won't listen carefully, innocent people will keep getting hurt. I think Iñárritu prepared us a very humane story. Something that's very apt for consideration. I guess that's what makes a movie great. That it's worth to consider it, instead of seeing and forgetting all about it. And by now this is honestly the best movie I've seen from the previous year. I wish there were more........... +4/5 ........",Babel
262,Solipsisticblog,An ambitious intimate epic,9,26 December 2006,"Like a rich novel, Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's new film is a multi-story globe trotting tale about mortality, language, xenophobia, coincidence, and fate. The film does not succeed completely, but its ambition, performances, and scope make it an intimate epic worth seeing.Innaritu's film tells four separate stories--two Moroccan shepherd boys are given a rifle to guard their flock, two American tourists (Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt) have their lives abruptly shattered by a random act of violence, a Mexican nanny takes her young American charges across the border to her son's wedding, and a deaf-mute Japanese teenager struggles to define herself during an evening of club hopping. As the movie progresses, the stories begin to converge and become one larger tale. This works less well with the story of the Japanese teenager whose connection to the larger story feels more forced, but in and of itself this segment is one of the film's best.Innaritu creates a palpable sense of dread in each of the tales. We realize that no character is going to emerge from these stories unscathed and we anxiously wait to see the outcome of their galvanizing moment. It is an exhausting, fascinating experience that may be too intense for many viewers. For the brave and adventurous, however, this movie will be a welcome and exciting alternative to the calm, safe Oscar-bait of the season.",Babel
263,Hint523,Too many loose ends,7,26 March 2007,"Babel's plot line isn't very simple. But to cut to the chase, it's about a gun in Morrocco that causes problems, a Mexican nanny at the wrong place at the wrong time, and a deaf-mute in Japan.Everything works well. The 5 major characters are introduced and followed well, and problems in these characters are blatant from the start. The director uses a lot of cool directing techniques. My most favorite scene is in the dance club. It goes on for two and a half hours and is exciting through most of the way. But the problem is this: it drops off all of a sudden. There are so many parts of the story left unexplained completely, and it doesn't feel over when it ends. Plus, the director gets caught up when he tries to mix-and-match things that happened at different times. I think this film was good, but the scale is too epic and the director leaves too many things out of the picture. I think he probably was trying too hard.",Babel

I can't feel sorry for a woman who takes someone's children out of the country then gets in a car with a drunk relative. I can feel sorry for the Japanese girl, but what was that story line in this movie for, anyway? And frankly, what was the whole Mexico story line in this movie for? They were ancillary to the central conflict, but I guess without them, you'd see how underdeveloped and weak that story is. No character development, no twists turns or reveals. Just predictable, pat melodrama.This movie is four weak stories threaded together by a weak plot device, with some America bashing thrown in for good measure. Without that last element, this film would have been forgotten. But since Paramount Vantage seems to be about finding films like this, it got attention and a release far greater than it deserved.I thought Children of Men was a bit over rated and ridiculous, but Babel makes that movie look like the Godfather.",Babel
265,auberus,There are films fueled with emotions...Babel is one of them,8,20 November 2006,"Babel is four stories taking place on three continents. But Babel is one story taking place everywhere and everydayThose stories respond to, bounce of, echo to each other like a dialog that struggle to get through. This ""crossing stories"" narrative technique is not innovative (Altman, Lelouch). However in Babel it is efficiently and brilliantly used as it provides the cement to a complex dynamic and gives a sense of progressions to the overall plot. I can easily understand why Alejandro González Inárritu (21 grams) won the Cannes prize for the best ""mise en scène"" as the narrative is fully mastered, the editing is pristine and the overall direction is detailed and to the point. Every single actor (known or less known) serve a flawless scenario and an unquestionable demonstration on our inability to communicate, and our ability to build obstacles so we are sure we don't look further than what we know of each other Fueled with sometimes crude emotions and very strong images, Babel succeeds in bringing closure to the four stories by triggering in our heart the one emotion that countssincerity",Babel

It rambles endlessly from dullness to extreme boredom. It tosses in a couple of Hollywood type political comments which are meaningless. It is more like a bad soap opera than anything else. The only purpose of the Japan segments must have been to have an excuse to have a naked girl on display. It insults Americans, British, Arabic, Japanese, cops, embassies, men, women and children. Those who put this movie together must have been on some drug induced binge, or worst.

It was also exceedingly well-acted.However, after about the 90 minute part I couldn't't wait for it to end.Political points in the movie were hammered home, but some of the plot devices were just altogether unbelievable. If one had to summarize what happens to Brad Pitt's character and his entire family, they would have renamed the movie ""Job."" It would have been more engrossing to have these individual segments as movies unto themselves. Having the incomplete segments constantly start and stop, consistently without closure or temporal relation, was really tiring after awhile.Additionally, the scene that takes place in Asia does not even effectively interact with the rest of the movie, save for the plot device that actually connects that thread.I gave it a 7, because it is well-crafted, however, I did not find it an edifying experience.I cannot imagine ever sitting through it again.",Babel

270,timbermisc,40% art film; 40% adult audience film 20% anthropology,8,6 November 2006,"This film requires a higher I.Q., and a higher level of empathy and intuition to perceive its core value. You will be searching, searching for the tie that binds the personal motives and actions of people in several cultures together. Why are we going to Japan, then Morocco, then to the Mexican border you will ask yourself time and time again. This movie is an exquisite puzzle, yet the answers are mostly revealed and thy are simple.The path to these simple answers will lead you on a gut-wrenching path. Think of the book ""Family of Man"". Several cultures are presented in pictures, yet a found personal quality threads the separate cultures together in a story book. Well, the ""personal quality"" in Babel will not simply touch your heart, it will grab your chest and make you squirm in your seat.After reading some of the negative comments about the movie, I realize that these people were largely tuned-out to begin with. One said there was no happiness in the movie: wrong. Remember the wedding scene? Weddings are happy, right? Right! There was a joke (racist) about Mexicans, and this was funny. And the Japanese girls had kooky motivations for attracting boys; this was slyly amusing and cute. So, I have proved that not all comments on this board are accurate! This movie requires that you go in with an open mind. Some say that elements of the movie are not plausible. Well, if you keep up with the newspapers, you will read incredible true stories daily. What can't be plausible? Because I have a communications degree, I may have ""picked up"" on a method to enjoy this film more quickly than others have especially the ones who posted comments which were negative. I would advise anyone to look for any ""moments of communication confusion"". Furthermore, look for moments when the actor/actress has a need to communicate. Then ask yourself this question: ""What motives her/him to need this communication?"" When you concentrate on these moments, using your intuition, slowly you will build a ""Family of Man"" type of 'book' that will reveal the sameness of all people under all cultures, irregardless of our ability or inability to communicate easily with one another. Am I being too high-minded here? Well this film is high minded. It is not made for simple ""entertainment"". You may be brought to a higher understanding of people from other cultures here. You will likely leave your chair stunned, gripped, and questioning the ending. But another thing may happen to you; and I will explain what it did to me: As I left the theater speechless, still gripped by the exquisite ending, I tried to communicate with people in the lobby what I had just experienced. Immediately, my emotions took over, and I, yes, babbled an explanation. I looked at the admiring faces of people in line. They smiled at me like they were looking at a baby babbling! I had lost myself in this explanation. Then, I tried to find another person to explain it to, and they listened, and I babbled and I lost myself in my communication. And they smiled; and I felt I had said nearly nothing! Then I realized that this movie had made me temporarily transcend myself and I could see myself needing to communicate to complete strangers, to connect, to pour out my feelings and I felt very, very alone. Soon, I tried another set of strangers farther from the movie, and they simply looked at me for a second and ignored me instantly. A failed connection. I had become an actor in this movie! --After this movie ended! I was a player in Act 4, scene 3 of Babel! I became part of it because I was seeing my own lonely attempt to communicate to strangers succeed and fail. Some players in the movie will fail to communicate because they are drugged, hurt, on the run, angry at the world, cowardly, needing attention, mute, hemmed in by cultural conditions, lost in a quandary, and puzzled. (and more) The costumes changed, the countries changed, the people changed, but this exquisite gold thread connected everyone in one human condition.If you have taken anthropology in college, you will be far better equipped to quickly accept the life styles of the people presented. As such, you can spend more time looking for those moments when strangers succeed and fail to communicate, and less time thinking of this and that impossibility happening in a foreign country. In another words, be the anthropologist and simply record what you see without a filter of American judgmental values. Drop your white middle class value system as the screen lights up. Sit back, and accept what you will see.It took me 3 hours after the movie to even slightly ""come out of it"". I had to call friends to unload my feelings. I never drink beer, and I had to have a beer. A day later, I am still shocked. This movie held me so strongly, that I doubt I can ever see it again for a long, long time.I am a professional photographer by trade.",Babel
271,Weredegu,"A ""Coke bottle"" can be funny!",7,11 February 2007,"If you have seen 'The Gods Must Be Crazy', you know what I'm talking about. The plot, here, too, is set off by a 'Coke bottle', so to say, falling out of the sky - a proverbial one, of course. But unlike in the case of 'TGMBC', here everything is painted dark. Interactions, global in reach, bring about tragic misunderstandings and unintended negative consequences - I'll say TMs and UNCs from here on, to emphasize that I feel rather ambivalently about this, considering this somewhat routine-like, technique-like, taking away from the authenticity or the soul of the movie. Why can't we talk with more humor about globalization, about how our world is becoming more interdependent? Can we only take the managers' point of view, sitting concerned over lap-tops, worried that things are currently in a sub-optimal arrangement, or, so-to-say, the anti-managers' point of view, that of self-victimization, the perspective of subdued anti-globalizers, who are concerned that everything is going all out wrong? Come on, a Coke bottle falling out of the sky doesn't have to massacre families to be taken seriously (to give an abstract example of a UNC), the laughter of a surprised passer-by can give it significance, too. And even then a script-writer and a director can have the chance to smuggle in some sobering message about the limited way in which we can control (or understand) consequences of our actions, no matter where we are coming from and how educated we are (in which they'll inevitably be right, of course). So why do I still give 7 out of 10 points to this movie? Because apart from the concept there was nothing else that I would complain about. Good directing, good editing (I really appreciated the way the film kept cutting away from scenes in the four countries, where the plot takes place, with really intelligent timing, always adding to the tension of the story). The actors were also very good all around, from young to old, from Eastern to Western, from star to non-star in the line-up. So I don't want to burst the bubble on 'Babel', you can still do it yourself, if you like it less than me.",Babel
272,kaustubh-rajnish,Gimmicky pseudo intellectual cinema with no common sense,5,2 October 2008,"Lets face it good films were so hard to come by in 2006, that anything shot dramatically with realism and with enough pauses and requiring effort to understand gets mistaken for poetry and social commentary of the highest order. I have never understood why Alejandro González Iñárritu films are never in chronological order or why distant stories are shown to reach points of excitement and then cut to other stories to give you a sense of curiosity but nothing more. Its like the initial pages of the political pulp fiction of Forsythe / Ludlum where seemingly disconnected characters and incidents unfold interlaced such that you keep turning pages due to more curiosity than actual interest. In Amores perros the three stories were frankly disconnected but made great watching. 21 grams was just gimmicky cinema according to me heavily borrowing from Blue.Babel is no different except this time the stories cut across cultures and continents (assuming since Alejandro's clientèle is now across the world) Just like 21 grams and amores perros, an accident (if you can call it that) interlink three stories. While one could see some political commentary in the Moroccan and Mexican story about politics complicating lives, the Tokyo story had no connection what so ever , a lame connection of the gun was just not enough. I mean if someone could please explain why couldn't the three stories be totally different films or would it have mattered if they were. (yaa! maybe to the length of the film)Again the actions in the film of the people concerned do not seem to make sense, the lawmen both shown in Morocco and Us-Mexico are unnecessarily aggressive and a little too trigger happy. The American tourists are a little too unconcerned assuming that one of their co passengers have been shot out of nowhere and the Mexican cousin (Gabriel Garcia) is a little too jumpy......all potential behaviors to proceed and complicate the stories further. Not to mention if Brad Pitt has to wait so long why not use the bus as an ambulance and head to a city anyways.The toughest to get the point is of the Tokyo story....a deaf and mute girl is frustrated with her inability to attract the opposite sex leading to a poignant moment later in the film but the point frankly i couldn't get, except feeling bad about the teenage girl (played beautifully by Rinko Kikuchi)Of course there is an underlying theme that even though problems look tough it is the inability to communicate that are the cause of almost all problems. Hence the name babel referring to the biblical tower of silence of the same name. But come on how much does it require for a person to understand that medical help is needed if a person is shot or a deaf and dumb depressed teenager would want some acceptance and a boyfriend.To make it look intellectual, the editing throughout keeps you curious (not interested) as each story keeps getting cut and getting mixed across.Overall another gimmicky pseudo intellectual effort from an overrated director. Kindly give us common sensical cinema but less pointless editing any day. This would easily join the ranks of similarly toned Crash as one of the most overrated ever.Only recommended if you haven't really seen good cinema but still want to talk as if you have.",Babel

275,Doc-134,A Powerful Conclusion to Iñárritu's Trilogy,9,11 March 2007,"""Babel"" represents director Alejanrdo Gonzalez Iñárritu's conclusion to a trilogy that begins with ""Amores Perros"" and continues with ""21 Grams"". That being said, if you have seen either of those films and did not like them, it is probably fair to assume that you will not like ""Babel"" either. Thematically and stylistically, this film continues in the same direction, but increases in scope, illustrating that one incident can trigger a devastating series of events all around the globe.Like ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" is constructed as a puzzle, with different pieces transpiring during different times and in different places. Many viewers will no doubt see similarities to Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" which explores similar issues; however Iñárritu's piece places more emphasis on human emotion and requires the viewer to be much more participative in the interpretation of themes and ideas.The film is set into motion when the young sons of a Moroccan goat herder get careless with a new rifle and accidentally shoot an American tourist (Cate Blanchett) traveling with her husband (Brad Pitt). This one act sets off a series of tragedies with global implications. American officials interpret this as an act of terrorism and of course the media reflects this accordingly. There is a story of the couple's undocumented nanny who juggles taking care of their kids while attending her own son's wedding in Mexico. In my favorite story, a deaf Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) struggles with her mother's recent suicide and a father who is emotionally distant. This story doesn't reveal its connection to the others until late in the film, but it is undoubtedly the most poignant.At its core, ""Babel"" is about the difficulty of human communication and even though stories unfold in four different countries and in five languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, and Sign); language is far from the principal obstacle. This film is more concerned with cultural assumptions and biases that tend to obscure reality and how our perceived differences keep us from connecting to each other. There are many reasons to recommend ""Babel"", but most of all because of its astounding ability to cope with issues of global importance while also presenting characters whose individual struggles are no less compelling.",Babel

277,superduperspit,"Almost a masterpiece, terrific Oscar material!",9,12 November 2006,"After the success that films about multiple stories have had in recent years (Crash, Traffic), it's not much of a surprise that another one would be made that explored a different important topic in today's world. Babel decides to deal with how the inability to communicate (think of the Christian Tower of Babel) can lead to a reaction that affects a total of twelve people over the course of four stories. Alejandro González Iñárritu made this film with both Crash and Traffic in mind, but obviously was going for a different approach to the genre. The main problem that his film faces is that the stories don't connect in as brilliant a way as both Crash and Traffic do; however, he still presents us with a gritty look into the lives of very different people. The film begins when a father buys his two boys a gun to kill animals in the area where they live. Within a few hours of having the gun to themselves, the boys become curious as to how far the bullets from the gun can travel, and decide (of course) to aim it right at a bus passing by and see if they hit it. The bus doesn't seem to react to their shot, but soon they see it pull off to the side of the road, and realize that they did in fact hit it.This brings us into our second story. An American couple (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in nearly Oscar-worthy performances) is on a vacation that they aren't at all enthusiastic about. While their bus is driving them back home, the bullet from the gun that these two boys shot flies through the window and hits Susan (Blanchett) very close to her heart. Richard (Pitt) frantically tries to get something done. However, he is in a country where there are nearly no people that speak his language, so he has much trouble communicating with anybody off the bus what has happened and what he needs to get done. This leads us to our third story, which focuses on Amelia (played by Adriana Barraza in the most powerful performance of the movie) and her journey across the American border and back with the two kids she baby-sits as well as Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), a relative of hers who is going with her to her son's wedding. Getting to Mexico works just fine for them thanks to special routes that ignore border patrol, but they are in a hurry on the way back and are faced with horrible problems from there on out.The last story, and the story that I think threw this otherwise phenomenal film off, was a story that takes place in Tokyo, revolving around the story of a depressed deaf girl who is going through a terrible phase in her life. Being a teenager, she is very interested in guys, but her deafness gives her a retarded appearance to them, and she is very unhappy to know that she is still a virgin. On top of this, her mother had just committed suicide, throwing her into an even deeper depression. In my opinion, the other three stories (the story of the two boys and the gun, the American couple, and the nanny's trip across the border) were all brilliantly told and linked in very powerful ways. Although this story works out very well, it doesn't connect well to the other three stories, creating a flaw in fantastic work. With the problems aside, the ensemble work is phenomenal (from Barraza's Oscar worthy work to the great performances of Pitt and Blanchett to the small roles of Clifton Collins Jr. and Michael Pena to the child performance of Elle Fanning, Dakota's sister), with each character being faced with a struggle that they are forced to try and overcome. The script, unlike Crash's, never goes too far and stays very down-to-earth, making the film much more plausible. If it hadn't been for the noticeable error of trying to incorporate the Tokyo story into the other three, this would easily be one of the year's best films. Regardless, this is the kind of film that has a very strong shot at receiving a Best Picture nomination, as it is terrific Oscar material.By Billybob Washare, written for http://www.boxofficefanatic.com",Babel
278,arighnachatterjee,The powerful conclusion,8,2 August 2020,"The last film of Iñarritu's death trilogy & the successor to 21 grams. It is based upon the themes of parent- child relationship, strained spouse relationship, sexualities frustration & of course, death. The film has a certain heaviness in it which can be felt from the starting itself. Babel connects four stories in a back & fro style -
A couple with a strained relationship out on a holiday to sort things out gets caught in an accident.
The kids of the couple at home and their caretaker caught in a legal misunderstanding.
A poor native family at the holiday destination unintentionally becomes the cause of the accident.
A Japanese family hundreds of miles away becomes the source of the cause of the accident.
Brad Pitt was definitely good in playing Richard.
Cate Blanchett though didn't have much performing spotlight.
Rinko kikuchi as Chieko Wataya was commendable in acting.The film had bright tone to it and was desaturated at times.
Nothing extraordinary in cinematography though quite vibrant.The story continuity was somewhat similar to Pulp Fiction. The storytelling was really interesting and keeps you hooked.",Babel
279,asalem182,"Great Direction and Acting, Meh Everything Else",7,22 March 2007,"After Crash won the Best Picture Oscar in 2006, ""important"" films that deliver their messages through multiple, interconnected, stories became the ""in"" thing in Hollywood. Crash was the first film, Babel is another one, and even Tom Cruise has his own version, Lions for Lambs, which comes out later this year. So far, these films (of course, Babel included) have closely followed some rules:1) Rely heavily on coincidences. 2) Have a story that will make you feel terrible about yourself, only to realize it's OK to commit sins, ""because we're only human beings"". 3) Have an A-lister (Brad Pitt) crying and/or cursing and/or shouting. 4) Apparently, they must have a scene that will cause huge, unintentional laughter (In Babel, it was Pitt making out with a near-dead Cate Blanchett who had just peed her pants).Babel's intent was to show us the disastrous results of bad (or lack of) communication between people from different cultures. The different stories were set in Japan, Mexico, and Morocco. And that's where the film starts to falter. I felt only the Japan section served the story, the other two, not so much. The Mexico segment was unfocused and took too much time to get going (a good 15-20 minutes could've been easily trimmed), while the Moroccan one was unbelievable for the most part. Maybe that's why I only felt emotionally connected to the deaf-mute Japanese girl (played by Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi). I couldn't care less about the other characters.Babel is the concluding chapter of director Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Death Trilogy"", after Amores Perros and 21 Grams. Iñárritu has definitely improved as a director. Take the scenes in the Southern California desert for instance. They had an excellent raw and gritty feel to them. The Japan scenes, on the other hand, were suitably cold and depressing. Iñárritu was also able to get amazing performances from the majority of his big cast. But unfortunately, the story, structure, and pacing all failed him.So, I wouldn't really recommend Babel, unless you're a movie buff who likes to watch all the films nominated for best picture. If you're just looking for an entertaining, or a really well made flick, I'm afraid you should look somewhere else.",Babel
280,unapalomablanca,Not for the weak at heart,8,31 March 2008,"Babel is the story of three stories, four rather, and how they are interconnected. It is also a story of how a single turn of a page can affect the world.I like Babel. The thing that I praise the most in this movie is acting. All the characters-- from the major to even the policemen all delivered natural and riveting performances. I give props to Rinko Kikuchi, who portrayed a deaf-mute character without viewers thinking ""she hears it at all!"". She needed no words to actually impart the emotions she wishes to express! Adrianna Barranza is also an actress to watch for! Her deportation scene was full of raw emotion.The scene where the police attack Hassan Ibrahim was very heart-grabbing, as the actor portraying Hassan gave a performance that would have viewers empathizing with him, especially when he was kicked repeatedly! The scene where Abdullah slaps his children had me cringing and actually feeling the strength of those slaps! Acting is definitely superb! Sound is another thing I praise. The guitar strum score gives the movie emotion. I also loved it when they removed the sound in order for the viewers to ""experience"" what Rinko Kikuchi's character actually ""hears"". The editing is also something to praise, as it captures different scenarios-- chaos, energy, love, loneliness and despair.The downside to Babel is that there is a loose weave on the story-weaving Iñarritu planned. The Japan-Morocco link was somewhat unsatisfying, and although the ""start + end"" twists are amazing, I think the movie still needs to follow rules of chronology.Babel is indeed a movie that has so many meanings-- some are etched in the back of the VCD, some are actually found throughout the film. Although some might think that the movie will work itself out, think again. Listening is definitely the secret skill in unlocking the complexity of this movie.Final say? Babel is a knockout film that does not compromise the most important details of a film to knock the viewer out cold. However, the movie is not for the weak at heart, as it shows some servings of violence that might haunt the viewer. And as the Japanese said, the movie is a health hazard!",Babel

This movie is one constant, relentless DRAIN. It's not ""depressing"" or ""violent"" or anything that I can put my finger on. It's just emotionally draining. Afterwards, I felt like a shell and didn't feel that I came away with anything.There are 4 story lines. Three of them (the American couple, the poor family who live in the mountains, and the Mexican nanny) are all horrid stories designed to suck all the energy out of us. I can't really see any other point. Oh, except to enforce the theme of ""miscommunication"". And ""never get into a car with a drunk Gael Garcia Bernal"".However, the 4th storyline is a great one and almost makes Babel worth seeing. A Japanese deaf-mute teenage girl feels ugly, unloved, like a monster - perpetually cut off from the world. So she starts reaching out to other humans in all the wrong ways.

I don't say that BABEL doesn't have its strenghts. Acting (every single acting scene) is fine; cinematography is spectacular; the beduines story in Marokko is truly tragical and politically instructive - but the WHOLE thing is just too much.

Adriana truly sacrificed to deliver her heart-rending performance. And we didn't get to see enough of Cate Blanchett in this.Inarritu certainly displayed his spectacular visual technique and his skill with both known and unknown actors.However, this had a forced feeling to it.

I just don't think it's the best movie of the year or even one of the five best. (Actually, it's not on my ten best for the year.)",Babel

The movie basically revolves around 4 sub-plots.. each depicting the lives of 4 different families...There is an American couple who is almost near to a break-up (in my opinion), which is trying to find the happiness again..their children across the Mexican border who are entering the real world with a lot of prejudices... A Japanese girl, who is in search of humanly happiness called SEX and a Mexican nanny who is divided between family and job..Director Alejandro Gonzalez has done a great job extracting the true emotions of every actor that appears in the movie..The movie depicts that ""The good and evil within humans is because of the situations and not because of the race or creed to which he belongs........"" This movie is definitely one of the greatest I have ever seen..",Babel
286,forindcine,A tough look at an accident can trigger worldly percussions,7,10 February 2007,"Every once in a while I see a film which won't let go of me.Babel, a film by the young and serious Mexican writer and director, Alejandro González Iñárritu continues to play in my mind. Inarritu has directed two of my favorite films Amores Perros and 21 Grams. All three of these films have no nonsense themes with multiple story lines all, which reveal a connection as the film plays itself.In Babel, you get four stories, a young seemingly depressed teen and her dad in Tokyo, a Mexican nanny and housekeeper living in San Diego needing to attend her son's wedding in Mexico, young brothers minding a herd of sheep in Morocco and an American couple traveling through northern Africa.The film rotates between each storyline, all very intense, emotional and at times hard to watch. You will not be entertained by this film but for those interested in being encompassed with how serious events in different parts of this shrinking world can be miss-communicated based on individual perspectives, Babel is a film to see.You may walk out of the theater drained and exhausted but you will gain another important aspect of life for people outside our borders.",Babel
287,timlittle,Pretentious nonsense,2,3 June 2015,"Fifty minutes into this film and I was beyond restless - nothing of interest had happened to the contrived, non-sensical story lines that dragged across the globe like a deflated balloon.I found none of the characters elicited any sympathy or interest, but stuck with it in the hope that it would improve or that I could, at least, claim credit for having sat through a 'worthy' film.Then I began to look at some reviews and read some of the fatuous, pretentious twaddle written by people attempting to interpret the directors intentions and meaning. I get the 'communication' thing but fail to see the relevance. More than a few reviews reminded me of a visit to a second rate gallery years ago with an acquaintance who was a similar bore, spewing forth on the artists' vision and motivation on any and every exhibit.Anyway, I digress. It seems the Moroccan Police have solved the crime in no time at all and someone is getting married in Mexico. I'm sure that this often happens in Mexico but it holds no interest for me. This wedding is no different.Now - Brad Pitt. What was he thinking ? I know he's certainly not above appearing in the odd bad film but what was it about this that appealed to him ? His performance is adequate,(he even gets a little frustrated at one point) as are most of the cast but nothing more. I suspect without the cast list, this offering of cynical, depressing bile would have sunk without trace.The cinematography is good but on occasions labours the point (if there is one) such as in the nightclub that seemed to go on forever, and the locations striking (though it won't have done much for Japanese tourism as most of the occupants of that country appear to be dysfunctional, degenerate misfits - maybe they are I don't know).The odd scene is, obviously, thrown in for shock value and have emotional impact (chicken slaying) but they just appear absurd and misplaced. In fact, the whole of the Mexican storyline is ludicrous and way beyond belief - and if they're all this stupid (which I'm sure they're not) maybe they don't deserve to be able to cross the border.There's not many films where I fail to find any redeeming qualities, but this artsy guff is the closest I've come to for some time. If this is how the maker really sees the world, I feel sorry for him.I'm off now to recruit some Moroccans into our local Police force...",Babel
288,newguy85,A really pointless movie,5,2 April 2010,"I may be in the minority here, but I thought this movie was terrible. One reviewer said it was very exhausting, and I would have to agree. I continually checked the run time to make sure it wasn't approaching 4 hours, only to discover that it had been running for 1:53 and the Netflix envelope clocked it at 2:00.I understand what it was trying to accomplish; four stories of people from different backgrounds that are on a collision course because of stupid mistakes they make, and the conflicts they face to resolve their situations. But I didn't really feel like any of the characters were developed enough to care about them, nor was there enough plot to keep things moving.The movie was just, so, dull.I was also thoroughly creeped out by the Japanese girl's desire for sex, and her means to try and get it. I don't feel like it drove the story in any real direction other than the gutter.Just because a movie has overlapping stories, subtitles for 3 different languages, and edginess, it does not mean it's good.",Babel
289,annoman,...one that will resonate through audiences with the likes of such classics as Taxi Driver and 2005's Crash!,9,22 October 2006,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has become a director so emotionally depleting that when one leaves the theater after seeing one of his films, they are left naked and vulnerable to the world's truths; both uplifting and heart-breaking. Any film that can have that kind of effect on its viewers is more than noteworthy; it's impressive. That being said, 'Babel' is more than impressive! The film's outline plays as this: Over the span of three continents, one shot of a rifle will entangle the lives of those which have never been acquainted; A married American couple touring in the vast emptiness of the Moroccan landscape who's lives will be shattered; two Moroccan boys, who fire the rifle while herding goats; a nanny illegally passing through the borders of Mexico with the children of the American couple; and a rebellious Japanese teenager who isolates herself from the love of her father, who is being sought after by the police in the metropolis of Tokyo. This film reiterates the ancient story of Babel, in which mankind's unwillingness to co- reside and communicate efficiently with one another has brought to our world confusion and chaos. The photography is nothing short of awe-inspiring and the technical aspects of the film, like its editing, are clear-cut so as to leave the audience virtually tasting the sand of the Morrocan desert. The acting ensemble, led by Brad Pitt and Academy Award-winner Cate Blanchett, is perfectly cast and among the best of the year. Pitt, who seems to be coming into his own as one of the best actors available, is so convincing as the frantic husband trying desperately to save his dying wife, that Bernal, who seemingly constitutes his character with ease, is left in the glare of the Moroccan sun! The film's intensity spawns from the emotion of each actor, which, in all cases, pours from within their despairing characters. 'Babel' is so amazing because it says so much more of humanity than we often hear and forces steadily what we seemingly intend to ignore. Among the film's four stories, the most saddening follows Chieko, a deaf-mute teenager repressed from social contact beyond her volleyball teammates, who has lost herself in her own sexual desire and isolation. She's completely vacillating in her trust for all of those around her, including her father, who she's shunned with frustrated rage. To be frank, there really are no uplifting stories here; only ones that open your heart to the tragedies of the world; though they shine with peculiar beauty. Inarritu has outdone himself with this one, crafting his most gut-wrenchingly intense film yet, and one that will resonate through audiences with the likes of such classics as 'Taxi Driver' and 2005's 'Crash!' If one thing can be said in the defense of this year's other dramas, it's that 'Babel' may be too in-depth with its characters; and, with a running time of nearly two and a half hours, will become a flaw in the minds of many who mean to oversee its uncompromised greatness.",Babel
290,ctg0724,garbage,2,16 March 2007,"Here is a movie that tried to be as good as Traffic or Syriana but didn't even come close. At least in those movies, everything that happened had a reason behind it.To think that this movie is praised for Oscar worthiness makes me sick. The only reason it was even considered any good was because of the loose style of multiple characters. I could do a movie about lack of communication with a normal plot about one character and it would be forgotten in a day.Another problem with this movie was the unnecessary things that were shown in it. I almost turned the movie off after I saw the child beating off in the mountains. Everything that the deaf girl did was meaningless to the story, not to mention disturbing. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to have sympathy for the Mexican nanny for being deported or be angry at her for bringing American kids to a wedding in Mexico that has boos and chickens getting their heads ripped off.The film was depressing and left nothing but empty feeling. The only reason i give it more than one star was because Brad Pitt was at the top of his game. He should win an Oscar one of these days.",Babel

I now wish my car had flown off a cliff into the ocean killing us all because this movie is worse than death. It's slow torture. I walked out because Brad Pitt isn't the most horrible thing in this movie (although he comes close with his vomit-inducing ""acting""). It's the stories, that ugly woman Kate Blanchett, and the ass-numbing BORDOM. This movie is for eggheaded losers who think to understand a movie you need to read books on philosophy and film theory. Brad Pitt is hardly even in this movie and just goes to show the ads are a trick to get your cash. Stay away...I'd tell you more about it's suckiness but my friends and I walked out.",Babel
292,PortugalOle7,Outstanding and Oscar-Worthy.,10,10 November 2006,"This one will surely be mentioned this coming Oscar season. Believe the hype. It has it all, great direction, acting, story, and visuals.4 story lines that coincide with each other are what makes Babel a great film. I was immediately reminded about Traffic, another film I really like. They are all connected not just by the film's theme but the stories overlap as a result from previous events. What makes Babel different from Traffic is that the film goes back and fourth in time, not just between the stories. By the end of the film you will be saying ""if this didn't happen then...."".This is Brad Pitt's best work since 12 Monkeys in my opinion. It's probably because he's just being a normal guy, a loving husband, and father. While Pitt is the headline star here, it doesn't necessarily mean he's in the bulk of the film, in fact he is probably in the film around 30 minutes in total. The film is strengthened by an ensemble of actors who are relatively unknown.The plot revolves around Pitt and his wife Cate Blanchett who are vacationing in Morocco. Blanchett is subsequently shot and the mayhem ensues. The story also focuses on the couple's nanny who is forced to take their two young children with her to her son's wedding in Mexico because she can't find anyone else to watch them. There is also the story about the two young boys who fire the shot that injuries Blanchett's character. Then there is the seemingly unrelated story about a young Japanese deaf-mute. Giving away any specific details would ruin the experience.So often in numerous films today, the director never gives us enough to have a feeling about the characters. In a film that has more than a couple main characters, Alejandro González Iñárritu lets us into each character's own personal world and dilemma. You feel for the characters and that is why the film is so great. A film with this much complexity could have easily been rushed but Babel hits the spot because it tells a complete story and gives us enough closure to be satisfied.",Babel
293,misko14,Boring and empty,2,21 January 2007,"Today's movie audience is rather easily pleased considering the good reviews of Babel. It seems as anything that is a little bit different compared to the mainstream Hollywood movies, receives good rating just because it's different.Babel consists of three parallel and vague story lines each carried out in a different location of the world - Marocco, Japan and Mexico/US. The stories are related to each other although the connections between the story lines do not bring any real value to the movie (as it did in movies such as Pulp Fiction, Crash etc). The series of events that occur in Marocco are the only part where something of interest actually happens. The Japan and Mexico/US events are painfully boring and slow (on the border to being irritating).The biggest problem with Babel is that the movie suffers terribly of the slow pace and the non-existent plot. All events of any interest could be summarized in 15-20 minutes. The rest of the movie does not contain any substance. It's unbelievably empty (particularly the events that occur in Mexico).My second problem is that the movie is brutally depressing. This together with lack of story, makes the entire thing tiresome to watch.On the good side, the camera work and the actor performances were quite good, I guess.",Babel
294,ZebraGreg,"I'm glad I saw it. Four great, but loosely connected stories. Like Crash, but intercontinental.",9,11 November 2006,"This movie has four loosely connected stories, two in Morocco, one in Mexico and one in Japan, which are all intercut together. The Morocco story involves goat-herder boys shooting at a tourist bus, and the treatment for the woman who was shot. The Mexican story involves an elderly Nanny who goes to Mexico for her son's wedding, and troubles on her trip back. The Japanese story is about a deaf girl who feels rejected. I am glad I saw this movie this week since I am sure it is too artsy to play at the Movieplex very long. It is a good movie, but requires some dedication to appreciate. I liked each of the individual stories, and each have memorable performances and some great pictures. I liked visuals of the disco scene and the Mexican wedding festival. There were many actors, and many good performances. So is the is 3 star movie or a 4 star one I thought the movie was excellent, but I wish the whole story hung together a little better. I don't think it had the inter-racial tension aspect of Crash, but it had a one-world community aspect.",Babel
295,annie-186,Not for those wanting escapist entertainment...,3,8 February 2007,"Having heard many positive reviews, being impressed by the Golden Globe win and Oscar nominations, this was a film I HAD to see. However, I found it slow moving and far fetched. Basically there are four intertwining stories: 3 with a strong connection and one with a somewhat tenuous one. The Japanese sub-plot was an excellent story in its own right and did not need to be connected with the irritatingly implausible main plot.Things that irritated me about this film: 1. What shot, straight on at a vehicle's windscreen, somehow manages to curve right enter through a window and then hit someone in the chest and not in the fleshy part of their arm, which was in fact leaned up against said window. I think we have just found JFK's assassin... 2. Who in their right mind would leave the arrangements for the care of 2 children until the day before a major event such as a wedding? 3. The pace was just too slow. I left the cinema for approx 15 minutes and missed about 2 minutes of worthwhile story.On the plus side, the acting is fantastic, especially by the children, both Moroccan and American. They were very natural and fluid.In short, if this film wins the best picture Oscar, I will feel it is the greatest injustice since ""Titanic"" won in 1998.",Babel
296,Dark Raven,Inarritu does it again.,8,26 January 2007,"A career best from Brad Pitt in this multi layered drama spread over three continents. In fact all the cast give great performances from the children to the non actors - which says a lot about Inarritu as a director. As with his previous work this all feels incredibly real and gritty and there is barely a scene that didn't have something to say. Each story had its own interests and the cinematography was beautiful, keeping it feeling immediate and raw without the need for gratuitous zooms and re focus wracks in shot  an effect some directors are using today to try to create the ""documentary feel"". The music was also great and there is a great use of a track that was originally in the film ""The Insider"". I immediately recognised the track but in a weird way in suited this film more given the fact that the music has a very Middle Eastern feel to it.The only thing I'd say against the film is that the Japanese story felt superfluous to the rest of the movie. Not in terms of theme but in terms of a physical link that the other stories had. We are given one very weak and mild link but there is no direct one which weakens the overall connection of the story. Nevertheless it is well worth seeing.",Babel
297,mgoldhamer,Babel:a confusion of voices screaming for hope.,9,24 January 2007,"Babel is the latest in what I have dubbed the Ensemble Film Genre. Other films such as Magnalia and Crash also are similar in message and method. Take a large group of very well known and talented actors, put them into a vehicle with a very high velocity powered plot, introduce a common trait which binds all of the players through a single thread, and this is the glue which maintains the empathy throughout the picture. In Babel there are three separate but interwoven stories. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are an American married couple traveling via tour bus in Morocco discussing the current state of their strained relationship. Suddenly, an incident occurs which leads to world wide head lines and a major international incident. In the hills outside the city a goat herder has just purchased a rifle to kill the jackals who are ravaging his flock. He gives the gun to his two young sons and goes to work leaving his family and the boys to their daily chores. While tending the herd the boys try out the firearm and shoot at a bus. Half way across the world in California, a house- keeper answers the telephone. It is the husband of the American couple saying that they will be delayed and that the Mexican illegal immigrant child care-giver must keep his children in her care until they return, end of the phone call. Adriana Barraza's portrayal of the loyal and concerned care-giver of the two children, which takes them on an odyssey across the US border into Mexico and back again is the second of the three intermingled stories. A volleyball game in Tokyo begins the final setting with a 16 year old deaf girl at the center of the conflict. Rinko Kikuchi is the adolescent girl who lives with her father played by Koji Yakusho.The young girl is very troubled because of her family history. Her father was a big game hunter who gave the rifle to a guide in Morocco before it was sold to the goat herder. All of the three stories involve children and their families who misunderstand each other because of gaps in generations and secrets. There are many parallels in the story lines and many similar point of view shots by the different children and the adults. A theme that one cannot forgive the life that we spare for each other is prevalent. Judgement of the stranger has always been easier than listening for a common truth.",Babel
298,beattyg,an homogenized 'amores perros' - my review is a spoiler,6,26 December 2006,"Before I write about 'Babel' - I want to say the chaotic,surprising, pacy visual/story-telling journey of 'Amores Perros' remains within my cinematic experience. I loved it! The degrees of separation from one country/experience to another is not unusual film-making and can present itself as quite clunky when used as a device - Alejandro Gozalez Inarritus' is intelligent and a fine film-maker who has compromised as all do.Inspite of this being a cleverly constructed movie with exceptional cinematography I came away from this movie feeling everything had been slowed or dumbed down to join the dots, the scenery and characters were clichéd or situations unbelievable (not in any order) like......The deaf-dumb Japanese scenario was long-winded to establish the ex-hunting father gifted a gun to an Arab guide.The Arab children along with their father would have been blown away - no mercy.It is more likely the bus/passengers would have stayed, even though the passengers were presented as irritated and irritating.Would an illegal migrant cross the border to Mexico with a couple of American children in her care? After the loss of a baby to cot death which affected the whole family so deeply, would parents choose such a vacation so far away leaving their children with their nanny?Its unfair to go on...... I agreed with Cate when she said ""What are we doing here""! Whenever someone new and exciting breaks into the American film industry it deserves a loud applause from everywhere, but in saying this, it is obvious to those who watch and enjoy the cinema from all over; that Hollywood has the final word and often takes away what it was so attracted to.....a new way of looking at things through a foreign visual language.",Babel

Oh, I do get it actually, it's like if George W, Bush allowed a big American company to make and sell a rifle to a Japanese man and that made him invade a Moroccan family and that made them shoot that big American gun, nailing some very sensitive American woman who deserves only to be understood by her lousy overly-entitled Caucasian husband!

300,mysticwit,Poetry,9,12 October 2006,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's direction is brilliantly layered and intricately woven. He deftly uses different film stock, imagery, sound, and stories to weave a single tale out of four disparate ones, a talent he's shown in other films.The story by screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and Iñárritu has one incident ricochet around the globe, and peeling back the layers of culture to show the frustrating inability to communicate, and the poignancy and universality of familial love.Each story is complete, but a series of snapshots that leave as many questions as answers. As the stories unfold, the backstories and the futures of the characters are chock full of possibility and pain. As one commenter during the Q&A said, it was frustratingly beautiful. Each storyline deals with family and conflict from the inability to communicate or to understand.All the performances are incredible, and very touching. Brad Pitt did an excellent job, and the always outstanding Cate Blanchett, a powerhouse actor if there ever was one, has the least screen time of any of the leads. Few can do so much with so little. But the really outstanding performance is Rinko Kikuchi as a deaf-mute Tokyo teen.To say any more would possibly lesson the experience, so let me just say this: it may seem confusing at times, but by the end, it will seem like poetry.",Babel
301,Johnny0581,Great storytelling,9,5 November 2006,"Babel, in my opinion, most definitely deserves an Oscar nod, at least for directing. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The movie, in true Iñarritu fashion, does not have it's sequences in order but rather scrambled up like in Iñarritu's previous work, Amores Perros and 21 Grams. The movie takes place in three, or I should say four different parts of the world and three different continents. It starts off in a remote desert in Morocco, where we meet some preteen characters who are brothers, who bicker with one another like normal brothers. The younger one is always showing off to his older brother and between the horseplay and the show off he ends up doing something which will set off events in those three aforementioned continents. Also in Morocco, we meet an American couple, (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) whose relationship seems to be on the rocks and for unknown reasons are in that country, but the wife is anything but happy to be there and wishes to leave as soon as possible. In another part of the world, San Diego, California, we meet a Mexican nanny, (Adriana Barraza) who takes care of two American children like they were her own, later on, she is faced with the decision of attending her son's wedding across the border and leaving the children with someone else for the day, or staying and taking care of the kids whom she was trusted by their parents who are overseas at the time. She ultimately decides combine both and takes the 2 children across the border with her with the help of her nephew (Gael García Bernal). In yet another part of the world, Japan, we meet a deaf-mute girl (Rinko Kikuchi) who does not have a very good relationship with her father (Koyi Yakusho), and whose mother has passed away recently. She craves for attention but always feels like she is treated like freak when she is among normal people. As the movie develops, you will start to see the connection between these three totally different stories and the dots will start to connect. Irresponsibility and lack of communication are the main topics in this movie. There is a cameo by Crash's and WTC's Michael Peña as well as Clifton Collins Jr. The acting on this movie is superb, especially by Adriana Barraza and by Rinko Kikuchi, those two deserve an Oscar Nomination and deserve to win it too! There are very touching moments in this movie that will probably jerk a tear out of more than one moviegoer. Not for all tastes but if you're in the mood for a movie with good storytelling this is the one for you. 9 out of 10.",Babel
302,bmcdannell,From a 50+ perspective: Thumbs Down,1,17 August 2008,"Babel won tons of awards and tremendous critical acclaim. This tells us that coherent plotting and sensible storytelling are no longer requirements for cinematic accolades. Let's briefly outline some of the irredeemably absurd elements of the story: Morroccan authorities, without benefit of weapon, interviews or any other physical evidence whatsoever are able to track down the previous two owners of a rifle as well as the current owner - a desert goatherder - and locate his family. While they are doing this, with SUVs crawling all over the desert, neither they nor anyone else is able to get an ambulance, a helicopter or even so much as a golf cart to the person who has been wounded. A goatherder hands a high-powered rifle over to his two pre-teen sons with neither instruction nor apparent concern about their safety or anyone else's. Those sons - who are possessed of enough maturity and responsibility to tend the family's herds, give no thought to the possible consequences of using a moving tour bus for target practice. An illegal alien who has cared for two children since birth (a) waits until the day of her son's wedding to make plans to attend, and (b) decides to cross the border back into the U.S. with the two children she cherishes in the middle of both the night and the desert...with her drunken nephew at the wheel.That's just for starters. The entire movie was rife with this sort of inanity, which made it impossible for us to lend credence to anything the movie had to say. And while what it had to say was ostensibly something about our inability to communicate both interpersonally and across cultures, I'm afraid that we are in agreement that all that actually came out of this mess was an intense xenophobia and the conclusion that we are all - without fail or exception - cosmically stupid.We are used to suspending our disbelief for the sake of film, but we do expect that if we are asked to do this, the filmmaker provides the courtesy of a storyline and plot that will assist that effort. Babel, however, not only does not provide this, but gives us scenario after scenario that is so overwhelmingly implausible as to thwart one's best efforts to go along with it all.In the end, the only segment of the movie that possessed any heart or believability was the Japanese story line - and by the end of the movie we still only had about one-fifth of what may have been an interesting story there. Too bad. If they had given us that complete story it couldn't have been anywhere near as awful as what we wound up sitting through.",Babel
303,tankjonah,The Best film of the year! See it!,9,9 January 2007,"In Morocco a man purchases a rifle to help keep jackals away from his goats. One day, whilst he is in town to pick up supplies, his two young sons decide to test out the range of the rifle and begin firing toward a tourist bus. Aboard the bus an American tourist (Cate Blanchett) is hit and her husband (Brad Pitt) tries frantically to get her help as they are miles from a hospital or help. Just prior to this, via phone, he had insisted that his housekeeper, an illegal Mexican, (Adriana Barraza) miss her son's wedding to look after his children. She instead crosses the border into Mexico and takes them to the wedding. Meanwhile in Japan, a deaf mute girl (Rinko Kikuchi) increasingly depressed about the suicide of her mother and her inability to find a boyfriend, fears for her father (Kôji Yakusho) when police arrive to question him.An outstanding film. Too often with films of this type (multi-layered interlocking stories) the stories are not all of sufficient quality and interest and therefore the film as a whole suffers. Not so the case here. Each story is powerful, unpredictable, surprising and moving. The acting is excellent but it is the quality of the script and direction which really elevate the film. Iñárritu maintains tension by cleverly cutting between scenes at key moments. Rather than irritate, this adds suspense as the next key moment of the next story is then revealed whilst we wait to learn about the scene we have just left.The film explores such themes as dislocation from family; early on Blanchett asks Pitt ""why are we here?""; their kids are back at home and she clearly isn't enjoying their tour, Barraza herself is dislocated from her son whose wedding she is almost forced to miss and finally Kikuchi has been distant from her father since her mother's suicide. The link used to interlock the Japan story with the rest of the events is well done and recalls Winchester '73 (1950) where a weapon changing hands drives the narrative. The film also makes minor but telling comments on American political hypocrisy and disinformation - the US government had immediately and without any evidence claimed that Blanchett's shooting was the result of a terrorist - sheer nonsense and sheer lies. It's this and other minor moments - Pitt exploding (understandably stressed as Blanchett lies dying and awaiting medical help) about 'this piece of s%$t country'- that had me thinking (in terms of their current political climate) F*&^ing America! Quick to belittle and misrepresent others. This is a great film with irony; ultimately the only family/people who come away okay from the series of events are the Americans, although it could be argued that the Japanese father and daughter are brought closer together by the events. Certainly the best film of the year and the best film since Mystic River (2003).",Babel

I myself thought the cinematography was brilliantly executed, and Cate Blanchett sexy in the extreme even when dying of a bullet wound! Although the ""erotic"" pseudo lovemaking kissing while she is peeing in a pot, while DYING was STUPID AND MIND INSULTINGAs a parent, albeit divorced and physically geographically near my teen, I was OUTRAGED AND INFURIATED.

307,epcot26-1,Failed to see the point,6,16 February 2016,"Babel was good in trying to connect four different lives together by one tragedy, but I think the director failed at giving or portraying the point of all of the interconnected chain of events, and how they lead from one to the other.It just did not see the point of the film.What message was the director trying to make with the main characters? It didn't make sense.The acting performances were all good, but at some point, it felt like they were even confused as to what they are supposed to be doing in the film.Not that great of a film overall.",Babel
308,ronnay_barkay,Forgettable,4,29 December 2009,"I watched this movie a few days ago, it happened to be on TV. I decided to watch it as it had won an Oscar. Well what I got was a tedious, melodramatic piece of film making that was not too good at all.First of all there's 2 boys, one of which shoots a bus. The bullet hits a woman and she nearly dies. At the same time her kids are being minded by a Mexican illegal immigrant who decides to take the 2 children to her son's wedding in Mexico.Meanwhile in a pretty much unrelated story, a deaf Japanese girl is having difficulties in her relationship with her father and is generally unhappy and sexually frustrated. After taking some alcohol and drugs with her friends, she goes out to a night club but leaves when the boy she likes kisses her friend. When she goes home a police officer calls in relation to the gun that her father used to own. She takes things a little too far with this guy and it gets a little embarrassing for them both.In conclusion, this film feels like it was written as it was filmed. There was no point in making this, no imagination and no inspiration. It was like Pulp Fiction crossed with Lost in Translation only far worse than either (and I didn't care much for Lost In Translation).Avoid",Babel

The trick of having several stories told in a parallel, but nonlinear, fashion, which all begin to converge at some point in unexpected and synergistic ways is no less intriguing than it was in films such as 21 Grams and Traffic. But, for me, it was beginning to feel almost formulaic this time around. Enjoyable and thought provoking, nonetheless with great performances.

310,cncsurf,Someone Forgot to Sort the Recycle Bin,1,4 September 2016,"When attempting to make a movie with threads that interweave they have to come together and make sense eventually. This film took all the cheap tricks from other bad movies, like Crash, and just let things fall in a disjointed and uninteresting mess. Much of the time line and plots must be ignored to even attempt making sense of what is happening as the director does a poor job of connecting the plots.Here's the spoilers. Which won't spoil anything because nothing makes sense anyway.All couples have problems and this one has a miscarriage so they go to Morocco to be alone together....on a group tour, and leave their two living children with their nanny. Then we jump to the Mexican Nanny, the couple leaves to watch their children, being told she has to watch them when she planned on going to her son's wedding in Mexico. At the end it is revealed this phone call is made AFTER it is known, worldwide mind you (news reports in a Tokyo bar reporting on the ""terrorist attack"") the American woman was shot. There is no sympathy from the Mexican nanny and apparently the nanny knows no family members or friends of the family even after raising the kids for 7 years or so. There are no grandparents to the children, no aunts, or no uncles who can watch the kids when they would surely know their mother has been shot. So we are to believe the nanny will just load up the kids KNOWING she is illegally in the country and head down to Mexico. Leave this plot twist hanging for a moment....Swap over to some Moroccan family run by a man who buys a high powered hunting rifle for his 8 and 10 year old sons and without any instruction or practice, leave them to tend hundreds of goats with said rifle. ""Hmm what could we shoot with our new gun, Ahmed? Cans? Rocks? Jackals, Our goats? I know Ahmed, lets shoot at a tour bus to test the bullets."" Poor American woman is shot by hapless Ahmed and sent to the only Moroccan village with no vehicles even though Moroccan police are at the scene of the crime and miraculously find a toothless hunting guide that lives in the desert. Leave this plot twist hanging for a few...Bounce over to Tokyo where Japanese news outlets report that an American was shot...in Morocco....and this warrants breaking news with her portrait, on TV in a Tokyo bar. To gain the pedophile demographic some gratuitous nudity from an angsty inebriated mini-skirt clad high school student is thrown in. Oh, she's deaf, in an attempt to garner sympathy for an unsympathetic character and impress movie critics for the groundbreaking feat of casting a deaf person. Leave this hanging for a while...It turns out the Deaf Japanese girl's millionaire father (lives on the top floor penthouse in Tokyo) is an avid hunter and decides the best hunting trip he could take would be with a toothless goat herder in the middle of the Moroccan desert which has no electricity, no vehicles, no running water, no beds, and I doubt speaks fluent Japanese. As a gift he leaves his high powered hunting rifle and 300 rounds of ammo for the toothless goat herding hunting guide. This is the gun used by the stupid 8 year old Ahmed when he shoots at a tour bus and hits the poor American tourist.While languishing in a Moroccan desert the whole world is told about this shooting. But apparently the nanny is unconcerned at the festivities in Mexico with the children. Even though the whole world knows the mother of those children has been shot, apparently no one from the State Department, FBI, family members, church friends, coworkers, local SDPD, or news media stopped in to talk to the children or nanny. NOPE. ""Off to Tijuana for a wedding...while I'm illegally in the USA. With my employer's gringo children."" After nanny gets a little sumn' sumn' it's back in to the car with her illegal status, with her drunk nephew driving, to cross the border... with two gringo children that aren't hers...at 3am...with nephew's handgun somewhere in the car... I was expecting Larry the Cable guy to be the border patrol agent, which would have warranted another star but it was some angry black officer who rummages through their belonging the way no law enforcement agent EVER would have done. Skip forward a few minutes and the nanny and kids find themselves dumped in the middle of the desert while the nephew evades police and we never hear from him again. The nanny and kids are rescued by another angry BP agent and the nanny is deported. She should have been deported for shear stupidity BUT turns out she was illegally in the nation, employed illegally by the American tourists stuck in a Moroccan hospital. Oh yeah, there's a naked Japanese teenager for some reason.So the lesson would be? Don't go to Mexican weddings? Don't give high powered rifles to children? Don't be an idiot nanny. Don't get shot in Morocco? Don't be a Japanese teenager? Something about race and culture is good and bad? ""Guns are bad"" wafts in the air like a bad fart loosely tying this whole stinking mess together. I know I left a lot hanging, nothing makes sense, and my review is an unorganized mess. But that's just how the movie rolls.",Babel
311,restin_him,Another cheap attempt at insight,2,23 December 2008,"Babel is a film dedicated to communicating to us the importance of communication and how in todays world it can fail us. This film however does not follow in the foot steps of the tower of Babel but in the actual babbling of children.The film develops four separate story lines that are easily connected even though there is a possible attempt to make us wonder at the connection.We meet a married couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) traveling together through Morocco in an attempt to reconnect but failing at every turn. A young Shepard boy and his brother in Morocco who accidentally shoot at the bus the young couple is traveling in seriously injuring the wife. The couples Mexican nanny (Adriana Barraza) who takes the couples two children with her to Mexico for her sons wedding when the couple can not return do to the shooting. Finally we meet Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a deaf-mute Japanese school girl struggling with the suicide of her mom and a Dad she doesn't communicate well with.This film suffers from the same thing that Crash did, so much going on and poorly done story telling. No character gets enough story time to make us actually care about them and in most cases they become annoying or give us no reason to sympathize with them. The characters are well acted but written as two dimensional figures portraying simple images. While each actor is very good they are never given enough screen time to take their character from the simple figure to a deep person.The so called connections between each story is also supposed to be discovered by us slowly as the film goes on with Chieko's role being the final reveal. The problem is within the first 15 minutes or so we know exactly how the couple, Shepard boy, and nanny fit together and in the next ten can simply deduce Chieko's role. It is a juvenile line played out quickly and ends the movie before we have a chance to care (not that we have anything to care about).It is also like Crash in that in its attempt to get its point across it hits us in the head with extremes instead of making us look at the true issues we each face. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga wish for us to see different ways in which we fail at communication not just with language and strangers but in emotion with those close to us. The problem is we don't really care about these people and can see clearly where they fail. We face extremes and can walk away saying that I am glad I am not like that. The film makers could have served their goal better by clearly focusing on the family and how they may communicate well with others outside the family but can not convey simple things to those they are closest to. True it isn't as dramatic as they may want or as artsy but would have been a lot better then the confused and shallow story they gave us.I also have to mention the use of disgusting and useless sexual content in this film, which is done exclusively by the underage characters. One of the Shepard boys spies on his older sister while she changes and then we are treated to a scene of him masturbating while thinking about it. Chieko struggles with sexuality which is normal for teens in her situation, but to drive the point home we get to see her flash her bare crotch to older boys, forces her dentist to grab her crotch during an exam, strips completely naked for a total strange and forces him to touch her breasts. The portion with the Shepard boy is useless and adds nothing to the story, but if it did it could have been handled in a more mature way. As for Chieko, while her actions are born from her pain the director preferred to treat us like idiots and show us everything instead of being creative with how they revealed these problems.In all this film was not creative or insightful. In truth it is an exercise in cheap film making in an attempt to appear deep and forward thinking. There are better more intelligent ways to communicate everything this film desires to tell us but few in Hollywood are smart enough to do it.",Babel

This was an endless catalog of human suffering. I think that the only things that weren't in the movie were sexual assault and ethnic cleansing. As the characters suffer, so must the audience. At least the characters in the movie weren't beaten over the head with the seriousness of the film-maker's intentions.

If you like what he's done in the past, I think you will enjoy this too. For me, this was a completely different movie experience than anything I've seen before. I am currently living in South Korea, and completely forgot that the movie is in 4 languages until the movie began. So I had to watch 3/4 of the film without understanding what was being said. While it lead me to general confusion regarding the Japanese storyline (I have since read the boards here and wow, I was totally lost with regards to that plot line), it gave me an interesting insight to the film. Not knowing what was being said allowed me to view the film from a physically emotional perspective. I had to gage the emotional display of the actors in order to ascertain what was happening much of the time. And while I was not able to understand the troubled past of the Japanese girl, her acting truly displayed the emotional turmoil she was experiencing. It was almost like watching a silent film with no dialog cards. Truly phenomenal film.",Babel

315,vampirock_x,how did our world end up like this?,10,23 March 2007,"This film held my expectation even since last year in Cannes and the very idea of various problems of individuals in a global connection background simply impressed me.People like to compare it to ""Crash"" as both films are multi-plot, but...C'mon guys, this is not the only two films telling more than one story, and it's so unreasonable for me since the two of them are so different in all other aspects. Let's just take it easy not to make unnecessary connection.It is a work of special directing, great acting, intelligent editing, superb cinematography and lifelike music.While the Morroco part was shot in a rather intense and unsteady form like a documentary and the America part was no more than a family drama, the Japan part was more artistic and full of meaningful stills and close-ups.Cate and Gael were both good, but Adriana Barraza's and Rinko Kikuchi's parts were so outshining. As all the actors' performances were so incredibly accurate and vivid, Iñárritu's frequent adoption of close-ups really achieved great effects.Gustavo's score is indescribably beautiful. It's not much, but every time appearing at the right place and the right time. He's been playing the chords of my heart even since the first time I saw ""21 Grams"".Some friends argued in the message boards that the story is not reasonable enough and it's a drawback. I'd rather say this is what the director and writers want us to see --- the baffling action and reaction of individuals under modern pressures, unnecessary precautions and between mental and cultural barriers. Yes, there must be a reason for every happening, and for this one, it's individual. I think you must be a deaf-mute, lack-of-love, defensive, Japanese girl to really understand why she lied to the policeman about her mother's death and more...It's just not the point.Undoubtedly this is a disturbing and exhausting film, and I don't even think the heart-warming hand-in-hand ending scene was enough to cover my upset and disappointment. And this is it, the world we live in. It's just that the writers link many unpleasant realities together and dramatized them --- I'm pretty sure many real happenings are even more dramatized than this story.It's rather vigilantly interesting to see the circle in which humans pile up difficulties for themselves and solve them and then pile up more...Will there be one day we cannot deal with them anymore? Will it be terrorists, robots or environment? It's amazing how we went so far; it's even more how we end up like this.",Babel
316,nadeeshantennage,Simply astounding on so many levels..,8,3 April 2018,"'Babel' is an authentic portrayal of the depletion of humanity and the terrible negligence of basic human values.
The narrative of the movie moves along a spectrum of extreme emotional depth and execution of the the underlying morals in a deeply disturbing turn of events.
The plot follows an accident faced by an American tourist which leads upto the unfolding of 3 different narratives which depicts 3 diffrent scenarios surrounding 3 different communities.
Director Alejandro González Iñárritu masterfully manages to create the link between the 3 different scenarios by layering the thread of linking the narratives by giving the audiences to view the plot from 3 different scopes each which leads up to the scenarios depicted under each sub plot.
The most amazing aspect of this is that the director has managed to layer the sub plots with abundant suspense all throughout the movie and rigorously emotional acting performances.
Rinko Kikuchi who plays a young deaf Japanese girl creates maximum impact by coating the performance with enough emotional intensity and a marvelously convincing performance.
Her pain of being treated differently is reflected through her glowing eyes in almost every scene she's in.
Adriana Barraza's performance is no different and would make you reevaluate the core values a human should possess.
The only negative aspect about the film that I witnessed are its confusing timelines surrounding the sub plots and the link between them leading up to the disturbing key event.
The film would wreck you emotionally and disturb you to your heart's core which is exactly why you must see this film.",Babel
317,mikek-6,Very disappointing,5,6 December 2006,"I was really looking forward to 'Babel' as I've liked Inarritu's previous films, particularly '21 grams' which I think is one of the best films of all time. Perhaps I was hoping for too much because, in the fullness of time, '21 grams' will probably be seen as Inarritu's zenith. It has one of the most sophisticated structures of any film ever made and is almost unfaultable on any level. For some reason 'Babel' seems a little forced to me and the script doesn't have the sharpness of his previous films. There are long music sequences which I found boring and pointless and I'm not sure that Inarritu and the writer, Arriaga, had as much passion for the subject as '21 grams'. It just comes across as a little forced and lifeless. Almost as though they had to make the film rather than wanted to from their soul. That's not to say its all bad. The performances are great and very real as you'd expect. The camera-work is top notch and the editing solid, although they haven't been as ballsy as in '21 grams'. Of course the director didn't just want to re-make '21 grams', I can see that, and its not what I'm saying but, simply taking the film as it hit me, didn't move me or grab me like his previous films. Perhaps I was expecting too much. Still, I've got my copy of '21 grams' on DVD which I look at at regular intervals. It's unlikely that I'll ever see a better film than that.",Babel
318,LLinus,"Love, lust and curiosity",8,8 August 2013,"A work of art, as we get to familiar ourselves from four different perspectives, with the people from four different cultures, the director has unique ways to approach the audience by capturing different kinds of emotions in to picture. What i can only presume is a difficult task, other than directing, Alejandro involved more than one language in this movie, putting even more weight on his shoulder, but he managed to make it all work, which is absolutely fascinating. He as well managed to create a particular intense, heavy-panic, interaction with the actors which we rarely get to see, its very similar to a real life situation, which makes it slightly shocking. The soundtrack in this movie was for the most part acoustic, yet it manage to capture my full attention even further as the emotional scenes or the express of happiness came in to show, i think the composer had a big influence in this movie when it comes to create this dramatic atmosphere, it was all very charming. Since we experience different point of views throughout the movie, its important that it's well edited, i thought that the time among each point of view was just good enough to still keep the suspense going throughout the whole movie.",Babel
319,barhound78,If only Inárittu had kept his own message simple!,7,23 January 2007,"A grieving American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are holidaying in Morocco when their coach is hit by a stray bullet fired from a rifle belonging to the teenage son (Boubker Ait El Caid) of a local farmer. Meanwhile an immigrant nanny (Adriana Barraza) makes a return to Mexico for her sons wedding with her two young charges illegally in tow. And in Japan, a disturbed deaf-mute adolescent girl (Rinko Kikuchi) trawls the streets and clubs of Tokyo awkwardly seeking a fervent sexual awakening. Alejandro González Inárritu's Oscar contender Babel is a strange work. A multi-stranded contemplation on language barriers and cultural prejudices set audaciously across three continents. Four far-reaching tales spun (somewhat haphazardly) around a single gunshot. Mechanics-wise, Babel is almost flawless; a better edited film has not been seen all year and the photography is stunning. From the unforgiving plains of Morocco through the tawdry, tequila fuelled wedding party in Guadalupe to the neon emblazoned city-scape of Tokyo, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto captures both mankind and nature at its most beautiful and its most desolate. Similarly, the use of sound is almost as pristine. On top of this, the acting is exemplary from a wide ranging ensemble cast. Pitt, in the grips of despair, displays a gravitas that has only been hinted at in the past. El Caid shows a maturity way beyond his years. Barraza cuts a tragic figure as the nanny whose conflicted maternal instincts (and a bitingly loco Gael Garcia Bernal) drive her towards her fate. As the isolated teen grasping for male attention through increasingly self-degrading acts of exposure, Kikuchi is nothing short of a revelation. So where does it all go wrong? Lacking the startling vibrancy of Amores Perros and the gut-wrenching emotional body-blows of 21 Grams, Babel is modern cinema of biblical pretensions rendered partially impotent by an infuriatingly detached script that piles contrivance upon ludicrous contrivance until it buckles under its own self-important weight. As the stories continue to run parallel, the tenuous point of contact between the stories lends a jarringly absurd tone to the weighty proceedings. An unnecessary and slightly burdensome link. Inárittu's determination to illicit a dramatic kick in the last third also backfires. Irrationality and melodrama threaten to overwhelm as the director attempts to slot his pieces into place for their final revelations. The previously restrained, character motivated film lurches in an unwelcome tangent as if all before it were a charade. A sense of desperation enters proceedings and, although somewhat rescued by the touching closing scene, the damage is unfortunately done. What is left is a jigsaw that doesn't quite fit. Or rather three jigsaws that simply do not go together. Each strand engages on their own specific terms yet the cohesion between them is simply lacking and feels forced and ultimately diminishes from the whole. Which is a shame as Babel clearly had a lot to say both on international barriers/relations and upon our isolation and lack of understanding in a World of technology and, ironically, communication. If only Inárittu had just kept his own message simple!",Babel

I'm a fan of his work, and loved 21 Grams, but this has to be one of the most disappointing pieces in a long time. 2 1/2 hours of my life I want back. This is supposed to be a film about communication. It really isn't. The Brad Pitt/Cate Blanchet storyline delves nowhere into themes of communication. They are even able to freely communicate with the villagers where they are stranded. The deaf-mute Japanese girl storyline is way too obvious. And kinda kinky. But in the end, in a really sad angsty emo kinda way. Made me throw up in my mouth a little. The Morroccan family with the rifle storyline? it kinda went nowhere fast, and forces you to watch a pre-pubescent boy masturbate to thoughts of his little sister naked. It added absolutely nothing to the film. Maybe an homage to Bertolucci? lmao The Mexican nanny storyline definitely had the best acting. And the most tension. However, the plot is ludicrous, and what is an attempt of commentary on the illegal alien situation in America falls flat, due irrational behaviour on part of the characters. Their decisions are their dooms. There is no miscommunication here. Thus no theme of communication. And if, as Innaritu claims, this is a film about communication, then wtf? We have no film.

""A sucker is born every minute"" is what Hollywood must have been thinking when they decided to distribute this film. If you have seen the previews and read a couple of reviews, then seeing the movie may not add much to your experience of the story-line.And while the scenarios themselves are quite compelling, the characters are taking risks that get them into the predicaments that bring them great anguish.

But finally I gave into the curiousness and watched Babel. And I have to say that it was really as bad as I was told.The actors were good, for the most part. Unfortunately that can't be said for the script. Some movies have a habit of throwing bits and pieces at the audience and expect them to make up their own story. That can be good, if it is done well. Of course my point is that in Babel it is not done well at all. Some characters desperately needed at least some back story, so we actually would give a sith about them.On the other hand the writer had no problem shoving horribly constructed failures of communication unto our laps. I wouldn't have minded to think a bit more on my own there or see a more subtle approach at an otherwise interesting subject. And it wasn't really necessary to stretch the quite thin story way over two hours. 30 to 45 minutes would have been quite enough for this basic idea.To sum it up, I would say that the writer made some poor choices at where the audience should think for themselves and where not. As did the director when he decided to drag out a story that would easily fit on a coaster over 143 minutes.Watch this only when you have a remote control at hand to skip or fast forward.",Babel
323,Aaron_West,Iñárritu's international conclusion to his thematic 'Death Trilogy',9,26 May 2014,"An international journey of consequence, circumstance, and redemption; fraternity, hope and family.Alejandro G. Iñárritu's closure to his thematical 'Death Trilogy' is a wonderfully eloquent, sophisticated and poised vision of the interconnectedness of humanity and the unforetold consequences of action or inaction. Iñárritu utilises a mirage of visual, audio and narrative techniques, editing such together to create a wholly powerful and surprisingly coherent experience. The acting is unanimously brilliant, a highlight being the performances from big names such as Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, as well as Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi. Technically, the film is rather interesting, it was shot entirely on hand-held cameras in order of magnify the sense of loss and dread in the film, but this does result in an ugly film, rather the opposite in fact, Babel is a remarkably aesthetic film which also doesn't compromise its beauty for its darkness and vise-versa - the scene where Adriana Barraza is trudging through the desert in her bright red dress remains an iconic image in my mind. I am a great admirer of hyperlink film, films which feature multiple distinct story lines in an effort to thematically demonstrate through allegory or simply as a narrative heightener of tension and emotion, and Babel is one of the most refined I have seen; sometimes you get a great epic like Magnolia or Cloud Atlas or a powerful intimate like Three Colours Red and sometimes you get a largely incoherent exercise in thematics like 21 Grams or The Fountain or simply rather basic and gratuitous films like Crash or Snatch; I believe Babel belongs in the former rather than the later. I also respect Babel's way of presenting itself, it doesn't patronise the audience with gratuitous darkness and horror but instead walks a wonderful line between cynicism and humanism - it is a remarkably refreshing pathos and complex realism that isn't present in most cinema. To find the root of the films meaning you must simply look at its title, Babel, showing how like in the biblical story of 'The Tower of Babel' the barriers of culture and language stop humans from achieving greatness and true coherence; but the film also evaluates the story and shows that despite these superficial barriers everyone makes mistakes and people can still be good and act as ""the brightest light in the darkest night"".The biblical story of Babel goes: after Noah and his ark stopped atop some plane, his family repopulated the earth, therefore everyone spoke the same language. Once there was enough people, they decided to reach for heaven by building a huge tower, The Tower of Babel. God was obviously annoyed and so set the languages of the world on random, so only small groups shared the same language. Now that no one could communicate, they stopped building the tower eventually fell. The people scattered across the land and that is why different languages exist. Now, ignoring obvious questions raised by the story and taking it purely allegorically, The Story of Babel teaches us that with communication between the people of the earth, anything is possible. But more importantly, without communication chaos and disorganisation occurs. That is the basic idea of the film Babel, with a crisis and a difference of language problems escalate and chaos ensues.",Babel

And the prejudice against Mexicans??? They just want live their lives.Well, i'm not so good on English, but i tried.

I cared about all the characters and couldn't wait for the next piece of each of their stories. The exploration of other aspects of human interaction besides racism plus the fact that we are being shown that people are really the same the world over is what puts Babel a cut above.A Mexican nanny trying to choose between her devotion to duty and one of the most important days in her family history. How many times have we been put into a situation where we try to do the right thing, but it turns out wrong? If we'd only had more time to make that decision....Two Moroccan brothers who accidentally seriously injure someone. Didn't we all do some dumb stuff when we were kids? How lucky were we that things didn't go terribly wrong? An American couple away from home. The wife is injured in what seems to be a terrorist attack. How would we feel? What would we do? A deaf Japanese teenager, with other life issues, trying to find her place in society. What a compelling story. What if we couldn't hear? How would our lives in high school have been different? This is one of the best films I've seen in the past several years. It's great storytelling with a very human point of view. I felt the pain of all the characters as they tried their best to deal with difficult circumstances.

Pitt and Blanchett, the main reason most would turn to this, are really bit players in the overall tableau and add nothing by their presence other than their name draw. Minimal English (maybe a quarter of the dialogue) with many subtitles during Spanish, Arabic and Japanese scenes. Much of the film is random shots that the Director uses to fill time to try and make up for a very flimsy and poorly developed simplistic plot.Blanchett, playing an American tourist, is shot early in the movie while riding in a tour bus in Morocco. A widowed Japanese businessman has an oversexed virgin deaf-mute daughter with some serious psychological problems. A Moroccan father gives his two young sons a rifle to try and keep jackals away from the goats. A Hispanic nanny takes two American children to a relative's wedding in Mexico. All are connected and the movie eventually shows you how - though the writing has given it all away early on leaving little to do but wait and wait and wait until the film finally ends the misery - if you can keep from nodding off.",Babel
329,cinna665,Helsinki International Film Festival: Babel,9,15 September 2006,"A new director's cut of Alejandro Gonzales Iñarritu's Babel was shown last night in the opening of Helsinki International Film Festival. This cut was said to be slightly different from the award-winning version last spring in Cannes.Babel is a story of three stories about communication difficulties, and how a person can be alone also in a huge city as well as inside a family, because people have not found means to communicate properly with each other. In the first chapter an American couple is visiting in Morocco when the wife (Cate Blanchett) gets shot in the middle of the desert and her husband (Brad Pitt) is desperately trying to get help in time. Second chapter is about a Mexican lady who is taking care of two kids in California, and ends up taking the kids along with her to Mexico in order to be able to attend her son's wedding. Third chapter is about a Japanese deaf-mute girl who feels extremely alone after her mother's death and because of her problem. And as in Iñarritu's previous films, also Babel ties all these stories together in the end.Babel is full of powerful emotions and drama. Pitt as the desperate husband in the Moroccoan desert does incredibly touching job when trying to help his wife. This must be one of Pitt's best roles ever. In Morocco Iñarritu is using mainly local amateur actors as the villagers and other people, and they bring beautiful authenticity to the film among the beautifully simple desert scenery.Huge, crowded and noisy Tokyo is a total opposite to the Moroccoan desert. Being alone in a city like that feels unrealistic, but Rinko Kikuchi as deaf-mute Chieko makes that possible. Her role is extremely powerful as a girl who has just lost her mother, is not very close to her father and is unable to make physical connection to other people.Babel is a beautifully made movie, even though it bit of lacks the soul of the two previous films of Iñarritu -trilogy. Sometimes it feels as is the original idea of communication difficulties is somehow hidden under other kind of drama, and I kind of missed some of the details of the original idea. After Amores Perros and 21 Grams my expectations were probably a bit too high for Babel.Babel is one of those dramas that make you feel strong emotions and make you think. I recommend Babel to all people who enjoy films that speak to you and make you feel. But this is not a mainstream movie to everyone's liking.",Babel
330,shuichi_shindosan,A magnificent effort which makes Hollywood genius,9,27 January 2007,"This film from start to finish is a ride which takes you on almost every emotion possible. There is nothing in this movie which doesn't make you think for more than two seconds. As every second passes a new thought comes into your brain and complicates things for you just so you can enjoy the movie. The movie talks to you in a way which emotionally takes you through the movie. While watching if you don't cry at least twice then the movie just isn't for you. The movie is an outstanding piece of work by a most marvellous director, Alejandro Gonzalez, who has directed amazing movies such as Ammores Perros and 21 Grams, both brilliant movies. This movie is his jump from small film to big blockbuster genius. This is a movie which is original and has style to it, it is a movie that Hollywood can be proud of for years to come, it's not a remake and it's proud of it! Brad Pitt's performance is amazing and simply marvellous. From start to finish when he is with his wife (cate blanchett) you just feel his emotion and just sit and watch him, I could have for hours.Gael Garcia Bernal also did a brilliant performance as we see him go from San Diego to Mexico and his reactions from the two different lifestyles. His performance was just as amazing as Brad's.Rinko Kikuchi is the woman that deserves an Oscar. Her performance as the death girl was simply beautiful. Her skill and brutality brought the screen in lights as the beautiful young rebel teen. She simply was the best part of the movie and clearly the most deserving of the Oscar, she held the movie and she made you think all the way through it.Overall a really excellent movie that has only thrills in store for you, please watch the movie and rate it as fantastic, there's nothing else that needs to be said about a most magnificent movie that tells a story of love and survival and many other things.",Babel

In fact there are some pretty offensive racial stereotypes employed throughout this film to progress the ""story-line"", such as it is:Bedouin goat-herders being portrayed as so ignorant and insensible that they will shoot at a bus for no good reason, and that one masturbates while thinking of his sister undressing. (what point was that scene trying to make exactly?)Middle-aged white tourists, who are obviously open-minded enough to be there in the first place suddenly becoming totally unreasonable and racist, believing the locals are all ""out-to-get them"" despite only one shot ever having been fired.That Morocco is so backward it would take more than a day to get access to better than veterinarian care.That the local US embassy staff would be stupid enough to classify a single shot as a terrorist event, even though it is this classification that apparently led to the delay in the ambulance.That a deaf-mute Japanese girl would be so desperate for ""affection"" that she would lick the face of her dentist and strip in front of a policeman she had only just met.That a Mexican nanny would be stupid enough to take the children in her care out of the country and try to return with a drunk at the wheel, despite being herself an illegal.etc etcFor a film with so many plaudits about it's ""depth"" and ""insight"" I find these hard to countenance.The 3 stories are essentially totally unconnected, with the writer forced to link them with some ridiculously unlikely happenstance. The art direction is average, with the shooting style making the film even more exhausting an ordeal than it already is.The acting was superb however, so full credit to the great cast. The score is also strong. These two facts alone are, I believe the reason most people seem to view this as art (which it isn't) rather than a poorly pulled-together set of unrelated and individually weak yarns.",Babel
333,terryhall2,Pointless examination of four cultures with nothing in common except their awfulness,1,23 November 2006,"An exercise in self-indulgence, this film will give those who think multi-culturalism is NOT a good thing confirmation of such. Each culture should just stay in their own place and not bring their customs down onto another society- that appears to be the message in this long drawn out, pointless and rather sobering film.A film in which every participant made the wrong choices, and suffered consequently; a film in which there was an absurd link between the father of a Japanese girl with a huge psychological problem and two young Moroccan boys who used the rifle their father had been given by the Japanese man when he was on a hunting expedition and shot the wife of an American couple on a tour bus. This same couple had thoughtlessly (selfishly?) left their young children with a Mexican lady while they took their trip to Morocco and expected the lady not to go to her own son's wedding. She goes anyway and takes the children who are then witness to traditions which, in this film, showed up as third-world shenanigans passing for culture in that country. Why Brad Pitt's family went through such trauma is unaccountable, but things happen when the wrong energy is sent out. Why Brad Pitt became involved with this dire film at all is also a mystery, unless it was packaged to him in a different way, owed someone a favour or got paid lots of money. Humanity at its worst.

Or not, in this case",5,14 April 2008,"This is in many ways a beautifully photographed and acted film, but fails in its quest to achieve any kind of meaning or significance.The film attempts to show that we are all intimately connected and our lives interwoven no matter where we live on the planet. Unfortunately, pretty much all the events in the film are driven forward, not by the influence of distant events but by seemingly random by individuals in the film. Characters who have shown that they are reliable and are in positions of trust suddenly start behaving in stupid and dangerous ways for no apparent reason.Worse, the supposed interconnections between the stories are often slight and imbued with happenstance rather than any sense of tragedy or inevitability. One segment--the Japanese story--is so detached as to be pretty much superfluous and could easily be deleted from the movie.I can sort of see what the makers wanted this to be, but unfortunately they never got beyond the stage of good intentions.",Babel
335,Author_Poet_Aberjhani,Love and Communication in Babel's Global Village,10,20 January 2008,"From its outset, just the title of ""Babel"" makes it clear that the fatally flawed quality of communication in the modern world ranks high among the primary concerns of the film's director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, and writer Guillermo Arriaga. Despite the fact that we live in a world where we enjoy boasting about daily advances in technology, ""Babel"" illustrates superbly--via three intertwining stories set in four different countries--that when it comes to the simpler art of hearing, respecting, and exercising compassion for each other, human beings seem dedicated to moving backwards.The movie takes a close painful look at the barriers we maintain between ourselves; and, it identifies some of the consequences of refusing to sidestep such barriers long enough to see each other as human beings rather than as racial, cultural, or political categories. The international ensemble comprising the cast of Babel is never anything less than flawless. Adrianna Barraza shines pure genius in her performance as a Mexican immigrant whose devotion to her own family and that of her California employers leads to a nightmare of degradation and disillusionment.Brad Pitt as Richard Jones, Cate Blanchett as his wife Susan Jones, and Gael Garcia Bernal as Santiago have garnered suitable acclaim for their respective roles as products of one culture who find their fates suddenly imperiled by the parameters of another. At times language is the obvious barrier in question but more often than language is attitude in the form of verbal and physical hostility.Rinko Kikuchi as the troubled deaf mute Japanese adolescent Chieko is as dazzling as she is mesmerizing. Following her mother's suicide, the character of Chieko is condemned to alienation more from within than without. In a world where effective communication is already compromised by preoccupations with prejudice and hidden self-serving agendas, Chieko's attempt at connecting with others is further impeded by her inability to hear or speak vocally. Her situation turns into a profoundly precarious one when the need to reconnect with a sense of life manifests as clumsy heartbreaking attempts at erotic interaction. Chieko is a particularly significant character in ""Babel"" because it is through Rinko Kikuchi's portrayal of her with raw emotional power and symbolic physical nudity that we experience most fully the film's second major theme: the fate of children in the global village. Common to each of the three connected stories in ""Babel,"" no matter the language spoken or the beliefs entertained, are children thrown into devastating states of crisis and trauma resulting from values and priorities established by adults.The genuine beginning of ""Babel"" might appear to be when the barely adolescent boy Yussef, played by Boubker Ait El Caid, accidentally and ignorantly shoots the American tourist Susan while testing the gun's range. The film's real beginning, however, does not take place in front of the movie camera at all. It occurs when a Japanese tourist and hunter presents a gun to his Moroccan guide as a token of gratitude for services rendered. What, in the end, makes ""Babel"" an overwhelming masterpiece of tragic beauty is how this simple gesture evolves into a shooting that turns into a threat of international chaos and eventually results in the death of a true innocent. Of the many great films that came out in 2006, it is difficult to imagine a more universally substantial and relevant work of cinematic art than this one.by Author-Poet Aberjhani, author of ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance""",Babel

This movie fails not just because of those faults, but because it tries so unsuccessfully to avoid them. It aspires to a type of visual literature without enough substance in its construction. In so doing it gives us characters who are not endearing, a complete lack of resolution of its story and an overwhelming feeling of ""So What?"" at its completion.

The storytelling of mixing timelines and stories in a blurry mess is in my opinion a really powerful effect, but in this movie, the stories weren't well enough bound together so the effect didn't work for me. Mixing timelines didn't feel necessary for the movie even though this difference is clearly brought up multiple times. Also jumping from story to another didn't give meaningful transitions before right at the end of the movie when all is tied together and stories are resolved. Also the ending wasn't as meaningful as it is revealed (or at least two of the three stories) pretty early in the movie and no more conclusion is done in the end. I really wanted to like the movie and I liked the way of telling the story, but the loose ties between stories and not really bringing the stories together pushed me bit off. Maybe a second viewing of the movie would make it better as I could focus more on the artistic side right from the start. For now, this will not be going to my top list.",Babel

He must have thought he'd only have one chance to make a movie, had three ideas and didn't have the wisdom or confidence to split them up. As soon as the initial incident occurs I have only one concern. But instead of staying where the interest is, the director takes us from the heart of the movie and moves us from pillar to post and back again to barely tangential contacts with the main event, weaving way too much detail until I no longer care about any of these stories. Each story has potential on its own but their combination was made on the flimsiest of premises, the cliché that we're all the same all over the world.

It has a simple plot that is narrated beautifully and is a worthwhile movie.The main strength of this movie is its powerful story. Firstly the narration and cuts between the stories have made a simple plot entertaining and engaging. Secondly, there are many scenes in which you know or guess something awful is about to happen; this gives you thrilling suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat. For example, in the bus scene, I was excitedly holding my breath from the beginning until I found out where the bullet lands. Finally, the underlying symbolism of the rifle that shows how a simple object can connect many people from different continents and the relationship with the name of the movie itself is another intriguing point.Another thing to enjoy its movie is the soundtrack and the atmosphere of each story. The music by Gustavo Santaolalla is heart-warming and captivating. Furthermore, it gives a different atmosphere and feeling to each plot which further distinguishes individual narratives. I replayed the end credits multiple times to hear the music over and over. For the music alone, this is a movie that I can recommend.In conclusion, Babel is a powerful movie with a strong narrative and captivating music by a strong director and is a must-watch for anyone enjoying González's movies.",Babel

The entire Japanese sequence, other than providing some background as to where the rifle came from, was little more than a vehicle to introduce some gratuitous nudity into the film that had nothing to do with the main story line.Watch this one in 4x Fast Forward with captioning turned on, and you won't miss a bit of story.

It was devoid of details that make you like the story and characters and want to be in it. It lacked scenes that went in an unexpected way, it lacked charming visual details. The side characters such as the bus passengers, the wedding guests, the Japanese teenagers were utterly forgettable.I feel like the directors had techniques to make you care than to have somebody almost die. And so, the bus passengers are just there sucking uo screen time and doing nothing - the script doesn't need any of them to die, and the movie makers couldn't think of having them do something else interesting to justify making people spend time looking at them.I felt like the people behind it had watched Magnolia and wanted to copy the stucture and general feel of the movie - and then added some hints of political elements taken from the headlines of a fast glipmse at a news site (""Terrorism"", ""Illegal crossing over the Mexican border"", ""International game hunting sparks controversy"". To be more hip. And then you get this bland, charmless movie.Obviously the quality of directing and actors merits more than a 2.

344,karhukissa,Inarritu can do better than this,7,2 March 2007,"I am not one of the ""great Inarritu fans"", though I really liked ""21 grams"". I can't even say I expected too much from Babel. Surprisingly, I was disappointed in the things I expected more from, and pleasantly surprised by some others.The star actors, for example, caused a disappointment. I wasn't too impressed by either Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett. I kept feeling they were only cast to have some ""big names"" that would attract the audience. The acting of the no-name amateurs (the Moroccan boys, the deaf Japanese girl) was much more convincing.Of course, Brad and Cate weren't lucky in the sense that they got the worst of the 4 story lines. The ""European tourist ending up desperate in the middle of Africa""-scenario is too familiar from films like Bertolucci's ""The Sheltering Sky"" or the Dogma production ""The King is Alive"". The influence of these films is way too visible - in the room Blanchett waits in for the ambulance, or in the kinds of tourists there are on the bus. Except that the other too films are way deeper and much less sensational. The element that all this happens to a marriage in crisis (though stolen from Bertolucci, of course) seemed interesting at first, until it turned out that the crisis was due to their baby boy's death. Now come on! Couldn't there have been a less cliché reason? The other three stories are much more impressive. The stories of the Mexican and the Moroccan characters recall ""21 grams"" with the idea of people endangering other people's lives unwillingly, just by making the wrong decision. Though I admit I can't really sympathize with the Mexican au-pair: I would certainly not trust my children to anyone who has so little common sense (starting to walk in the desert in the middle of the night instead of waiting till morning and getting back on the road; leaving the children under a bush until she finds help, although she should see by then that she can't find her way around the desert...) The Moroccon story is predictable but very nicely done.The best plot line was the Tokyo one. The shots (some of which, I heard, were taken without permission with hand-held camcorders) really convey the hustle of Tokyo nightlife, and the part where we see a disco as a deaf person would is excellent. I also liked the idea that we only know fragments of the girl's story, and even those are uncovered gradually (see ""21 grams""). Of course a lot of films use disabled characters to raise the viewer's sympathy, but here I didn't feel this plot line was part of such a trick. Though only loosely connected with the main story, this one conveyed a feeling of isolation much more than the ones taking place in a desert; the other characters' lives are literally in danger, but the Japanese girl is much more desperate; the others have to survive in extreme conditions, she ""only"" in the metropolitan jungle. Maybe, as soon as characters start talking about their feelings, it easily ends up in banality. True desperation, true loneliness is so deep it cannot be expressed by words. Or if it is (on the note she hands over to the police officer), we never find out what these words are.",Babel

Two young boys are playing with a gun in Morocco. They shoot at a bus to test the range of the bullets. What they soon figure out is that they accidentally shot a woman. This incident sparks a series of events in America, Japan, Mexico, and Morocco. A series of events that challenges race and culture, love and hate, and the simple fact that everyone was born equal. ""Babel"" is a powerful and gripping drama.This film is scattered with great performances. Brad Pitt has a limited role, but probably the best of his career. In this movie he isn't all made up. He has graying hair and is starting to get wrinkles and bags under his eyes. Pitt is getting older and appears to be accepting that. He is great here, with an amazingly complex range of emotions. Cate Blanchett gives the least glamorous role of her career, and it's for the best; she knocks it out of the park here. Academy Award nominees Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi also give stellar performances, among the many others.The screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga is near perfection. The dialogue is stunning, and his motives are great. It is a wonderful example for those wishing to enter the profession.A couple of people have said that this film ""turns 'Crash' on its head."" This isn't true; the Best Picture winner from 2005 is more powerful and better made. Is this any reason to avoid this film? No. It was made to move, and move it did. The film can be sad, hopeful, and true. ""Babel"" is a stunning look at how language divides us, or unites us.My only problem with the film is minor. Rinko Kikuchi is great as the sexually uncontrollable Japanese girl. However, the amount they show her instability goes overboard. We get the idea after two or three graphic nude scenes. Give us an example, and then explain her problems, not keep showing them. They got it right with the violence. They showed how horrible it is, but not in a repetitive state.Don't get me wrong; Jose Gonzalez Inaritu (""Amores perros"" and ""21 Grams"") has put together a majestic movie.

They got the message.Babel is a story about the boundaries that confound mankind's ability to live in peace and the underlying connectedness that binds all mankind, that voids all boundaries. The story, however, shows just how connected we are, and how, despite our different ways of speaking, how we look, and how different our cultures operate and see the world, we are all connected by our common humanity to this planet, and that the innocent act of one person can set off a chain of events that affects the whole world.It is a very, very good film. The acting is brilliant. My only fear is, for people who are not readers, the three story lines may be hard to understand as one story with three parts. Yet, this is what makes Babel such wonderful storytelling. Well done.Spoiler?? The film even ends with the image of a daughter, stripped naked emotionally by grief at her mother's death, and her father consoling each other as they stand on the balcony of their condo tower. Nice touch.Enjoy.",Babel
350,carter-47153,The Language of Difference,10,24 August 2015,"Language. It's a defining human characteristic that is often overlooked by many. Language is a concept that carries with itself the responsibility of allowing a living being the ability to communicate and interact with the world outside of one's own mind. It also allows someone to have an interior monologue and creates a set of ""rules"" so that someone can talk ""to themselves"". This ability also allows any type of expression and without it ""a man is an island upon himself"".Language is also one of the most important elements of what can be defined as ""culture"". While previously inferred a culture cannot develop without a community developing a singular identity which communication is necessary; language also within itself lends an identity to a connected culture. When a language is looked at, it is possible to see the history and cultural makeup of a culture. By looking at American English, it is evident that America is made up of several cultures that have contributed to the language. Other conclusions that can be made solely off of the language are a historical connection to the English-speaking Europe and that due to a variety of cultural influences the language rules that are present in other languages are almost nonexistent; which represents the America of today.Speaking from experience, there are communities that have negative views regarding other cultures centered around their language. The results of these negative views include a lack of respect for someone that easily leads into mocking and a sense of xenophobia and entitlement regarding outside languages.Within the film ""Babel, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu crafts a several sectioned story that involves worldwide conflict that is a result of a domino effect due to a lack of understanding and communication with different cultures and sometimes within the same community. The title of the film is derived from the biblical story regarding The Tower of Babel. In the story, humanity attempts to build a tower so high to reach God. As recompense for such audacity, God disrupts their work by causing everybody to speak a different language in an effort to keep humanity from working together again towards a common goal.While humanity as a whole has made strides towards equality across the board (gender rights, civil rights, gender rights) there is still discrimination and presumptions that comes with an unwillingness to keep an open mind towards other ways of communication. At times this causes international conflict and sometimes it aids in affecting someone's way of life or more specifically affecting someone's workplace environment. If we can't accept that we need to be able to communicate with the rest of the world how will we be able to grow enough to where we can be happy in the world in which we live.",Babel
351,why-pinto,Bring a pillow...,5,25 November 2006,"People on this board need to stop throwing 10's around so freely. This movie was simplistic, gratuitous and WAY too long. It is a bunch well-acted, painful, unnecessarily tied-together vignettes that supposedly say something like ""people do not listen"". However, not much actually happens and I only got the impression that the writers could not come up with a single, coherent story and instead used a series of half-baked events to cover that fact. Sad, too, since the directing was snappy and the performances very lifelike (not you, Pitt...that guy should stick to looking and acting cool). To beat the horse further- if you've got a story develop it. Do not neuter it by placing it in some phony and self-righteous ""larger perspective"".

352,finnerss,Inarritu manages to embarrass Mexico... AGAIN,1,18 February 2007,"Warning - SpoilersPut simply, after the morbid journey of ""Amores Perros"" which relies on gore, violence, sex related subjects, blood and the same kind of ""Reality clinching"" scams that Alfonso Cuaron for example has used again to play the ""look at us poor Mexicans, everything's dirty here, everything is poor, lighting is poor, places are lacking in elegance"" as Cuaron did with his pathetic direction of Harrry Potter 3, Inarritu manages to go again on this bleak side of Mexican Cinema.Violence against animals, played out as ""look I'm a director with the balls to shoot it"" while the real talent lies in not having to rely on these pretty cheap artifacts which are easier to accomplish than an elegant story told with brilliance.You can feel from minute one, (by the way, this he does also embarrassing the Morocco people by comparing them to our Mexican sub-cultures, for example, the maids, and the Mexican babysitters, in other words, employed and only belittled by people in the United StateS) reality is very different, we ourselves, who live in the cultured part of Mexico (where Inarritu comes from too), people are clean, shaved, well dressed, and we're not barbaric as we've seen portrayed in all Inarritus movies, it is obvious that a sick writer like Guillermo Arriaga (who those who are cultured don't like at all, starting with myself) manages to portray all that can be offensive, vulgar, and sex oriented.Inarritu this time couldn't even spare the sex part and this time he justifies it with the oriental culture which is an offense as well, the same topic would have been successfully played out without having to show the girl's genitals, the violence with animals could be portrayed without showing the barbaric way in which poultry is killed, and without portraying the drama with the Jackals.You can see the ""dirtiest"" side of Mexico as well by showing the poorest part of the country's story, based in sub-cultures which have 1 or 10 people who know how to read or speak properly even in Spanish (embarrassing places like the north of our country).This story would have probably been a good one were it not for the painful taste-lacking cinematics which are being exploited by our Mexican representatives, who are all boosted by tons of money, tons of mixed interests which Mexican cinema doesn't like to talk about, and making a huge killing in revenues by playing this ""look at how well done is this movie that is so real, so bleak as reality, so lacking in illumination, so lacking in taste overall"".This side is being exploited in a way that has been undignifying to so many of Mexico's people including myself. our real filmmakers are Guillermo del Toro, or even Paco del Toro who's also sold himself a bit to this part which is so profitable because few movie makers dare to denigrate themselves and their roots as Inarritu and Cuaron.I'd hope that movies like Amores Perros, Y tu mama tambien (by another well-known sick filmmaker and with Cuaron's hands mudding it too), Babel, as so many other movies would stop being our face to the rest of the world.Let's support real filmmakers who are more eager to create art rather than to fill their pockets with this distasteful selling campaign. Good filmmakers would include (EDIT), Guillermo and Paco del Toro, and people like Adolfo Martinez Solares (who has himself some pretty cheap schemes but at least he's more loyal to his principles) who are really movie impassioned people.Inarritu for the worlds knowledge is one of the protégées of the Mexican most morbid media monopoly in Mexico, a created ""idol"" by tons of money, who first was pushed into radio with the same deceiving marketing strategies until we all were sick of him. Then he goes to Cinema where he just gets his name and ""plays"" director, while he still doesn't know anything about real film-making that takes talent, that word is invisible in his dictionary, whether in English, Spanish, or any other language.Shame on you again, Inarritu.p.s The edit was related to Luis Peje Mandoki who has found his way to fall from grace after the film ""fraude"".",Babel
353,dredyoung,Babel - Old and New,9,4 December 2006,"The raw, natural staging of Babel's characters helped make it very realistic. The aging of Pitt added authenticity. Pitt was good and Blanchett had very few lines but they were well executed. The rest of the actors were unknowns but did extremely well.Babel was similar to Crash but spread across continents. What a great commentary it was on how our new mix-mash world culture has evolved to create unbridgeable misunderstandings and catastrophes both in local settings within families and between families and foreigners and with the same interactions occurring in settings on a global scale while the news of these events involving them are broadcast, instantaneously, from anywhere to everywhere. The people in these catastrophes are presented as good, well-meaning persons, doing what, for their place in their culture, job, and situation, is normal or even obligatory. In other words, horrible consequences are unwittingly perpetrated by well-intentioned people caught in a blindly insensitive and often brutally, haphazardly evolved world-structure. It was often harrowing to watch but, as for instructing viewers in an intelligent perspective on the current mangled state of global culture, it was a mission well accomplished. Accolades go to the writer and director!",Babel
354,Ndirsch11,"'Babel' a Tough, Gritty, Challenging Film",9,8 November 2006,"""If you want to be understoodlisten."" Thus, goes the tagline for 'Babel', the new film starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Taking place in four different countries around the world and featuring many different languages, 'Babel' is certainly no small or insignificant movie. Its scope is global and its themes are universal. 'Babel' is one of those rare films that actually pushes the medium of film-making to a new level. It's an unforgettable movie that will certainly provoke a reaction even from the most jaded of viewers.The film's title is an obvious reference to the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel. For those not familiar with it, the story tells of how the people of earth desired to build a tower that could reach the heavens. When God heard of this, he scattered the people all around the world and confused their speech into different languages so that they would not understand each other. The Biblical reference is not accidental. The film makes the suggestion that the contemporary world, despite all our technology and advances, still serves to keep people apart rather than bring people together. We're unable to bridge the gap between languages, cultures, and governments.The film opens on a barren stretch of desert. An old man is walking alone and having difficulty breathing in the harsh environment. He comes home to his family who live miles from civilization. Almost immediately, the audience understands that we're in a third world country where every day is a test of survival. The old man gives his two kids a rifle to use to protect their livestock from the jackals of the open desert. The kids leave and begin to use the rifle for target practice. In the horizon, a lone bus can be seen driving down along a stretch of highway. One kid takes aim, shoots, and hits his target. The result is a little more than he bargained for.We learn shortly thereafter that an American tourist has been shot and desperately in need of medical attention. Cate Blanchett plays the American tourist whose husband, played by Brad Pitt, seems to have dragged her along for a vacation in Morocco that neither is particularly enthused about. The implications of this opening scene are catastrophic as they set the entire plot of the film in motion. The two children with the rifle didn't mean to actually shoot anyone. But will anyone believe their side of the story? 'Babel' provides us with a window into the human soul. The whole movie is an appeal to humanism. There are no good guys or bad guys here, only good intentions. The film shows how a disparity often exists between the intentions of our actions and the subsequent results. Also, the way we are understood is confused by the way people interpret our motives. Communication, or the lack of it, is the overriding theme of the film.There are other stories intertwined throughout the film. One story involves a deaf Japanese girl, played by Rinko Kikuchi, who still suffers from the memory of her mother's suicide. Another subplot involves an illegal immigrant from Mexico, played by Adriana Barraza, who works as a nanny in San Diego. Each of these stories is equally important and equally heartbreaking.'Babel' is one of the most challenging films to come out in recent years. There are some tough scenes that might be a bit much for some people. I'm glad, however, that the film's director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, was willing to be so provocative. 'Babel' strikes such a powerful chord because of how it deals with modern-day issues like terrorism and illegal immigration. There's something to be learned from a film like this and its message is badly needed.",Babel

356,astosic,"Visually stunning cinematography, but still crap.",1,10 September 2006,"Just saw this at Toronto's festival, where it's been highly anticipated... the city's plastered with ""Babel"" posters. The cinematography is sumptuous, as it the editing, and there are some great performances from the cast. But the story telling.... meh, not so much. Although it will be praised and fawned over, and doubtless get a whack of Oscar nominations, this is a tedious film that never really succeeds in linking the disparate stories in an adequate way. (especially the Tokyo story - could've lost it entirely, and saved 45 minutes of my time). Smart move for Gael Garcia Bernal to do a flick with Pitt and Blanchett... it'll propel him further into the spotlight in North American cinema. The only messages I got from this movie is that we are apparently supposed to feel sorry for the tragedies that result when people do stupid, stupid things; and, that destroying the lives of many is alright, so long as it works out for few.",Babel
357,jacobclark512,Incredible Thematic Depth,8,4 March 2014,"Thematically, Babel is one of the richest films I have ever seen. Its four narratives revolve around two themes: cause and effect and language. The language barrier is involved to varying degrees in the different narratives. In Morocco, Richard is unable to get help for his wife Susan after she is shot because he knows no Arabic. Meanwhile, in Japan Chieko is a deaf-mute that struggles communicating with anyone except her friends. She often internalizes her difficulty and is lonesome, longing for a sexual relationship. In Mexico, Santiago is unable to reason at all with a border officer and, as a result, has to risk the lives of his aunt Amelia and the children in her care. All of these narratives are weaved together by one cause: Susan's shooting. Amelia never would have needed to take the two children (who are Richard and Susan's) to her son's wedding in Mexico if it weren't for them not being able to come home from Morocco. Chieko never would have revealed her inner struggle to a police officer if he hadn't come looking for her father, whose rifle was used in the shooting. And two Moroccan boys would never have been able to shoot Susan if it weren't for Chieko's father giving one of their father's friends his gun. However, these connections make the film's plot hard to follow at times, making the viewer strain to see the relation. Every other aspect of the movie is top-notch. The cinematography is excellent and accurately captures the different tones of each individual story. The script is excellent because of it multilingualism, as four languages are used: English, Spanish, Arabic, and Japanese. The score also captures the location of each narrative, with the local musical preference being used for each location. The acting is also stupendous, with Brad Pitt giving the best performance of his entire career. Honestly, this is one amazing movie. It's definitely not for everyone because of its depth, but those who can read between the lines will love this one. I know I did.",Babel

I was deeply moved by and became involved in all three of the stories presented. The various actors are excellent, especially the young deaf-mute Japanese girl, who brings a combination of vulnerability and realness to her work that is simply breathtaking.Despite being complex, because of the interveaving stories and the necessity of filming in a number of languages, the film fits together well.This movie won't be for everyone. It is, however, unique; a mesmerising meditation on communication/miscommunication, and how this leads to potential misunderstanding as well as beautifully redeeming moments when people do connect with each other for the first time.",Babel
359,RVBUILDER,There's two and a half hours I'll never get back!,4,24 April 2007,"I gave this movie a 4 out of 10 because I enjoyed the insights into several cultures, especially modern frenetic (teenage) Tokyo. That having been said, I am not one for psychological movies, and I totally missed the deep significance of all the personal relationships that other reviewers have mentioned. My bad. I wasn't looking for a shoot-em-up, but if I wanted to see a movie where the time line was all screwed up, I'd watch ""Pulp Fiction"" again. I really had no idea what the point of the movie was, other than to show some miserable goings-on that were loosely related and really caused by no one.I was a little skeptical about Moroccan authorities tracing the gun so fast, but then I realized the Tokyo scenes must have taken place well after the Moroccan ones, similarly to the Mexican scenes taking place prior to the events in Morocco. The time shifting was too subtle for me, and quite annoying.I was happy that Cheiko didn't take a swan dive off her balcony, because I felt sure that was coming. And it seems pretty strange that a reasonably attractive girl would have such a hard time hooking up with someone, whether or not she was a deaf mute.",Babel

Had I known, had I seen this film I might have understood. This movie is poetry, and a great, I say GREAT example of telling a story with what used to be commonly known as a 'plot'. Something happens, which the audience actually sees, that directly leads to complications that the characters must confront and overcome. It checks out believably and in the process you get sucked in.

Babel isn't the greatest film of all time but it's not that bad.The story is, in parts, excellent.First off 2 Moroccan kids firing a 270 cal rifle at a tour bus and by accident killing a passenger and then having the government think it's a terrorist attack is brilliant.Secondly and it's probably the weakest part is the nanny ,of the woman who got shot, children pretty much kidnaps them and takes them to a wedding! Thirdly is a Japanese girl who is deaf and sexually depressed is a funny but otherwise boring concept.Yes it's moments like that that shine but sometimes you don't think that they intertwine correctly Acting is fine but on the whole Babel is a great film but a long film",Babel
362,singwaileung-1,Indeed...,6,20 May 2007,"Firstly, user Adlion 94, very well said! Your comments on young kids masturbating being more of a taboo subject than young kids shooting at police and random buses is rather...inspiring to say the least. I don't know why it is the comment on the front page though.Anyways, Babel is a film that is very much Crash - esquire(the site doesn't let me type e.s.q.u.e.) A non-linear narrative with different sub plots, broken down, spread around all over the place and then finally submerged together to become a film about the lives of different people from all over the world who are in some ways connected to a life-changing event. Babel is, as these films usually are, nicely filmed, exquisitely edited, and well acted. But the connections of these stories are some what weaker than that in Crash, and as soon as you are introduced to the characters, you already know exactly their significance in the story. Let me just give an easier word to what I'm trying to say - its predictable. There you go, why didn't I just say that in the first place? The stories of each character, I feel, are too centralised on them rather than their connections to the main plot. The Japanese guy giving his voluntary tour guide the rifle - which makes up his connection with the shooting - is quite a poor way of showing why he is involved. Of all the plots, I do feel that the Japanese one could become an interesting film in itself.Over all, Babel is a decent movie. But it doesn't have you engaged in it as Crash or even 21 Grams. Some of the scenes sometimes drag on too much. It's been a bad year for films in 2006. But of Babel and Departed, there's no doubt the better film lost - Departed was terrible.

Some believe - based on their ratings - that it informs, baloney!The 2 young boys who are just given a high powered rifle by their father - never having used any gun before - is credible?

The film tells an obvious if at times disjointed tale with few characters you get to care about. The cinematography is better than average but for me the sloppy editing and stereotypical performances from Pitt and Blanchett left me cold. It's time Blanchett played something other than a sulky harridan and extended her acting wings a little. Koji Yashuko totally out performed Blanchett , in fact the North African section of the movie, which should have been the driving force for the whole film was turgid to the extreme. Due on the whole to lack luster performances from the so called Hollywood stars. The African performers did well but sadly couldn't make up for their supposed acting betters poor contributions.

366,madalina_roca,The Tower of Babel,10,28 January 2010,"Watching Innaritu's Babel was a mesmerizing experience. The movie, as its title suggests, deals with the inability to communicate. This lack of communication is caused by problems on many levels: the political and social level- globalization and immigration; linguistic level- the inability to communicate caused by the different languages the characters speak- Spanish, English, Japanese,sign language; emotional level- lack of understanding and empathy.Babel follows the same non-linear storytelling as Innaritu got us used to in 21 grams and Amores Perros. Innaritu manages to weave a complex story out of four story lines. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's performances were excellent as usual, Adriana Barraza is absolutely great in her nanny role, especially in the desert scene, crying for help in her teared red dress. But Rinko Kikuchi was sublime playing the young, deaf Japanese girl. She managed to convey a range of emotion no words could have expressed. She shows the isolation and loneliness of the modern man living in an artificial town. She is unable to reveal herself because she is seen as a monster due to her deafness. Through her gestures( touching hands, taking off her panties) she displays her craving for human contact and understanding. Nudity in her case is the ultimate gesture of disclosure,the desperate act of making herself visible.",Babel

Look, I already know that our lives are interconnected. Is there anyone UNAWARE of that? Howover, there was no overall theme tying the individuals together other than that of chance, that made me feel compelled in the remotest fashion to follow them to the movie's end. I didn't even find the individual story lines of interest...the Japanese girl, especially, I found to be unnecessarily coarse. Overall, to paraphrase Gertrude, there was no movie there, just movie-making. And they're two different things.Gave up on it in about an hour--fortunately saw it on DVD checked out of the library.

This movie is about how people all over the world want the same thing: a chance for a better life and how sometimes choices made to attain that better life end up not being the right ones. Also the movie is about how people need to communicate about the big AND small things in life instead of bottling it up (under the rug swept only works for so long) and it's about the need for emotional contact, reaching out to one another instead of looking for reasons to hate without justifiable reason.

369,GanzEhrlich,Beautiful film,9,12 December 2014,"Two pre-teen brothers essentially playing with a new rifle in the Moroccan desert stupidly decide to fire at a bus tour. The bullet then hits Californian tourist Susan Jones in the shoulder and she and her husband Richard struggle to find help in an unfamiliar world. Across the Atlantic, a nanny looking after the Jones' children, takes them to her son's wedding in Mexico unable to find anyone else to look after the kids and gets into trouble. In Japan, police want to talk to Yasujiro Wataya, who originally owned the rifle that he gave in Morocco. This is how a single careless gunshot can create ripples around the world. This is Babel.Babel is a film about humanity and its troubles in nature and writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu has written an amazing story to tell it, which covers a lot of depressing situations through a range of characters, all with problems in their lives. Richard Jones wanted to go to Morocco with his wife to be alone. Yasujiro's daughter Chieko is deaf-mute and is also sexually frustrated, causing a lot of incidents for herself and others, most notably with the police officer in her apartment. Nanny Amelia is irresponsible at times, leaving the Jones children in the desert with the high chance of them dying.Just about everyone did an amazing job. Brad Pitt was outstanding, the supposedly inexperienced Moroccans were touching, as was Adriana Barraza (Oscar-nominated for her performance), while Cate Blanchett, Gael García Bernal and Kôji Yakusho did good jobs to fit in. But Pacific Rim star Rinko Kikuchi had the most demanding role as the deaf-mute Chieko, her character being so fragile, specific and emotional. Kikuchi has so convincing, she fully deserved the Oscar- nomination she was given. Although I am yet to see any of the other nominees performances, Kikuchi would have been a worthy winner.The film's visuals and cinematography were astounding, again right to be nominated by the Academy. The images of broad deserts and city-scapes kept my eyes wide open. Iñárritu used appropriate camera angles, low and calm during normal conversation or quiet scene, shaky and rushed during scenes of panic and chaos e.g. Susan getting shot in the shoulder. I also thought Iñárritu's decision to have a few shots from Chieko's perspective, with the sound completely muted to give the audience the feeling of being deaf, was also impeccable.The only thing I didn't like about Babel was that it was too long, it dragged particularly in the middle when Amelia and the kids are in the desert or in the village where Susan recovers. But otherwise, a great art-house film, with so many powerful, remarkable scenes, such as when the boy who fired at the bus surrenders to the police to admit responsibility. Although there were other films in 2006 that have had more of an impact on culture than Babel and have received more popularity, this film fully deserved to be nominated for Best Film at the Oscars. A mesmerizing tour-de-force.After seeing a film by Iñárritu now I am looking forward to seeing Birdman even more when it comes out.",Babel
370,BlackMan90,8/10,8,16 July 2007,"Talking isn't the only form of communicationA shot from a rifle brings together the lives of a Moroccan family, an American couple named Richard and Susan, (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett), a Mexican nanny named Amelia (Adriana Barraza), and a Japanese teenager named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi).Guillermo Arriaga's script is quite good, despite one scene. The situations that these realistic characters find themselves in show, how people from their various cultures react to adversity.Direction: Inarittu's direction is very inconsistent. Like Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' the look of each segment is different so you tell each apart. When Inarittu is on, he can use just Gustavo Santaolalla's score and a simple shot to express emotion. Inarittu gets the audience so emotionally invested in these people, that when the film ends, we'd wanna know how these people will continue their leaves after these traumatic events. The cinematography, editing, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score are all top-notch. Santaolalla's guitar is always present, never clichéd, and Inarittu uses it perfectly. When he's off, the film gets weaker. There is one specific scene that is arguably the most unnecessary scene I've ever seen in my life. It affects the story in no way and provides no entertainment to the audience. The weakest storyline, set in Japan, is the most flawed. Several scenes (except the final one) contain nudity that is used for shock-value, in my opinion, rather than for art. Also, during a key scene in Chieko's where the audience sees things from the viewpoint of Chieko runs too long, turning what could've been a beautiful scene into a tedious sequence.Inarittu's direction falters at times, but he has assembled one of the best casts of the year. All traces of Brad Pitt's stardom disappears here. With his cracked skin and graying hair, Brad Pitt gives his second best performance (To Fight Club of course). He shows all layers of Richard. From the guilty man trying to reconcile his marriage, to the angry husband trying to get his wife help, to the sobbing father whose breaks down talking to his son whose is thousands of miles away. One of the best actresses in the game, Cate Blanchett also delivers her 2nd best performance (To Heaven, of course). She spends much of the film doing the same thing, but she makes her scenes memorable and her coldness towards Brad Pitt's warmth is top-notch. Pitt and Blanchett's anti-chemistry is great. Adriana Barraza's character, Amelia, isn't very showy, but it allows a veteran actress like Barraza the room to give a truly perfect performance. Every emotion, facial expression, and line delivery is on point. Her final scene is one of the most heart-breaking scenes of the film. This is the 1st I've seen of Gael Garcia Bernal and I'm impressed. He is wild, out-of-control, & dangerous and Bernal shows it. Rinko Kikuchi is good, but not great. Her final scene is her only truly great acting. Her performance is natural, but she at times she makes her character unlikable. Koji Yashimoto gives a very good performance as Chieko's father. He steals every scene that he's in. I'm slightly ashamed to say that I don't know the names of the Moroccan people. I call them people, because they aren't professional actors, but they all give great thorough performances. Ensemble casts usually give great performances and this is no exception.OVERALL: Despite Inarittu's sporadic weak direction, the stories and the strong cast help this thought-provoking drama.",Babel
371,pwteatros,"Pretentious, pointless and boring",2,11 February 2007,"This movie was pretentious, pointless and boring. I am big fan of Amores Perros and the first to support hispanic artists. But this movie was simply silly. Unlike Amores Perros, Memento and similar movies, this never comes together. The Japanese story could and should be a whole movie in itself. The north African story doesn't work because we never get to care a bit about the wife and because those 2 kids in north Africa are simply annoying. Then the Mexico story had the most implausible casting since they had white people playing black characters in Hollywood in the name of gael garcia bernal. Like, yeah, he is from Mexico, but no he clearly didn't belong to that family. It was funny to see European looking gael as the only family member of this very mestizo family. Hey, it does happen, but it there are at least 2 or 3 good hispanic, medium profile actors who could have played that role without distracting because of their skin colour but they went for the most overexposed actor in Latin America to raise the profile of this movie. All in all, a waste of time.",Babel
372,robwealer,Did not like this film..,5,2 March 2007,"Not sure why this film garnered so much attention.. it is an awkward weave of an old device (linking events around the globe in a ""6 degrees"" fashion) in an attempt to bind all players in a single bond of experience and humanity which it really fails to do. It's popularity I think was dependent on neophyte's first forays into cultural cosmopolitanism and the viewer's need to have a view affirmed in an artsy fashion, something they can point to and say they understand and gain membership in the ""in"" club of actual perception of the world. The wide open spaces pages left in dialog lend to this and minimal footnoting for understanding of each character. The story is also persistent in lack of commitment to individual characters. This is like a franchised art effort, stripped down to appeal to wide interpretation and pick up wind in all demographics. This movie will not be remembered or on the tongues of film buffs for very long.",Babel
373,PLRD,Technically Superior Concoction of Clichés,7,13 June 2007,"This multinational adventure/drama of inter-woven lives is a technically superior concoction of anti-American bias and rich-boy liberal guilt, with an anti-gun subtext and threads of soft-core kiddie porn. The clichéd Pitt character, an inconsiderate unreasonable ugly-American, does the screaming and yelling that passes for acting with a lot of people. The robot-like U.S. Border Patrol and INS employees are inhuman and heartless, American values and pop-culture have infected the developed nations and corrupted the lives of their citizens, while the generous residents of the third-world are unselfish to the point of saintliness. I won't even comment on the uses to which some of the under-age characters are put. I haven't read all the comments here, but one I noted suggests that the separate stories are brought together in a transcendent climax with the precision of a Japanese puzzle box (or, for the younger generation, transformer toy). Don't count on it. But it *will* make you think.",Babel
374,intersan,must see,9,3 June 2007,"When I first started watching this film, I expected the entire film to have subtitles in English. After the scene switched to Morocco, English was, for the most part, dropped except by the Americans and a few others. I was almost ready to return it without finishing it, but it gradually became clear that I could understand the elements of what was happening without understanding the languages.I think the most touching part was the deaf Japanese girl who was a troubled teen acting out after the death of her mother, but who couldn't connect with her stoic father. All the situations, the Mexican and Moroccan as well, showed that humanity doesn't always need language to understand the emotions shared by all of us.This was truly a masterpiece, one to think about for a long time.",Babel
375,Charles_LePoje,The short film about a winchester rifle or why can't we just get along,9,14 November 2006,"A definitive post 9/11 film, 'Babel' depicts how the fear of terror broadens cultural misunderstandings and shows how some of the ripple effects of the growing climate of mistrust tragically reverberate on the lives of its innocent international protagonists. Make no mistake about it: 'Babel' is a contemporary social drama with lethal political undertones. It is also a thinly veiled, gentle but evocative critical reflection on some of the grim realities broth forth by the aggressive, intolerant foreign policy missteps our leaders have undertaken in the wake of the horrific September 11 events.'Babel' is all about borders; geographical, cultural, ethnic, as well as those most delicate - psychological. Invisable obstacles that keep parents from understanding their children, nations from trusting one another, ethnic groups from overcoming deep-seated prejudices . The West is as far away from the (Middle)East as it has ever been. At the crux of one of the three story lines that the film weaves in a zig-zag fashion is the harsh, crude and heartless treatment of a Mexican nanny who had lived illegally in America for 16 years. Although never explicitly elaborated as resulting from the atmosphere of fear that permeates our new realities, it is indeed hardly imaginable that the film's depiction of the dry, totalitarian and cold-hearted demeanor of the American immigration officials would hold water in a serious pre-9/11 film. Ideally and idealistically, if our leaders had made the strategic decision of resolving foreign policy issues by building bridges of understanding rather than bombing real ones, it is hard to imagine that a film like 'Babel' would have come into being. A genius artistic master stroke, one that reveals the film's topicality and political undertones, is the selection of a film's title. With this act, single-handedly, the creative team behind the film points its thematic inspiration towards the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. Thus, with a sophisticated hint, certainly not accidental, the film's gravitas is centered in Iraq, the ancient cite of Babylon, where biblical Tower of Babel was to be erected.The single conduit of the film's main theme, the one item connecting all stories, is a Winchester rifle, a vintage American firearm. One could argue that the make of the rifle is insignificant. That could easily be the case in an average movie, written by a mediocre screenwriter, directed by an untalented director. But nothing is accidental where masters are at work.Would the relevant ideas that the authors wanted to convey still be the same if the weapon of choice was Italian made Beretta pistol Parabellum - equally well known to weapon collectors worldwide? One should think not. American made weaponry figures prominently in the ongoing 'war on terror'. This very war that has come to be so divisive that clash of civilizations is no more a remote possibility. More American made weapons have been used in the wars of the 21st century than from any other country by a wide margin. If a single rifle can cause such devastating havoc, one can ponder the extent of horror caused by the massive amounts of weaponry unleashed in Afganistan and Iraq, both Moslem countries.Indeed, as depicted in this film, it is an innocent Moslem family from Marocco that suffers irreparable tragedy. Whereas in other two story lines that the film follows there is a possibility for redemption and hope, in the segment taking place in Marocco life is permanently shattered and innocence forever lost. It would be anything but hypocritical to argue the indisputable fact that in the current conflicts in and around Iraq the biggest victims are innocent Moslem families. The real movie stars in this smart movie are not Hollywood heavy-weights. They are merely here as a marketing draw. If their characters were played by lesser known names, it is more than probable that this film would sink into art house obscurity. The true stars of the film, the very talented actors delivering the strongest dramatic punch are, at least to the wide American movie-going public, all ethnic unknowns.Apart from its slight political ramifications, 'Babel' is an ode to fatherhood. Innaritu's dedication to his children, is a dead give-away for one of his thematic strands. Fatherhood, as opposed to parenthood, is at the core of his philosophical musings. In each of the tree segments, all involving children, the absence of a pivotal role of a mother is quite evident. In the Japanese segment this is especially true since the whole focus is on a strictly father-daughter relationship in the aftermath of their family tragedy. The Moslem mother in the Moroccan family is portrayed as passive and was given no prominent role. During a bus tour through desolate Maroccan country side, Kate Blanchet's character is wounded early on and thus somewhat sidelined. Brad Pitt, the father, is the spokesman of the family's trials and tribulations. None of these facts dilute the dynamics and dramatics of the story. They are merely a reflection of the proud role a father figure is given in Latin American culture, the culture from which both the writer and the director stem its artistic influences. In the current dangerous political climate of mistrust in which we are just about to start erecting a wall alongside Mexican border, we should be careful that the wall is not too tall. Otherwise we could come to a point where the wall is so tall that even the artists the likes of Guillermo Arriaga, the writer of this important film, nor its director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu, could climb over it. Or worse yet, they don't want to.",Babel
376,tadeo38,A very emotional films with some very harsh lessons,9,29 November 2006,"The description currently being carried as the ""Viewers Choice"" is truly inaccurate in several respects, but does at least capture a pronounced need for an Intelligent Viewer to choose this film. First of all, it has virtually nothing to do with ""Communication"" but rather is based on (for the most part American) our total failure to understand other cultures. And secondly, the three tales are hardly suddenly wound together at the end....they are an integral part of the story-telling skillfully tieing the elements together very logically. The thought that it lacks the ""soul"" of Inarritu's two superb earlier works is simply not true; if anything, it carries a much more powerful punch and emotional impact. The one thing that struck me more so that anything else, is the ease with which the Director so seamlessly edits these stories in such a way that they viewer is easily transported through the three locales, which certainly could not be said of Clint Eastwood's earlier work in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which was edited so poorly that he left most viewers frustrated and bewildered. A must see for those IMDb'ers that can handle the often sad consequences of actions which just happen to the various characters in ways in which they could not have imagined.",Babel
377,Haynerator,"Brilliant Concept, Poorly Executed",2,21 September 2008,"I saw this at the cinema with my parents when it was released in the UK. I had heard some reviews about it, rating it to be quite good - on top of this the concept intrigued me. So I went with my parents to see this film at the cinema, so it started off OK, and I was remaining open minded about it because it wasn't far into it. But as it went on, I found my self getting quite bored and losing interest despite still being able to follow the storyline. The film has a fairly slow pace which is not for all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying a film I like has to be a really punchy, no stops thrill ride or anything - There is just a limit to how slow a pace I can handle.So basically, there are a set of individual stories, and everybody is tied to a Japanese man giving a gun to his Moroccan hunter friend. So with the main story we see how this transaction affects several people across the world. There is a large portion (well, seemingly larger than the rest) of the film which seems to focus on the Japanese man's daughter, Cheiko, she is a deaf, nymphomaniac teenager and her mother has committed suicide. We see how she struggles in life, fine, but she is indirectly affected by the actions of her father. The other characters in the film are all affected by the gun in a direct way. The only link to Cheiko is that the person who gave the gun away is her father, she is in no way affected by how the gun was used to affect several people across the world.Cheiko didn't fit in, and in my opinion was a lame excuse to show some unnecessary full frontal nudity. Cheiko to me was like the last piece from a different puzzle you slam into place because it's a bit misshapen. People may think Cheiko's story was the most interesting or whatever, which is fine, on it's own I won't dispute that to some it might be a great story. But try and fit it into place with the flow of the main storyline and she's attached very loosely.The film was like seeing a bunch of consequences to an action we know very vaguely about, (and I'm talking about the transaction of giving the gun away to those who think the action was firing the gun off the cliff). Chieko's father is the cause, and we learn nothing about him. We don't learn for certain his reasons behind giving the gun away, and we don't learn anything about his character.If Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett weren't in this film, this movie would not have made it to cinema - It would have been straight to video, bargain bin.As I said, it has a fantastic concept, being a sort of chaos theory. How one small action affects people across the world. The theme of communication, how each of the affected people have trouble talking to certain people in their lives was also interesting. On paper it sounds like a great film, but in reality it's a bit of a bore.If you have a higher tolerance of slow paces, don't get bored easily, or don't care about the flow of a story then by all means - This film is probably for you. Overall I think this movie doesn't have particularly strong characters, and the story wasn't carried through very well making this film not very enjoyable. I wouldn't want to see it again.",Babel
378,jeffandsarah-1,Listen up guys!,10,14 January 2008,"Seems to me a lot of people here did not 'listen', it was pretty obvious that no one in the movie was, but then again that is the point the movie is making. Who listens when you can talk. Perhaps Brad Pitts character when his wife wishes to pee, finally a bit of humanity in their failing relationship. Thought to consider, How did the Japanese father come to stand beside his naked daughter and not really notice. Perhaps nudism was rife in their family, though the thought i had was of prior sexual abuse, which would give meaning to his wife's suicide, Chiecko's inappropriate actions to older father figures and her inability to make friends with boys of her own age. Presumably the mothers death was prior to the hunting trip in Morocco. The Japanese portion of the movie was central to the whole theme, dysfunctional language and the loss of meaning, even more apparent when at one stage the Mexican nanny is speaking in Spanish to the American children at their home. I wonder if they knew what she was saying. All round great film.",Babel
379,katrowellpa,The Tower of Babel,7,13 May 2007,"According to the Bible, the Tower of Babel was a tower built by a united humanity to try to reach the heavens, but as the mythology goes, God was angered by this attempt by humans to think they could reach heaven, and the whole incident somehow led to the development of different races and languages. Certainly, ""Babel"" has numerous races and languages in it, as it jumps back in forth (and not always chronologically, so watch out for that!) between scenes in Morocco, America, Mexico, and Japan, but why the director Inarritu chose to title his movie ""Babel"" has never been fully explained to me.Unlike ""21 Grams"", which I found to be extremely choppy and self-indulgent, I actually thought that elements of ""Babel"" worked and were weaved together in a more cohesive fashion. For me, the most interesting storyline was that involving the character, Chieko, the Japanese deaf-mute teenager, who although her character was never fully developed, was quite fascinating. The camera-work and sound editing in her sections were outstanding, especially the scene in the Japanese disco.It was a shame that Cate Blanchett's role was so small--she seems almost wasted in her role. Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best--he really looked older and gritty. The only storyline which seemed a little unnecessary was the one involving Brad and Cate's children and their Mexican nanny--some of the things that happened in that storyline seemed over the top and not really connected to the rest of the story lines, except to show that Mexican wedding receptions can be just as cheesy as American wedding receptions.Overall, I enjoyed the movie more than I expected to and did make it all the way until the closing credits, unlike ""21 Grams"", which my husband and I walked out of when we saw it at the theater a few years ago.",Babel

The acting wasn't anything super special, and as a fan of Pitt this isn't my absolute favorite of his. However, the portrayal of all the characters kept things afloat.
As previously stated, I had not seen any of this director's work before so I found myself looking to the internet post-film for symbolism and closure.

But is it just me or was there too much of a 'Hollywood ending'? Chieko is 'rescued' by her father from what appeared to be an inevitable suicide; Jussef survives (Admittedly after losing his brother); Susan lives; Susan and Richard 'find' each other again; Amelia survives her ordeal in the desert (OK, she was deported, but not dead!); Debbie and Mike survive, despite wandering away from the point Amelia left them; Santiago seemingly escapes the law. Wow! Any other 'happy endings' I missed? In addition, you can too easily see the sub-structure of the filmit's like looking at the Statue of Liberty in a see-through gown. All those steel girders!On the bright side; is it true that many of the 'actors', especially those in the Morrocan scenes, were amateurs just signed up for this movie? If so, their performances were little short of outstanding. The major roles played by Pitt and Blanchett, Barracha, Kikuchi and Yakusho were performed with excellence.I should probably need to see this several times before I could fully interpret it, but the two obvious points are the ripple effect of the gift of a gun, and the difficultyand easeof communicating between worlds of different languages.",Babel

Class, race and society were of minor concern, however as each individual generated their own identity the culmination of aggression and confusion diminished the once prosperous universal language causing a rift that would echo even upon contemporary times. Babel illustrates global society while contrasting humanity. Undoubtedly though, Babel contradicts morality by exposing each and every one's vulnerabilities and timing. A film of this magnitude seems almost vital to current cinema, after viewing the film I was left moved, scared, informed and to a certain degree dumbstruck by the exploitation of general politics and the media. Babel isn't a film to recommend but as far as cinematic experiences go you would be hard pressed to find a film more poignant on social commentary.",Babel
384,ldoig,"Mawkish, frustrating, slow, pretentious...a movie for our age sadly",2,10 July 2007,"It takes a lot, even with a very bad film (and like you, I've seen some humdingers in my time) to be frustrated to the point that I have to forward wind the last odd ten/twenty minutes of a film as I've realised it's pointless carrying on; it's getting annoying, nothing more needs to be said, my intelligence and sense of human empathy is being insulted and I simply can't take anymore etc.I suppose I can be fair and talk about good performances and well shot scenes, but I find myself getting genuinely concerned if the western film business is going to start putting out films like this more and more. I certainly don't mean to offend, but there is something deeply, deeply wrong with western society (sorry, I guess I mean our friends across the pond and a few Brits really, rather than continental Europe, who along with many from the rest of the world would have been seriously bemused by this film) if we feel we can watch things as totally disconnected and detached as this and somehow feel that we are re-engaging with our ""humanity"". It's a falsehood.It's awfully immature to apply the ""butterfly to hurricane"" notion to human beings, it's something I find very warped, though sadly very modern too. 21 grams was superb, but it worked because it focused on a specific incident and its immediate affects to those it concerned. It did this beautifully. But when you are relating it to peoples around the planet, applying extremely tenuous links, with cultures that are terribly diverse; that the writer/director/producers clearly don't really know a great deal then your heading for trouble and this did big time. It doesn't make for a coherent story and it certainly is not good art.If I was someone from Morocco I would be asking myself ""Good God! What do these people think of us!? Is this why the Americans are blowing the s*&t out of us overhere all the time!? Do they think we are savages!?"" It simply isn't going to cut with educated audiences and I'm worried that films like this will show the rest of the world that many in the west are very well meaning, but simply divorced from the realities or their worlds, in increasingly more and more concerning ways.Worryingly, this is yet another film from ""us"" that shows human beings behaving in an extremely poor, unintelligent and (importantly) unrealistic manner. It supports this incorrect world view that many in the ""mass consumption west can"" assume about human nature and the way human beings behave in various ""conditions"". People are not stupid, do have a sense of humanity and do act well, despite the wests current psychosis, for it is that, a psychosis. Films set in this style don't help when offering pseudo-religious ideas (though probably claiming to be secular) about humanity. They essentially leave you with a sense of fear that those ""out there"", other humans, are not to be trusted, for even when well meaning, may cause things to go wrong for you. This is fraudulent, the ""real"" is simply that - immediate, ""present"" and more beautiful than you can ever imagine. It is not some distanced, detached and yet ""immaculate"" looking thing, where you can always take a step back and smugly look on events with hindsight. Western Cinema needs to fight this ""hyper-real"" style of film and offer us something far more genuine.",Babel
385,mithil293,poignantly disturbing,8,8 February 2013,"Babel surpasses all kinds of boundaries when it tries to tell the story of people splayed across the face of earth interconnected by situation and emotion. It involves characters that are very real-like and similar to people we encounter on daily basis. In Brad Pitt I have seen the most glamorous actor play the most unglamorous role of any actors career. The movies is actually derelict of extravagant dialogues or witty punch lines but it never ceases to be a roller-coaster ride of emotions. To the core the movie is about being heard by dear ones, to be able to develop that connectivity with people you hardly met and not be marginalized by things that fall well below the ladder of relevance.Although the story brings hell lot to the table, the soul lies in the character development that breathes so much of life into the movie. Almost all the the characters does incredibly emoting their words through their eyes like putting pen on paper. The other thing that movie does so efficiently is express solidarity to each other faiths and beliefs. You might be horrified or apprehensive but the movie shows it's worth being open minded then live in secluded world of xenophobia.As per my own habit I like to mention some artistically aesthetically scenes that will remain in my mind till some alien brain washes it. The old Moroccan woman passing her smoke to Susan to mitigate the pain, the little brother cover firing in order to save his injured brother and anguished father, Chieko scenes with policeman at the end were some of the best scenes. Also the scene involving US border patrol check was among the intense scenes in the movie.I have seen better International collaboration but this movie requires special mention for it's seamless and gripping screenplay. The editor of this move needs a special applaud for cutting the movie into right length without jeopardizing it's premise. I am not going to go around praising each and every actor in this movie because then I will be weighing them against each other and also I do not have the vocabulary to go through such immensely overwhelming performances. The director Alejandro González Iñárritu needs special mention too for even thinking of making such efforts.In the end I am unable to judge the portrayals since there is that air of moral ambiguity present across the movie. I feel sorry for Amelia, happy for Susan and Richard, anguish for Moroccan family and sense of achievement for Chieko. This movie may not appease to wide range of spectators but it's a like a reality on the big screen only the actors portraying the characters are pretending, rest all remains just as same and believable.",Babel

It had been a tough & tiring week and I had hoped that watching a movie will be the best way to relax. Having watched Babel, though i thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but I wouldn't say ""it was a relaxing experience"". Babel is a well thought-out, intelligent film that has also been presented and edited brilliantly. The word 'Babel' means 'a confused mixture of sounds and voices'. The movie tries to highlights the differences among various cultures and how language can prove to be a barrier among people. It is a complex interplay of four stories going around parallel to each other, but converging together at the end. Babel has some nice performances by Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, and a host of other characters whom I did not recognize. I don't think the movie was made to give users any message. It is just a story of how cultures differ and how sometimes small mistakes/decisions can lead to devastating consequences.

389,bruddah_man_matt,Our Actions Have Consequences That Go Beyond What We Can See With Our Eyes,10,13 November 2006,"First things first let's set the record straight. Babel has been unjustly criticized as a ""Crash clone"" which I assure you it most certainly is not. And even though it's supposedly the final piece in Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's ""Death Trilogy"" it differs from Amores Perros and 21 Grams quite significantly in how the story is presented to the audience. Babel differs from the aforementioned films in that most of the characters of the various narratives do not end up meeting one another before the credits roll. Whereas those films set out to show us how unrelated characters come to know one another via their actions Babel instead focuses on the individual lives of the characters of three narratives (two young boys growing up in Morocco who guard their family's Goats with a rifle, a teenage deaf-mute girl and her father living in Japan who gave said rifle to a man in Morocco and a Mexican nanny who cares for the children of Pitt and Blanchett's characters) as a fourth story which connects them (Blanchett's character getting shot by said rifle which belongs to the family of the two boys in Morocco) unfolds in the background. On that note I have to credit Innaritu for showing restraint. As interesting as it is to witness seemingly unrelated characters come together on screen it's a somewhat tired concept that's currently being done to death. Instead we are presented with deep and introspective peeks into the lives of characters who come from the most diverse of backgrounds and cultures.At first glance the broad story arc which connects the smaller narratives seems to exists only so that audiences don't view the film as a messy hodgepodge of introspective studies of human character and behavior. However, Blanchett's character getting shot is a story in itself despite the fact that the real focus of the film (at least in my eyes) is on the the lives of the characters outside that of the broader arc. By connecting the narratives Innaritu shows us how our personal problems can become global ones under certain circumstances and how our actions can affect the lives of those we'll never meet in our lifetime.However despite the connections between the narratives the deepest parts of the films come when we dive deep into the lives of the individual characters. Innaritu shows us the world through the eyes of a deaf-mute Japanese girl as she deals with the horror of her Mother's suicide and how she tries to cope sexually (the most powerful of the 4 stories in my opinion) along with a Mexican immigrant who becomes too comfortable with her lifestyle after living in America illegally for 16 years. He also shows us how a young boy must learn to accept the consequences of his reckless actions as well as how a couple go from being distant to remembering all they have after one of them is physically wounded. One of the most interesting moments occurs when we see how the other tourists who were traveling with Pitt and Blanchett's characters react to her getting shot. Some are helpful, others fearful for their own lives and some just plain selfish. Sexuality was also a major theme throughout the film and we get to see how different cultures as well as different age groups deal with the subject. I don't want to say too much as one should really experience Innaritu's vision on their own but this film touches on life itself. It's hard for me to think of a particular subject that wasn't dealt with here which is why it's so hard to keep this review under 1000 words. Life, death, joy, anger, regret, depression, innocence, responsibility, irresponsibility. This film not only spans the world in terms of it's setting, it also spans a world of topics and emotions. And speaking of the settings, the cinematography was world class. The bleak shots of Morocco contrasted exceptionally well with high tech Tokyo and it's busy skyline. The performances were also nothing short of amazing. You go from hating Blanchett to hoping she'll pull through. You shake your head at Barraza's (Amelia) character for the careless decisions she makes. And while we don't get much from him in terms of range despite being billed as the lead Pitt does not disappoint. However it's Rinko Kikuchi who steals the show here as the troubled teen Chieko. It'll be a crime if she goes unnoticed at the Oscars as her performance here was nothing short of Academy Award winning material. Innaritu has certainly outdone himself with Babel. In the end it's just too broad a film to sum up in a simple review but I will say that if there's one thing he left out, it was anything that could be criticized. Babel is simply an amazing, eye opening, mind bending film that when it's over, will have you asking yourself ""just how many lives have been affected by my actions?"" 10/10",Babel
390,pb104-1,"interesting, complex tale",8,5 September 2006,"The film opens in the Moroccan desert: an elderly tribesman trades a high-powered rifle to a goat herder for 500 diram & a goat. He hands the rifle to his two young sons and tells them to kill jackals with it, to protect the herd. As practice, the start shooting at rocks, a car passing on the hill below, and finally a bus. That's the only thing they manage to hit, putting a bullet through the shoulder of a tourist. In the middle of nowhere, there's no medical help, and no one wants to wait with the injured person except her husband. That's the setup of this complex, challenging film. It splits into four related stories, one in Japan, two in Morocco, and the last in California, where a housekeeper has to get to her son's wedding in Mexico, but has no one to watch the two children in her care. She decides to take them along, and of course things go sour. A good cast, great acting, fine cinematography, and expert direction make this film well worth watching. It's not for everyone, but for people who are ready to see deliberately paced low-key thriller, this is one good film. The split story line is reminiscent of ""Syriana,"" but in no way copies it.",Babel
391,geertvdheide,Thought provoking and very well acted,8,18 December 2007,"First of all, Babel (2006) is a movie for a select audience. Those looking for action, suspense or humor should look elsewhere. This film is, in a few words, a unique insight into a set of characters dealing with various kinds of tragedy and personal problems in their lives. There is only a hint of positivity here and there. It's a sad film but not a tearjerker. A deep film but not a mysterious film. And above all a very well-made film.The acting is simply marvelous. The actors/actresses are able to deliver complex emotions and thoughts in a subtle and understated way. The characters are well written. They feel like real life people and help to keep the movie interesting throughout.Some of this movie's message and meaning might only come across after repeated viewings or after reading a little about the movie after wards. On the other hand, this movie is not overly complex or complicated. Even still, I suggest watching this movie without distraction, and with an open mind. It will be well worth it.",Babel
392,brooz,Yhe way I see this movie.,8,5 July 2007,"This comment on the movie is my explanation of its end; because things are not told. So I explain things which I don't relate, assuming you already watched it. So if you did not, please don't read ahead.**************** BIG SPOILER AHEAD *************************(it still is no more than an interpretation)Two families have their dark secret: A Japanese mother died long ago. And an American baby kid.The American couple tries so much to assure themselves that this death was not their fault that it makes me think that it was an accident which they could have avoided. The Japanese father and daughter do not have the same story of the mother's death. But these stories have in common a bloody death and that the daughter is first on the scene. The father asked the girl if she wanted to talk to the cops. So she is the one to have troubles if the truth were to be known.These are rich families from rich countries that killed accidentally a member. They don't have trouble with justice but their demons haunt them.On the other hands you have 2 poor families from poor countries. Two kids in Marroco wound an American girl during a dumb teenage challenge. Consequences: A brother is shot; the father and remaining kid are to face a harsh justice. A neighbour is mistreated. Media freak out ""Terrorism!"". The good hearted Mexican family is caught for what they did: driving drunk are working in the states without a green card. The justice is harsh to them too.To my opinion the movie is about justice and human rights. The characters are treated gently or roughly on the basis of their nationality.",Babel
393,FMK,"No balance, no merit - Babel flies off the handle",1,3 February 2007,"Only once before in my life have I left the theater halfway through a movie. The first time was because 'The man in the iron mask' was so embarrassingly bad; with 'Babel', I left an hour into the movie because it was making me feel nauseous and my fiancée depressed. So take into account that this is a comment on half a movie.Our reactions are a testimony to the technical proficiency of the director; his harsh realism and uncompromising storytelling are so realistic we both felt physically bad. But that is the only positive thing I can say about this bleak, horrible piece of cinema.This is clearly a movie about the human condition, and by a director who is none too happy about said condition. But in his urge to show the viewer that man is stupid, selfish, and evil, he flies off the handle in a big way.There's no light in this movie, no goodness, no direction other than down. From the first scenes, with the young goat herders firing a rifle at passing cars and one of them acting on his perverse sexuality, through the indifference of the fellow passengers of the injured American woman (Blanchett), and the ominous wedding celebration that just *has* to go wrong at some point, to the lonely and frustrated existence of the Japanese schoolgirl, everything is pointed downhill.Any meaningful movie should have a topic, should investigate a part of the human condition, ask questions, provide food for thought; juxtaposition, contrast and ambiguity should be the tools of the investigation. But in Babel, while Iñárritu does have the human condition as his material, he fails entirely to make it a *topic*; he goes to town on his viewers like a rabid priest delivering a sermon of fire and brimstone.There is no ambiguity in Babel, no hope; ""the world is ugly,"" Iñárritu is saying, ""and man is bad, and my mission is to send that message as loudly as I can."" The movie asks no questions, opens no discussions, doesn't investigate; it just portrays ugliness. Undoubtedly, the movie escalates into a climax where the story lines converge, but even that essential structure is not an arc, but a straight line down into a dark pit.I deeply regret having seen even half of this movie, and will strive to miss any other movies Iñárritu has made and will make in the future.",Babel

396,MulhollandRob,"What we got here, is the failure to communicate!",10,5 November 2006,"Babel Mixing in geopolitics, along with intimate overlapping stories about parents and children, in a thematically complex and utterly compelling style, ""Babel"", is Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's third film, is the closing finale to the film trilogy that includes his groundbreaking debut ""Amores Perros"", and the raw and gripping ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" is his most ambitious, and powerful film to date.Returning with writer Guillermo Arriago, who also wrote ""Amores Perros"", and ""21 Grams"", will be the last film they will ever work on together. What a dynamic duo these two talents are, its quite possibly one of the most talented film-making duo's in the business today, other then the duo of Spike Jonez & Charlie Kaufman"" Where ""Amores Perros"" was also an affecting and powerful film, the overlapping story lines weren't as evenly constructed as ""Babel"". Where ""21 Grams"" also had a muddled, jumbled narrative, the characters were given raw complexity, but not as much emotional weight as the characters are given in ""Babel"". Its safe to say ""Babel"" is the crowning work in the trilogy.Using the same narrative structure used in ""Amores Perros"", and ""21 Grams"", which both films were influenced by the nonlinear strategy of ""Pulp Fiction"", these are interlocking stories, where the parallel editing is not in simultaneous action. The use of this structure at times comes off a little too stylistic in other films, however Arriago always deftly uses the overlapping structure that never undermines the material.With four interlocking stories, in four different settings that include Mexico, Morocco, Japan, and southern California, all the stories have rhythms of tragedy, loss, miscommunication, and redemption. The first tragedy occurs, where two Moroccan boys fire a shot at a bus, that leads to a World-Wide tragic of an American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) that are traveling to Morocco. The other is about a Mexican Nanny, the third story is a Japanese father and rebellious daughter in Tokyo.All these characters fit in the theme of loss, that is both physical and emotional. All these tragedies are heightened by the lack of understanding and miscommunication in a post 9/11 world. The title is a reference to a biblical term that indicates the difficulties of understanding languages.Ambitiously shot in the real settings of countries that include Mexico, Japan, and Morroco, and using the native languages, ""Babel"" brilliantly establishes the failure of human communication and connection. The characters in ""Babel"" are trapped and lost in their own isolated worlds of despair. The specifics in the film illuminate this, take for example the first tale of Richard and Susan, they are in Morocco, they are isolated, emotionally and physically in a far Third-World country.It's revealed in the film that they have recently experienced the lost of one of their children, in a tragedy that both characters hold responsible for each other. They haven't recovered from the tragedy yet, there is a sense there is a lack of intimacy and chemistry between the two, and its noticeable in a striking and equally affecting scene where Susan is suffering from her bullet wound, and she needs to go the bathroom and Richard gets her a pan, and their interaction hints at something that has been missing since the tragedy. This section of the film is the most raw, gripping, and shattering one of the three.The second tale is probably the most absorbing one of the three. Its revealed Amelia is an illegal immigrant nanny for Richard and Susan in San Diego. She's in dire need to attend her son's wedding in Mexico, and travels back to Mexico with her irresponsible nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), she illegally sneaks the kids across the border to the wedding. On the way back home, they are interrogated by border men. The incident leads an escape, to Amelia and the kids being stranded in the desert.This story is probably the most personal for both Innaritu and Arriago. This tale is the parable of the three, to capture how hypocritical and arbitrary the border policy are in both the Mexican and American governments. Its revealed that Amelia was a working in America for 10 years, that raised children of an embassy official, and she is given no regard in either country.The third story, which is the most literal, is where the rich nuances are. Its about a Japanese father (Koji Yokusho) trying to reach out emotionally to his deaf daughter Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi). Chiecko is shattered by the suicide of her mother, and she endures desperate heights in trying to reach out for affection and understanding. This is the story where some will dismiss ""Babel"" as being manipulative or unconvincing, especially the way this story is linked to the Morroco narrative, however this is where the rich and honest pathos lies.There is an astonishing disco scene where we get the point-of-view and reaction shots Chieko inside a dance club, where sound goes in and out as we get a glimpse of what Chiecko is experiencing. Kikuchi captures every nuance and vulnerability in this role, just look at how fragile the scene is when she stands naked on the balcony in her own isolated world of Tokyo.Essentially, ""Babel"" is a beautiful, and equally shattering portrait of a world in crises. ""Babel"" is galvanizing, and will internally stay inside the memories of cinephiles, its so unforgettable.Rating **** out of ****",Babel
397,ikonoklastik,Not bad.,7,17 November 2006,"I thought it was a solid movie but not brilliant. Directing-wise it was really great. But something was missing.I think the movie was trying to tell too many stories at once and didn't give you the chance to form an emotional investment or intellectual conclusion in either one. It felt like it was trying to get us to understand something but stopped short of providing us with everything that would be necessary to achieve that understanding. I accept the possibility that it may just be giving us a snapshot, a scenario for its own sake, without the intention of conveying a message -- which is fine -- but what is important is that it felt like it was trying to convey something. Especially with a title like ""Babel"". And I just didn't connect. This concept would have been much better as a three film series a la Kieslowski's ""Trois couleurs"" series because there was so much depth left unexplored.I was left wondering a lot about the characters because it seemed like it was putting more thematic importance on the motivations of the characters than the actual occurrences yet a lot of those motivations were only hinted. And there should have been far more of Kôji Yakusho because he kicks ass. It really did look great, though, and there was some top-notch acting, even from the children. I hope it at least leads Americans to reconsider their overly general and unfair opinion of Muslims.",Babel
398,MattD12027,The Quintessence of Intensity,8,12 November 2006,"I was unprepared for the emotional intensity of this film, and it was better for it. Please, try and see this film with as little pretense as possible, because the visceral impact of the pain and hope on the screen before you will be magnified because of it. Inarritu, perhaps one of the most interesting visual storytellers of the past few decades, goes beyond anything we have seen from him to date. Babel is the outstanding example of emotion, the raw feelings that drive all human beings--love, anger, humiliation, sadness, pain...I'm purposely leaving any talk of the plot out of this review because I don't want to ruin ANY of the multitude of nuances Inarritu has in this story...suffice it to say that time coalesces in this movie, and something that happens near the beginning plays out again near the end, although from a different perspective. And I'm giving this an 8/10 because I feel that there is more potential here. Given another thirty minutes, minus the constraints of the MPAA, I think Babel could be a masterpiece. Summarily, Babel is the quintessence of intensity, and you would have to be inhuman to be unmoved by its content.",Babel
399,dougjn,Greatly overrated for quasi political reasons; Japanese segment excellent and by far best,4,9 March 2008,"Greatly overrated film by the Woody Allen set, et.al. (I like/love many Woody Allen films btw.) First of all it's slow paced, and not visually or intellectually / dialogue rich enough to justify that, in either of which case I'm often a very happy camper.But next I just have to get to it's utterly self absorbed politicized mindset, as opposed to e.g. really getting deeply into individual charters as lived in an individual culture. Yeah there's some of the later, but a lot of the former. The MESSAGE is 1) we are all connected, even from far away, much more closely than you think, six degrees of separation taken international yada yada yada (but it's basically bs); 2) the US is way too hung up on terrorism and that wasn't what was behind the crime / recklessness gone way wrong at all; 3) to return to 1 in another guise, we are all one, kumbaya, kumbaya.There are three segments to this film, which are inter-cut and increasingly and sometimes surprisingly interwoven. The surprises are actually the chief thing that recommends this film, and I won't reveal them. The Japanese one, which has by far the least air time, is also by far the best. Actually, this part expanded would have made one hell of a good movie. It does have a surprising plot connection to the rest of the film, but it's otherwise just about completely disconnected and separate (and better) in profundity of concerns, style, and even execution and economy. These segments never dawdle. Oh, and the lead actress here, and yeah her friend too, is hot - and very sympathetic. This is actually one of the best modern themed and set Japanese film segments I've seen.The Moroccan one, which seems dominant but which may be equal or only slightly ahead in air time compared to the SoCal/Mexico one, is intermediate in quality and interest. It's decent, and has a bit (but not so much really) interesting local Moroccan color, but it's way too slow, and well just dull. The SoCal / Mexican segment is just dreck, heavily messaged with anti immigration law enforcement message, and cultural embarrassing messages. In fact the illegal Mexican immigrant nanny makes utterly appalling decisions, though yes under the pressure of the ethically worse (but more successful) decisions of her nephew, whom she continues to embrace despite all (disgustingly to me and my moral universe), and in fact criminal ones: such as, leaving aside immigration issues, child endangerment, criminal neglect (yeah she had a duty and position of trust, until she resigned), and the like.I watched this film because of it's ratings and the buzz, though I expected I'd probably be disappointed. I was, massively. Would I recommend you viewing it? Not unless you watch one hell of a lot of movies (which I do), and then, well, judge for yourself after reading my review.",Babel

401,Andy-Denotti,A web of human drama,9,28 October 2007,"Babel is a powerful story told with superb direction and editing.It is not a movie for everyone though: especially if you like a straightforward one-way story with a main character and a happy ending. You'll be rewarded though if you can look a little deeper at the multiple layers the director and actors want to show us.Several stories alternate and interlace where human drama is the main focus. The beautiful music is subtly tuned to the storytelling.The further into the movie you go the more dramatically the different stories connect and intertwine and the more emotional your connection with the character's plight becomes. The closer you look the more mesmerizing the journey becomes.Just when you are on the edge of your seat, absorbed into the drama of one story, you are abruptly but skilfully thrown back into the drama of the other story, into another person's life, in another country and in another moment in time. And yet they all tell a different part of the same story, where people's decisions have far reaching consequences.In spite of the construction, the movie is never too complex or too fast and is a joy to watch. Japan, Mexico, Morocco. No matter how far apart and how different in culture, people's lives intertwine and influence each other, and ultimately are brought together by their humanity.Babel is one of those movies that tell a story about regular people in such a way that at the end you are connected to the characters, and it leaves you thinking about them and their stories even after the credits.",Babel

Personally, I thought that it was a horrible film.All of the characters do stupid things and get into trouble all by themselves, irrespective of nationality or race. It's then up to the police, border guards, etc. to get them out of their predicaments.There are three main story lines. They are so loosely intertwined that you spend most of the time shaking your head wondering how one story is related to the other. The dark scenes are excruciatingly long. I'm not sure if the director thinks that his audience is brain dead, but I was left talking back to the TV saying ""okay, I get it, move on..."" during numerous scenes, and I am a relatively patient guy.In many ways it was well shot and could have been an interesting movie.

Nations separated by power, humans separated by color and customs, preference of a mate based on wholeness, the loose use of the word terrorism and a single folly, interconnected into a maze of reality.

The clues include her saying to her team-mate that she would 'fuck her dad', her coming on to the much older policeman, and the circumstances of her mother's death, which could have been a reaction to finding out about the abuse; and finally, the rather equivocal last scene between Cheiko and her father. And what did she write in the note to the policeman? Her behaviour could be attributed simply to her feelings of isolation as a deaf-mute girl trying to deal with her sexuality and being depressed by the rebuffs she receives, but it could come from something more sinister. This film is very much about children and the terrible things that can happen to them (note that the director dedicates it to his own children) so this theory could be correct in the very bleak context of the film as a whole.",Babel
406,LTCRKeats,The sheer ugliness and nastiness of life.,2,8 December 2006,"I have only walked out on two movies in my entire life. One was in 1983 and the other was yesterday when I went to see Babel. I almost asked for my money back. The movie is well acted and well directed with interesting scenery, but it is a long and tedious movie that is simply terrible.Briefly the story has four separate but related parts/stories: The first two involve American parents in a troubled marriage who take a long vacation in North Africa and leave their very young children with an undocumented baby sitter who ends up having to take the kids to Mexico so she can attend her son's wedding. She is caught trying to return, can't come back and the kids are dumped and almost die. The baby sitter tries, but... The wife gets shot and almost killed on the vacation. She is basically saved by an Arab veterinarian who acts as a doctor. A sub plot is the other tourists on the bus are so worried about their own schedules and convenience they refuse to even try to help the poor stranger who was shot and is clearly near death. They are little more than an obnoxious mob.The third is about an African/Arab family who buy a gun. One son has almost an incestuous relationship with his sister and ends up masturbating on the screen. Later, just for the fun of it, he ends up shooting the American wife as they travel down a back road in a bus.The fourth story line is a deaf Japanese girl who is disturbed over her mother's suicide. She pulls a Britney Spears in a teen hangout and exposes herself to a group of total strangers (teen aged boys). Later at her Dentist she tries to french kiss him and then grabs his hand and pushes it up her skirt. The embarrassed Dentist throws her out.I knew it would all be tied together at the end. But the movie was so boring, depressing and slow moving, I decided the value of seeing the end did not match the ugliness of tolerating this bad of a movie. You have to have standards and this simply fell below them.",Babel

408,twistedhooch,"A bit of a critically acclaimed misfire, if you ask me.",5,19 March 2007,"Babel, the recent film by Alejandro González Iñárritu (director of the fantastic Amores Perros and 21 Grams) is the kind of film that will divide people into two categories  those who find it intellectually stimulating, and those who find it worthy and dull. Structured in the style of his prior works, Iñárritu here weaves a four connected tales from around the globe about how language divides people, and only half succeeds this time  the narrative device no longer feels fresh and innovative here, but quite superfluous and mishandled. Babel's message that people need to listen is ultimately stating the obvious for a high-brow but conservative cinema-goer (read: those who use the Oscars / Oscar nominations as a gauge of cinematic success), adding no new insight here to the topic.Babel has a few things going for it, such as the wonderful acting of Gael Garcia Bernal and Adriana Barraza in the most likable of the four stories, the Mexican wedding. There is some beautiful cinematography  the dusty Mexico, the dry Moroccan desert, and vibrant Tokyo settings lending their charms to the hand-held style. A scene of Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi, who puts in a good performance despite her story) in the nightclub beautifully juxtaposes the noise-filled third-person perspective and her silent first-person perspective is very poignant. The bleak tone is well maintained over the course of the film, right up to the well-directed but telegraphed climax.Babel's two-and-a-half hour running time does drag - the numerous scenes of Susan (Cate Blanchett) slowly dying in a Moroccan village could have been cut down somewhat. The story of the deaf girl Chieko and her alienation from the rest of the hyper-real and loud Japanese society is at times embarrassing - the crude treatment of Chieko trying validate herself by sleeping with someone, in particular. The Tokyo story is interwoven into the film by a very tenuous link and feels forced in for the sake of the structure, rather than actually benefiting the story.I know the above opinion is not the popular consensus on this site, but it is my opinion that Babel was a hyped affair that failed to convince. If you liked last years Syriana then you may find some stuff here to enjoy, similar as both films are in structure and tone, but I'd personally advice you to check out Amores Perros before braving Babel.",Babel
409,scaves,How could 'The Onion' drop the ball on this one so badly?,10,19 November 2006,"I'm not sure this post contains spoilers or not, but I'll check the box anyway.Babel is a strong candidate for an Oscar, and I hope it sweeps up a lot of them. Crash (to which Babel is frequently compared) was interesting, but I test the impact a movie had on me by how urgently I need to see it again. I can hardly remember Crash, but Babel sticks with me because of its breath-taking imagery, its splendid and subtle character development, its fine acting, its examination of the small mistakes that have large and even unknown repercussions across the globe, and its savvy use of a Biblical icon: the Tower of Babel where God confounded the nations and their languages because of human presumption.But it's not the mis-communications between cultures that is so expertly examined in this film: rather it is the mis-communications between people who presumably speak the *same* language. Cross-culturally, people connect beautifully: the Japanese hunter and the Moroccan goatherder; the kind Moroccan villager and the medicine woman who get help for the injured American woman; the Mexican nanny who loves the American children she has tended all her life. Those who don't connect are the husband and wife over the escape they've made to Morocco; the preoccupied Japanese father is unable to understand the emotional isolation of his deaf daughter; the Mexican nanny is helpless at the hands of her irresponsible nephew; the Moroccan father carelessly gives the purchased rifle to his young sons. Here is where the true ""babel"" exists, within families where children are hurt by the careless mistakes of their caregivers.Given all this, I cannot understand how reviewer N. M. of ""The Onion"" could make such a thoughtless assessment of the Japanese daughter in his on-line review (go to ""external reviews""). It seems as though her pathological behavior hit such an irritated moral nerve in him that it blunted his understanding of the film. He writes that the story of the ""surly Tokyo deaf-mute"" in her ""desperate attempt to lose her virginity doesn't end until she's thoroughly humiliated herself."" Then he adds: ""and this proves how hard it is for us to communicate with each other. . .how?"" Hello????? First, it's not her virginity that she's trying to lose. It's an emotional starvation she's trying to feed that she associates naively with sex. Her father can't see it, and her need for connection becomes so urgent that she becomes monstrous to the men who reject her. Her deafness cuts her off even further from human contact in the most obvious way.Just what does Murray need to have explained here? Further, her desperate attempts do NOT end until she's thoroughly humiliated. They end with something else that anyone who has seen the film through to its conclusion can pick up on. Murray must have fallen asleep during the film, or not be aware, on some inexplicable level, what language barriers the hearing-impaired face every day in a world of sound. And how in so many other ways we are deaf to those closest to us.A lesson here: not every review, including mine, is your best guide. Go see the movie. If it speaks to you it speaks to you.",Babel
410,fonzactim,This was the worst movie I think I ever...,1,17 November 2006,"*** Oh so many spoilers *** Yeah. Hated it.Okay. Maybe I have seen worse but after walking out of this, I couldn't think of one. I like the comment earlier that this movie was a non-linear mess. What exactly was this movie about? The best I can come up with is:1.) Don't try to cross the US/Mexican border with your drunk a** nephew driving the car. 2.) Don't give young Moroccan kids a gun to play with cuz it could go really really bad. 3.) Don't commit suicide. It could really jack your deaf/mute daughters head up and she doesn't need anymore problems.All of these happenings were very loosely related. Unlike, Traffic or Crash that also had multiple connected story lines, this one failed to be compelling, come together at any point or convey a strong message about anything. It was just pointless with so many very pointless scenes one after another and another. Exactly at what point did we need to see a 12 year old boy masturbating behind a rock? I ask you, exactly what did that bring to the story or the character? It contributed nothing. It was just weird. Exactly why was the Asian girl so desperate for love that she attempted to molest the dentist? What does that have to do with anything exactly? Am I really to believe that she was so distraught over her mothers suicide the prior year and her own deaf/muteness that it turned her to sexual desperation? She tried really really hard, folks. Look, I'm no prude or anything, I like gratuitous sex the same as the next person but I'd like there to be some kind of reason that fits to the story...just because I'm odd that way. In this case there was no real story so I guess one could just throw in unreasonably weird scenes wherever they so choose, who cares, why not, when it's this bad it can get a whole lot worse...What any of it had to do with the failure to communicate, I have no idea. It's completely wasted on me.Don't even bother renting this one. Really, it's that bad.",Babel
411,ts_nowhere,Less would have been more.,2,11 February 2007,"The movie shows several short stories in different cultures, that are somewhat intertwined. This idea has a lot of appeal and creates some interesting contrasts. The main story about 2 boys shooting at a tourist bus, sets off events that will effect all people in the movie. It is also the most interesting one of the plots. Unfortunately from then on, the movies pretentiousness got the better of it: The other stories are boring, pointless and often incredibly unbelievable. The connection between them is minor, and has no actual impact, which wastes the potential of the idea. One story is about a Japanese deaf girl, that is sexually frustrated... this message gets repeated and repeated and repeated. There is not point, no twist, no story. This girl, like nearly everyone in the movie, acts very incomprehensible, which makes it hard to identify with her. Thats why the viewer can't really feel with the people. So after one hour, one only waits if something unexpected will happen, so that the movie stays interesting. Unfortunately the fight to stay though the rest does not pay off. It is just elongated scenes that desperately try to create some emotions. That is for me the major downfall of this piece: it tries to be emotional, but to achieve this, it uses unbelievable behavior and even plot holes, just to have someone cry. That is in my eyes artsy for the sake of being artsy.",Babel
412,yelenakaplun,Liked Amores Perros much better,8,13 April 2007,"My husband and I watched Babel on DVD and it was much easier to digest in its 3 hrs running time. I did not find much of a message there, stories did not really connect and brilliant actors like Bernal and Blanchette were not given a lot to do. We happened to watch Amores Perros quite recently and I liked its authenticity and pacing much better. I had hard time believing in some of the story lines: I did not feel that tourists on the bus can be so heartless as they were portrayed; illegal Mexican immigrant decided to go easily back to Mexico without a fear of not being able to come back; Japanese hunter in Morocco - the desert landscape there did not seem much of a hunting playground (but truthfully I'm not an expert on this). Yet, ""Babel"" is a sort of a movie that makes you think, ask questions, connect the dots and wonder what the creators meant by placing the stories in 3 different parts of the world: Far East,Middle East and American West. Maybe stories even occurred in the same geographical parallel . You wonder, what does it mean that Japanese girl mother shot herself and does it have anything to do with her husband's rifle. And finally, what does the movie title really mean?",Babel
413,claygoul-1,Engrossingly Great Story Telling,10,19 October 2006,"Alejando Gonzalez Inarritu has remarkable vision. I find that one viewing of any of his two previous films is not enough to take in all of the overreaching extension of plot and the fascinating way in which the stories, although separate set pieces, are actually part of a complex design that use leit-motifs which integrate time and space and provide for satisfying the audience's intelligence while not cheating on that audience's emotional needs. And so I here confess to seeing ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams"" many times each, with ""21 Grams"" hitting some very powerful emotions in me and which I consider to be one of the most powerful experiences I've ever had in movies.And so with ""Babel,"" which I have just returned from seeing at The New Orleans Film Festival, it is impossible to take in all of the director's vision on one viewing, but, yet, I say that this film is easier to access than are the two previous films. One viewing of it hasn't displaced my love and affection for ""21 Grams,"" and I truly look forward to at least another big screen viewing before I one day own a DVD copy of it.There is little that I can fault with the movie, with the possible exception of it's length. But then, one viewing, again, is impossible to fairly argue on the point of length. The audience was captivated and responded with appropriate revulsion during a scene in Mexico with chickens. Is it possible that we feel more for the killing of animals than we do of humans? The acting of Mr. Pitt, Miss Blanchett and Mr. Bernal, the universally known screen stars in the movie is impeccable and seamless. There are so many other outstanding performances from so many actors and actresses that a true ensemble has been achieved from many non-professional actors. I found the work of the children, Moroccan, American and Japanese to be outstanding. If Mr. Inarritu can be praised for anything in this film, it can be for eliciting the great performances from those young people. Outstanding.The film is visually stunning and the music is quite beautiful. I recommend this movie to any of the fans of Mr. Inarritu, but then, I'm sure that I don't have to recommend it to them; they can't wait to see it and marvel at this great artist's vision and deep sense of compassion for us fellow humans. I am convinced that Mr. Inarritu is a great fellow human being.",Babel

The shaky way of filming some scenes is an even more annoying attempt at creating a film-house atmosphere for this 'movie'.The surprises the plot brings are of no real connection to the storyline or the continuance of the movie.

417,IAAL,This is a Best Picture nominee?,4,23 February 2007,"Nice visuals, killer score, some great (if kind of show-offy) editing -- but I'm with the ""What in God's name was that supposed to be about?"" crowd. Sorry, but when I see a bunch of different stories, set on different continents in different languages, I don't think it's unreasonable of me to think that I'm being invited to find the common thread. When it turns out that there isn't one, it's like the filmmakers are pointing at me and laughing and saying ""Ha ha, gotcha!"" It's like Lucy pulling the football away when Charlie Brown goes to kick it. They raised my expectations, completely frustrated them, and apparently expected to get a medal for it (or perhaps a gold statuette).These three stories (or four, I guess, if you count the Morocco sequence as two separate ones) were all interesting, but their points of connection were completely irrelevant to the stories themselves. They could just as well have thrown in one about the guy who's in charge of the computer network at the Winchester factory where the rifle was made (and his dysfunctional relationship with his adopted Vietnamese daughter, perhaps), or the clerk in the African gun shop where the Japanese guy bought the rifle while on safari (and his struggle to come to terms with his homosexuality in the age of AIDS). I could make up a million of these. It's sort of cool that they did the multiple-intersecting-stories thing, but there needs to be a payoff, a resolution, a closure -- a reason I wasted 140-odd minutes of my life watching this thing. There wasn't.I was pretty surprised at ""Little Miss Sunshine"" getting a best-pic nomination, but it was better than this. At least it was about something.",Babel
418,socrates_note,Loved it.,10,25 June 2006,"Starting from the arid planes of Morrocco, to the lull of American suburbia and into the manic pop culture of Japan - Babel is the third offering from the director of Amorres Perros and 21 Grams. For me, it sits with his first feature in tone, emotion, grit and performance. The tri-secting story telling, the visual panorama and characters pull you in to a world forgetting that you are in a cinema and that it sits packed with no standing room either. Babel was a film that deserved its place in the Official competition just as the it deserved best director. yet, could not help but think that it soared high above its competition and deserved Cannes ultimate accolade.",Babel

To be honest, when I watched the starting scenes of the movie, I said, ""this is another anti-Asian, anti-Islamic movie supported by Pentagon. But thinking more, and finding out the theme of the story was a ""lack of communication"", I got to love it. But I feel that there should have been a scene in, for instance, New York City wherein there is violence and lack of communication just as there is all over the world. This could show that the director is not racist at all! By the way, the whole movie was a nice job. I sympathized with all of the characters, mostly Yussef's and Ahmad's father, but not for Santiago, the rascal Mexican. I recommend to all intellectuals to watch this movie with a broad mind.",Babel
420,barker_dl,One of the Best multi-story Movies,10,16 August 2015,"Before watching Babel I had only seen one other movie where you follow multiple story lines and see how they intersect, so you could say this was fresh to me when I watched this movie.What makes this movie so great is that each story line has a LOT of drama to it and you learn enough about the scenario and characters that it pulls you in to each story. I read another review where the central story lines, the one with Brad Pitt doesn't allow Cate Blanchett to be involved much. Well, yeah because that's the story line. To me if she were more involved it would have been forced and would have ruined it. Brad Pitt did a fantastic job. Some have said he's a little stoic, or emotionless or words to that effect, in various movies but here he does well. News flash. Many men are stoic or emotionless on the outside. To me, that's one of the things that makes him great. There is enough emotion or outward expression from him, in every single movie of his I have seen, that makes those movies real. It's why he's been in so many great movies. It's partly because of him. Their story line is once again the central story line, as all the others have an effect on theirs.If you enjoy drama this movie will most likely pull you in completely and it will be a wonderful 2 hours and 20 minutes. I've watched it a few times and I am a mix between action and drama kind of guy. In a way this movie comes close to being an action movie in each story line as the drama gets pretty intense. Guess that's why it's been in my player more than once.I said it's one of the best multi-story movies. Honestly the way I feel is it's at the top and any other great multi-story movie is simply sharing space at the top with Babel.Dim the light and get out the popcorn.",Babel

Every scene, every shot, every reaction by the wonderful cast, every carefully picked piece of music accompanying the scenes.

423,tex_a_2000,This tried to be like Crash but crashed,6,1 December 2006,"I just came from watching this 2 hr marathon of a film called ""Babel"" and I must say that it indeed lives up to its name. So much so that the whole theatre just left in silence as a very cliché 2 hr flick passed right before their very eyes. I have seen many others give this film an extremely high rating such as 8 and 9 out of 10, but really i must ask on what do they rate a flick....the actor??? the plot???? special effects????? honestly I'm lost on this one. For me I use two things...1) If the film was entertaining and 2) the way the message was put across and obviously that forces me to make a comparison between other movies of the same genre movies. Now, for those that gave this movie 8+ I must ask them what rating they gave Crash....Crash was times better in terms of plot, suspense, projection, character building and the way in which everything was tied together in the end. I really bonded with the majority of the characters in Crash, however in Babel there was really no great building of any particular character persay, making it hard to feel empathy for their situations as the film began to unfold. There were many scenes that made little or no sense example...the boy masturbating...i mean if they had a discussion about the girl that could have evoked sensual emotions then i could understand, but instead they go from shooting, to quareling then to masturbation????? and another example was when the deaf girl went to the club and started partying...that was an extremely long scene, probably nearly 4 mins and in the end all that happened was that a guy she liked kissed another girl????? it was a complete waste of time as an event such as that could have been summed up in less than 60 secs of film. In the end of the picture no one even knew what the girl told the cop...unless of course you speak and read the language that was spoken.On a whole the picture wasn't the worst, but i would put it on par with American Gun and not a picture that got best picture of the year like Crash. This rating on IMDb is probably because people love Brad Pitt, but the rating here is definitely too high by all logical parameters. It deserves 6/10....and if you doubt this please watch it for yourself.",Babel

But that still was one of the parts that was pretty good to watch, gives you a good idea of how it is to be deaf.This is a great movie to watch in cinema, or see it on TV once. But it is not a movie that you wan't to see more than once. Which I usually DO have with movies I enjoy (most DVD's I buy are from movies I have already seen once or twice)So, if it is on TV once, go see it. Or you can rent it.

426,vindana,"The Name ""Babel"" and its meaning",8,20 May 2008,"In Gen. 11:9, the name of Babel is etymologized by association with the Hebrew verb balal, ""to confuse or confound"": Balal is regarded as a contraction of earlier *balbal. The name bab-ilu in Akkadian means ""gate of god"" (from bab ""gate"" + ilu ""god""). The word bab-el can also be seen to mean ""gate of god"" (from bab ""gate"" + el ""god"").Babel is mentioned in Genesis 10:10 as the home city of Nimrod: [10] And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel (Persia), and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. [11] Out of that land went forth Asshur, and build Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, [12] And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. (KJV) According to Genesis 11:19, humankind, after the deluge, traveled from the mountain where the ark had rested, and settled in ""a plain in the land of Shinar."" Here, they attempted to build a city and a tower whose top would be in the Heavens, the Tower of Babel.The attempt to build the city of Babel with its tower, caused God to respond.

To me the film was a complete spin off of Paul Haggis's ""Crash"". Crash was a great film, but this film seems to have the same ideas but did not present them as well as Haggis did. I did find some parts interesting but other parts seemed to be just random actions from the characters for no apparent reason. The film was addicting because once you start watching you can't stop till its over, but it was a complete disappointment. If you saw this film and did find it entertaining, I would strongly suggest ""Crash"" which has a better but similar storyline and beautiful work from everyone in the project.",Babel
429,RottenMoreno,"A powerful, moving and emotional film",9,11 November 2006,"""Babel"", like ""21 Grams"" tells the stories of different people whose lives interlace as the movie goes forward. This time, it's caused by two Moroccan boys accidentally shoot a bus and hit an American tourist.This last work from Iñarritú looks a lot like ""21 Grams"" in so many ways, specially the soundtrack, which is almost the same, and gives a sad atmosphere to the film. But this time, the stories don't interlace as well you might expect and some loose ends remain, when at some parts of the movie it leaves you hanging, just were it starts getting more interesting.The most remarkable thing from the film is definitely the acting, which was Oscar worthy, specially from Adriana Barraza and the Moroccan boys, who in my opinion were fantastic. Also Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett bring us powerful performances that shine on screen on every scene of the movie. New star Rinko Kikuchi, also delivers an impressive performance as the disturbed young character. Gael García Bernal also makes a great job, even do he doesn't get a lot of screen time.But my big complain from the film was the lack of dramatic scenes, because you feel sad during the whole film, but every time you were at the edge of your seat on a story, they change to another one in a glimpse, which gets you out of your mood. The most powerful story for me was the one with the nanny (Adriana Barraza) and the American kids, closely followed by the Moroccan boys story. And my least favorite, the Japanese one, which wasn't bad, but didn't reached the level of interest as the other 3 stories did. As a result, Babel is a very powerful movie that shocks, entertains and saddens the audience, but lacks in effectiveness and closure. Some of the best performances of the year are here, and to see that, you have to watch this movie, that is also, one of the best films of the year.",Babel

431,rafasalin,Is that Babel? The meaninglessness of four stories with a loose connections.,5,7 January 2007,"Is that Babel? The meaninglessness of four stories with a loose connections.Rafael J. Salin-PascualBabel (Dir. Alejandro Gonzales Iñarritu, 2006).Short stories, novels and scripts should be perfect lies, that is more or less what Mario Vargas Llosa said once. The public must have some rules or premises that should support how strong the story is. So the four dramas that puzzle ""Babel"" are so bad supported, but without cause. The rifle is in Guiilermo Arriaga and Alejandro Iñurriti minds, the natural connection of the four stories. But is so week the way that this link is made that soundly all the magic or a good craftsman (As Iñarritu has shown to be) is evaporated. Some examples of how light are the stories are presented.Some very bad equipped morocco policemen found the bullet cases, close to the area in which a bullet strikes an American tourist Susan (Blanchett). So in last than some hours or almost immediately, they new who was the owner of the rifle, that this rifle was a present of a japans hunter and almost all about that rifle?The peasant is localized and with brutality is apprehended by theirs own policeman (Isn't that another contradiction of the message that the director and screen written want to show? Arabs or people in the world are nice except police)The rifle is also the connection with a japans family of a father and a daughter who live in Tokyo, her name is Chieko (She is deaf ad mute), also suffering from a depression after her mother committed suicide, but at the same time is horny all the time and by all means she try to attracted boys (for instance removing her panties in a public restaurant) and later the police young man attention, and within a few hours she summons Mitsu (played by Yuko Murata), a police officer with whom she intends to have sex. Soon after he arrives at her apartment, she strips, hoping for sex. It very improbable that a person in grief reaction present this manifestation, but even if that happen is more difficult that in a medicals society as Tokyo the relatives of this girl did not notice the bizarre behavior and put her under medical supervision. Related to ""the accident"" of two peasant boy shooting vehicles, that would be believed if these two kids were mental retarded, or with some kind of behavioral disorders, there are not premise that support that this two guys just shoot vehicles just for scientific purposes (to demonstrate if the bullets travel 3 kilometers). If the idea of those story was to demonstrate that Arabs are nice and gentle people but stupid, or because they are stupid they must be nice, was aberrant. Four hours from the nearest hospital, the coach takes a detour to a remote village where a local man offers shelter while the other tourists argue over whether to stay or leave. The way that the character are presented are so light that if the film is watched twice, now without the impact of some of the scenes, you will be laughing of the coarse arguments.The same happens with Amelia's personality, which is presented first as very assertive, but later on as foolish that is not capable to react with the border patrol, or to leave the small kids in the desert. The run away of Gael García from the Border Patrol is one of the must naive scenes. How can a automobile could be lost when is followed by helicopters and vans equipped with radar, infrared vision equipment and so on. That only could happen if Harry Potter was a friend of one of the kids that are with Amelia.So at the end all the connections are like a gigantic delusion in Iñurritu's mind. The main problem with this movie is that his director wants to remark the movie as the example of human incommunicado (As Biblical Babel). But it is full with double messages. The Arabs are good people but silly; the Mexicans cheerful but choleric and always try to runaway, but also foolish; Japanese have a form of bereavement reaction with sex in an insistent way and the Americans ""Gringos"", they are the bad guys of the story, because they deport Amelia that could be the heroine of the movie, or that they don't know how to keep the calm when an ambulance doesn't arrive to a village of Morocco. This is the formula that many directors believe that it works as synonym of protest cinema, to hit to the Empire. Will this be the reason for which the French gave it the prize in Cannes? The movie at the end is a lot of noise and few nuts.",Babel
432,Kalamata,Engaging but ultimately unsatisfying,4,8 January 2007,"Director Iñárritu's overreaching all but destroys this film; his cluttered vision is too trammeled up with a casual, clichéd anti-Americanism and an inability to connect too many dots in order to prove his point. Otherwise, what we have is a beautifully shot (Roderigo Prieto deserves an Oscar for his astonishing and involving work) film taking place in three places simultaneously. Each place has its own palette (Prieto again) and its own feel thanks to José Antonio García's award-deserving sound mixing and Gustavo Santaolalla's inimitably sensitive score. The acting is worthy if unremarkable, all actors  particularly Said Tarchani as ""Ahmed"" - doing quite competent work. The most complete, satisfying story takes place in Japan (whose connection to the other stories is tenuous at best). It offers a unique, fascinating, and oddly touching glimpse into a part of Japanese life rarely visited in American or even Asian cinema. I strove to like this movie more, but I simply found the entire Mexico sequence so far-fetched that it strained credulity. This large and dominant section was a good example of a director forcing a story to comply with his ideas regardless of the consequences to the clarity and meaning of the film. Still, it is, in my opinion, a far better film than Crash, to which it has been lazily and inaccurately, I think, compared. 9 stars for craft, 5 for story.",Babel

434,eibeh007,Another superb work by Inarritu,8,20 May 2007,"'Babel' is a fascinating study of communication barriers, universal politics, cultural diversity and existential loneliness. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made two complex and thought-provoking films(""21 grams"" and Amores Perros"") but his latest masterpiece, 'Babel', is probably the most heartbreaking and haunting yet. Of course, the credit also goes to screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto(a frequent collaborator of Inarritu's) for their clarity of vision and creativity. You either get this film or you miss the boat on it entirely, there's no in-between. I can tell you one thing though, its one of the very best Hollywood films of last year. A truly powerful and brilliant film that stays with you long after it has concluded. The film is set in four countries: Morocco, United states, Mexico and Japan. And its really amazing how Inarritu masterfully leaps from one story to another building up to a powerful climax.There are basically four intersecting story lines in the film, and they're connected but not precisely in a synchronized fashion. It feels like you're going back and forth through chapters of a book. Brad Pitt (in his best performance in years) and Cate Blanchett(outstanding, as usual) play Richard and Susan, respectively. Richard and Susan are grief-stricken American couple from San Diego, California, who decide to take a trip to Morocco to find some piece of mind after tragically losing their youngest child. They leave their older children(played by Ellen Fanning and Nathan Gamble)in the care of their Mexican maid, Amelia(a brilliant Adriana Barraza).Unbeknownst to them, Amelia takes the children, without permission, to her native Mexico to attend her only son's wedding. The driver happens to be Amelia's alcoholic, abrasive illegal immigrant nephew, Santiago(played by Gael Garcia Bernal). On their re-entry into the United States, they're stopped by a border patrol officer(the criminally underrated Clifton Collins, Jr). Seeing two White kids at the backseat, the patrol officer grows increasingly suspicious and orders them out of the car. Santiago panics, takes off and it results in a terrifying car chase into the night.One of the key segments features a Moroccan goat herder who lives on the hillside with his two wayward young sons. When the Moroccan goat herder carelessly hands a rifle to his young sons(the intent was to keep jackals away from the livestock), the kids use an approaching tourist bus as target practice instead. As they test their rifle by firing at the tourist bus, a stray bullet accidentally hits Richard's wife on the shoulder. The incident triggers a ripple effect that transcends the African nation. The U.S. government mistake it as an act of terrorism. The Moroccan authorities start investigation; eventually, they learn that the goat herding family residing on the hillside are the culprits. They also learn who sold the goat herder the rifle used in the shooting, a Japanese businessman(Koji Yakusho).The story jumps to Tokyo, Japan. The businessman has a deaf-mute teenager daughter named Cheiko(Rinko Kikuchi, in a stunning, show-stealing performance). Its very obvious that this is a girl in great deal of emotional pain. Her mother committed suicide and the father is emotionally distant, so she rebels against him by being promiscuous with strange boys, throwing herself at a detective, boozing and partying hard at nightclubs. All she wants is to feel close to someone, anyone, even if that means compromising her dignity in the process. Her loneliness is very palpable. you can't help but feel heartbreak as soon as she walks inside a nightclub brimming with life. The director takes you into her lonely world but frequently muting the loud noise from the nightclub. I feel tremendous sympathy for deaf-mutes. How do they manage to live a life of complete silence? I can't imagine not hearing voices, sounds of nature, music, etc. When words fail, what are the ramifications?. Watch 'Babel' to find out. Excellent film!",Babel
435,airjimmyshoes,"Look up ""ANTI-CLIMACTIC"" and you should see Babel's poster",5,4 February 2007,"I give this movie a very, very weak five stars. This is the MOST complex movie I've seen in my 14 years of life. I do tend to get complex movies about how people's lives can intertwine together (i.e. CRASH), but BABEL is just outrageous. The reason I give it 5 stars is: 1) It deserves a 4.6, 4.7, or 4.8, but I could only get a five 2) It would be WAY worse if Brad Pitt wasn't in it. I don't like him off the screen, but on the screen, he has been in two of my favorite movies (Fight Club & Se7en) and was yet again good here.This movie is the textbook definition of ANTI-CLIMACTIC. You never know what the letter to the Japanese Police Luitenant says(if anyone knows what is says, please email me), you never know what happens to the two American kids, you never know if Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett get back to the states, you never know what happens when the housekeeper goes back to Mexico, you never know what happens to the boy who shot Cate Blanchett and his family and you never know what happens after the Japanese girl's father finds her and hugs her on the balcony.To close, I think it would have been much better if we knew what happened, but sometimes life makes you wonder what could happen.",Babel
436,ameh1,In a World Without Hope - Part One,7,11 March 2007,"It has taken me a few days or should I say weeks, to once again gather my thoughts together into some semblance of order and coherence, after letting my mind and body be transported into the fantastic world of cinema. Humbling myself with due reverence in front of the gods that oversee the arts and crafts of film-making. For it has been a long time since I have seen three movies in a row that have had such a tremendous impact on not only my self but on the senses of a vast segment of the population.Having already spoken my mind on the movie The Children of Men, I thought it would be appropriate to see the remaining two movies from this Mexican/Latin/Spanish Trilogy, Babel and Pan's Labyrinth (one could make it a Quartet and add the movie Volver, but I have not seen it yet). Having now seen these three movies, I am convinced that the gods of cinema have transferred the various skills of movie-making to invaders from outside its Cathedral, Hollywood, the New Spanish Armada if you must, forcing the powers that control the purse strings, to allow this sudden and dramatic burst of energy and creativity to infiltrate an establishment that has gotten lazy and too comfortable. (It is for this very reason that I am somewhat puzzled at the financial success of such a Movie as Night at the Museum. Having forced myself to see it, I do not understand its success and the money it has made. One could say the same about Dreamgirl's and the Pirates of the Caribbean)What is common in all three movies is that they are extremely strong when it comes to the basics. With scripts that are complete and cohesive, absorbing and extremely effective. All the techniques of the film-making process; from the cinematography, to sound, to the editing and acting; bring to life in a most wonderful way, the power and the drama that is inherent in the written words and sentences, in the tragic nature of the characters, their relationships and conflicts, and in the brutality and honesty with which the story unfolds out there on the silver screen, in front of our very eyes.Having now gathered all the resources and the sophisticated technology, and assembled the talent, it will all be a waste if there is no direction, a unique perspective, a singular point of view. This is the responsibility of the director. They must use their skill and imagination, and the resources at their disposal to create the magic. All the three directors have succeeded beyond expectation, and have created masterful art works that have to a certain extent, shaken the established order of things. They have all shown commitment and dedication, and displayed a passion and desire to express themselves through their movies without any reservations or shyness, telling the story as it was created, with all its brutality and honesty, refusing to compromise. Sometimes, as one watches these movies it can get frightening, and in spite of your self you want to tell them to stop, that is enough. There were one or two instances in the movies Babel and Pans Labyrinth, towards the end, where I thought they had taken things to far. The audiences by the end leave the theater, shaken, moved and disturbed. Set in the present, Babel is disturbingly real, with the minimal use of sound, used only when necessary, the harsh and realistic settings, the shaky camera and the close ups, the editing, have all been designed to convey an impression of extreme reality. Like the direction, the acting is audacious and daring, fearless, with an unwillingness to compromise or soften the power of the script. The movie is at once personal and intimate, universal and comprehensive, effectively managing to bring harmonious closure, to seemingly discordant and disparate story lines. In the end we are left with a bold statement on the universal nature of human ignorance and prejudice, emphasizing the fact that it does not matter which part of the world you belong, we are basically prone to the same problems and weaknesses, often displaying a natural self-destructive tendency. Having said all that, I preferred Children of Men, it was shot in a style that has a sense of urgency and is extremely intense. I found it to be more complete and satisfying, with strong and powerful cinematography. It was far more deserving and should have been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.We the audience watched amazed, deeply moved by what we saw. Realizing that there actually exists a world beyond our shores and that sometimes the rest of the world does not feel or behave the same way we do. Outside of the bubble we seem to be living in, their exist ideologies and beliefs quite different from our own, that seem to be gathering momentum and strength as the years go by, and unless we adapt and change, we will find ourselves completely isolated and vulnerable.",Babel

The plain fact is I left this movie with only about 10 minutes left, the first time ever I left a theatre early. And I felt exhausted and angry. Why? I suppose because I have freedom of thought and can't stand being manipulated through such a blatant contrivance it verges on a Grade 8 social experiment on tolerance: ie. how often can I slap you before you notice. I mean suspension of disbelief is not limitless. A great example is the Mexican nanny taking two small WHITE kids, without parental approval, from the U.S. over the border into Mexico for a wedding. Regardless of her stupidity, don't the border guards find this odd -- 2 white kids with 2 Mexicans? And how does she expect to return with them BACK into the U.S.? Hello! And I guess in Morocco when you give a child a loaded rifle you never remark, ""Hey, by the way, don't shoot at people."" The Japenese girl thing is MONGO cliché, I mean didn't her mother's death push Lolita to Humbert. (Sigh) And so on. Oh, and I like how the gang of Moroccan police don't bother to warn the children before they start blasting, even though the boy is walking away with the rifle pointed down... personally, as a writer, I'm fairly ashamed of the movies which receive all the acclaim.

The Japanese girl story was awful. Nothing interesting, nothing to think about, nothing to watch. The two kids story was I think the best, thats why I give this movie a 3 out of 10. Their story is moving, you think about it, you actually now that they are just kids playing like any other on the world, but in some places this fun is dangerous.

Many of the technical aspects of the film are undeniably great -- a talented director who managed to get a variety of good performances, from trained actors and non-actors alike. The main issue I have with the film is the story. It is difficult to really buy the connection between all the different characters (which I will not go into -- watch the film and find out). It is clear that Inarritu is trying to say something about humanity and what brings us together as well as what tears us apart. But the manner in which he does it with the four seemingly unrelated stories does not have a huge payoff. In the end, each story has it's own climax, and it's just too much -- too over the top. I love 21 GRAMS and like Amores perros, but those films seemed to hone in more on the characters, whereas this one tries to do the same but the themes and narrative are so broad that they spread everything else thin.",Babel

That the reasons are of a great variety, the director manages to illustrate in a lot of different situations. Furthermore redemption is a guidance motive of the film, while I consider it as very fine storytelling that not all characters are able to find redemption. The cast is exquisite, although some of them only being professional actors, everyone is intense and I believe them, which is the most important thing.

446,dg3-1,"Three unrelated short stories, no cohesive plot",2,12 February 2007,"After seeing the intense and provocative ""Amores Perros,"" I had very high hopes for Babel, and, WOW, did it disappoint. Beautiful cinematography, convincing acting, and sound directing was completely undone by the lack of any cohesive narrative whatsoever. The three plots were held together by no more than a single strand of hair; no one plot line had any impact on or involvement with another. What made Amores Perros so brilliant was how it wove three seemingly separate lives into and out of each other because of one freak accident; afterward all lives would be intertwined. In this case, no intertwining. I felt as if I was hopping back and forth between three entirely unrelated movies. And, because of the hopping, no single plot was given the character development, subplots, etc that they all desperately needed.Can someone please explain to me what the Japan plot had to do with ANYTHING? So he gave a gun to a Moroccan? So what? I'm sure some dollar bill I spent 10 years ago is probably in the hands of a terrorist right now, but that doesn't mean that our plots are interconnected. Or maybe it does, and that's why I don't get why people like this movie so much. Anybody's lives could be interconnected through some chance encounters and freak occurrences, but they just weren't compelling or tight here.Not to mention, the whole ""let's leave my aunt and the kids she watches in the middle of the desert in the middle of the night"" plot line. That makes a ton of sense! Nobody, no matter how drunk, would ever do that. There are enough dramas involving real illegal immigrants suffering in the desert that putting two gringo children there...I'm sorry, there's no way that could ever be considered anywhere in the realm of something approaching realistic.There is just too much wrong with the story here to make it a good movie. I appreciate the attempt to show how our attempts to understand each other so often fail and the complexities that come from living in such a diverse world, but there are any number of ways that could better be shown than through three random plots that have nothing to do with each other.There.

450,commodoresx64,Manipulative and miscalculated,2,19 November 2006,"I realize I have the minority opinion here. Yet I felt the film was a terrible miscalculation on the part of the writer and director. The film follows three interlocking stories and the characters within. It's theme is communication or the lack there of. Two of the three stories are intertwined while the third, set in Japan, is more independent of the two. The Japanese story is beautiful and stunning, it takes no unrealistic turns and each characters action is logical. (At least we understand why the characters take their respective actions.)The other stories fall flat because it follows a simple formula: 1.Set a stage filled with Good people. 2.Knock them down with grossly unrealistic plot twists. 3.Watch them suffer, cry with them, cash in on Oscar.The pacing is extremely slow and the music did very little. The director chose less dialog and more shots of the landscape to attempt to try tell a story. This is film that does get interesting, it just takes a long time to get going. However, at the end, you will feel cheated. After two or three unlikely plot twists you'll give up trying feel or care about what happens next. It's a wave of melancholy that most people choose not to catch. A good film makes you sad because of it's situations are plausible to us.

451,contact-447,Incoherent mess,3,20 January 2008,"I found this pretty disappointing, especially given the director's past form with '21 Grams'. Brad Pitt does the best he can as a husband desperately trying to get his wife medical attention in rural Morocco. His part of the film works quite well, even if Cate Blanchett's character comes across as a paranoid xenophobe who'd rather bleed to death than get stitches from a village doctor.But instead of focusing on Brad Pitt's struggle with backwoods infrastructure and insensitive tourists who think a dying wife is less serious than being stuck on a bus with no air conditioning, the film makers mix in a bunch of other 'connected' story threads that turn the film into a rambling two and a half hour long mess. This parallel stories approach has worked well before in films like Traffic, but here the plot is spread too thin and the threads linking the different stories are too tenuous. Background and character development are so minimal I suspect there's probably another two and a half hours of this lying on a cutting room floor somewhere.The other side of the story in Morocco at least has a clear connection to Pitt and Blanchett's struggles, but it's pretty daft, involving a young boy who spies on his elder sister getting undressed, and who thinks it's a good idea to test his father's new rifle by taking pot shots at passing vehicles. Conveniently, the boy can pretty much out-shoot an entire squad of police marksmen, and is stupid enough to try it.Meanwhile, back in California, Brad Pitt's illegal immigrant nanny has decided it's a good idea to take his kids across the border into Mexico when she can't find anyone else to look after them for a few hours while she goes to her son's wedding. She then lets her obviously inebriated nephew drive them all home afterwards, resulting in some (probably unintentionally) funny scenes at the border crossing that look like out-takes from Chris Rock's ""how to not get your a** kicked by the police"" sketch. The Mexicans in this film are so incredibly dumb and caricature-like, you'd think it was racist if the film's writer and director weren't both Mexican themselves. Surely they don't see their countrymen this way?The most loosely connected of all the plot threads takes place in Japan, and centers on a deaf schoolgirl who's so desperate to lose her virginity she spends most of the film flashing random strangers. To be fair, bits of this story thread are actually pretty good, including a great scene showing a drugged up night out in a club from a deaf person's point of view. But the constant gratuitous nudity renders this storyline more comedy than tragedy for the most part, and the connection to the events in Morocco that pops up near the end of the film seems like a slender excuse.The main story (or the section in Japan, for that matter) could have made a half decent direct-to-TV movie in a less ambitious film maker's hands. But all the self-conscious arty twaddle that's been piled on top of it layer-after-layer renders the whole thing about as coherent and structurally sound as the infamous tower it's named after.",Babel

You have to listen carefully to the dialog for subtle hints that will help you understand some of the characters, like the relationship between Richard and Susan and why they are on a trip to Morroco.

When it was finally over 2 ½ hours later, I could not have cared less about what happened to any of the characters.*** spoiler alert ***This ""Crash"" wannabe fell way short of its mark-- whatever that was.

This is big news? It's been done better. Was it that we are all connected in one way or another? Really? Again, done better. I am no prude, but I believe the plot line about the Moroccan boy watching his sister undress was gratuitous and unnecessary – as was the constant frontal nudity of the Japanese girl.

Another example of this is that it takes a long time before you realize the reason for the Japanese part of the film Also, many parts of the film are too dark, personally I do not like movies which are so dark. Several parts of the movie are way too long for no reason at all. This movie would have lasted less than 90 minutes if it weren't for those long scenes. However, the scenery is beautiful. The music is quite annoying sometimes at at other times it is very good. Kate Blanchett's part is not very big in that movie but she is very convincing. As for Brad Pitt he is, as usual to my opinion, great. All the ethnic comedians are quite good. The plot is excellent once you get it.

Babel is confused communication, and confounded tongues, the most blatant exposition of which in this film is the young Japanese deaf-mute community. I think it's the first film where I've seen subtitles for sign language.The Mexican sequences are also particularly convincing and it looked like a fun wedding.One or two of the plot elements seem a little bit stretched but on the whole you could imagine the events in the film really happening. However the various calamitous outcomes of people's actions can be seen coming down the track for a long time before they arrive, which is fine for raising the suspense, but is that just for suspense's sake?

Some long films keep the viewer engaged, but this one is SO drawn out that I lost interest rather quickly. Much of the movie is mundane, average, and doesn't do much to contribute to the story. Also, there are 3-4 different stories in this, and none of them are really concluded.After watching this film, I have to wonder, is there supposed to be a sequel? I know it's not the type of film to warrant one, but it leaves so many questions unanswered that it bothers me.The beginning of the film is rather interesting and kept me attentive, but after the main points are made, the rest just kind of drags behind. The whole structure of an average film is thrown into disarray, with there being many climaxes at different points, then an extremely long and drawn out denouement for each story.Though some may enjoy this type of film, I was not enthused.

It's because every damn movie made by this director is using exactly the same working formula - take three stories and twinge them together in one tragic accident. Yes, i love ice-cream. But eating it every day and night would make me sick. Especially if it's ALWAYS the same vanilla with chocolate sprinkles. Of course, i'm talking about myself, everyone else can eat it up till their stomach ache. (Hello, Golden Globe guys, and, i'm afraid the Oscar's as well - Am i glad i'm not your bathroom). But there are, besides the old formula, problems which i found to be too exasperating for me to ignore. Those stories... You see, only two of them are actually related. The Japanese part i've heard from some reviews described as the best (and i'll get to this later)is drawn to the rest, as they say it in Russian ""by ears"", or, winking to the others who already saw it - only by that sacred place miss Rinko flashes to us beneath her mini-tiny so-called skirt, a-la Sharon Stone. Unfortunately, not with the same style or reason behind it. And yes, you're right, that's one of the main reasons she's got the Golden Globe nom.The other two stories are indeed deeply related,and, maybe if the movie would concentrate on them and actually made them logical, believable, or, at least, meaningful - it might've been quite a powerful film indeed. Nah! Never happens. As it is - it's too long, too boring, too pretentious, defying human logic and common sense and sometimes simply lacking the vital information about the story and characters. Actually i can describe the movie to you just in 2 of its scenes:2 young boys in Marroco shoot just for fun in the passing below bus. In the moment of shoot they clearly aim at the bus driver as HE IS directly in front of them, on the line of fire. But get this - they shoot a woman who seats at the OPPOSITE side of the bus FROM THEM. No one even tried to check this one up, when editing the movie. Another one - when that Japanese deaf-mute girl writes near the end the note to the detective - we see her writing a few words. Later, in the bar, when he opens the notebook page, it's written all over, with no blank place left. And those are not accidental mistakes - they say it all about the movie. There were some good moments, which at least felt real. I mean in Marroco and Mexican parts. Yes, life is a surprising thing and sometimes people do stupid things they'd never do upon revision, and yes, such ""litlle mistakes"" do lead to tragedies.So why after all i'm more familiar with the Marrocan desert then with the main characters? And one of the few things the director decided to share with us was how one of them watches his sister naked and masturbates after wards? How really important it was to the story? Take this part out - and you won't notice anything amiss at all. This is true actually of the whole Japanese section. Look, i don't know much about deaf people. But i saw some, as most of us did. None of them ever ""talked"" like miss Rinko does. If they'd do - i'd be dead on spot simply passing by - I'd be killed by one of her elbows, i kid you not. To me it seemed like screaming! Constant screaming! If she'd talk - we all'd be deaf 5 minutes after her hysterical screeches called acting. I just have to ask - do deaf people in Japan really act differently from the rest of the world? I might be mistaken but from what i saw, the actress is as deaf in real life as me. It seemed very fake to me. But if i'm mistaken, please, let me know and i'll apologize and erase this.Besides, there were a couple of scenes that left me scratching my head. Why the deaf-mute from childbirth girl immediately looses herself in the most usual situations she certainly should be really well familiar with? Like, entering the café? Like starting with the regular guys? By the way, if she wants the sex so much- why not to try it with her familiar deaf guys like her? What's the matter, they're not good enough for her? Or for her desperate need in human communication as the director wants us to believe? Every deaf girl around her seems to be fine, so what's the problem with her in particular? Because of her mom? I didn't see her care about it for a single moment. And for those 5 minutes of his screen time her dad seemed to be a very patient, caring and loving person. Why should I, or anyone else for that matter, feel for this sex-crazed angsty teenager (who seems to be at least 20 years old)? I think she needs a good spanking, shrink and good medicine - BEFORE she'd be able to communicate with normal people.And why to throw in that dead mom story at all? To make us feel sorry about her a bit more? Well, it's official now- i'm a cold-hearted bitch because I didn't, not at the least. And nakedness+crying(which was so-o-o-o-o predictable, it's not even funny) doesn't account for purity and sincerity, desperation and openness. Only for the prestigious academy awards where it passes as ""powerful acting"". If you want to be understood - try to make a better movie. Then, you won't need any tag lines at all.",Babel

460,sarasvatia,An incident caused by a couple of kids has a ripple effect in four countries.,9,16 November 2006,"To each of our actions there often are apposite and unequal reactions, some with devastating, if unintended, consequences. This is the intention behind 'Babel', a very well written and cogent story, beautifully executed by all involved in the making of this picture. If you have an open mind and are open to accepting other cultures just as they are, you will enjoy this picture. If you have not traveled outside the well-beaten path of tourist traps, know little or nothing about old and new customs evolving at different rates: from the very slow in e.g. Morocco to the super fast in e.g. Japan and the impact of our prejudices and preconceived notions; if you think yourself wo/man of the world, you will like this picture. The deceptively calm direction allows the viewer to forget about his/her immediate safe surroundings: a mark of a great director who calls on our powers of empathy as he transforms us into witnesses living the story together with the protagonists. This is a director who inspired powerful performances from the well-established paragons of contemporary cinema as well as bit players. The camera responds to this effort by capturing the idiosyncratic colour and texture of each location to enhance and elucidate the unravelling story. This is a picture that provokes thoughtful and meaningful discussion, a bonus from the gifted writer and director with a rare ability to embrace all of humanity without passing judgment. This is a picture that will stay with you long after you have left the cinema.",Babel
461,kgbellinger24,Utterly Compelling...,10,13 January 2007,"After just recently being struck by the emotional intensity that 21 grams never let up, I searched for a new movie by Innaritu. What I got was Babel, an independent movie that was released a couple months ago that I looked past. Like many of you, I saw a B average, which was something that steered me away, expecting a higher B or even A's for Inarritu's potential. However, when its acclaim started to roll in such as the Globes nominations I started to find interest again. So I saw it, and now I understand why this movie has provoked such polar reactions. First things first, this movie's ambition and cinematography set it apart from the rather pretentious and overblown Crash. Although many have argued this is just as pretentious and pseudo-liberal as Crash, this movie has some pretentious concepts. But nonetheless the ambition for realism, and portrayal of the language barrier and its effects on society is astonishing. This movie opened my eyes to the grand miscommunication that is around the world. Many have argued the film was an extremely long bore where they could not find one character to care or relate to. Although I am being slanted, the negative reactions are a result from looking at the surface or the obvious aspects of the film. I've read some reactions like, ""What the hell was that, what was the point?"". That's where they missed the essence of this movie. The movie's purpose isn't to leave you with an assertive message like ""life is a tragedy, deal with it"" or something like that, but its purpose is to portray a grim perspective on the world today and how clashing cultures can bring chaos. Although the films slow points may irritate the stimuli-driven viewer it does have some intense scenes to compensate and for some reason it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next unlike 21 grams. Innaritu again and again seems to bring incendiary and explosive acting to the table. Brad Pitt shines, Blanchett though limited has her wrenching moment in the beginning, and Barazza and Kikuchi are diamonds in the rough. The writing and interrelated stories though is slightly inconsistent in terms of linking, but all in all, it is mind-blowing with its subtleties and ambition. Bottom-Line: Babel is ultimately an iceberg, some will only see the surface and be discouraged at its sight, while some will see the immense underlying layers beneath the surface that only draws the viewer to look deeper.",Babel
462,jeremy-liebster-1,Insulting to the intelligence,2,19 February 2007,"I loved Amores Perros and was really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately where Amores Perros was personal and touching, Babel in trying to be global and important was cliché ridden and non-sensical. As others have said, the acting, music and cinematography were impressive, which is why I have given this film 2 instead of 1 out of 10. But the story - please... I actually found it quite insulting to the intelligence that this film actually claimed to have a message - people should listen to each other. Perhaps if Guillermo Arriaga had spent more time listening and observing people he would have a better understanding of how people actually act in real life. Which is not in any way like they do in this film. An American couple with two small children trying to get over a major problem with their marriage and the death of a child would simply not leave their small kids to go on a coach tour halfway across the world. Coach tours are not intimate - trust me - i've been on one. And Morocco - great choice of country if Cate Blachett is a hygiene freak.The reactions of the fellow passengers to the crisis once Blanchett gets shot - absolutely laughable. When one of their company has been shot all they can apparently do is moan about air conditioning, panic about the sinister locals and demand the driver leaves without the injured woman. There is no way in the world they would act like that but clearly the writer wanted to show fat Western tourists behaving like crass idiots. And my word if that wasn't hackneyed enough, we then saw the western insensitivities contrasted with the subtlety of a sledge-hammer with the 'noble' locals who took care of Blanchett after the wounding. A Moroccan peasant woman with a wrinkled face treating Blanchett with ancient medicine and saving her life. She even whispered mystical chants and gave her a pipe to smoke. It was like something out of Dances with Wolves. The clichés were coming thick and fast by now. We then had the Americans refusing to allow Blanchett to leave in a Moroccan ambulance. Well that just did it for me. We have an international 'terrorist' incident which we are told is on the news worldwide and we are expected to believe that the American government would allow the apparently-dying American victim to stay in a cave being treated with herbal medicine because of diplomatic red tape? Extraordinary.But perhaps not as extraordinary as the absurd story of the childminder of Blanchett's children taking them off to Mexico. The childminder's employer has just been shot by apparent terrorists and the story is on every news channel. We are talking major international incident. For all she knows the children's mother is about to die. Yet she takes them in a car to Mexico for her son's wedding. Please!! Give me strength. If this incident was happening all of the parents' relations would be at the house, someone would be able to take care of the children for crying out loud! And when she goes to Mexico after the party she allows her nephew who is clearly drunk to drive back her charges. And why not wait until he is sober - because the children have soccer practice. That's right - they have been up all night, they are driving back to San Diego, their mother has been shot and yet they will still be going to soccer practice in the morning. We are then expected to believe that the nephew would simply drive through the road block and leave his aunt and the children in the middle of the desert. People might think I am being nitpicky on these points but the problem is that it is impossible to take a film seriously (and Babel wants to be taken very very seriously) when the story is so ludicrous.As for the Japanese story. Well my only problem with that was that it shouldn't have been there. Who cares who sold the gun that shot Blanchett? It's not as though getting hold of guns is difficult. No, Arriaga must have been racking his brains for weeks trying to come up with a plausible excuse for having a story about a Japanese mute included in the film to cement its Oscar credentials. Unfortunately it is, like the rest of the film, a complete sham. Sorry to have gone on but Babel actually made me that cross!",Babel

I can't believe this piece of crap even got made. It had some great performanes, but it did not make any sense.

464,lathbury,Four apparently separate stories are interlocked by a shooting.,8,19 August 2007,"The four at first distinct narrative lines in _Babel_ veer toward tragedy: the Morroccan family that acquires a rifle, whose children start it all; the traveling American couple (well played by Pitt and Blanchett) with a troubled marriage accidentally caught up in it; the nanny back in San Diego guarding the couple's two children; and the Asian (Korean?) daughter and father whose link to the first three plots is the most tangential. Only the first of the four strains delivers on the film's tragic, ironic sensibility and delivers the end toward which events have been building. The second dilemma is rather improbably saved at the last moment and off camera; in fact, the moving first story shows how effective a non-Hollywood resolution might have been. The third offers a more plausible and qualified resolution; the last feels incompletely worked through. All these stories, running simultaneously and deftly cut off at points of high dramatic tension, are in their own ways affecting, but the film is uneven and too long by about twenty minutes. Its modernist manner seems not wholly germane to the conception but still entertains.",Babel
465,OliverT,"Lots of good points but far, far, far too depressing for me.",6,11 March 2007,"I watched this film after seeing the Oscars and therefore I expected quite a lot. In many ways I think it is a good film - great acting & cinematography, the roles are well cast and all scenes are realistic and believable. My problem with the film was that I expected that at some stage in the film I would get the point, that moment when you say ""Oh yeah, now I see what this is all about!"", but for me that moment never happened - of course, I know all the scenes are interconnected but but I don't think the connection is particularly meaningful. Each story did have a beginning and an end, but each was so depressing that I really wondered what the whole point of the film was. Was he trying to say that guns are bad? Was that the whole point of the film? That would account for the moral of all stories but the Mexican one. Maybe the point is that guns & drink driving are bad? I don't know. Its not that I desperately need the Hollywood happy ending but throw me a bone here - the Japanese girl has to go on dealing with being a mute adolescent who saw her mother shot through the head, the Moroccan family lost a son and their lives are ruined, the Mexican nanny was deported and lost everything she worked the last 16 years for. Only Brad & Kate had a glimmer of happiness as they seemed to come to terms with their child's death and move forward in life. In short, not really my cup of tea but obviously I'm in a minority!",Babel
466,kaizer_soze,"Worth a watch, but not for everyone.",7,30 December 2006,"Think Babel and you think of the mythical tower, filled with people talking in tongues, each unintelligible to the others.The Bible suggests that this was a trick played by god. Ambitious humans were attempting to build a tower, near Babylon, that could reach Heaven; by creating a whole slew of languages, God ensured they wouldn't be in sync with their plans, and would find themselves lost in the morass of their own linguistic confusion.The centuries-old tale inspires director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, in his latest offering Babel, starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchet, to show that inspite of globalization, the internet, and the shrinking of the world into a global village, human beings essentially are yet to learn to communicate with one another.The storyline revolves around a rifle, that connects four different lives in four countries: Japan, Morocco, the US and Mexico.Four different people who will never meet each other are linked by a small incident involving a child firing off a rifle; that one act and how it changes the lives of four families drives the plot.The rifle shot hits an American tourist (Cate Blanchett) who is traveling with her husband Brad Pitt in a last-ditch effort to make her marriage work. The incident becomes global news; contemporary issues like terrorism come into play, and in the reaction to the incident, the director shows how ignorant we are of each other's culture.Elsewhere, a Mexican nanny crosses the US border to attend her son's wedding, loses her way, and is arrested by the American police. Also key to the plot is a Japanese tourist who first sells the rifle, and his daughter, a sex-starved deaf-mute whose portrayal has to be seen to be believed.Inarritu brings past, present and future together in a way that leaves you in awe of his storytelling skills, and his grip on narrative. Also worth mentioning is the comparisons between life in the first and third worlds, told in non-judgemental fashion by the director.Personally, I myself was a little disturbed after watching this movie. Can't say why but it didn't meet the expectations I had set after watching Crash. Still worth a watch, but not for everyone.",Babel

468,svicious22,Ultimately pointless indulgence,2,18 March 2007,"I felt this movie was trying, but failed, in making any sort of profound point about the interconnectedness of humanity and the importance and role of communication, or anything else for that matter. And it desperately needed to make some sort of profound point, given its obvious ambition and intentions in that regard. It was nothing more than a ""slice of life"" movie on a grand, international scale, and felt severely indulgent on the part of the director and all involved. Coming from someone who loved Amores Perros and liked 21 Grams quite a bit, I have to say this was a disappointing movie.The acting was mixed, with Brad Pitt wooden and one-dimensional and Cate Blanchett annoying and quite unsympathetic. The Japanese scenes felt a tad contrived and left some unanswered questions although I felt the acting was fairly credible. The non-linear timeline and inter-cutting events from three different story lines was not used to great effect and had a tired feeling this time around.

I loved the cinematography, although it was pretentious and a bit cliché at times....especially the scene with the Moroccan kids with their arms spread at the top of the mountain....please.Anyhow, good stories, pretty good actors, I hated Brad Pitt's loser wife, man was she a real ray of sunshine, grow up, you didn't have to go to Morocco. The Japanese girl story was good too, and same with the little kids. But that's really it, it was just ""yeah it was good"".However, the more I think about this movie the more ridiculous i realize it was. The whole way it was filmed is kind of tired and the mood and atmosphere created from the music and effect and camera-work all just seem really recycled. It's typical big-budget pretentious Hollywood PC watered-down film with a big name actor thrown in there to appeal to the masses. Everything was too conveniently linked to current political issues and the messages sent by the director were not subtle in any way. They were entirely way to obvious and it really took away from the stories, made it seem too much like a film where the losers in Hollywood are trying to teach a lesson to all the ignorant minds in America. Borat was more successful in exposing the ugly side of our country, this was just contrived and just blah.We all know that guy, the kid who saw one Linklater movie and decided he wanted to watch ""film"" rather than ""movies"" and walks around bitching and moaning about the current sad state of affairs of the American cinema.

I know these people, I lived with one through college.That's what ""Babel"" is, its a movie for wanna-be pretentious film snobs to put on a pedestal and claim it was amazing when in fact, they don't know anything. I can hear all the millionaire jerks in California walking out of this movie going ""SEE...we are so bad...and we judge other countries so bad now and we create problems through our narrow mindedness and we are mean to the poor illegal immigrants and we should let drunk drivers cross our borders with kids in the cars not be such big meany pants to them blah blah"" This movie is for losers who think they know it all; and no, I'm not some conservative republican.

470,adamcarter-63372,Too Scattershot To Have Any Real Meaning,3,14 July 2017,"Babel is a flat out bad movie. The movie's main message is that pain is universal. We all suffer and we all go through hardships no matter who were are or where we come from but outside of that it has nothing else to say. The film poorly tries to weave four stories together of people that are suffering. However, we cannot truly connect with any of these people because we are not given time to get to know them. The characters themselves are as thin as a bed sheet. There is nothing else interesting about them outside of their main conflict. The movie came off incredibly pointless. Think of it this way. Imagine walking out onto your driveway and finding a bleeding cat dying right in front of you. Now imagine in a faraway place some unknown strangers starving to death. The bleeding cat is going to be more relevant to you even though several people starving to death is much worse. Why? Because it is something you can see and feel right in front of you. It is something you can have an impact on. The movie is more like the starving people than it is the bleeding cat. Babel comes off as misery porn. Simple as that. We watch a woman shot through the neck and bleed out, a child die in front of his father, and a young girl almost rape a man because she could never get a sexual release. If you are going to make me watch this kind of material, you need a strong and powerful payoff. This movie has none. Babel could have been a stronger movie if it had only focused on two stories and had given more time to develop stronger characters. This idea could work for a TV show, but not for a feature film. The only idea this film has is that pain is universal. But guess what? I didn't need Babel to tell me that.",Babel
471,csabarish,most compelling,10,2 January 2007,"My mind is still reeling. I watched this movie last night and I have never been persuaded to question myself this brutally ever before. I am calling it brutal not because of the violence in the movie, it is definitely less than any Mel Gibson gore fest. But it made me question the cocoon that i have built around myself. All with good reason. Just to protect my own existence. Just doing my job as best as i can. Breaking the traffic signal once in a while is as far as i go to tease the law. But is that enough? Enough to call myself a human being? So much prejudice goes behind building this cocoon that all the rest of the people get clubbed into categories with associated percentages. Most deaf and dumb kids are mentally disturbed. Most of the Arab world is militant. We are scared of everyone and in turn scare everyone off. Pre-emptive measures, but to what end? The movie staying true to the source of its name shows us what happens when we do not communicate. Probably it goes even further and shows us that probably all that is wrong with this world is because we do not communicate. In the microcosm of the deaf and mute girl, the efficient sentry's realm of power, the charming rake's non-chalance and the macrocosm of international relations, it is (as the movie puts it) because we do not care to listen that so many things get screwed up. But more than that the movie-maker seems to have a hypothesis as to why we act as foolishly and dis compassionately as we do. It is the prejudice, the belief in percentages and the instinct, that we pick up in the name of growing up, of mistrusting every other human being before we have a reason to trust them. It is self preservance, but at what cost? One more question that the movie dares to ask is whether humanity is not to be held above law? It is sticky wicket and the maker of the movie is only hinting at his beliefs on that head as the topic cannot be won convincingly in the favor of either arguments.For all it manges to do during its obviously flawed (also somewhat contrived) course to say that the movie is compelling will not be an overstatement by any standards. Acting is uniformly excellent. I found the Mexican nanny to be the most heartwrenching. She is so good and rational and just, the actor has played the part so brilliantly that my heart went out to her. Blanchett made me believe she was in pain. Pitt, Bernal and the boys were genuine enough for one to feel compassionate towards their flawed characters. A very worthy cast for what is is now one of my favorite movies.

474,dnlcmch,A film of immense raw and emotional power.,9,5 December 2006,"Being the third and final installment in Alejandro Inarritu's ""broken narrative"" trilogy, Babel focuses on the walls we build amongst ourselves as both nations and human beings. It wouldn't really be fair to compare Babel with Inarritu's two previous efforts for the trilogy because the films are ambitious in their own way. Yet, what can be said is that Inarritu has once again succeeded in presenting us with a riveting and meticulously handled study of the human condition during its darkest and most defeated hours, tackling issues and themes that prove to be essential to the matter (death, redemption, alienation...).The film opens in the vast void of the mundane Moroccan desert. Everything is dry, dusty, and deserted. We are introduced to a family that reflects the economy and state of country, bent on agriculture and dysfunction. The father has just received a brand new gun that shall bring great use in killing off the coyotes and their ravenous craving for herds of sheep. The two sons of the family, both preteens, are enthused by the new weapon and use it as a sort of tool of competition. Yet, once they start to test their aim on passerby buses, tragedy strikes, as an American tourist is pierced in the neck by a fatal bullet. The single shot is soon heard around the world, being represented in the media as a ""terrorist act"", as it ultimately interweaves the stories of very different groups of people on three different continents. After the death of their infant son, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susa(Cate Blanchett) decide to venture in Morocco, hopefully seeking reconciliation. As things turn out, the two become rather peeved by each other. Although we never really know what happened for sure, we do understand the positions that the two have been put in. As we feel the anger and frustration in Susan's presence, we feel Richard's vulnerability and weakness. Once Susan finds herself pierced by the bullet, their compassion towards each other is tested as she walks closer and closer towards death's door. Meanwhile in America, their son and daughter of around six and seven, travel to Mexico with their nanny and her notoriously, yet comedic irresponsible nephew, Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), in order to reach a personally long-expected wedding. The way into the country is easy, but the way out is questionable. In Japan, a def-mute teen-aged girl, Chieko, suffers from the aftermath of her mother's suicide and the alienation she must deal with in her everyday life, resulting in her intense need for attention and a human's warmth. Can she come to terms with her problems and find light during these dark hours? Will she be able to escape her intimate frustration around the world? Her fate, as well as the fate of those across the globe, are determined by ever-effecting course of events that echo that fatal shot. How can we heel our most fatal wounds? Is it a matter of forgiveness? Do we have to suffer through misfortune in order to embark upon redemption? These are the questions that Babel ponders upon. Inarritu succeeds in having the film's melancholy atmosphere reflect its realism and the characters' state of being. From the mundane deserts of Morocco and Mexico to the explosive vibrancy of Japan, Inarritu presents us with a sort of visual poetry that works brilliantly as part of the film's form of storytelling. Babel can be considered as a ""quiet movie"", if you will. Although it does use subtitles in order to translate foreign languages, it is extremely heavy in translating the characters' emotions through sufficient visuals and characterized facial expressions made by the actors, making us easily feel the essence of the film by bathing our eyes in the screen.Babel is an all-out heart wrenching film and an exuberant panorama of the effects of unfortunate coincidence, for better or for worse. There's no doubt that audiences are being strictly divided with ultimately lukewarm responses as some may criticize its disability to find its purpose throughout its running-time. Most mainstream moviegoers may not even understand its ambiguousness and intricate themes and storyline. And if you have a hard time swallowing the complex issues and themes that Babel provides, it can all be easily summed up with that celestial last shot.",Babel
475,lelia-agostinho,we are all together,9,16 April 2007,"I loved this movie. It is supported by a very deep and boundless understanding of life and meaning. No matter how lonely one feels, we are all together in the world. Not just because of modern technologies and fast travels, but because Earth is our boat and ocean and sky. We all share life amongst each others and our minds are one. So this movie is wonderful in the way it stresses the connections between us all, no matter where and how we live. What we look like, what we think, what we feel, what we want are differences in the whole we share. The way this movie plays with prejudices and interpretations is excellent. All the work in it is wonderful.",Babel
476,riyado,We must be able to communicate,9,14 January 2007,"It took me a little time to understand why we see non-connected stories of different group of people in different spots on the earth. Then I got it, they are strongly connected. The development of communication means succeeded to connect the world with each other but did not succeed to make the world communicated. We see the Americans feel strange in Morrocco, the Mexicans are still perceived as suspects in the States, the deaf girl in Japan can not make normal relations, any accident in an Arab country must be a terrorist attack. This ""mis communication"" between humans is becoming more controversial issue with the development of communication means. Brad Bit made an amazing performance and he exploites his acting talent not his handsome appearance as he used to do. And the Morrocian little buy was extraordinary. I hope we all have got the message.",Babel
477,cmartin333,"Too long, but how mesmerizing.",9,19 February 2007,"The plot is original and the story is intense. I expected a lot of violence and was pleased to see the sensibility and verity of this film. I've read mixed review on Brad Pitts character and I agree with the ones that hail him as a true actor through and through. It's a breath of fresh air watching him play the non pretty boy or buff role with such candor and vulnerability. I think it's an honest and devastating portrayal of a husband and father trying to keep his family together. I would like to see him continue to shine in these types of roles.Babel left me with a sense of emptiness that I don't think Inarritu intended. Each situation is made to make you fall into your deepest sensitive spot yet I found myself bored at times and daydreaming because the shots are beautifully pointless. How long can a shot be before it turns from incredible into a self indulgent.I recommend the film to everyone because of the script. It's surprising and eventful, heart stopping, and adventurous, innocent, and cruel, loving, and inspiring. I give it a 9 out of 10 simply because of the length of time it takes to tell this creative and exploitive tale.",Babel

However, the movie is still pure art. Brad Pitt is good but it is the Japanese girl that steals the show. It is amazing how the director gathering the story round a gun but i think the story about the Mexican woman is to much. It is nothing wrong about it, just a story to much that takes an extra half hour of your life away. Without that one this movie is a perfect 10/10. The way of using the chaos theory about how a gun from japan kills a child and nearly a woman in Marocco is brilliant. The message is clear. The biggest problems of the world is caused by bad communication. That makes it a very important movie, even if it is too long.",Babel

Really exciting until it gets boring in the 2nd half of this film.The only thing wasn't just the story and concept that was good, but some of the performances (including Pitt and Blanchett's) were amazing and inspiring.",Babel

And I speak Japanese, Spanish and understand some Arabic. And I can honestly say, the direct did a very good job in showing the different cultures of the four countries.This movie is about how people get mistunderstood easily by those around them, because the lack of communications. We thought we knew those around us, but actually we don't. And eventually, the truth comes out and we are surprised. If we pay more attention to those around us, the situation would have been different.But at the same time, the world is getting flatter than ever, one little incident happened in a small corner of the world, and all of a sudden, the whole knows about it. Some Americans may think that people living in primitive tribes may not know what's going on around the world, but that's dead wrong. Even the Masai people in the center of African wildness know what a GPS is. People are the same all over the world and we are only superficially different. Plug one person to another place, the basic human nature will come out.This is a movie that will make you take a second look at your families, see what's really important.

Even mixing the story lines non-linearly á la Pulp Fiction doesn't help, as the stories are all quite simple. Some of the characters are overplayed (all of the Westerners in Morocco, for example), as are the cheap shots at the US. Throughout the movie one always expects the worse, and the sense of foreboding eventually gets tedious, particularly since not everybody comes to a miserable end. And as for the Japanese subplot, one cannot help wondering what on earth that is all about.Some of the scenes are enjoyable, but all in all the movie is way too slow, miserable, and rather pointless.

484,josecarlosamador,"A waste of talent, a bunch of clichés and prejudice...",3,3 March 2012,"This is perhaps the movie I most regret paying for...Spoilers incoming!It tells the story of 4 different families that could be made in 4 different movies to be honest. Instead, all the histories lie all within the same film. It could have been a much more deeper movie...1 - Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play the role of a husband and wife who lost their son and are on a trip to try to overcome that event. They did their characters in a fantastic way! I believe this was one of the best Brad Pitt's interpretation. Their ""family"" is probably the one you'll know deeper in the movie. Still it's all about a couple that had suffered the loss of a son and how that's affecting them. No real lesson to be learned or plot at all.2 - Gael García Bernal, which is a good actor, had to waste all his talent to feed the prejudice against mexicans. In other words: mexicans are bad people and mexicans always have trouble with the police. That was the lesson his character gave us. 3 - The character Anwar is just a poor man who sees his family being ruined after one of his sons shoots a tourist with his recently bought rifle. What's the lesson given by his character? None!4 - Rinko Kikuchi plays Chieko, a Japanese girl whose mother committed suicide. This is perhaps the most twisted character of the movie. She is a deaf girl who has trouble with relationships due to her disability. During the movie she shows herself as a naughty girl who tries to use her body to gain relationships, ending up using drugs and with a depression. Her father doesn't seem to be very present due to his work. She seems to play the role of a sexual fantasy ""lolita"" type of girl and nothing good came out of this character at all. In the end of the movie I was actually expecting something good coming out of here, like being able to live with her disability, finding someone good for her, etc., but no!In the end, this movie just profiles different stereotypes, mostly related to nationality and culture from other countries. It's a movie that worships the American way of life and the American culture and despise all sorts of other nationalities. A complete waste of talent in a movie that could have been much deeper!I'll give 3/10 only because of the production and how good the actors were able to play their roles.",Babel
485,sivilcavage,gritty but not grisly: iñárritu's most successful experiment with this form,10,8 November 2006,"be glad for iñárritu. that man makes some gutsy movies. they have a lot in common with other movies i've seen (style-wise, 'babel' is experimental although taking a more minimal approach in contrast to the way, say, fernando mereilles' movies are. it's gritty but not grisly, to put it one way) it takes some guts to make the movies that he makes. and that's exactly where they hit you when they're not piercing your heart or grappling with your mind.i'm glad to see any of the ""little guys"" make a big movie. 'babel' was such an appropriate movie, i think, to see before 'the fountain' (another movie i've been looking forward to this year). they both have a lot of buzz and both come from directors i admire, and are projects that i otherwise don't get to see in wide release. i'd rather see someone small but with tremendous imagination make a spectacular movie than someone colossal, with a titanic budget, and an ""average joe""-type imagination (i'm in that pool, so hey, don't splash me) make a ""blockbuster"". that's not to say ""blockbusters"" aren't for me. they are, they're for everyone. but i've gotten to a point where i appreciate movies for their ""imagineering"" (i hate that word but, darnit, it suits what i'm saying) what the mind, the technology, the means and the medium can forge. it's almost like visual alchemy.but, there's also the element of the story. i think a lot of people forget that what they're seeing is a story. often their senses are engaged, but not their minds. 'babel' is the kind of movie that grabs your brain with clenched fists to tell you a big story. altho it seems to have a convoluted and disjointed story (if you've seen iñárritu's previous work, you're familiar with it) it's the director's style and it's the command that he has over this particular style that's fascinating to see and experience. you don't get to see much stuff like it. the characters spill over into one another's lives yet they're so far apart, they say things that echo in another's thoughts or actions, and it all seems like a dream. it seems at first like chaos but it's too beautiful to be mere chaos. and i see aronofsky's work intersecting with iñárritu's in this regard. they put together thought-provoking stories about people who are as ordinary, innocent, hopeful, angry, disappointed, scared, courageous, and (in)sane as anyone else. it's fantastic, is a short way to put it, simply fantastic.see this movie with someone that you usually have good discussions with, trust me, you'll have some great things to discuss after you see 'babel'.",Babel

Early in the film, when we're seeing the call from Amelia's end, Pitt was telling her she had to stay and watch the children, even if it meant missing her son's wedding. Near the end of the movie, though, when we see the call from Pitt's end, he tells Amelia that ""Rachel"" is coming to watch the kids and it's OK for Amelia to go to the wedding.Huh?!This is not a minor point, since there would have been no reason for Amelia to take the kids to Mexico if someone else was watching them.

No revelations to be found. No laughs, no ""aha!"" moments anywhere. Some works of art illustrate the futility of life, man's inhumanity to man, and offer insight into our own struggles --but unfortunately not Babel. A shallow movie, when it knows it is shallow, can be amusing at times. But the worst thing is, Babel thinks it is saying something. It is trying to con us into believing that something profound is being said: something about our inability to communicate, something about cultures, something about families.

488,dukis-1,"Dreary,tactlessly presented and incredibly unrealistic movie",1,31 July 2007,"After seeing""Amores perros"" and""21 grams"",I really expected a lot from Alejandro Inarritu's latest feature""Babel"".Pretty pompous and masterpiece-wise announcements increased my interest.I heard this was the piece that completes the trilogy,so I couldn't wait to get it and see it.I expected a true refreshment in comparison to today's irritating blockbusters,sequels,re-makes and comic-book adaptations. Boy,was I wrong!That was one of the most unpleasant surprises in my entire life.This movie did not satisfy me in any respect.Let's start from the alleged depth that it has:people should be more tolerant,caring,loving,etc. to one another.Illegal immigrants,non-white races and challenged people should be treated as equal members of society.I agree.But,this movie presented the message as if it were written on a piece of paper and distributed among the listeners of some lecture on equality.Without any style,without intelligent script,without thoroughly explained interpersonal relationships,cultural differences or backgrounds.We know very little about the characters.Misfortunes happen one after another,but the circumstances of every one of them are inexplicably unrealistic.(Maybe the part of the message was that misfortunes are essentially needless and senseless.)But,as I said before,the artistic touch is missing.Arabic children test the gun by firing at least ten bullets randomly,one of which magically hits an American tourist in a crowded bus.What are the odds for something like that?Haley's comet is more regular.I would love to meet a father who would give a rifle to his 8-to-10-year-old sons and leave them be.Secondly,what's the point of watching a kid masturbating behind a rock?The shooting scene lacks continuity.Blanchett kisses Pitt right after urinating!?As far as Mexican immigrants are concerned,the director is biased to the point of irritation.I am very aware of the position that minorities have,but the degree of their humility in this movie is ridiculous at times.Gael Garcia Bernal's character starts a conflict with the police without any obvious reason,but his own stubbornness and drunkenness.But,why did he actually disobeyed the police and run?We cannot possibly know.And the only message the director left us when it comes to the deaf Japanese girl is that challenged people should be treated equally as everybody else and their parents should spend more time with them.But,why did her mother commit suicide?Does she maybe want to have her father actually?What is really happening in her head?No answer.This part of the story is very shallow and superficial.There have been many movies dealing with human handicaps,and this is one of the weakest.Inarritu's message again lacks style,originality,sensitivity and art.It simply grabs you,it is like a violent penetration,leaves you at a loss.I was astounded by the number of awards it was nominated for.This is a film with a solid commercial background,trying to pass for a masterpiece,supported by some famous actors.But,the movie is,for the most of the time,simply senseless.None of the actors was a standout-it is a shame for Cate Blanchett,she is one of few good young actresses.Ladies,if you like Brad Pitt,see him in ""Legends of the Fall"" or ""Seven"".This movie is also too long for its own good.An utter disappointment.",Babel
489,jonathanjameskelly,Surprised that it's up for so many awards...,5,26 January 2007,"I admit I got caught up in all the hype but I went to see this movie with an open mind. Unfortunately I was disappointed.First, let me just say that the acting is superb across the board. Brad Pitt especially portrays the anguished foreigner who desperately needs help in a county that neither speaks the language, or has the appropriate medical facilities. The so called ""non-actors"", a term which I don't like, are also great. Sometimes a little too great, for example one scene where the young boys who cause the film's main tragedy are repeatedly hit by their father, it hardly looks like acting and seems all too real. Also the two children that play Brad Pitt's kids are also very convincing.The film is also beautifully shot. The locations are stunning ranging from Morocco to Japan to Mexico. You get a feel for what life is like in all these countries, the barren land and poor goat herders of Morroco, the hustle and bustle of a huge city like Tokyo, and the difference a few miles makes between life in San Diego and life in Mexico.I also like the decision to make one of the main characters a deaf mute living in the heart of a major city. Some of the scenes which have no sound really emphasise the loneliness and isolation this young girl feels.So, you ask, why didn't I like the movie? The story just isn't that good. I just found it boring and depressing and a little too unbelievable. It runs at 2 hours 15 minutes. After an hour and a half I was shifting in my seat and checking my watch. I also took the time to look around me and about 90% of the audience was doing the same. You see, not a lot happens. Please skip the next paragraph if you don't want to know the basic story of the whole movie. ***SPOILER ALERT***** A husband and wife are in Morocco on holidays. They lost a baby, we assume recently. We don't really know why they're there. Their other two kids are minded by a Mexican nanny. In Morocco a goat herder buys a riffle for his sons to shoot jackals to protect the goats. It just so happens that this gun was given to the seller by a Japanese hunter (yes, that was out of the blue! I don't know many Japanese that go to Morocco to hunt). The boys use the gun to shoot at a bus, they hit Kate Blanchett's character in the shoulder. Her husband tries to get her to a hospital but they are in the middle of nowhere. They go to a small town and wait for their embassy to get a helicopter. Meanwhile in Japan, this Japanese hunter's daughter is a lonely deaf mute. She's mourning the death of her mother through suicide and doesn't fit in. Her hobbies include sexual frustration and taking off her clothes. Meanwhile in San Diego it's the Mexican nanny's son's wedding. She is responsible for the two children and nobody else can take them. She decides to take them over the border with her. Her nephew is their ride home. He gets spooked on the way back over the border by the cops and tries to evade them, leaving his aunt and the two kids in the desert alone at night. Day comes and it's hot, the kids are tired. She leaves to two kids to get help. She finds it, the kids are saved and she gets deported for her efforts. Meanwhile in Japan a father and naked daughter embrace and in Morocco the shot woman survives and is fine. The end. ***END SPOILERS***OK if you've read that it looks like a lot on paper but in reality not much happens. Especially in the Japan story. The girl doesn't fit in. She wants a boy to like her. She misses her mother. The end. I'm also not a fan of the lengths at which the writer takes to link the three stories. The link between Morocco and Japan in particular is extremely thin. It seems like if the worst case scenario happened from every decision you made you might end up with a story like this. It's just not believable. It's also depressing. I don't think anything good happens in this. There's no scene that will make you crack a smile, whether it be the young Moroccan boy masturbating, a chicken having its head pulled off or a nanny being unfairly deported. I'm not a fan of movies which just depress you. And this movie, while ambitious, will do just that.I understand that I'm in the minority with my opinion on this, but so were 90% of the audience I saw it with.If you like your movies with a hint of tragedy, a pinch of unbelievability and a good handful of depression, then this is the movie for you.",Babel

The performances, especially Adrianna Barazza, are extremely wonderful, but more than that they are realistic, and provide a haunting look at the lives of the people. The movie itself is also very realistic, my only complaint is that I didn't feel as though Adrianna Barazza's story was as complex, and in depth as I felt it could definitely have been.Also, the score itself was worth seeing the movie for. Never in my life have I heard a score that was so appropriate and so compelling. The music was perfectly timed, and perfectly tuned.

491,MVBarra1,3/4 Great.,7,19 November 2006,"Babel is almost a great film. However only see this film if you are ready to think, and possibly get a little depressed.There are four story lines in this film that entangle in a very interesting way. I feel however that it would be a much more effective film if there were only three story lines. That is not because four is to many, its simply because only three of them really worked. The story lines that followed the Moroccan family, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, and the Mexican nanny and the kids were great. The story line that took place in Japan however did not work. It was totally unnecessary and took me out of the story every time it came up. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I did not understand the need for this story line. However, if you can sit through the unnecessary parts of the film and weed them out then it is quite a wonderful story.As for the acting there was not a weak performance in this movie. If you want to see a lot of really great work on the actors part then definitely see this movie. Brad Pitt breaks your heart. No weak performances but i think the stand out great performances in this are Brad Pitt, Adriana Barraza, and Gael Garcia Bernal.The cinematography in this movie was beautiful. They made full use of every landscape and backdrop they had available to them.A great movie overall.

And for most of the 142 minutes, I was inclined to agree. But the endings (and there are three) all seemed contrived and out of place. Is this movie the product of a focus group? It sure has that feeling. In the Japanese story, we have a suicide note, but no suicide. In the Mexican segment, we have the kids being found, but we only find out about it in a throw away line. In the Morocco story, the wife survives. Nothing bad (with the exception of the death of the child shooter in Morocco) happens in a movie careening towards disaster.

The plot is plodding, the cinematography is generic, even the music is barely noteworthy. A thin and less-than-intriguing connection to all the characters involved makes this less a movie than an exercise in patience. The unanswered questions (What was the difficulty in the marriage? What was in the note?) are hardly thought-provoking. It seems more of a pretentious affectation. There's no real payoff in this tripe, no real twist that makes it all seem worth the time you'll commit to this film. At the two hour mark, I was begging for an ending or death. I got neither.",Babel

Not only are the 4 story lines in this film incredible, but the visuals as well. Iñárritu is one of few directors who can keep an Anthology film so engaging.The acting is top-shelf as well. Adriana Barraza gives an outstanding performance as Amelia, the caring Mexican nanny. As does Rinko Kikuchi as the deaf-mute Japanese student, Chieko. Even Brad Pitt brings us a moving performance. Especially in the scene near the end of the film when he talks to his son on the phone and cannot hold back the tears.The film brings to us a subtle message that the viewers need to decipher for themselves. The message deals not with miscommunication, but with how people of the world are divided by our differences and how we look at others with differences, because maybe, we're not as different as we think. (Examples from the film: The way the Japanese kids treat Chieko because she cannot speak or hear. The fact that the American Government assumes that the shooting of the American Susan must be a terrorist attack when it was only 2 kids testing out their rifle. The way Santiago has no idea how to properly react to the Border Patrol's demands.)In the end, I will say, this has got to be one of the best movies I've seen this year.

The locations of the film were good as well. I did thought the scrambling of the stories was overused a bit too much. Overall i did liked it but I wasn't impress at all. So to wrap this up.

After seeing it, I enjoyed it, but was left feeling underwhelmed.The best parts of the film are easily Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi's roles. Of course neither of them are listed on the poster or in the trailers. If the film had been just Barraza's story, or Kikuchi's, or even both, I'd rank this much higher. The Morrocan family dealing with the shooting was good, but not as great as the aforementioned subplots.Which brings me to Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Love them both, but they were pretty useless in this. Without getting into spoilers, all I'll say is that in the grand scheme of things, the shooting ended up seeming really unimportant in comparison to ALL the other subplots. Maybe that was the point, but still. Meh.I do want to say that Adriana Barraza is one hell of an actress. Superb performance, and incredibly powerful.

Each was a short story that could have stood on their own and, had they been fleshed out, may very well have been more interesting and involving as separate entities. But as it was, from the opening moment you felt yourself on a slippery slope that would have no upturn, the film flashing from one part of the world to another leaving you with no chance to catch your breath. Halfway through I was ready for it to end.What saved the movie, in my opinion, was the acting, which was first rate and quite realistic, as well as the cinematography which was edgy without quite becoming pushy (though it was a close call.)I suspect it will remind many viewers of ""Crash"", as did me.

I haven't seen it again because the recollection is so powerful and I don't want to mess it up by seeing it again intentionally. The Mexican woman with the white kids in the desert has become part of my nightmares. What an enormous thing for a movie to accomplish. I'm giving it a 10 and not because I ""like"" the film so much but because I saw myself coming to the conclusion that the film is a masterpiece all on my own. It inspires respect. Christ! I can't believe I'm saying that but I am and I'm meaning every word. In a way it reminds me of Bunuel's ""Viridiana"" a film that I hated so much it has become one of the most important films of my life. Go figure. To be disturbed.

It's really just a boring version of Crash on a larger scale. It got so much press that I felt I had to see it. I think one reason I was underwhelmed was because it was so built up. The story about the Japanese girl was interesting, but I'm not really sure how it fit into the rest of the movie. It just seemed like it didn't have much to do with the other themes of the movie. The Brad Pitt part of the movie was very well acted and was definitely my favorite part. Unfortunately, the segment of the film centering around the children and their nanny was no where near as good. I'm also not really sure what the moral of that segment is. I suppose we're supposed to feel sorry for the nanny for getting in trouble, but she was incredibly irresponsible in taking the children to Mexico without parental permission so she deserved what she got. I also am getting tired of all these movies where several separate story lines are connected in the end. It was once considered innovative but it seems like 2 or 3 movies a year do it now so it's a cliché in and of itself. This wasn't a bad movie but there was nothing interesting or different about it. Crash was a far superior film with a similar theme and feel. If you want a movie like this get that one.",Babel

Despite its hype, it will eventually go down in history as one of the worst films ever. Really painful to watch and the opposite of what a movie should be. Boring, contrived and meaningless in spite of whatever unjustified praising you hear about it. Maybe a joke. I wonder why Brad Pitt was involved is such an awful project and therefore losing some of his well deserved credibility.

501,jambroman,pulled in - pushed: out how tragic can a film be?,7,16 July 2009,"OK, brilliant, but confusing, not only the non-linear shifts from one story to another - no need to repeat descriptions of the stories - but babel implies multiple voices all speaking at once, or does it? how well did we, audience, retain one story as we shifted to the next & again, was there a rhythm to the shifts, were we to view or think of one flowing into the other, or did the Jumpcuts move independently, albeit each moving towards a conclusion, each seemingly a foregone tragedy? how many ambiguities or contradictions wove together within each segment & among segments? did any one of the secondary segments - Tokyo flashing light & sounds of deafness; Mexican weddings & border crossing calamities all too common while driving ""brown"" or on foot, ""papers!"" demand armed uniformed men. Was the Moroccan segment the main event, or not, as it ended with rescue for the American amidst devastation & death for the ""natives"". was this entire film a contrast between power of developed economies & underdevelopment? babel concluded by tying together all segments into one story unfolding over time & space & in the end the winner was who? white Americans & Japanese, the losers: Mexican & Moroccan. the lonely figure of the Japanese detective in a bar, a TV flash of the stories resolution, existential, very much early Kurosawa, Pitt's phone call recycled from babel's opening scenes, a circle, conclusion? what was meant by revealing the American government paranoia, bumbling global reach & media hype? do Brad Pitt & Kate Blanchet share the director-writer's political view of global injustice enough to do a film that will not win them Hollywood box office kudos? all-in-all a film forcing more than inviting the audience to ponder deep questions, but powerful enough for us to turn our lenses on ourselves, meaning & emptiness in our own lives, lingering doubts, responses to fate that might fill such hollowness — sparks of light in our lives to illuminate the wasteland & despair — analogies with T.S. Elliot's well known poem "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men "" — despite the darkness, a film to review at least one more time, if not for enjoyment, then for uncovering deeper layers of meaning in all our lives.",Babel
502,damjanraknic,"Even in a connected world, not everyone is on the same page",7,1 July 2013,"Babel, once retold will undoubtedly sound like not much of a film, but take a moment to explore the undertones and pleasure can be found in watching. The four stories are shown to be connected but not in a way you might expect. Every person's choice in their story affects the other stories but those characters make further choices and that distances the causality factor, which makes this film worthy of storytelling exploration.Of the four stories, 3 are wonderfully connected, and without the fourth story (deaf-mute Japanese girl) this could have been an even better film. As is, it runs longer than it should but tempo is good, and almost 2 and a half hours whisk by in an instant. Technically the film is a marvel, as it looks and feels very dynamic, and this is a case where an unsteady camera works with the storytelling style. The camera work color-wise is also a standout, but some wonderful and very poignant editing can be observed as well.The acting is perhaps it's greatest strength, as Rinko Kikuchi, Adriana Barraza and the whole Moroccan ensemble are just stellar in this. I was especially impressed with Rinko, as she has a very difficult task of playing deaf-mute Chieko and does with such emotion that it's a marvel to behold. Babel is loaded with themes, most notably, family and communication (lack there of) and in this it succeeds, but the stories aren't loaded with content and thus we are privy to only segments. Like I said before, without the Japanese story, this film could have been fashioned into a worthy successor to Amorres Perros, but the inclusion of the Japanese segment dilutes the message of the whole film because it features only a loose connection with the rest.That said it's a very good film, and for fans of Inarritu and Arriaga it's a must.",Babel
503,Replikant,"Hard-hitting, moving and impressive. A movie that delivers",9,28 December 2006,"After Alejandro González Iñárritu put his name on the movie map with his brilliant ""Amores Perros"", he had to struggle with the problem various directors of brilliant debut features had to. How could he match this? While ""21 grams"" was still very good but not even in the same league, ""Babel"" seemed quite promising as a follow-up of epic proportions. Shot in different languages and in 4 different countries with some of the best/most famous actors of world cinema, it was clear he was looking for new challenges. And ""Babel"" is a movie that delivers on different levels.First of all you can clearly see the leitmotifs from his former works, such as the fate and destiny from ""Amores Perros"" and the guilt and religious motivation from all his works, while this time he wants to go even deeper.As the name implies, he expands his work with the different cultures and languages, as most of the struggles and problems develop from misunderstandings, racism, and communication problems (the use of a deaf protagonist in the Japanese part is both innovative and brilliantly converted). And his characters have to struggle a lot.He does not go easy on the viewer, the characters stumble from one rock-bottom to the next, get beaten up, mutilated, killed, and physically and emotionally hurt, but fortunately, it is not taken to the extremes but only to a certain, hard-hitting degree. Instead of exploiting their grief, the story switches to the next location/situation, leaving the viewer with a slight relief. (As a woman behind me mumbled at one point: ""This is NEARLY unbearable"") Technically and acting-wise the movie is flawless, effectively using the excellent camera-work of his former DOP Rodrigo Prieto to reflect the harsh reality while still looking beautiful and giving each part its own visual flair.Personally I would go for ""Amores Perros"" as I preferred the chaotic and emotionally filled energy that linked and fueled the different episodes, but ""Babel"" shows that Iñárritu grows and expands his skills without loosing his trademarks and impact. It is clearly a director's movie, and the motivations of the story are quite obvious, but it is managed in such a realistic and cinematic way that it does not lower the movie's value. Not an easy movie, but even more a stunning and hard-hitting perception of our world and of recent as well as universal problems and conflicts. Great world cinema.",Babel

Its annoying that every film that comes out which does this since Magnolia is apparently a masterpiece, but its not. Magnolia was a good film and original.

505,DxB_PiRaTe,Babel: Everyone Suffers. How to present a beautiful masterpiece without depending on dialogue!,8,4 March 2007,"A movie like no other I have seen before. I think Syriana tried to reach the point that Babel did but failed. Amazing performances by all of the cast, and great artistic look at the sufferings of different people around the globe. The movie is very touching and moody. The movie tells the story of 4 different stories that are interconnected by one incident, and by one idea. The movie was amazingly produced. Although the movie is abit slow and moody, once you watch the first 10 minutes of it, you get hooked up to it. The movie is not biased in any way, it actually looks at how people get mixed up in their stupidity and unrealistic actions which costs a lot to them and to others that they do not think they have any connection to. The story is very well presented and the editing is just awesome! The performances by the actors were also great. How each actor didn't have much screen time but they still showed talent. Especially Brad Pitt in the Phone scene in the end.. very nice! The movie does not depend on dialogue but more on the physical actions by the actors and the directing style of the talented director.The movie is very emotional and touches different part of everybody's life.. so everyone SHOULD watch it. Might not be the best movie of the year, but definitely one of the BEST!",Babel
506,Sarah22222222,"Bizarre, shocking but certainly intriguing.",7,9 September 2007,"Babel was pretty far from what I expected to be shown. If you are renting this film expecting two hours of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette then prepare to be surprised. For the majority of the film neither Pitt nor Blanchette grace our screens, instead, a host of unknowns in subtitled sub plots - but I do not state this negatively.The film focuses on four main stories which connect but not in a circular motion. It isn't in your typical linear form either, the sequence of events is varied throughout - the plot jumping back and forth between the separate stories.When I first watched this I had to step back and almost laugh at just how random it seemed to be. First of all I was watching young Morrocan boys shooting at Jackals, then Pitt and Blancette came into view, then a Mexican women caring for the children of Brad and Cate and finally a deaf mute Japanese girl's struggle with her disability and family life. Sounds like a lot to take in? Perhaps it was. Looking back I realise there were many untold stories within Babel: that of Richard and Susans dead child, the death (in greater depth) of Chieko's mother, the effect of Chieko's behaviour towards her dentist. On one side it feels as though we are bombarded with stories, on the other it is like we are dropping in on real life and only catching snippets - it is quite a natural film in this way.I found Chieko's story possibly the most interesting - especially how the noise and hustle bustle of the city is contrasted with the fact that her world is silent. Again in this story there was a lot of depth, her struggle as a teen and also as a deaf teen, her struggle with her mother's death her relationship with her father, her sexuality. This is possibly the most disturbing of the stories and some of the scenes I found to be quite shocking - her reaction to the boy turning her down over her disability was certainly unexpected! Basically it is a film about life's struggles, whether it be about poverty, family, race, religion, death - Babel depicts extreme cases in unusual ways. While the strings attaching one story to the next may not be the strongest there are deeper associations between the tales.Sorry about a rather disjointed and random review - but there you have a quick glimpse and a snippet of my opinion on Babel. It's worth a watch because a film like this is a rare occurrence. I can't say it will go down in my favourites but I'll certainly remember it. Perhaps I wasn't completely moved when I should of been or that I was too caught up in the other stories to feel sorrow but I didn't shed a tear when Yussaf was killed. However there were many times when I was completely engrossed in the film and barely noticed I was reading subtitles.I would recommend this, just because it is unique - yes it can be compared to Crash but still it is unusual and different. This is an adult film, not meant to be watched with the children at any costs! Rent it when you have the time to take it in and be warned that you'll spend a large percentage reading subtitles! An intriguing film not without faults but certainly very well acted, scripted and depicted.",Babel

When I went to see the film, I was slightly apprehensive. In fact it was 2 hours of sheer enjoyment. The film is three stories taking place far away from each other but linked: one in Mexico, one is Marocco and one in Japan.Those who did not like the film and/or did not understand it wrote spoiling reviews that reveal every thing in a boring way. All along the film, you know something wrong is going to happen to the characters but it is never what you expected! There is no fairy like happy ending but neither the tragic ending one thinks necessary for a great film. Despite what some critics said, the endings are 'natural'. I think it is also one of those films who make the spectator aware of the human condition of the others! The cinema, in general, has gone too far in sheer entertainment and nothing else. BABEL is entertainment and food for thought. All along I was asking myself "" Why?How?Where?Who?..No!Yes!!!! And the puzzle comes into place with the answers: sheer pleasure and mind broadening. Saying any more would ruin these unpredictable stories. Oh I forgot, the acting is outstanding. Ought to be seen on big screen to get maximum emotion.

511,legofrod,Chaos and Emancipation...,8,14 April 2010,"Babel – a mythical name which stands for confusion created by languages. And this can very well happen to you if you get a pirated copy of the movie. That's what I did, but thankfully, the confusion is minimal as most of the movie can be understood without knowing the languages (Arabian, Mexican, Japanese), which is saying a lot for any film.The story revolves around a rifle and the repercussions it makes, literally and figuratively. The concept is similar to that of The Butterfly Effect, but the way it is handled is more documentary-like. A Moroccan family buys a rifle to protect its herd of sheep from jackals. An estranged couple tries to come to terms with differences of opinion while vacationing in Morocco. Their kids are back in the U.S., under the care of a Mexican baby-sitter. A stray bullet hits the wife, and lives go haywire: The Moroccan siblings who played with the rifle learn the ""stress"" word. The American couple faces apathy from comrades; surprisingly, finds a comrade in a native; ironically, comes closer in strife. The baby-sitter, in for ""longer hours"", chooses to take the kids along with her to Mexico for her son's wedding, only to face border trouble on her way back. There is a fourth family, but more of it later.The director Alejandro Gonzalez has so brought out the performances that it does not seem at all that the actors are 'acting'. Be it the rugged Moroccan family or Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett or Rinko Kikuchi or Adriana Barazza, all emote so naturally as if one were witness to an actual event, and not watching a movie. A case in point is the scene where Yussef surrenders himself. You actually get a lump in your throat, what though you be a pachyderm, which I am. The cinematography is top-notch, the pathos of circumstances being aptly evinced by barren landscapes and vivid colours (mark, in particular, the shock of Amelia's red gown trailing down the earthy terrain dotted with green coppice). And the music: one significant aspect of a movie is the way a director uses sound. We see long stretches of scenes in the movie without one background score, and then we come across a 15-second strain of a guitar. The effect: brilliantly subtle. Of course, many scenes are such which are wholly traversed without one word being spoken, only the background music playing away. The effect: subtly relieving. No wonder, the movie won the Oscar for the best Original Score.So what goes wrong with the movie? Here comes the part of the fourth 'interwoven' story, that of the Japanese deaf-and-dumb girl, Cheiko. It would have been better to hive it off into a completely different film, rather than trying to construe a vague connection with the roots of the rifle. The sequence is touching, but it does not merit fusion, and definitely not the pedestal of the last scene. Other things too seem a little of a drag: the long dance sequence at the Mexican wedding, the 'drug effect' experienced by Cheiko One major irregularity with the film is the security-check problem faced by Amelia on the return journey. What about the onward journey? Didn't the police find it suspicious as to why two Mexicans had two American children on their way to Mexico? But these are aspects you can ignore when the 'whole' touches a nerve somewhere. And this film touches the finest nerve – that connecting the heart. And so it succeeds.",Babel
512,razvanu,stood up to my expectations,9,30 December 2006,"This movie is much like the director's other movies (21 Grams, Amores Peros). It also reminded me of Crash. Just like Crash, this movie looks at the way the lives of different people interact. The title Babel is also a great choice because it metaphors the boundaries of communication that often are of great importance in the film. Another thing I also liked about this movie was its degree of realism. It depicts reality at its harshest. It is a very serious movie, not for the seekers of cheap action or comedy entertainment (which is to be said about 21 Grams and the other movies I mentioned here). I am not saying this film is boring: far from it. But its quality does not come from action sequences but rather from the well depicted facets of human nature it reveals. If you liked Crash or 21 Grams, you will certainly appreciate this movie as well. I did not give this movie a 10 because I only give that to movies that manage to touch me in ways media rarely does (it's all very subjective): 9 out of 10.",Babel

God was angry of the people of Babylonia BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO EQUAL GOD'S POWER AND WILL.. God then made the people of Babylonia in a way so they can't understand each other. When they talked they talked differently and that made them unable to understand each other. This is said to be the reason why languages vary throughout the world. We're human beings.

514,docshaman,A story about people locked in miscommunication.,3,14 May 2007,"This is an interesting commentary on the interplay of characters supposedly surrounding a focal point. I think it was an anti-gun attempt, and underlying advocacy film for illegal aliens, but the plot does exactly the opposite of what it intended. If the film was supposed to appeal to our sympathy for the illegal alien, it certainly was amusing in the way the story line reversed that intent. When the Mexican nanny decides to travel to Mexico to attend her son's wedding, she abandons her responsibility to care for the American children in her care. The decision to relinquish her responsibility and place her charges at grave risk is a poor advertisement for hiring a nanny in the first place. If we view some of the decisions made in Mexico, we see a social class distinction somewhat different than middle class, or even general American values. This might be a good example of how ethnocentrism causes judgements based on one's values. The American couple is also a poor excuse for parents. They are too busy with their own self-pity and selfish needs to worry about their children who they leave with the illegal alien nanny. This is a good film for my sociology classes to watch because it shows the true nature of the illegal alien problem. You will have to watch the film to make up your mind what I mean by that. In any event, I am certainly not an advocate for illegal immigration. Part of this film supports my view. Aside from immigration issues, the movie also is a vague commentary on youth issues, so may also apply to juvenile justice as well. As with most films, there are many other references to basic sociological concepts.",Babel
515,Caitlin-7,How does such mediocrity get 7 Academy Nominations?,1,13 February 2007,"There are so many things wrong with this movie that I find it hard to understand the number of positive reviews. This is mediocrity trying to pass as an enlightened film on how we are all connected and the global consequences of our actions. Every parent in this film was beyond irresponsible and should have had their children taken away from them.I'm suppose to believe that a well-off American couple deserts their also grieving young children to go to Morocco for ""alone time"" to recover from the Sudden Infant Death of their youngest child (talk about the me generation)? That this couple would leave their kids alone for weeks with the nanny (an illegal immigrant, day care provider)? That's just one of the many far-fetched steps that are used to force this movie along.The shooting of Cate Blanchet's character was messed up. Where was the continuity manager for the movie? She was sitting on the driver's side of the bus, yet she was shot by a bullet fired from the opposite side of the bus. However, it is shown as if the bullet comes in her side of the window (this is cartoon physics where the bullet magically goes around the object). From the angle that the kid's fired the rifle, the bullet would have gone in the front or the front right. Based on where the bullet came in the bus, the local police should have been looking at the area on the left side of the bus, but they still managed to find the shell casings high on a hill in a large landscape of desert, in just a short time. This can only happen in a movie. She was hurt so badly that her husband, Brad Pitt (in yet another one-two note acting job) that he tried to keep the bus in the small town rather than trying to reach a hospital. Yet she was well enough to talk and move around some before the helicopter finally showed up many hours after she could have been at the hospital. Also, was it because they were Americans that the shooting was tagged immediately as a terrorist event? Would that have been the case if the Australians or Germans on the bus had been shot? This whole setup reeked of ""the ugly American"".If one believes the premise of this movie that all the characters are tied together by the rifle, then Chieko's mother, who committed suicide by shooting herself, probably did so with the ill-fated rifle because of incest between the father and daughter (implied in the final scenes of the movie). The father abandon's his daughter in her grief and goes to Morocco to shoot biggame (do they have any in Morocco) and leaves the rifle behind as a gift to his guide precipitating the events that bring all the families together. The guide sells the rifle to his friend for what seems like an extreme amount of money considering the circumstances in which they live.Once the kids have the rifle, they use it for what are the only believable sections of the movie. They are told to shoot jackals to protect the family's most important possession, the goat herd. Instead, being kids, they start shooting at rocks etc and aim at the bus because they don't believe the bullets can go that far. Then they hide the gun and act like typical kids who have screwed up.In the mean time, even with the mother having been shot and the father calling and telling the nanny (Amelia) to stay with the kids, she decides to take them to Mexico for her son's wedding in the car driven by her clearly irresponsible nephew. Instead of staying after the wedding for a reasonable time and letting the nephew sober up, they all get back in the car and end up in trouble at the border. Amelia then makes every imaginable mistake, putting herself and the kids in life threatening situations, only to end up deported and no longer able to see the kids she claims (strongly) to the border patrol, that she loves.This movie was an endless stream of improbable and impossible events meant to garner sympathy from the audience. It failed. Gael Garcia Bernal and Cate Blanchett, both of whom are outstanding actors, were wasted; anyone could have played their parts.If you want a movie that shows how actions have global consequences see ""Syriana"". If you want a movie that makes a statement, see ""Thank You For Smoking"". If you want an Indie film that will make you think, see anything by Charlie Kaufmann.",Babel

I respected AMORES PERROS and 21 GRAMS but neither really connected with me... So I was totally unprepared to be as impressed by this film as I was.I wasn't a fan of CRASH -- I thought it was an overly-simplified take on a complex issue and that the characters were drawn in cartoony, larger-than-life strokes. BABEL, for me, is the complete opposite: as dense and complicated as the current state of world relations (between countries, between strangers, between family members and friends), filled with complex characters who are never reduced to stereotype. The performances are uniformly excellent, from the non-actors to the unknowns (here in America, anyway) to Brad Pitt, Gael Garcia Bernal and Cate Blanchett (all of whom give completely unflashy, ensemble performances). And the technical film-making is astounding -- not just the direction, but on every front (the editing and the amazing score deserve particular attention).The most remarkable thing for me is the way director Inarritu and screenwriter Arriaga capture the different rhythms of life in Morocco, America, Tokyo and Mexico. Rather than using some kind of clear-cut stylistic device (like the color-coding in TRAFFIC), they establish the distinct flow and feel of each country early on and maintain it throughout the film. It's that kind of depth that makes BABEL such a unique mainstream film.My best advice is to go into this film with as few preconceptions as possible and enjoy an experience that's become increasingly rare since the heyday of the 1970s: an intelligent Hollywood film with something important on its mind.",Babel
518,SzymonBlachuta,Innaritu accuses modern society,9,18 February 2007,"A few weeks ago, I went to cinema with a big headache. During 21 Grams premiere a lot of critics accused Innaritu and Arriaga of copying their former ideas. To be honest, the movie had been smashed a long time before premiere. Fortunately they have committed a mistake!According to me, this movie is much more better that others Oscar's candidates. Innaritu is one of the obscure directors who directly hits a conscious of the Earth residents. He describes problems omitted by other artists. American young couple is a typical modern couple with lack of communication skills - they don't know how to talk, only way of communication is quarrel. They seems to be closer, when tragedy encounters them. Director skilfully captures 2nd heroes of this part - American tourists showing their ruthless behavior and omnipresent rudeness. Next teasing issue is our lost in modern times. Chinko suffering from her mother's death, can't rely on father's support. Illnes and peers pressure damage her definition of love and narrow down it into occasional sexual contact. Her outrageous behavior is a method of searching warmth she can't receive. Fortunately, she founds person who is able to change her point of view and prevent her form sharing her mother's fate. Rest stories can be treat as different category. Innaritu show how quickly and pointlessly we can loose important things. The things for whose we have been working all life. From small, innocent events are born tragedies having tragical effects on our life. Small incident may ruin whole life.The rope connecting America, Asia and Africa, backs up our throats...Babel is a movie rejected by many viewers whose problems are described brutally by director.

But what tied it all together, this interwoven collection of stories set in 4 locales with 5 systems of language? The concept of karma? Anti-gun sentiment? Human pain and its lessening through love and contrition? The contrast between the various settings was as huge as the similarity of the human emotions felt by the characters in each setting. We are all one, so why can't we all just get along? Maybe that's the theme, and it is a worthy one, especially when told in such a visually luscious manner.",Babel

All of it its really well done, the name Babel really goes with the movie and it should pass to the story. The actors were great, each one in their own characters, and there are a lot of characters, some really complex and some simple but still great.The chaos is present all along the movie and it shows you how so many different people and so many different countries can be affected by a misunderstood fact like a shot. Along the movie, the scenes change a lot of place and also time, that's the greatness of the director and the script, and every change is perfectly done, even the music and the sounds are great. I hope you all go to see it cause it deserve 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time, every story is beautiful, and at the end is related to the others.

524,phil-1119,"Lured by the title and its cast, here's a loose ended movie about nothing.",1,12 November 2006,"Want to be mislead into thinking you're about to see a great movie on the clash of cultures? Enter Babel.Taken under the wings of Hollywood's altermondialists, who hope to score points in their quest to denounce the rising barriers between countries/cultures, Inarritu wastes 2h30 of your time to show you a series of loosely connected and predictable events triggered by idiotic characters who get what they deserve.Why is this such a disappointment? After all, showing idiots get in trouble on the screen usually works! It doesn't work here because you'd think the clash of cultures and the language barriers is the cause of all the problems that occur in the movie when in fact, it's nothing like that. The characters get in trouble because of their complete lack of logic and the authorities actually act accordingly to minimize the damage.I think Inarritu wants us to be more sympathetic to the cause of complete imbeciles vs. officials abusing their powers against ""poor and innocent people""  none of which are not portrayed in this movie.Case in point: a/ The clash between the drunk Mexican and the US customs agent would have been just the same had the drunk been a Texan red neck. I'm even surprised Inarritu shows us how ""understanding"" the US agents are by accepting to look for the kids the next day. You'd think, as a good left-wing, anti-establishment activist that they'd have arrested the maid, not trusted a single word she said and left the kids to die in the desert! b/ The clash between the American tourists and the locals in Morocco would have been just as bad between Moroccans. Proof of that is the local tour guide is no better -he's actually worse- at getting help than Brad Pitt  who delivers a pathetic and predictable performance. Next, the police find the culprits in less time than it takes to say ""shoot"", by moderately roughing up the locals - which is not shocking given the severity of the event and if you've seen what it's like in Morocco.So what is he trying to say? That the police were effective? That the US government did a good job? Finally, the link between the Japanese family and the rest of the film.... well you just have to see it to believe it: I've never seen such loosely connected stories in the same film. Not only are they loosely connected, but they don't even come together at the end of the movie - something Inarritu had managed quite well in Amores Peros.Maybe if he'd gone through the trouble of telling us the parallel story of the Russian or Israeli factory worker who built the bullet used to shoot the tourist, we'd have had another 30mn or 45mn of lame and useless storytelling.I was caught once with Y tu Mama Tambien, thinking Gael García Bernal who'd done such a good job in Amores Peros would bring us another good story - which ended up being about jerking off at the pool and swearing for absolutely no reason for 1h30  something my Mexican and Colombian friends were ashamed off (and they were not raised with a silver spoon in their mouth). I was caught yet again with Babel, mislead by the title, by the producer, by its cast and by the fact that it had been a favorite in Cannes, Toronto and other film festivals.Such movies are usually favorites because they want to denounce the establishment and we all know the social penchant of artists and movie critics  that's fine. Except this movie fails on all aspects it tackles!!! Independent movie-goers: Don't drew because a movie is simply off the beaten path; don't fall in love or get all sympathetic because you see a bunch of peasants get beaten up by police, just because you don't like Bush  it happens everyday and it's been like this since the dawn of men.There are limits to abusing one's good faith and this director does just that for 2h30. He takes you on an empty ride, with an empty story, empty characters and worst of all a fully predictable plot from the moment you realize you've been conned into seeing a movie not worth the film it's printed on.",Babel

Four stories linked by a Winchester rifle and a single incident on three continents.Brad played a fifty year old man and trying to address problems in his marriage gave a performance that must make him think about becoming more of a serious actor.

Like what would happen if an animal crossed the road and you would fall from the cliff. What would happen to your kids? How about if the babysitter at the same time choked on her lunch to death? Would not this be terrible? How about if the kids swallowed some sorta poison at the same time? This sort of scenario is at the center of this movie. The kind that makes ppl buy life insurance. I kept catching myself asking while watching this movie: ""Why the hell did you just do that?"" No person in their right mind, even 8-9 year old would be insane enough to do the stuff they do there. I found that the main features of the film that moved me were not the superb acting (the best work of Brad Pitt IMHO; the rest of the cast performed up to their platinum standards), directing, cinematography, etc., etc., but the disturbing coincidence of freak accidents that befall the heroes. It looked like an old vaudeville story to me: all the hell breaks loose in the beginning, kids suffer, which is supposed to evoke emotional response in the sensitive part of the audience (my wife). Bottom line: scenario was micromanaged fine, with unbreakable storyline and uniform pace, grabbing attention of the viewer at each point. The general idea of the movie is missing/was not communicated which leaves you empty but for some emotional stress. Different parts of the story are in general left poorly connected. In many cases its obvious that they are just trying to push some buttons in the audience, like miserable kids stories, which leaves even worse impression. PLEASE DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIESome obvious flaws in script are as follows:1) Hunting in Sahara desert? Maybe some lizards or locals' camels? 2) There are deaf people. Their life is miserable. And your point is  3)Timing of different events is mismanaged. Brad Pitt was supposed to return from the middle of Sahara to baby-sit in <1 day before Mexican lady attends her son's wedding? This is if nothing had happened. Its impossible. They must have had some plan for that.4) The content of the note of the Japanese girl is not revealed. If it were a suicide note, why did not policeman react in any way when he read it?",Babel
528,dgwfriend,Will we ever just get along?,8,4 February 2007,"So in the Bible the story goes that after the Flood, once they'd all dried off, the remainder of mankind tried to build a shortcut to heaven - Babel's Tower. It probably seemed like a good idea at the time but God, although generally seen as stand-up kind of guy, does have something of a temper on him and was less than impressed by the lack of Heavenly planning permission. As punishment for the attempted intrusion he scattered Man around the world and made everyone speak different languages. That way, it would be that much harder for anyone to come together and attempt such a feat of architecture again. And so, a couple of millennia later, we're where we are today, living in a world of disparate tongues and cultures.In Babel, director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu takes a long hard look at the differences between our cultures, how they've shaped the world we live in and, perhaps more importantly, how they've been exploited by mankind, and especially our politicians. The question is, are the differences destroying us, or can our common humanity overcome the barriers that apparently divide us? The film, without ever being clichéd or patronising has a fair crack at offering up an answer. It weaves together a series of tales bound by a solitary gesture. A chain of events is triggered affecting the lives of families spread as far a field as Morocco, the US, Mexico and Japan. Now, there are those who argue that the link between the story lines is a little too coincidental but it's difficult to agree with that criticism. Babel is a great example (albeit to the extreme) of cause and effect, of how the decisions each of us make can have an impact on the world at large.While it boasts a cast including Hollywood luminaries such as Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, it's the lesser known supporting actors who help to make Babel so good. Rinko Kikuchi is utterly captivating as an emotionally troubled deaf mute battling to emerge from adolescence and find acceptance in a noisy, fast-talking Japan, while Adriana Barraza excels as a Mexican nanny having to deal with the pitfalls of US immigration policy. Difficult subjects are tackled throughout making it often uncomfortable and sometimes disturbing viewing. But because of that, not despite of it, it deserves to be seen. It's superbly shot, the soundtrack is tremendously effective, and the acting, across the board, is superb. Okay, if you want a film to relax in front of on a lazy Sunday afternoon, then Babel probably isn't it. But if you're after a thoughtful, intelligently provocative piece of film-making that makes you question the world we live in then you can't go far wrong, whatever language you speak.",Babel

530,mr-giroro,A Definition of an Over-Hyped Film,5,7 March 2009,"There was much buzz about this film, and I've been wanting to watch this movie for a while. As a movie fan, I actually felt ashamed that I didn't watch this ""supposed-to-be-a-great-movie"" sooner. I finally had a chance to redeem myself last week when my friend came over to my place with this movie. Naturally, I began to watch this movie with great anticipation.The first part of the movie was good. The stories that unfold in 4 continents were very intriguing. It was thought-provoking, and made me constantly think about how all the stories would come together at the end. The cinematography was also beautiful and the acting was not bad at all. Even Brad Pitt was tolerable in this movie, which is not usual.However, after about 1/2 way through the movie, it began to fall apart. All the tension in the movie began to disappear, and the story became very incoherent. I expected that the 4 stories being told would coherently come together in the end, and give us a conclusion. But in the end, they were just random stories that are very loosely connected among one another. There are some connections--i.e., the rifle given away to a Moroccan by a Japanese hunter was used in the shooting of an American tourist, and this made the Mexican nanny of the American family make a bad decision of taking kids to Mexico. But this is it.I guess the message that the director tried to send us is that everyone in this world is more closely interconnected than we think, and that the actions we do can influence others. This is an important message, but the director has miserably failed to send this message effectively.In the end, this is one of the movies that are like King's clothes. Everyone can clearly see that the king does not wear any clothes, but people complement on his clothes because he is ""supposed"" to be wearing good clothes. This movie does not have anything in it, but people praise it because it is an artist movie and it should have something in it.This is not a good movie by any standard. Oh, did I mention that it is absolutely painful to watch a 40-year old actress in high-school uniform?",Babel

It is evident that best films can still be produced using a good story plot and a clear, non-bombastic screenplay. Babel is a good example for the above statement. I think music gave its best hand to handle the emotions of this film more perfectly. Gustavo Santaolalla's play with the music gives us extra dimensions to the scenes. Speaking about acting all has performed their best! I would appreciate the character called 'AMELIA' performed by Adriana Barazza, who out stood among all others performance. The character of Cheiko is being justified subtly. The non-professional actors Boubker Ait El Caid as Yussef and Said Tarchani as Ahmed in the Morocco sequence gave their naturalism to their characters. Guillermo Arriaga's Story and screenplay makes him to look like an artist, who makes a painting by working on several colors, layers, brushes, finally to yield a fine artwork! Similarly Guillermo too stood high by this film. My wishes!!!!",Babel

Two young goat herders in Morocco shooting at random wondering how far the bullet will travel. All four of these stories of parents and children coming together, what do they mean? Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, are interpreting the concept of Babel to the way we live now. In our daily lives we are threatened by terrorism.

But, hang in there and you will be rewarded.Brad Pitt is an actor you have not seen before. Tough, gritty and at the same time loving. Cate Blanchette has a role that requires little speech but more expression. The two goat herders and their families live quiet lives. The Japanese father is recovering from the suicide of his wife.

The fear of all is common to us all. The poverty is felt by many and recognized by few. The violence is an everyday part of life. The isolation that we feel from one another.

The dirty, noisy desert of Mexico and the quiet desert of Morocco. We will ruminate about this film and its meaning. We will discuss with friends and family.

And they could have done that if they had cut the entire Tokyo story which was completely unnecessary to get the point whole ""we fail to communicate"" theme across. It just took up screen time and the film would have been better if they hadn't explained where the rifle came from further back than the guy who sold it to Yussef's father. The deaf girl was over the top to get the theme across and I really didn't need to see her sexual frustration for 30 minutes of this movie. It dragged. Her father gave the rifle to the guy who sold it to Yussef's father. Seriously? They couldn't think of a stronger connection?And it was boring. This film has some serious pacing issues. It almost became a chore to continue watching.The scene where Susan and Richard kiss and make up. Weird.

The four different families, four different cultures, four different stories, held my attention, and moved along well. But after that first hour a sense of tedium set in as we sensed how the stories would be connected and how they'd end. At some point I fast-forwarded the DVD because the editor seemed trapped in his own sense of timing and awed by his director's brilliance, rather than in paying attention to storytelling.Furthermore, the Japanese component felt entirely disjointed. That rifle could just as easily (and more convincingly) ended up in the Morrocan's hands through Pitt's largess (he'd been on a trip there before and wanted to show his pissy wife the place he'd hunted), and just think how much tighter and more meaningful the story would have been. And shorter, so as to allow us to care about the characters instead of seeing them as cameos.All in all, a promising effort that failed to deliver a strong and sound story.",Babel
535,Feelgood_rev,"Powerful, moving, and easily one of the best of 2006",9,20 February 2007,"I've been looking forward to seeing Babel for some time now, and today I finally had the chance. I had read a few reviews on the film before renting it and they all seemed to be rather mediocre, surprising for a film that's nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. After watching this powerful film I can say that it rightfully deserves those nominations.The way Alejandro González Iñárritu sets up his story is both fascinating and essential in what we as an audience take away from it. Many reviewers have falsely compared this to last year's Best Picture winner, Crash. Let me put it out there and say that Babel is far superior to Crash and much more complex in both plot and cinematography. While Crash preached to us almost in a condescending way, Babel raises questions and never gives us answers. A trait which would be considered a negative aspect for most films actually helps this film to be the great success that it is.Babel centers around an American tourist who is shot in the middle of the Morrocan desert. This creates a world wide frenzy, and is what connects our 4 story lines. However, Babel isn't simply about how one event can effect the world. It goes beyond that in saying how we are all connected through human emotion, and that while we are separated through language and continents we still are all human. It touches on ideas of social racism, but never once does it lecture us as an audience. As the stories unfold, we gain not only an awareness to the world we live in, but we grow emotionally connected to the brilliant characters Alejandro has laid out for us.Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi have without a doubt earned their respected nominations, and deliver two of the most touching performances I've seen all year. The imagery the movie creates is astonishing. The gorgeous score, which played for more than 1/3 of the film, is perfect in every sense and was nothing but beneficial to an already great piece of art. Comparing this film to the other nominees is almost impossible, because it is truly in a league of its own. And while Babel isn't necessarily original in idea (neither are the other 4 nominees), it is original in execution and stands out as one of the finest films of 2006.",Babel

537,newartz,The unity of humanity,10,8 September 2007,"I took a while to finally watch this movie, because I sensed it would be something I would need to be open to understand. All the previous posts have basically given a synopsis of plot, and the story in itself was as complex as the condition of humanity on our planet and as simple as the consequences of our mistakes. What struck me most about the movie, which I wasn't expecting, was the deep intimacy revealed in the lives of the characters. Their were brief moments where the sexual humanity of so many of the characters revealed the blood rushing from their hearts through their veins. This wasn't some Hollywood exploitation of the audience, trying to get us ""turned on"", but rather it exposed the vulnerable yearnings of humans living on an earth so devoid of answers to the complex questions, which even the least ""civilized"" of us understand when our lives turn awry. These were sensitively and subtly nuanced scenes, yet gritty earthy scenes: scenes of the young Moroccan exchanging lust with his sister, the romantic rendezvous of a past love between the Mexican nanny and a man from her past at the wedding, and, of course the furtive yearning of the Japanese teenage girl to attract the love she needed. And even the biological intimacy revealed between the American couple when she needed to relieve herself. These were portrayed with such real innocence, and the textured reality of the entire film caused me to find a personal connection with each to the characters, not on the basis who how they were different than I, but how our humanness was common.This is what was brilliant. We are all humans wanting life, but we are such fools that the least mistake in seeking more pleasure from life can destroy it.All the acting was brilliant, all the music was perfect, all the photography was energized with a texture that absorbed the cultures represented and conveyed them to the soul with a painful immediacy. The story in itself was so simple, but the reality behind it is so complex. We as human beings have not become a species who knows how to love beyond the boundaries of our own selfishness, and from this isolation, we forget that there are lives in a bus, that bullets will kill, but that strangers can care, and our own perceptions of a situation are never what our preconceptions tell us. Most of all this film revealed that human love for all its joy, still gives us our greatest pain simply because our cultures have yet to find the way to share it.I look forward to more films like this, but, alas, they have been and will be, rare.",Babel
538,lmaldarella,Babel,10,18 September 2016,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is the greatest director and filmmaker of the 21st Century. Without fail, every single entry into his portfolio of masterpieces ranging from 'Amores Perros' to 'The Revenant', has only reinforced that fact in my mind.Following in the steps of two of his previous works, 'Amores Perros' and '21 Grams', Inarritu's 2006 masterpiece 'Babel' serves as the powerful culmination of his trilogy of multiple interlocked narrative films.Paul Haggis's 'Crash' made a close second behind Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' for the best picture of 2004, but 'Babel' is not only the best of 2006 by a long shot, it is the best picture of the 2000- 2010 decade because Inarritu's flawless direction along with his vision for film and characters paired with his and Guillermo Arriaga's personable and impeccable script create a film that effortlessly connects to the emotion and spirit of the viewer. 'Crash' was an emotionally effective film, Haggis knew this, but he had to force it to be. The film revolved around extreme and everyday cases of racism and prejudice that culminated in tragedy. Emotional manipulation was the name of the game. That is not to say manipulation discounts the film or in any way decreases its value. A director who knows how to force the audience into certain reactions, whether they be emotions or fear, is a director with skill. We don't have to look back far to remember Hitchcock admitting that he was not directing the cast in 'Psycho', he was directing the audience, ""playing them like an organ."" And 'Psycho' is no small feat of cinema. The difference between Haggis and Inarritu begins where the manipulation ends. Inarritu is not forcing anything upon the audience. His characters are not MacGuffins, their dialogue is not engineered as a mere plot device. We are presented with true, living and breathing characters in 'Babel'. They act and behave just as we would in similar situations. Plastic characters are unheard of in the world of Inarritu cinema. Real, raw humanity abounds and it is most to be admired.At the onset of the film, we're presented with a home in the Moroccan desert where a man sells another man his hunting rifle. What appears to be an isolated event is soon revealed, through masterful structuring of events paired with stunning cinematography and editing, to be quite the opposite of isolated. 'Babel' is the combination of four stories that are ultimately revealed to be one, spanning four countries, sharing one overarching and powerful theme. Unlike other films in this genre, we are introduced very early to some of the connections between the different stories. Throughout the film, connection after connection after connection appear in sudden, often unexpected, and emotionally affecting ways. Throughout the subsequent scenes, we are introduced to an American couple on a trip in Morocco, the couple's children at their home in San Diego with their Mexican nanny, and a deaf teenage girl in Japan.This is Inarritu's most powerful and best film. Comparable to Asghar Farhadi's 'A Separation' in its portrayal of raw humanity, 'Babel' connects with the viewer in a way very few films can. By the end of the film, we find ourselves empathizing with every single character, a feat few can achieve. The brutal Moroccan police officers are just doing their jobs, whether we like it or not; Susan and the others are deathly afraid of the small Moroccan village, just as you and I would be; the Border Patrol is doing the right thing, they do not know the story as we do. Try as we may, we can find sympathy for every human reaction, justified by reason or not, in this film.The word Babel is a reference to the biblical tale of the confusion of languages detailed in the book of Genesis. Resembling this tale, 'Babel' shows the sad and damaging affects of misconceptions, assumptions, and faithlessness. The film is about communication. It is about cultural assumptions, and how humanity, compassion, and the most basic human instinct of all time, love, transcend language, culture, race, fear and insecurity, and brings about true, loving human decency and connection. This film is effective because Inarritu's characters are human beings. They are not the fearless heroes in modern-day adventures. These people are ordinary humans brought together by extraordinary (although feasible) circumstances and through their barriers, connected by their one shared feature: humanity.",Babel

Then in spite of the injuries the US embassy is unwilling to immediately provide assistance, (hurricane Katrina anyone). In the end of this little cliffhanger the kindly and extremely poor Arabs refuse to even take money from Brad Pitt for their assistance, how noble.Tying into this story is Brad Pitt's children which are left in the care of their saintly illegal alien caretaker. Their bond is so strong that she speaks to them in Spanish and they understand every word. Through another series of mishaps she ends up stranded in the dessert with the two children due to the repulsive and bullying border patrol. How dare they question people coming into our country! When its learned that she is there illegally she is deported. Heartless! and she rents a house and all her stuff is there. What is the world coming too. People not able to live illegally wherever they want.The third story is the only one that didn't have a clear anti-American theme which is that of a girl trying to deal with the grief of her mothers suicide and fathers alienation by trying to get it on with every male she comes across. To make her more sympathetic the character is also deaf.This movie is a ripoff of crash in every sense of the word. Whether people liked crash or not is irrelevant, the point is its a ripoff. Not original at all. The underlying theme is clearly that of Anti-American sentiment. The acting was extremely good, the plot contrived and it was about an hour too long. In addition I am getting tired of listening to the movie industry pontificate about this country. Solid debate or opinion that expresses both sides of an issue is healthy, one sided rhetoric designed to influence the thinking of the average empty headed movie goer is not.",Babel
541,Kgelderman,I just can't decide,5,16 February 2007,"Part of me loves this movie, while the other part of me simply hates it. Perhaps that is what makes an excellent film. I left the theater, and for days, all I could think about was the unifying theme. What was it? Why was I supposed to care? I saw the movie three months ago, so clearly it still affects me. And I still can't let go of the questions.I know one thing. This film isn't anywhere near as good as The Departed and Little Miss Sunshine. But I do think it had some merit. Amelia and Chieko's stories were heart-wrenching, and in my mind, contained some of the best acting of the year. Kikuchi and Barraza were raw and real, and deserving of their nominations. Pitt and Blanchett left much to be desired. I simply didn't care about them that way I did the others. At first I thought that might have been the intention of the director, now I think their parts were simply overwrought, as was much of the film. I think critics have mistaken this film for Oscar worthy because it's different. The problem is, it's not all that different. It's been done, and it's been done much better. Crash, good, but not great, Traffic, excellent, and Pulp Fiction, simply sublime, are all perfect examples. I think people think they're supposed to like Babel because of the many issues it ""brings to light."" In fact, I actually feel badly only half loving it. The truth is, however, it only accomplishes what's already been accomplished in other films, and it doesn't do it better. It simply does it. Everyone should see it, though. I need more people to talk about it with.",Babel
542,XIN1994,what to grasp in chaos of life?,7,11 July 2019,"The framework of Babel displays an interesting theme: different people's life are interrelated and mutually affected. Through presenting four different stories, which seem to be quite far away from each other as Alejandro sets the backgrounds separately in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and America, however they are entangled with each other. Which leads me to think how much of our own life is a result of other people's life or, in other words, is an outcome of other people's actions.I admire Alejandro's structuring ability to mix diverse materials without letting audiences noticing the sharp turning. While American couple, Morocco family and Mexican nanny's life all turned over within one minute, one hour or one night, Japanese girl's life is a presentation of the traumatic past, the unsatisfying present and the future. But have I noticed these different paces at the beginning? Not at all. This also attributes to fascinating musical works from Gustavo Santaolalla, which builds a smooth mood foundation for us to digest these dramatic life events.Then let's have a look on the stories. They narrate some tragedies and traumatic events, which is so baffling to me, as there are causes behind causes and is there a person to blame? Maybe or maybe not. What about a family, or a government. To me, it really comes to a dilemma that there's no one or nothing to blame while people struggle. Here, I don't have enough knowledge to talk about the story of the tower of Babel, but try to get a glimpse of a common path of the stories in the film. It could be sensed that there are risk factors beforehand of every storyline. So does this mean people should improve their alertness, like going to another country for travel, then do we need to prepare vigorously knowing the culture or the politics there. In one way, as a person, I don't think most people have this capacity to alert of all the potential danger. Though this kind of risk analysis could help prevent some tragedies like letting children use a gun, working illegally in another country and being as a disabled person in society. Also things like getting shot in a tourist bus is not a thing that we really should be prepared for in a normal circumstance.In the film, except American family's presented crisis got sorted out, other characters' life are still a mess, though in a process. At least we could find out that family as an important protective factor for Amelia and Chieko. So I came up with the question, but still couldn't find the very satisfying answer, though here it's important for me to say the power of family. There have to be something else, doesn't it?",Babel
543,subhacom,A bewildering picture of the human condition,9,12 January 2007,"This is a story that reminds one of Sartre's style of parallel story lines. The events take place in three regions over the globe. The characters and events are connected by thin threads which are created by most strange twists of chance. The name of the movie is a connotation of the story of the Tower of Babel:""...Therefore is the name of it called Babel (confusion); because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth...""Genesis 11:9The movie shows the first world and the third world close together, the pains and the hardships of both. And at the same time it involves two generations. The thread of events fires up from a child's misdeed and goes on with well-intentded actions that lead to disaster and suffering. And the root of all these lies in the failure of people to understand each other. The communication gap is sometimes due to a difference in language, sometimes because of a difference in culture, sometimes due to difference in economic condition and sometimes because of difference in age and at times because of sheer selfishness.Though finally the confusions are settled, one cannot help noting that the movie ends with a note of hope and reunion for the first world while the poor people have to just accept their loss!!The switching between the parallel worlds is well timed and full of significance. And the way the audience is made to share the world of a deaf and mute Japanese girl is very clever. All in all, this is one of those movies that make one think, and leaves a lasing impression!!",Babel
544,csarda1,Awful garbage disguised as Art.,1,23 March 2007,"The little respect I had left for Hollywood is gone.This is the most absurd, empty, exploitative, stupid, manipulative and ridiculously overrated piece of crap I've ever had the disgrace to watch.An homage to poor storytelling. Boring, irrelevant stories loosely connected. There is not the slightest resemblance with the reality Inarritu is trying to resemble. Just a series of absurd, unfortunate, unexplained, boring and UNRELATED events caused either by stupidity, sheer negligence or absolute absence of common sense Are we supposed to feel compassion for extreme idiocy or moronic irresponsibility ??? Let's Start with the Plot holes:WARNING!! SPOILERS!!There is no Ambulances, Doctors, nurses, even a Band Aid or Alcohol in Morocco.A TOURIST BUS touring in the middle of nowhere and they didn't carry an stupid first Aid kit or Emergency supply!!! (You can find BASIC medical help even in the Arctic) But......they have the best, fastest and more efficient POLICE on the Planet!!!! They got to the Crime scene in SEVERAL fast 4X4 SUVs, found an UNREGISTERED weapon's owner (It was a gift from a Japanese Hunter( In Morocco??) to an ignorant, dirty and primitive Shepperd) in a remote, poor rural and unpopulated zone, with almost no evidence and......in in matter of few hours they found the ""terrorists"".ButThey couldn't contact, talk or actually see the VICTIM, Not to mention they couldn't send a stupid Ambulance or a nurse to assist the main protagonist of the ""HYPER RELEVANT TERRORIST THREAT"" :THE VICTIM!! And How did the Moroccan Government now a Crime was committed if they even didn't see the VICTIM???? And the Moronic Husband, for some absurd reasons, choose to place his mortally wounded wife in some dirty pigsty with strange people, smoking some kind of Arabic Dope (oohh!! That strange people) in some lost town in the Desert rather than resume the trip on the Bus and seek Help.Why this idiot is holding the Bus while he waits for help is a mystery.What's the point of this absurd tale?? What's happening between that couple?? How did they end??What relevance had this stupid story???Oohh!!The Illegal (YES, is, ILLEGAL ) Mexican Nanny, who deeeeeeeeeply loves the American children she cares since they were born, but didn't hesitate to take them out to Mexisco for his son's wedding without permission of their parents and, later, coming back to the U.S. in a car with the drunken cousin driver and the two children, crossing the U.S. Border point of surveillance in the middle of the night!!Only a retard or a seriously mentally sick person would do that. This is plain unbelievable.For some stupid reason, She couldn't wait till the next morning, or at least for the cousin to sober up or ask one of the 100 relatives she was with to spend the night there or to drive Her back.She chose to risk her life (and the children's lives) instead.To worsen the things the drunken retard Cousin, at the first sign of trouble, ran away from the Border Patrol and had the BRIGHT idea of ABANDONING HER AUNT AND THE TWO CHILDREN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT WITH A FLASHLIGHT!! OOHH!A father giving to children (not even teens!) a high power rifle and leaving them on their own.Please...Imagine saying this to your 9 year old ""Hey Son, take my loaded Magnum and go out to play"" Not only are the stupidest decisions I've ever seen (even in a fictional movie) but CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT and punishable by law.Am I supposed to feel sorry for such an incredibly idiotic act of sheer stupidity and negligence??The deaf Japanese Girl behaves more like a nymphomaniac retard rather than a vulnerable, emotionally troubled girl.What's wrong with this girl?Are Deaf Japanese Girls also retards or so desperately love hungry they would get laid with ANYONE,??What's wrong with his father?What's the trouble, the profound story behind?And the frontal nude scene of a starved Japanese teenager is totally unnecessary. Inarritu could have said the same (that is NOTHING) without this pathetic scene. Also the 9 year old moroccan child masturbating and the Hen killing.Inarritu must be laughing in secret with Arriaga at the artsy fartsy snobs who liked this farce and nominated him for awards.",Babel
545,laura-bingham1975,One of my Favourite films for 2006,9,5 December 2006,"Babel is wonderfully scripted and directed. As in his previous films, ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams"", Inarritu had me spinning fast into an emotionally labile state, at times screaming in fury for justice, other times wallowing in the tragedy of life.This film is similar in construction to Inarritu's other films, in that each sub-plot is presented out of chronological order with subtle hints as to the connections between the various characters. I found the themes and the pace similar to that of this year's Oscar winner, ""Crash"". If you enjoyed ""Crash"", you will be touched by ""Babel"".In the biblical story, the tower of Babel was a construction failure simply because its thousands of builders spoke different languages and failed to understand each other. Whether one believes in the bible or not, this parable holds true today. Befittingly, this film speaks a number of languages and explores several cultures. There is English, Arabic, Japanese, Mexican Spanish and some very expressive and emotional sign language. There are scenes set in the US, Mexico, Morocco and Japan. As its name suggests, ""Babel"" delivers a powerful message, nothing new, but one that needs to raise our attention over and over again, lest we become complacent. This message is in the form of questions. Do we really understand each other? And how many misconceptions do we hold about one another? And how many of these misconceptions cause us to behave in the way we do? And is this behaviour destructive? Sadly, many times, it is.It is so easy to feel furious about the injustices portrayed in this film. They are a reflection of our world today. Take Emilia (a superb performance by Adriana Barraza who had me in tears). Throughout the film, we see this pure hearted, fully humane woman stretching herself to please everyone dear to her, whether that means, the children in her care, or their parents who have imposed this short notice charge on her (and who are currently stranded in a Moroccan village), or her family in Mexico. When Emilia makes a decision to cross the border to Mexico to attend an important wedding, the events spiral into her demise. Here, the US border security officers are represented as merciless and highly suspicious of incoming traffic. In their eyes, Emilia is a pathetic illegal migrant and she has broken the trust of the children. ""How could she leave them?"" asks one of the officers. He sounds utterly disgusted and the point of view shot he has of this woman seems strangely so different from ours. Because we've seen it all. We know Emilia and we understand everything. We know exactly why she left them alone. But who will tell? What other unspoken truth exists? Like the little Moroccan boy who makes a terrible mistake and whose silence has catastrophic results. Here, Babel explores how an accident involving two US tourists is attributed to terrible forces by the western world and especially its media. The resulting fear, prejudice and racism depicted in Babel are reminiscent of the current war-on-terror ambiance in which we find ourselves today, much to our regret. Once again, the audience knows the truth about the little village boy. But who will tell? In the spiralling denouement, we are left with dreamlike aerial visions of a Moroccan village glowing in the moonlight. In this scene, the melancholic guitar notes breathe softly of Andalusia and are wonderfully soothing. We watch village men, women and children gazing up towards the sky at the departing Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett). We are witness to the exemplary Arab hospitality, which sees abjectly poor people give all they have to strangers with no wish for repayment. We are witness to their concern for this foreign woman whose life they hoped to save and who may or may not speak the truth about them. In this magically evocative scene, a culture so far, and so unknown from ours is wonderfully portrayed. It is as if our veil of ignorance is removed by this film, allowing the audience to see more clearly into an otherwise opaque world. And then, there is the abrupt, landing. The landing into a better known reality. The US couple is now safe, on a city hospital helipad, with the buzzing Western media surrounding them and already pulsating with their own corrupt visions of truth. Who will tell? Last but not least, Babel explores intra and inter -personal conflict and how lack of human exchange can result in misunderstanding or loss. The film makes strong statements about the role of communication in preventing suicide, in soothing the human soul from grief and simply in building healthy relations. In the Tokyo scenes, we are immersed into the world of Chieko, a young girl who has lost her mother and who is constantly hurt in her quest to have a boyfriend and be loved. Chieko's character is wonderfully innovative mixing fragile sensitivity with a provocative, moody streak. Whether this mute-deaf girl signs or scribbles messages on her notebook, her energy is contagious. She does more than communicate, she makes you empathise so that you sense everything inside her. I had never seen Rinko Kikuchi before and I was completely spellbound by her touching performance. She is my favourite actress in this film and I hope to see more of her acting in the future.Interestingly, ""Babel"" is left unresolved. That is, as the newsreader puts it, ""Another happy ending for Americans!"" On a diegetic level, it speaks of Richard and Susan coming home safely and finding their children alive. But in the language of film, it's a cheeky jab at Hollywood's culture and its traditional endings which remain so at odds with life's realities. And so the clever writers have delivered a script which resolves all the tensions necessary to deliver a happy ending for the US characters, but not so for the other characters in the film.",Babel

So I stayed.... This ""movie"" made me so angry. I cannot believe that Brad Pitt has accepted the script. I normally assumed that he chose so far his roles. I do not understand the awards and all the medias interest for that long (very long) and boring film. It should be illegal to spend so much money for nothing.... Claude Lelouch is an expert in this kind of mixed stories within the same movie the difference is that at the end you feel like having a week sunny cruise in 2 hours.

Time after time it just plays on the emotions, filled with characters that just poke hot iron through my being without seeming to have a point besides doing it 'cause you can. I found it lacking purpose and the ability for me to enjoy it.For being so thorough I give it 3/10.

549,Hazzah,Babel: A Long Strange Trip,6,3 March 2007,"Babel: A Long Strange Trip. Film number 3 out of 5 of this years Best Picture nominees is ""Babel."" There's an odd theme occurring in films of late. The plot (or plots is more like it) of many movies have been revolving around coincidence. Babel is one such film.The overall plot revolves around a single rifle. Said rifle is first owned by a Japanese hunter with a deaf-mute daughter. The hunter uses the rifle on a trip, then gives it to a Morrocian who was his guide. Since then, he has lost his wife, and he has emotionally lost his daughter.The Morrocian (sp??) has sold the rifle to a local farmer in exchange for half the asking price and a free goat. The farmer lets his two boys keep the rifle while they shepherd the rest of his goats, so they can protect the herd from jackals.The boys argue about the usefulness of the rifle and how worthwhile a shot it is. The younger of the two is the better shot. He proves it by making a tourist bus his target for practice.Little does he know, the bus is carrying Brad Pitt and his wife, played by Cate Blanchett. They're in Morrocco to ""get away"" as Pitt puts it. The two have some marital and person issues they're both dealing with. These issues are never brought to the forefront. So, the audience can only assume it's a subject whose discussion could very well make their marriage crumble.Pitt and Blanchett have two kids left at home. They are being looked after by a Mexican caretaker named Amelia. Amelia receives an urgent call stating she must come to Mexico to see her son married. On the way back, she's stopped by the border patrol. She's placed under arrest simply because she's an alien who has been working in America for 16 years.Basically, the other theme of Babel is wrong choices, and the consequences because of them. Should Amelia had left for Mexico? She put the kids in danger, and then got caught herself. Should Pitt and Blanchett have gone to Morrocco? As they learned, the hard way, Morrocco doesn't exactly have the best medical system. Everything is miles away from everything else. If they wanted to be alone, they could have gone to an island in the Bahamas. Should the Japanese hunter have made a better effort to make closure with his daughter? to communicate with her even if she can't speak? Should the farmer had trusted his two young sons to use the gun properly? Overall, my feeling on the movie is one of overwhelming exhaustion. Watching the 2.5 hours slip past my eyes is tiring. It's not just because I feel as if I'm a world traveller now going from Morrocco to Japan to Mexico. But also because of all the subtitles I had to read.Each of the stories involved in Babel are fascinating, if not emotionally draining. Life is either slipping away, or has already slipped away from each character in the film. Each of the stories would have made an excellent film on their own.The tragedy of the life and choices the Japanese girl makes and her final acceptance of finding a way to accept her father for who he is, and vice versa.The story of the Amelia and how she came to America for a better life, traveling to her home country to witness the marriage of her son. Watching him make a life for himself, while she works hard so far away from him.Whatever the trouble in Brad and Cate's character's marriage is would be a great story to explore, especially given what tragedy befalls them on a getaway trip.Also, it would be a good story filled with agony and grief about the poor farmer and his sons.My feeling is this: Crash, best picture winner of 2005 did the coincidence story better.",Babel

The cinematography is excellent, the story is smart and original, the acting superior, and the drama touches on the human nature like no other movie produced in 2006. Yes, the movie is very hard to see. It is a drama that challenges the viewers, that is what makes this movie so appealing.

As I was watching the film, I was aware of some audience members who were actually laughing derisively at the film, which was a mystery to me because I was so completely drawn in. I realized early in the film to let go of analyzing and attempting to draw meaning, and to let it unfold like a dream.

It is just a bunch of tragedies shown in the same movie. And, the movie is very sad, depressing. I was ""depressed"" when it ended. The only thing I liked about this movie was that the actress, Cate Blanchett, is a cutie! Hey, I am a guy after all! But thumbs down, not recommended.

553,cram_zorg,Too long & complex,5,2 December 2006,"Just went to the movies with a friend to see ""Babel"". I was expecting something rather good because Brad Pitt plays in it and I usually like him as an actor.Basically, the movie is about 3 stories happening in 3 different countries and that are somehow connected, but in the end, it doesn't really matter if they are or not. To sum the movie up, it's like some shampoos or tooth paste, it's a 3 in 1. I think the story was a good idea, but yet, I can't help but feel disappointed. It was way too long, sometimes I just had a voice in my head shouting ""COME ON! MOVE IT!"". There also seemed to be more music than dialogues and the everything that happens is extremely predictable, there are no surprises, just like for the Mexican nurse who takes the two American kids over Mexican/US border to go to her son's wedding because she couldn't find any one else to take them and gets caught while going back to the US (this is not exactly the way it happens, but I woudn't want to spoil the whole thing for those who didn't see the movie).I may just add that the performance of all the actors were really excellent, specially the 2 marocan kids. It's actually their storry that touched me the most, because you see that they didn't mean to do anything wrong. It makes you smile when you hear the American government (in the movie) immedialty say that some terrorists tried to kill an American citizen.So, if you are depressed, avoid this movie. But if you love Brad Pitt, have a thing for complicated, dramatic and long stories, then you may like it. There's nothing to criticise about the actor's performances, just the storry that is really exhausting!Definitely not Brad Pitt's best movie...",Babel

They are just a few stories showing that people are alone in life, its hard to reach out to another human being and the fact that the film has only some recurrent themes: e.g. guns only makes the feeling of loneliness more intense. This film is realistic to the extent a good film can allow itself to be. It's realism is not concerned with the probability of the stories (altough how can you persuade someone that these histories did not take place)? But rather with 100% realism of peoples lives, reactions, problems, and even clothes and the settings. Its real power lies in the fact (as Irranitu has it) that it asks important questions- from those most essential like: is there God or everything is just a series of unfortunate or happy coincidences? To those more down to earth- would I do so much to be at my son's wedding? How would I react in such a stressful situation? I love this film also for the discreet satire on the American way of life and their 'immigration policy': isn't the character played by Brad Pitt in a situation of similar to this of a Mexican immigrant in the great USA - helpless, forsaken and yet those people from the 'third world' help him as much as they can.

Come to think of it, didn't pretty much the same thing happen in Crash? And so on and so forth. So it wasn't' a confusion of tongues so much as some people acting really stupidly. Granted, that can happen, but twice to the same family in as many days? unlikely. Would the Morroccan cops really have started shooting for no reason? Would Amelia's nephew really lost his mind at immigration, an insulting and humiliating process he'd probably been through thousands of times? Unlikely, but hey, what do I know?

557,jonjosejamora,What can go wrong will go wrong....,7,9 February 2007,"Babel is a movie of worst case scenarios. It's basically ""what can go wrong will go wrong"". What is astonishing though is that most of the occurrences seem very realistic. In the world today where so much is left to typical assumptions, events may seem as if they where something else. This is best portrayed by the Moroccan kids shooting at the tour bus, as if they were terrorists, a tragedy is portrayed through a misunderstanding. Common stereotypes are indeed dangerous and it is a simplification of matters based on nothing but bias. This same situation can be seen in our country (the Philippines); remember the political killings that had students and journalists viewed as rebels against the government. This film truly belongs to this age and its views on the people of this time; this is how i can say that it is believable.The problem of communication is ever present as manifested by the various plots in the movie. Being in a foreign land grants a certain paranoia as you are indeed alien in the most technical sense, as well as in the cultural sense. Problems of crossing the border can of course be exaggerated as an individual's ""race"" is an immediate aspect in being branded as a suspect. An American couple in desperate need of medical services with the burden of trying to relate to Moroccan locals presents a ""tourist nightmare"". How far can an embassy go for you? That certainly is the question. An embassy can only do so much, as it is only a visitor (although permanent). And when the burden is passed on to it, to protect its locals, time will not stop and will surely go on. The word ""Babel"" in its literal meaning and sense, which means to confuse, is a problem that shows us that there are consequences in the world that are caused simply by miscommunication.Preconceived notions are advantageous to some while disadvantageous to others. This film allows for three observations concerning a country's diplomacy and public image. These biases can of course make diplomacy hard to attain. A country ""can"" also promote the welfare of its locals, while even safeguarding security to the extremes, which at most times negatively, affects its foreigners. As a direct contrast, a country may endanger its own locals in protecting its public image that may promote diplomacy. Of course in a world of biases, especially against terrorists, there is a ""need"" for somebody to blame for a certain crime. This is all for the sake of the guise of false security.On the brighter side, the directing was exemplary. This film features a non-linear narration similar to ""The Pulp Fiction"" and ""Go"". It's enjoyable as it allows you to ""think"" and piece together how the stories interconnect. Chronological arrangement may seem odd, but in the end it serves to make you watch it once more as if replay value were present. The trend of including issues of interracial nature has once again been put forward similar to the opening of ""CRASH"". These stories of course market to the world of today as a lot of these events are based on what the trends and events are. Of the plots, the ""deaf-mute story"" shows how great the director is. This reminds me of a classic exercise that film students do, that of making a short film with out the use of ""dialogue"". The objective of that exercise is to show how good a director can lead you into thinking what the characters are ""thinking"" or ""putting you in their shoes"". Now the directing was superb as the most dramatic portions of Chieko's part is not ""dialogued"", as in her writing to the police officer, but you know exactly what she is thinking.To best explain what I think about the movie I will use the contribution of the sociologist Jean Baudrillard. This film was simply a ""Hyper-reality"" in that the events are an exaggeration of real. They are possible but in a way speculated although they are based on current events. In other words it is a fictional mirror of today's world. It may not exactly be true, but it presupposes some kind of explanation based on what has been observed.",Babel
558,eraser1-1,a desperate long film,1,11 February 2007,"It was an exhausting. I felt so desperate during the whole film, not entertaining in fact depressing. The story was disconnected, long at times boring than confusing too many story lines. Brad Pitt does not do frantic well nor did his co star. I mean you are hit with a bullet stuck in a country a foreign one at that his act was not believable, His wife was so wishy washy and winey,there was no chemistry between them at all. The only stars in the movie were the Mexican care giver and her nephew. Tons of chemistry between them and that part of the movie was believable for the 10 minute of scenes. The Japanese actors and actresses not sure why we needed to see this mute teenage girl nude that was a tad off balance,along with a missing father and mother, that part of the story was strange. The director should of just dealt with the father and where he was all during the movie you only saw him twice. The ending was so lame, very disappointing.Not impressed spend your money on Urban Landscapes it has a better message than this.",Babel

The whole Asian angle was simply dumb. Although the girl who played the deaf-mute did such a good job with the role.And the kids of Brad Pitt?

561,nicole666,Cinematic Masterpiece,8,5 November 2006,"This is an amazingly dramatic, moving story told in a non-linear form by the great director Alejandro G. Inarritu. It encourages one to think deeper about the world's current social, political situation and its impact on the whole world. Looking at Inarritus previously directed films ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" is another gritty, harsh look at today's society and I found its rawness pretty mind- blowing. I sincerely think that he's one of the most talented directors out there. The emotional ups and downs throughout the story makes you enjoying (or, depending on your personal emotional state) every single minute of this over 2hr. long feature. At the end, not everything seems as hopeless as one would think - just like every day life! The framing and composition of the picture is another noteworthy remark, which also includes the very beautiful music. One of the best films this year so far and a very intelligent, provocative ""Mini-Hollywood"" film with an excellent cast. A must see!",Babel

That's what makes me sick; Hollywood keeps re-running a winning strategy and this is one of many examples that this is true.But still, this film is not Bad. My low grade on this is based on the deja vú feeling it gave me when watching.

563,matthewgtravis-1,This movie is not as good as some say...,4,18 November 2006,"This movie tells four stories that take place in different parts of the world, they are all connected in some way. It is an interesting and well executed film, however for my tastes it was a bit too long and it was sort of a bummer, nothing you would call a ""feel good"" film. The movie cuts back and forth to the different stories at what seems to be dramatic points in each one. Just when some action has taken place or something seems like it is going to be revealed in one story it switches to a different story which became annoying to me. The beginning of the movie shows two Moroccan boys being given a rifle by their father and told too shoot jackals, this is the first story, the second story introduces Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's characters as they are riding in a tour bus through Morocco. The third story arc explores the young son and daughter of Pitt and Blanchett's charters as they are left home with their Hispanic housekeeper, the fourth and last story arc involves a teenage Japanese girl who is deaf. If this seems like a lot going on, it is. It doesn't help either that the movie has many depressing moments. Just as personal taste I like to watch films that are not too heavy but that being set aside what the film maker did with the end of the movie really irritated me. Somehow, at the end of the movie after all these things that the viewer could maybe take some sort of message from were made completely meaningless to me because of the Hollywood style ""everything's not all bad"" ending it resorts too. I don't want to proved too much information for anyone who hasn't seen the film but without saying exactly the details, basically this movie shows people surviving and succeeding when the cards were all against them which felt like they had done that just so it would be more acceptable to mass audiences which ruined it for me. Three of the stories have one specific thing in common, the rifle. The story about the two children at home with their Hispanic woman is the exception. I don't think I am giving away too much by saying that the two boys who have gone off with their new rifle shoot at the moving tour bus Pitt and Blanchett are in not realizing the consequences and result in shooting Blanchett's character. The story of the Japanese girl seems unrelated until you see the connection that the rifle was her fathers at one point, so basically the story about her shows her difficulty with her sexuality and being deaf. The story about the two children turns into a chase across the boarder from the immigration police after the housekeeper had taken them to Mexico for a wedding. Three of the stories have happy endings after all the terrible things that happen, the only story that does not end happy is the story about the two Moroccan boys. It would seem that this is the expendable story, American audiences would not feel as sympathetic for these characters, they clearly look like what we believe terrorists to look like in this country so if you have to have one person die it might as well be one of them right? It seems as if the film makers thought well the two white kids in the dessertthey live, the wife and mother who is shot and left without help in Morocco lives and on top of that Brad Pitts character offers the man who housed his bleeding wife while they waited for a helicopter did not accept his money as they left despite the fact that Pitt yelled and cursed at everyone in the village with this attitude that his wife's life is more precious than anyone of these people in the village and he is in their country personally I would not expect the same safety in a foreign country that I am promised in the U.S.A.(this was just my feeling), and finally the young girl who was so confused connects with her father so apparently that is all fine too. At the end I still am not sure what the message was that the movie was trying to convey. Was it about how many problems can surround a rifle shot or was it about paying more attention to your children? I'm not sure. All in all the movie left me feeling unsatisfied and worn out after its long run time and disappointed by its out of place optimistic endings.",Babel

565,tassiedevil,It was well worth to suffer with a bit the pessimism.,8,6 March 2007,"There is no doubt that the movie mostly continues in a pessimistic aura. You feel sometimes tired to keep your mood up, but we should not forget that this is the idea of Inarritu and Arria; to make trilogy out of human tragedies. Yes this movie is not for the people who is after some ordinary drama, you have to be ready for heavy load of troubles, so that you can enjoy the movie as a whole.For me the screenplay was so carefully finished and the movie was so professionally directed, that I really did not care how sad I felt while watching it. Inarritu is a really talented person that he made such a neat work although he hasn't got too many directing experiences other than this trilogy. Not only did I observed the lack of communication between (by all means) different people, but I also felt the communications or the connections of feelings between people. Even though everybody must have known by now why the name is Babel, but I also want to mention it shortly. It is one of the stories in genesis, how God got angry with the arrogance of the people in Babel, and changed every peoples languages so that nobody could communicate with each other and faced with a big chaos.This movie is a good example for the fact that actors give better performances in a good movie and with a skillful director. It must be a special role for Brad Pitt, looking so natural and showing weaker parts of his heart. The peasants, who were obviously not professional actors were also performing their parts really well. And the scenes in a totally different country ind landscape were so real.As a summary, I feel that I watched a genuinely good movie, it was well to suffer with a bit the pessimism.",Babel
566,avgmoviefan,the key to babel is THEME *spoilers,9,28 January 2007,"i enjoyed the movie for its THEMATIC CONTENT: thematically, the film deals with the need for understanding, forgiveness, and love when dealing with death.both the brad/kate and chieko/father story lines focus on characters dealing with the past death of a family member: brad's son sam and chieko's mother.the yusseff/ahmed and amelia/kids story lines concern the actual/symbolic deaths of characters we see: ahmed and, symbolically, the kids (from amelia's point of view).with brad/kate, there's the need for both to be understood and forgiven by the other for the death of sam. this happens during the ""pan"" scene, as they talk, forgive, and reconnect with a poignant kiss, perhaps developing a deeper love as two who have gone through the trauma of losing a child together. it's kate's need of brad in the pan scene that underscores their need for each other if they are to move beyond loss to recovery.with chieko/father, there's the need to connect with each other in a way that the mother didn't, and who, as a result, committed suicide. initially, we see chieko attempting to connect physically with men: the dentist, her friend's cousin, the detective. but these attempts fail. will sex save her? no. she needs something more intimate than having sex with relative strange men. at the end, we see her hold hands with her father. it is a moment of connection, perhaps, understanding. two people dealing with the death of mother/wife together. in both scenes, the characters move away from blame towards forgiveness and love, together.added note, both scenes are linked through character vulnerability: kate needing the help of her husband with the pan, and chieko standing naked on the balcony, perhaps contemplating suicide. in the end, each couple survives literally and figuratively: kate doesn't die of blood loss, and chieko doesn't jump, and each ""survives"" the death of a family member by connecting with another survivor.unlike these two story lines, the next two, although they deal with death, aren't at the stage where characters can expect total forgiveness- yet. the deaths have just happened.in the yuseff/ahmed storyline, we see ahmed killed before our eyes. seeing his dead brother and the grief of his father, yuseff breaks the rifle and, arms raised, surrenders, saying something like, ""help my brother. they aren't to blame. i killed the American. help my brother."" it's at this moment when the moroccan investigator, instead of resorting to violence as he has with other characters, pauses, looking at yuseff, dumbfounded. he understands in this moment that they aren't looking for terrorists, but this boy. this isn't about terrorism, but tragedy- a child's poor decision has lead to dire consequences.similarly, in the amelia/kids storyline, amelia, like yuseff, makes a mistake with dire consequences, and, in the end, she loses the children she loves. while they don't actually die, her deportation and subsequent separation from them acts as a symbolic death. she will no longer see them, feed them, play with them, care for them- they may as well be dead. like the yuseff storyline, this is a tragedy. taking the children to the wedding turns out to be a life-altering mistake.in these two story lines, yuseff and amelia are beginning the journey of dealing with the deaths of those they loved, as well as, their own responsibility in these deaths. the first two story lines (brad/kate, chieko/father) offer the possibility for redemption.it's this thematic connection between the story lines that unifies the film overall and, imho, makes it a beautiful work of art.it's worth a second viewing.",Babel
567,octoberth1975,Strangely lacking,3,19 February 2007,"Though I didn't think much of Amores Perros, I liked 21 grams very much. So when I saw that Alejandro González Iñárritu had a new film out, starring some actors I respect, I was looking forward to something powerful, well-acted and intelligent. What a disappointment! I walked away from the cinema feeling empty about the whole experience.I really didn't see the point this film was trying to make. It's as though three unconnected short stories have been adapted into a screenplay, with very tenuous and predictable links joining them into one overly-long film. None of the issues raised is explored in enough detail, and none of the characters is developed well enough to provoke even the mildest interest, never mind sympathy.The acting, while okay, is not phenomenal. I don't think Brad Pitt created a character in Richard that will stand out in my mind. And poor Cate blanchett had little to do but lie around looking spaced out or pee in a pot! The Moroccans came across as brutal, backward people; the Japanese segment was typically imbued with techno-obsessed schoolgirl fetishism; and the Mexicans were depicted as jolly-but-poor yahoos who like to party. Writing doesn't get much lazier.I'd assumed, because of the title, that this would be a film about the basic inability of people to communicate, or the struggle of completely different cultures trying to understand each other. Brad Pitt's story was a wasted opportunity in this regard. How much more interesting and frightening it would have been if he and Cate Blanchett had been backpacking on their own and had to get help without knowing the language or customs. But the fact that they have a translator who speaks perfect English and is very eager to help means they have a pretty easy time in the end.Another waste of a potentially dramatic scenario is when Ameila and the kids get stranded in the desert. What a great dilemma! And yet, ten minutes later, she's picked up and the kids are found safe and well - though this happens off-screen and is brushed over quickly. What was the point of stranding them out there in the first place? They could have been stopped at the border and had the same deportation scene without a pointless car chase - we never did find out what happened to Santiago.Other unanswered questions: Why was it necessary to have the subplot of the Moroccan boy masturbating over his sister? Why did Chieko lie about her mother's suicide by simply describing a different kind of suicide? And what did she write in her note to the cop? I get the feeling this is supposed to be something deep and mysterious that the audience should ponder for themselves. Instead, it's just annoying.There's nothing more irritating than a film that is so sure of its own importance and dramatic credentials, but is actually just a complete mess of po-faced ideas that could have been interesting if handled differently. I don't understand why Babel is being nominated for awards. I'll be staying away from Iñárritu's films in future.",Babel
568,davidlmitchellbsc,A Masterpiece!,10,4 March 2007,"Where does one begin when describing a masterpiece? How could one come up with a link between a repressed deaf-mute Japanese schoolgirl, a father with two goat-herder sons and an exhibitionist daughter; a Mexican nannie going to her son's wedding and Brad Pitt with Kate Blanchett as a married couple trying to put their lives back together? Brad's acting isn't. It's real life. The actor is the man. Kate Blanchett matches his excellence with her all-too-human injured wife. No glamour Hollywood movie this.In a film knee-deep in the very best of natural acting, the father of the two boys stands out. He gave his sons a rifle to defend their flock of goats against jackals and they precipitate an international incident. The woman shot is American so her importance - her tragedy - transcends all others. Terrorists indeed! There are too many peaks in this masterpiece to just pick out one or two but I guess that a couple of scenes really moved me. Scenes like the kindness of the bus driver; the harshness of the American border patrol; the pain of the father when his young son is shot dead; Kate Blanchett's all-too-human wife peeing her pants; the naked schoolgirl wishing she were like her non-deaf/non-mute peers; the tears of the soon-to-be-deported Mexican nanny....An amazing film with many levels.Enjoy!",Babel

The underlying premise of the movie that communication can be distorted is demonstrated most directly through the five languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, Japanese and sign).But the real communication message for me is how the personal filters of each of the characters changes how they communicate and how they receive communication. The two responses from Santiago at the border to the US officials demonstrates this most clearly - his different states of mind on each occasion results in a dramatically different response leading to enormous consequences. But there are so many examples in the film.It was beautifully shot (especially some scenes of Tokyo), wonderfully acted and directed.

Having things suck and continue sucking isn't artsy, it's cowardly, as bad as any kid film that just says nature is great and animals sing.

580,kenlee_kp,"Babel makes you lost in the state of confusion, deliberately making the viewers to find the way out.",9,2 May 2009,"First, I like to say that this film blew my mind away till the end as oppose to what my own selfish, stereotypic judging of the DVD cover would've made me to infer how mundane and slow a film will be.Since, this film is already about 3 years due past, I am really grateful to finally watch this than keep shoving its title aside and instead watching more of renown, general mainstream movies. I just couldn't forgive myself for not having watched this great piece of art work, yet until now after finished watching it tonight. I was so riveted and engrossed during the whole length of the film to a point where I didn't want it to end. The reason why of that could be induced from watching the sexually charismatic(as oppose to its plot), partially enigmatic(probably due to the obfuscation caused by the deaf), and vicariously empathic Japanese character, Rinko Kikuchi, of whom I found myself acquainted for the first time through this movie.As a film lover and perfervid filmmaker, my exact favorite film genre or style falls into this type of movie this director, Inarritu, makes. I love the works of films that make our brains tingle and run for its power juices for flowing profusely with as much stimulation as it can deliver by letting us enabled to follow its film's interpretations cognitively.For example, instead of seeing a film in a typical, linear flow of time, as much disparate and disheveled as this film might be, the power of nonlinear film making or editing has shown us how a film can deliver its message efficiently to the audiences with much shocking impact and surprising realizations toward the end where all the previous questions eventually come to be answered, just like Babel has shown us; no matter how rackety and confusing its sounds are, they are still consequently heard and understood, or try to be, at least.The acting are, all around, superb and flawless, even including all the unknown and small actors who have made this movie rather ironically iridescent as possible, casting away the dark and gloomy nuance of the film. They are all good, nonetheless, and that's how its genuinely unique plot has seen its true light supported by the great casts and crews. To a little dismay though, the lead roles of Pitt and Blanchett aren't that much of focus in this film. However, that is the main purpose of this movie, after all.The last thing I want to talk about this film is that the scene in which we see the Japanese girl character, Kikuchi, having the fun of night, dazzled by the club flashing lights, provokes us to simultaneously and vicariously feel what it is like to be in her shoes; being deaf all around her milieus in the living. How brilliant the director is has been revealed through this piece of scene where all of a sudden, through Kikuchi's perspective, while in her view, there is no longer a sound heard, and that was astoundingly clear and caustic to a point of realization as to how ignorant or unthinkable we were or it is to imagine about a deaf person's perspective(from a normal person). And, the cuts keep going back and forth for us to compare between the no sound and sound of its environment.It was the second favorite scene to the most favorite part of the movie, which is the point where we get to see Brad Pitt's talking over the phone to his son, the scene we overheard from Amelia's point of view in the beginning of the film. This stamps the main tweak of plot into my forehead and I loved it as a frisson electrified all my hairs up.Anyways, this became one of the top all time favorites now, and it should be on your list, too.Highly recommended, and I recommend other works of this director, also.9/10.",Babel
581,polarisursus,I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this DVD!,1,24 February 2007,"I knew from the synopsis that the lives of different people in three different countries were remotely connected with each other, and ""something"" that would merit this movie for an Oscar nomination would happen. However, when that connection became evident, the entire theme, the whole plot was a joke. For those of us that were watching this disappointment, we all came to the conclusion that is was boring and insignificant. It was like sitting and waiting for the impact and something to come together. There were no interesting points, characters, or a plot. I can not wait to sell my copy of this disaster. Totally BORING.",Babel
582,toothygrin,Unpleasant viewing experience,2,13 December 2006,"Everyone seems impressed with the intertwining of multiple characters' tales. However Babel and Crash are latecomers to this technique. The master seems to me to have been Robert Altman. In Nashville (1977 or so) and Shortcuts (1995ish) stories are dextrously woven and it is so satisfying to be surprised by the connections, even when the outcomes are unfortunate. Babel seems to have been written as a proof to the theorem of Murphy's Law: the worst possibilities become reality.It seems that from the perspective of film craft this is a great technical work. However why make a film showing how imprudence puts others in harm's way? I didn't enjoy watching this film.",Babel
583,malar-1,Utterly Uncompelling,4,3 March 2007,"I wouldn't bother commenting on this film, except that it annoys me to no end that it should have been in the running for a Best Film Oscar. I know the Oscars are themselves a joke in many ways, but nominating this as one of the best is really too much. And it's not because it is a ""foreign"" film. As part of my job I run a foreign film series and I love many of them. As is often the case, the film was nominated because it is politically correct. I'm as liberal as they come, but a bad movie, liberal values or not, is a bad movie. The director was obviously going for a big statement, but he neglected to create any sympathetic characters (even the Mexican nanny started to get on my nerves after a while) or compelling scenes along the way. It was way too long and could have used a good editor. One example--the scene of the helicopter flying the wounded American woman to a hospital. How many shots do we need to establish that it blows a lot of dust around as it lands in and then takes off from the village? And, how many shots do we need of it flying to the hospital? As I said to my wife while we were watching it, ""Oh, the helicopter is flying to the hospital. Here's another shot of the helicopter flying to the hospital. Oh, the helicopter is still flying to the hospital."" Another scene that went on way too long was the one in the Japanese disco. And the connection of the Japanese girl's story with the American couple's story was incredibly forced. Also, the business of presenting some of the scenes out of sequence served no purpose other than artistic pretension. I agree that the film's structure has much in common with ""Crash,"" but ""Babel"" creates none of the dramatic tension or sympathy for the characters that ""Crash"" does. I'd skip it if I were you. Try ""Children of Men"" instead, which I think was overlooked.",Babel
584,grc-1,Almost perfect,9,3 December 2006,"Just a quick note to point out two criticisms.First, I thought the film was brilliant - almost (but not quite) as brilliant as 21 Grams. But......it was 30 minutes too long. I think it could be edited down by about 30 minutes without a significant loss of content.Second, I'm glad to see that IMDb has picked up on the goof regarding the angle of the bus. For about twenty minutes I was expecting a plot twist related to the fact that the Cate Blanchette character couldn't have been shot by the Moraccan kids at the angle shown - I even leaned over and said so to my wife when it happened - I figured it was shown that way deliberately and looked for some alternate explanation. Like I said, maybe twenty minutes before I realized that it was just a goof and not a plot point. Frankly, I expect better.But that's it - other than those two complaints I really enjoyed the film and recommend it highly to anyone interested in serious movie-making.",Babel
585,arvig,Looks like I'm in the minority with regards to this film,4,10 February 2007,"I suspect I might be in the general minority with regards to this film. Mind you, the acting was superb, in fact somewhat ironically it makes me wish to track the careers of actors I had not heard of before seeing this film. That, along with it's direction is why I'm not giving this film a single star. I blame neither the actors nor the director. I blame the script.But, to me this film is in a category of ""Crap happens"", I will say it that way to avoid vulgarity. Otherwise, a film that mistakes pathos and unrelenting tragic events for a deep, moving story. I would honestly suggest that anyone who is diagnosed as clinically depressed not see this film, it might drive them to suicide, and I am not trying to be sarcastic with this statement.The whole idea, is that one rifle causes all these tragic events. To be specific, the shot fired by one of the Moroccan boys. Yet, why would they shoot a bus? Yes, they are children, but we're still to honestly believe that children that know that said bullets can kill a jackal, and that would know that a moving vehicle, especially a bus would contain people, would fire upon it, simply because the man who sold it to them said the round would travel up to 3 kilometers? That is one such absurdity that we as the audience is to believe. From there, the unrelenting gloom and tragic events unfold in a quagmire of depression. Yes, I do expect a film like this to be tragic, I don't expect some shiny, happy film from this. But I don't expect this level of unrelenting sadness, nor do I want it.There are other things left unanswered too. For instance, why the younger of the two Moroccan boys was spying on his own sister while she bathed, what was written on the note the deaf-mute girl gave to the police officer, why, even in her seeking love, said girl would actually disrobe and attempt to clumisly seduce the police officer, what happened to the two children who attended the Mexican wedding, and so forth. I do wonder if this was an attempt to force us to stay interested in the film, to force us to wonder what happened, almost as if the writer of the script didn't have faith that his own movie wasn't memorable enough. He had to leave things unanswered, strings untied, so we're forced to decide to dismiss them, or ponder what may have happened. Perhaps if this film wasn't such a mire of depression, I might actually choose to do exactly that. But in my mind, I wish to wipe the memory of such from me. I don't see self inflicted emotional angst via what should be a form of entertainment and art as enjoyable.Obviously this film isn't for me, please take this as my opinion, not an attack upon anyone who does find this film enjoyable. Again, I shall credit all actors within this film, and even the direction. It's not their fault that the script made them in many cases unbelievable as people, it's not their fault they were stuck trying to make the coincidences around a single rifle believable.Anyway, my two cents on this film. Perhaps I don't comprehend it. If so, then I do ask that people not flame me for an opinion, I of course fully welcome it if people disagree..as long as they choose to do so in a non-condensending, respectful manner. Any flames, any arrogance or narcissism or snobbish replies to my first review here on the IMDb will simple be laughed at by me.",Babel

I guess then that the only readers will have something to do with producing the film, interested in feedback. So here's a little feedback to the film makers: pee sounds louder than that. As I watched the film I found myself mesmerized by a very believable story, amazed by the craftsmanship of the director and his crew. Capturing the astonishment of the little freckle faced boy in the chicken scene was near perfect directing and editing. I noticed the dirt and sweat on the neck lines and wondered at skill of the crew in capturing such vivid and believable scenes. The scenery was amazing. The minor detractor was having big Hollywood stars with such uninspired roles; you didn't need them. You would have done better with unknowns. The other players, unknowns, were better. Everything about the movie was sharp until one of the most human scenes when the female star had to urinate. At the end of the movie, when I saw the long the list of the crew and players I thought, OK, that's why it was so good: it took a lot of people. Many very talented people. Even the big stars were good, if not great. Everything sharp except the sound crew. Um, what? Was that American embarrassment at bodily functions? You could have made the scene by making a stream of urine sound like a stream of urine, not a light trickle of water. You, Mr.-Sound-Person-who-ruined-the-scene, brought me back to my own reality instead of keeping me captivated by the movie reality. Try harder next time, OK. You don't want to ruin any more masterpieces.",Babel

True Amores Perros is fantastic, and 21 grams has its moments, but you truly see Inarritu's genius show through in Babel with excellent directing, an engrossing atmosphere and moving performances. This was a film that had to be made, and we should be all be grateful that it was. Unfortunately the film is disgraced by the hollow pieces of junk that won best picture the past two years. Being compared to Crash is an insult, and losing to the Departed of all things is just plain ignorant on the part of the academy. This is a highly intelligent and culturally relevant film which deserves a lot more praise than its getting.

590,djmullen,What a worthless movie!,1,16 November 2006,"My girlfriend wanted to see this movie. We both felt that we'd wasted our time. Three sappy, pointless stories are joined together into an extended futility.A few questions: 1: Why, when the kid is shooting at the front of the bus, does the bullet come straight in a side window? Judging by the hole in the glass and the neck it hits, it came from about 90 degrees to the left of the bus, not straight ahead.2: What kind of dipsh*t kid shoots at cars and buses? He didn't look insane and he seemed to be familiar enough with buses and cars to know that they have people in them. For that matter, what kind of father gets a new rifle, fires a shot that misses then watches his two sons fire and miss and then sends them out with the rifle to herd the goats while he goes somewhere else, telling them to get at least three jackels while he's away? 3: And what kind of box of ammo fits in one hand and has 300 rounds in it? 4: Why the hell couldn't Brad Pit's wife ride in the bus? The road looked pretty smooth to me, there was no obvious jostling in the scenes inside the bus and it is possible for her to lay on the floor, after all. They could have made her a little bed and been out of there.The Mexican story isn't worth commenting on.I thank whoever gave us the Japanese nudity. At least I got something out of the movie.

591,arlauer,What a great film!,10,22 November 2006,"Wow! What an excellent film! This is the best film to date by Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu (director of Amores perros [2000] and 21 Grams [2003]). Not only are three fascinating stories intertwined (the story of two Berber kids in Morocco, a Mexican nanny in San Diego/Tijuana, and an adolescent deaf mute girl in Tokyo), but the symmetry of the stories is surprisingly telling. Some of the symmetries are: the encounter of the police with the three principals in each sequence; the significance of a fire weapon; evacuation (physical and otherwise) scenes; the problem with languages (Berber, Arabic, and English; Spanish and English; Japanese and Japanese sign language); generational conflicts (busy parents and working children; absent parents and abandoned children; and a workaholic father and deaf mute daughter), etc. And yet, in spite of all the connections and conflicts, there are resolutions to problems, some tragic, others sad, some happy. What I found most admirable about this work is how it deals with personal stories in a global way. It is also amazing how it deals with social and political issues without moralizing or pointing the finger at any group, person, or nation for the (bad) things that happen in the world. It is an honest, challenging, intricate, and moving film. I can't think of a better one in recent memory. Some may compare it with Crash. I would disagree. Crash is unbearably moralistic, unrealistic, and stereotypical. Babel is international, yet local, and points the way to the future of film-making as a global enterprise.",Babel
592,GregFromOakland,I don't really know why they made this movie,4,21 January 2007,"Babel uses the scheme used in Traffic and Crash, which is to have multiple stories with a thread in common which isn't initially obvious. Unlike those other two movies Babel is basically a soap opera with a shooting here and a few close calls for some of the characters to give it some drama. But basically nothing really that important happens. Most of the drama comes from either miscommunication or stupidity.The underlying message of this movie is ""Gosh, strange things happen sometimes."" Good, dramatic acting from a very good cast, the problems are with the story which is based on a really dumb accident, and overblown dramatic effects, especially from hand-held cameras.",Babel

This time the story was told in a sort of a mixture of Amores perros and 21 grams but that wasn't the more interesting this time, a lot of people complain that the way the story's relate to each other wasn't done in a very revelatory way, but that wasn't the only important, this time any of the four story's were very interesting for itself, the story from japan specially was my favorite.The acting was some kind of let down compared to 21 grams with Benicio del Toro, Gael Garcia did a very good job and the others where decent.Overall a very good drama, well put together, good cast, good plot, also the cinematography was excellent, this is a very recommendable movie , but hey this is a serious drama, be aware of what kind of movie it is before you go to the theater looking for a completely different kind of movie, like an action movie of Brad Pit or some like that.9/10",Babel
594,rboothe,More like Sweet Hereafter than Crash,10,23 November 2006,"In order to understand this film, the first thing to note is that even though the sequence of events that are depicted play out in a nonlinear sequence in ""film time"", the events described happen in a very specific sequence in ""world time"". Here is the sequence in which certain critical events happened in ""world time"": 1) A mother in Japan commits suicide with a gun leaving a deaf daughter and a husband behind, 2) The father gives away a gun as a gift to a Moroccan guide (probably the same gun used in the suicide), 3) The gun ends up in the hand of a Moroccan child who shoots an American woman traveling on a tour bus, 4) The nanny who is watching the American woman's children back in the USA is forced to continue watching them for a few extra days even though she does not want to do so because her son is getting married in Mexico, 5) The nanny takes the children, without permission, to the wedding in Mexico, and in the course of some dramatic events during the return home, loses the children in the desert, 6) The children in the desert do not die, but are rescued.This plot structure is NOT the same as in films such as Crash where several plot lines play out in parallel, with occasional intersections of characters and events. Babel uses a linear plot structure that implies causation. A metaphysical moral order is depicted in which one bad event causes another bad event, and then another, like ricocheting billiard balls, playing out over the surface of the globe.So what started this chain reaction? And what caused it to suddenly stop, allowing the American children to survive rather than being left to die in the desert? These events are not depicted directly in the movie and must be inferred. However, the director/screenwriter provide an overwhelming number of clues, all of which point to only one reasonable inference. The triggering evil event was incest by the Japanese father with his daughter, and only when this hideous secret was exposed (the mechanism being a letter written by the daughter to a police officer) was the chain reaction of evil stopped in its tracks.I could spend paragraphs explicating the evidence for this inference, but all I will do here is present a few examples. I invite anyone skeptical of my interpretation to go back and re-view the movie watching for the clues that are obvious from beginning to end once one starts looking for them. Consider the opening scene. What is revealed in this scene is that the Japanese girl is psychologically ready to explode over a situation in which an adult who is supposed to be responsible for enforcing the rules properly does not do so. Consider the aggressive, hostile response of the Japanese girl in exposing herself in the nightclub following dialog that includes a crude joke about ""having sex with your father"". Consider the inappropriate sexual come-ons to adult males including the dentist and the police officer (behaviors that would cause any psychologist evaluating this girl to immediately be suspicious about potential sexual abuse). Finally, take a quiz that has the following following multiple choice question: Your are watching a scene in a movie and a young girl standing naked on a balcony is approached by an older man. When he reaches her side, they hold hands. Your immediate interpretation of what is likely being depicted in this filmatic scene is: a) This is a father and his daughter, or b) These are two lovers.",Babel

597,ROCO148,A decent movie with lots of flaws.,7,23 February 2007,"Babel, despite its excessive length and plot flaws, is a reasonably powerful movie. The movie has a lot of great elements to it. The whole theme of misunderstanding was very well developed. This was done both on a superficial level (i.e., the misunderstanding of languages), but also on a much deeper level. The thoughts and intentions of most characters are misjudged and misunderstood. The loving nanny puts the safety of the kids before her own safety and is all but accused of trying to kill them. The Morroccan villagers do everything they can to help the dying wife, and are regarded as vagabond idiots. The beautiful young Japanese girl desperately reaches out to so many different people, and is simply seen as a monster. This is a powerful theme and is true in so many ways in our modern world. Of the three major subplots, the Japanese one was the best. In itself, it could have made for an interesting movie. It was subtle yet moving. You have this beautiful young lady who is deaf (not disabled- deaf people are different, not disabled) and trying to recover from the recent suicide of her mother (about which we know very little). She is struggling with many of the things that normal teenagers struggle with. She tries to reach out to so many people and no one seems to care, and so she resorts to desperate, animalistic measures. Now, I will list some flaws for this movie. The Japanese portion was the most well-done. However, as I have already hinted at, it should have been better developed. What is the nature of the relationship between the father and the daughter? Why is it that the mother killed herself? What made me most angry is that this story had almost nothing to do with the rest of the movie. For the first 90 minutes I was trying to figure out what the possible connexion would be, and when it finally came I thought to myself, ""are you kidding me?"". It seems that the writer really liked the Japanese storyline (and rightly so) and tried desperately to include it in this movie, failing to make it believable. However, this lack of believability fits very well with the rest of the movie. From almost start to finish we have to suspend our disbelief and just go with the flow if the movie is to have any meaning. Why would these Morroccan kids, who seem both lovable and loving, shoot recklessly at a moving bus? Are we supposed to believe that they have no regard for human life? Why would the European tourists care so little about the woman who was just shot? French people are not the world's nicest, but they have more regard for human life than that! Why did it even matter that the bus stay so long? The woman was clearly in no condition to travel on the bus, and they were waiting the whole time for an ambulance/helicopter? What bloody difference did it make that the bus be there? Why was there no replacement found for the nanny when she had to go to her son's wedding? It was obviously expected that the parents would still be in Morrocco (even if the woman hadn't gotten shot, its not like they were gonna fly back that day), and the nanny surely most have known about her son's wedding for many months. Why would the nanny's nephew just leave his aunt and the two young kids for dead in the middle of the dessert? One more thing: this movie makes white people look awful bad. Now, as a white man myself, I'm no big fan of white people, and the portrayal was relatively accurate. But, am I really supposed to have a lot of sympathy for Brap Pitt, when he's cursing off everyone? Am I really supposed to believe that a US customs agent would care more about arresting an honest, loving Mexican woman then finding 2 lost white children? The white children themselves are spoiled brats. The movie doesn't have a single sincere, decent white person. Even the dying woman manages to be a complete, racist a**hole. The movie makes a respectable statement about the rampant misunderstanding which exists in our post-modern world. It's also a good statement against the arrogance or white people. However, some things are taken to extreme, and the plot needs refining. Actually, the movie would have been better if just the Japanese part was kept.",Babel

No just language, but other more subtle ways, and has been done masterfully.Don't try to connect the arms, USA, blah, blah... because it is meaningless.

599,renogade,Now just hear me out on this,4,20 February 2017,"Of course 4 is a pretty low score for a movie, but I do have my scientific reasons for ranking it so low. I will discuss the characters in this movie without spoiling anything, so don't worry. Now hold on to your hats. It's story time.Normally when I really like a movie I don't tell about the experience of me seeing it. When hearing people telling me about the great things in a movie, I'm all on board. Great cast, music, director and plot you tell me? Yeah sure, let's watch it.So imagine my surprise when I saw this movie, with all these factors included, and really disliked it. Babel is one of the most unique movies I've ever seen, but still lacks in normal places. In the movie we are introduced to 4 stories all in different parts around the world with different cultures. Having heard of the story of The Tower of Babel about a million times in school during art class, I found myself interested in the fact that miscommunication and clashing cultures were gonna be in a high rated movie that I've never heard of.The movie starts out promising, with some familiar faces and some pretty imagery. But just when I'm interested, the movie shifts from place and perspective to another character.It's easy to come up with a rating for a movie. With 4 stories, they all need to be great to get a 10, but let's be honest, you know it isn't going down that way.The story of Brad and Blanchett is pretty interesting through the whole movie, because there is an essence of urgency and emotions in it. The story of Brad's Mexico Maid is already lacking in any of the factors that had me interested. Her story feels really random, dragged out, unnecessary and of course: boring. I didn't care for this stupid character or the random people around her.Then there is the story of the Boys who started all this mess. Their story is also interesting to watch, because it brings the whole 'conflict with cultures' element of the movie back, like with Pitt and Blacnhett's story. Sadly this story isn't really present that much, the characters are kinda annoying and is also dragged out. As in, 'when things get's interesting, we're greeted to a random part of the deaf girl'And now of course we got to talk about the deaf girl. Without a doubt the worst story in the movie because it's the most worthless.At least Mexico Maid (It's just a maid from Mexico, did't mean anything mean spirited) had a relation with Brad Pitt's kids in the movie, while the deaf girl does not. Her ''Story'' is, and I'm not joking, that she and her friends go out for a day. And she wants to have sex. Which is impossible, because everybody thinks she's a freak, because she's deaf? Yes, we have a couple and two random kids with good stories, a boring story of the maid and a story about getting laid in Japan. I thought it started kinda interesting, but the story of deaf girl has no substance in it. at all. Her connection to the main story is so laughable, it's atrocious.So to let's go the scoreboard. IF the movie did everything perfect, it'd be a 10 But that's 1/4 of the movie with one random, stupid story So it's already a 7,5. Then we have Mexico Maid's story that drags along like legless horse, with only two kids to care about. So + for the kids, minus the rest. The movie is already a 5,5 Still meh, right? Story about the kids is average. Really drags sometimes. so... 1,5? That's one point off of Gryffindor. So the movie is a 4,5? Nope The ending isn't fulfilling at all. It just ends. Kinda disappointing.With that being said. The movie has good visuals, good music and only two good stories in its 2:23 hour run time.Worth it? Nah I'd skip this if I were you. But if you got enjoyment out of this movie, that's great. I'm just a bitter guy with an opinion. So check the movie out if you're curious, but be prepared.",Babel
600,versus75,"Sadly, it was somewhat disappointing.",6,15 November 2006,"I was quite disappointed by this film. It felt too gratuitous, too forced. The tragic aspect was pushed too far and for no apparent reason but to show grief. It felt to me that the director/writer just took the easy way out and used the same formula as in their previous films and went overboard this time. The Japanese story had no relationship to the other 2 except for a very weak link; a link that was used almost as an excuse to show another (yawn) story of grief. I understand the director/writer planned a trilogy; but did they really have to make all 3 films back to back? With the same exact formula? Even the soundtrack by Santaolalla was virtually identical to the previous work. The acting wasn't great either; Gael Garcia's Tijuana drunk was completely unconvincing, Brad Pitt's phony baggy eye makeup wasn't either and the dull cinematography completely robbed the film of any atmosphere, instead of making it gritty as I assume the filmmakers wanted. What the film said to me basically is; the filmmakers are trying too hard to be tragic, and sad, and anti-happy-Hollywood-ending and also put more care in big exotic and expensive locations and big name actors than in a convincing film.I hope this director has a different card up his sleeve and proves he's not just a one trick pony.",Babel

Then once we started to understand what was going on, we really didn't want to continue with the film but we had already committed over an hour of our time already so we just decided to stick it out through the rest of the film. And we couldn't believe that it just ended. The film just stopped. There was really nothing to tie the stories together fully, only the guessing on our part. The film was extremely slow. I could have taken a nap and still would have gotten he whole story by just watching the last 15 minutes. I don't understand how the Japanese girl has anything to do with the story about her father's rifle. Not everyone wants to see a naked Japanese girl. I don't, and no one else in my family wanted to see it. The movies lately that are being produced just suck. I can't believe that this film got recognized as being one of the best films to come out. Yeah, no. Save yourself some time and money, don't rent babel. Rent a movie that you like, you will be better off.",Babel
603,paul0511,best movie in years,10,2 December 2006,"Just had the pleasure of viewing this remarkably engrossing movie.This is what I call a movie! ,great acting , cinematography , musical score .Usually I have not been a fan of subtitles in a movie but this one has them in quite a lot of scenes but it works brilliantly.It deserves the Oscar for best film . Its a lot better than similar films like Crash etc , The locations and different cultures involved in the story make it very interesting. The way they are all linked is revealed later in the film and is no too difficult to miss .The movie length is over 2 hours but it really passes by quickly as the film is that good.Get yourself a few beers , a pizza ,turn off the lights,the phones,close the curtains and be transported on a magical journey around the world.",Babel
604,thepiscesox,"Seriously, what are you people thinking?",1,11 November 2006,"At least Crash was entertaining and was able to get its message across (even if it was dumbed down to the max)But this new film? This is one of the worst movies I have gone to see a long time. Its like lets just drift around aimlessly, make some plots, fill them with holes, and then give it a happy ending. Oh, and lets have bouncing camera-work and intermittent sound cuts why we are at. Ugh.Its nice to have a good message to want to send to people. The hatred of Muslims and immigrants in this country is a very important issue. But this movie fails completely to really push that message. My acquaintance actually walked out the film, but I stayed through to the end, hoping it would get better. It doesn't. Only reason to go see this film is if you like seeing naked young Japanese girls. (Which I can see on the internet, no need to go to the theater for that thanks)",Babel
605,GUzelac,A Masterpiece,10,4 December 2006,"I will keep this short and sweet. I saw Babel not three days ago, and it blew my mind. The interlocking stories are so well weaved together through imagery, symbolism and story. Innaritu is a genius for working with such a complex storyline and such difficult themes and still making a fabulous film. Also, the acting is superb. The Japanese story involves a deaf mute girl named Chieko, and she is portrayed extremely well. I would not be surprised if at least one of the actors gets a nomination come the Oscars. The locations really complement the movie. the film is set in Mexico, Morocco, and Tokyo, Japan. the locations have a lot of symbolism. Babel definitely deserves an A in my book. Its my Oscar pick for best original screen writing.",Babel

With the tag line reading ""If you want to be understood, listen"", i was excited. But when i started seeing the film it was at best a bad dream. The performances which were(in comparison to the rest of the movie) somewhat good couldn't save the movie. I am not saying this because i am against non-linear story lines or culturally different movies. Its just that this film was extremely confused in its execution. I did not feel for any of the characters, least of all the Japanese segment which was completely useless and disconcerting. The only story i was remotely interested in was the Moroccan one and that also fizzled out. All this film does is stereotype the Un-American world and at this time of the world that has proved to be dangerous. The worst movie of 2006? Yes. The worst movie of the 21st Century(till now)? Probably. Another point. This is for the people who liked Babel--i don't care and have no problems some people like incomplete novice film-making. But the people i do have a problem with are the people who like this movie and feel all that don't like it are lesser in intelligence or lack the ""intellectual thought process"". This film is totally pseudo-intellectual and leaves you with a feeling like that of eating uncooked meat.A film with unlimited potential, but in the end it turned out to be a hollow look at the world.",Babel
607,Smeagol-Gollum,Over long and over rated,4,13 January 2007,"I went to see this movie expected a stunning and beautifully crafted cinematic experience that flawlessly melded 4 tales together. Instead I ended up sitting through what seemed hours of endless tedium. This movie, to be blunt, was boring and badly edited. After about 10 minutes I thought perhaps it would improve, as the beginning was hardly the most engaging thing I've ever sat through. But then it didn't, and just dragged on and on, labouring over pointless detail that just added to the overwhelming sense of self-indulgence this film emanated. The elements of the 4 storied I thought least relevant to the over-all plot were given such care I thought they must go and to contribute something to the final film, instead all they did was add to the boredom as this film dragged on to the point I wished I wasn't there with family and could just get up to leave in disgust. Not only did it labour insignificant points, it failed to resolve other plot elements, such as what the note said or what happened to Sandiego after he sped off into the night. Somehow I feel this movie only got the excellent reviews it did because it starred an Australian actress, and the local critics thought the should support 'homegrown talent' overseas. But that does not explain how it was so well received and did so well elsewhere. I am mystified as to how this horrifically edited, excessively long and thoroughly boring film managed to score any award nominations, and hope that sometime those responsible will see sense and not reward it with a completely undeserved prize. I expected far better from what I heard. An over long and over rated disappointment.",Babel

609,chigekko,Uh ... not sure wtf ...,6,15 April 2007,"Holy cow ... I expected a lot from this movie. Got some. Didn't get it all, though and by a damn site.The good: I've never seen a better performance from Brad Pitt. He was gone ... completely lost and absorbed in the role. Good for him. I'll become a Pitt fan again if he does another bunch of roles like this.Rinko Kikuchi is awesome. Fearless and utterly believable. I will look forward to more work from her.Adriana Barraza ... excellent as the nanny who makes a very unfortunate choice. Great stuff.The Bad: The amazing and capable Cate Blanchett had no role in this film. Should have either saved a bunch of dough and cast an up and comer or, preferably, given her some meat to chew on in this role. C'mon.The Point. What the hell was this movie really trying to say? I appreciated the skillful direction and extremely good to excellent acting and the believable script, but what, exactly, is Inarritu trying to say with this movie? I felt almost the exact same way after watching 21 Grams. Similarly outstanding acting and technically-superb film-making, full of angst, anger, despair and emotion, but what the hell are we talking about? I don't need a theme spoon-fed to me or a trite, happy, Hollywood ending, but both these films seem to reach for some sort of emotional impact that either doesn't come naturally or is too deliberately dark and vague to, actually, have the impact Inarritu was trying to achieve.I dunno. I can say for sure that Inarritu is skilled ... an expert, really and his script is tight and excellently delivered by a great cast. But the overall impact is cold, distant and vague.Do I like this film? I'm not so sure. Do I recommend seeing the movie? Yes. --ML",Babel

Babel indeed.As the movie rolled on, scene after scene with no connection with the last,I started looking at my watch.The gratuity was the final straw. What possible plot purpose has a an Arab boy masturbating, a deaf Japanese teenager revealing her public hair in a bar or the actual killing of a chicken?

I don't really know where to begin with the shortcomings so I'll start with the good points. The movie offered an intriguing piece on life as a Moroccan sheep herder; apparently the boys there enjoy pleasuring themselves as well. The movie showed some young Japanese nudity(I think I just unintentionally convinced some of you to watch this movie). The movie showed some of the best scenes of deserts or desolated plains ever. Oh I guess the acting was actually above average. Now on to the bad: The three stories were tied together but it was so contrived that the culmination of the combination made zero sense. The movie had so many strings untied that I question if there were actually a script in this movie. So many of the characters were not only clichéd but also UNNECESSARY. OK last but not least, this has to be the most depressing movie everEVER. When the movie ended, everyone just left the movie in dead silence, no one even cared to make a joke about how bad it was. It was that BAD. Friends don't let friends watch 'Babel'.",Babel
612,radialdrift,Did anyone notice the plot error,2,7 January 2007,"I found this movie to be a copy of several other films that were released a few years ago. I would of enjoyed the film more if the plot made sense. When Susan ""Cate Blanchett"" is hit in the shoulder, it is her left shoulder and the left window of the bus is cracked. The boy who shot at the bus, shot straight on, aiming for the front of the bus. So unless this is a special bullet that turned right then left before impacting the bus then there must have been another gunman, which this being the case makes the plot of the film redundant.Parts of the film are enduring, lack music and dialog is minimal.

I owned a shotgun at ten, but I received many hours of coaching and numerous threats about hunting out of season and what not to shoot at. Regardless, the boy grew quite proficient to hit that moving target at that distance with a notch sight. That was a stretch, too.Another thread discusses the trajectory of the bullet. Based on the appearance of the hole in the window, I think there was a mistake in the film. How did the bullet get on the left side of the bus? Seems like a boo boo to me.",Babel
614,louisrom,Babel ... or Babble? 2 1/2 hours and scant resolution,5,21 February 2007,"Babel is the latest of Inarratu's broad, sweeping dramas that intertwines the lives of various, diverse characters brought together by chance and circumstance, tied up neatly in the end. Some refer to this film, 21 Grams and Amores Perres as a trilogy, but these three films are no more a trilogy than Babel is an accomplishment. Babel fails where the other two films succeeded -- especially 21 Grams -- in its loose connections, incomplete explanations, and incongruous cut-and-paste storytelling. The main problems with Babel are that ...* The film could have been 30 minutes shorter * We're shown all the connections within the first 30 minutes and there's nothing but strained suspense for the next 2 hours. * The first two might have not mattered if the director gave us characters we gave a damn about. But Inarratu, like a sophomore literature student, takes so much time trying to impress you with his premise he fails to fill the paper/story with the goods to feed that premise, or in this case, plot.The film is cold and detached, unsympathetic and just plain slow. But back to the three main problems.Any good writer knows that less is more ... few carefully chosen words compels more than a bucket of words strewn across the page. To use journalism jargon -- ""every sentence should advance the story, should develop character, set the stage, aid the plot.""Almost the entire series of shots with the nanny watching the American couple's children is pointless. OK, she took the kids across the border, bad decision, kids get deserted (I'll leave it at that).As I said earlier, within 30 minutes I know how everyone is connected. No, it's not particularly sexy or romantic, but I know. So, the next two hours are spent basically figuring out how many of these characters are going to die.And, frankly the only character that I cared about was the Japanese girl, played so powerfully by Rinko Kikuchi. I think she should have received a nomination for best supporting actress. Anyhow, if you read all the acclaim of Babel, about what an accomplishment it was, you may leave this one feeling a bit disappointed. I sure was.",Babel

The whole thing was absolutely boring. I like Bard Pitt but he could have chosen a better role than this. Now I'm thinking he's not very bright either. The movie lets you know that the married couple is having a problem of some sort. By the time the movie ends there never is any clue what their problem is.

I also like that it's not too obvious. My friend, who I went to see this movie with, didn't like it. She didn't understand some of the things, and wasn't used to the jumps in time and place. I am used to it, I like it and I have no problems with it, so it didn't bother me.The film was Beautiful (in filming, editing and thought) and it made me Feel. Not many films can do that nowadays. I have seen so many films that I am jaded. But nonetheless, this film brought a tear to my eye at some points.It made me realize how much I have to be grateful about. It made me really really happy about the life I live today. And it showed me that I'm one of the lucky ones.Although I give this movie a 10 out of 10, I never want to see it again.

This could have been a good movie if the filmmaker had kept in mind that less is sometimes better.Various stories and cultures come together in this film, each interwoven with the others except for one absolutely unrelated and crude Japanese B movie, not even of the same genre, that repetitively interrupts the real movie for no apparent reason. A very weak link is provided that appears contrived, serving virtually no purpose other than being a flimsy excuse for bringing in the otherwise totally irrelevant Japanese movie. Someone of influence in this project must have had a screenplay they could not sell, so they stuck it here.Without this awkward and unnecessary Japanese portion, the film could be otherwise okay, as long as you can accept the incredible string of tragic events that affect the film's protagonists.On a positive note, the acting and direction is excellent.",Babel

I found it to be a film of great interest. There are four locations with four stories; Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the US; each in their language with subtitles.Following the screening, I spoke to the Director who is Mexican, although he is articulate and fluent in English, a much better English than most Americans-, with a good sense of humor. He agreed with my assessment. The film is due to be released in one to two months. I recommend it highly. The photography is gripping, indicative of each culture. Vivid. I think that it is noteworthy. In the remote locations, he selected and worked with non-professional, untrained actors. Just plain people who are indicative of their culture.

In particular I liked: The Mexican wedding...I wanted to cry (The best part is when the bridegroom is thrown into the air and then hangs in the air above screen. For a moment you think maybe he floats away. I immediately thought of 'magical realism.') The mother is so nostalgic to her world that is just hours, or even minutes, south of her.I also liked the redemption of relationships between the Japanese girl and her father, and of course Brad's Character and Cate's character. What a beautiful embrace that leads to forgiveness.I did feel that it was overall a little on the pessimistic side. Of course immigration sucks, and the technological advanced world isolates us from one another. What do we do with that? Where is the door out? How will we live with one another, and communicate?",Babel
620,jbgfinance,More about how stupid and self centred people are.,5,18 January 2007,"I just watched the film and the impression I get is the film is about how stupid and selfish most people are. I have lived in the 3rd world for years; there isn't a caring father, and Ibrahim is one, who would give a gun to his sons without careful coaching first. The treatment of peasants and poor people in general by the police is to the point though. As for Brad Pitt, his character needs to redeem himself. The incident provides him with the opportunity to do so and he barges into it. The choice of going to see the village doctor against a 3 hour drive in the coach to the hospital is a fair one given she was bleeding and he did not know her condition and if she would survive the journey.The tourists are typical of western tourists. Voyeurs and profiteers not willing to take time to interact with the locals and always centred on their own enjoyment, detached from the suffering around them as long as THEY are having a good time. Always peering at others from their pedestal( in this case a coach) at 'lower' forms of life.Only happy in their sanitised environment which let's face it most western tourists look for when travelling (except Ozzies and Kiwis who have my deepest affection). Chieko is lost without her mother who gave her a lot of attention; because she herself was not getting any from her husband who is always busy working or hunting.With her father not being there for her, Chieko seeks solace from men, to fill the emotional emptiness in her life and her absent father. I don't believe there was incest. The balcony scene is just a reconciliation. Father and daughter grieve together the loss of the mother and their own long separation.",Babel

It left no impression on me whatsoever..The realization of how great and deep this movie really is came after the second viewing. After having opened my eyes and my ears and my heart. I cannot even put this into words..Feelings are hard to describe. This film is like a mirror. You look at it and see yourself..Unwilling to listen, unwilling to understand, but always willing to speak and BE understood. It shows us how alone we are in this world and we become more isolated in spite(or because) of globalization. We are all deaf and mute like Chieko...I could feel her pain almost physically..What shocked me was the story with the European tourists. What shocked me is that that's how it really is...No one needs anyone. Even when tragedy strikes..Those people left them alone, alone with their tragedy..But there were people who stayed, people who helped, people who didn't speak the same language but chose to understand.This film is so deep and multidimensional and moving that it's pointless to even try to describe.

622,mroseberry99,My favorite movie in quite sometime,9,26 January 2007,"I have yet to see anyone comment on, what I believe to be the most important connection in the movie, the fact that one single gun, connects all four of the families portrayed in this movie through pain and sorrow. It negatively impacts each of the families tremendously, one of which didn't come within thousands of miles of the gun. Remove it from the equation and the boy doesn't ""accidentally"" shoot the American woman; the boy's brother wouldn't have been killed by the police as there wouldn't have been an investigation to the shooting; the American kids wouldn't have been traumatized at being left alone in the desert and the nanny wouldn't have been deported since the American couple would have been home on schedule; Chieko's mother wouldn't have shot herself in the head. Remove the one gun and remove the grief and sorrow. This is a little simplistic as there are other issues and a lot of other messages in the movie(family values, racism, stupidity, bad judgement, etc.) but i saw the gun as the prominent underlying motif throughout the movie. The message being, look how a single gun caused so much pain across the world, multiply that by all the guns in the world and you get the point. I believe the director clearly believes that guns should be destroyed before it is too late as depicted in the powerful scene of the boy smashing the rifle against the rocks after his brother is killed by the police. Unfortunately, for him, it was too late.",Babel
623,a_dexterrace007,"Wonderful theme,but not as wonderful as Crash",6,7 January 2007,"I really like this kind of storytelling style, in which a story of intertwined events happens,such as 21 Grams,whose director is also Alejandro González Iñárritu, Pulp Fiction,Crash. As for Crash,I want to talk more. lots of people compare Babel with Crash, for both reflect culture shock, explore inward human nature,and give audience a hope to modern society, more importantly ,Crash won the Best Picture and Babel has been getting rave reviews in the media and has a big chance to win it this year. In my opinion, Babel is a brilliant movie, but not as wonderful as Crash.There is no doubt that miscommunication is the theme of Babel, which is conveyed well in three separate story lines. In the first line,the miscommunication between husband(Brad Pitt) and wife, the husband and other tourists(although it is not about language,it is about feeling), the husband and local government; in the second, the Mexican immigrants and police officer;in the third,the deaf teenage Japanese girl and the indifferent world around her. Each story is a proof topic for us to think over,language leads to a gap, but is it the only reason for this gap? I like this theme.But the three separate stories are not well interlocked or organized, in other words, there is little connection among them.While Crash does this well.The hopelessness of that deaf teenage girl has nothing to do with the gun shot story happens in Moroccan desert.Just because that rifle her father gave to a hunter in Moroccan desert is not reason for putting the two stories together.And the reason why the girl's mother suicides is not clear, which only reminds me that Japan is a high-rate suicide nation; the Mexcian event happens after the event in Moroccan desert,but there is no link.In short, it is a good movie and worth seeing if you always like thinking something deeper.",Babel
624,twoheartedriver,An exercise in tedium,4,13 November 2006,"An excruciatingly boring and pointless attempt to make an art film. I rarely feel the urge to walk out of a movie but it was all I could do to sit though this one. I'm tired of so-called ""auteurs"" attempting to dazzle us with their prowess behind the camera, and believing we are too afraid to reject their product for fear that we ""might not get it."" Every movie should tell a story, preferably in the three-act structure. Working outside that structure is fine, but you better have a story to tell, or you will sink in a quagmire of imagery without content and unrealized expectations. Alejandro González Iñárritu just barely pulled it off with ""21 Grams"" but failed miserably with Babel. The thrust of the film is we are all interconnected.

The cinematography was great, especially in Morrocco and Japan. I think that the film would be very deserving of some technical awards. The plot and the characters in Morrocco and Japan were beautifully scripted and filmed. What totally ruined it for me was that the Americans had to end up safely back in the the good old U S of A. The Brad Pitt/Cate Blanchett characters survived their desert holiday. Why were they in Morrocco anyway? Their children survived their Mexico/desert excursion but their illegal immigrant nanny was deported. The innocent goat farmer lost both of his sons because he bought a gun to help protect his herd from predators. So the Arabs/Muslims suffer and the Americans always prevail. It seems to me that the major part of plot was crafted to satisfy the US market. This movie could have been a great movie.

If you're the type that likes 90% violin soundtracks, movies with no ups and downs, only downs (the wedding scene is kept tense, as the director was afraid of any joy in the film), this may be for you.We felt the characters were all undeveloped and unsympathetic, with only tenuous connections, one subplot almost like filler (so the guy in japan gave away his rifle... hardly enough to justify 1/3 of the story spent on his horny/lonely daughter).I certainly can't recommend this movie.

629,Tmoneyc,Brilliant,10,9 April 2007,"This was a film about parents and their children. It was a good way of showing many different kinds of parent-children relationships. The directing was very powerful and symbolic. The whole movie was like an essay. You start an essay off with an introduction, that brings the readers into the essay, and support your thesis with body paragraphs, and further sum your thesis up with a conclusion. It showed the Parent-Children relationships in the beginning and how they were very ""lacking"" and in need of more attention. Later on, problems arised, the cops were after the Arabic family, The American Tourist could not find a hospital, The kids were stuck in Mexico, And the Japanese Deaf girl was going through desperation for romance. It showed how much the parent characters needed their kids and vice versa. Finally it ended with summing everything, and the deaf Japanese Girl with her father in the balcony, basically showing us that the whole story was resolved and that we do need our parents/children in our lives. No matter how much we deny it. That ending scene was very powerful and I adulate the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for being able to pull this off.The cinematography was also very powerful. When the Border police was chasing the Illegal Immigrants, usually a director would put a lighting there, to let US know where they're going, but in Babel on the other hand, they director and cinematographer made the whole place dark and all we can see are the headlights of the car. That's exactly what they were seeing and that's how they were feeling; lost. That was plus point in cinematography. There was also a scene in which the deaf girl was having fun with her friends. At one point she was on the swings. The camera only focused on her face and the facial expressions. What does that mean? That simply is trying to tell us that since she is deaf, she can not hear anything around her, and at that moment, she was not paying attention to her surroundings, it was just her and her enjoyment. That angle for the camera was very symbolic, and another thumbs up for the film.Back to the directing, The directing that scene in which the deaf girl is enjoying herself was well done. It was a ""moment of silence."" We saw how much the girl enjoyed herself yet she could not hear anything, neither could we in many parts of the scene. Inarritu basically allowed us to put ourselves in her shoes. Notice the cool lighting in the club, but no music. In reality we know there is music in the club, but in her world, there is no sound whatsoever. That was very well done.Also the acting of everybody was realistic. The whole movie felt real. It was an amazing film. My favorite officially, because of that swinging scene.",Babel

631,rdhad,Drivel,1,28 January 2007,"An interesting plot device was used in this film - instead of heightened tension, the viewer is sent into a continuously downward emotional spiral. Instead of really caring about any of the characters, you just become resigned to the inevitable depressing unraveling of their lives. Oh wait a minute. That was just for the poor people. The rich people actually come out mostly OK...huh.I am amazed that there have not been massive complaints from Morrocans. The two boys guarding their goat herd are portrayed as incestuous idiots - BOTH of them think it is perfectly OK to shoot at moving vehicles containing people just to see how far bullets from their high-powered rifle will go. And even more amazingly, even though the kid shoots at the tourist bus from the right hand side - he manages to hit Cate Blanchett from a window on the opposite side of the bus directly into her left shoulder. Perhaps the director thought it would diminish his insulting portrayal of the Morroccan family if they were at least superhuman marksmen.The Japanese story line was the most interesting, and most poignant - and the most tenuously related to the rest of what was going on. A rather silly way to attach it to the rest of the movie, actually. I walked out of the theatre feeling like I had wasted my time and my money. Amazingly, this one-trick pony of a plot with a glaring continuity error will probably walk away with all sorts of Academy awards. Confirming that the Oscar process is a load of babel itself.",Babel
632,luminauru,Babel really opened my eyes!,10,25 November 2006,"It is so interesting to read comments on Babel. I'm starting to think that the film itself is speaking with a special language that is not so much based on form and rationality(loud, masculine) but is more intuitive and feeling(silent, feminine). If one is not able to receive this language of silence(should I say a language of pure connection) one will be left very cold. Maybe this happens because the way one is used to communicate with a film just doesn't work this time! This time we must fall silent and receive without measuring and analyzing at the same time. Through this collection of moving images, called Babel, my eyes were once again opened to see what is really happening around the world right now! Also I was able to understand very accurately the real reasons for the chaotic and messy situation of humankind.We are all-together on this planet and every little conscious choice for a better world matters. And the other way around, every little unconscious action or a ""running away"" from self or one's own emotional situation can cause disharmony elsewhere. Babel is a powerful mirror for the whole humankind. Everybody should see this film, not looking for entertainment but looking for an accurate general picture of the real problems of our ""civilization"".Thanks to Babel, I want to be more conscious with my actions towards other human beings.",Babel
633,atouk-3,Good Grief....,5,28 November 2006,"OK, I liked the movie (Would somebody please have sex with the Japanese girl already!) but I just could not get past the liberal overtones of the largest issues we all hear about every day. The message that the movie is jamming down the viewers throat is that guns are bad, illegal aliens are all suffering at the hands of neanderthal boarder guards and hunters are going to somehow cause your demise. That's a blanket description but it summarizes the absurd message Hollywood tries to make in this and it seems, every POC movie they release from their studios like s**t falling from a cow's a**. The only reason they pick such hot topics and sensationalize them is because the truthful facts are rather boring.1. Your children (and anyone else for that matter) are in much greater danger when they or you visit a friend that owns a swimming pool, not a gun. The fatality ratio for swimming pools to guns is just about 100:1. Imagine Hollywood trying to sensationalize swimming pool deaths. Hunting and guns are part of the reason you're able to be where you are in the first place. Hmm..now that I think about it, cars kill more people than guns. So does the common cold, the flu and aspirin. Great material for a sensational movie plot, huh?2. Illegal aliens are just that, ILLEGAL. You should not feel sorry for them when they come here, make a life illegally at taxpayers expense and then get deported. Lets take care of our own first, folks. If life in Mexico sucks so badly and their leaders are such tyrants, Mexicans should band together and change things the way Americans did for themselves 200+ years ago. Don't come here illegally and expect Americans to look the other way. Any American that busts his or her butt for whatever they own or gain should wake up and smell the coffee.Other than the politically correct BS that the movie tries to drive home, it's another fine, run of the mill, same ol' same ol' flick. I guess I shouldn't take it to heart, thinking that people pay any attention to actors and their deep pocket drivel. After all, it ""IS"" only a movie...""thank goodness for usenet releases and unsecured WiFi connections from a neighboring Hotel""",Babel
634,iaxa,A film about the price of life,10,30 November 2006,"Babel is IMHO one of the best ""big"" productions of the past few years. What makes it special is a authenticity in portraying the life in modern world and puts a question-mark to the phenomenon of globalization as we see it. The non-heroic characters are taken from a everyday life, although the events itself are a bit extraordinary, but far from unlikely. The interconnected characters that equally share their importance for the film, range from Moroccan shepherds to adolescent deaf mute daughter of a Japanese businessman. In portraying the whole mental and communication distance between extremely rural Arab desert and hyper urban Tokyo or upper mid-class American versus a Mexican immigrant, the director exposes a whole spectrum of differences and more important the similarities between the characters. The traumatic events seen in the film involve the political (terrorist witch-hunt,immigration) and social (parent-child relations, identity crisis) issues. It is also a story how senselessly tragedies of individuals become a news on the other side of the world and nevertheless questions the different price of a human life in different ""worlds"". Thumbs up for the actors including the ""star"" Brad Pitt, who often performs in many stereotypically uninteresting Hollywood blockbusters, but never gives up more challenging roles, making this one no exception.",Babel

I like ""requiem for a dream"", ""crash"" etc coz they are still sensible, but this one amazed me with its stupidity.What's my point? Have you ever realized that the average IQ of the character in this movie is below 80? Every ""tragedy"" occurred on them is brought to them by themselves in the circle of karma, and they deserve every single bit of it. In another word, no one in this movie deserves compassion. Not even the kids, coz they are phony manipulative character faked by the director. You may find excuses for the mistakes ""Pitt"" character made in this movie (vaguely arguable), but what are the excuses for the others? The only purpose of this movie is to see how idiots screw up their lives, and that's all about it. And such a movie can win the golden globe? Winning the golden globe means: ""good effort, but not there yet,"" but this movie doesn't even deserve that. The whole movie is a stupid and phony story, and there are so many preachy manipulation in this movie, but why no one sees it? How do you people buy it? My personal worst movie is ""dogville"", and this one is the runner-up. Form ""21 gram"" I noticed Alejandro González Iñárritu is a mediocre preachy guy full of phony ideas and lacks something essential in his morality, and this movie is just openly showing them in the public.

It looked like one of those movies I normally wait to come out on DVD before I watch. However, after it received a healthy amount of Golden Globe nominations and generated good reviews online, I knew I had to check it out sooner.A gut-wrenching tale of the hardships people can encounter in their lives because of miscommunication, Babel definitely deserves its Best Picture nomination. Stellar performances across the board really help display every emotion the characters are experiencing.

From my standpoint, the main theme running through the story is that physical distances do not necessarily isolate people from each other and our planet is truly a global community. In other words, the actions of one person and affect someone far away before you know it.While the actress playing the young Japanese schoolgirl was very good, I am not sure what she brought to the story by illustrating her personal issues. Maybe there is a connection there but I do not see it.It's not necessarily an uplifting film but I do not think it was meant to be that. Also, while the non-linear style has been done before it is appreciated and works well within the story.All of the performances were first rate and this is an important movie deserving of all the awards it can earn.",Babel

There are no relevant similarities between the substance of this movie and Syriana.Pulp Fiction, Syriana, Traffic have similar styles of story telling. This story sucked. ""If You Want to be Understood...Listen"" Is that what this movie was about? Why not do it on something a little less obvious like if people don't drink water they die? Trust me, a second bonus for those that said this was a good movie would be a lot of unnecessary pain and emotion in 2 hours of someone dying of thirst while there loved ones watched.I got the movie, its just that there was not a whole lot to get:1) Actions, even innocent or good intentioned, sometimes have bad consequences. 2) Different cultures and governments have trouble communicating and co-operating. Wow, thats new and deep.Here is my suggestion to the people who say this is an important movie: Go read the paper, watch the news, go out and see the real world you have been cooped up in bubble for too long. For those that want to stay in the house and see a better movie about communication see ""The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara""; Its real, it has many more valuable lessons and is interesting (based on Vietnam War lessons)!

640,thethunder,Babel was a thought-provoking and emotionally moving beauty of a film.,9,13 March 2007,"This was, all in all, a stunning, and moving film. It's a Hollywood pic (to the best of my knowledge), for sure, but it tries its best to come off as an indie film, and almost entirely succeeds. It combined some truly superb acting with an excellent, yet simple, story, as well as a deep, important message.So what's so special about these stories that won this film all of it's notoriety, and my eye? Nothing especially. They are all stories of people and families caught by the circumstances of fate, yet, at the same time, all interconnected by their fates, and by their struggles. It's this connectedness that makes this film great. These stories are all effects and causes of each other, but I'll leave that for you to see. The events of these stories are almost like butterfly effects of each other, if that helps you understand what I mean by 'they are all connected'. The actions of one story affect the actions of another. The plots twist and curl around each other to form an amazing vine. But a vine with a message.Honestly, I don't want to give too much of the film away, lest I ruin it, so skip ahead some if you don't want to hear too much, as I'm only going to say what I feel that the message of the film is. Basically, the message is small and sweet, but powerful, as it's wound so delicately in the vines of the plot. It's a message of struggle, and how our struggles bring us together. It's a message of how our cultures across the globe differ, what is accepted here, may not be accepted somewhere else, for instance, and through this, we are not only different, but closer through our differences. We all inhabit this planet. We all are human. And in this, we are all the same, no matter what twists of fate we encounter. It's almost as if the film states that our struggles make us human, and our struggles are how we are all related, and how we are all connected on a higher level.Now you want to know why this film earns its stars. I gave it a 4.5/5 star rating for several reasons. The main reasons were the technical aspects of the movie, an excellent screenplay, and some beautiful camera work, as well as exceptional acting. But these technical portions all blend together to form a beautiful and aesthetically and emotionally moving piece. The film doesn't have an impact, it is an impact. It's message it strong, it's message is thrown at you by it's story, and it's message is what this movie exists for. That's why this film earns it's stars. It's only lacking that little bit of cohesiveness, really nothing to worry too much about. It's also a very raw film, there's a substantial amount of nudity, though not too much. It's this rawness that helps push the message, but took that last 1/2 star away.Really, see it. I highly recommend it. It's a must, and it's message is powerful.",Babel
641,ajars,"A realistic,poignant and a humanist film",9,5 January 2007,This is one of the most poignant films that I have seen in recent times. The story that unfolds in Morocco rings so true that it is almost like watching a documentary.It is extremely unfortunate but such a situation prevails now in many places in the world that are real and not part of any movie set. The role of Elsie is also superbly etched. This actress deserves to get the Best supporting actress award.The film makes a strong social commentary without being judgmental at any stage.These stories of simple people caught in situations beyond their control is so true to life. The only point is whether such films can actually make any difference to the way people think and behave.In any case the director has made a tremendous effort in that direction.,Babel
642,henrik-227,Epic on a human level,10,26 January 2007,"This could really be 2 or 3 films. The script is so rich and the characters and situations are as faceted as the various continents the film spans. This is not trying to be an epic film, but shows that each one of us is an epic. Human nature is base but beautiful in his films. Babel is as the name would indicate about language and communication. The deaf girl's greatest problem is not that she is unable to talk and hear but she is unable to connect with her father. The couple in Morocco; there is so much they should be saying but they choose not to until disaster strikes. The communication at this point is all the more poignant. The nanny is unable to let the kids parents know that she has to take them to Mexico, and afterwards completely unable to let them know what her intentions were.All is underlined by the unusual framing of the scenes and a touch of music that really keeps the film alive.The film has a wonderful sense of leaving an empty page for the viewer, the letter the deaf girl wrote, what did it say? How did the kids get rescued etc?A truly genius film by a script writer and director who must be truly passionate about what they do.",Babel
643,frazier116,The brothers...,10,23 January 2007,"First of all i want to say that the two brothers in this film are the most affective part of the film. The brother-ship between those two was going deeply to our consciences. Some may say that this two were so rude that they whispered each others and shooting round the hills but that is the special part of their brother-ship and the film is telling us that with so professional way. Especially when Yussef said that ""I killed the American, I was the only one who shot at you. They did nothing... nothing. Kill me, but save my brother, he did nothing... nothing. Save my brother... he did nothing."" We just couldn't hold ourselves. If we have to say another scene about the brothers, it will be the scene that when they stand against the wind. This flashback scene is so sensitive. After all if i need to say something more, Bergman already said what i wanted to tell..""Film as music,film as dream.No art passes our consciences in the way film does..""",Babel
644,fatemehkamaly,Putting four stories together from four countries makes a global sphere in Babel that accounts the insecure world for Americans.,10,7 April 2007,"Three years after popular 21 Gram, the new production of Alejandro González Iñárritu , Babel, came to the world maybe more popularity! This time we heard that this film is Islamic phobic and representation of uncivilized violence in East. After seeing the film I found that some of the comments about it are not so true, this film is world phobic if we mind America in the separate side.The narrative of this film suburb on a gun shot to an American tour bus which goes to visit Morocco, and fallows by showing a part of Japanese school girl whose father gave the gun to a Moroccan family, during the film also an American family who deals with the gun shot and a Mexican family that one of them is watcher of American children (kids of the couple who travels to Morocco), are represented.I think modernity and the process of its entrance to world's countries is main point for contributing Babel. The face of Modernity in one hand and the consequences of Modernity in the other hand are bold representation of feeling security in the Babel's created world.In Babel's world, Morocco is not modern society, the structure of community is primitive, the families live in deserts or houses are plastered with cob, is not rational separation among family life, sexual life and entertainments. Japan but is modern society, with tall buildings, big highways, luxury clubs, developed digital systems like screen saver phone and finally great welfare for citizens. Mexico has different representation, keeping traditional costumes in parallel of trying to join modernity, is represented clearly in the wedding party of the watcher's son. And finally America, the poor Americans who are worry about their security at the first moments of their representation. The face of modernity is complete in the American representation, for example encourages using of pure water in travel or supporting the security of citizens with checking the cars at night and requesting the parent's permission for bringing the children to Mexico.It could be said that the representation of modernity just in American version has deeply layers but in Japan we see it apparently! Modernity in Japan with Babel's views has wonderful manifestation, so wonderful that even we didn't see it in representation of America, but this context has another mean, the process of modernization is not completed in Japan! I mean the philosophy of circulation of modernity in the world is criticized by Babel. How does Modernity publish in the world? What does the elements of modernity? Who are publishing elements of modernity? Who are using the elements? And what are the consequences of this process? There are main questions of this narrative. The questions which just are asked but in half answered and even some of them leave unanswered.In the face of modernity we see that Americans receive to a stage that make suitable and supported situation for themselves in their country, such a stage that they want to aware of their outside. But the entire world is shown in Babel unsecured, because of the incomplete circulation of modernity! Supplying the gun for a Morocco family by a Japan man, injuring American woman in Morocco or wandering American children in frontier's dry deserts between Mexico and USA, the problem of sexual relationship for Moroccan boy and Japans girl and inability to solve this human instinct (in both society, civilized or uncivilized), and finally representing the role of Police in all of the societies are not accidental events, they are meaningful. The clear message is this: although Americans join to modernity themselves without problem (as in film we don't see any problems in American society in this way), but it is not meaning that they don't have any challenge with entire incomplete modernized world! So it could be said that Babel represents the American society in exceptional side of the other three societies, the society which fell insecurity and rights in it. Babel in the other words notifies the potential dangerous for continuing this circulation of modernity in the world, warning for world's people and of course for Americans.Babel although is successful in representing some problems of global modernity in the world but its representatives are so spiteful, especially in Morocco that is contributed as an Islamic society. Also Babel has total timid and worried character for introducing Americans that is not true, even the Americans who are in the tour bus as representatives of American society are white and speak English but this is not true representation of American multicultural society! Babel although wins to draw audience's attention to different life style in four countries and connecting them approximately, but it doesn't have acceptable answer for them; leaving Japans girl satisfied with his father talks, killing the boys and their father in Morocco and putting the Mexican woman out of job and finally the project of surviving the American family, are defrauding ends that not only confuse audience but also insults their intelligence perception.In fact I think Babel with all of the attempts to not titling American role could do it under the layers of the narrative, and creates a big question: What could be done for Americans in this insecure world?",Babel

What happened to the Mexican lady's, Amelia's, nephew, Santiago? Oh and what did that note say that the Japanese girl gave the policeman? Also that girl was crazy. Why did she tell the policeman that her mom jumped off the balcony? This movie was just way to confusing. And at the end she was naked, hugging her dad. He wasn't weirded out or anything. I'm guessing that the one Morrocan boy died, and I have no idea what the government would do to the other boy because he was a minor. I truly do not understand why critics say this movie was so good.

You may ask why I even bother talking about the speakers but you will know what I mean if you have seen Alejandro González Iñárritus previouse movie called 21 Grams. I also highly recommend that movie for anyone who likes Alejandro González Iñárritus directing style. If you are not comfortable with reading subtitles, this is not the movie for you. The movie uses seven different languages including English. The languages used are English, French, Spanish, Berber, Arabic, Japanese, and Japanese sign language.

Iñárritu seems to be saying that however separated peoples may be by their languages, cultures, and belief systems, they are nevertheless closely connected, at least in the sense that a random act in one place can have huge consequences for individuals in others.My first thought on the title, relative to the biblical Tower of Babel, was that it was intended ironically, suggesting that contrary to the non-communication implied by the Genesis story (Chapter 11), everyone is nevertheless very closely linked. But if the title was meant ironically, I'm not sure that it works, for the ""link"" portrayed in ""Babel"" is rather dysfunctional, and the point of the Genesis story seems to be that the divisions among people prevent them from coming together constructively. On that reading, it appears that the movie's title isn't ironic at all but rather functions as a label to describe our dysfunctional world, in which the primary connection among disparate people is destructive, tragic.",Babel

There is so much respect the film accords to the intelligence of the audience... you are to think, and you are to keep thinking, feeling; large scale, deep thinking required!

In an effort to seek the supposed terrorists that shot at the foreigners and pacify the angry political outrage, the trigger-happy local law enforcement gun down the 11yr old son as he, his brother and father were getting away from their home. This story was so depressing and so contrived and utterly absurd reality. When I want absurd reality I watch some sci-fi or senseless comedy/horror flick, not this. And all the other plots were no better. Plot 2 - The Japanese hunter has a deaf- mute daughter who witnessed her mom shooting herself in the head, really mr. writer? And although she has a great social life with other deaf girls - playing on a volleyball team and partying together, she craves the attention of boys and is willing to go to extreme lengths to get their attention like take her undies off at a restaurant, pulls the male obgyns hand forcibly to her vag at the doc visit, invite a cop over to discuss her moms death but walks out naked in the living room in front of him, and attempts to have sex with him. These are so ridiculous. WTF am I supposed to take away from this Oscar nominated BS of a script other that pure disgust. And I'm not even going to talk about the stupidity of the Mexican nanny with the 2 white American kids trying to cross the border with no documentation. But the acting was great and contrasting scenery of the intertwined plots and direction was pretty cool, that doesn't mean this was an awesome movie, the straight to DVD American Pie movies made more sense than this. However, if yr looking for absurdly contrived and utterly depressing, this is the movie for you.",Babel
656,SmutVendetta,what a waste of time,1,7 March 2008,"I can't believe I wasted damn near 3 hours of my life on this crap called a movie. Entertainment? None at all, I'd rather go watch grass blow in the wind, toddlers eat their boogers, watch a group of men masturbate on each other, watch an old man age for 40 years - die of old age - mold, decay, rot, become one with the earth, watch mold grow on bread, or watch a man sit on a bench feeding pigeons. I'd rather eat my own fesces than watch this movie again, I would give George Dubbya Bush a mighty fine blow job before even thinking of watching this movie again, hell I'd probably swallow. I only watched this movie up to the end thinking the end would make up for the boringness, but of course, nooooo, nope, a boring plot, boring naive characters that don't develop at all. If I would have had to paid to see this movie, I'd probably have wrote letter to the stupid bastard who wrote it and demanded some money back, I've never seen such boring trash in my life, ever! Crappy movies like, Hannibal are better than this incredible steaming pile of crap.",Babel
657,evandc1,So pointless it hurts,5,15 November 2006,"I found this film to be shockingly bad. Through Babel the audience follows the parallel and (sometimes loosely) related stories of an American couple in Morocco, their children & nanny in California, a pair of brothers also in Morocco and a deaf-mute teenage girl in Tokyo. I was hoping for and expecting this film to deliver some kind of message or food for thought. It doesn't.The only ""theme"" --if one can be found at all-- in this film is that of pure stupidity. The characters do head-slappingly idiotic things all the time in order to maintain some kind of drama. That's it.There was no message about language, cross-cultural communication, universal humanity. Nothing. The film is long, slow, and to top it all off, after waiting it out (nearly walking out on the film several times) there was nothing to show for it at the end. The only thread of the story that seemed even slightly rewarding at the end of the film was that of the girl in Japan. Perhaps her story would have made a quality short film, but it couldn't do much to rescue the rest of this garbage film.I am utterly convinced that the only reason this movie has even a half decent rating so far on IMDb is that pretentious people are saying they like it because they think it is the hip and sophisticated thing to do. ""Amores Perros"" was a good film. Despite being over-hyped and a little to blunt with its message, ""Crash"" was worthwhile too. ""Babel"" is basically a sh** film that is surviving on its star power and the pretensions of its audience.",Babel

I am really shocked that Brad Pitt took this role. Maybe he was having a bad hair day when called for this one. The folks who carry on about how great this film is must be very shallow.

If you've never been 'lost,' particularly in a society you don't understand, you can never feel the full impact that the simple inability to communicate renders. It's overwhelming; 'Babel' brought it all back, and, for better or worse, I relived the panic as I watched it, brought on by a simple lack of ability to communicate the most basic human needs in a society that doesn't even begin to identify them in the same way.

664,mattyaloo,"""Important"" = Pretentious",2,14 November 2006,"First - I gave this movie 3 stars because it deserves at least a little bit of credit for some wonderful contrasting visual images. A Mexican wedding, the stark Moroccan desert and the vibrancy of Tokyo all juxtapose very well and keep the audience awake despite a painfully slow, direction-less and absurdly simplistic storyline.I have read some of the other reviews on this page describing this film as ""powerful"" and ""important"" which are usually good warning signs that it's generally uninteresting, long, pretentious and unclear as to it's message (if it even has one).I honestly think this movie was even more pretentious, simplistic and boring than ""The English Patient"", another ""important"" and ""powerful"" movie. lol.I had a really great English prof who once said to me: When writing an essay or telling a story, a simple straightforward statement is usually much more effective than flowery BS. In the case of this movie, I would argue the basic statements here are:1. ""It's tough being a deaf-mute teenager in Tokyo."" 2. ""Don't give weapons as gifts to Moroccan desert dwellers."" 3. ""Even though it's tough to take care of your shot wife in rural second world Africa where nobody speaks your language, some people might actually help you."" 4. ""If you're an illegal immigrant nanny in San Diego, don't take the boss's kids across into Mexico then try to cross back into the USA with your drunk nephew driving.""Anyone who has traveled even a little bit will look at this film as a gratuitous attempt to illustrate the vast ""diffrences between cultures"". But the film falls short - I wasn't impressed or enthralled to see the ""shock"" in the face of the young white kids when discovering that rural Mexicans behead chickens - it wasn't a major revelation in this viewers world. Nor was I impressed that the young Moroccan kid masturbates while picturing his naked sister because he has no other sexual outlet in his desolate life. Nor was it a major coup to reveal that teenage girls sometimes wear no panties or other stunts to gain the attention of teenage boys.These and similar other scenes were neither shocking, intriguing, interesting or even unusual.Besides the basic human desire to see the tourist wife live, the Japanese girl not kill herself and the Mexican woman make it home safely, I otherwise left the theater wondering: ""why do I care about any of what I just saw?""If the answer lies in some mystic exploration of a global, local or intimate communication void, I missed it.Deaf-Mutes teen girls have trouble communicating?

I gave it a 1 simply because there was no lower rating. This Liberal/Progressive propaganda piece should be exposed for what it is, GARBAGE. From the ""Ugly American"" stereotype played by Brad Pitt, to the sympathetic ILLEGAL immigrant Nanny, to the nonsensical incestuous voyeurism in Morocco, to the even more nonsensical borderline pedophilia in Japan, we the viewer are dragged through sewerage.

Unfortunately that's not the case. It is not clear to me what went wrong during the making of this film, because it did have what it takes to do well, but I just didn't like it. Most importantly it's incredibly long. There are many scenes which don't contribute a thing. If only everyone learned from Coppola on The Godfather, a movie in which every second has significance... The movie tells three different stories, but one of them is barely related to the others. In addition the nudity and the other sexual parts are uncalled for and not needed at all. So when you walk out of the theatre after watching this film you just can't figure out the point of it. Sure, there are movies which aren't mean to have a point, but a minimal viewer's interest should be kept, which clearly didn't happen to me in this movie.

During one of the extra drawn out Japan scenes, I actually started day-dreaming in the theater.Acting was great. Cinematography was great. Music was fine.

It seems really difficult to justify this movie without giving away spoilers, but this movie is about human relations. Pay close attention to the reactions of different people and the world.Notice the difference between how the world stops everything they are doing to sympathize for the white couple, but no one even bats an eye for the Mexican. Notice how the white tourists are incredibly distrusting of the Moroccans, but it is the Moroccans who provide unparalleled hospitality to the white couple, while the white tourists literally abandon them in the desert. Notice how the white tourists are just hopelessly sick because the A/C isn't turned on while a woman is slowly bleeding to death yards away.That's really just a preview of what this movie has to offer. There are countless themes in this movie, which might be to its disadvantage. For example, the Japanese storyline really isn't as closely related to the rest of the storyline, but it's fulfilling its own purpose in illustrating the level of isolation.Culturally, the world, and definitely America in particular, really needs to grow up. Many of the negative reviews are hilarious evidence of that. I'm willing to bet most of these reviews are from people who are probably white and very comfortable and don't have to worry about whether or not they will be deported because they want to see their son's wedding.If you were looking for something more like the Avengers or if you empty your drool cup at least once a minute, then you definitely should avoid this movie.",Babel

It's fairly long, and it deserves to be watched carefully. Yes, it is convoluted, but it's supposed to be. I think Inarritu does a remarkable job of involving the viewer in the film. From the U.S. to Morocco, from Japan to Mexico, he's telling these interwoven stories. Seems like a long shot, but I think he brings it off. Someone else said Cate Blanchett was wasting her time in this film. Not at all; she's one of the finest actresses around. Her presence is proof that she believed in Inarritu's project.

The film attempts to imitate the style of those two films, but falls flat on its face, because it does not know what made those films work (namely, a message).The lavish cinematography and stellar performances are wasted. After watching all of these characters go to hell and back, we are none the wiser, nor do we care about them. There are no dimensional characters. They have no free will. We don't love them or hate them, because there is nothing about them to love or hate. There is nothing that unifies their struggles, no common flaw or cosmic irony. All the film does is showcase random events in random countries, offering no insight to any of them. Thus, it is trivial.For those who are as intrigued by the movie's premise as I was, you will be sorely disappointed to learn it is false advertising. Babel claims to be about something that it is not about because it does not know what it is about. In reality, it is not about anything.Those who believe that this film accomplishes what it sets out to do are biased by having read the film's synopsis, and not having used their own judgment as they watch the film. If you scrutinize the actions of the characters, you will find that majority of the conflicts have nothing to do with language. That was just a label they slapped onto the film to make it sound like it was about something.Six different taglines were associated with Babel before release. Only one tagline deals with the theme of language. Among the other taglines were: ""A global disaster"" (a too-accurate description), ""Tragedy is Universal"" and ""One shot, many kills"" The marketers cleverly realized that such broad taglines would leave the movie vulnerable to accusations of being overly ambitious and scatterbrained. Thus they chose language as the common ""theme"", hoping that this would cause viewers to look for (and ultimately, imagine) language as the common thread in the stories. Apparently it worked. More proof for the placebo effect.There is a tremendous amount of hype surrounding this movie right now due to the Oscar's and the popularity of the better movies it tries to knock off. However, time distinguishes good movies from bad ones, so I think in the years to come Babel will be forgotten.But that would be unfortunate. Babel should be remembered, by being enshrined forever in film history, as a case study on how NOT to make a movie. That this film received an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay, with one of the most atrocious screenplays ever committed to film, speaks to the impact of good marketing on a movie's success.But all the world's marketing genius can't overcome story-telling this lousy.",Babel

Although I like the cinematography and the acting, the film lacks soul and purpose. I was expecting something a bit shallow having seen the trailer but I am most disappointed to find out I was right about my intuition. Amores Perros managed to intertwine stories and characters brilliantly, but the connections here feel either too lose or forceful. I did like the visual feel of the Tokyo story and the use (or absence) of sound. The film does convey an authentic feel of the places and people, but the story no matter how dramatic is not engaging and I found great difficulty connecting with most of the characters. Yes, character development lacks big time in this film (perhaps a bit less for the Tokyo story). So, if you like Amores Perros, you're probably better off watching it again.

679,theopener80,We waited three years after 21 Grams for this?,4,19 March 2007,"You would expect more from the man who directed ""21 Grams,"" but unfortunately this movie proves that he's running on fumes at this point. The movie might have been revolutionary fifteen years ago before movies like Traffic, American Gun, 21 Grams, Happy Endings, etc, but here it just comes across as generic and formalistic. Extremely predictable is an understatement. Whereas 21 Grams had several characters connected by one event, this movie tries to stretch several people in different continents to tie into several multiple events that are interconnected. In addition, the characters continually act without any common sense at all, which makes them completely unrealistic. In addition, several plot twists come out of nowhere, but not in a good way. I don't want to give to much away, but the ""plot twists"" toward the end had no foreshadowing whatsoever and felt like they were tossed in there because the film-makers realized how horrible the script was (a strong likelihood).However, on the bright side of things... What an amazing cast! Especially considering what they had to work with script-wise. Every performance feels Oscar worthy, and not one person did a bad job (not even the child actors). The cinematography is quite beautiful, but suffers from the same fate that some movies of this caliber have, and that's the director has fallen in love with his footage. Several scenes repeated what we already knew and didn't add anything to the story as either a story or character driven scene. The score fits the movie pretty well, although I still scratch my head as to how it won an Oscar. Oh well.All in all, 21 Grams probably spoiled me quite a bit, and I might be overly harsh on this movie, but I know this director can do better if he ventured into new territory, rather than concentrating on turning his movies into ""Trilogies"" based on themes alone.

683,gdozanghi,"""Babel"" is a series of four plots intertwined with each other as they unravel in different parts of the world",6,21 April 2016,"First of all, let me start by saying that this is not a film a person enjoys. There are no aspects of it that are pleasant to watch. The themes that are treated are not pleasant aspects of life, but they are rather uncomfortable and sometimes disturbing. This is not the type of films I like to watch, but nonetheless I don't believe that it is a reasonable criteria by which one can discard a film as not worthy of being watched. About the director. I have viewed some other films directed by Inarritu and I think that above anything else, Inarritu values innovation. In ""Birdman"" he made a film which appears to have been shot in one long single take; in his most recent picture ""The Revenant"" he also makes use of long takes and on the whole it is not the typical film one would view at the cinema, for the unconventional storyline and the extreme extent to which DiCaprio brought his acting skills winning a well- deserved Oscar.In Babel, Inarritu attempts to bring innovation through the style of narration. He makes use of a non-linear narrative which had been so innovative when Tarantino had made use of it in ""Pulp Fiction"". In Babel too, we have separate story lines intertwining with each other. However, the links between the stories appear to be somewhat forced and there is not the same flow that can be felt in ""Pulp Fiction"". The reason for this, in my opinion, is that Inarritu has tried to transfer a narrative style, which had been extremely effective on a purely action scale, to a level of morality. I felt that Inarritu failed to succeed in his objective because the subdivision in four separate plots left no space for an in-depth psychological analysis of the characters, which, I believe is necessary to have some kind of moral depth and message to the story. This also had a negative effect on the rating of the actors. In fact, Cate Blanchett, who has always, gives a stunning performance is penalized by the fact due to the shortness of the episodes the viewer doesn't really get to know her and can't really feel strong empathy with her or even compassion although she is seemingly bleeding to death on screen.",Babel

Given enough critical acclaims these movies start to be overexposed and finally everyone starts believing there is more to them than just the latest stylish interpretation of a familiar subject. Well, Babel is that kind of movie - stylishly shot in interesting locations and with some great performances it deals with the the theme of miscommunication. It doesn't say anything new or anything interesting for that matter but it says it pretentiously and with some visually astounding techniques. After sitting through over 2 hours you will walk away with grief in your heart and feeling so emotionally disconnected with all the characters that the message of the movie will probably be lost. This doesn't mean that the actors didn't do their best to convey the grief, sadness and loneliness they were experiencing. It's just that the movie feels contrived at times and the story (actually stories) is too bleak and even boring at times to be memorable.

Being nominated for best picture is already unfair, considering other pictures left out, such as The Illusionist.A set of boring, weakly (ill?) connected stories trying to address the overall idea of communication across language and culture barriers. You can already guess the theme after looking at the title and the trailer or a couple of scenes. This movie is a cliché. The average viewer seems to feel inspired after connecting the stories with the ""Babel concept"", and then running to talk about what the slow paced and irrelevant scenes evoke in them. What surprises me more is how stigmatizing the movie is, coming from a Mexican director. He seems too acclimatized in the Hollywood egg-shell.Some bad acting; unbelievable characters and story lines. Garcia Bernal's worst performance. He doesn't even know how to fake this nanny's brute nephew character, in a lousy role that nobody can fix from a ridiculous script. His pretty-boy face and delicate manners can't be hidden with a simple mustache and inexplicable behavior. Gosh, the nanny actress got a nomination as supporting actress...

Babel is a nuanced telling of a series of mini-stories that portray the connectedness of events, the challenges of communication and the alienation of the human experience. The film is a triumph for its director - his knowledge of and sensitivity to widely disparate cultures and issues is remarkable. This is no superficial Hollywood film dumbed down for a mass market audience. This is a film that is sensitive without pulling punches, showing ordinary people facing life's pain and tragedy head-on.

Especially when you have no idea when the ambulance is coming and are spending hours waiting for it. If she died it would have been because Brad Pitt's character was slightly retarded when it comes to making a decision. The director and writer needed to further the plot so we could watch an old Morrocan woman give her water and opium. Then the audience can say look how nice Morrocans are she doesn't even know those white people and she's helping them. Why do plots in all of today's movies have to intertwine through strange coincidences. How many coincidences are too many? Maybe we should set a limit? No higher than 10? Current trend in film, young boys masturbating get used to it because this isn't the first or last time you'll see that on the big screen. In the Squid and the Whale, he wiped it some girl's locker.

There are some very good scenes in the movie, like the Discotheque in Shibuya (Tokyo) or the INS check post in Tijuana, but besides it is just an above average fair.

Please. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young sum up in a 3 minute song 'Teach Your Children Well' what takes Alejandro González Iñárritu two and a half bum-numbing hours.

694,magazineBF,How to tell three stories when you haven't got even a decent one.,2,2 February 2007,"Babel is a new film which aims to denounce old issues. Lack of understanding and communication are commonplace in our postmodern society. It may be praised by some because of the stand taken by its director. However, the only one who fails to convey any worthy message and make himself understood is Iñárritu. The Mexican is been losing fuel and power of communication since he finished ""Amores Perros"" (2000). Things that happen when you embrace Hollywood and leave behind your working class background.This is a highly unrecommended film for cinema lovers  particularly if you smoke. After the first ten minutes of footage, you realise that you don't care about what occurs to the characters. Then, a claustrophobic feeling commences to invade your body as you feel trapped in the cinema. Eventually, you start to chew your cigarettes and hope this guy follows the path of British actor James Fox and retires for the next ten years.The only story of the three worth exploring is the Japanese one. The other two are topical and typical; they have been recounted so many times that you cannot be bothered to enumerate them. However, the Japanese story has, to some extent, some potential. And what about the weak connexions between them. One must feel proud of oneself as linking two unrelated stories through an ""old hunt trip to Morocco"" - very clever indeed.If you want to look cool and show off in front of other people talking about society and language misunderstandings, why don't you - instead of stretching an inexistent engaging story for almost 150 minutes! - go to your local video store and rent Rossellini's ""Paisà"" (1946), for instance . Your friends won't beat you up for stealing more than two hours of their lives and, hopefully, you will learn something from one of the true masters of cinema.In conclusion, if you want to know how not to make a successfully three-stories-related film, spend your money in Babel. Otherwise, save it for some flowers for Valentine's day. It will help to improve your relationship with your loved one after some confusion and banal misunderstandings.",Babel

It is carefully thought out, sensitively crafted, and beautifully filmed, not to mention the very human, compassionate way the actors delivered their parts. Seldom am I moved by a film. We live in a very altered world, where people can live close together and never really connect. It is the age old artistic subject matter that a Roger Waters or any decent, socially oriented craftsman would welcome. Without going into specifics, please do yourself a favour and see this movie at least a couple of times. If it does not move you, I am afraid you have a heart like Pharaoh of old. I was particularly touched by the performance of the Japanese girl who, by the way, got robbed of an Oscar if you ask me. It was great to see the likes of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett cast in a movie peopled with unknown actors. I am sure they worked for less than their regular pay, but there are other rewards more precious than more money. These two got the rare opportunity to be part of something that is so hard to come by in the modern film industry, and that is nothing short of a work of art that in its many-leveled subtleties and without being complicated, in its simple way probes the depths of the human condition and of the human heart, as shared and connected experiences in a world of confusion and division. What an experience! Bravo to the the filmmaker. It is not possible to achieve something more important and beautiful than this kind of statement. I cannot say enough about it. Of particular note is the original musical score, without which, I think, the film would lose a great deal of its emotional and thematic weight. A truly amazing effort that makes me hope that the film industry can deliver like it once did. A+",Babel
696,S_ocks,"Gritty, Gripping, Great",8,4 January 2007,"The one thing that annoys me about some movies which tackle a controversial subject, such as racism or war, is the fact that scenes are often 'dulled down' to make them less confronting and shocking to an audience. Babel isn't extremely confronting, but it can make you cover your eyes in shock.Babel was quite similar to Crash, but tackled a different topic. Where Crash used colourful dialogue to show racism, Babel is jam packed full of creative scenes that focus on state laws, disability and war (especially terrorism). These scenes wouldn't have had the same effect if it wasn't for the superb filmwork and editing (the nightclub scene) and the fantastic acting (in the desert) by both young and old actors (Dakota Fanning's younger sister, Elle).At over two hours, Babel may seem a little long winded, but it sticks in your mind for weeks, and makes you think more about current world issues.

What a waste of time and talent."" If you are of the ""if everyone was nice to each other their would be world peace"" opinion you may like this movie. if you believe in reality you will not. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to the illegal alien that was working illegally as a nanny. I understood her pain, but illegal is illegal. She had 16 years to do something about her status. I'm sure that parents who hired her were aware of her status and equally guilty for what happened to her and their children. The only ones I felt sorry for were the children. Why the American parents went and left their children at a time when the family had lost a member is beyond me. Pretty selfish of them to figure the other children weren't affected by the death. The Morroccan parents were very remiss in not teaching gun safety to their kids. Actually this movie made me angry.

The nanny story I still comprehend now the Japanese girl's story really didn't give anything good to the movie. When I saw the connection between the girl's father and the rest of the story all I said was, is this it?!?!?! I believe that they could have done a much better story than it really is. The all theme about the international crisis was a good one and they really missed the whole point! Maybe it was my fault for going with truly great expectations, but when I left the movie I still had the feeling that the movie was still about to start and all I had seen was nothing more than an introduction!!!

Director should go and watch lat years Oscar winning movie crash to learn how to connect these kind of stories and how to run a common theme well.

The film looks at relationships, from husband/wife, parent/children,  brother/sister and plays around the themes of love in adversity. The  characters are all interlinked in a very random way, it's a little like  10 degrees of separation.  The film is set in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the US, and the director  makes full use of the different backdrops to bring the picture alive.  The characters are deep and insightful, each has a problem to face up  to and the subtle, naturalistic way their issues play out make for  truly emotional cinema. This is not a film about heroes, it's a film  about trying to make the right choices when your back is to the wall,  and the doubts that go with this.

There are four stories, one in Mexico/USA, Japan, and two in Morocco. Each one is very good on its own, specially the Japanese one, which is the most simple and beautiful. The problem is they are very vaguely connected, and get mixed in the editing with no apparent logic. The second story from morocco, the one w/ Pitt, is the one that lingers and just ruins the pace of the movie.

There are few frantic, ADD inducing edits, which usually rob a film of the power, the soulful power it would usually have. This was unsettling to the person I went with.

Crash-like or not, the film is not the first to tell a story of intertwined events, nor will it be the last. Discussions about screenplay similarity are irrelevant. What should be considered is the story being told by the very competent director, Alejandro González Iñárritu. It is a tale of different lives and the choices people make. Choices made in extreme situations and how their repercussions are interpreted and dealt with around the globe. It is also about how misconceptions and stereotypifications are unfair and misleading.

The first half hour or so was very engaging and made me want to watch the rest of the movie, however the more the story wound and dragged on the more I became acutely aware of being manipulated. Am I supposed to feel sorry for people who break laws and then actually have to face consequences regardless of race, sex or creed? Am I supposed to feel bad that I'm an American citizen and as such am automatically labeled a 'World Bully' by everyone else? To be completely honest this movie actually made me really mad that I watched it. Had it not been separated you could have made intriguing films about each individual story that would have seemed more interesting and would have worked a little better then trying to mesh all three stories into one. I think had they been separated you could have felt more of an isolated feel than you did jumping from one to another. This movie just simply bugs me and I can't shake it.",Babel

My biggest gripe is that this movie seemed to drone on and on for what seemed like an eternity with no real direction about what is actually going on. I understand the Babel metaphor that they are touching on but nothing about this movie really excites me in any way. There was so much fat that could have been trimmed to make room for things that the viewers were more interested in. The gun connects the Japanese business man to Hassan who is connected to the kids who shoot the bus. Great, why should we care? On top of that the movie dismisses the connection with a police officer wanting to discuss the matter downtown. That's it!!?? Why do we have to spend half an hour on the daughters sexual insecurities. Oh yeah, right, pantiless Japanese school girls on extacy are hot. Look, if I wanted to watch pron I'd just watch pron. Also, what happened to Santiago? Why would you spend most of the movie developing his character only to leave us with the maid who has a handful of lines? A previous poster compared this movie to Crash and said that this movie left us with more questions than answers. To the former I say, what are you smoking? Crash was in every way superior to this snooze fest. It kept you interested and it wrapped up nicely. It was far more visually appealing. The flow of Babel was frighteningly close to the meandering storytelling of a senile old man. Could this have been written by Grampa Simpson? I wouldn't be surprised.

If we do not make greater attempts in understanding each other, the world will continue to be filled with war, prejudice, and inhumanity. It is sad to see the number of posts that contain racist and prejudicial remarks about entire populations. Why should the nanny be forced to work through her son's wedding? This warm, wonderful woman cared deeply for those children; her status as an illegal immigrant led immigration officials to treat her brutally and put the children at greater risk. How come not one relative of the lovely white couple could be found to watch the children through this crisis? White Americans may have money, reside in the world's only superpower, but this does not prevent them from making poor choices. The US government was more interested in getting terrorism in the media than they were in any of the lives involved. The poor Morrocan families were treated brutally. Let's not forget how many American children play with guns and kill people (sometimes intentionally). This film is an honest reflection of how preoccupied Americans are at maintaining their apparent superiority. I am not sure this sense of superiority is warranted. America is engaged in a campaign of hate towards non-whites.

I've read a lot of comments saying they were disappointed about the film... and I surely understand them, but not because I think the movie sucks... I'll put it more clear; This director is trying to bring us another (alternative) version of cinema. You're NOT going to find in this movie what you see on others. The narrative cohesion that i've read is lacking...is in fact a space for people to think about what they are watching... Since Hollywood stereotype, we always tend to do the easiest... just sit and watch. Let the time pass, freak out a bit... a beer and go to bed. This movie wants YOU to think, take your own conclusions on what you see. The useful thing is the feeling you get as you put yourselves in the character's situations. You realize we're all living in wonderlands in our own ways. I can assure you that the more attention you pay to the film, the more you're going to take from it. have you seen how we are? when nothing new comes around we complain, and when someone tries something out, we complain as well saying is not understandable or it's crazy....Try ALWAYS not to get used to what you see... movies and art in general NEEDS to change... and this I think is the new cinema coming... let's not throw it to the trash can before it shows all it has to show.",Babel

Ther story unoriginal and far fetched, scenery was desert, desert (think Depche Mode video with out the pop music), and Tokyo. The four story lines were lame, the characters connections weak, and the ""Latin"" aspects of the film seems more like ""Im Latin and I need it in my film for me to relate to the story"" and the climax, or perhaps the lack of one.. well disappointing.. The tone of the whole film as a total downer.. from start to finish.. Not to mention the loopish timeline that gives away more than it gives and the sluggish pacing...The redeeming qualities? The acting was superb... top notch artists doing there art.. but then again.. the vehicle was totally rusted out.It was way too like Sryiana meets Lost in Translation.. but without Bill Murry and Scarlet Johanson... and I HATE films that remind me of other films..Kudos to the cast.... -10,000 style points to writers and directors..",Babel

It's a very simple, repeating tune (which a lot of the music in this film is), but it is very powerful.I *know* I've heard it before; this is driving me crazy.Anyways, I found the movie to be a little too slow. There were just so many shots which, while good cinematographically, did not reinforce the film. I walked out of the theatre yawning, even if pining over the undisclosed conclusions to the stories.Acting was fairly strong across all fronts, but I think Cate should have reacted more strongly to being *shot*. She seemed to handle that pretty lightly. I also don't understand why she resisted being sewn up; sure, it was established that she was a bit of a health freak with the ice cube thing, but she was going to *die* without stitches, and her maternal instinct of surviving for her children should have easily trumped the fear of infection or pain of the needle.",Babel

Because of this movie i'm looking forward to watch the next movie directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. I'm sure it will be a masterpiece.But what disappointed me was the rating this movie got.

Definitely one of, if not the best movies of the year. All thanks to the man behind the camera. Everything was perfectly timed, all though often times not sequential, as well as perfectly shot. Every shot in this movie dripped with power. The actors were phenomenal as well, some would say in large part due to Naruto. While there were stars like Pitt, Bernal, and Blanchet it didn't matter.

When do you ever see a movie where the main characters don't show up until about 20 minutes into the movie? I saw this at the Austin screening and had to leave before it was over because I just couldn't stand it anymore. The four stories each by themselves do not make any sense whatsoever. It wasn't until just before I left that they started to tie the third one into it, and that was almost an hour & a half in. Most of the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the story and some of that could have, no, should have been left out because they are vulgar and completely uncalled for, especially when they're just children. Don't get me started on the hairy monster. 90% of the movie is subtitled from Spanish, Chinese and Arabic(?). The only English is spoken by Pitt & Blanchett. The few scenes with those two are by far the best scenes in the movie, and they're not that good either. I hope most people are smart enough to not listen to the likes of Ebert and the NY Times.

It deserves no awards. Out of the group of 11 of us who went to see it 2 people enjoyed it.

The stories take place in Japan, California, and Morocco, three seemingly different places. Yet, people are people everywhere and they share feelings of love, anger, fear, and comfort. I really think this would be an educational film for people from about age 14 and up. However, the film does contain nudity and foul language.

Why is there extensive full frontal nudity of a 15 yr old girl who fails to seduce a man twice her age? Why did she lie about her mother's death?

739,CemYurtseven,Just Fate?,8,11 November 2006,"This is the third Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga movie I've seen. Previously, I had watched Amores Perros and 21 Grams which both pertain to these two men whose works I find complementary to one another. And, I think ""Babel"" is even better than those two impressive films. Those who has seen ""Amores Perros"" or ""21 Grams"" would probably fall in with my opinion that some characters in those films are interrelated and maybe these two men were trying to explain how fate intersects lives of random people time to time. But, I think they are trying to point out something else in their last film. If we recall ""Babel"", the starting point of the suffering of the interrelated characters is the rifle that was gifted to an indigenous Morroccan years ago. Later, this guy sells the gun to another indigenous Morroccan. Afterwards, all the lives of the characters become doleful. OK, in this point of view, the consequences can be explained by fate but something very significant is avoided if you believe in this view. That is, each character determines his/her fate in one way. For instance, if the ignorant Moroccan father did not let his children use the rifle to hunt jackals the American woman would not have been wounded during her bus trip. He lost one of his kids and the other one was arrested. Is this just the fate or thick skinned behaviour? Or, let's take the Mexican maid. She is a well intentioned woman and devoted to the two kids she is looking after. But, she would not have troubled those kids and been deported to Mexico if she did not bring them to her son's wedding although someone else was found by their father, Richard (Brad Pitt) to look after the kids. I mean Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga not only seek pointing out coincidences and inevitable fate anyone might encounter but also state people somehow determine their fate by their wrong decisions taken in the past. Lastly, maybe one of the commonality of the three films I mentioned above is the sharp doleful scenes. Especially, while watching ""Babel"" I really felt sad deep inside during some scenes. The deaf girl's dancing in the disco without feeling the rhythm of the music unlike other Japanese youth might sound slightly sad. But, while watching that scene you automatically create empathy, see the world through her eyes- everyone frolic in silence- It is very sad but worth watching.",Babel
740,sethneel,what has become of the art of story telling?,1,11 November 2006,"as you have probably gathered, babel is a film composed of three different plot lines which are supposed to interrelate and illuminate each other in meaningful ways. it is the only movie that i have ever walked out of. after sitting through two hours of the tragedies afflicting each group of characters and a number of perplexing attempts at epiphany (pitt's character shows his Moroccan host pictures of his children and, oh my god, those are the children from the other story, the camera looks at the pictures on the wall of the apartment in tokyo and, oh my god, that is the same picture of the Japanese hunter and the Moroccan to whom the rifle that is used to cap pitt's wife was given (were we supposed to be surprised by these revelations of which the audience is clearly aware?)) i simply could not take it anymore. i feel like directors these days are so caught up in the art of separate yet interconnected and chronologically muddled narrative that often they fail to see the forest for the trees. and i can't understand all the babble proclaiming this movie as a candidate for film of the year. yes, it deals with hot button issues that pull at our collective heart strings and yes it could have been an interesting and thought provoking movie. however, in order to create a compelling story, a film must have compelling, carefully developed characters with complex motives, and babel certainly does not. the characters are simply walking talking victims of their circumstances, void of any qualities that would establish humanity or credibility. like i said, i sat through two hours, at which point the Mexican nannie is lost in the desert just north of the border with pitt's children. she leaves them alone to go and find help, gets picked up by the border patrol and frantically exclaims something like 'we have to find them or they will die!' it was then that i got up turned around and said, for all i care, the can all f ing die, and left the theater. in order for an audience to care about a cast of characters, they must know as much as possible about who they are and what it is that makes them behave in the ways that they do. instead, babel relies on us to flesh these things out with our stereotypes. it's time to get back to the basics of good storytelling. this won't happen until we are intelligent enough to demand better films and refuse to settle for babble.",Babel

The story jumped around from characters and scenes that made no sense. The story should have stayed in Morrocco instead of jumping back and forth to Mexico and japan. Too much time was spent on scenes that were BORING. Who cares about the story line about the poor Japanese deaf girls. I didn't need to waste my time watching how these deaf girls visualize their time at a Japanese club scene and promote their teenage sexuality. Totally useless.

But please see this film to understand more than you do today about the planet we inhabit with its myriad relationships and connections that we don't dream exist until we live them. I encourage one and all to see this film and leave your usual cinematic expectations at home. See it with fresh eyes--or as was said in an another film, abre los ojos (open your eyes).

But at least film viewers can get some kind of opportunity to see how others see us. Its not overly flattering. But we could learn from it. I'll leave with this: it's not a perfect film.

744,Drakesta827,Babel review.,10,14 November 2006,"I've always respected Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga since I saw Amores Perros. I can see how many might compare Babel with Crash but it, most definitely, has far greater substance. The directors made sure this film had more natural and realistic scenes without melodramatic story lines which would never happen(like in Crash). The most intriguing aspect of the film are the vivid snapshots of life in these countries. The scene in Tijuana at the wedding, the border crossing, the Japanese rave, to Cate Blanchetts uneasiness in Morrocco. Considering I live in San Diego and have been over the border quite a few times, I can assure you that Inarritu snapped a scene that paralleled many of my own experiences. When I asked my husband what his interpretation of the film was, he replied, ""there is no interpretation, he is just a good storyteller"", which of course, made me laugh because as a film aficionado, I couldn't help but dissect Babel. Although, he has a good point, what made his movies so intriguing is his storytelling and many other film makers such as Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Spielberg. Each time I see his films, I feel as if he's trying to show injustice in society or just illustrate human nature. After reading about the story of Babel, the idea Inarrritu and Arriaga tried to come across became clear. The tower of Babel was built by a united humanity to reach the heavens yet when they defied god by making a name for themselves instead of becoming a community, he ceased their ability to build by confusing languages so they couldn't communicate any longer. In the movie, we find a Japanese deaf teenage girl who is born with a difficulty to communicate, a couple who can't communicate to the police in Morrocco, and a Mexican woman who can't fight her case against the cops at the border. The part of the film that puzzled me is the connection of the Japanese father and his gun. Later on, I came to the conclusion that part of film took place in Japan to exemplify the most advanced world. Arriaga created a character from this society who went over to Morrocco, a less developed region, and gave a weapon to a Shepard who probably would have had a difficult time finding it in the first place and was ignorant of its dangerous repercussions. As we see, when the father lets his children use the gun independently to kill coyotes. The one aspect of the film that felt a little too coincidental, is the fact that Brad Pitt's children's lives are also in danger at the same time. Overall, this film paints a vivid picture of the static world we live in. Everyone should see it.",Babel

Expecting everyone to do as you ask with no concern for their culture. I saw this movie in Mexico with Spanish subtitles. Can wait to rent & change the settings to English to see that point of view. In the movie the subtitle for the man driving out of Mexico said he was the ""hijo"" which means son. I now understand that he was her nephew. Big difference!

The last scene when the father walks onto the balcony and sees his daughter standing by the glass railing. His reaction to her nudity is not one of surprise.

Children crossing the border with the nanny..Nanny is illegal .....Illegal immigration issues... wife shot.... in the most remote area of Morocco... a primitive land outside the capital and major cities ...simple life of the nomad... the police brutality against the old man .GOVERMENT BRUTALITY .. father running to protect his most valuable assets his Sons.. and above all the media that never fails to over indulge itself by HYPE .....I might be wrong with my assessment but I think the director was trying to surface these points as well as other expressed by this board... At the end of the day... Human emotions prevail regardless of what language you speak...",Babel

Yes, the movie was visually appealing and included some fine performances, but aside from these few strengths, it was a disorganized, melodramatic mess.I wish I could have back the few tedious hours of life that my wife and I spent being strung along with this overly drawn out series of bad decisions.

I really wish we hadn't! The multiple plot lines & the inter-connections are easily determined within the first 1/3 - 1/2 of the movie. However, the entire thing is nearly 2 1/2 hours long. So the viewer is left sitting there simply waiting for the movie to end, gaining no new information or revelations (an in my opinion, not even being entertained).Furthermore, if you got sick at the Blair Witch Project due to the camera techniques, DO NOT go see this movie! Between chasing the Moroccan boys through the desert & following Chieko through her outings with friends, the camera work had me incredibly sick.",Babel

How the stories are intertwined and played out suggests a great mind behind the scenes. Like 21 grams, the links are coincidental but then live sometimes is a series of coincidences. The acting of all involved is so natural and unforced it could only be done by the best of the best.

Only a depressed manic with the most disgusting sexual fetishes can have created this clutter of garbage. The pathetic sexual references in the movies have no connection with the central theme of the movie. Despite this the director has made a forceful attempt to inject his sexual fetishes in every scene.Finally, the movie has no bottom line, no central thread to hold it together.

This movie is one of the best examples of this in recent years. I was wondering as I exited the theater whether the theme of the movie was that since it was so pointless, that maybe that was the point. I also wonder if this director made this movie to impress his other director friends. Either way, it was terrible. The moral of the film? Guns are bad, really? That's a revelation. How about, bad things happen to good people, wow, amazing news. Or, and this one would prove it to be the smug crap it is, that a bad decision can come back to haunt you.

756,natecom-1,Do Not See This Movie,1,25 November 2006,"Clearly this film was trying to be ""Crash"". But it wasn't. ""Crash"" was a remarkable movie about a large group of interconnected characters. ""Babel"" is about five different badly made movies loosely tied together by throwaway lines. The writer's idea of Drama seems to be throwing in as many bad things as can possibly happen to a group of characters. If the film's intention was to show the damage that can come from miscommunication, then this would have made at least some sense. But that effect is ruined by implausible happy (or at least somewhat happy) endings. It was as if almost at the end of the movie the writer suddenly decided he had been too hard on these characters and it was time for something good to happen to them. Another thing that made this movie incredibly confusing and difficult to understand was the sense of time. Scenes were not presented in anything approaching chronological order. In fact, the five different submovies were spliced together pretty much at random, leaving the audience frequently wondering what the hell was going on. This was compounded by questionable lighting and sound decisions on the part of the director, such as the random 20 minute Japanese nightclub scene filmed in strobe with no sound. In fact, the entire Japanese submovie made my head hurt. For the first half an hour or so, or about the first scene with each of the tangentially connected groups of characters, I found this movie engaging. For the remaining hour and fifty minutes, I was either glancing at my watch wondering how long it was going to be before the movie was going to be over or trying not to laugh at the writer's attempts at deep meaningful dialogue. One striking example of this was Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's heartfelt kiss - while she was peeing. Apparently, this was supposed to have some profound effect on me as the viewer. It didn't.",Babel
757,ozandogan1,Tower's of Babel,10,21 December 2006,"One of the most beautiful thing about the movie was that Inarrutu filming objects differently, usually camera focus on a specific part of the object (human, car etc.) than overall it refocuses again, I think it is like human viewing we do not see the objects like classic camera view first we focus on a specific part of it. I found this type of view more realistic and it helps me to get in the movie much faster.Put a side technical success of the movie babel make me remember We live in the different parts of the world with speaking different languages, first it was only language separate us from each other, but we find a way to talk, but poison of bias separate us from each other. We convicted to aloneness.Inarrutu communicate us in this manner. Booming rifle is not the thing that hit us, it is not language either, it is the cold wall of our lack of communication, our bias, paranoia, they can left us alone in the middle of the desert, or in the crowded street in japan.In a hygienic tour a catastrophic accident make our relatives enemy, our enemies our friends.thank you Babel",Babel
758,mxo42-1,Well woven tapestry of our world of woeful mis-communication,8,26 November 2006,"Babel is indeed a spiritual movie, filled with opportunities to prove that the 'road to Hell is paved with good intentions.' While the viewer will have trouble at first meshing the sub-plots into coherence, one has to believe that the initial incomprehension is intentionally engendered, permitting a growing smile of understanding, accompanying a grimace of horror at all that can go wrong without any malicious intent. The ending could be upbeat or down, and it is a credit to the creators that they did not cheapen the finale with any exceedingly sanguine or cynical coda. It is increasingly hard to produce a movie that is 'different,' but this does qualify as a lyrical tone poem and parable, justifying its length and biblical reference.",Babel

For Amelia, it is conflict, to be or not to be, either to attend her son's wedding or not, either to stay with the children who she looks after or not , but when she decided to accompany the children and to attend her son's wedding, it appeared a pretty choice, but misfortune soon ruins all her life.",Babel

It seems that the audience is dragged through three different colored ponds of reeking sewerage (who needs to be constantly reminded that not all the world is a bed of roses) Multiple (3)different plots confused the audience in the first half of the movie. Anti-gun theme brings up old argument: Is the gun at fault or is the person(s) who own it responsible? God of War was a much better anti-gun theme.Did not do the Border Patrol or Immigration any favors and caste them in the light of a villain.Still trying to figure out the relevance of a deaf Japanese girl to the whole storyline.

I felt a connection with the characters in Jones's movie, including the 'bad guys' that I never got with Babel, despite the latter movie's all-star cast. 'Three Burials' had a certain ""tension"" that kept me engrossed in the movie, while I often found myself checking my watch during Babel.

The director paid such great attention to these small details, so I am sure its no goof. As for the shot, I also thought that there was a problem with that, but there was a point when the road turned slightly to the right and this was the very time the bullet hit. Perhaps I am just justifying, but there would have been no reason why the director would not have placed Susan (Blanchett) on the right side of the bus instead of the right. The only reason would be to make the shattering of the bus' window not visible from the vantage point of the children. Anyway, great movie.",Babel

One end of a conversation early, the other end later in the film.They were crabs, not snapping turtles.Y tu mama' tambien shows upper-class, prosperous-looking Mexicans. I think affluent, and therefore well-cared for, people look ""more beautiful"" than those living in poverty, who aren't able to look after their health, regardless of ethnicity. The former are healthy; the latter are less so, and this affects our perception of looks.This is an interesting group, though some are prone to be rather irritable. I like it here. John",Babel
768,vgp_3,A unique experience.,9,17 December 2006,"Babel isn't a movie for everyone, and that's part of what I love about it. Unlike movies such as this year's The Departed, whose subject matter and style could not have more mass appeal, Babel is long, non-linear, and aggressive. This is the kind of movie that incites strong responses; long discussions about events, themes, and characters, arguments, disagreements etc. I have been waiting for a movie like this for a long time. I want to recognize Babel for rousing me (be it aggressively) from my cinematic slumber. That alone makes all of its weaknesses feel trivial.Babel is best appreciated when one does not anticipate any sort of ""lesson"" or ""message"" from the director. The movie is in some ways like a documentary, thanks to its stark realism, but it fundamentally remains suspenseful fiction, with a beginning, a climax, and an end. Babel, as I interpret it, is about several people set in diverse contexts who are forced to rely on their closest (but challenged) relationships, to find strength in the midst of extremely conflict-ridden and traumatic situations. Babel impressed me because it effectively created such relevant conflict without involving any villains, leaving only chaos fueled by alienation. I did not feel depressed or drained as I exited the theater; instead I felt humbled. I felt a unique sense of passivity as people pushed and shoved out of the theater, shouted across the hall, blocked the doorway, blew cigarette smoke all over the place, and made me miss the advance green as I exited the parking lot.To those who find movies like this appealing, I strongly recommend Babel.",Babel

771,homebrew-1,Pretentious And Too Long,5,23 December 2006,"The title ""Babel"" suggests that this is a movie where everybody is tragically disconnected by a language barrier (or some such) so that if we could all communicate it would be a great world after all. In fact, there is nothing like that at all in the movie.The plot with Brad Pitt in Morroco hinges upon the idea that these two kids are shooting a high-powered rifle at a bus. They hit a tourist, and it's hard to find a doctor because of poor communication. But this has nothing to do with lack of communication. Rather, these are just bad kids, and, although the fate of these kids and their family that unfolds is sad, it is really hard to feel much sympathy for them. Anybody anywhere could end up injured and removed from medical assistance, and, after all, Pitt simply makes a stupid decision not to tell the bus driver to drive like Hell to town.The idea with the deaf-mute in Japan is that she is acting out because of the death of her mother. If she were alone in this, it would be one thing. But all her friends act the same way, so it seems that rather than acting out she is simply a bad kid who runs in a bad crowd. Moreover, there really isn't any connection at all between her story and the other stories. The cleverness is supposed to be that she can't communicate because she is a deaf-mute, but she has been that way all her life and seems to be surrounded by an ample support group, and lives in an expensive penthouse.The story with the Mexicans also has nothing to do with a lack of communication. It's pretty stupid, when you are an illegal immigrant, to be crossing the border back and forth with a drunk driver, and without proper paperwork. The maid is, after all, an illegal immigrant. The family will simply hire somebody else, and she isn't so bad off in that her son has just gotten married, they all look pretty prosperous (or at least well fed), and she will soon be a grandmother. Not bad, actually.In general, this movie goes on much too long. The scenes in Japan with the girl wandering around are particularly boring, but the wedding scene in Mexico is also much too long, as are the scenes in Morroco with the wife dying.The movie is unbelievable in the sense that with a bullet wound in the chest, it is unlikely she would have lived very long. She would have been dead in an hour, tops. And, of course, you have the obligate scenes where everybody is smoking.My main problem with this movie is that I didn't like the characters. In ""Crash,"" you get to like them all. The cop who at first seems to be a racist shows another side, etc. Here, you have a group of people it is hard to feel sorry for. (Well, that's not entirely true for the American tourists, since she did not deserve to get shot. But there is very little development of any story about this couple beyond the few facts we learn while they eat lunch.)Once ""Crash"" won an Oscar (deservedly), the race was apparently on to copycat the formula. We now see this overblown epic, and ""Bobby"" basically has the same type of plot that follows a number of interlinked people. It will be nice when this blows over and we can get back to some movies with a coherent plot about a single group of people.",Babel
772,rvb1977,"Kept asking, when would this get better...or finally end?",3,21 April 2007,"I had fairly low expectations heading into my viewing of Babel, since it hadn't been rated highly on Blockbuster's online site, despite being rated 7.7 here on IMDb.With that in mind, Babel struggled to even come close to my severely lowered expectations.The movie does not develop characters, so you are left essentially emotionless towards them. You don't care what happens to them at all, actually.With that in mind I am left to believe that the attempt that Babel makes is to try to get us to think. Think about the world. Think about people. Etcetera, etcetera. Babel had potential to do this. It could have opened up our eyes to the world, to the media, to economic differences (American prosperity versus the rest of the world), and maybe some other things, too.But, it fails. The only real point that Babel gets across is the notion that people, at their core, are similar no matter their location, race, language, culture, etc. But hey, many of us already knew this.

773,tiibimmer,did the phone between Brad Pitt and the Nanny change the second time we see it?,9,26 December 2006,"I've been scouring the internet, but can't find a single person who saw what I saw during Babel. I could swear that the conversation between Brad Pitt and the Nanny is different the second time we see it in the movie. The first time we see it, it's from the Nanny side of the phone and we hear Brad Pitt's voice. He's very stern and inflexible as he demands that the Nanny stay with his kids and miss her son's wedding in Mexico. After she pleads with him and finally gives up, she hands the phone to Brad's son and they discuss his day at school. The second time we see it, it's from Brad's side of the phone and he's in the hospital. He's just heard great news that Cate is going to be okay, so his demeanor is much more amiable. This time, he tells the Nanny he'll find someone else to watch the kids while she goes to her son's wedding. He then has the exact same conversation with his son about his day at school. So we know it's the same conversation. Except the second time, he's letting the Nanny go to Mexico. If I'm correct in what I saw, then this 'reverse twist', in which the Nanny never will get deported and what we saw will never really happen, elevates this movie to greater heights. It's the director and writer's mechanism to further establish the good and bad that may occur between differing cultures when communication breaks down. Please, will someone confirm that what I saw was correct. And if so, please consider the message that this 'reverse plot twist' delivers and how it elevates this movie to greater heights.

I've personally never been to Mexico, but I'd love to)The movie was painfully slow, and after the first 20 minutes, I got the point.

777,Whedonesque,A Summary so that you don't have to see it. Spoilers!!!!!,1,21 February 2007,"OK, so if it isn't obvious from watching this film that it is a crash/ traffic wanna-be then let me explain. This film is very poorly tied together. You couldn't care less about the characters or what they have in common. There are four basic parts to this film. 1.Two small Moroccan Boys who live with their parents and sister. One of the boys masturbates while thinking about his sister.(Probably the most interesting scene in the film) They get a gun to hunt and because they are stupid, shoot at a bus. 2. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, for reasons unknown, are in Morocco. Cate Blanchett is shot by the masturbating boy and is injured. Brad Pitt can't get help because the government thinks that terrorists are involved. Cate Blanchett has to pee so Brad Pitt puts a pan under her and then they make out while she urinates. 3. The man who gave the gun to the guy who sold the gun to the guy who gave the gun to his masturbating son to shoot jackals, has a daughter who is deaf. She also like to get naked and sexually harass men. She flashes her crotch at the camera, makes out with a dentist, takes some ecstasy and forces a cop to fondle her. 4.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett have a son and a daughter, they are being baby sat. Some Mexican women wants to go to her son's wedding so she brings them over the border to Mexico. They have a great time, a chicken's head is ripped off, and she makes out with some man in with a mustache for no reason. Then they can't get back over the border cause it appears that the kids are kidnapped and the guy who is driving is drunk. Seemed like a good reason to me. This is the ENTIRE film...Anyone ho has seen this film will be hard pressed to add anything to my description. It is all above. If you think that this film should win the Oscar for Best Picture then that is fine by me, but rest assured there are far better films out there and if this film can be nominated and even win then i want to see more and more off beat films up for nominations. By the way Pan's Laybrinth should have had a Best Picture Nomination. Anyway I hope the Departed wins because Babel is just lame.",Babel
778,aliaga53,"A worse version of ""Crash""",4,24 January 2007,"Babel is one confusing and pretentious movie. I don't mind the non-linear plot if the viewers are made aware of the shift in the temporal relationship of the film. Simplicity is pure beauty in any form of art including films; and simplicity is what ""Babel"" lacks. Literature uses non-linear plots to tell a story; example is Kurt Vonnegut's ""Slaughterhouse Five"" but the readers of the story are not left hanging with too many questions. If confusion is a form of art, then Babel succeeds in this regard. To effectively convey the story and its message, whether in a movie, essay or other forms of literature, the author should not leave the viewers or readers with disconcerting questions. I can see the essential connection between Morocco and Mexico scenes; but the Japan scene was seemingly out of place, and kind of dragging too. Save for the fact that gun was previously owned by the Japanese father, I don't see any other vital connection with Morocco and Mexican stories. If the tourist wife were so prejudiced against the Moroccan culture, why did she go there in the first place, leaving her children in the care of the Mexican nanny? If the Moroccan tourist bureau could afford air-conditioned coach to transport tourists, it might as well was able to provide help (e.g. ambulance) in case of emergencies such as the accidental shooting of the American woman. The phone conversation between Pitt and the Mexican nanny gave me an impression that she had been able to return to California after the problem with the US border officers. Thank God, I'm not alone thinking that way. What use is finding the former owner of the gun, which the Japanese police was trying to do, in solving the case of the supposed ""terrorist"" act? Could there have been an incestuous relationship between the Japanese father and his daughter? That could have been a possible pretext for the Japanese mother's suicide. It is so ""un-Japanese"" or ""un-Asian"" for the father and the completely naked daughter to hold hands in the open at the end of the movie. ""Babel"" is a worse version of ""Crash"". I give the movie (director) four stars for the effort, and nine stars for Mr. Pitt for superb acting.",Babel
779,husseincan,A wider crash-like movie,10,18 February 2007,"When I saw Babel I remembered Crash. Yes, we are related to each other and Babel wanted to emphasize this. The message given to people by Babel is that whatever we do we are related to each other in a way or another. The making of the film was excellent especially the stories in Morocco, Japan and Mexico. The film didn't touch a social problem only but also it shed lights on an important fact in our life: the unfair judgment and baseless generalization we make about people. We need to talk , not to judge. I think the movie is very nice and has tackled such issues tellingly. The movements from one scene to another has a symbolic significance here because it shows that our world is really small and whatever we do will have its positive or negative effects on us. The actors in Morocco story were very good. Yousif, the little boy who shot the American tourist did his role nicely and naively but efficiently. His brother Ahmed, was more responsible than hot-tempered Yousif. Their father was a mazing in his acting. I speak Arabic but I wasn't able to understand what they were saying completely because they spoke Morrocan dialectal Arabic. The subtitles were of great help to me. The story in Japan was efficiently done. The deaf girl was excellent in her acting and her father was no less than her. Japan is completely different from Morroco in all aspects but the film shows us how similar we are: Our relatively similar problems. Everybody is inflicted with something and the sarcastic thing here is that we are connected in many ways.",Babel

I wondered if she confessed she lied about seeing her mother jump off the balcony. Obviously she was distraught when she wrote it, and the investigator, upon reading it later had a look of sadness on his face. This is driving me nuts, did i miss something, or is it left for the audience to ponder? I have always considered Japanese culture somewhat strange, foreign and unlike any other, this movie portrays that quite well, yet there is a thread between all teenagers as the movie shows quite eloquently",Babel

It has nothing new , it's predictable , it reminds me of Crash , but with nothing genuine from it. I am very disappoint about this one , because movie like this one is nominalized on Oscar , and movies like Hard Crash , or The Prestige , or why not Rocky 6 , will not get any of this famous awards. I hope we are not in that moment to think that , if you win a Oscar , is okay for me to copy your script and take one too the next year. It's a shame , it's an offense directly pointed to crash. I'm sorry , this is my opinion. Don't waste your time watching this movie , if you didn't see Crash until now.

The story follows four different groups of people or stories and doesn't pay enough attention to any of them for you to really care about them. The incident in Morroco doesn't really set off an 'international incident' as the trailer boasts. I had visions of American forces blowing up the Middle East because ONE of their citizens was shot but all this film does is show some stories in two other countries - one currently related to the incident and one that has some vague connection from years ago. All pretty weak if you ask me. Cate Blanchett is apparently up for an award for this film; I can't understand why as she doesn't say more than a dozen lines. Brad Pitt's character is hilarious; they're in the middle of the Morrocan desert and he screams for someone to call an ambulance! Give this one a miss.",Babel

Coming out into the daylight after watching it felt odd, it seemed harsh that we could carelessly carry on with our lives after seeing these lives fractured beyond repair.

786,ubhproductions,Babel Zero: all the caffeine without the sugar!,1,21 January 2007,"Anyone watched that new movie Babel that's currently doing the rounds?I heard a few comments from friends who had seen it and (more foolishly) read a few reviews of it as well.To be honest, my interest was piqued from the snippets I'd heard. I was almost convinced I was finally gonna be seeing a Hollywood movie with a story someone over the mental age of 5 wouldn't get bored with (if you feel me).About 10 minutes into it, I started getting that nasty crawling feeling, scratching all over the back of my neck... the one that says ""aw, man, you been taken AGAIN!"".And about 15 minutes into it, I found that that feeling was indeed not without foundation.For those who want to see Babel (and I seriously pity those who think they're in for something interesting), don't read any further.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!Babel is (in all seriousness) 2 things in essence.Firstly, it's an approximately 3 hour long advertisement for the Coca Cola company (who obviously felt the need to hide under their 2nd largest yet slightly less obvious label, Sprite). Seriously. Make it a drinking game and count the bottles throughout the movie... you'll get loaded.Secondly it's a preachy piece of bulls**t about how guns hurt people.BIG BIG lesson there from the Yanks to the rest of the world (well, the Mexicans, Moroccans and Japanese as suggested in the film).The ""irony"" (for want of a better word) is that in this steaming splat of faeces, it is the Americans who fall victim to the irresponsible use of firearms by Japanese people (well, one in particular), Morrocans (a couple of them, adults and children alike) and the Mexicans (who admittedly don't actually KILL anyone with their guns, they just scare little Aryan American children with them while they celebrate weddings).To me, it was The 3 Amigos all over again. Americans using popular culture to validate their foreign policy and to blame the rest of the world for their savagery.The ""hype"" behind this movie is that it's supposed to show the effect had on mankind after God was so kind to punish us with language (well, OK, multiple languages) for being so bold as to build a tower to reach Heaven. Confusion, anger, bad times, etc... a lack of understanding.It seemed to me that the only thing reaching higher than he could/should reach was the director. He made his point about 5 minutes into the damn film. If he was indeed an artist with any real talent, he could have made his point in 30 seconds AND sold his soul to advertising Coke at the same time.I mean why dress up something into what it plainly isn't? It's sorta like The 6th Sense (dont get me started on the ""Sham"") - it woulda made a great Twilight Zone episode... it made a (expletive deleted) awful piece of drivel as a ""movie"".I guess 2007 is just gonna be another year where I choke on my bile and force the few people around me to suffer my indignation.Ah well, why not. :P Like anything else has changed.Go watch Pan's Labyrinth instead!!!! It's an actual ""movie"", not a paid endorsement (del Toro proved he has a soul with that one).Happy 2007 everyone!",Babel

I understand that the director wanted to make us feel what it was like but it is really exaggerated, it is much too long, you think it will never end! and there is also that guitar tune at the end which is really unbearable!

789,keith-690,One of the worst movies of the year,1,24 January 2007,"Babel 4 countries, 2 rich, 2 poor. Asian, Latin, Western, Middle Eastern. 4 languages. Japanese guy brings rifle to Morocco, which is sold to a shepherd. One of the Shepherd's sons shoots an American woman riding in a bus, who improbably survives. The Mexican housekeeper of the injured American woman needs to go to her son's wedding in Mexico, and chooses to take the American woman's two children without permission over the border to Mexico. Upon returning to the US, she and her drunk relative are to be detained while coming back into the US. They speed off into the desert, the children and housekeeper are abandoned in the desert, are improbably found, and the housekeeper is deported back to Mexico. Japanese guy has issues with his deaf daughter. The plot is forced and extremely unlikely.There have been many Hollywood films that are critical of Latin America, many of them outright stupid and incorrect like Mr. and Mrs. Smith in a mythical Bogota that is hot. I suppose it is only fair to have films that are critical of America and Americans as this one is. The poor societies in the film are portrayed as being compassionate and giving, and the rich societies in the film are portrayed as being arrogant and unappreciative. The director is from Mexico, so Mexico is portrayed in a rather kind light. Mexico is easily the most dangerous of the four countries portrayed. The American border guards behave the way they do because of the outrageous illegal immigration from Mexico, not because they are naturally evil. The movie might have some merit if it was actually trying to tell four stories rather than four montages.Half star for naked Japanese chick.",Babel

Crash was an intertwined movie but was a very easy concept. Magnolia was intertwined but the concept did not work.

The movie doesn't copy the racism theme of ""Crash"", it's plot is not based on that, but on dealing with problems on different parts of the world. Different cultures, different ways of dealing with problems. The name is very suggestive: although we are in the 21-st century, the world is still an ancient Babel when it comes to solving problems.

The writer strikes me as arrogant to assume so much negativity and human failure to be human-and then writes a two hour script on it! The positives of the movie are the quality of acting, great scenery and some issues that have been touched upon: owning a gun especially in a household with two young boys and how western individualism encourages one to be selfish and not thing of the wellbeing of the ""group"". I have only rarely been tempted to leave the movie and this was one of those times but a friend insisted we see it through to the end.

795,christos-reveliotis,a highly critical view of a highly praised film,4,30 January 2007,"Disappointment is the first word that comes to mind, just stepping out of the cinema after having watched BABEL for 142min. Most probably because the film was hyped and praised so much. But I did not see anything like what the critics I read were saying.The film for me is nothing else but the portrait of a psychotic fear, bordering neurosis. I would hate to think or repeat the cliché that this is an American thing (the fear in the psychology of the average American and his view of the world, of which plenty of books and articles have been written about) but this film is so full of it, that it risks becoming a point of reference and the epitome of the phenomenon. In this empty and void of meaning film, the heroes are an average American family, the couple in crisis as usual, in a far away land, were everyone oscillates between stupidity, ignorance, irresponsibility and evil, all of which results in putting the lives of the American family in constant danger. Stereotypes abound: the uneducated, poor, stupid Arabs and their kids, who shoot at the bus for fun (no matter that the world famous incidents of kid-shooting sprees so far are only in the US schools), the totalitarian foreign policemen, the stupid drinking Mexican, the good-hearted, good-meaning but nonetheless also stupid Mexican illegal immigrant housemaid. As for the Japanese, they are nihilistic lost souls, living in a void world were the adults commit suicide and the kids are living their adolescence in the triangle of horror, drugs and sex deprivation. OH, PLEASE!!!! If this is not neurotic and fear psychosis, then I do not know what is. This family must have been cursed or all the evil eye of the world has befallen upon it! I think the director's dedication and wording ate the end of the film speaks volumes regarding all the above and the fear the world apparently creates in him.But why should this be relevant to the rest of us, not to mention ""marvelous"" etc. etc. that the film critics around the world have been trumpeting? It would have been marvelous if it was positioned as a movie that captures the fear psychosis that -as per the cliché I mentioned before- exists in the collective American subconscious, for that it does well (by the way the American friends I know somehow do not suffer from it, but granted, they do live and have lived outside the USA for many years). But as a discourse on the global village and the subsequent communication issues it creates, sorry, it does not even make it to the 6th grade of the preliminary school. Kids that age have more involving and interesting things to say on the subject than this movie.And this is the problem of todays cinema making: we have been so much bored with Hollywood rubbish, and we are so desperate for something good, that anything that is different is most often mistaken for the real thing! I have rated it as 4, only on the basis of technical aspects of directorship and filmography, which I did enjoy. But as a story and essence, I would say it was completely of the mark, 0.",Babel

At the beginning of the movie we sense a friction in the marriage of the two leading characters (Pitt & Blanchett) but we don't know the reason as to why Richard is accused, by his wife Susan, of neglecting his children.

Honestly, we kept waiting for Kevin Bacon to show up to provide the appropriate degrees of separation and tie this story together.We have yet to talk to anyone who really got this movie.

799,kuyeekee,Not everyone's cup of tea,7,4 February 2007,"I went to watch this movie with my ex flatmate and she left me to finish the movie alone, as she finds the rhythm too slow for her. Well, I love the movie - for this movie explores various depth in human emotions toward relationships.In Morocco, a couple who find themselves rather distant and are binded by 2 kids, re kind their relationship in a near death tragic event. Nothing mushy, just the level of intimacy and trust when an accident which was out of hand happened to them. This disaster might just be a blessing in disguise for them.Their children's caretaker, secretly brought their kids to her home in Mexico to attend her son's wedding - only to depart with them after an ignorant nephew abandoned them in the American-Mexican border. She cared for them since birth and an abrupt cut away from seeing them at the police station - left her in agony. However, her loving son came to pick her up and maybe it is time for her to be home where her heart belongs.Another story is about the native Moroccan which bought a rifle to kill the foxes that was trying to attack his goats. His two sons were held responsible for it - and the younger one, being the naughtier and a better shooter, tested out the rifle on a tourist bus from a distance. That shot hit the couple mentioned earlier. They tried to run away, when the police came for them, but the youngest boy gave himself up when the police shot his brother. One thing which moved me, was seeing their mother sitting in the police's van who didn't shed a single tear... Is this called tough love? She lead the police to them... while her hubby was trying to take them away from the scene... Is this the highest level of maternal love? Another story which linked all, was the previous owner of the rifle, who gave it to his tourist guide as a gift before he left Morocco. He lost his wife because she committed suicide with a shot in her own head. His teenage daughter harboured confusion and angst whilst growing up without a mother. She is a tomboy - but was exploring her sexuality then... She lied about her mother's death to a policeman, while trying to seduce him by stripping naked in front of him. The police man was very gentleman and left her with dignity. Being a true gentleman, he never utter a single word to anyone, though he found out from her dad that she was lying all along. He just drown himself with more sake.(guys! u know why)... She stood naked at the balcony where her dad found her - but she was not lost anymore, as her dad will always be there for her... This might be some sort of a discovery for herself... a self journey, maybe....All in all, this movie explores various level of human emotions in relationships - maybe love is not a myth after all... without love, human won't go through so much pain to learn and defend that level of depth. haven't u heard, Real love is when it hurts - Love HURTS....OBVIOUSLY, for those who haven't been there - including myself.... let's wait until the day when we are hurt... then, love is no longer a myth to us anymore...

The guy who wrote it is the same guy who wrote 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,' which is an outstanding, highly underrated movie. Both use a non-chronological narrative structure with multiple, overlapping stories; but it works much better in 'Burials' than in 'Babel.' Maybe it's that 'Babel' takes place in four different countries and five different languages, while 'Burials' deals with one continent and two languages.

Hit the bathroom first, it's 2 1/2 hrs long , and not much happiness, except at the wedding. It starts slow, builds slow, and ends slow. And the time shifts can make the plot (such as it is) confusing. It's not formulaic Hollywood, that's for sure. If you liked 21 Grams, you'll like this. If 21 Grams made you squirm, this one will too, maybe even more. I'll bet the third in the trilogy will be the most painful of all. I mean, we all know that death stinks, do we really need three movies to make that point?So, if you want fun at the movies, go to something else, this film is mostly sad. Sometimes random bad things happen to good people is the moral, I guess. The Japanese nightclub scene goes on fore ever, and the strobes can give you epilepsy.

It makes broad statements about controversial issues based on skewed assumptions and then immediately contradicts those assumptions. It offers no redemptive qualities in its characters or in its plot. It makes forays down endless rabbit trails that have nothing to do with the story. Wait...check that, it HAS no story. Scenes go on forever without point. Does the word ""EDITING"" mean anything to Innaritu? The cinematography is awful and made me so sick to my stomach I had to get up and walk around the theater to steady myself. I managed to stick it out to the end of this boorish, nonsensical movie.

808,info-11943,"Powerful, thoughtful and very moving.",10,13 February 2007,"Babel is a film that will really make you think. Anyone who knows the biblical story of the Tower of Babel may wonder if it has anything to do with that. (I wondered if it did.) The Tower of Babel is the story of humankind wanting to build a tower high enough to reach heaven. When God sees this, he is angry and makes everyone speak in different languages so they can't understand each other and can't build the tower. This film puts a very modern perspective on that story, demonstrating how society's and cultures misunderstand each other, often with tragic results. It's moving, upsetting in places but ultimately a lesson in how important it is to listen to other people, if you really want to understand them.",Babel

The three Phillie's for me, to a masterpiece firstly is a masterpiece script with talent and intensity. The second is characters that are in a position that you can put yourself into it. I mean, so real and honest character's, just like normal people, that when you see their agony, pain and loss of someone it just goes right trough you. And the last one is music. Music that put's your soul on fire. In Babel there is all these with so much power and emotional intensity that it just aches your heart.....babel is something else.

Several lives come together after a tragic event linking people across the globe. Although it is almost the same movie as 21 grams, right down to Brad Pitt's character looking the same as Benicio Del Torro's, I was captivated by the film for the first two hours or more. Unfortunately, the movie falls apart on it self and leaves you wanting more from both the characters and the story itself.The acting is phenomenal, the shots are well done, and the screenplay is written very well. Unfortunately, the movie left me with no impact. Had I not seen 21 Grams I may have loved Babel, but the similarities are too close to be missed resulting in a well done movie falling apart in the end.See it if you must, but I hope for the sake of the film industry that it doesn't win best picture.A real disappointment.",Babel

Meanwhile (in the US) there is a Mexican woman who takes care of the couple's children, since she is forced to watch over these children for another day, she decides, hey, why not take them to Mexico, and takes them south of the border to a wedding without telling the wife or her husband. And while all this is going on, they show some deaf Japanese chick try to get laid for filler.Somehow these stories are supposed to fit together and make a quality flick, but all i get from this movie is a turning stomach, Can someone please come out with a decent movie before I fly down to LA and start bombing the hell out of Hollywood.

Until then get ready for slow, pretty, sweeping pans across desert landscapes with nice, acoustic guitar background music... about 2 hours worth. At least an hour could have been knocked off this movie if scenes like these were trimmed down a bit... but even still, it would just drag on and on. I suppose Hollywood considers obnoxious pacing like this ""Powerful"".

813,Tim_Bartlett,The most brilliantly done waste of time i ever seen,3,5 August 2007,"I have a love for this director's work. The techniques he uses to develop characters and highlight parts of human nature are simply genius. His films are peppered with subtle details that are brilliant to the point that, even virtually unnoticed, they can play upon the sub-conscious; some usually unmoved viewers may find themselves intimate with the characters. This movie, on the other hand, despite being well done, was shallow. The story line was stale: A recycled story line that was reminiscent of 21 grams - a recent work of the same director. It comes down, simply enough, to intertwining lives. 21 grams though, was portrayed as a testament to the value of life. This was a theme that required a sort of neighborly intimacy between the characters; a story in which there was a possibly of all characters actually caring about one another.This movie wasn't even portrayed to have any ultimate point. It's a good thing that it didn't. I found that it was entirely too coincidental to have any moving effect. It seemed like there was no real commitment on the part of the writers. Just taking old ideas, setting them to a broader scale and trying to patch up the gaps by dishing out the rest of the movie's budget to a few celebrities. I think that's disgusting. Thank god this movie got an Oscar, otherwise I would fear that Alejandro González Iñárritu would find his carrier dwindling for his poor choice in story. Also, the sympathies given to the 4 different involved parties in this movie are horribly unbalanced.The real meanings behind this movie:North Americans underestimate the effect their actions have on other people. It doesn't take amazing chance to effect someone on the other side of the world.It's a bad idea to take a bunch of cranky seniors into the middle of a middle eastern desert. It's a bad idea to travel with seniors deprived of air conditioning.When it comes down to it, we really aren't all that interested in what effect we have on other people. The most we do is ask about them to be polite.It's OK if we be a little racist and not conclude some peoples stories... especially if they live where people smoke drugs.In short: excellent directing; horrible story. Maybe if they turned it into a satire it'd be good.",Babel
814,dogman304,Babel delivers a world of confusion!,8,21 February 2007,"Although Babel fails to fully develop story and characters, it doesn't really need to. The plot and theme revolve around the title: Babel. It is, of course, a Biblical allusion referring to the Tower of Babel in which God mixed/confused the languages of the people of the world so that they would not understand each other. This is what the film is truly about: miscommunication and a lack of understanding. There is plenty of frustration from the viewer's point of view, but that's the point; the viewer should be just as frustrated with the (lack of) communication as the characters are. Didn't give it a 9 because plot is a bit ""overdone"". Needs to back off a bit.",Babel

The reason it gets an Oscar nod is because Hollywood is so far up it's own ass, that even bad movies that are different get noticed. All you have to do is something outside the box. (not that this film is outside the box anymore seeing as how Crash, and 21 grams are virtually the same) I would have much rather watched a movie about the Morocco incident, rather than the others. This movie left me not caring who lived, who died, or anything. No character development. Acting was fine, cinematography fine, story telling non existent. Editing was terrible because half of the movie should have been left on the floor. I believe movies should tell a story and when they tell it well I love them.

817,btm007,A ridiculous misguided movie,3,1 April 2007,"This movie should be called Idiots, because everyone in the movie acts just like that, an idiot. First we have the husband and wife on vacation in Morocco, of all places. They are trying to reconcile the loss of one of there children and there failing marriage by leaving their two other kids at home with there illegal Mexican maid. This makes no sense. If you lost one of your kids why would you travel thousands of miles away from your children to a primitive country in order reconcile the loss of a child? Why didn't they all go to Disney world or some place nice where they can bond as a family? The trouble all starts when a Moroccan goat herder gives his two pre-adolescent sons a high-powered hunting riffle so they can kill the jackals that are killing his goats. He gives them 5-min of instruction on how to use the weapon and then sets them loose to guard the herd. How can he be suppressed that his 10 year old sun accidentally shoots at a bus and hits someone?The Fourth part of the movie, a story about a troubled deaf-mute Japanese girl is totally unrelated to the other three. the only thing thing it to the main story is that the hunting rifle used to belong to the Japanese girl's father. If the point of this movie was to show how similar and connected we all are, as most people say, it had exactly the opposite effect on me. If this movie shows anything at all it shows how different and unconnected we all are. The problems in this movie don't arise from miscommunication but by the stupidity of the characters involved. This movie only achieves legitimacy by it's top notch music and production. In almost all other areas the movie grossly misses the mark as a high-quality film.",Babel

The directing was juvenile, the biggest names in the movie had the smallest parts and the rest of the acting was method at best. There were many scenes which did not contributed to the plot or purpose of the movie in any way and gave me a sense that the production team was merely trying to ""kill time"" to fill a 2 hour quota, but it felt much much longer. Many points of the plot didn't ""add up"" and left the watcher with more questions than compliments. I'm all for subtitle films and even serious plots, which this was, but I haven't been this bored since ""The Weatherman"" atrocity. On a good note it was refreshing to see Brad Pitt in a role where he's not the ideal heart throb. This was a serious part and he played it seriously well.

820,xueyawen20,Babel,7,2 April 2007,"At the beginning of the earth, the whole earth had one language and the same words. People came to a plain and intended to build a city and a tower with its top in the heavens so that they could make a name for themselves. Their arrogance incurred the Lord's wrath. So the LORD confused their language so that they could not understand one another's speech. The LORD scattered them abroad and they left off building the city. The city is called Babel. Because there the LORD confused the language of the earth and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.An American couple connects four families somehow:(1) A Mexican family whose mother is their baby-sitter.(2) A Moroccan family whose son shot the wife indeliberately.(3) A Japanese family whose father gave the Moroccan a gun as a present with which his son shot the wife.Thus, the world is connected together. It seems that the world is flat. However, conflicts exist everywhere, both between different civilizations and in the same culture.A Moroccan bought a gun and gave it to his sons. The brothers quarreled for the younger's peeping the bathing woman through the crack of the wall. They played with the gun by shooting at the bus passing by. Unfortunately the younger shot an American traveler, the wife of the couple, when the bus went across. All the travelers were trapped in a Moroccan village where the wounded wife could be rescued. This couple had marital crisis, but when facing death, they realized that nothing was more important than life, love and family. Their companions, those American travelers, complained to the husband for the bad conditions in which they had to stay for a time. They left, leaving the couple in the village. The indeliberately shooting was soon escalated into a suspicion of terrorism or robbery. The Meroccan family were abused by the rough local police, and the older son was shot to death when the police fired with them. However, the Moroccans still treated the couple kind-heartedly. They helped them for nothing. The focus of the American government seems not so much rescue as the sensitivity of terrorism, for it was hurt so deeply on Sep.11, 2001. Meanwhile, the couple's baby-sitter, the Mexican woman, was eager to attend her son's wedding. But she could not find a substitute for her temporary leaving. So she had no choice but take the children to Mexico. Mexico, America's neighbor, is much poorer and backward. The children were staggered by an alien culture. When they went back, they were accused of illegal border crossing and illegal child-taking. Every year, there are thousands of illegal migrants from Mexico to America and they cause many crimes. However, case is not always the same. But law is no exception and no feeling to consider at all. The children were scared and suffered a lot when they were pursued by the police. As for the Japanese girl, she represented the distorted and abnormal Japanese character. She was dumb but eager to communicate with others. But in oriental countries the handicapped are not yet widely accepted by society. Yet her father loved her in a quite benignant and tolerant way.At last, the wounded wife was in operation at risk of amputation. The couple found back their lost love. Their baby-sitter was repatriated. She had to start a new life after leaving America where she had been living for twenty years. But she would have another special family reunion. The Japanese girl stood nakedly in the balcony and her father held her in a warm embrace.I cannot help asking what the significance of so-called democracy, peace, fraternity and tolerance and in what way we can put them into practice so that all human can benefit from the civilization created by themselves.In this sense, we say Babel not so much linguistically as psychologically. According to Babylonian language, "" Babel"" originally means "" the door of the LORD "". Only the mutual understanding, respect, tolerance and love can open this door to the heaven.

825,edleddy66,A self-contained beauty.,10,31 May 2007,"What is art? ""Babel"" is art. And one of the reasons I feel this way is because the value in experiencing this film lies outside the realm of verbal expression. So then how come I am sitting here trying to write something about it? Hmm? Possibly difficult to perceive fact: This film contains zero political or condescending/moralizing elements. Take another look and imagine you are a martian here for a visit. Iñárritu does not judge the structure of the world his story is set in, but he does use its features to show an underlying pathos, a pathos that exists despite the good or evil, heroism or cowardice, love, or fear, of any particular character in the film, or any particular larger circumstance that the characters find themselves in. Some reviews I have read here claim that the film is anti-gun, or anti-American, or pro ""peace love and happiness lets have a group hug"" preachy. These theories I think are defensive and wrong, or for the anti-gun, anti-American crowd, simplistic and wrong. Viewers who use these interpretations to either like the film or hate it don't understand ""Babel"". This is not a political film (sorry lefties), its a portrait of some of what its like to be human.The most precious quality Babel contains is that, because it is so self-contained, philosophically focused, and condescension free, the film itself becomes as beautiful as any story line within. This film shows us, slowly but surely, that we can trust its creator. I often found myself in places where I worryingly started to feel that there must be some patronizing lecture, or political agenda, or self-righteous propaganda around the next corner, but each time I turned that corner, those things were not there. And as those corners started to add up, it became all the more important that this continued, because I started to believe. I started to believe that ""holy cow"" this film could actually be Michael Moore B/S free, despite its Cannes accolades, and each corner I turned, I became more and more willing to trust the film maker, and loose my fear. I think Iñárritu asks us to trust him, and he handles our trust honorably.This film makes no mistakes. It has a mission, and it delivers, and in doing so it becomes the same thing it wanted to spotlight. Is that like Kafkaesque, or Wallacean?",Babel

I can see how the lack of communication leads to conflict in this world, but this film didn't clarify or convince me of something allot of us already know.I applaud that it might have exposed a few viewers to this notion and that is why they love it, but the circumstances are totally unrealistic and the characters make the kind of decisions you would see a one dimensional character making in those after school specials. It's almost an insult to my intelligence to suggest that we are supposed to relate to these characters in any way. Had the real conflict been that these characters were foiled by misunderstanding and miscommunication rather than wholly unrealistic and illogical decisions, then it would hold more credibility. Imagine rational decisions in this chaotic world that still lead to such disastrous circumstances. It might have had a chance to win an Oscar. It might have been as good as CHILDREN OF MEN. A sci-fi film on the surface which was STILL more realistic. But isn't that good of a film and the Academy agrees that this folly didn't deserve a win.3/10 stars for an excellent title, good camera work, and attempt to convey a meaningful message. An attempt that wholly misfires.",Babel
837,maciejbarczynski,Film worth seeing in silence with your mind opened!,9,5 May 2008,"Babel supposed to be the biblical tower that was meant to be built by human, led by their self-confidence, to reach God’s kingdom. God did not want this to happen so He mixed up the languages of the people, preventing them form finishing their work. I could not possibly find a more adequate title to this film. It’s a story of four families connected with each other with misfortune and coincidences, that destroyed their peaceful lives forever. I just could not get my eyes of the screen for the whole time. The story is not very complicated but it’s complexity is based on impulsive behavior and everyday mistakes, that all of us can make when luck is not on our side. The plot was well built and even though you could predict how will it develop, it was still very clever. Although the four stories were mixed up Babel was not hard to follow. From the technical point of view the film was very good. The director - Alejandro González Iñárritu - made an excellent film, and although it was not his first, it’s going to be the work that he will be remembered for. I loved the way the shots were taken and the whole filming. It was done absolutely naturally, without any unnecessary fireworks. Most of the shots was rolled dynamically. It’s because the only support that the cameras had, were the shoulders of the cameramen. I liked the idea of scenes where there were no background sounds, and the only thing you could hear, was the music. It was very well composed with the whole and it did not dominate. It did not had to. All the expressions and emotions were clearly visible because of the actors. The characters were not theatrical, on the contrary, they were incredibly life-like. I just could not hate those people although all the things they have done, what is more, I was filled with pity for them. Brad Pitt proved once again his acting skills. But he was not the only actor that deserved standing ovation. Chieko played by Rinko Kikuchi was a character that strongly aroused my compassion. The young Chinese actress was outstandingly convincing in her role. Also the Moroccan family was performed grate. Life is very fragile and we have to remember that not always we are the masters of our faith, because as the say: “faith is blind.” That’s only one of the lessons I have learned from Babel. It’s definitely a film worth of stopping and watching it in silence with your mind opened.",Babel
838,ahmed69,A Thought Provoking Movie,9,23 November 2007,"The movie want to tell us that in the 21 st Century, it is true that we are ""connected"" in spite of our Differences in: Cultural norms/values, in the places we live in & in our ethnic back grounds, But we still find difficulty ""to relate"" to each others, So; the director chose 3 different localities to make them seeming ""connected"" but let us confirm how they are actually ""different"" and each has its own World and unaware of the already existing Other Worlds. Still, each has its own problems, and all of them share a Global Misery! The Camera cleverly move with us from a mountainous desert area of Morocco where the life of the villagers close to be primitive and where European/American Tourists in air conditioned Bus look through the glass windows to that ""different"" World the Moroccan Villagers live in. 2 Kids of a Shepard play with a gun of their father then a Bullet get to the shoulder of the wife of the American tourist. The American couple were in their late forties, their relationship were at an edge, but the accident showed how they deeply love each others. The hunting Gun as we will know later, was of a Japp tourist who offered it to a clever Morrocan scout/guide, the latter sold it to a peasant and to his misfortune his kid, experimenting its range, fired it towards the bus almost killing the only American Lady in that Bus. So, the ""Gun"" will be the ""connecting"" tool between 3 continents: Africa, Asia & North America. We see How ""humanbeings"" get into ""sufferings"" due to the Faults/Errors done by others, while Authorities, as usual, are concerned with their closing the files without getting any blame. We see Police Brutality, Arrogance, Red Tape, in different continents but with different styles/methods. We see humans in different continents in ""needs"", these needs differ, but the humans share of being in needs but no one close enough to listen and then care for. I believe that everyone can interpret this movie "" Babel"" as he/she wish to, as he/she ready or not for getting the message, that whatever Technology makes us live as if in a global small village but we as humans are still far away from knowing about each others; so we practically do not know about each others needs, and then consequently short of helping each others to make the Life on our planet less suffering. That was my own understanding of the message in the movie.",Babel

It's a depressing movie, and it's depressing that it gets such good reviews. It was an interesting exposure of a few different cultures (is it accurate?). However, I couldn't connect with the characters in the movie enough to feel moved by the plights. Acting was acceptable, but the movie was mostly images of landscapes and characters with whom I had no connection as a viewer. Expect the movie to drag on, with no clear end, and when you feel you've been watching for 3 hours, you check and see you're only half way done.

843,MatGaw1987,Undevelopped story,4,15 June 2008,"""Babel"" left me confused. While I Can't deny that Innaritu handled with separate scenes quite well, and technically, in most aspects his picture was at least decent, my feelings about the movie as a whole, are as far from being positive as can be. the main drawback of the ""Babel"" is its story. As the title suggests, it sends us to the old testament interpreting the story about tower of babel, and focuses on the problem of communication barriers between people-barriers created by categories such as perception, language and context, in which every one of us lives by his own. The story is intentioned to bring universal meaning, so the idea to construct it from five sub-stories relatively loosely connected is quite good, as it brings opportunity to introduce the nature of the problem. The thing is, that at this point, the invention of the authors runs dry. Neither Innaritu (apart from directing, responsible also for the idea of the story), nor script writer have any idea of how to develop the topic. And so, all that remains from the ""abitious"" concept is the idea to make the characters suffer, hoping that the scale of tragedy that touches the protagonists will be enough to substitute the serious analysis of the problem. Unfortunately, it is not, and the effect is quite opposite, as all rules of probability are broke on the way. The one finds it really hard to identify with the characters, as they clearly have no slightest option to change their fortunes, and the fact that suffering is their UNESCAPEABLE destiny becomes obvious before the story even develops. We are simply being told everything on the beginning, and are left with nothing more till the end (even though the ending brings us the complete explanation of how the fortunes of main characters are connected, this still does not change the overall sound of the story).In desperate struggle to convince the audience about importance and depth of the film's message, the other aspects of the film are wasted. And so, though performances are decent, it would be rather hard to call them truly impressive. The characters are plain and underdeveloped . They are limited to the people we see in this particular moment, as we are given no insight into their life and personality. This leave the actors no opportunity to make something brilliant out of their roles, and even the most talented cast members (such as versatile Cate Blanchett, who is clearly limited by her character to do nothing more, than moan in pain for more than a half of the movie) can't do much from what they are given. I would be close to give the ""Babel"" really low mark. But not everything is totally wasted here. It's time for a word about camera work. As for cinematography, this maybe the one thing that really stands for ""Babel"". The mixture of long, stylized and short, ""nervous"" shots can be very impressive and perfectly fits with the intended feel of the story, which had to be a compilation of allegory and documentary accurate observation. Summing all this, ""Babel"" is not entirely bad film. When you wan't to decompose it and look at it's element's separately, you'll find them quite acceptable. Some of them can be even considered good in their own right. Unfortunately, the movie is THE SINGLE construction, and as such, ""Babel"" is, in my opinion, definitive failure.",Babel

849,wulfet,The incredible stupidity of most of the characters is beyond belief,3,2 July 2007,"I like most of the highly rated movies (6 to 7 out of 10 or more) I've seen lately. Babel was definitely one of the worst moderately highly rated movies I've seen recently. The characters in the movie do incredibly stupid things that make the movie border on implausible. Because of their collective stupidity, I did not have much sympathy for any of the characters that the director perhaps intended for the viewer to relate to.Lets start with the nanny. If she is the kind of person that would do something as irresponsible as take my kids without my permission to Mexico without me knowing about it, I would have fired her on the spot. I can't believe that she's been the kids' nanny since birth (they're now about 5-7 years old) and has not done something irresponsible and/or stupid during this time, causing me to get rid of her. Additionally, she gets in the car with a drunk driver and with kids in tow. Stupid. When she and the kids get dropped off by the drunk driver in the desert, she walks away from the road, making it more difficult for search teams to find her. Moreover, if there are known missing kids, there would be a massive search effort put into effect immediately; the border patrol wouldn't just take her back to the bush where she thought she left the kids to take a quick look around. Also, all the border patrol people should be at least somewhat proficient in Spanish, if not fluent. The fact that border patrol guards of Hispanic descent respond in English is not very realistic.Regarding the Brad Pitt/Cate Blanchett storyline in Morocco. I find it hard to believe that the other tourists would be so callous as to simply ditch the two, knowing that Cate is severely wounded and could die. I'm sure in a real life situation at least a few of them would stay behind and try to help or at least provide some moral support. Next, what kind of ""political issue"" would hold up a medical rescue team from getting to the village where Cate is wounded? This is not a political issue, this is a medical/humanitarian issue. Even in times of war, medicine usually comes first. Morocco of all places is not a particularly hostile country to the U.S., and can probably be considered an allied nation. What could possibly delay a helicopter in the scenario where a U.S. citizen is injured there? The scene where Pitt takes off her underwear so she can use the bedpan is also poorly constructed. That is not a tender, intimate moment, unless you consider seeing Cate's panties come off (even if its in the setting of needing to pee) tender and intimate.The shepherd's kids were just plain dumb. Who shoots rifles at buses for fun? Even though they're kids, that's just stupid. And then the scene where they're trying to run from the police while getting shot at makes no sense. People are dying needlessly when the truth can simply be told and everyone walks away without getting shot and killed.The deaf, slutty Japanese girl storyline was probably the least annoying of the story lines because it was, at least, somewhat plausible and interesting. She is marginalized for her disability and is also coming of age at the same time. Great.I guess, since the movie is called Babel, people can rationalize that the movie is about miscommunication between people of different languages and cultures (or even the same language and culture), leading to disastrous results. That's fine, and the movie does portray that, albeit in a somewhat weak and unrealistic way, but I think somehow they could've tried harder, thought smarter, and created a more intelligent film about that theme of miscommunication than simply showing people doing idiotic things, leading to tragedy, and trying to tie the disparate plots together loosely. The acting was pretty spotty. I hate to admit it but Brad Pitt is a pretty decent actor, consistently delivering characters that focus the viewer's attention, movie after movie. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't like the portrayal of the Japanese schoolgirl. The passive, frustrated, repressed, crying young Japanese girl thing is completely overplayed. Again this is more a matter of taste or opinion, but let's add another dimension to the character archetype next time: maybe a glimmer of strength in the midst of all that vulnerability or perhaps some sort of character growth/realization/development during the course of the movie. Again, the movie has a great concept -- showing the interplay of language and culture, as well as the globalization of the world, and the shrinking distances between people and cultures -- as well as great visuals, but things are kind of thrown together haphazardly and ridiculously, defying normal logic and insulting the intelligence of the discerning viewer. Plus, the movie languishes on unimportant scenes for far too long, slowing the movie down considerably. The movie could have probably been trimmed by at least half an hour and been a sharper, more focused film. Babel tries to be smart but is, in reality, pretty dumb.",Babel
850,elkindk,Another Tedious Jumble,3,15 September 2009,"Having recently watched Babel I would classify this movie as part of another in a long series of alienated laments modern directors are making about this so-called, ""Post 9-11 world."" I found it so boring, frustrating, and gratingly tedious that I eventually turned it off and only barely made it through on the second try.Inarritu (forgive the incorrect punctuation, please) has chalked himself up as another director interested in the ""everyday"" trials and tribulations of modern-day human beings all around the world, creating a world in which untoward tragedies strike normal people and exploring the consequences of these people's reactions. In the end we are meant to believe that this movie and others like it (""Crash"" comes to mind) offer an uplifting thought that, though things are complex and often terrible in our globalist reality, we are all latently connected and in this mess together. The problem with ""Babel,"" (and ""Crash"" comes to mind here, too) is that the director at no point offers any relatable characters, settings or situations to allow the viewer to connect to the things happening on the screen. With Babel, I felt like a viewer in an aquarium, watching terrible things happen to people who I absolutely could not care less about. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's characters are tragic on paper, with a disintegrating marriage thrown into relief by terrible circumstance. But they are both so one-dimensional as to make us completely unable to empathize with their troubles. There isn't a glimmer of personality between them, and no affection either, which makes us hate Cate Blanchett more than we long for the redemption of her marriage. And the Morroccan citizens they interact with neither bring something out of the American characters nor show something of their own dignity themselves, making the two tourists' predicament utterly sterile.The other character's share a similar plight, leading personality-less lives that, in the end, cast their stories into cliché. And this is the ultimate point: without convincing or particular character, any scenario is a cliché, a fable, making Babel a collection of fables with a ""message"" so hollow and uninteresting I'd expect it in a junior-high English paper before a feature film.As a result this movie strikes me as a very dull and frankly sophomoric lament about modern alienation. It has nothing new, convincing, or specific to say. Combine this with repetitive and sometimes even action-less unfolding of the plot which hammers the movie's purpose into your head, and we have a movie experience with no gratification.All-in-all, I'd like my money back.See also, ""Crash.""",Babel
851,dhippler,Hurt knows no boundaries.,7,18 September 2010,"A sequence of events unfold involving people from 4 countries that exhibits some of the biggest issues facing us today; communication, terrorism, immigration, and loneliness. A troubled American couple, Richard and Susan Jones, played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, vacationing in Morocco, fall victim to a random act of violence, 2 Moroccan boys take part in the accidental crime, a nanny, Amelia, played by Adriana Barraza, illegally crosses into Mexico with the Jones's children for a family event, and a Japanese teen, Chieko, played by Rinko Kikuchi, desperately seeks compassion and attention from her father or anyone in Tokyo after seeing her mother commit suicide. Separated by different cultures and long distances, each of these four unrelated groups of people hurtles towards a shared destiny of grief. Hurt knows no boundaries. The film Babel opens in the distant sands of the Moroccan desert, where a rifle shot rings out, a pure accident by 2 young Moroccan boys. Their family goes through a lot of hurt and the family soon falls apart because of their sons' careless mistake. Richard and Susan Jones apparently decided to take a trip to Morocco to re-build their relationship. You are not really told what the discontentment involves but the hurt from whatever happened is quite evident on Mrs. Jones's face in the beginning of the film. Mrs. Jones's relationship problems soon get displaced with physical hurt. They are on a bus guided tour when Mrs. Jones gets shot in the shoulder through the window. They are in the middle of know where and the bus and all its occupants have to make a detour to the nearest town to try and get help. The bus occupants are scared and restless being in a small town and an eventual mutiny of sorts leaves the Jones's behind in Morocco. Meanwhile back in San Diego, the Jones's nanny, Amelia's son is getting married down in Mexico and she is desperate to find someone to watch the kids so she can attend. In a last minute decision she decides to take the children with her which ends up being a costly mistake, including a dead nephew and being deported. Across the ocean a deaf-mute Japanese teenage girl, Chieko, throws herself at older men because her father does not give her the attention and nurturing she needs. Depressed, hurt and lonely after her mother's suicide, she acts out in several ways to get any type of attention she can.",Babel

There's always a proper dosage where a stereotype could help the plot. But when irrelevant stuff that has anything to do with the story is put there for free, that's sick and ridiculous.

Since he has some great movies I was kind of relieved to see the title BABEL come across the screen. How wrong I was. The director brings 4 separate stories which will connect on some elaborate way, showing us that all lives are connected. (I read this in some review in a movie magazine) But even if I had not read this article, I am sure that a person who watches this movie will need about 3 minutes to figure out how 3 out of 4 stories connect. And the connection of the 4th to the rest is ridiculously far fetched. The acting is good i guess but the story is about 3 minutes of interesting bits in it which is spread over a 90 minutes film.

Since they live in Southern California, a romantic getaway could include Carmel, Sonoma or Catalina Island, just to name a few. But where does Richard take his wife? MORROCCO. In the middle of the desert, where it's hot and stinking and primitive. What a guy! She's obviously annoyed when the healthiest thing at a ""restaurant"" (a hot dusty tent) is fried eggplant and hot Coke. So they get on a bus and she gets shot in the shoulder through a window. They get to a dirty village, so Richard calls his sister-in-law to contact the American Embassy. Way to handle an emergency! In the mean time, the nanny expected them home sooner, and it's her son's wedding day, so she drags two kids across the Mexican border, where they get to watch a live chicken get it's head twisted off and cooked for dinner. Of course a bit of freaky voodoo culture never hurt anyone. When it's time to leave and go back to San Diego, they get stopped at the border (big surprise) and try to make a run for it. Except the dude driving the car decided the nanny and the kids were dragging him down so he threw them out of the car into the desert. All this is intertwined with a bizarre story of a Japanese adolescent who likes to flash her hair pie at unsuspecting strangers. In the end, fortunately the children are found before they die of heat and dehydration, and Richard's wife also lives. He should be shot because if he had only planned a domestic holiday then none of this would have happened.

It's manipulative and a bit like a clichéd emotional roller-coaster. Where as the other films seemed more like the work of a non-Hollywood auteur type. This is definitely Hollywood including Pitt and Blanchette (which is okay it's just not what I was expecting from this director).There were other options for the movement of the plot. At each juncture it took you where you knew it would go and reinforced the idea that there is no evidence of individual choice or the pathos of intelligence perverted by the stupidity of social and political sterilization. People are really smarter than the multiple choice test modern life allows. The architecture of the exam imprisons intelligence and creativity. Contrary to Skinner, politicians, PR and branding we aren't stupid. The anomie of the Japanese girls, the estranged couple; these are clichés. To wit people die for and of cliché everyday: look at Iraq or Coca Cola in India. This movie did not tingle an ounce of compassion in me for our human plight. Each actor evinces a stupidity of denial. It is one thing to act and know you are being crushed by something larger with your own participation as your will gives way. Compassion can be felt for weakness in the face of the gravity of our limitations. This movie doesn't go there. Maybe we don't go there and that's my problem.",Babel
858,DuncanSinclair,Too much of a bad thing,4,20 February 2007,"This movie is depressing.Is that a spoiler? Hey, this is Inarritu. You didn't pay to see ""The Wizard of Oz."" Depressing I can handle, if it has the ring of truth. Check out Elem Klimov's anti-war masterpiece, ""Come and See."" The problem with ""Babel"", brilliant film-making though it is, is that Inarritu lays on the tragedy with a trowel. By the time the (second and final spoiler) Mexican nanny ends up trudging through the desert with her two gringo tykes on the verge of a dessicated death, I wanted to cry foul.But even this I could have accepted with quiet resignation, were it not for the film's dedication in the end credits: ""To my children - the brightest light in the darkest night."" Huh? It's as though Inarritu is saying, ""Hey kids, the world's really f***ed up. Here's a movie about how f***ed up it is - a gift from me to you."" Perhaps he was referring to a personal ""darkest night."" Same diff. Thanks, Dad.Mr Inarritu, how about making a movie about your children? With your prodigious talents, THAT I would love to see.Vegas should do ""Babel on Ice."" It would be a riot. At least until the boy gets shot.Oops. Another spoiler.",Babel
859,angie_m4,The intertwining storyline is getting a little old,6,11 January 2007,"I understand that Babel rounds off the trilogy that Innaritu and his scriptwriter started with Amores Perros and 21 Grams. I must say that I'm a little relieved. After movies like Pulp Fiction, Adaptation and most recently, Crash, Babel might seem a little tiresome. After all, we've seen enough movies with this kind of narrative that following the plot is not much of a challenge anymore. Those familiar with Innaritu's previous work, will know that the driving force of the narrative is the how the story switches between different groups of people who don't seem to be connected in any way, but are, and in Babel's case, some connections that are trifling. Richard and Susan - two American tourists on a visit to Morocco; Debbie and Mike - their children who are cared for by their Mexican nanny Amelia; Ahmed and Yussef - young Moroccan goatherds given a gun by their father to kill jackals who prey on their goats; Cheiko - a deaf-mute Japanese girl who is still dealing with her mother's recent suicide. So, where do all these people fit in? Pay attention: While Richard and Susan travel in a tour bus in Morocco, Susan gets shot by a mysterious gunman. The sniper is in fact, Ahmed, who was testing the gun's range. Meanwhile, in Southern California, Amelia is trying to find someone who can look after Debbie and Mike while she hops across the border to attend her son's wedding. On the other side of the international date line in Tokyo, the gun is traced to Chieko's father, who gave it to Ahmed's father in thanks for guiding him through the Moroccan wilderness. The running theme is that of miscommunication. That works wonderfully well in the two stories set in Morocco. The US government jumps the gun, branding Susan's shooting a terrorist act. The events that follow provide meat enough for a movie in itself, but the script requires that the story cuts back to two more tenuous connections that also would have been just fine as separate movies. In light of this, the movie has two stars, and they're not Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. They're Rinku Kikuchi (Cheiko) and Rodrigo Prieto (director of photography). Kikuchi proves that the year-long audition process for her role was worth it. She manages to convey the angst of a misunderstood teenager wrestling with several demons -- her mother's death, rejection from boys her age because of her disability, and the inability to connect with her father. Prieto beautifully captures the contrast between grimy, rocky Morocco and the almost sterile-looking Tokyo. As for Brad Pitt's much talked about Oscar nomination for this movie, in my book, doing a George Clooney (growing a scruffy beard and showing a little gray) doesn't qualify as an award-winning performance.",Babel
860,sleeps247,disappointing with very little movement,3,16 October 2006,"I saw this film in Austin at a pre-screening. I was severely disappointed. The opening shot sets the tone by being long and dull. Almost the whole film was shot in a ""hand-held"" style that is too jumpy for too long. It's okay to use this style for intensity and in certain moments, but not for the entire thing. You get an uncomfortable feeling, so much so, that you start thinking, ""I'm getting dizzy, the camera is moving way too much.""The film progresses very slowly. You have to wait 20 minutes before you get to see the main stars, and they aren't in it very much. The jump between story lines would be okay if you could see some significance in each of the stories. The tie to bring them together takes too long to arrive.Also, there is some graphic nudity that is far from necessary. The point would have been made without showing it.The only good thing is the acting. The actors performed well and help draw you in to their story, but the way story is shot and edited pulls you back out.I wasn't looking for much in this film, but apparently my standards weren't low enough.

This is a series of random events that happen to intersect in the smallest ways imaginable. Its the WORST movie I have ever seen. This is the only review I have given on this website because I just thought everyone deserved a fair warning before watching this movie because I did not receive any warning whatsoever. I watched it unprepared for the bland trash that this film provides and paid the price. The only reason I saw this was because it is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (Director of Birdman) so that I could have a feel for his work before I viewed the Best Picture winner. It made me completely change my mind about anything Iñárritu ever directs. I no longer have any faith in him. Please don't see this movie. SAVE YOURSELVES!,Babel

In Babel which stories interweave with each other, the Director comes back to his first film style Amores Perros, but this time even better, deeper, more complex performances by a master of acting Cate B. and a surprising Brad Pitt, it has not been since Thelma and Louise that I have seen him do such great work.

865,ionutvasilescu,Too bad that Brad Pitt was in such a bad movie,5,27 January 2007,"The idea of the movie is not really bad, but it is too much out of reality. All the events that take place exceed any possible or rational story. People are not that retarded or that stupid in reality, as they are presented to be, in the movie. I mean, come on: a baby-sitter that crosses border with two kids (she leaves US) and no one asks her about the kids, but all of a sudden the border police start asking questions about the kids when she wants to reenter the states. Imagine that: a Hispanic woman, in a car driven by a Mexican young man, with two American kids, and no one seems to find that curious, until they want to get back to America. THe women actually leaves the two kids in the desert all by themselves...mmm very plausible. She cannot find the way back to the main road, from the middle of the desert, but she had been taken to the middle of the desert in just 3 minutes of car ride. Come on...how far could they have gone into the desert in 2-3 minutes? How imbecile can two kids be to start shooting buses??? What in the name of GOD had all the Japanese story to do with all the other three stories? Just that the Japanese man had given his rifle some time ago to a Marocan guide. JUST THAT!!! And for that we had too watch a girl with serious emotional and hormonal problems. I think that the only thing close to reality in the movie is the y\way that Moroccan police acts and treats suspects: by biting them in the first place and after that asking questions, shooting upon the fugitives without any warning. And the entire movie is much much too long. Too slow. I think it's made in a manner that said the director had put himself a badge on his chest: ""I must impress, even if I push thing a little bit too far, I must impress the audience. The movie has too look (or to seem) very deep"".",Babel
866,kbskingdom-1,Story lost and never found- slice of life DOA,2,11 November 2006,"My first 20 minutes were spent believing a visual and artistic film was about to unfold. Sadly the film spent its remaining hours bouncing from one country to the next with no continuity, no subtle or blatant explanation of how the scenes would relate and why the hell the leads were in Morocco in the first place. With metaphor fired as sharply and ubiquitously as the bullet that blasted bus window and rendered Blanchett floor-bound and wounded for the rest of the movie, I am tired of the clichés that must permeate films in order for the public to understand-WE get it-please release the heavy hand to a job done in private!-- Must Japan be always displayed as oh-so-giggly,erotic,language-confused, with ""me no understand"" played out this time under a facade of deaf/mute characterization(see lost in-translation played out with Japanese people and movie stars instead) Must we review constantly ground already covered? We got the memo- the movie Crash with regard to Mexico, illegal immigrants who happen to be our grunts and US attitudes when cheap labor is not condoned - and when we look for a crazy, backwards society, we point our cameras middle eastward... why not look middle westward a la Borat's discoveries there?Has anyone considered making films about other places like looking into problems or schoolgirls with erotic desires in China lately; Korea and Vietnam society fun post war; Cuba and tit-for-tat embargo marching into history over freaking cigars; Australia and the endless police corruption there combined with an inability to fully appreciate spirit in the arts or talented nationals unless they are lauded first overseas(called tall poppy syndrome); New Zealand Maoris and their post- land and financial reparations still not being enough to settle history with, so claims to tribal ownership of national seashore and seabed abound; anorexia as a new presence in the pacific island culture; the horror of orphanages in Eastern Europe. For a better expose of human nature, behavior and cultural revelation, I look to the movie Borat, who under the cover of overt comedic behavior, scripting and acting, we are shown more of who we are and who surrounds us than any serious documentary or film playing drama in the last 15 years. The tragedy is that it takes the unraveling of the politically-correct defense system to affirm that there are still real humans with lives, ideas and attitudes that we need to admit to being present and influencing how the country move forward into its future.Miss this movie- performances from unknown actors were excellent though.",Babel
867,maliang03,Overly Artificial,7,25 January 2007,"First of all, I like many things about the film: the acting is solid from the entire cast and the cinematography is beautiful.On the other hand, what I disliked, and sometimes annoyed me about the film was its artificiality. There has been an excellent discussion on the message board about how often the characters have to make the inappropriate, inexplicable decisions to keep the story going. This really distracted me from enjoying the movie since it made me constantly and subconsciously asking myself: 'why on earth would he/she do that? ' There are other moments that I thought was unrealistic, in the Tokyo Disco bar scene for example, I think Chieko should also feel vibrations resulted from the heavy bass other than perceiving only visual as the movie intended to show us, I am not sure whether there is anyway to deliver that vibration, maybe some light base will do.Overall, the film is quite enjoyable if you can stand the logical odds here and there.

868,d0wdall,An unrealistic mess,5,14 June 2007,"Babel is a bore.A lot of the reviews I have read, not only here or else where have talked about a ""hard"" to watch film or of it grabbing its audience and dragging it through its rugged ride. I wish I could say the same.I found Babel easy to watch, plain, dull and totally non provoking in every sense. Therefore really failing in what it clearly attempted to do (no doubt attempting to jump on the bandwagon of films like the ridiculously patronising 'Crash'(2006)) and fails not only on that level, but that also of dramatic tension and irony (something the film loves to attempt with its little clues here and everywhere, that I found myself never buying any of them and by the end of the film becoming cynical of any information the film maker slipped in).A piece of narrative I need point out is unrealistic media circus that follows the events, similar events have very often in the modern day world and get half the attention. It seems like an unbelievable excuse for a film based in three country's.I don't want to talk about the style of the piece too much but I would like to ask the question, does every film maker in Hollywood think its audience has no attention span? Put your cameras on a tripod and calm your editing down. The hand-held do-it-yourself look is becoming cliché and dull.I'll keep this review short as I don't want to spoil it for those who decide to sit through it. For me the film was a massive disappointment mainly in the areas of acting, narrative, dialogue, exposition and especially the incredibly flat characters.5/10 - Weak, a failure from a director I would expect so much more from.",Babel

Giving kids guns and leaving them to use their own judgment?? Shooting at a moving vehicles for target practice?????

870,filipeacaeiro,Lack of communication... with the viewer?,5,24 February 2007,"Babel, as a film itself, is reasonably good. The plot, exceptionally written by Guillermo Arriaga, follows the same line of work that Iñárritu has accostumed us to in his movies, such as in 21 Grams. However, if you are going to watch this film expecting another masterpiece as 21 Grams, you'll be disappointed with it. In what concerns hooking the viewer to the characters and their problems and fears, the film fails indubitably, mainly because of the acting. Brad Pitt is never able to convince us as a desperated husband, Rinko Kikuchi can't give her character a certain madness/obsession that is necessary to justify her actions, most of the time she is actually laughing in an irritating way with her friends. On the other hand, there are some good points. The scene with Chieko in the nightclub, with the intermittent lights is one fine piece of art. The scene where Cate Blanchett's character urinates in a pan, with the help of Brad Pitt is a touching sequence. The soundtrack is one of the best in the last years. Unfortunately, there are some holes on the plot that leave a sensation of incompleteness in the film and that lower the quality of it.Good Points: - The soundtrack - Cate Blanchett - Mexico story - The Moroccan kidsBad Points: - Brad Pitt - The credibility of some characters - Japanese story - Plot Holes - Inability to establish an empathy between the viewer and the characters (except in the Mexican story) - Worse than 21 GramsBecause of this I rate this film with 5 points out of 10",Babel

Unfortunately, I saw a senseless production, that it could even probably shock a child with its stupidity.The complex connection between the events and the shifts in time show the professional vision of the author, but the reason for most of them is really shocking. I cannot believe that the decisions that grown mature people make are totally childish. I understand that there is a great amount of panic and fear involved, but even in such situations, a logically thinking human being would surely make much wiser decisions.That is why the main idea of the film: ""Look how much more you can suffer when you do stupid things!"", looks pointless.",Babel

People just don't care anymore.After seeing that part, I can't say the movie is even worth talking about, but I'll go ahead. The plot is pointless. There is no depth. Everything is far fetched, especially the role of the Japanese girl. I guess it was okay to sexually exploit her too, but not the sweet perfect girl next door wife of Brad Pitt, because it is called ""acting.""

I wished the director/screenwriters had dropped one of the stories and devoted more time to the 2 afghan boys and the Japanese girl.

876,hotdeliciousfood,It's not what the package says,6,24 November 2006,"This movie, while enjoyable, fast-paced,and poignant, has a sloppy and disconnected script. Unlike Crash, which carefully interweaves a handful of stories through the theme of prejudice, ""Babel"" is one story about an American family and an appendage about a sexually-frustrated Japanese deaf-mute teenager. Although the name ""Babel"" might lead you to think all the stories are bound by a common theme of disconnection based on language differences, the only place where language is the source of tension is in the story of the Japanese teen. The Japanese third of the story is heart-breaking and interesting, but its connection to the other part of the story is laughable and silly. As we discover at the end of the movie, the deaf-mute's father gave .27 caliber gun as a gift to his Berber hunting guide on an adventure in Morocco. This is the origin of the gun that shoots the American woman at the beginning of the film. Yeah. right.So, this Japanese appendage might work if the writers had found a strong parallel between the Japanese teenager and the other people. Well, there are efforts to show sexual frustration in the other parts of the story, all of which are ridiculous to the point of detracting from the central plot line. The Moroccan boy who shoots the American woman has an incestuous obsession with his sister, the American's Mexican nanny has an awkward make-out scene with a stout guest at her son's wedding, and Cate Blanchett somehow finds the strength to make out with Brad Pitt while there's a cartridge lodged in her neck. Yeah. Right.There is also this really cheesy camera shot of a cat that comes right before the Japanese heroine comes out of her room naked to seduce a detective she has a crush on.The interesting questions that the film asks are about the effects of US terrorism paranoia in Muslim countries, about cracking down on illegal immigration, and about the love lives of the disabled.

""Will robin be abducted by the evil henchman"" And the multiple story lines are unconnected, and really serve only to hide the writers inability to develop a character to any depth.You know, the use of meaningless suspense to develop a existential experience was pioneered in Mullholland Drive. Suspense however is a goal-oriented thing, not suitable to developing the experience of the moment.

HOW IS THIS IN ANY WAY RELEVANT TO ANYTHING? it is just vulgar.yes, everyone m (the same way everyone p and s) but we don't need to see that on film either!!! especially if its an underage child. This child and the teenage girl were locals, not professional actors. I wonder how much they paid them to exploit them in this way? then we see the Japanese gal so desperate to get laid shes flashing her v at total strangers. Don't tell me in a country like Japan where they have sexual harassment bars and vending machines selling used high school girl panties that pretty girl has never gotten laid. it's complete bull. and whats with the red herrings about the mom's method of suicide and that note she gave the cop? it's not ground breaking or creative, it's LAME.Cate Blanchetts character p on herself, p in a pot and then making out with Brad Pitt right after she p while he was holding the potty for her, don't even get me started! Unless water sports was a part of their regular routine??? the whole making everyone on the bus wait?? What The F? complete bull.the Moroccan cops opening fire at two little children and an old man when its already been established there are no terrorists there???

The story's are powerful and the acting making it even more so powerful.The script writing and production work make this a brilliant piece of cinema, the stand out part for me on this front is when we have a revelation about cheiko's mother (the Japanese story) and the soundtrack kicks in like an ephinany.

But that's unfortunately the best I can say for Innaritu and BABEL, because he made his point over and over and over to such redundancy that it masked how inherently flimsy the connections of the plot lines, themes, and characters were. BABEL is tied together by the most strained cohesiveness, and drowning in fatalism tinged with the ludicrous. It obviously has epic intentions, but the Tokyo story, the most subtle and humanist depiction of a young deaf girl's struggles to connect, turns out to be the most affecting. The Mexican chapter falls completely flat, climaxing in a clichéd desperate delirium in the desert that is painful to watch, for reasons beyond audience empathy for the nanny's agony. And real shame for the mishandling of Garcia Bernal, who does as much as possible with a throwaway part in lieu of his destiny of villianization and plot exorcism. Fine performances all round, and I fault no one for entrusting themselves to Innaritu's previously displayed talent-- which I myself still have hope for--but I cringe at the glowing reviews I see coming for this overambitious mess.

I mean, the boys were up a hill looking down toward the front right of the bus but the bullet entered into the lower part of the window on the left. I know its just semantics but I like accuracy and the angle was not probable. I was half wondering if the kids were being setup but alas i was thinking to deeply i guess :-). I wasn't very interested in the use of 'realism' with the boy needing to 'touch' himself or the shots of the Japanese teen's Punany, it didn't seem relevant more of just a need to add an odd sense of macabre truism. Oh well ya cant please them all.",Babel

886,retnepracrolyat,Oscar worthy! One of my top 2 films of 06,10,5 January 2007,"Let me start of by saying 21 Grams is one of my all time favorite movies, I'd consider it in my top 3. Babel is very similar as far as editing and the outline of the story goes, I love the way the two films unfold.There are absolutely no flaws in this movie as far as I'm concerned. From the script to the acting to the soundtrack. The score for each scene could not have been better. Alejandro González Iñárritu makes us feel as if we were in the scene.There are plenty of descriptions of this film, so I'm not going to indulge in redundancy but if you loved 21 Grams you will love Babel. Hopefully Alejandro González Iñárritu gets his gold this go around, SOMEBODY needs an award for this film!!! I would rate this or the Pursuit of Happiness as the two best films of 2006, both very insightful, artistic, well crafted, and most importantly ENTERTAINING!",Babel
887,madshep,Long live Cate Blanchett,10,13 November 2006,"Dear Cate, You moved me, again, from the deep deep of my heart. Elizabeth, Ripley, Veronica Guerin, the missing (with E.R. Wood, love you also), The aviator, bandit, HEAVEN, Coffee and Cigarettes, This life aquatic and so on...You are simply the best!!!Thank you! And since you'll be working with my favorite director (Mr Fincher), I love you even more! Benjamin Button will be unbelievable, it will be unbelievable!And thanks to Mr Inarritu for this movie, couldn't stop thinking I was watching a piece of humanity on screen. Last time it was Brokeback mountain. The time before, Million Dollar Baby.Please, academy, consider this!",Babel
888,blackdiamond_fj,Babel,9,15 July 2008,"This movie I must say was absolutely beautiful. At first it was hard to understand the producer's intention but towards the end I soon realized what it was. In a way the producer was trying to teach viewers about life and how we never really look and care about those around us. The mood, the act, all created for a very emotional tone. My hand goes out to the film maker and actors. I feel perhaps one of the most emotional scenes was of Brad Pitt crying on the phone. This forced the audience to feel not only for Brad but all the characters in the movie. The story of the two brothers made me think twice about stories I see on the news. In a way all our lives are connected we just have to look at those around and think about what we may not know.",Babel
889,movie5555,It is not about miscommunication,2,18 March 2007,"It is said this movie is about miscommunication but it was the last thing that went through my mind when I watched this movie. The movie consists of several separate stories that somehow are tied together. An American couple with marriage problem chose Morocco for vacation and bonding, probably not a good choice. Two young Moroccan boys are given a high power rife by their father without any training and implied responsibilities. A illegal house keeper decides to travel to Mexico to attend her son's wedding with her psycho cousin and take the two young children in care with her without parental permission, and finally there is this over sexed Japanese teenage girl who thinks the only reason that nobody wants to have sex with her is because she is deaf in but her other deaf friend have no problem finding boyfriends. She tries to seduce the dentist, police man, teenagers in street, etc. This movie also has technical problems such as Morocco is not the best vacation spot also is not known for big game hunting. Furthermore, the bus is only two hours from the nearest hospital but the husband decides going to a nearby village and wait for hours for an ambulance. This movie at best is about bad decision and consequences.",Babel
890,trixiness,It sucked,1,9 November 2006,"i'm sorry... i had passes to the press release...and this movie was so not interesting. it was NOT brad Pitt's best performance. i am just glad i didn't have to pay 8.50 to see it. I would recommend renting it than going to the theater. i was not the only one to feel this way. The whole theater conveyed these thoughts when the movie let out. it had unending plots. I think it was just a poorly planned out movie. Seriously, its not a GREAT movie. see it if you wish. But i am just warning that you will not get your money's worth. this is my honest opinion as a movie watcher. please don't bash me for this but i would like to know your opinion and thought on this movie.",Babel
891,ronfromrenaldo,Trashabel!,1,2 January 2017,Babel is essentially one condescending scene after another. In theory it sounds ideal; there are many characters all intertwined by the same depressing event. But the film does nothing to justify any of this. In the world of Babel parents lack any common sense and give loaded weapons and ammunition to their children to go play without supervision. Lets suspend our disbelief that the children are stupid enough to shoot at a bus for target practice. So the police are immediately searching for the shooters and one cop picks up some pebbles on the ground so they know they are from the middle of nowhere. The cops don't hesitate to assault civilians while interrogating them. They also think its OK to kick someone hard enough to break the persons ribs to extract some information. But when they see our child shooters they tell them not to walk between the graves. Apparently they only care about the people they are sworn to serve and protect if they freaking die!! Then they roll up on some unarmed civilians and right away they start shooting at them without even knowing who they really are and kill a boy in the process. But its alright they can simply explain later that it was a big misunderstanding! Our beautiful American tourist is shot and its all over the international news despite the fact that they are in a remote village with no members of the press to be seen. And the anxious husband decides to pull in to a village because he thinks there is a good doctor only to find a veterinarian with dirty hands attempting to stick a rusty needle in his wife's bloody arm. He is not compelled to get back on the bus but instead enables the torment and then acts like a maniac when the passengers curse him and threaten to leave him! Need i say more? I think you get the idea!,Babel
892,danhoward7,This movie was physically revolting in every way,1,26 February 2007,"I realize it's different... I realize that it was well acted... and the cinematography was excellent.However, this was literally the most depressing movie that I have ever seen...there is no redeeming quality to the story line. It's not compelling or entertaining...it's just one horrible event after the other amongst 4 loosely interconnected families.If you watch movies for entertainment value, I STRONGLY recommend not seeing this film. It's literally 3 hours of total and utter sadness and despair.",Babel
893,firefoxtwo,Bad Babel,1,14 March 2007,"This movie is truly the worst I have ever seen. The movie is a complete fantasy. Why didn't Brad Pitt send the bus on to get help? I don't care how hot a teenage girl is, she isn't going to want her dentist to feel her up. The director is completely out of touch. The guy has a real warped concept of reality. I don't think he has ever been out of Hollywood. A little too much ecstasy, there buddy. It sure is a racial slam to the Mexicans! I know most California has a racial problem with Hispanics, but this is over the top. Brad Pitt must have imported the Mexican nanny from Mexico himself. I can't believe this was even considered for a nomination. What kind of insane person takes his wife on a trip to Morocco? She looked really good. He should have taken her to a beach in Greece, and had a fun vacation. Why would you pay to travel Morocco in a hot bus, and look at brush, to save your marriage. What kind of fool is that? I think Brad Pitt is a great actor. He should have thrown that script in the garbage! The guy must have needed the money to pay the lawyer bills. We go to movies to feel good, or be challenged by the message. This movie has no message. If some of you think gun control was the message your wrong. Instead of a cheap Winchester it would have been an RPG. Those kids would have gotten the whole bus not just one passenger.",Babel
894,luisfrancisco,One of the year's best films,9,22 November 2006,"Magnificent work. González Iñárritu's way of telling a story that involves several countries keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole movie. Different stories across the world are interlaced in a creative way showing different cultures and languages with an impressive power. Actresses and actors deliver solid performances, and the photography is beautiful. It is not a movie for everyone, and opinions will probably be split between excellent and very boring. If you are able to enjoy stories with deep contents rather than a catchy storyline, you will probably find this movie very enticing. Language here is a strong vehicle to show different cultures and the way they interact in today's world. Definitely one of the year's best films.",Babel

At the end i felt like i had wasted my time and would rather have been doing anything else it left me asking what was the point and relating all these people together in the movie was ridiculous and again pointless and another thing why did this Mexican woman leave the kids out in the middle of the desert that was one of the dummest things i had ever seen if i had the choice i would rather participate in a game of Russian roulette than watch this again the dummest things i had ever seen if i had the choice i would rather participate in a game of Russian roulette than watch this again,Babel
896,takeshikawamoto,Wow,10,23 May 2017,"One of the best movies I ever watched. Kikuchi Rinko was incredible. But how I got there was very long. I watched Kong Skull Island and one of the stars Jing Tian was in Pacific Rim which also starred Kikuchi Rinko. Looking further into Kikuchi's career, I saw Kikuchi was nominated for an Oscar for Babel. When I watched that, I thought it was a great performance by Kikuchi, but also one of the best films I ever watched.",Babel
897,musifuti,If you really want to understand some problems in the world,10,20 December 2007,"If I had to choose which film is the best to have a global view of the world, without any doubt, I would choose 'Babel'. This tells a fictional story  but it could so easily be completely true  about an accident in Morocco which turns out to be beyond anyone's control. The characters are normal people, from very different parts of the world, from varied backgrounds in very diverse situations and with very disparate beliefs, but no one of them bears the guilt for the accident that has happened.Two naughty poor Moroccan children who live in the desert; a middle-class American couple, a Mexican nanny and a rich Japanese teenager (who is deaf) and her father make up a fantastic multicultural framework. All of these totally different people have their own problems, but all of them have the same kind of problem: communication. The problem is not with the language per se, but the fact that people don't want to listen, and that is the beginning of their troubles.This fabulous film shows you how everyday problems in the news could happen. It's amazing how this Mexican director, who has also made 'Amores Perros' and '21 Grams', can direct well-known actors such as Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett and yet everyone in this film has the same importance, whether they are established stars or not. The director's real achievement is that there is not only one main character, but there are different characters from around the world who are truly credible and because of this, the film is so lifelike. Iñárritu's absolutely brilliant method of filming, as a multiple story line, also emphasizes the idea of reality, making you think that the events are happening simultaneously, like in our everyday life.This is a masterpiece in terms of cinema because of its great film editing, which in my opinion is some of the best; but also this is a masterpiece in the way that it makes people think about the world situation  I myself, at least, couldn't get it out of my mind for some days.I think that if you want to understand how the world really works, how the problems of the world can happen, you must see this film and enjoy it for yourself just as I did.",Babel
898,gronke,You'll be seeing this film again during Oscar season,9,9 November 2006,"I really don't know where to begin here. This film absolutely left me stunned as I walked out. I suppose I can begin with a simple plot summary: Babel follows the four stories that are all touched by that of a rifle. A Japanese deaf girl coming of age, a poor Moroccan family trying to survive in the desert, a wealthy American couple vacationing in Morocco, and a Hispanic nanny hired to take care of the couple's children in San Diego. A event evolving this rifle ties all of them together.Sounds a lot like 2005's Crash, doesn't it? This film makes Crash look like Uwe Boll's worst. Babel does what Crash failed to do: It gives is real people. I haven't seen a more honest portrayal of people dealing with tragedy and prejudice for a long time. Don't let the review's fool you. The event involving the rifle in this film is, in this reviewer's opinion, simply a McGuffin of sorts. Iñárritu uses this as a device to explore how people react to situations of stress, tragedy, and how it makes people pull together and love each other even more.All in all, this is an excellent, excellent film and definitely worth the ticket price. Mark my words, you'll be seeing Babel's name come up again in Oscar season.This would be the first film that I'd be giving a perfect score to, however, Iñárritu's rendering of the United States government, namely that of Border Patrol, left me feeling a little bit uneasy and even angry at some points. I wonder if his own prejudices as a Hispanic had him leaving the Border Patrol agents as the only truly demonized force in this film.",Babel
899,imdb-10865,Some questions,9,4 February 2007,"I liked the movie a lot. The music is really good, but the story left me with some open questions. Maybe the other viewers can help.Here are the questions: 1. Why did Brad Pitt have to make all the tourists wait with the bus? Why couldn't they take his wife to a hospital by bus, and why was that so important to wait for an ambulance to come? 2. How come Amalia could not find anyone to stay with the kids? The family must have had friends and relatives in the area (they were not new there, as Amalia said she had been raising the kids since their birth).3. How come Amalia could freely go to Mexico through the border without being legally naturalized in the U.S.?4. How come the border police of both U.S. and Mexico let her cross the border to Mexico with 2 kids, and without proper papers?5. Trick question - what did the Japanese girl write to the policeman?",Babel
900,odl201,Disappointing,7,2 February 2007,"Babel isn't a bad film, some of the acting is top-notch, the cinematography is excellent and the soundtrack also very good. The problem is the plot, or lack of. And I realise that this isn't a plot-driven film, in the same way that Inarritu's other portmanteau films, Amores Perros and 21 Grams were not, but unlike those two superb films, I felt Babel failed to really keep my interest over 2 and a half hours. In places it was very poignant, and to say that very few people die in the film (either one or none, it is hard to tell with Ahmed), it managed to be thoroughly bleak, which is something of a testament to the acting and direction, but it seemed almost like three very touching moments dragged out over a very long film. I did, however, appreciate the refreshingly human portrayal of poor tribal Muslims in our current cultural of stereotyping. Not bad, but not as good as it could have been.",Babel
901,agoertsg,Voices of Babel,9,20 October 2006,"Babel had a lot to say and used intertwined stories to tell it. The movie was capable at discussing the narratives, often giving voice to those that aren't often portrayed in movies. The Mexican housekeeper's story is portrayed by her not being able to tell it. The Japanese teenager who can't hear the world tries so hard to tell it something. The third-world is given a voice in world politics. The display of the various narrations were interesting and never boring. The stories were strong and the voices were given volume through the story lines. In the end we are all human, we all have a voice to tell our stories and often the stories are similar. Frustration stems from miscommunication all over the world in all societies. Its not enough to have a voice- you have to be able to listen to other people's voices.",Babel

903,m-begley3,this is the best film i've seen for a very long time,10,28 January 2007,"I was told at a party 'don't bother to go and see the new brad Pitt movie' I don't know what this person looks for in a movie, but i'm convinced they must have had a head transplant or a series of electrical shock treatments that rendered them apathetic and desensitised to any emotion at all. This is a great movie, It operates on so many different levels. A challenging film to watch and a dream to keep up with. It's a struggle to decide whether it's the style or the concept that grabs you most, both are equally appealing. The film drifts in and out of so many diverse locations and situations whilst maintaining a trust-fired thread that keeps you on your toes.Told in a series of three main stories, each episode is as diverse as you could ever imagine, blends perfectly together en route until the end. This is a mature film that reaches a depth of feeling that comes 'right back at ya' Visually it's a masterpiece that supports and encapsulates the idea of 'culture' and our 'cultural diversities' It cleverly 'gels' and combines the gap between the progressive western world and the supposedly naive and redundant simple lifestyle of a 'lonely goat heard'. It's the 'butterfly effect' in action and if i have to comment on the 'Brad Pitt Effect' I'd have to say that his scenes with Cate Blanchette were so touching. This is not a Brad Pitt movie ... it's so so much more,",Babel
904,stubail,predictable and prolongated,1,3 January 2007,"Babel - i expected a good movie from the director of 21Grams but got a load of meaningless human frivolous behaviour. The connection between the story lines was anticipated, no surprises there! It was almost 'cringe' factor when 'Brad and Cate' embraced while she was taking a pee. Why, maybe then if she had picked up the pan and tipped it's contents over Pitt's head (for being a bad father) - we wouldn't have seen that coming! The deaf-mute Japanese girl was a story within itself but limped along, having little bearing on the intertwining story. I gave this movie 1 out of 10 because of the haunting music. Don't waste your time seeing this tripe - I want my money back.",Babel

I couldn't figure out.The Japan sequences where funny initially but got boring pretty soon. Until the suicide story gets revealed. I have a question. I didn't understand what was in the note the Japanese girl passes on to the police detective in the end. I thought it would have said 'Thank you for being my friend' but it had a lot of lines. Any clues about what was in that note? Great photography. Good music too. The credits listed is very confusing. About five people in the Morocco plot, two Americans and their two children, four Japanese and four Mexicans are the key players.",Babel
906,supexcellency-1,Crash was a rip off!,9,5 February 2007,"A lot of people out there have said that BABEL is a copy of the movie Crash. In fact, what most people don't know is that Crash was a cheap rip off of González Iñárritu's movie Amores Perros, which was the first of the ""connecting lifes"" genre. If you watch all movies, you might end up finding out that Crash really was a cheap imitation of Iñárritu's work. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.Having said that I will say now that even though Babel wasn't the best movie of the century, it is definitely a great movie. It is full of suspense and thrill in every single story it tells. If you haven't, go see the movie, and think of it as the continuing work of an outstanding director and his usual staff.",Babel
907,skysmith,Absolute artsy fartsy trash,1,13 August 2007,"This was bar none the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to see. It should have been named ""Fragmented Farce"". It was so heavy handed with political overtones and obvious 'messages' about the evil of guns, the plight of illegal immigrants (excuse me, but MY ancestors were both American Indian and European...and the European half did have to follow the rules and apply for citizenship.. I have no sympathy for those who think criminally being here entitles them to freebie citizenship), the fat headed helplessness of Americans, the poor rest of the world that has to put up with US citizens, and a plot line so fragmented and boring that it had to resort to masturbation and a teen waving her panty-less crotch to fulfill the mandatory sex scenes. Sick! Pitt couldn't even save this crotch of a picture. And yes, I am fully aware of the artsy intent, and that those of us who see it for the piece of garbage it is will be called dense and unsophisticated. The best lines in the movie were the lines we started making up along the way. As to the music, it was as bad as a drunk playing a cello. Muting the sucker was the best way to get thru the off-key scratchings considered to be music. This sucked bigger than a black hole.",Babel
908,smooligans,Babel Is Horrible,2,25 February 2007,"I just wasted more than 2 hours of my life by going and seeing Babel. However deep and intense the plot was supposed to be, it wasn't. It was so disjointed it made my head hurt. Even though everything was connected in some odd fashion, it was so random that it just didn't work. The story line left me with a lot of questions.It wasn't very clear what was going on with the Japanese girl. First she seemed like a prostitute, then she seemed like a desperate nympho, then she seemed like a suicide waiting to happen. At the end of the movie nothing was explained about her, you were just left hanging there.The Moroccan boy's fate was also left up in the air. Was this artful cinematography? I think not. I think it was the director's desperate attempt to wrap the movie up before the audience got too bored to sit through it any longer. Primary point: this movie is not deep, it is not intense, it is not an Oscar deserving movie. As always someone died, someone survived, and someone got deported and cried about it.Did it make you think? Yes it did. ""Why the hell did I sit through that as long as I did?""",Babel
909,droid72,America is disconnected and hateful,4,7 January 2007,"Do you hate America? If the answer is yes, you might like this movie. Yea, it's disjointed as a jellyfish blasted point blank with an elephant gun, but hey, it's shot very well and has actors in it... Brad Pitt for one, man. That counts for something, right?Basically, a blonde, American woman is shot in an Islamic country and it's somehow preposterous and outrageous to think that there might be a terrorist link, so that leads to a whole lot of trouble. America and its militaristic, barbaric influence turns out to be the real bad guy, not the idiot, goat herder kids firing a high-powered sniper rifle at a civilian tour bus for target practice.Let's see, what else? A gun-toting Mexican thug screws with a couple of US border patrol officers, slams the gas down in his car and unlawfully flees the checkpoint during a mild interogation, yet the horrible, evil US wants to deport an illegal alien for being in the car with the blatantly, law-breaking thug. Wow, isn't the US evil?There is a cute, very young, slutty Japanese girl that we are supposed to relate with for some reason. She's real slutty and cute and very young. She flashes her young vagina to the camera a couple of times and tries to casually screw a handful of adult men. That's really about it...The philosophy of this movie is that, America is evil, disconnected and hateful, and poor Hispanic and Islamnic countries are actively being oppressed by the imperialistic and Nazi- like U.S.A. It's not even veiled a little bit. If you buy into that stuff, you will think this pic is the best.Pretty fashionable stuff these days. Like I said, it's shot very well...",Babel

May be years... When the things will change from bad to worse... Like a good wine, you know... The film is like a puzzle and you will not get the idea of the title if you do not see ""the end"".

We often do this and usually I suffer because she always picks. But her choice of Babel was beyond the pale - notice I'm writing about it years later, that's how angry it made me. Why? It's all documented in the other low reviews, but even moreso with this example: I walked out of the movie and had to wait for my mom out in the mall. When she finally arrived, she was mad as hell at me, though to me that seemed most illogical. She never spoke the rest of that evening.

The rhythm with which Iñárritu displayed an impeccable piece of direction was captivating. To start off with, the whole mix of cast from different cultural backgrounds was incredible. Their acting was the hallmark of this movie. I was left wondering, can such an event of innocence coupled with the impetus to explore the exterior mind spark a tale which hops across continents. This movie replete with gripping emotions and innate drama showed us that this little world we have imprinted in our selfish minds is indeed a large one. This subtle manifestation is exemplary in its true form. The chords of Man and Mankind were struck with great elegance.In all a beautiful movie and is sure to make you think of what we possess and to make a good use by lending our helping hand.

From the first parts,how can I believe a boy is that stupid to shoot a bus.And even if he is how could he do it that excellent?!If you watch the movie carefully you can see that the way the woman gets shot does not follow the direction the bullet was shot! Or how should I believe that not having sex,all of a sudden,has made such a dark world for a girl that falls in love with whoever she see?! What was the reason that police found it necessary to shoot a man with two boys?!and what does make cops continue such a stupidity to kill the sun?! It is better not to talk about the children,s nurse and the family,because they made almost all of mistakes to ruin their lives. But still I think it was a must see movie.The screen writer wanted to depict some valuable points,but he was not successful in convincing audiences that all these could happen.It was thought provoking but not thoughtful.If it was it could be a real masterpiece,just like crash.I give it 7/10.",Babel
917,sranauta,This comment is about the shooting style only - may cause nausea to some,6,22 January 2007,After CRASH and SYRIANA the subject matter is old.I have a major complaint however about the camera work in this movie and another recent movie - Children of Men.A lot of the shots are done using a long lens (ie zoomed in) with hand held cameras.The resulting camera shake has resulted in my feeling sea sick in both movies to the extent that I had to cover my eyes and follow the movie by sound only.Shot length is also often irritatingly small. There is a minimum length of shot that is required for a viewer to absorb the material. If this style is to be adopted then it needs a lot of careful timing so as not to cause irritation.,Babel
918,lindalinaka,This movie was disappointing,1,1 December 2006,"I must say, I don't understand why critics liked this movie. I went with friends and the whole theater seemed to be on the same level of not liking this movie. It was boring, and although I know the tag line remarks on understanding and listening, this movie went in too many directions and the message was understood, but was poorly done. It seemed some story lines were dragged out and others really didn't need to be there. One story line was not expected and that is the one that didn't really need to be there. Brad Pitt was OK acting wise, but the theme was horrible. It just didn't seem like they chose the right way to convey their message. Sure, the concept was there, but the actual guts of the movie was weak and didn't keep my attention. My daughter left to go to the restroom and I thought she wouldn't come back, later she told me that she was considering that option. I was very disappointed that I went based on critic reviews. My rating of awful was accurate as far as I am concerned.",Babel
919,aliveb,Arriaga Does it Again-- with a little help!,10,11 November 2006,"Guillermo Arriaga is my favorite screenwriter, he has contributed immensely to the re-establishment of Mexico as one of the hubs of the movie making world. We also must recognize the influence of great Mexican writers who developed the Magical-Realism trend in literature. Just as in the 'Three Burials' film me can see in 'Babel' the influence of Juan Rulfo. Some of the Moroccan scenes reminded me of the imagery of Juan Rulfo's 'Llano en llamas'. Mexican author Alberto Ruy Sanchez has also used Morocco as a backdrop for his trilogy of novels. Nevertheless, Arriaga deserves praise and support for challenging our minds the way he does.",Babel
