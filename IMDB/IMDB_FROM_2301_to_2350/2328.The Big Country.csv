0,MartinHafer,The best Western EVER,10,25 May 2005,"Although there are some exceptional Westerns (such as The Oxbow Incident, The Gunfighter and The Fastest Gun Alive), this is my favorite.I must first point out that Westerns are NOT among my favorite movies. I like them in small doses or when they rise above the crowd.This movie is GREAT in so many ways. First, the soundtrack is tops. It's magnificent in scope and fits the movie so well. Second, the acting is great. Particular standouts are Gregory Peck (as the strong, confident yet humble newcomer), Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford and Burl Ives. Overall, this movie seemed to best showcase Ives and Peck, as their characters were so solidly written and mesmerizing. Third, as alluded to in the last sentence, the writing was incredible and it was in many ways an ""anti-Western"" that deliberately avoided clichés and debunked some of the macho excessiveness of some Westerns. Fourth, the brilliantly paced and masterful direction of William Wyler (perhaps the greatest Director who ever lived).This is the plot in a nutshell: Gregory Peck is an Easterner who had been a ship's captain who met a girl (Carol Baker) and agreed to marry her and move back west with her. It turns out her father (Bickford) owns most of the county and is way too adamant on proving his machismo--particularly when it came to altercations with another big-shot landowner (Ives) who is his rival. The problems all begin when Ives' son (Chuck Conners) and his buddies give Peck a nasty hazing. Peck laughs it off but Bickford is bound and determined to ""teach that trashy clan a lesson"".It becomes painfully obvious through the course of the movie that BOTH patriarchs are pig-headed bullies who won't back down until their rival is pushing up daisies! Peck realizes this rather quickly but is disheartened that his fiancée is all for a countrywide bloodbath. Her lust for revenge and mayhem drives poor Gregory Peck away--into the arms of the luscious schoolmarm (Jean Simmons--not THE Gene Simmons from KISS, but the actress).As a compromise, Peck offers to buy a piece of land under dispute by the two patriarchs and give them BOTH equal access to the land. Neither one really wants this solution, as it will preclude them from killing each other.I won't tell more about the basic plot or the conclusion, as it would spoil the experience, though there are a few WONDERFUL moments I want to highlight.First, the cowboys try to get Peck on an evil (and seemingly unbreakable) horse, but he declines. They think he's ""yellow"" but he just doesn't think he has to prove himself to others. Instead, when no one other than Raoul (the servant--who is exceptionally well-played), he tries again and again to ride the horse until he ultimately succeeds into saddle-breaking it.Second, for much of the movie, Charlton Heston (Bickford's foreman) is itching for a fight with Peck. Again and again, Peck backs off--not because of perceived cowardice but because he has neither an argument with him nor did he feel I needed to fight. Now remember, Peck was introduced as an ex-sea captain--this was certainly NOT a wimpy profession, but he was so self-confident in his own masculinity that he just felt no need to prove anything to himself or his fiancée. Finally, after repeated provocations, Peck agrees to fight but not publicly. Instead, they fight all alone in an open field. The fight lasts for what seems like hours, as they exchange blow after blow. All this is shown NOT with the typical closeup, but with a DISTANT shot in order to avoid glamorized the fight. Finally, after they both are spent, Peck asks Heston if this REALLY accomplished ANYTHING! This was a beautiful moment.Overall, I think this movie's theme is REAL masculinity versus FAKE put-on masculinity and it does a masterful job.",The Big Country
1,bkoganbing,"""How Many Times Does A Man Have To Win You?""",9,30 January 2006,"The Big Country is one big and fun western with concurrent plot lines. The first is the struggle between two implacable enemies, Charles Bickford and Burl Ives. The second is a four sided romantic triangle involving Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Charlton Heston, and Carroll Baker with Chuck Connors trying to horn in.William Wyler directed the almost three hour western with a sure hand and your interest does not wane for one minute in this film. Gregory Peck also was a co-producer on this film as well as the first billed. He had a hand in casting a lot of the film, specifically Burl Ives in his Academy Award winning performance as Rufus Hannessy.It's the Terrills versus the Hannessys. Charles Bickford is the local Ponderosa owner Major Terrill. Presumably the title comes from the Civil War. Bickford does play Terrill with a military bearing. My guess is that he was a Yankee soldier.The Hannessys would now be called white trash. They look like hillbilly folk who also came west for fame and fortune. They've also got a big spread in a place called Blanco Canyon. They hate the Yankee Major as much as he hates them.Sitting between them is Jean Simmons who has inherited a modest piece of land that sits across a river that both outfits water their cattle on as per an agreement with her late grandfather. She doesn't work the land herself any more, she teaches school in town. Simmons tries to keep above the feud. She is friends with Carroll Baker, Charles Bickford's daughter. She's been east and is bringing home a prospective bridegroom who is a former sea captain played by Gregory Peck. That doesn't sit well with Charlton Heston who is the Terrill foreman. He's got eyes on Baker himself and Chuck Connors who is Burl Ives eldest son has eyes for Simmons when he's not in the local bordello.A lot of started and broken relationships and a few of the cast members being killed occurs in The Big Country. My favorite scene and line in the film is when Burl Ives gives some advice to Chuck Connors on how to woo and win Jean Simmons. His big advice is to show her how much you care by taking a bath occasionally.Charlton Heston took a role that was fourth billed because he wanted the opportunity to work with William Wyler. That was one great career move because Wyler and he hit it off so well that Wyler signed him for the lead in his next film which turned out to be Ben-Hur. Heston in his memoirs, conservative as he became, says he also got along very well with Gregory Peck who he called a ""thinking man's liberal.""Peck and Wyler had worked together previously on Roman Holiday and had done good work there and also hit it off. However with Peck as a co-producer as well as star they had some clashes on the set. One notable one involved Peck wanting to retake the carriage scene where the Hannessy brothers attack Peck and Baker on the way to the Bickford ranch. Peck wasn't satisfied and wanted a retake. Wyler who was legendary for doing scenes dozens of times until he got what he wanted refused. Later when shown the finished film, Wyler had edited out and around what Peck didn't like and it came out OK. They remained friends, but never worked together again.Simmons as the independent minded school teacher and Baker as the spoiled daddy's little girl acquit themselves well in their roles. Baker is disappointed in Peck not seeing him as her ideal western man and Simmons upbraids her with the quote I put in the review title.This is also the final film of Alfonso Bedoya who never did get a role in an American film as good as the one he had as Gold Hat in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Still this is a fine farewell performance to a very colorful and talented player.When he's on the screen Burl Ives dominates and fills it and not just physically either. Rufus Hannessy may not be to the manor born, but he has his own sense of integrity and fair play. All that Burl Ives captured in Rufus and The Big Country is worth watching just for him alone.And that Jerome Moross score; simply one of the best ever done in the history of film.",The Big Country
2,Leofwine_draca,"Everything's good, apart from the 2h45m running time",6,30 January 2017,"THE BIG COUNTRY is a grand old American western pairing William Wyler and Gregory Peck. The film is best known these days for its excellent and stirring theme music which has gone down in film history as one of the best of all time. Other than that, it feels largely dated as a western, a film more in line with the types of genre movies that John Ford was making in the 1940s rather than the action-packed offerings that, say, John Wayne churned out in the 1950s.This certainly isn't a bad film and there's plenty to recommend it here, not least Wyler's sweeping vistas and the all-star cast. The film's sole problem is the running time; at nearly three hours, this is just way too long and gives the movie numerous pacing issues. I think if they'd lost an hour of the romantic scenes and the endless non-furtherance of the plot with Jean Simmons' character, it would have been a lot better.Still, fans of Gregory Peck will be rewarded by another dependable turn from the star, and the supporting players are to die for. I only know Burt Ives from his sweet Disney roles but he makes for a fine and imposing villain, supported well by Chuck Connors playing his son. Charlton Heston appears on the cusp of stardom with BEN HUR to follow shortly, and Carroll Baker brings feistiness to her part. There are plenty of memorable set-pieces here, it's just that patience-testing running time that's at fault.",The Big Country
3,SnoopyStyle,Big Grand Traditional Western,7,15 February 2014,"Peaceful Jim McKay (Gregory Peck) is a wealthy shipping line owner from the east. He has just arrived to marry fiancée Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker), and lands himself in the middle of a land war in the west. Pat is the spoiled daughter of her wealthy commanding father Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford). Their ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) dislikes Jim almost immediately. The Major and the Hannassey clan battle over land owned by Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons).This is an old fashion western, the oldest of fashion. There are some great actors at work. It's big. The scenery is grand. The characters are big. Subtlety is not this movie's biggest asset. Everybody is bigger than life. Gregory Peck, Charles Bickford and Charlton Heston are all impossibly gigantic men. It does have some funny light hearted moments like Jim trying to ride the horse. But mostly it's a grand ole time.",The Big Country
4,classicsoncall,"""If there's anything I admire more than a devoted friend, it's a determined enemy"".",8,6 October 2008,"Here's the kind of film I particularly enjoy, a nicely nuanced psychological Western that attempts to get inside the head of it's heroes and villains. The strength of the story lies in the character of James McKay, masterfully played to Atticus Finch like sensibility by Gregory Peck. In fact, one often feels like Peck should be showing more emotion given some of the situations he finds himself in. He does cut loose though in a brawling fight against Terrill foreman Steve Leech, which made me stop to think about something. Has there ever been an on screen fist fight between any greater pair of movie icons than Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston? That's not to say it was the best Western movie fight ever, but the one featuring two of the biggest stars. I'm going to have to keep thinking about that one.I was pretty convinced right from her introduction in the picture, that Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker) wasn't going to wind up as McKay's wife, even though she started out as his fiancée. In that regard, she showed some of her father's temperament, with a reliance on eye for an eye type justice to settle a score. With Easterner McKay's unwillingness to prove himself at every turn, you have the wedge that eventually begins to unravel any attempt at matrimony. That void begins to be replaced by the charm and manner of Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), owner of the 'Big Muddy', and a focal point of contention between the picture's feuding families, the Terrill's and the Hannassy's. This was my first look at Burl Ives in a villainous role, and he appeared made for the part of the Hannassy patriarch. Didn't you just cringe each time he put down one of his own sons, especially big old Chuck Connors as Buck Hannassy. I don't know if I care much for Connors as a heel after seeing all those 'Rifleman' episodes, but he did put some gusto into the role.This might seem like a little thing, but I got a kick out of that scene when Old Thunder did the gimmick with the blanket giving Ramon (Alfonso Bedoya) the fits. I say that because it wasn't the first time I'd seen something like it. Roy Rogers' horse Trigger pulled off a similar stunt in the 1952 film ""Son of Paleface"". It made me wonder if Trigger might have trained Old Thunder for the part.Speaking of that fight between Jim McKay and Steve Leech, keep an eye on the ensuing scene on the morning of the next day. Leech is talking to one of his ranch hands, and the only mark on his face is a slight bruise on his upper left cheek. However in the next scene, after running off the Hannassy's at Big Muddy, he has a cut on his lower lip, while talking to Buck Hannassy. Later on in the picture, the cut disappears.Somewhat oddly, for all of his importance to the story, Jim McKay doesn't figure directly in the picture's finale. It's almost as if you could have had the same story without his presence, except then you wouldn't have all of the character driven focus on integrity and values that defined where the story was going. Besides that, McKay was essentially out of his element as the displaced Easterner from Boston, so in that respect, you don't really get a sense of how he'd fare in a one on one show down. In one of my favorites of the genre, Gregory Peck appears in the 1950 Western, ""The Gunfighter"", where he portrays a reformed outlaw, the Ringo Kid. It's another psychological Western that deals with the oft recurring theme of brash upstarts trying to take down a legendary gun man to enhance their own reputation. The twist at the ending is one of those be careful what you wish for scenarios at the expense of the Ringo Kid.NOTE - Added on 10/17/08 - Regarding fight scenes between legendary actors, the 1939 film ""The Oklahoma Kid"" features a great bar room brawl between Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney.",The Big Country
5,lee_eisenberg,that frontier life was something else,7,7 August 2005,"Usually, when movie characters utter their movie's title, it's deliberately campy; or if it's not, then the movie's pretty idiotic. Not so with ""The Big Country"". It is actually an epic masterpiece. James McKay (Gregory Peck) is a sailor who moves to a Texas ranch in the late 1800s. This is a totally different environment for him, and so not only does he have sort of a hard time adjusting, but his very presence may be turning some people against each other.Some ""big"" movies were epic to the point of being leaden, but not this one. ""The Big Country"" always has something good to say about whatever aspect. And Carroll Baker, Burl Ives, Jean Simmons and Charlton Heston all provide some good support, with near perfect direction by William Wyler. This may have been Wyler's best movie ever (""Ben-Hur"" actually was epic to the point of being leaden).",The Big Country
6,jboothmillard,The Big Country,8,26 January 2012,"From director William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Mrs. Miniver, Ben-Hur, Funny Girl), I saw this film once before when I borrowed it from college, but obviously I dozed off during it, so I was glad to watch it again properly. Basically James McKay (Gregory Peck) is the retired, wealthy sea captain who has travelled to the American West to be with Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker), his fiancée, along with her father Maj. Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford), at their large ranch. McKay is obviously a stranger to the town, and he has already made a few enemies, including Steve Leech (Charlton Heston), but there is also the feud going on between Terrill and Rufus Hannassey (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Burl Ives). Caught in the middle of the feud is also schoolteacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), who allows Hannassey to use her water for his cattle, and Terrill is trying to buy her land to put him out of business. McKay is choosing to ignore and not be any part of the feuding, even with Hannassey's son Buck (Chuck Connors) harassing him, but with things getting tense he does learn to ride a horse, only telling ranch hand Ramón Guiteras (Alfonso Bedoya) about it. McKay soon rides to the Big Muddy, the land that Julie owns, and she agrees to let him buy it, as long as she carries on like normal with Hannassey borrowing water, and he again refuses a confrontation against Leech, and he and Patricia reconsider their engagement plans. Eventually McKay and Leech do have a fight, using fists not guns, and afterwards Leech does learn to respect his rival, but next, after moving into town, he has angered Patricia when she finds out he bought the Big Muddy, permanently breaking their engagement. Terrill orders Leech and his men to chase Hannassey's cattle from the Big Muddy, and Hannassey himself kidnaps Julie in retaliation and to lure his rival as bait, and his son Buck does try to rape her before being stopped by his father. McKay finds out about her kidnap, and he has obviously gained feelings for her, he rides with Ramon to get her back, and he does attempt to settle the deed agreement with Hannassey, but he says he still wants to fight Terrill anyway. Buck wants to fight, and his father gets him and McKay to do the formal draw, to which the son fires before the signal, grazing his opponent's head, and after the guns are dropped Hannassey steps in, spitting on his son is disgust. When McKay and rescued Julie start to walk away Buck picks up his gun to shoot them dead, but then his father kills him, and Terrill shows up in the canyon to fight against Hannassey, Leech refusing to join in the confrontation, but he does catch up. The rest of the group follow Leech into the trap in the canyon, but Hannassey and Terrill want a one to one showdown, and it ends with them both killing each other, while McKay, Julie and Ramon ride out together to the open space. Also starring Chuck Hayward as Rafe Hannassey, Buff Brady as Dude Hannassey, Jim Burk as Blackie / Cracker Hannassey and Roddy McDowall as Hannassey Watchman. Peck gives a good suited performance as the gentleman that only gives into fights when necessary, Heston gets just about enough good moments, Simmons has grown up well since Great Expectations and is well casted as well, and I can see why Ives won the Oscar for supporting actor, he is a good mild villain. It is almost three hours long, but it has a good amount of good gun play and horse riding sequences with a sweeping background of desert landscape locations, helped out brilliantly by the fantastic and iconic theme tune, it a most watchable western. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Jerome Moross, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. It was number 71 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",The Big Country
7,rmax304823,Big Movie.,6,4 October 2015,"Gregory Peck is a ship's captain who moves to the Old West to marry his girl friend, Carol Baker, and is swept up in a family feud -- Burl Ives versus Charles Bickford -- over water rights for the cattle.Baker is Bickford's daughter, and Bickford's Stud Duck is Charlton Heston. Peck's arrival immediately generates a strong loathing in Heston, who believes Peck to have one foot in fairydom because he turns down an opportunity to mount an enraged horse and because he claims to have navigated the vast prairie with a compass, while everyone at the ranch believes the newcomer to have been lost. ""The lostest thing I ever saw,"" says Heston.The name of Peck's character is James McKay. Heston is Steve Leech. I ask you, the discerning viewer, which are we to consider the ""good guy"" in this rivalry -- the character named McKay or the character named Leech? Someone wrote a ludicrous scene in which Burl Ives forces his fast-draw son, Chuck Connors, to shoot it out with Peck using a pair of old-fashioned dueling pistols. It ends with the discomfiture of one of the contestants.There are a lot of insults flung around, particularly aimed at masculinity. There is an epic fist fight that observes all the conventions of the Western movie of the 50s -- no blood and no bruises afterward. Curiously, Peck and Heston became good friends and remained so over the years, although Peck was ""a card-carrying member of the ACLU"" and Heston was the poster boy for the National Rifle Association.There is the requisite shoot out at the end. It's dramatic and nicely shot. The ending is sad but peaceful. We must assume that some sort of compromise is going to be reached because both gangs ride off into the sunset together.The photography and location shooting are marvelous. If it's not a vista of endless short-grass prairie, it's milk-white buttes and wadis veined with lavender. Very nicely directed by Anthony Mann. Peck had an argument with him during the shooting and the two didn't speak together for years. I'm inclined to think that the conflict was precipitated by the director. In his memoirs, Charlton Heston refers to Mann as an intransigent wild man.",The Big Country

9,moonspinner55,Devoted friends...dedicated enemies,6,20 November 2010,"Gregory Peck is ideally cast as a peaceable sea captain from the East who comes to Texas in 1886 to claim as his bride the somewhat-spoiled daughter of a rancher; Peck is almost immediately labeled a greenhorn and coward after failing to stand up to a scurrilous brood involved with his prospective in-laws in a fight over rights to a watering hole for cattle. Long-winded western treatise on the definitions of manhood and the prevalence of violence, how it starts and what it ultimately solves. Adapted from a slim novel by Donald Hamilton, William Wyler's film is expansive without being pointed, with an intentionally casual, languorous pace that works against the mounting tensions (bringing attention to the relatively poor editing). The large cast (including Charlton Heston as a cowhand vying for Peck's intended, Carroll Baker, and Burl Ives in an Oscar-winning supporting turn as the patriarch of the Hannassey gang) is solid, though the interior sets are ungainly and the plot is puffed-up with more bluster than it is ultimately worth. **1/2 from ****",The Big Country

""Simply the best film ever made. My number one favorite film."" - President Dwight D. Eisenhower.COMMENT: An epic western directed by William Wyler in an obvious attempt to recapture the success of ""The Westerner"". That the attempt is not wholly successful is due more to the stock characters in the script than to Wyler's somewhat old-hat technique. What makes ""The Big Country"" really outstanding, however, is Jerome Moross's invigorating music score - one of the most exciting ever composed for a motion picture.",The Big Country
11,edwagreen,It's A Big Wonderful Country ****,10,11 February 2006,"""The Big Country"" is a rousing great western with a fabulous all-star cast. As always, Gregory Peck shines in still another film attesting to his social conscientiousness depicted on the screen during his long career.Carol Baker brings her usual sexy ways as the woman who meets Peck in the east and has him come home to the west to wed. It soon appears that Peck was not meant to be a westerner. Naturally, he meets ranch foreman Charlton Heston, a macho guy who is jealous of Baker's love for James (Peck). Still another fine performance by Charles Bickford as her crusty father, who appears to be a fine gentleman but in reality is a bitter person locked in a dispute with a lower class Burl Ives. It is Ives who steals the film in his portrayal. He was awarded the Oscar for best supporting actor and it was well deserved. Jean Simmons is the western school marm, yet we never see her in a classroom setting.Seems that Peck has walked into the beginning of a range war between Bickford and Ives over water rights for cattle.Chuck Connors, who plays Ives' son, sets things in motion by assaulting Peck. Bickford uses this as a pretext to declare ""war"" on the Hennessey's (Ives and his sons.) Things really start to escalate. In the meantime, Peck does prove his masculinity but it is too late for Baker, who has come to believe that he is a coward.The final showdown is obvious but handled very well.Another great asset to the film is the rousing musical score. Its upbeat tempo tells you that you're in for a grand western. It is a big country and wonderful one at that.",The Big Country
12,wes-connors,Wyler Rides the Western Roughshod,8,18 July 2010,"Peace-loving easterner Gregory Peck (as James ""Jim"" McKay) arrives in the western town of San Rafael, to marry adoring blonde Carroll Baker (as Patricia ""Pat"" Terrill). Then, Mr. Peck becomes involved in the feud between the families led by her father Charles Bickford (as Henry Terrill) and rival Burl Ives (as Rufus Hannassey). Peck also meets sexual tension with soft-formed school-teacher Jean Simmons (as Julie Maragon) and sex-seethed, hard-bodied Charlton Heston (as Steve Leech).The direction and photography, by William Wyler and Franz Planer, of this ""anti-western"" opus is truly outstanding, with Mr. Wyler making particular good use of long-shots. Wyler really puts the town and its people in perspective. The music, by Jerome Moross, and performances are also excellent. In hindsight, the characters played by the award-winning Mr. Ives and Mr. Bickford are most noteworthy, but Mr. Heston and Chuck Connors (as Buck) also make especially fine impressions. Ms. Simmons is excellent as always, and Ms. Baker does well as she can with a character pretty much thrown asunder.The film loses something when Peck, looking relatively out-of-shape, gets the obviously muscled-up Heston out of bed for a wrestling match - which Peck seems to win. But, perhaps Peck was a trained fighter as well as an accomplished sea captain. Better played are his match-ups with Mr. Connors, who proves himself a versatile big screen presence just before his television role as ""The Rifleman"" changed everything. ""The Big Country"" could have stood to lose a scene or two, but it's still an excellent film.******** The Big Country (10/1/58) William Wyler ~ Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Burl Ives, Charlton Heston",The Big Country
13,hitchcockthelegend,I'm not going to go on living in the middle of a civil war.,8,12 June 2010,"Retired sea Captain James McKay (Gregory Peck) arrives in the sprawling land of the West to marry fiancée Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker). With an amiable, almost pacifistic approach to life, McKay confounds the ranchers he is now mixing with. Particularly the Terrill ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) who takes an immediate dislike to him. Not only that but it seems that James has landed right in the middle of a family rivalry between the Terrill's and the Hannassey's: just as it's about to fully ignite into war. Directed by William Wyler (Ben-Hur/Mrs. Miniver), The Big Country is adapted from a short story called Ambush at Blanco Canyon that was written by Donald Hamilton. Beautifully photographed by Franz Planer on location at the Red Rock Canyon in Mojave, California and at the three-thousand acre Drais ranch in Stockton, the film is epic in many ways. Though the story, with its twin themes of violence begets violence and you don't have to act tough to be tough, is a thin one, it's given such an operatic make over by Wyler that it's not hard to be swept away by it all. Helped enormously by the afore mentioned Planer, music composer Jerome Moross, and an impressive and on form cast (Heston in superb tough guy mode and Burl Ives delivering a Oscar winning performance as head Hannassey patriarch Rufus), it's a big production in many ways. Overall, The Big Country sees a small story made big as it's told in an astutely classic style. With memorable acting, gorgeous scenery, big music and notable moments of action (a fist fight between Peck & Heston alone is epic and apparently took three days to get right) it's a must see for the Western enthusiast. 8/10",The Big Country
14,Doylenf,"""The Big Country"" is the grand-daddy of overblown westerns...",7,6 February 2007,"GREGORY PECK's innate ability to play a man of integrity is never better utilized than it is by director William Wyler for THE BIG COUNTRY. In fact, Wyler is able to draw expert performances from all of the male leads, who really do exceptional work here. It's the men who dominate the film and Wyler gives them all a chance to show what they can do. The film itself is a bit overblown, even for an epic western.As the most villainous of BURL IVES' sons, CHUCK CONNORS stands out in a very aggressive role as the gang of four who welcome Peck to ""the big country"" by taunting him with reckless energy as they lasso him, tear his hat off, shoot at it, keeping his fiancé, CARROLL BAKER in check to witness their humiliating tactics. But Peck is a gentleman from the east, a Sea Captain returning to the west to marry the woman he thinks he loves and his way of dealing with bullies upsets his fiancé who fails to understand his values and always underestimates him.As it turns out, JEAN SIMMONS becomes the real woman for him--and after many a plot turn he ends up rescuing her from a fate worse than death after she's captured by Ives and his unruly, cowardly son Connors.It's a complex story of an age old feud over water rights that involves, principally, Ives and CHARLES BICKFORD as the headstrong men who are unable to settle a score peacefully even when Peck tries to intervene. It's an epic tale, sprawling and a bit rambling over the course of two hours and forty-five minutes, but Wyler holds it all together for maximum interest, aided and abetted by a wonderful western score by Jerome Moross that has become classic.Peck never had a role that suited him so admirably and CHARLTON HESTON is excellent as Bickford's right hand man with unwanted designs on Carroll Baker. His fist fight with Peck is a classic of its kind. And ALFONSO BEDOYA (tbe grinning bandit from TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE)as Ramon, the sometimes dull-witted hired help with his halting English, is excellent.Summing up: A sturdy but overblown western with a classic score, full of strong performances by an expert cast.",The Big Country
15,LeonLouisRicci,Magnificently Mounted with a Meaningful Message,7,20 March 2013,"Critics may have called it right. It is an impressive, big Movie from the 1950""s and there were so many Westerns of different worth made in that decade that sometimes it is better to see it apart from its time frame. Where the critics got it mostly right is that this is not a great Western.It is very good, finely produced, glossy, and left to bake in the sun just a little too long. The always talked about musical score is loud and overwhelming at times and screams out for attention. It is as if the landscapes and production are so ""BIG"" that the Music tries way too hard to be heard and sometimes its too fanciful and frothy.There are some powerful elements to this production. A great and impeccably placed cast. Chuck Connors, Burl Ives, and Charlton Heston all are excellent in this one and Gregory Peck is at his best. This is an anti-violence Western and it makes it point and continues to make its point for over two and one half hours. The beautiful landscape notwithstanding, this could have been much better much shorter. The ending also seems out of place once they get to the lackluster shootout in the canyon and it seems rushed, just the opposite of everything else that went before that could be called laborious.",The Big Country

Add to the mix, quite a bit of rivalry from Charlton Heston (""Leech"") who is the Major's right hand man, and a man who has designs on ""Pat"" and finally Jean Simmons who own the ""Old Muddy"" - the river that both are essentially fighting over and we've got a great recipe for a top class action adventure. It has the greatest of cinematography, a score that you instantly recognise and performances - especially, I felt, from Ives that really do resonate - they engender a sense of just how tough, uncompromising and beautiful life for these pioneers must have been. Also how civilised it could be with men of honour and principle prepared to stand their ground - however misplaced that might have been.

17,writers_reign,The Big Yawn,5,15 September 2015,"The law of averages makes it inevitable than any major performer, whether vocalist (Sinatra) or actor (Michael Caine) if sufficiently prolific will turn in a percentage of dross. Ironically Gregory Peck, one of the finest and most underrated of major actors, turned out two of the most disappointing big-budget, all-star cast, 'westerns' in a tad over a decade, Duel In The Sun and this one, The Big Country. Though far and away the best thing in it Peck is hamstrung by the essential dullness of the story and pedestrian directing of William Wyler (who, together with Peck and Audrey Hepburn) had hit one out of the park only five years earlier with Roman Holiday. It's just hard to work up a sweat about Peck's non- conformist secure-in-his-own-skin role when the best 'all-male' opposition they can come up with for him to clash with giant Redwood Charlton Heston flaunting his Forestry Commission training in every scene and strewing the set with sawdust.

19,zardoz-13,A Landmark East Meets West Horse Opera,8,29 December 2018,"""Roman Holiday"" director William Wyler's sprawling, high-budget, cattle empire western ""The Big Country"" more than lives up to the ""Big"" in its title. Everything about this epic United Artists release as well as everybody in it qualifies as ""BIG."" Leading man & producer Gregory Peck takes top-billing as a man from the East, James McKay, who finds himself in this violence-prone, rawhide culture. Moreover, he is skewered as a figure of ridicule among westerners. Unfortunately, he finds himself up in the middle of a deadly feud between two cattlemen. The affluent Major Henry Terrill owns a large, opulent ranch, with an antebellum mansion, while Rufus Hannassey's spread looks comparatively penny thrift. McKay exemplifies the stereotype of a tenderfoot, an individual not calculated to long survive the adversity of the frontier. He has ventured west to wed a cattle baron's beautiful daughter. Patricia Terrill (Carol Baker of ""Baby Doll"") met the handsome sea captain in the east, and they fell in love. Now, out west, on Patricia's father's huge ranch, he meets her intractable father, Major Henry Terrill (a stern-looking Charles Bickford) and his brawny foreman, Steve Leech (Charlton Heston of ""Pony Express""), along with various other people. Behind the camera, three-time Oscar-Winning director William Wyler called the shots. Best known for the Gary Cooper oater ""The Westerner"" (1940), Wyler was no stranger to the genre, having helmed many silent western shorts, such as ""Don't Shoot"" (1926), ""Riding for Love"" (1926), ""Straight Shootin'"" (1927). According to the eminent critic Sir Christopher Frayling, Wyler and Peck has been looking forward to teaming up again after their success with ""Roman Holiday,"" but they clashed throughout the film and then uttered not a word to each other for four years afterward!
McKay endures derision since he refuses to let convention to dictate his response to the adolescent antics of his adversaries at both the Terrill and Hannassey ranches. Initially, Leech wants to humiliate McKay by challenging him to ride a fearsome horse. McKay rejects the challenge. Later, secretly, he manages to dominate the notorious bucking bronc 'Ole Thunder.' Leech challenges McKay to a fight, but he refuses to accommodate him. Now, the Terrills suspect that McKay is a yellow-livered coward. Similarly, he did nothing earlier when Buck Hannassey (Chuck Connors, later of ""The Rifleman"") humiliated him in front Patricia and he as they were riding out to Terrill ranch. The indignities perpetrated on Patricia and McKay prompts an angry Major Terrill to assemble a raiding party and ride out to confront Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives of ""Across the Everglades"") at his ranch near Blanco Canyon. Hannassey is away on business, so Terrill and his men leave their calling cards as they rampage around the ranch and the cowboys turn the wooden water tank in a sieve, blasting innumerable holes into it with streams of water gushing out. Before they rode out to the ranch, they scoured the surrounding countryside for Buck and his buddies. They found the buddies and beat the stuffing out of them, but low-down, dirty Buck hid in a wagon while his pals were beaten up. Mind you, we never learn the basis of the long-running feud between Terrill and Hannassey, except that neither can tolerate the other, and they have been struggling over the years to buy the ranch that lies between them, so each can dominate the river that flows through it. The owner of this ranch, Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons of ""Rough Night in Jericho"") refuses staunchly to sell her property to either the Terrills or the Hannasseys.Clocking in at an inflated 2 hours and 46 minutes, this pretentious horse opera is still mandatory for all serious western movie aficionados. Seasoned western filmgoers may find the Gregory Peck hero sympathetic, but he generates minimal charisma despite the duel with Buck and the slugfest with Leech. Basically, the McKay hero is non-traditional and prone to passivity, compared with the act, traditional western hero. The hero's dramatic gravitas is what undermines ""The Big Country."" Clearly, this intelligent but violent western sought to alter the formula, but it fails, leaving us with a hero is remains an outsider, somebody who never belonged there in the first place. Meantime, Peck is sterling as McKay, but he is not the six-gun packing hombre that most westerns feature.Overall, ""The Big Country"" amounts to a metaphor for the 1960s Cold War. Terrill represents traditional American democracy, while the Hannasseys resemble the Soviets. Corpulent Burl Ives, who clinched a Best Supporting Oscar as Rufus, lords it over the Hannasseys, and his rotund appearance matches the late Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Rufus' dramatic entrance at the Terrill ranch during the party is staggering. He upstages the Major in the latter's own turf. Rufus resembles a traditional western villain. Nevertheless, Major Terrill is no different. By the way, Bickford is excellent; he looks like he belongs to the regal ranch setting. We're never told what precipitated their life & death feud, but they pursue it with a vengeance. The melodrama in ""The Big Country"" grows out of Buck Hannassey's childish pranks. The rival cattle titans and their feud set the stage for the conflict, but it is the romance that ignites the powder keg. Wyler offsets McKay's romance, with Buck Hannassey's romance with a reluctant Julie. This disastrous romance leads up to the finale and the Major's demise. Buck holds Julie hostage, and Rufus challenges the Major to attack him again. The back and forth conflicts between Major Terrill and Hannassey swung initially in the Major's favor, but now they swing in Rufus' favor. Rufus controls everything, with the Major and Steve Leach trapped in the pass like fish in a barrel.The performances are terrific as the production values stunning. Jerome Moross' majestically exuberant orchestral score ranks as one of the greatest western scores ever, equaled only by Elmer Bernstein's ""The Magnificent Seven."" Flawed masterpiece that it is, ""The Big Country"" has enough of everything to compensate for its excessive length.",The Big Country

Gregory Peck's character is overly goody- two-shoesy and the movie does feel quite sappy from time to time. Incredibly long too, at nearly three hours.

He attaches no importance to the fact that he is perceived as a coward, and the wonderful scene where we discover that he is far from cowardly involves a fist fight with Charlton Heston which takes place secretly at night (so that no one else knows), and filmed from a long way away - the struggle of these two men is reduced to insignificance as we see the two tiny figures battling in the middle of a seemingly limitless empty plain.That is not to disparage the rest of the case, all of whom perform flawlessly.

22,evanston_dad,Big Westerns Don't Get Much Better Than This,10,12 September 2006,"""The Big Country"" is not a movie that held much appeal for me before I'd seen it. I only rented it because a guy I worked with said this was his favorite movie -- given the fact that he's about as conservative as it's physically possible to be, I had my doubts. But I owe him a huge debt of gratitude for introducing me to this magnificent film.Director William Wyler breaks from the women-focused domestic dramas that made him famous throughout the 1940s and heads out west to tackle cowboys, ranchers and the women who love them. And what a picture he paints! Everything about this movie feels grand, but not in that lumbering, stodgy way that CinemaScope epics from the 1950s so often did. Crisp editing and compelling performances propel this story along fluidly, as does a glorious score that's perfectly utilized. I've never liked Charlton Heston better than I do here (except for ""Planet of the Apes,"" but that's more to make fun of him), and Burl Ives anchors the film with his rich baritone and imposing size -- he's a force of nature in this film, and his impressive performance here is only one of two he delivered in 1958 (""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" being the other one).Highlights of ""The Big Country"" include a fistfight between Gregory Peck and Heston that each refuses to quit and a breathtakingly suspenseful final showdown in a canyon between Ives and arch rival Charles Bickford set to more of that pulsing, vibrant musical score.A treasure from an on-again-off-again decade.Grade: A+",The Big Country
23,HotToastyRag,Fantastic western classic,7,23 July 2017,"I haven't seen every western in the world, but I've seen my fair share, and in my opinion The Big Country is one of the best classic western films. If you haven't seen this oldie yet, go out and buy it now. Trust me, you'll want to watch it over and over again.William Wyler, director of another perfect American classic The Best Years of Our Lives, helmed The Big Country the year before using Charlton Heston again in Ben-Hur. Charlton Heston plays the antagonist in this movie, and it's great to see him in that rare role. The lead, the out-of-towner with a strong moral character, is played by Gregory Peck, the very portrait of American integrity. Greg comes to the open country to reunite with his fiancé Caroll Baker. He's an outsider, and he isn't welcomed with open arms by everyone. Along the way, he builds a friendship with Jean Simmons, who appreciates his high morals, and he finds himself in the middle of a decades-old family feud, led by Charles Bickford and Burl Ives.Jerome Moross wrote one of the greatest film scores of all time to The Big Country, but of course, lost the Oscar that year to a far less deserving rival. It's such a beautiful score, romantic, equestrian, and adventurous in all the right places.Every wonderful element that makes a classic western is found in The Big Country. There's a slow but steady pace set by a gentle director, grizzled old men with memorable one-liners in their bickering, a clash between country folk and city folk, love triangles, an untamable horse, a shootout, and beautiful music.",The Big Country
24,Wuchakk,One of the Great Westerns,9,16 June 2013,"""The Big Country"" is an epic Western from 1958. It tells the story of New Englander James McKay (Gregory Peck), who goes out West to meet up with his fiancé, Patricia (Caroll Baker), on her father's huge ranch. McKay stirs up rivalry in the stud foreman of the ranch, Leech (Charleton Heston), and finds himself in the middle of a feud over water rights.Also on hand are Charles Bickford as Patricia's father, Major Terrill, Burl Ives as the patriarch of the Hannessey clan and Chuck Conners as his brutish son.Shot in remote areas of California and running 2 hours and 46 minutes, ""The Big Country"" is engrossing from beginning to end. As with all great films, it has excellent character development. These people seem real. They have good points and bad. For instance, Patricia and her father are introduced as protagonists, but we slowly discover that they're selfish and immature in some ways. Rufus Hannessey starts out as somewhat of a villain but the viewer can't help but respect him as the story unfolds. Conners is excellent as the loathsome Buck Hannessey and Jean Simmons is perfect as the angelic owner of the watering hole.I like how McKay refuses to take Leech's bait and handles him on his own terms. Also his refusal to try to prove his manhood to anyone other than himself. Despite his conditional pacifism (which is different than absolute pacifism), McKay proves he's ten times the man Major Terrill is. Note how he treats the Hispanic stableman and his family with respect and appreciation while Terrill speaks down to them like they're his slaves.It's inexplicable why ""The Big Country"" isn't normally cited with the best Westerns. It definitely ranks with my favorite Westerns.GRADE: A",The Big Country

26,JamesHitchcock,A Classic Western,9,1 March 2005,"When James McKay, a former sea-captain and the son of a wealthy Eastern ship-owning family, gets engaged to Patricia Terrell, a rancher's daughter, and moves out West to meet her family, he finds himself in the middle of a violent feud. Patricia's father, Major Henry Terrell, is the biggest landowner in the area and appears at first sight to be a man of culture and breeding, living a life of luxury and elegance in an elegant mansion. Beneath his urbane exterior, however, Major Terrell is a man of strong passions, and has conceived a violent dislike for the Hannasseys, a neighbouring family. Exactly how the feud started is not clear, but an important factor in the Major's dislike seems to be that he regards the Hannasseys, whom he refers to as ""local trash"", as his social inferiors.Shortly after his arrival, McKay is subjected to some rough-housing by three of the Hanassey clan. The incident was motivated more by drunken bravado than by any malicious intent, and McKay, who is a peaceable man by nature, does not want to retaliate. Terrell, however, is outraged by the insult offered to his prospective son-in-law, and takes the opportunity to teach the Hanasseys a lesson by organising an armed raid on their ranch. The feud worsens, and McKay's attempts to keep the peace are unsuccessful. By advocating a policy of turning the other cheek, McKay alienates the Major, and makes an open enemy of his foreman, Steve Leech, both of whom regard pacifism as dishonourable and cowardly. Worse still, McKay becomes estranged from Patricia herself, who shares her father's view that a man should fight in order to defend his honour.The feud comes to a head over the Big Muddy. Whoever owns this piece of land, will control access to the river, vitally important for watering cattle in this arid landscape. The land is currently owned by Julie Maragon, the local schoolmistress and the last descendant of a once-powerful family. Julie, who shares McKay's peaceable nature, is happy to allow both families to water their cattle, but Terrill and Rufus, the patriarch of the Hannassey clan, both covet the land in order to prevent their enemies from watering their cattle. McKay himself also wants the land, as he is thinking of becoming a rancher in his own right. The film's violent, but emotionally powerful, climax comes after a group of Terrills drive some of the Hannassey's cattle away from the water and the Hannasseys, in retaliation, kidnap Julie in an attempt to force her to sell the land.""The Big Country"" is a good example of the new type of Western that was becoming popular in the 1950s, making good use of the spectacular scenery of the West and concentrating as much upon character development as upon action. Like most of the great Westerns (""High Noon"", ""The Naked Spur"", ""Lawman"", ""The Shootist"" and ""Unforgiven"" are all examples), it is not just an adventure story but also an exploration of moral issues. It can perhaps be seen as an early example of a revisionist Western in that it calls into question the code of honour and revenge that governed the West. The characters can be arranged in a moral spectrum according to their values. At one end of the spectrum are McKay and Julie, both of whom reject the idea that violence in defence of one's honour or in pursuit of revenge is morally justified. It is noteworthy that neither was born into the dominant Anglophone culture of the West; McKay is from the East, whereas Julie's family are of Mexican origin.At the other moral extreme is Rufus's son Buck, a vicious and cowardly thug. Terrill, Pat, Leech, and Rufus himself come somewhere in the middle. Terrill is not as bad as Buck (he is not, for example, a physical coward), but for all his gentlemanly pretensions he is capable of most ungentlemanly behaviour. His code is one of upholding his honour at all costs and of seeking to avenge all injuries done to him, often exacting a revenge quite disproportionate to the original offence. The great tragedy is that he has passed his false system of values on to the next generation in the shape of his daughter. Leech is loyal to his employer, whose values he largely shares, but is pragmatic enough to appreciate that there are times when violence can be counter-productive. Rufus is a rough diamond, with none of Terrill's social airs and graces, but retains a certain sense of right and wrong lacking in his neighbour. There is a sense that Rufus has at times been reluctantly pushed into violence by Terrill's campaign against him.All the main actors are superb. Burl Ives well deserved his Best Supporting Actor award for his performance as Rufus, and McKay is a typical example of the intelligent, thoughtful man of integrity that Gregory Peck excelled at portraying. They are well supported by Charles Bickford, Charlton Heston (cast against type as the largely unsympathetic Leech), Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker. With some magnificent shots of the Western scenery, and one of the finest of all Western musical scores, this film is a true classic. In my view this was the Best Picture of 1958; unfortunately the Academy preferred the frothy trivia of ""Gigi"". 9/10",The Big Country

28,theowinthrop,"A Big Country, A Big Western, and Big Burl's Oscar",10,9 February 2006,"THE BIG COUNTRY fits two types of movies that were big in the 1950s: One was the modern western (a western where the characters behaved with modern sensibilities), and the other was the huge blockbuster movies made to attract the audience being lost to early television (ironically, mostly to westerns as programs). Directed by William Wyler, he takes a leaf from John Ford's movies, such as the ""cavalry trilogy"" and THE SEARCHERS, to let the audience see for themselves the immensity of the American west (more properly the southwest). In fact, a kind of mild running gag in the film is how when Gregory Peck arrives everyone from his future father-in-law Charles Bickford, and his fiancé Carol Baker, and even Charlton Heston mentions that it is a big country (and that he can get lost in it). At the party thrown by Bickford, one of the guests asks Peck if he's ever been impressed by anything larger than the country. Peck says he has. He was a sea captain, and he's seen the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans! Ironically, at one point, he is believed lost and scouting parties are sent for him. He is never lost - he had a map and a compass all the time!Peck seems an eastern ""dude"" out of water when he arrives with his derby style hat (exciting the hoots of laughter from Chuck Connors and his men (the ""Hannasey"" white trash)). Actually he is simply not a man to demonstrate his emotions as readily as Bickford, Heston, Connors, or Burl Ives. They are always ready to defend their honor - as Bickford points out they are two hundred miles from the closest government seat, so they have to be their own policemen. But Peck keeps confounding them all. He conquers the horse that throws all the strangers - but he does it quietly when only Alfonso Bedoya is around to help. He won't stand up against Connors, whom he considers a drunken bully. He won't publicly fight Heston when the latter calls him a liar. But when alone they fight to a draw, and Heston realizes Peck is not a weakling or coward.Peck also sees the tensions in the country as due to the antagonisms of two men: Bickford's Major Henry Terrill and Ives' Rufus Hannassay. It is a clash of class (on the surface), although Peck eventually says it is a confrontation between two selfish old men. He tries to find a happy medium out of the mess by buying Jean Simmons' land, but that is not as successful an idea as he hoped. Peck, somewhat simplistically, thinks that by promising open watering rights to everyone he is settling the main issue. But the hatred is too strong.All the characters are well drawn. Baker, at first a loving girlfriend, turns out to be too deeply committed to her father's point of view on everything. Simmons, who owns the coveted watering area, ""the big muddy"", thinks in a similar way to Peck, but she underestimates her being a woman alone in a range war. Connors is determined to bully and grab what he can from everyone, but he doesn't fool his father (whom considers him a great disappointment), and can't prevent the world from seeing he's a coward. Heston is loyal to Bickford (who picked him out of the dust literally) but he does have as sense of right and wrong, and a sense of shame, that causes a break in their relationship in the end. Bedoya proves to be loyal to Peck, and the only one to accompany him on his last mission in the film. Bickford has striven to appear classy and a defender of ""Christian values"", but he is a ruthless cattle baron for all that who sees the silly attack on Peck as a ""comment"" on himself by his enemy Ives (who knew nothing about it).But Ives is wonderful - and deserved his Oscar. His best remembered performance (of course) will always be ""Big Daddy"" in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF - one of the best written roles in modern American theater. Rufus Hannassy is white trash (note his advise of taking an occasional bath when dating a woman). But in comparison to the more hypocritical Bickford/Terrill, he does not push his men to confront anyone, nor does he get uptight about trivialities. He confronts Terrill at the latter's home during a party after Terrill had led his own men to raid Ives' ranch and destroy his water tower. He does understand what Terrill would never understand: a real gentleman is a good neighbor and a man of his word (two things Terrill can barely be). And finally there is the involved issue of Ives' relationship with his son Connors. Ives' has a sense of morality, and he beats up Connors when the latter tries to commit rape. Up to their last moments on screen together Connors is consistently disappointing him. It is only after the latter's death that Ives' comes to his senses, and agrees with Peck as to what he must do to stop the range war from continuing. Of the two selfish old men, Ives keeps the audience's sympathy.",The Big Country
29,Lejink,Plain big,7,23 July 2010,"Delivers what it says on the tin, as they say, an epic western set in the great outdoors, where mere mortals play out their lives like gnats against the massive backdrop of the west. Propelled by the wonderful familiar theme music, itself big enough to almost assume character status, there's nothing modest about the director's aims here.The fifties of course were a time when the running time of big-budget Hollywood movie subjects ran and ran and ran - Wyler was to take this to some sort of apotheosis with ""Ben Hur"" and one of the supporting actors here, Charlton Heston, as his lead, the next year. However the latter had the playground of those monumentally-constructed recreation Roman sets and a less contrived storyline than ""The Big Country"" to its advantage - glorious as the natural landscapes are in the latter, they can't carry the whole movie. Of course it needs a convincing story and top acting to achieve viewing satisfaction and while both these areas are well served, ultimately it falls short of true greatness, in my opinion.To fill its length, we're given a sub-Shakepearian motif of feuding families headed by intractable father figures in the personas of Charles Bickford and Burl Ives. There must have been something about America in the fifties with so many prominent feature films concerning the dynastic struggles between warring family members. Both actors by the way are fine but the conclusion where they annihilate each other is overblown to say the least. Gregory Peck is assured and commanding as the lightning rod around which passions seem to become enflamed, with Jean Simmons not far behind as the heiress teacher over whose land Bickford and Ives contest. There are sub-plots too with Heston's near-adoration of his stubborn old coot of an employer the Major and his suppressed desire for Peck's original intended, the Major's daughter, played by Carroll Baker.This is contrasted with Ives own errant eldest son (played by Chuck Connors) and his infatuation with Simmons, which predictably ends in death and tragedy before the closing titles.For me there was too much plot for the film and I found I enjoyed the movie more when appreciating the high quality camera work, musical score or acting. Almost all of the acting is good, with Peck shining as only he can as the grace-under-pressure Jim McKay, who upholds his own principles of ethical behaviour in the face of overbearing peer pressure from his in-laws-to-be. Wyler's cinematography under a blazing sun is excellent, some of the fight scenes seeing the protagonists reduced to the size of ants against the monolithic rocky tableau behind them.On the whole then, a mighty long, mighty big but still mighty enjoyable western, a feast for the eyes and ears.",The Big Country
30,ElMaruecan82,"Is ""The Big Country"" superior to a Ford classic? Maybe not, but it's different.",8,30 September 2019,"""The Big Country"", the title alone evokes an epic high-scaled Western with breathtaking panoramic shots, Gregory Peck's portrayal of a civilized Eastern dude who refuses violence makes us expect a 180° turn at some point of the film but if anything, this is a William Wyler's drama whose overarching idea is that no one or nothing is what he or she seems. In fact, the film's statement about gentleman's codes is the antithesis of John Wayne's Fordian posture, its insistence that the country is big plays more like an overlong running gag and its ode to peace is an odd addition to a genre where most conflicts are solved through the use of violence.And Gregory Peck embodies all these contradictions in once. AsJim McKay, the Eastern dude who comes to the 'big country' to marry Patricia (Carrol Baker), daughter of a rich rancher Major Terrill (Charles Bickford). At first, McKay strikes like your typical tenderfoot, wearing civilized clothes and an incongruous hat for eyes used to the good old Stetson. His appearance provokes the hilarity of the locals and an instant dislike from Terrill's ranch foreman Steve Leech, played by Charlton Heston. And so we have polar opposites in the two men: an old-fashioned cowboy who knows the ropes and a New Englander oblivious to the codes of masculinity.The gap deepens when they meet the fiancée Patricia, she's happy to see her sea Captain back but from Leech's face, we get the vibes of a romantic rivalry not deprived of sexual tension. But that's not what Wyler intends for us. Shortly after, McKay and Patricia meet her friend Julie Marigon (Jean Simmons) who's the schoolmarm and owner of a patch of land named Big Muddy. Her absence while they kiss makes McKay comment ""I think I like this girl"", it's for little touches like that that this film should be watched twice.En route to the ranch, McKay is harassed by the Hanassey brothers, lead by Buck, played by Chuck Connors. They go for a series of incredible stunts that amuse McKay but not Patricia, the whole carriage-chasing seems to anticipate a certain chariot race in a certain Wyler's film made the following year but that's one of the few moments where the film indulges to showiness. McKay stops the carriage and prevents Patricia from shooting, I thought it's not often in a Western that we see a woman being trigger-happy and the man the voice of reason but Wyler had always for women more than damsels in distress or weeping wives' roles.Anyway, the incident creates the first breech in the marriage edifice and it all goes all downhill after many episodes making McKay look like a coward. To be fair, it insists a bit too much on it, we get it he's a man who doesn't need to prove himself. He resists all the provocations from Leech, never tries to give Patricia satisfaction and go as far as hurting the locals' pride about their 'big country' by mentioning how bigger the oceans were, but that's what it's all about: changing your perspective. Which Wyler does when he leaves McKay in the ranch while we see the punitive expedition lead by Terrill's men at Hannassey's White Canyon farm, and their not so chivalrous methods.The next day, McKay visits the Big Muddy and understands the place it occupies in the feud between the two clans, a matter of watering the cattle where Terrill wouldn't hesitate one second to let Hanassey's cattle die of thirst if he owned the land. The first act closes when Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives) interrupts a celebration at Terrill's house to give him an unforgettable ""Reason You Suck"" monologue... and McKay starts looking at 'Daddy' differently, he might look more gentlemanly, less crude and untidy than Rufus, but if anyone should not judge a book by its cover, it's him.Burl Ives won an Oscar for his role and I knew his performance could only be superlative if it had to be that nomination over his unforgettable Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". Rufus is a man as capable as Terrill for hatred and violence but he's got a certain instinct to spot the decency in McKay. What's interesting in the film is that it's mostly an area of gray morality where the only decent people are McKay, Julie and the dim-witted Ramon, Alfonso ""Badges"" Bedaya in his final role. And so once we see McKay as a man of integrity who doesn't despise violence but its use to prove a man's worth, it becomes clearer that Patricia isn't the woman he needs; spoiled and self-centered and as Julie asks her ""how many times does he have to win you"".McKay isn't exactly a peacemaker or the conscience objector Gary Cooper was in ""Friendly Persuasion"" but a man who acts according to his own rules. And as a behind-the-camera counterpart, Wyler becomes the McKay of directors. The long fist-fight between Peck and Heston is shot from a long range, without sound or close-ups as to make the place bigger, the men smaller, the fight less spectacular, less Fordian, accentuating its pointlessness when at the end both are exhausted and McKay says ""what did we prove?"". And maybe that's the talent of Wyler that he doesn't need to imitate Ford to prove he can direct Western movies.Of course, he can't totally reject all the tropes, for all his pretensions to make something new, we still have the typical triumphant scoring popping here and there (sometimes during incongruous moments) and the stance about keeping everything under control is such an overarching theme that I was disappointed during some stereotyped shootouts, or maybe it's the irony of non-violence, you can't highlight the need for peace without showing the effects of blind violence.Still, ""The Big Country"" is as satisfying as a conventional than a different Western.",The Big Country
31,poe426,Charlton Heston's nuanced performance...,10,14 June 2014,"I've always liked Gregory Peck, and I think he's great here, but it's Charlton Heston's nuanced performance that prompts these comments. I've stated elsewhere (in my comments for TREASURE ISLAND, for instance) that Charlton Heston was more than capable of playing a believable Bad Guy and that he could've made a career out of doing just that had he so chosen; and one of his finest turns came in THE BIG COUNTRY. Shakespearean in scope, THE BIG COUNTRY features Heston as the ranch foreman Steve Leech. It's a nuanced performance, with Leech at first coming off as little more than a hard-driving b****** with a thing for the woman who would become Peck's girl- but the character goes through a very dramatic change that showcases Heston's range: the ""Bad"" Guy morphs into a Not So Bad Guy After All. The times Heston impresses on screen are about as numerous as the films he starred in (or even co-starred in, or had what amounted to a bit part in). The man was a consummate professional and it's always a pleasure to watch him work. There'll never be another like him.",The Big Country
32,weezeralfalfa,Yankee gentleman former sea captain tries to tame the Wild West.,8,7 October 2015,"There have been many fine reviews of this film already. Thus, I will mostly confine my remarks to one of the themes of the film: the incompatibilities that most contributed to the breakup of marriage plans between ex- Yankee sea captain Jim McKay(Gregory Peck) and his fiancée Pat Terrill(Carroll Baker), daughter of a cattle baron in the West. But, first, I would like to point out that, although not hinted in the film, the feud between the Hannasseys and Terrills was likely rooted in ethnic and religious bigotry. Hannassey is an Irish name, and the Terrills were most likely of English ancestry. This fits the general peception of the times of Irish immigrants as uncouth ruffians. Also, I should mention that Peck was very reluctant to be under the direction of the perfectionist William Wyler, whom he had worked with in ""Roman Holidays"", who was infamous for the many 'takes' he required.Clearly, the middle-aged Jim and young Pat didn't know each other very well before Jim made the life-changing decision to retire from his nautical career to begin life as a rancher. Pat soon figured out that Jim was determined to quickly become his own man in this 'big country', not just her father's puppet. Strike one against him. She also discovered that Jim was too aloof to the rough and tumble western ranch culture for her liking. Not only did he show minimal hostility toward the rough hazing reception by the Hannassey 'boys', he refused to cooperate with the baiting challenges of riding a notoriously untamable horse, or brawling with ranch hand Steve(Carleton Heston), who also had the hots for Pat. The latter 2 challenges he eventually met, but only when there was no crowd to make him a spectacle, win or lose. Unlike some reviewers, I don't see Jim's aloofness regarding these challenges as necessarily a sign of superior nobleness. Rather they seem prudent responses. Also, he was much influenced by his father's death in a dual over which, in retrospect, was a rather trivial matter. It was prudent not to show great fear nor anger when faced with a gang of ruffians in an unfamiliar territory and culture. It was prudent not to risk making a fool of himself and risking serious injury before a crowd, including his fiancé, in trying to ride a horse hinted at as being very wild. It was prudent to decline engaging in a fist fight, with possible serious injury, over the seemingly trivial question of whether he had become lost in his solo survey of the ranch. But later, when learning of the kidnapping of his new love, Julie(Jean Simmons), by the Hannasseys, he ignored prudence and played the role of potential hero or dead man. The lines between courage and foolhardiness, and between cowardice and prudence will often be blurred.Various reviewers have made the point that a fundamental difference between Jim and Pat was that Jim believed that what he was really like and had accomplished was more important, whereas Pat believed how others saw you was more important than what you were really like. The film biases our opinion to see Jim's ethos as the better of the two, but remember that Peck was a coproducer of the film. As I see it, in the real world, both are important. Reputation often makes the difference between success and failure in the business world, whether based on fact or fiction. However, Pat should have understood that Jim had prudent reasons, consistent with his aloof personality, for responding to the several baiting challenges he was faced with, as he did. After all, as an ex-sea captain, Jim was used to exhibiting a degree of aloofness. Interestingly, when it came to sharing water rights that he now technically owned, something critical to all his neighbors, Jim was not aloof, declaring all neighboring parties had equal access to his water, as they had, some years ago, under Julie's father. Julie, as a non-cattlewoman heir to her father's land, had been too weak, and too connected with the Terrills to fully enforce the tradition of equal water access. Hopefully, now in league with Jim, and presumably now disconnected with the Terrills as well as the Hennasseys, the pair would be strong enough to enforce their critical rule.",The Big Country

It's the story of an Eastern sea Captain James McKay (Gregory Peck) who's decided to leave his ship's travels behind, take a Western wife and move West to meet her wealthy father. Arriving, McKay admires the grand scope and scenery of the open West, but is unimpressed with its size. To western observers, he is treated with indifference and his quiet peaceful demeanor is seen as lacking in manhood. One individual laughingly taunts him with the West's immense grandeur with 'Did you ever see anything so big? Yes, answers McKay, two Oceans.' From then on its a test of wills between East and West. There amid the vast open range lies the great plains ranch called 'Ladder' with it's rough, tough square-jaw Foreman named Steve Leech (Charlton Heston). Its Leech who doesn't believe McKay is much of a man and challenges the Captain again and again, only to be denied. Charles Bickford plays Maj. Henry Terrill a self-proclaimed gentleman who's twenty year old feud with his one time rival Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives) and his son Buck (Chuck Connors) aim to settle their quarrel with guns. In addition, both powerful men struggle to obtain the major source of water in the region called "" Big Muddy "" which is owned by Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons). Her friend, Patricia (Carroll Baker) is the daughter of Henry Terrill and is as bigoted and blind as her father. With a supporting cast which includes Alfonso Bedoya as Ramón Guiteras, the film is filled with Grand scenes, majestic landscapes and western action. The story is straight forward and definitely a must for anyone who likes a good old fashion Cowboy movie. All in all, nothing short of a grand Classic.

His affianced Patricia Terrill makes the mistake of taking his patrician reluctance to fight for an inability to do so and accuses him of cowardice,an opinion shared by her father Major Terrill( Mr C.Bickford) and his foreman(Mr C.Heston). During the course of ""The Big Country"" they all have cause to regret their rush to judgement. Major Terrill whilst displaying the outward signs of a benign patriarchal figure is in fact a ruthless bully engaged in an endless series of confrontations with neighbouring 19th century trailer trash family the Hannasseys led by the very great Mr Burl Ives,a man who has no illusions about anybody,not even himself. He hates Terrill not only for his intransigence but also for his pretensions.The Major is bent on denying the Hannasseys' cattle access to the only water for hundreds of miles,the so - called ""Big Muddy"",owned by Miss J.Simmons,friend and confidante of his daughter. Mr Peck proposes to buy the ""Big Muddy"" as a wedding present for his fiancée,but as her ardour cools he decides to put down roots,buy the water for himself and allow both the Terrills and the Hannaseys access to it.But he hasn't counted on the bloody - minded hatred that exists between the two men. ""The Big Country - not much critically fancied in it's day - may well be one of the best westerns of the golden era,offering as it does an alternative view from the Hawks/Ford axis of what it actually takes to be a man.

36,CubsandCulture,Another Wyler success but it shows why his stock has gone down over the years,8,7 June 2021,"Wyler during his life was one of the most successful directors-IIRC he has directed the most Oscar nominated performances, made 3 Best Pictures and won Best director 3 times. He was often given the largest budgets and the most prestigious films to work on. Wyler has good eye and a real knack for getting compelling performances. Heston-for example-turned in his two best performances in Wyler films; in this film and in Ben-Hur (1959). But Wyler's reputation has gone down because the man wasn't an auteur-his film's lack the distinctness of say Altman, Spielberg or QT. Instead his film are usually compelling with an intelligent directorial decision or two.That is true here. The story is built around contrasting the pettiness and smallness of humanity, especially the Western masculine ethos with the grandeur and size of Nature. To that end Wyler repeatedly pulls his camera back in the action sequences such that the landscape dwarfs the human characters. It is a striking way to bring home the point. But it is a simple-if elegant-idea that a lot of other directors could or would have. The film comes across as a merely a well-constructed Western. If you like the genre-which I do!-this should be up your alley. But it lacks the vividness of the best films.The story is a little long as well-I think the Old Thunder sequence could have been tightened up. The movie lacks the weight of a proper epic.",The Big Country

As the potential sale of the land becomes known, the feud intensifies. During all this Peck's character tries to prove that you don't have to be a hot headed cowboy to be a real man.

38,smatysia,A Big Movie,8,13 November 2001,"Definitely a big movie. Some great performances here as well as stunning photography and interesting direction. Wyler frames so much of the action in huge sweeping vistas, to evoke the film's title. A good job by Peck, playing the sea captain gone west. All the other characters seemed to have him pegged as a pantywaist city slicker from back East, rather than someone who would have to be quite tough to survive in that unknown milieu. His fiancee, was such a spoiled brat type that one wonders what McKay ever saw in her back in Baltimore. There was some strange connection between her and her father, played adequately by Charles Bickford. (They called one another ""Darling"") Jean Simmons as Julie Maragon lit up the screen with her charm whenever she appeared. The supporting cast, however, stole the show. Chuck Connors, as the sniveling, evil Buck Hennessey. Burl Ives, as the Hennessey patriarch. (Oscar winner for this role) And Charlton Heston, as the Ladder Ranch foreman, Steve Leach. An interesting role for Heston to accept, a fairly unlikeable character. The plot and dialogue were thoroughly engaging. I definitely recommend this film. Grade: A",The Big Country

40,barnabyrudge,Majestic western with much to admire.,8,23 September 2007,"Westerns, by their very nature, are mostly quite simplistic films. That's not to say they're bad  some of the simplest westerns of all are actually cinematic masterpieces because they've been pared to the bone for maximum impact. Stagecoach and High Noon, for example. But every now and then a western comes along that adds layers to the basic concept of the genre and becomes something more. This might be layers of psychology, layers of philosophy, layers of brutality  anything, really, that goes beyond the simple western framework and lends a more profound subtext to the film. Notable genre entries that have done this include The Searchers, The Wild Bunch and The Big Country, the latter of which is a 1958 epic made by William Wyler just a year before his incredible remake of Ben Hur.Sea captain Jim Mackay (Gregory Peck) travels to the Wild West to reunite with a lady he met back east, the beautiful Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker). However, Jim finds nothing but hostility and danger in the west, and is quickly taunted by some the locals who find him effeminate and cowardly because of his belief that violence doesn't solve anything. Pat's father Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford) is a wealthy rancher, but Jim is troubled when he discovers that the Major is locked in a long-standing feud over water rights with a rival family, the Hannasseys. It doesn't take Jim long to figure out that Pat is not the woman for him  she may have seemed the perfect match back in the polite society of the East, but in her home region of the West she is dedicated to her father's aggressive attitudes and treats Jim differently, belittling him almost, because of his pacifist views. Worse still, the ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) has designs of his own on Pat and wants to fight Jim for her affection. In the end, Jim switches his attention to school teacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), who owns the patch of land that provides both the Terrills and the Hannasseys with their water. Violence erupts between the two warring families, with Jim and Julie getting caught literally in the middle of their fatal battle for supremacy.There's much to admire about The Big Country. Jerome Moross's amazing score is perhaps the most memorable thing of all, a wonderful piece of dramatic scoring that is now a classic and known by people who haven't even seen the film. It's good to see Peck in such fine form too  often criticised for being too wooden, his acting style here lends perfect credibility to the pacifist hero role. The entire cast in is excellent form if the truth be told, with Burl Ives the choice of the bunch as the fiercely proud leader of the Hannassey clan (an Oscar-winning role, and thoroughly deserving of it). Franz Planer's cinematography is quite majestic and helps the film to live up to its rather grand title. And Wyler directs the film exceptionally well, holding our attention over almost three hours and presenting characters and a back story that are totally convincing and involving. Critics have occasionally accused the film of being overblown, and there is an element of truth in that, and the ending rather unfairly asks us to care about the fate of Bickford and Ives when they've been portrayed as very unsympathetic characters up to that point. On the whole, though, The Big Country is definitely a western worth recommending.",The Big Country
41,Steffi_P,"""Tell me Leech, what did we achieve?""",7,16 December 2009,"This was the era of the epic, and it wasn't just the grand historical extravaganzas that were making it so. Genre movies were getting big as well, none more so than the Western. And why not? If anything could benefit from a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and the increasing ease of colour photography, it was the open plain.But like many of the bigger pictures of the day, especially those from the independent studios, a gallant attempt has been made to add drama to the spectacle. The screenplay went through a lot of hands, usually a good sign, and in this case the hands include those of novelist Jessamyn West and noted Western screenwriter James R. Webb. The outstanding feature here is the dialogue, which has a very clipped pace and even rhythm to it, so that characters snap the lines back-and-forth like pistol shots. The wording is often a little abstract, almost poetic, but the meaning is always clear, and even if they don't sound like things said by real people, the feel of the words always matches the character. It's even slyly comical, with odd lines like the one about Burl Ives' speech being ""a beardful"" likely to raise a smile.The cast is an unusual one, at least at first glance. Gregory Peck never really looked at home in a Western, but this is what makes him ideal for the greenhorn-from-back-East role. In director William Wyler's shooting scheme, he isn't treated to as many close-ups as some of the other characters, and this performance is more about the way he moves or looks out over the landscape. His antagonist Charlton Heston does get a lot of close-ups, as it's up to him to convey his affection for Carroll Baker – never directly referenced – through jealous glances at her and Peck. He does a meaningful but understated job, and this is by far the best I have seen from him. Surely the oddest person to see in a Western is Jean Simmons, but she is very believable in what is also one of the more complex roles. Then of course there is Burl Ives, who deservedly won the picture's only Oscar, by managing to bring out a rough humanity from beneath the bulk and beard. By the way, have a look over that cast list, and think of just how many heads must have turned every time someone yelled out ""Chuck!"" Let's look a bit more at William Wyler's input. His choice of how to shoot each actor at each moment – e.g. close-up, long-shot, face or back to camera – was often very irregular, even to the point of defying film convention, but it was always to serve the nature of the character, the mood of each scene or the picture in general. His previous effort, Friendly Persuasion, also his first in 'scope actually loses some much needed intimacy because Wyler seemed suddenly at odds with the new frame shape. For the Big Country however he actually uses the size of the screen to give a feeling of distance and emptiness. Peck and Carroll have many of their embraces isolated in the middle of the screen. Characters are sometimes seen seated at opposite ends of the frame, the gulf between them exaggerated. And this pattern is carried through into the outdoor shots, Wyler having chosen an extremely flat and barren location. More than once characters make analogies between the plain and the ocean, and Wyler has acknowledged that in the way he films it.A brief note on Jerome Moross's music. This score has been widely praised and resulted in Moross's only Oscar nomination. I grant that it sounds very much the archetypal Western theme, and there are some nice orchestrations. However it is mind-numbingly repetitive, contains some stupid cues (like the ""circus"" music heard after Peck tames Old Thunder) and after two hours and forty minutes becomes banal and grating.A little side point perhaps, that about the music, but I feel it relates to some of this picture's wider problems. The Big Country is just a bit too long. True, some stories do merit a lengthy runtime but this, for all its scope, is still just a little story – a handful of people in a simple situation. It is not the tale of a culture or a generation. And while the score is almost stereotypically Western-ish, the rest of the picture really isn't. Like the earlier High Noon, it is a political allegory set out West, which isn't a bad thing in itself, just that it doesn't really feel quite like a Western. Unlike the excellent Shane, it doesn't seem to have respect for the people or conventions of the genre. As such, it's a worthy but slightly hollow experience.",The Big Country
42,davidmvining,A movie I didn't know about for far too long,10,20 November 2019,"I can't remember why I put The Big Country in my list of movies to watch, but as it started to roll I wondered how I could have ever avoided it. Gregory Peck? Charlton Heston? William Wyler? Epic western? Yeah, the cover art in Netflix was a bit of a joke (Peck standing at a fence, looking out of frame), but with a retinue like that, how could I have resisted?Resist I did for years. I'd put it in my DVD queue and watched as it slowly went from about 400 to about 40. I knew it was available to watch through Amazon Prime, but I just never started it until last night.I immediately regretted having put it off for so long. Wyler is such a low-key director, having made at least one of the biggest movies ever (Ben-Hur), but also having been mostly forgotten. And yet, I was constantly amazed at his skill with a lens. There were oftentimes layers of information expertly arranged within the frame in ways that felt so completely natural. There's a party scene about halfway through the film that gets interrupted and everything falls still. As the interruption leaves the scene, we have a shot of our 5 principles, all at different distances from the camera and looking in the same direction. They're all in focus and perfectly arranged around each other to allow the audience a view at each one, and it feels so perfectly normal.The story overall is such a great mix of intimate and epic. There's a land dispute between two land owners with a third in the middle. Peck comes in and tries to find a third way to keep the peace all the while juggling a dying relationship with his fiancé on one hand and a burgeoning relationship with the current owner of the land in the middle. Alongside we have a wonderful cast of characters highlighted by Charlton Heston's who experiences a great change of heart when he finds out Peck's true character in a fantastic nighttime fight out in the fields.After the movie, I did what I normally do and read through the trivia page. It's a habit I've developed over the years as it helps me to learn a bit more about the film I've just watched. Usually about half the stuff is garbage (""Actor X and Actor Y went on to also be in another movie."" That's...uninteresting.). However, there are always gems. The one for The Big Country was that Wyler and Peck wanted the movie to be an allegory for the Cold War. I didn't notice the supposed allegory as I watched it, and in retrospect, I feel that the allegory doesn't work at all. Perhaps that's why Wyler and Peck were never quite satisfied with the script. Aside from the moral relativism, the nature of the conflict in the movie bears no resemblance to the conflict of America and the USSR. The real conflict was a conflict of ideologies, but the conflict in the movie was a conflict of resources. They're categorically different in nature, which undermines the efforts to point the story to something very specific in the real world. I've become dismissive of allegory in storytelling over the years, and it's usually because they so rarely actually work. It's more of an effort to be clever than to entertain or simply tell a story.Still, it didn't affect the viewing at all, and the movie itself was absolutely fantastic. It's amazing that Wyler and Heston went on to release the gargantuan Ben-Hur just a year later.",The Big Country
43,darbski,One Top Western,10,12 August 2018,"***SPOILERS*** This story follows Donald Hamilton's basic premise: intellect, courage, and perseverance will win the day. Mr. Hamilton is the author of the really great action/thriller series of books about a character named Matt Helm. Now, younger readers will probably never appreciate these book as much as us old farts do, but trust me they were great. The difference lies in how Hollywood dealt with the control of the story by the screenwriter. THIS movie is one of the best conversions (of western stories) ever made. Two others are Elmore Leonard's ""Hombre"", and Louis Lamour's ""The Quick And The Dead"". All good reads, but when shown on the screen, they are different and better than the author had originally produced. This is very rare, indeed, because usually is it exactly the opposite. Mr. Helm's character Matt Helm is transformed from a serious assassin to a drunken clown, complete with circus acts. By the way, Dean Martin was a great actor who could play great parts if the were given him. P.S. Eastwood would have made a perfect Matt Helm. Enough griping.In this story Gregory Peck plays Jim McKay, a fellow who is a very wealthy shipping magnate who comes west to marry a beautiful, but spoiled, and flawed, girl, Pat Terrill, played perfectly by Carol Baker. On the way, he is misunderstood, and misinterpreted to the point of deadly stupidity. Burl Ives plays Rufus Hannassey, A barrel of a man who has without a doubt one of the soliloquys I've ever heard. Short, sweet, eloquent, to the point, and daring. I liked him immediately. Chuck Connors plays his son - a cowardly bully who's hobby is probably pulling wings off of flies. Jean Simmons is the darkly beautiful Julie Maragon, the REAL love interest. The fatal flaw in not understanding someone plays out to a tragic, but hopeful end, in this almost Shakespearean drama. There is plenty of action, but, in the end, it is applied intelligence that wins the day - as it should be. The battle between brute force and brains is played out every day in life, and in this movie the right side wins. I rank this as one of the very best westerns (and movies) ever made. It is a 10 plus.",The Big Country
44,bandw,Blessed are the peacemakers,8,28 February 2012,"James McKay (Gregory Peck) is an easterner who comes west to marry Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker), the daughter of wealthy rancher Maj. Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford). McKay lands in the middle of a dispute between the Terrills and the Hannasseys (ranchers of less financial status) over watering rights on the Maragon property that abuts the two ranches. Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) owns the property in question. Once the principal players are in place the story develops with few surprises.Peck is good at playing strong, silent types of high moral character and he brings that talent to this movie, but I found him less believable in scenes where physical toughness was required. For example, in the marathon fight between McKay and Steve Leech (Charleton Heston, the foreman on the Terrill ranch) it was hard for me to see Peck fighting to a draw. The role calls for a sensitive but tough man along the order of Gary Cooper. Jean Simmons is similarly miscast I think, she does not fit the image of a strong willed independent woman of the old west. I can better picture a Mercedes McCambridge in her role. But Bickford is perfectly cast as Maj. Terrill and Burl Ives steals the show in his Academy Award winning performance as Rufus Hannassey, the head of the Hannassey clan.While this is an entertaining and satisfying western, it comes with a message. We are encouraged to admire McKay as a peacemaker who subscribes to pacifism. For example, after he and Leech decide to call their secret fight a draw, McKay asks, ""Tell me Leech, what did we prove?"" He also tries to bridge the gap between the two warring tribes. And at the end non-violence is advocated as we see that violence begets violence with the ultimate result being mutual destruction of the heads of the two clans.There is some expert horsemanship on display here--the stunt-men must have worked overtime. It is a thrill to see a crew riding through a canyon and a six-team of horses running full out pulling a carriage.The beautifully filmed vistas of the big open range spark the imagination to consider what things were like in the west in the U.S. in the nineteenth century, before autos and too many people. The forlorn little town in this movie is probably pretty realistically portrayed.Finally, the score by Jerome Moross is suitably grand to match the story and the scenery. It is a bit intrusive at times, but once you hear the main melody, you will probably never forget it and forever associate it with this movie.",The Big Country
45,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Great subversive Western, one of the greatest scores for a film ever.",8,4 March 2015,"I'm always appalled at how little William Wyler I've seen. I adore The Best Years of Our Lives and Roman Holiday, but Ben-Hur is underwhelming. Now with The Big Country winning my heart, he really deserves better. I'm a sucker for a good subversive Western. The myth of the American frontier in cinema is fascinating to me and any film that develops the ideas inherently has my attention. The Big Country is credited as the first pacifist Western as Gregory Peck refuses to fight until the last moment or acknowledge the seriousness of any conflict. He's an unconventional hero. One who teeters a line of cowardice. But this just makes him all the more endearing as a three dimensional character. Granted, the film has its caricature characters on the side, but the script has such a dry wit. Burt Ives won an Oscar for his role and coming in an hour into the film, there wasn't much spotlight left to share, but he certainly has his moments. It's a grand epic in visuals and length that I easily sunk into. It's a big country alright. Also boasts one of the best scores I've ever heard. Can't believe it's not considered a greater classic.8/10",The Big Country
46,tomsview,Big in every way,10,6 September 2020,"I first saw ""The Big Country"" at a drive-in around 1961 sitting in the back seat of our family's sedan. The view from there was the equivalent of sitting in a movie theatre behind three fat men wearing sombreros. Even so, I felt the film's power.Gregory Peck's James McKay ends up in Texas in the late 1800's involved with two women and caught in the middle of a feud between Rufus Hannassey and Maj. Henry Terrill, the patriarchs of two powerful families.Emphasising the bigness of the film were the male stars; Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston both standing at 6' 3"" and Chuck Connors at 6' 5"", even Charles Bickford's Major Terrill was almost as tall as Greg and Charlton if you count his crinkly grey hair. Then there was Burl Ives as Rufus Hannessey who may have been wider than he was tall but looked absolutely monolithic. Surely it wasn't all coincidence.There is a dramatic contrast between the two women: blonde, pale, coquettish Carroll Baker as Pat Terrill and the softer-looking, dark-haired Jean Simmons as Julie Maragon. Jean Simmons had already won me when she showed Spartacus something worth fighting for around the same time.Even for those not normally drawn to westerns, the drama in this film is practically Shakespearean, the House of Terrill against the House of Hannassey. Or maybe it's more Freudian, especially the interfamily tensions. There's the conflict between Rufus and his son Buck, where it's a toss-up whether there will be filicide or patricide. And what are all those daddy issues Carol Baker's character seems to be having over at the big Terrill house?The film looks fabulous. William Wyler and the filmmakers got just as much visual power out of the sweeping plains of Texas as John Ford got from Monument Valley.Over the years my respect for Wyler and his films has grown, especially since reading his biography, ""A Talent for Trouble"", and also the book and TV series ""Five Came Back"", which covered his service in WW2.There was one other aspect of the film that made it unforgettable, that stunning score by Jerome Moross. It was music such as this that led me to become a lifelong fan of film music.It's hard to believe that nearly all the stars have gone now; even after 60 years ""The Big Country"" feels like it could have been made yesterday.",The Big Country

48,sme_no_densetsu,"A pretty good, offbeat Western",7,10 August 2008,"William Wyler's ""The Big Country"" concerns a retired sea captain, James McKay (Gregory Peck), thrust into the middle of a squabble over land rights. The conflict pits the father of his fiancée, Major Terrill (Charles Bickford), against the head of a less successful and less refined clan, Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives).The acting is solid throughout with Peck in particular delivering a fine performance. The supporting cast sports some familiar faces as well, including Carroll Baker, Charlton Heston & Jean Simmons. It should also be noted that Burl Ives won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance.The story is an interesting one since it doesn't conform to the usual style of a Western film. Peck's character is an enigma, especially to the rough and tumble Westerners who are quick to brand him as a coward. The romantic element of the plot is not as intrusive as I feared, though it is an essential ingredient in exploring the character of James McKay.From a technical standpoint the film is well done but not outstanding. Wyler clearly tried to live up to the film's title, with a number of shots demonstrating the sheer immensity of the country and illustrating how it dwarfs the men who inhabit it. The score by Jerome Moross was nominated for an Oscar but I didn't really think that it was that great. There are a couple of memorable pieces of music but overall I found the score to be merely average.All in all, this film is worth watching for Western fans and for those who enjoy a drama with a wide scope.",The Big Country

50,jromanbaker,That music!!! That scenery!!! That length!!!,5,14 June 2020,"I waded my way through this overrated Western shown in widescreen on BB2, a British major television channel. Mercifully the BBC shows films without advertisements. I am in a minority, but I see nothing exceptional in this film. It is a VERY American film, sprawling as a lot of mediocre American novels do and straining to be GREAT. For me this is as stolid and worthy of such BIG novels turned into film like ' From Here To Eternity ', ' Gone With The Wind ' and despite the just rightness of its subject matter ' Exodus ', and the list could go on of badly written novels turned into BIG cinema. I think the cast is a mess and on or off screen I cannot buy any relationship of any kind between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. Carroll Baker so good in ' Something Wild ' and ' Baby Doll ' fades into the noise of it all and the scenery. I give it a 5 for that great actress Jean Simmons, bigger to me than this tiresome film and William Wyler's bland direction. Do not get me wrong. I like Westerns, but I am not a fan of this one. It is pretentious and far too conservative in its direction to see it more than once. And the music is terrible, and the opening sounded like an anthem to the GREAT and BIG country America. It flaunts itself with its clean surface and muddled content, brainwashing us to believe it is one of the BIG and GREAT Westerns. A small film in a BIG country.",The Big Country
51,Bob-45,Preachy,6,9 March 2001,"After reading other reviews at the IMDB, I decided to give THE BIG COUNTRY another chance. I remembered anxiously anticipating this film when it was released in 1958.  From the previews it looked BIG, with a powerful cast, and magnificent score (I still believe the overture is the best piece of music ever written for the movies).  I then remember sitting through 165 interminable minutes. What a letdown!  Well, I was nine at the time; so, I figured this time I would catch all those wonderful nuances I would not have understood at age nine.  Upon careful reconsideration, I have decided I was a pretty good critic at nine after all.  THE BIG COUNTRY is a bore. Like a Chicago voter, THE BIG COUNTRY makes its point `early and often'.  It seems a reaction to cold war hysteria, mindful of `Can't we all just get along?' drummed repeatedly into our heads for 160 of the 165 minutes. Give me a break.Wyler's usual composition skills don't work here.  He rarely gets in close enough.  The cinematography overall is mediocre, as is the entire look of the film. I might have well have been watching an old episode of THE VIRGINIAN filmed in letterbox. By THE BIG COUNTRY, star and co-producer Gregory Peck had slipped into the stoic style that ruined most of his later films (just compare his work here with DUAL IN THE SUN, SPELLBOUND, THE GUNFIGHTER or TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH). Only once, during the scene with Jean Simmons `waking him' with cold water, does Peck even suggest that that playful, promising young actor. (Later in his career he rekindled some of that playfulness in HOW THE WEST WAS WON, but that's another movie).  Baker is cute and Simmons is cuddly, but their characters are so underwritten as to give them little opportunity to express much range. THE BIG COUNTRY does have two genuinely great performances, Charleton Heston and Burl Ives.  Ives, in particular, dominates every scene he is in.  Heston, however, has the less showy performance; but his `Steve Leech' brings to mind John Wayne as `Ethan Edwards' in THE SEARCHERS. Unlike the uncompromising (and doomed) Edwards, however, Leech gives in to his fears and becomes `pragmatic.' This may be why Heston didn't receive more recognition for his performance; sad, because he had a much tougher job than Ives.  THE BIG COUNTRY reminds me of a overlong sermon by a old country preacher. It's hard to enjoy even if you know it's good for you.",The Big Country
52,jem132,"Big Country, Great film",8,22 October 2008,"A beautiful, eloquent and thoughtful epic that is perhaps an ""anti-western"". Gregory Peck is perfectly cast as the newly-arrived pacifist who is reluctantly cast into the battle between two powerful families in the Old West, one respected and one considered outcasts. William Wyler directs and probes plenty of questions as to justice, as Charles Bickford's family, for all their position and respect, treat the rough Hannassey clan (headed by bullish Burl Ives) no better than they treat them. In a terrific cast, Carroll Baker is Bickford's spoiled daughter who is engaged to Peck yet doesn't understand him. She's been bred to the ways of the Old West, and she can't understand the sort of man Peck is, and why he won't seem to fight. But her best friend and schoolmarm Jean Simmons (her lovely, down-to-earth quality makes her character very believable)does, and she and Peck fall in love. Charlton Heston smolders in the background as the Bickford's foreman who wants Carroll Baker badly (and these two seem to be made for each other). Aside from the convincing acting, and interesting plot, this is beautifully filmed and has a great musical score. Perhaps it lags in places, and even if it does run for 2 and a half hours some points aren't as fleshed out as I would have liked (I would have liked to have seen more of Heston's character, and Baker just disappears from the film at times). But it's still an excellent film, thoughtful and thought-provoking as the best movies should be.",The Big Country

That is, if there's any law to abide by.""",7,5 February 2017,"THE BIG COUNTRY is a pretty ambitious romantic western that symbolizing independence, freedom and peacefulness in the Wild West. Of course, before the final comprehension, the film was filled with quarrels, open conflicts and killings.One notable sailor from Maryland comes to Texas to start a new life. He is in love with the daughter of a wealthy rancher. However, he realizes that his future father in law has been involved in extremely violent and dirty conflicts with neighboring rancher. A combative father and violent environment adversely affects his fiancée. The stranger will try to change the people and the atmosphere in the Wild West...The film begins with the arrival of a peacemaker and ends with extremely tense duels. Periods of fierce quarrel, conflict, fist fighting and unconvincing romance are arranged in between. An extremely warlike story sends a message of peace and understanding in the end. Ethical contrary are too pronounced, even for a western.Open landscapes are truly impressive. The verbal construction of plots is at a high level also. The soundtrack is excellent.Gregory Peck as James McKay is the epitome of calm and reason in this movie. His character is unobtrusive, but in critical situations, he did not show strong emotions. His character is actually calculated. Charlton Heston as Steve Leech is a completely different character than James. He honestly shows jealousy and malice through strong internal conflict.Burl Ives as Rufus Hannassey is an old fox, who has a strange sense of justice. That justice involves a gun and shot. Charles Bickford as Maj. Henry Terrill is a greedy old man, who wants absolute power over the land. Hatred can really blind a man. The major is a strong character and a leading antagonist. Violence always generates more violence.Jean Simmons as Julie Maragon is a modest teacher and owner of a large and rich ranch at the same time. She is the cause of a conflict. One very brave and beautiful woman was given precedence over the land. Carroll Baker as Patricia Terrill is daddy's little girl, who is torn between love and lifestyle.Mr. Wyler has tried to deconstruct the classic western story.

How he conducts himself is wonderful drama. Bickford is a middle aged ""spoilt brat"" who should've been shot by his parents so greedy and immoral is he, hes taught his daughter everything he knows about greed (you can see Mrs May or Mrs Thatcher) in her antics. The scene in which Peck mounts ""old thunder"" is priceless, then theres the fisticuffs with Charlton Heston, who for this film is neither hero nor villain-but one of those ""do as youre told types""! Which leaves Alfonso Bedoya, Peck, Ives and Jean Simmons to really make the film their own. Stunning performances. Burl Ives is the opposite of rich, but unlike Bickford he does have morals.

56,silverscreen888,Big Allegorical Dramatic Western; Characters Plus Story,8,24 July 2005,"This is a spacious film, with very-wide vistas, the distant horizons of a Southwestern landscape tall skies and copper-colored air. The spare and very straight-line novel by ""Matt Helm"" creator Donald Hamilton suggested these qualities, but fundamentally it was the interposing of a strangely-whole personality, a self-asserting sea captain, into a long-standing feud between two allegorical and implacable western rivals. One was the hard-bitten owner of Ladder ranch, a self-made touchy New England type with a stuck-up family and proud ranch hands; the other was the intelligent patriarch of a brawling clan of Soiuthern-style culturally-backward lower-class types. The narrative that Hamilton developed from this set of elements was not voluminous either. The captain comes to marry the girl he had met, the ranch-owner's daughter. He is kidnapped by the Southerner's boys and hoorahed. The ranch owner is furious about this and takes his revenge on those responsible. While th captain and the girl, who expects him to act like a westerner and take his licks publicly, have their own misunderstanding, the Southerner warns the ranch owner never to intrude in his area, Blanco Canyon, again, on pain of starting a war. The captain ignores advice about how big the land is and, using a compass, he tames an unbreakable horse by dint of falling off over and over again, but with no one to see except a Mexican hostler. He then rides bent on discovery but meets Julie Maragon, who owns the ""Big Muddy"" section, once a worthwhile ranch; and on his return has to fight the foreman who calls him a liar when he says he had not been lost--he what been heading back to the ranch when they found him. The fight is a respectful draw; it turns out the foreman wants to marry the daughter. Then the remainder of the film involves three actions. The ranch owner attacks the Blanco Canyon gang on a pretext, and he and the Southertner kill each other in a duel to the death. The girl refuses the captain; and he has already decided to marry Julie, daughter of the former owner of the strategic Big Muddy section, and allow water rights to both sides, ending the pretext for their long quarrel; this leaves the daughter free to marry the foreman. Jerome Moross did intelligent and spacious-sounding music to accompany this long and interesting character drama on horseback. William Wyler directed lyrically with a real sense of space, from a script adapted by Jessamyn West and Robert Wyler, with the script being finished by veteran writers Sy Bartlett and Robert Wilder and James R. Webb. Franz. F. Planer did the crystal-clear cinematography, with art direction by Frank Hotaling. The set decoration was done very opulently by Edward G. Boyle with costumes being designed by Emile Santiago and Yvonne Wood. This was a feature produced for himself by Gregory Peck with Wyler. He is excellent in the lead as James McKay, sea captain. The rival heads of he outfits were played by Charles Bickford and Burl Ives, both giving award caliber performances. Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker played Julie Maragon and the fiancée-daughter,respectively, with Charlton Heston as the foreman Steve Leach, Chuck Connors' as the Southerner's rebellious son, and veteran Alfonso Bedoya as the Mexican who befriends McKay. No one else in this very clear and ruthlessly-developed film is given very much to do. Some of the sense of a fatal conflict stems from this portrayal of opposing forces moving toward a confrontation neither admits they want but which they do too little to avoid. The director makes a strange choice as Peck discovers the old house on the Maragon property; he suddenly shoots the scene from Julie's point of view; I believe this to have been an tactical weakening of the film's progress, but the viewer must judge whether it serves Julie's introduction better than conventional point of view would have done. But there are a great many virtues to this consistently-stylish production. Some are the dialogue scenes between Peck and Carroll Baker, the arguments between Ives and Bickford, and the pacing of the entire film, which is deliberate where it is made to be deliberate and is caused to proceed swiftly where it must. This is a very good drama masquerading as a western; and it seems to me clearly to be an allegory of what caused the civil War, played out on the Texas plains with the addition of a man of Lincolnesque un-common sense set into the middle of the tense situation. It is also the last film Wyler directed before the mammoth mounting of ""Ben-Hur"". Highly recommended.",The Big Country
57,virek213,Waist-Deep In The Big Muddy With Gregory Peck And Company,10,12 November 2013,"It was Sam Peckinpah who, following the massive and controversial success of his epic and violent western THE WILD BUNCH in 1969, said: ""The Western is a universal framework on which it is possible to comment on today."" That approach can be said to have started in the 1950s with the more topical adult westerns like HIGH NOON and SHANE, and which greatly expanded into the 1960s, culminating with Peckinpah's masterpiece near that decade's end. And one of those 1950s westerns that helped point the way was director William Wyler's expansive 1958 opus THE BIG COUNTRY.Reputed to have been then-president Dwight Eisenhower's favorite film, THE BIG COUNTRY, based on the novel of the same name by Donald Hamilton, stars Gregory Peck (who co-produced the film with Wyler, and who delivers another excellent low-key performance) as a ship's captain who has ventured out West to marry the girl (Carroll Baker) that he had left behind. What he has gotten himself into by going West, however, is quite complicated. Baker's family the Terrills, whose patriarch is played by Charles Bickford, are a high-class bunch involved in a very fractious class and range war with the Hennessys, a more ""redneck"" clan whose patriarch is played by Burl Ives (in the role that justifiably won him an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor). The object of this war is a stretch of the Big Muddy River where that most valuable of all Western assets, water, is for their cattle, and each wants it for themselves as bad as the other. But the spread is tended to by a schoolteacher (Jean Simmons), who is a close friend of Baker's. Peck, in the hopes of placating both sides, agrees to sign a deed and co-own the spread with Simmons. But the range war intensifies and comes to a climax near Ives' spread in the narrow confines of Blanco Canyon.Movies don't often live up to their own titles, let alone the hype that just as often goes with them, but THE BIG COUNTRY is a big exception, largely because an exacting master like Wyler is behind the camera, and also because he and Peck have assembled such a stellar cast. Chuck Connors, just a year or two away from portraying Lucas McCain on TV's ""The Rifleman"", portrays Ives' none-too-sharp son with appropriate rural menace; and Charlton Heston, fourth billed this time around, is equally good as Bickford's main ranch foreman who takes an instant dislike to Peck until the two men engage in a nighttime fistfight on the back forty and Peck wins, proving himself to be a man in Heston's eyes. There is also the final appearance of Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya (he of ""I don't got to show you no stinkin' badges"" fame in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE) as Bickford's Mexican wrangler. The superb wide screen cinematography of Franz Planer is equally impressive, done primarily on location in the San Joaquin Valley in central California; Red Rock Canyon State Park in the Mojave Desert in southern California; and Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona.One other aspect of THE BIG COUNTRY that one wishes the Academy Awards had recognized is the classic Americana score by Jerome Moross, one of the best scores ever done not only for a Western, but for any film in general, period; its title theme promises what the rest of the film pays off in spades. It belongs up there, in terms of Western film scores, with Elmer Bernstein's score for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN; Jerry Fielding's for THE WILD BUNCH; and Ennio Morricone's for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.Indeed, THE BIG COUNTRY belongs on the shelf, alongside those other films, of any self-respecting fan of Westerns. Though quite long at 167 minutes, thanks to Wyler's direction, a great cast, and a great screenplay, the drama and tension never flag. You can't go wrong with this film by any means.",The Big Country
58,trpdean,One of the great movies,9,6 October 2005,"Whether or not you care a hoot about westerns or western scenery, whether or not you like Gregory Peck or Jean Simmons, whether or not you like movies with action - this is a powerful moving experience.The movie has so many Shakespearean tones - the father-son relationship, the rival families, the mismatched romantic couple - it will remind you of so many of his plays. It was also said to be Wyler's comment on the Cold War - and probably also reflects the feelings of a director who grew up in Alsace-Lorraine and felt from birth the enmity between the French and Germans before World War I.One of the things I most enjoyed was the way in which the viewer had some sympathies with every single one of the seven main characters.The least sympathetic is probably the Chuck Connors role -- yet even with him, one feels right from the start his dynamism, his love of life, his all-too-human pleasure in things. He's not a simple bully - in some respects he could easily fit in with the trio of Gunga Din who burst from windows, enjoy women to the fullest if they aren't tied down, play tricks, and live life to the fullest. The director makes us FEEL the joy of Connors and his brothers in showing off, in their daring, their vivacity when we see them on horseback early in the movie.The most sympathetic are Peck and Simmons - and wow, what a combination. They were born to play opposite each other - and it's terribly sad that this is their only pairing.Charles Bickford, Burl Ives, Carroll Baker, Charlton Heston, we feel with each one. For example, Baker is given a wonderful scene in which she pleads that she will do whatever it takes to get Peck back, apologizes for her behavior, insists it will never happen again. She is shallow, too young for Peck, concerned enormously with appearances - yet Wyler shows us a warm creature easily capable of love and affection.We feel with Heston - who has grown up loving a woman who has put him in his place and who has now tied herself to a stranger - who will presumably in time became his boss even though Heston was raised as practically a stepson to Bickford. We see Heston subtly change over the course of the film - to an independence of Bickford that is wonderfully done.The astonishing courage of Bickford's character, his stamina, his truly rugged independence, his native refinement, and his outrage at the coarseness of the Hennessys, is so well-drawn.Ives' character is brilliantly drawn too - a great sense of fair play, an admiration for gentlemen - which he is decidedly not and knows - a feeling that he has never gotten much of what he wanted, his disappointment in his son - these are fascinating to see.This is really a great movie - with great characters who themselves cause the plot to go the only way it could.My only objection is the too neat ending - but Simmons and Peck just looking at each other is SO right.Don't miss this. It is both powerful and subtle - it is never rushed and devotes time to the development of all the seven characters which I find quite rate in movies generally.Thus, we see Simmons and Baker together alone - and Baker's comment, ""You always think you know everything"" to Simmons gives us a pretty strong idea of their characters' relation before the movie ever began.We see Heston alone with Baker - his barely suppressed desire breaking out - and her feeling that he is beneath her.We see wonderful scenes of Bickford and Heston alone together - and the great scene where we realize that the men hold with Heston far more than with their nominal boss when they refuse to go where Heston won't go.This is monumental - fascinating - very American - and wonderful.",The Big Country
59,januszlvii,My Favorite Western,10,20 April 2021,"The Big Country is currently on Amazon Prime, so it is a great opportunity to watch. It is my all time favorite western and there are so many highlights it is not funny. Perhaps my favorite was James McKay ( Gregory Peck) trying to ride Old Thunder a supposedly unridable horse. It is a one on one battle and you need to see the way McKay looks at Old Thunder and the horse looks at him. The horse keeps throwing McKay and McKay keeps getting getting back on him, until he finally breaks the horse. The music in that scene really works well. It also might be the closest Gregory Peck came to doing any kind of comedy. Second to that is the fight between McKay and Terrill foreman Steve Leech ( Charlton Heston). With the exception of John Wayne versus Randolph Scott in The Spoilers the best fight I ever saw in a western. What I like about McKay is he is self confident and does not need to prove himself to anyone. There is one scene where he breaks up with his fiancé Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker) because she finds out that he is not weak and can be led around like sheep. When she told him she was angry about not telling her about the horse the fight and buying a piece of valuable land called the ""Big Muddy"" and sharing water with a family she and her father the Major ( Charles Bickford) hate The Hannasseys led by Rufus played by Oscar Winner Burl Ives. He said ""Your the last person I need to explain myself to if you really love me."" Pat is a real piece of work. She is so in love with her father, she does not think anyone can complete with him ( McKay included). McKay is summed up best by Terrill ranch hand Ramon Gutierrez ( Adolfo Bedouin) the one person who saw McKay versus Old Thunder to Pat and eventual love interest Julie Maragon ( Jean Simmons) ""He is a rare man."" Speaking of Julie she is the person who sold McKay The Big Muddy, which she inherited from her grandfather. You got the idea that it will be Julie and not Pat that McKay ends up with when Pat says ""You defend him ( McKay) so much it's like you want him for yourself?"" Julie said nothing. The scenes between McKay and Julie are few and they rarely speak ( three times in the film), but you can tell the attraction is there. It also goes without saying Julie is a nicer character then Pat ( without excessive baggage) and of course, Jean Simmons is better looking then Carol Baker. Watch Jean Simmons and her eyes very expressive. One last character is Rufus's son. Buck played by Chuck Connors. He is a quick draw artist and a coward ( one of the nastiest characters you will ever find in a western. Not quite Dennis Hopper in the Young Land, but pretty close). Just wait until he has to have a dual with McKay and cannot use his fast draw, he shows his true colors: Yellow. The standouts are Connors, Simmons, Peck and especially Ives as well as the music and Director William Wyler. A must see western and my all time favorite. Easy 10/10 stars.",The Big Country
60,aramis-112-804880,Best of the West,7,24 January 2014,"Forget the nonsense about this movie being a left-wing allegory of the Cold War. If you're like me you're heartily sick of the left's mendacity on the whole issue, making movies &c. about how awful it was and protesting *only* in America (since the radical left -- forgive the redundancy -- supported the Soviets and hoped they would win; goodness knows they were quick enough to spy for Soviets and give them secrets undermining U. S. national security, sovereignty, and safety. Despite their freedom to make movie propaganda they were they same enemies of American freedom then as now). Also forget the idiotic notion that surly Charles Bickford was a stand-in for genial Eisenhower. ""The Big Country"" is a whale of a good western.Story: Two cattle barons (the upscale ""Major"" and his delectable daughter against white trash Rufus Hannassey and his violent sons) want to drive each other out of business, their fight centering (but not caused by) a plot of land called ""the Big Muddy"" owned by Julie Maragon. Into this volatile situation steps James McKay, scion of a prominent eastern family, just retired from being a captain on his rich family's shipping lines. Though originally set to marry the Major's delectable daughter, McKay joins forces with Julie Maragon in an effort to bring peace to . . . ""The Big Country""! The cast is phenomenal. The bickering cattle barons are played by Charles Bickford and forever-angry Burl Ives (he always sings so pleasantly but plays such nasty men in the movies). Supporting them are Chuck Connors (""The Rifleman"") as old man Hannasey's vicious, whoremongering, rapist and ultimately cowardly eldest boy, Buck; and no less a luminary than Charlton Heston as the Major's ranch foreman, Steve, who was adopted by the Major as a stray waif and is emphatic in his loyalty to his foster father.Gregory Peck is perfect as the idealist McKay, a typical upscale, northeastern, rich leftist who never solves a problem by striking at its root but who tries to force peace by jawing at it and treating it with placebos (shades of Munich 1938).As for the ladies, Jean Simmons is out of her natural habitat as ""Big Muddy"" owner Julie Maragon, but she deserves better than becoming the stereotyped maiden in distress as she is taken captive by Old Man Hannasey, with her virginity threatened by Connors' Buck. Carroll Baker is the Major's daughter, delectable until she opens her whiny mouth.The good: A) the scenery; B) the movie's Oscar-nominated score, including one of the great opening western themes, that holds its own against the opening themes of ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" and even the iconic ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" C) something you see in too few westerns, an actual duel between McKay and Buck Hannassey, using honest-to-god one-shot dueling pistols.The Bad: the script is weak in parts. Gregory Peck's McKay poses as a peacemaker and when he does speak he spouts a lot of hypocritical blather about peace. But he stirs up a lot of consternation by refusing to talk when a few soothing words of explanation are needed to clear up misunderstanding he has caused. In that way it's like the lowest form of comedy, which builds up on layers of misunderstanding just because the characters are too stupid to actually say a few words in season. It's a clumsy plot device and a serious flaw in character development.The Ugly: Alfonso Bedoya's Ramón is embarrassingly stereotyped as the Mexican groom. Shameful. And don't blame ""the times."" A western making the pretense of having an adult mind and modern sensibilities should not use ethnic slaps as cheap humor; it is just more of Hollywood's insincerity and exposes its real attitude toward otherness.My favorite scene: the Major finally rides for a showdown with the Hannaseys when they abduct Julie Maragon. After obeying the Major throughout the picture, Heston's Steve refuses to be party to any more violence, and his men agree with him. So the Major rides to Julie's rescue alone. Then Steve's appreciation for all the Major has done to him weighs on his conscience and he rides around the mountain to join the Major -- and die with him, as Steve knows the whole thing is an ambush where the Hannasseys are hunkered down ready to murder all the Major's men in cold blood. The Major and Steve ride together a little further, then the rest of the Major's men come galloping around the mountain. It's a moving moment, since Steve has told everyone it's an ambush; but the necessity of saving Julie Maragon makes their lives worth sacrificing. This scene is impossible to catch in pan-and-scan. ""The Big Country"" MUST be seen in the letterbox format! One final word on the movie being an alleged leftist Cold War allegory: I wouldn't be surprised if it was true since in the leftist mythology the U.S. was always the aggressor. Fortunately, unlike other propaganda pieces ""The Big Country"" can be thoroughly enjoyed outside any obnoxious political context.",The Big Country
61,ragosaal,A Good Western Indeed,7,18 October 2006,"++++++++ THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SOPILERS ++++++++No one can say that ""The Big Country"" is not a good piece of cinema. It has beautiful photography in great open wide sceneries, outstanding music that goes perfectly along with the sense of spectacle the film transmits, an interesting story, good action scenes and a really competent cast.Gregory Peck is very good as the strange man that comes from the east and feels he doesn't have to proof his courage to anyone. Jean Simmons as his romantic alternative is as good as usual and so is Carol Baker as Peck's bride who can't understand his man's behaviour. Charlton Heston is fine too as the tough top man in the ranch. And Burl Ives surely deserved his supporting actor's Oscar as the not so mean but rather reasonable cattle man that fights for survival against Baker's wealthy and selfish father.But nonetheless a film that has so many highlights sort of lacks something for me and I'm not sure what it is. Perhaps the finale with Ives and Bickford killing each other is too conventional and convenient to put all things straight; or perhaps there are too many romantic mixed emotions among the main characters Peck, Baker, Simmons and Heston (you could include Chuck Connors too). I really can't figure it out yet.But I insist, ""the Big Country"" is a good piece of cinema.",The Big Country
62,alfiefamily,A Magnificently Filmed Classic Western,9,18 November 2008,"""The Big Country"" is cinematically one of the most beautiful films ever made. Filmed in parts of California and Arizona, it has some absolutely breathtaking landscapes, and terrific use of Technicolor. It is beyond me how Franz F. Planer was overlooked for an Academy Award nomination.The story revolves around Jim McKay (Gregory Peck), who comes west in order to marry the daughter (Carroll Baker) of one of the area's largest ranchers(Charles Bickford). Being from the East, he is not familiar with the ways of the West. Almost from the beginning he steps into the middle of a classic western feud over land rights(between Bickford and Burl Ives). But McKay, being from the East is a pacifist. He refuses to fight unless he feels a need to and will do so only on his terms.Obviously this sets him up for much ridicule among the cattlemen, including the main ranch hand( Charleton Heston) who is in love with McKay's fiancé.All of the actors mentioned above, along with Jean Simmons who plays another key role in the land dispute, give top notch performances. Top honors go to Burl Ives as the leader of one of the families, and Charleton Heston, who in a smaller than usual role, excels as the ranch hand Steve Leech.The one peculiar part of the story however is the part of Jim McKay. While Gregory Peck is excellent in the role, the role itself seems to be there solely for the use of getting the pacifist view across. It has nothing to do with the final resolution in the land dispute. I believe if the McKay character were omitted, there would still be a good movie here, albeit, more of a formula, standard western.But that is of small consideration. In the end, ""The Big Country"" is a wonderful film that is loaded with excellent performances and told in a sweeping, cinematic way.",The Big Country
63,daniewhite-1,Too Big Runtime,7,9 September 2021,"Overlong and inefficient but powerful and well handled by almost all involved, 'The Big Country' has lots of everything including some giant steaks that defy sense...also high stakes over watering access and personality clashes between two cattle ranching dynasties.Gregory Peck is the protagonist and his character gets a long time to take in the situation, for my money, too long.The musical score is commendable and fits the scale and tone of the piece and the sound design is well blended.Some indoor scenes are rather static, clunky and flat but when outdoors they are well staged and photographed almost all the way through.'The Big Country' is always at its best when outdoors with its overlarge themes and characters having sufficient room to show off.The performances are strong across the cast, with particular mention for Gregory Peck who handles the different tempos his character must exhibit with a well crafted performance, he gets good support, and Burl Ives handles his part with zest.After such a protracted narrative it's a shame that certain interactions are too neatly curtailed to be believable, which occurs more and more as a rather unbelievable climax approaches.The climax is my main reservation regarding 'The Big Country': it's unbelievable, overly drawn out, and then gives neat and tidy resolutions to character conflicts, not just once or twice but several times over and this after a bloated duration setting the climax up whilst some characters disappear from view altogether such as Carrol Baker's cast aside fiance.Here the inefficiency of the film is most easily observed as it thuds along, neat resolution piled upon neat conclusion after a timorously slow and tangential build up of over two hours screen time.However it has a power in its topic of western standards, it's theme of resource and family rivalry, it's tone of a contemplative and comparative protagonist and beautiful scenery, excellent cast and marvelous score; none of which can be ignored.I rate a 7/10, just about a seven, and I recommend to fans of Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Burl Ives and fans of long films that provide an immersion in broad themes, topics and tonalities.",The Big Country
64,vranger,One of the very few best westerns ever,10,1 June 2009,"Somehow I missed this western for many decades, and its actually for the best that I did. If I had seen this movie earlier, it would have been a pan and scan version that completely misses great shots in the movie, including one of the most dramatic ever filmed in a western.I first saw this on a TCM showing, which gave me the widescreen version this movie deserves. Don't watch it on Encore Westerns, as they show the pan and scan version.For the story itself, the brilliance of this movie is a main character in a western that never fires a shot at a bad guy. In fact, the hero fires only one shot, and that into the dirt.It is easy to think of this film as epic in scope, even tho only a few days are covered by it. The classic conflict between the 'civilized' cattle baron and his backwoods foe sets a stage in which the full panoply of western pageantry is displayed ... everything but a quick drawing hero. ;-) Captain McKay (Gregory Peck) is unarguably the best definition of a ""man's man"" that has ever appeared on film. He is not more heroic or more highly skilled than other film heroes. He is simply the best centered, most self confident man ever in a film role. He doesn't need to prove himself to anyone BUT himself. That is a refreshing and unique take on a film hero.Watch this movie and just enjoy. It is among the top 5 westerns ever made, and likely among the top 25 or so films ever made.",The Big Country
65,NewEnglandPat,A classic western with a great music score,8,25 June 2005,"This classic western is one of the all-time greats and has a wonderful cast and a classic music score. All the elements for an excellent film are here and everyone delivers in grand style. The story is has a basic western plot of a water dispute between ranchers that has festered for years and has developed into a blood feud between the two families. Gregory Peck is the main figure and his polished, urbane demeanor doesn't sit well with rugged western types. Peck is betrothed to a spoiled, selfish young lady but he is involved in another romantic angle that plays out later in the film. Charlton Heston expertly essays the part of a tough, quick tempered foreman and he and Peck engage in a memorable punch out. Charles Bickford and Burl Ives are the tough old patriarchs who are determined to destroy each other more out of principle than for water. Carroll Baker and Jean Simmons are great as young women who bring very different attributes to the the picture, both being quite the opposite of the other. The golden western landscapes are shown to wonderful advantage and Jerome Moross' memorable music score is a superb accompaniment to a great film.",The Big Country
66,loza-1,Don't Underestimate this Film. It's Big.,10,28 May 2005,"The story seems quite simple, and it is. The important thing is the way that the characters interact with one another.Major Tirrell's daughter brings her fiancé from the East, a sea captain. He doesn't know the country too well, and is waylaid by the Hannasey's tearaway son on the way to the Tirrell ranch.At first we are introduced to Major Tirrell and his family. They are the good guys, and the Hannesseys are the bad guys. And what a swine that Burl Ives is when he turns up at the Tirrell ball and makes a scene.But gradually we begin to see things differently. As we learn more about the behaviour of the characters, we see that for all the faults of his no-good son, Hannasey is more a man of honour than Tirrell will ever be.It turns out that the sea captain played by Gregory Peck is well capable of taking care of himself; and, with map and compass, can navigate across country as though he were at sea. Contrary to what everybody thinks, he can handle himself in both armed and unarmed combat, too.It is indeed a big country: huge vistas, accompanied by BIG music composed by Jerome Moross. But however big the country may be, it is just too small for Tirrell and Hannasey, and their petty feud ends up in death and destruction.Very well made film with great acting, Burl Ives coming out first among equals.",The Big Country
67,skoyles,One of the greatest Westerns; one of the greatest movies,10,26 February 2006,"A masterpiece, pure and simple. I saw ""The Big Country"" when It came out and I was in my very early teens. I thought it was over at the one hour thirty-nine minute mark; it was the longest motion picture I had ever seen. And I could not appreciate it at the time. Oh, I liked Peck's character very much but missed all the amazing nuances of the complex characters, for this is not only a Western but also a capital ""R"" Romance, a study in loyalties (most clearly seen in Heston's role. Is this his finest performance? Ives won the Oscar, and deservedly so, but Conners never again came close to the talent he showed as Buck, and Bickford crowned his long career in this triumphant human drama of love, family, power, blood, money and land. The true star of this wonderful motion picture is actually the title character: it is about ""The Big Country"". It is the West. It does not matter if it be Texas or Alberta; it could as easily have been oil rather than cattle (as was attempted not nearly so well in ""Giant""); or it could have been gold (as in the inferior ""Pale Rider""): Wyler here captures the essence of the West in a pre-Leone Shakespearean human epic of the West.",The Big Country
68,hbs,all-star cast in entertaining western,7,3 June 2001,"It's not a great western (it's not even as good as ""Angel and the Badman""), but it's entertaining. Jean Simmons is pretty, there is a fairly insulting Mexican American stereotype character, Peck and Heston are wooden, Connors simpers and schemes, and Burl Ives doesn't sing a note: what more could you want in a movie? Also, the settings are breathtaking, and the score is rousing. As I mentioned, Peck delivers his usual wooden performance, but here it's right for the role. He plays a sea captain who has transplanted himself to somewhere in the West (this someplace apparently covers thousands of square miles -- one set of characters live in the mountains, and the other on the plains, yet they routinely ride between these locations -- it's part of the charm of the movie). Part of the plot, which is pleasantly silly, is that the cowboys wouldn't realize that a sea captain from the 1800's would have to be tough as nails, so Peck's forbearance gets him labelled a sissy, and he has to beat the tar out of a couple of people before this confusion gets cleared up. (Kind of like the ""Kung Fu"" TV series plots.)This is one of those movies like ""Friendly Persuasion"" that just looks too good to be true. Whereas in that movie you kept watching for a wood-sided station wagon (a joke by Pauline Kael), here the scale is bigger so you are looking for golf carts. In short, I don't know why I like this movie so much, but I've watched it at least half a dozen times, and I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD (the DVD is disappointing, though -- there is nothing on it but the movie and a scratchy trailer; apparently the laser disc version had lots of interesting extra stuff). It's vintage trot-trot, bang-band...",The Big Country
69,StevenKeys,The Big Country,10,19 September 2020,"Often overlooked by classic fans, even those with a Western bent, TBC is not your typical sagebrush saga for it runs wide and deep. It's also a long one, projecting for the good part of 3 hours. And like all great epics (Gone-With-The-Wind Ben-Hur Lawrence-of-Arabia The-Sound-of-Music DWW), every scene will engage, i.e., no dry spells.Once again we find the music, a Moross score that sets your spurs to spin right from the opening credits (Bass), is essential to the story and feelings co-producers Wyler and Peck seek to elicit from viewers. It's a full flavored feature with strong-willed men, equally determined women, a moonlight fist-fight, good natured hazing, a clever horse (Old Thunder) and sage vaquero in Al ""Badges"" Bedoya making his finale (d.57) (""A man like (Jim) is very rare""). Grudges and non-conformity are its over-riding themes but water rights and the intoxicating nature of the American West are its under-currents.And while Pat's parental passion (her black & mesh Santiago-Wood number worn at the big shindig is just divine) made Jim's choice-of-partner crystal clear, deciding between lookers Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker on appearance alone is like having to choose between food and water, something sensible humans are loath to do.In the end, we discover a friendship (Jim & Julie) as satisfying as any of the unlikely loves in cinema. If it's not Wyler's (Mrs-Miniver Best-Years) or Heston's best (Ben-Hur Apes Soylent), it's certainly best for the rest. This one's a real beauty (4/4) (UA).",The Big Country
70,eastbergholt2002,Intelligent Western,9,8 December 2006,"I have always had a soft spot for The Big Country. I had been brought up on the films of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood where Western heroes had their own macho code and amazing fighting skills. This movie was a bit subversive, and subtly questions the mythology of the old Western. Despite its age The Big Country is still an entertaining movie.Jim McKay (Gregory Peck) arrives in the West to marry Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker). Pat is the daughter of Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford) a successful rancher. The major is involved in a feud, over watering rights, with a white-trash clan led by Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives). Terrill and Hannassey behave like ruthless mafia dons. McKay met his fiancé in the East, but becomes troubled by her devotion to the major and his values. The Terrill's ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston)takes an immediate dislike to McKay and tries to provoke him into fisticuffs. Leech is the major's chief thug. McKay soon decides the major is not a gentleman and ends the engagement. He quickly falls in love with Pat's best friend Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) a local schoolteacher. Maragon owns a stretch of land which provides the water to the Terrill and Hannassey ranches and because of this she is kidnapped and nearly raped by the Hannasseys. McKay doesn't feel obliged to live by the values of the Hollywood Western. He doesn't carry a gun, has strange pacifist notions and wears fancy clothes. Despite being a former ship's captain he is suspected of being effeminate and a coward. The Big Country has some similarities to Pleasantville. McKay is a man with 20th century attitudes who stumbles into a world culturally different. Maragon and McKay are the only main characters who are admirable or likable. Inevitably, McKay eventually proves that he is a real man. He has a secret fight with Steve Leech and tames a wild horse called Old Thunder. He makes Leech and the stable-hand swear to keep both events quiet regardless of the outcome. He later fights a duel with Hannassey's son (Chuck Connors). The screenplay is based on a novel by Donald Hamilton. The movie was directed by William Wyler, who won three Best Director Oscars. Wyler was regarded as a great director in his day, but is now out of fashion.The movie has an excellent cast, with Ives winning the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his performance. The film was also nominated for an Oscar for Jerome Moross's brilliant and memorable musical score. Although many films from the 1950s now seem dated, this is still enjoyable.",The Big Country
71,doug-balch,"Overrrated ""Range War"" Western",4,18 July 2010,"William Wyler directed this big budget spectacle. Critics always loved Wyler. His movies dominated the Academy Awards for decades (Burl Ives won Best Supporting Actor in this one). This was Wyler's second and last Western of the talkie era. He directed Gary Cooper in ""The Westerner"" 18 years earlier. I found both movies very disappointing.Here's what I liked:Wyler excelled at creating compelling heavies. Walter Brennan's Judge Roy Bean in ""The Westerner"" may the best Western bad guy ever. Here Chuck Conners gets the best role of his career. His sniveling ""inadequate son"" henchman makes my ""Top Ten Western Henchman"" list. Very similar to Jack Lord's excellent character in ""The Man From The West"", released the same year. Of course, both Conners and Lord went on to '60's TV stardom.Gregory Peck is well cast as the bottled up pacifist.The characters are well developed and there are no glaring plot holes.It's impressive thematically as a pacifist metaphor during the height of the Cold War. ""The Westerner"" was similar, but was a metaphor for U.S. isolationism leading into WW2.It's a good looking movie if you like a lot of shots of wide open prairie.Charlton Heston underplays his role perfectly as the ""cattle baron's adopted son turned loyal foreman"" (See Arthur Kennedy in ""The Man From Laramie"" and Burt Lancaster in ""Vengeance Valley"" for similar characters).Now here's what I didn't like:Nice acting job by Peck, but he's not my idea of a Western hero. In that sense, this is an ""anti-Western"" like ""High Noon"". Like I always say, if I was anti-Western, I would watch musicals and romantic comedies, not this movie.I'm not a big fan of ""range war"" Westerns. They tend to get stuck in one place. The landscapes in this movie are impressive, but limited.The story is too melodramatic. I felt like I was watching ""Peyton Place Goes West"". Usually the romantic subplots in Westerns are gratuitous. Here we have the opposite problem. Romance is overdeveloped to the point where this is barely a Western.I liked Carol Baker in this, but I don't get the attraction of Jean Simmons. Never went for Audrey Hepburn either.I didn't buy Burl Ives's character. I thought he overacted and was very ""stagy"".I thought the musical soundtrack was indulgent and intrusive.There is not an iota of comic relief.Not a single Indian or Mexican reference, except for a highly stereotyped Mexican servant. Like George Stevens (""Shane"") and Fred Zinneman (""High Noon""), Wyler wasn't really a Westerns director. All three men had little understanding of the milieu of the era and saw little reason to include these colorful cultural elements.The conflict resolution at the end feels a little contrived. Also, it was unclear to me just how ""peace"" was going to come so naturally with so many potential claims on the land, considering the two main owners die simultaneously.As Peck and Simmons stared contentedly into the sunset in the film's final scene, I cringed, fearing they would once again remind us that the country was, indeed, ""big"".",The Big Country

Two feuding families that would rather shoot each other rather than share a river to water their cattle. Gregory Peck plays the one character that has good intentions. Its interesting to see Chuck Conner's playing a 6'6"" 245 pound coward. Some critics say it's too long at 166 minutes but I really can't think of one scene that could have been deleted.

Larger than life is the word suitable for this movie. The grand old wild west shown in it's entire grandeur with the help of long shots, over head shots etc. The movie is about a Easterner gentleman correctly played by Peck and his experiences in the wild and un-sophisticated west. Caught in a feud between two families, how he manages to restore sanity amidst anarchy is the basic story. The movie also asks some important questions. Does a sophisticated lifestyle mean a sophisticated mindset? Are the so called unsophisticated poor people always to be blamed for anarchy? Or are they forced to create it etc etc. This is an excellent western which deserves to be in the top of any western lists. I consider it a masterpiece and very under-rated piece of cinema. Gregory Peck is perhaps the last 'gentleman actor' that ever lived along with Jimmy Stewart. He oozes class in this role as an Eastern gentleman. The lead actresses Simmons and Baker are both impressive. Heston plays a tough guy the best way he can. Burl Ives also is impressive. Overall, I recommend it even though it is a bit long.Rating : 8/10",The Big Country
74,mgumsley,"Sixty years on, this movie encapsulates what the west was all about.",9,28 April 2020,"Water. Mostly the West, as we know it, was wide, sweeping prairie. That meant endless landscapes.... beautiful sunsets.... awe inspiring canyons... and little water for those early settlers to feed their cattle and grow their crops. So, essentially the story is about feuding families and their rights to use the water from the lyrically-named Big Muddy. I am not ashamed to admit I have watched this film innumerable times, it has been a favourite since my childhood.
Everything is perfect about the film from William Wyler's sure-handed direction to the equally perfect casting and acting. Gregory Peck was a huge star of that era and his acting was often seen as tepid. He is wonderful in this part, showing pacifism allied with common sense and integrity just when it was needed. The rest of the cast were just as good, particularly Burl Ives who picked up Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and he dominated every scene in which he appeared.
I could go on forever: I can never get that haunting music out of my head and often hum it for days after I have seen the movie. As one of your other reviewers said, this is an instant classic that deserves more attention than it has garnered over the years. And it made a huge star out of a man who had a relatively small part in the movie: Charlton Heston, whose brawny frame is shown off to good effect in the fight scene.",The Big Country

76,abcj-2,Love this film!,8,9 May 2011,"The Big Country (1958) is one of my favorite films. William Wyler knew how to make the country look big indeed, and the production quality is unparalleled for the time. It is a beautiful sweeping western epic. It doesn't quite fit the mold of the classic gritty westerns that were common for the time. The plot involves water rights and feuding families, which seems like a commonplace theme. However, the film isn't commonplace at all and stands head and shoulders above weaker films with similar plots.I also like having some romance in a film, and I think there is just enough without detracting from the overall drama. I will say that I prefer my heroes to be more...well,... heroic. At first, Gregory Peck seems a bit of a sissy, but if the setting was on a ship at sea, then I'm sure he'd be quite the commanding hero. Having seen the film several times now, this doesn't bother me anymore. He proves his point to himself and the audience in the bucking bronco scene. That scene really works for me.I have a bit of sass and spitfire in me, so Peck's pacifist approach to life also took some getting used to initially. However, due to multiple connective and genetic immune diseases, I've learned to tone down myself and am now inspired by his pacifism. I also know that Peck is a fine actor with a wide range, and I've been a fan for decades. I was never a Jean Simmons fan until this film. Carroll Baker is ho-hum to me, but Simmons' magic shines through. I actually have made a point to watch more of her delightful films after seeing her in this one. I was blown away by Burl Ives' performance. Wow!! One tough cookie and so glad he won the Oscar.I could go on, but I think it's clear that I highly recommend this film.",The Big Country

78,alecwest,Magnificent,10,23 June 2005,"As a rule, I don't like westerns. This isn't because I'm a city slicker (though now, I do live in a city). I grew up in rural Eastern Oregon where ""real"" cowboys still herd their cattle through the center of town in John Day, Oregon. My stepfather owned a 10,170 acre cattle ranch. After being raised among ""real"" cowboys, the Hollywood versions tend to leave me flat. The Big Country was an exception.Jim McKay (Gregory Peck) introduced us to a different kind of man, far different than most stereotypical men of the Wild West. If I were to compare McKay's character to any other film character, it would be Ghandi. He's a man who doesn't feel obliged to seek the approval of others ... a man who believes that violence doesn't need to be used to solve problems. His secret ride of Old Thunder, making Ramon (Alfonso Bedoya) swear to keep quiet regardless of the outcome, set the tone for McKay's character. His later secret fight with Steve Leech (Charleton Heston), making him swear to keep quiet regardless of the outcome, cemented that tone. This was a REAL man whose opinion of himself was not dependent upon anyone else's opinion ... in stark contrast to anyone else in the film outside of Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons). As Ramon said, ""Such a man is very rare.""Outside of McKay, my #2 favorite character in the film was Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives). I found nothing about him distasteful considering he was a character whose back was against the wall ... whose livelihood was threatened. The things he did make perfect sense in such a situation. His only flaw was his obvious poor parenthood. He really blew it with Buck (Chuck Connors) and Buck's siblings were of the same ilk.I'm so glad that MGM/UA finally released the widescreen version in 2001. This is a film that deserves such a presence. It may not be playing in theaters anymore but seeing it in any other display size takes so much away from it. I've seen the pan/scan version before and will never go back.One note. The full listing of writing credits for the film adaptation is lacking. ""Ambush In Blanco Canyon,"" originally serialized in a magazine, was later novelized into ""The Big Country"" by Donald Hamilton ... and Hamilton also worked on the adaptation as well as Leon Uris (""Topaz,"" ""Exodus,"" ""Gunfight At the OK Corral,"" etc.).This epic film was not lacking for anything. It had the best writers, the best actors, the best musical score, and the best scenery of any other film of its time ... western or otherwise. And the film remains one of my favorite films of all time.",The Big Country
79,elcoat,A profound and humanly instructive as well as great entertaining Western.,10,11 July 2015,"This is a great, expansive ... and quite profound ... Western.On its message boards, someone has raised the question as to whether Pat's idolization of her father the Major may been ... to an unnatural extreme. But the foreman Leech (Charlton Heston) would have known if it had been, and that would have destroyed his own idolization of the Major and probably his romantic interest in Pat, so no I don't think it was that ... although my skin crawls too during that one scene where Pat (Carolyn Baker) upbraids McKay (Gregory Peck) for not being (like) her father.I know a girl who is quite like Pat. She is/was a farm girl from farming country who had lost her father at a young age. After marrying, she was unhappy in her husband's town and moved back to her home locale. The husband followed for their little son to have his father.Suddenly, the hushand could do no right. He was not especially mechanical, and that was just one of the complaints. Her family had told him he was kind. She was NOT and was instead quite stupid and insensitive and downright mean - note the correlation.By contrast McKay and Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) *are* VERY intelligent and sensitive and nice. They immediately like each other, but try to deny their mutual attraction.In two ways McKay is out of his element. He is a long way from the sea, and he is a good, intelligent person who comes to a place of bitter, internecine competition.But he *is* above the strife, and yes he's condescending, because he soon realizes that it's not just the Hannasseys who are the savages, and he's repelled. In fact, old Rufus shows far greater gentility and humanity than The Major.Burl Ives' performance is one of the most vivid and memorable in film history. He fully earned his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.And Chuck Connors played his part as his vicious son well too ... to the point I am surprised it didn't destroy his career. (And yet you can see how condemnatory Rufus may have made him that way.) Ironically, Connors went on to portray a fine father on TV in The Rifleman.The Big Country does attack patriarchies.",The Big Country
80,carflo,Perfect,10,30 October 2003,"Every once and awhile, a movie comes along that is so near to being perfect than any change, no matter how small, would diminish it.  Well, that's The Big Country. It has three of my favorite actors:  Jean Simmons, Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston in parts that they were born to play. It has Burl Ives in a knock your socks off performance as the noble patriarch of an ignoble tribe. It has Chuck Conners in one of the lowest, slimiest, meanist characters in modern westerns. It has the big country - and unless you have seen this movie, you can't understand what that means.  The land itself is a character in this movie. It is the object of veneration, love and lust for four of the major characters:  Charles Bickford, Carroll Baker (sp?), Charlton Heston and Burl Ives. And it has the music.  The music is as big and as beautiful as the country and as perfect as all the performances. If you have never seen it, please do.  You will not regret it.",The Big Country
81,NewInMunich,"Preaching Peace, but gripping when fists or bullets flying",7,3 September 2005,"This has always been a perfect time killer for me, also the plot and its resolution is known and clear for long. Gregory Peck as a peaceful and held-back retired sea captain (not so terribly credible) looking to take Carol Baker as his wife, being viewed as a coward by his potential father in law and his foreman on the ranch, played by Charlton Heston, but proving and courage several times with a strong effort to keep it secret. But actually dominating the show are the two old men, who's ego is even bigger then the country they want to reign about, Burl Ives and Charles Bickford, all the way until they shoot it out eye to eye to settle the score for good. Also great as Burl Ives big mouthed son, but actually turning out to be a coward is Chuck Connors in a role that takes as much ego suppression as you could imagine. Big Noise, big shooting, strong action sound much louder then the words of peace and the quiet scenes, especially between Peck and Jean Simmons.

The score by Jerome Moross is perfection, and my personal favorite of all the great western movie scores.  All the actors/actresses are a perfect fit for their roles, and the male cast of Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors (who shines as the thoroughly bad Buck Hannassey) is ensemble acting at it's best.

83,wlb,One of my favorite westerns - and the music!,8,11 February 2010,"I have learned a bit more about The Big Country since the recent death of Jean Simmons, who played Julie Maragon. Gregory Peck was also a producer in addition to director Wm Wyler, and they had a big falling out over one of the opening scenes, where the buckboard is shown coming up to the Terrill house against the huge backdrop of - The Big Country.Peck stormed off back to Los Angeles from the set,filmed up in Stockton, CA - 300 miles north. He didn't come back on the set for 3 days.20 years later Wyler was receiving an award and Peck came up to congratulate him - whereupon Wyler said ""I'm still not redoing that scene!"" But of course all that is neither here nor there as to why I like the movie.The music is still played 52 years after the premier - when these days ""Best Music"" is won by such titles as ""It's Hard Being A Pimp"" or something similar, Jerome Moross wrote music that not only fit the movie but will be remembered long after I and you, the reader, are gone.The cinematography is beautiful as is the plot and the subplots. There's the main plot of Peck and Carrol Baker, the subplots of Burl Ives and Bickford, Simmons and Baker, Peck and Simmons...This was one of Wyler's masterpieces.The Big Country is on my short list of ""Best Westerns""....",The Big Country
84,jbirtel,"Epic! in Stars, Scope, Music, Direction! Polished in Every Way!",10,29 June 2002,"(Subtle Spoilers)A Gunfight! A Brawl! A Feud! And above all...a Fantastic Love Story! You'd expect a gunfight in a western...but not like this. A western feud is traditional, but it's normally between the ranchers and sodbusters...not here! The brawl is usually a result of the empty vessel called 'honor'...but honor gets a kick right where it belongs. And one of the finest love stories ever told (in a western? where two exceptional leading ladies get above the title billing) even though the destined lovers never exchange an on-screen kiss. But because it's Gregory Peck and Jean Simmons, the look in their eyes are so full of love and understanding, the Look is enough for us. And all surrounded by an all star cast, guided by three time Oscar winning director William Wyler (does he still hold the record for actor/actresses receiving more nominations/Oscars than any other director?) all giving three dimensional performances and enveloped in a vast, sweeping, western landscape.This is one of my all time personal favorites, and for good reason. It is a very mature telling of the genre that's appropriate for all members of the family (ironically makes a great date movie too). And it's not afraid to make constant left turns that succeed so well and be so patient in letting the story unfold in such a majestic way.Charlton Heston is at his peak under Wyler. Carroll Baker has the thankless task as the unsympathetic 'Pat Terril'; she's perfect! Burl Ives vs. Charles Bickford; as symbols of men in power who play so ruthlessly with innocent lives in their lust for hate. Alfonso Bedoya as steadfast ally; and Chuck Conners as the nasty, misguided 'Buck'; all being exceptional.There is so much to admire about this film: the many patterns of ""twos"" that is laced thru-out. Buck tells Julie ""I'll be back"" after intruding on her, and he does (oh boy, does he!). Jim telling Pat ""I think I'm going to like Julie"" when finding her absent from Julie's parlor where Pat is staying. not realizing what fate has in store. And much more!I do prefer the laser disc over the dvd, not only because the laser has so much extras, but they also took time to restore the negative used in the laser transfer that is curiously lacking on the dvd...this film deserved more attention. And do NOT watch this unless it's widescreen!And the music! THE CLASSIC WESTERN MUSIC! To end all westerns (right along side Elmer Bernsteins classics).

85,RodReels-2,Satisfying on Many Levels,8,26 March 2000,"The elements are familiar, but the acting is terrific.  And Williams Wyler's use of the screen makes this a very satisfying drama.  Note the use of the widescreen images each time men begin to fight over their petty egos and jealousies.  Burl Ives deserved his Oscar, especially considering he played Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" that same year.  Oh, and yes, that familiar music is terrific too.",The Big Country
86,henry-girling,A Big Film,9,22 December 2003,"There are many things to enjoy in 'The Big Country'. The landscape itself is a character that seems overwhelming. There are many panoramic shots of it, sweeping out to a misty horizon. All beautifully photographed. This big country seems to glow and the film gets an appropriate music score, sweeping and colourful. It must be one of the most perfect film scores written.In this breathtaking landscape the story of the characters unfold with their prides, jealousies, fears, loves, pretensions, hopes, disappointments. The actors are first rate and convey lots of feeling not just in dialogue but in looks. It is worth seeing more than once to catch the emotional nuances. This is a film with space in lots of senses and it gives the cast time to flesh out their characters. In all the splendid acting I have a particular admiration for Chuck Connors in a performance of a lifetime.  His Buck Hennassey is a coward and a bully yet you can't help feeling sorry for him in the end.There is also the political undertones, the oft quoted Cold War parallels, embodied in the confrontation between Bickford and Ives of mutually assured destruction, that was an ever present issue in the late fifties. Bickford and Ives have narrow self interested vision that portends destruction, while the Peck character has a wider view of co-operation and fairness. (In an illuminating exchange at the engagement party a guest asks Peck if he has seen anything bigger than the 'big country' and Peck replies to the guest's astonishment that he has, a couple of oceans!) It is the outsider who sees clearest.William Wyler was a great director and made a great film to be enjoyed on many levels. It is an aural and visual treat but the film also has believable characters performed by a superior cast. And I can't stop humming that theme tune....",The Big Country
87,SixtusXLIV,"Looks like a Western, but actually is anti-American",9,7 August 2009,"As most as you know William Wyler was a Jew Born in Austria. He tried hard to understand the American mentality. if such thing exists. The Americans liked that and gave him 4 Oscars. But his view of the West it not the standard view. Why?1 - The hero is not a hot-headed, trigger fast American of the westerns...HE is someone like British Navy's Admiral Nelson, with the exception that Nelson did not went ashore into the desert of Egypt, because his crew of sailors would die of disease or Napoleon's army.. This man is a strategist. Most American's (even Today, Warren Buffett excepted) are not.2-It shows that Americans, have no moral values.. This is illustrated mainly by the opportunistic acts of Pat Terril (Carrol Baker, very well directed) and the sensible,strong and resistant behaviour of Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) which is a grand-dougther of a Spaniard).3 - So that no doubts are left, Wyler ends the movie with an Englishman, a Spanish descendant woman and a Mexican humble servant as winners.Rightly so, Mr Wyler.

89,k844140,A great film which is not as popular as it should be,9,11 August 2021,"This film is one of the best around 3-hours-long films about old America I've ever seen. Maybe Gone with the WInd is more valuable, but The Big Country is still a masterpiece and is comparable to the ones like Giant and The Wild Bunch. Moreover, it has something that other monumental pictures don't have. It is the film's ideas, which are quite innovative for the 50s movies. The most of them are connected with Gregory Peck's character. He stands out of the bunch of typical good guys we've seen in westerns and other long movies. I like his attitude to the uselessness of fights and other kinds of conflicts, his unwillingness to prove something to his future wife, and that he's no coward as many people think of him. If all the people would be like him, we would have a much better world. The other great character is Jean Simmons' one. She looks wise and clever, and is for sure the best female character in this film. She looks as the best wife for Peck's McKay and it's a pity we don't see whether they'll be together or not in the end of the picture. Carroll Baker's heroine on the contrary shows us a typical girl who wants to see her husband constantly fighting and risking his life for nothing. Nevertheless, her character is well-represented and played. So are the other characters. For instance, Charlton Heston is a typical bully, who changes in the end realising that violence is not the way. Chuck Connors performed a typical coward who only behaves as he's a tough guy, but basically he isn't. The two fathers' lines show us that conflicts are caused by a few men because of which others suffer. To sum up I can say that every character who does at least anything in the movie is perfectly written and performed. Directing, music, camera work, scenery and locations are as good as actors and characters. The Big Country is surely a must-see and a masterpiece.",The Big Country
90,sissoed,"Interesting characters, could have been better",7,14 December 2006,"This film has complex, real characters, excellent acting, very Shakespearean feel, but I agree with some other commentators that there is something missing at the end. I think it is that none of the deaths at the end really matter. A sniveling coward is shot to keep him from murdering another man; then two bitter, greedy men with an old feud kill each other. Was it a shame that any of these men died? And what happens to the feud? Here's suggestions for how it could have been better. First, give the Major, the gentlemanly cattleman, an admirable background -- hero in the Civil War, admired civic leader some years ago, whatever. When McKay, the sea captain (Peck), meets the Major's daughter in the east, he knows of the Major's admirable history. People in Baltimore praised the Major to him, and that's how he met the daughter. But years ago, after the Major came out West to start this ranch, he started to turn small, greedy, vindictive. Maybe his wife died, maybe there was some other disappointment. He has taken out his bitterness on the Burl Ives character, allowing a minor annoyance or misunderstanding some years ago to fester and grow. Ives has reacted with hurt and bitterness in return -- he knows the slight, whatever it was, doesn't justify this animosity, so he attributes it to snobbery. With this back-story provided to the audience -- it would only take a few lines to put it into the film, maybe delivered by a couple of people at the engagement party -- both old men become more complex, more understandable, more tragic in their confrontation. Then the movie plays out just as it is, until the end, the showdown in Blanco canyon to rescue the Jean Simmons character. The Major's daughter, who has always really been in love with her father, rides out after them, thinking that the captured woman, when rescued, may well want the company of a woman (the subtext here being, if Simmons has been raped during the kidnapping, she will need a woman to be there after the rescue). She arrives just as the final show-down between her father and Ives is about to happen. With her usual immature frontier desire that men fight for honor, she urges her father on to kill Ives -- and, of course, her father not only kills Ives, but is killed. As she is hysterical over his body -- she was too immature to really imagine that her father could die -- Heston sees it, and realizes that he doesn't love or want her any more -- he sees she is in love with her father, and also, he sees she is immature, and has the vicious streak her father had, and so he sees she is really a person he no longer wants to love. She sees the look on Heston's face, and then she sees McKay (Peck) with Simmons obviously in love, and suddenly she realizes that she has lost Peck, lost her father, and lost Heston, all at once. In the space of just a day or two, she has gone from having three men in love with her to having no-one in love with her -- and she herself has been the cause of losing all three loves. We see the bitterness harden in her and we realize that she, the heiress of her father's ranch, will continue his bitter reign, bitter against both Ives' family, and Peck & Simmons. Then bring Ives' younger son into the scene, the young man who will inherit Ives' ranch, upset that his father is dead, blaming the Major, blaming the Major's daughter who urged the Major to kill Ives his father, and blaming Peck and Simmons for the earlier death of his cowardly older brother. As the movie ends we see Peck and Simmons united, which feels wonderful, but we also see that the animosity between the clans is going to continue into the next generation, with both warring sides also blaming Peck and Simmons, the ones in the middle -- literally in the middle, since their ""Big Muddy"" ranch is the source of water for the cattle of both clans. Something like this would provide the movie with the emotional pay-off that the movie lacks as it is. It needs to be tragic that the Major dies as he does, an admirable men destroyed for nothing due to a vindictive flaw in his character. It needs to be tragic that his daughter goes from having three men who love her, to none. And it needs to be tragic that the feud will live on into the next generation. Or, alternatively, the movie needs to show that the feud will end with these deaths -- that the Major's daughter has learned, and matured, and that Ives' heir has also learned and matured. One or the other outcome needs to be in the movie. Ignoring the next generation, leaving open what happens to the feud, leaves an emotional hole in the story. Sometimes I read a comment on a book or film and it says ""The story would have been better if X, Y, or Z had happened in the story."" My reaction to these kind of comments is, hey, it's a work of fiction, not a fact history. Just because the author didn't think of those improvements is no reason why you can't treat the story as having been told in that better way. You can act as though the story had in fact been told the way you think would be better -- just imagine for yourself that it was told that way. So for those of who who like the changes I just proposed, try imagining that this ending was actually in an alternative version of the movie you saw. If that gives you the emotional experience you seek, why not try it?",The Big Country

There are so many good lessons about life that can be learned by watching this film that would result in better citizens of the USA. Some people are not smart enough to add 2 and 2. A sea Captain, who sails the oceans of the world for a living getting lost on a cross country horse ride in the 'Big Country' and they can't figure out on their own that he can find his way anywhere he wants to with his compass. When he won't fight in front of everyone he's deemed a coward, But he'll fight when it suits him. He won't ride a horse when he knows they'll make a laughing spectacle of him, but he'll do it on his own and in is own time. The line delivered by Jean Simmons to Carroll Baker, 'How many times does he have to win your love?', is classic and telling. Burl Ives being trod upon by the so called socialite, big shot, Charles Bickford. More class conscious than considerate to another human being. When Burl Ives is more honorable to a fault and shoots and kills his own son for not being an honest honorable person himself. That's character to a fault. But he warned him.

93,Cue-ball,Anti-western in the tradition of High Noon,8,29 March 2000,"The previous comments describe the virtues of this movie, which certainly bears repeat viewing, widescreen if possible (it has been shown on TCM in widescreen).  I wanted to add that this movie is really not a traditional western.  Unlike the typical western hero, (Gregory Peck) abhors gratuitous displays of violence or braggadocio, but is willing to take up challenges to prove things to himself, not others.  Some view him as a coward, but others realize that he is truly the bravest man standing.  The distinctions between the Hannassays and the Terrills are not that clear, either.  In the last analysis, both are really after the same thing and will do whatever it takes to get it -- and keep it from the other.  This movie is a re-examination of the genre that began with High Noon and the Searchers, and was continued in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Unforgiven.  This is not just a great movie, but an important one as well.",The Big Country
94,john_seater,One of the best Westerns ever,10,4 January 2015,"I love Westerns. Even so, most of them are weak to terrible, and most of the rest are fair to middlin' at best. I watch most of those that are fair or better anyway because they are fun. Most of them stop there. Few have a deeper element than pure fun. Some, though, really stand out in that regard, and ""The Big Country"" is one of them. It is fun but also thoughtful and interesting.""The Big Country"" isn't an action movie. There is action in several places, but action is neither the strength nor the point of the film. If an action flick is what you want, this isn't a movie you will like much. Instead, this movie is about character and plot development. The characters are interesting, and the plot is good. Both the characters and the plot take unexpected turns, which I will leave unexplained here so you can discover them for yourself. The cast is outstanding. Even the secondary characters are portrayed by first-rate actors, all of whom turn in strong performances. The directing is equally outstanding. The Western setting provides a good excuse to add enjoyable action to the movie. It's a fine package.I have watched ""The Big Country"" several times. I'm sure I will watch it again one of these days. Even though I know what is coming in all the important scenes, I still find them entertaining and captivating. That's a testament to the directing, acting, and writing.The ending is slightly weak (just a little too predictable). It's the only part of the movie with any hint of weakness, though, and it detracts little from the film. I recommend this movie most highly.",The Big Country
95,campbell-russell-a,A man like him is very rare,9,16 June 2012,"Alfonso Bedoya is rightly remembered for his line in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre - ""Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges."" Just as telling is the way Alfonso articulated the key concept of The Big Country when he says of Jim McKay: ""A man like him is very rare."" There is a sense of respect in Alfonso's delivery and a need to relate to others what he has seen in McKay. There is great irony in the fact that everyone else except for Julie as played by Jean Simmons fails to see McKay's qualities. And they assume superiority in all things related to life in the west. This is a film about prejudice on a number of levels. The Mexican ranch hand, Ramon, is disregarded and even called an idiot by the ranch's owner, Henry Terrill, when he tells him and daughter, Pat, not to worry about McKay going off on his own to explore the ranch. ""I don't think he'll get lost. He's a very smart man. And he's got a funny watch."" Ramon didn't know that the watch was a compass but he knew McKay well enough to be confident that McKay's confidence in the ""funny watch"" would not be misplaced - even in country that ""looks all the same"". The Hannassey boys mistook McKay's forbearance for cowardice. This was to be expected of them because they were young and foolish so McKay is understanding of it. However, when the woman who has declared her love for him construes his forbearance as cowardice, it is another matter. Julie asks Pat, ""How many times does a man have to win you?"" Exactly! McKay does not need to live out a lifetime of proving himself to others and a man like that is very rare. For most of us, we live lives in which what we own or what we do just have to be acknowledged over and over. Worse still, we often forget that people like Ramon are not idiots simply because they are uneducated ""ranch hands"" or express views that don't coincide with our own. The messages so skilfully hidden within a film about a grudge match between two old tyrants in the wild west are a testament to the screenwriter's craft.",The Big Country
96,v_haritha_in,A Movie Full of Old Fashioned Charm,9,19 July 2014,"James McKay (Peck), a refined man, comes to a lawless town in the Old West and makes it a better place. It is a very common premise in the Westerns over the decades (Destry Rides Again, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, A Fistful of Dollars). But what make this movie unique are the characters and the way we perceive them over the course of the movie. General Henry Terrill (Bickford)and Rufus Hannassey (Ives) are the heads of two rival families in town. Terrill is rich, well-spoken and has a beautiful daughter, Patricia (Baker), who is engaged to McKay. Hannassey is poor and rough and has three ruffians for sons. But, we soon discover that appearances are deceptive. General Terrill, Rufus Hannassey, Patricia and Steve Leech (Heston), the General's foreman, are all products of their environment and have their own good and bad qualities. Even McKay is not perfect; though his is more of a weakness (he is not very good at judging) his feelings for women. The spectrum of characters also include Julie Maragon (Simmons), a young lady caught in the feud and yet managed to stay strong and keep her values, and Buck Hannassey (Connors), Rufus's slithery elder son with no redeemable qualities. A couple of characters alter their way of seeing things after their interaction with McKay but they never go out of their personalities. And, the romance has a modern day touch to it.A description of the movie would not be complete without mentioning its three excellent fight scenes. They are entirely different from one another in style, context and purpose and add depth to the movie.The cast could not be better. The locations are well chosen and convey the idea that we are indeed in a ""big country"". And, there is not a dull moment in spite of its length. A must watch for fans of Westerns.",The Big Country

You get two great leading men in Peck & Heston, Two great character actors with Ives and Bickford with Ives brilliant as rough and dirty Rufus and two beautiful leading ladies with Simmons & Baker along with Conners as Ives simple minded rowdy son. Every scene with Ives is unforgettable. Pure entertainment at its best and unlikely to be equaled in a western again.",The Big Country
98,matchettja,"Big country, people and emotions",9,8 July 2006,"""Big"" describes not only the country, but also the people in it and their emotions, which are often expressed nonverbally. We see love, understanding, excitement, fear, rage, jealousy, shame, disapproval and more through facial expression. One of the highlights is the look two major characters exchange showing the love each has for the other, never before expressed. Neither of them speaks a word, but they understand clearly enough. I won't get into a detailed summary of the plot as that can be found elsewhere. Instead I would like to focus on a few of the lesser scenes, non-essential but adding to the overall flavor as, for example, the cowboy rousted out of his sleep and being so disoriented that he nearly climbs on his horse backwards. Or the cowboy who puts on a display of terrific horsemanship trailing behind his horse at full gallop holding on only by the tail. Or the father encouraging his son's romantic aspirations with the words, ""Treat her right. Take a bath sometimes."" One of the major criticisms is that the movie is too long, but it is difficult for me to find even a line that could be cut without losing something. As for the characters, Gregory Peck's sea captain Jim McKay is my second favorite of his roles, behind only Atticus Finch of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". He is a man of great inner peace and strength, uncaring about what others think of him. He desires peace, but he will not back down from a fight if no other choice is left to him. Equally impressive is Jean Simmons as schoolteacher Julie Maragon. Also peace loving, she refuses to sell her land, which contains the only water for miles around, to either one of two feuding families who would cut water off from the other should they get their hands on that land. Other major characters include ranch owner Major Terrell (Charles Bickford), bent on the destruction of his rival Rufus Hannassey, his daughter Pat (Carroll Baker), engaged to McKay but in reality in love with her father, and foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston), fiercely loyal to his boss, in love with his daughter and intensely jealous of her fancy fiancé from back east. Alfonso Bedoya, in his final role, stands out, as does Chuck Conners as Rufus' cowardly son, Buck. However, it is Burl Ives as the blunt, coarse, but principled head of the Hannassey clan who towers over everyone else. He got the Academy Award and deservedly so. One final note: the music score by Jerome Moross is nothing short of magnificent. The movie critics got it all wrong on this one. It is neither too long in running time nor too short on action. It is as it should be, an American epic.",The Big Country
99,ptrsknnr,Love it!,10,24 January 2021,"Watching this second time round. At a running time of 166 mins this would have to be a top 5 western..Gregory as always shines,Jean Simmons is gorgeous......great plot...beautiful cinematography....worth a look...especially on 4k screen",The Big Country
100,enthusiast,A great musical score!,8,17 January 2002,"I have recently moved to Lithuania from Wyoming so I am familiar with the American West and it's settings. This film is very good by itself, but should be considered excellent due to it's great musical score. That is what sets this movie apart from most other Westerns.",The Big Country
101,ksneath,One of the best FILMS of all time,10,23 February 2007,"I will have to agree with the majority of people here, and I must say I am pleased to see how well received this film is for so many. It is truly deserving. I am at a bit of a loss as to how this film has gotten ""lost"" among many other so-called ""great"" westerns. This film makes a very strong case for my top western (along with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Shootist, and The Searchers), and certainly top 10 movie of all time!There are so many rare and great things about this film -- let me just point to a few. First, the movie, at almost 3 hrs long, has no dull, lagging spots! There is not a scene or a section which you want to ""fast-forward"" through to get to the ""good parts"". This is very unusual for a film of this length.Second, the character development in this film is amazing. Not because the protagonist and the antagonist are developed so well (although they are), but because there are so MANY characters developed to such a great extent. This may well be the reason for the fact in the previous point. Peck, Heston, Conners, Ives, Bickford, Baker, Simmons, and Bedoya, and even Ol' Thunder the horse (!) are interesting, and more than watchable. By the time the film is through, you feel as if you've known each and every one very well!Thirdly, this film effectively does what many try to do and fail (but at which Wyler was very good), and many marginal movies never even attempt. Simply put, half of the dialogue in this movie, isn't. You learn every bit as much about all the characters by their expressions and their actions as by their lines. Brilliant acting, and even more brilliant directing.Fourth, there are many great scenes in this movie! It is not full of non-stop, shoot-em-up, action -- it is so much better than that! The scene at the beginning as Peck gets off the stage is good -- his (eventful) trip to the ranch with his fiancé, the Ol' Thunder showdown, Burl Ives entry (which is AMAZING and powerful!), Peck's trip to the old ranch house and Big Muddy, the fight between Heston and Peck (which some have criticized for the slow pacing, outcome, and distant camera-work, but which I think is poignant, rare, and a turning point in the film), and the list goes on and on...Fifth, as so many have said -- the music is absolutely wonderful! It is powerful, uplifting, and very, very hummable! :-)There are so many things which I love about this film, which are to many to continually elaborate upon. Wyler's treatment of the story and its characters is suburb. Each and every character is true to form throughout without inconsistencies, and each one is powerful in his or her own way. This is a magnificent western for everyone. See it!!",The Big Country
102,TheHG,A Big and Marvelous Movie!!!,10,5 December 1999,"In my opinion, this movie is an American classic because it reflects America's ideals of humor, romance, politics, and individualism albeit in a western setting. The cast is excellent, and the musical score is very memorable and grand. Interestingly, we see dichotomies of... a)personalities, b)social milieus, and c)political beliefs. Gregory Peck plays the thoughtful, gentlemanly, and temperate Jim McKay while his antagonist, the loyal, impetuous, and arrogant Steve Leech is portrayed by Charlton Heston. Both actors are magnificent in their roles. On the other hand, Burl Ives and Charles Bickford are a pair of ""selfish"", ""foolish"" and ""senseless"" rivals that are headed for a range war. As far as the female leads go, we have the sweet and sensible (Jean Simmons) versus the fiery and foolish (Carroll Baker). We see contrasting life styles in the rich and refined versus the somewhat poor and unpolished. As far as politics go, we see the subtleties of the ""law abiding"" taking the law into their own hands and subverting it. Wait a minute! Isn't that still true today?! The Big Country has a great finale, but it still leaves you wishing for more because ""this is a biggg country!""",The Big Country
103,tommythek,They don't make 'em like that anymore.,9,20 October 2001,"And it's true. They don't. Just as the classic musical is no more, so, too, can the same be said for the sprawling western. Yes, ""The Big Country"" was not the last of the great sprawling westerns. It is merely representative of a type of movie no longer made by Hollywood. It is not just Hollywood's loss but everyone's loss. On the surface, the story is not unique. A couple of families fighting over water rights in the Old West, with a love story thrown in for added interest. But put it in the hands of a masterful director such as William Wyler and a movie such as ""The Big Country"" becomes something special. Suddenly, all the characters become bigger than life. The scenes are much bigger than they appear on the screen. The meanings, the dialogue, the twists and turns in the plot, all take on much more meaning than in any ordinary movie. Most important of all, the distinguishing lines between good and evil become blurred, to the point where you're not sure for whom to root and to root against.In ""The Big Country,"" the only thing about which you can be reasonably certain is that James McKay (Gregory Peck) is probably the good guy. Probably. But after him, everyone else is up for grabs. Of the two familial patriarchs, Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford) and Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives), you kind of figure that one of them will change coats and become a good guy in the end. But which one? And how? Then there's Steve Leech (Charlton Heston), Major Terrill's right-hand man. In the world of good/bad guys, he's about ten commandments removed from Moses. But is HE as bad as he seems? Maybe Buck Hannassey (Chuck Conners), Rufus' son, can fulfill the role of the profligate bad boy.Then there are the women. First, there is Patricia Terrill (Carroll ""Baby Doll"" Baker), Henry's daughter. The goodly Jim McKay has given up life as a seafaring captain to come west to marry her so she MUST be good. Mustn't she? And what about Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), owner of Big Muddy, the ranch with the water that is causing all of the disagreeableness between the two feuding families? What role is she going to play in the denouement?This story is played out against a backdrop of spectacular cinematography and is further augmented by the unforgettable score of Jerome Moross. In fact, ""The Big Country"" theme song was one of the most recognizable songs of the late 1950s and for anyone today who is old enough and still alive enough to recall the music of that era, it remains one of the most recognizable movie theme songs of that or any other era.I guess what most impresses me about a movie like ""The Big Country"" is how William Wyler is able to tell such a simple story in such a complex way. Yes, it has great scenery and great music and great actors. But in the end, it's Wyler's storytelling that makes the movie.Yep, when it comes to westerns, they don't make 'em like ""The Big Country"" anymore. But I sure wish they did.",The Big Country
104,spocktom,Yes...very big!,9,21 May 2006,"A well acted and executed western from the brilliant William Wyler. I will not delve into the intricacies of the plot except to say that, western though it is, it speaks much more about what it is, truly, to be a gentleman.The acting from Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Jean Simons (and a special mention for the irrepressible Alfonso Bedoya)et al is of the highest standard, with Peck very much at the helm in this epic of the west.The music soundtrack must rate as one of the most memorable and well-written scores ever created for a western motion picture. Written with skill and care by Jerome Moross it is at once evocative and descriptive and the opening theme is surely one of the most whistled tunes ""out west"".The DVD print is optically quite good. The widescreen photography is superb. Disappointingly the soundtrack has not been re-mixed into 5.1 and has been left in single-track Dolby 1.1. Hopefully there will be a ""special release' version in the future that will address this minor shortcoming.",The Big Country
105,lgilbertom,One the bests western ever made (minor spoilers),9,22 September 2003,"This movie is one the best westerns ever made. This movie is about honor and about how a man can make himself.

Outstanding cast, Peck, Heston, Simmons, Ives, Connors, all give outstanding and memorable performances. Perfect score, perfect pace, which is very hard to do in a three hour movie.If you really look back at the Western genre they made a LOT of very bad to mediocre movies, some good ones, and a very few great ones.

108,jack.hunter,Wonderful movie.,10,13 June 2000,"Absolutely stunning western with an all star cast.  Sometimes an all star cast is assembled just for drawing power, but not so here.  All of the characters are well cast and have well developed roles.  Burl Ives is absolutely mesmerizing in a masterful performance.  The exchanges between he and Chuck Connors are riveting.  This movie is full of memorable dialog but it is worth the price of admission just to see the scene where Burl Ives crashes the party.  Small wonder he won an Oscar for his performance.  All performances are uniformly outstanding and the soundtrack is a true classic. One of my favorite films.  If you have seen ""Treasure Of The Sierra Madre"" you will want to watch for Alfonso Bedoya as Ramon in this film.  In case you are wondering why I mention this think of the phrase ""we don't need no stinking badges"".  Yep, he is the one who said it.",The Big Country
109,revtg1-2,A man with enough self-confidence to bear hunt with a BB gun.,10,13 October 2007,"Burl Ives has all the best lines and he doesn't waste a one. Chuck Connors plays a slimy weasel and makes you believe he IS one. All the cast is strong except Carroll Baker. Poor girl never did learn how to act, but she tries. Gregory Peck is his usual no-nonsense character, from the steel spine school of Frank Lovejoy and George C. Scott. His soft talk and quiet demeanor leads Charlton Heston's character to believe him weak and timid. Peck adroitly side steps all the challenges until he picks the time and the place for a showdown. What can one say about Jean Simmons? One could watch that beauty and grace with the sound off. AND she's a great actress. A story of a man who steps into what is to him a totally alien world and decides not to become a part of it. Instead he forces it to come to his terms by proving nothing to anyone except to himself. When the people who have damned him for a pantie waist realize he is stronger than all of them, they clamor for his favor. He smiles in amusement and walks away. What a story. If you love westerns and you haven't seen this one I envy you. I'd like to see it again for the first time.",The Big Country
110,fs3,"Epic in character, not simply budget or ""history""",7,3 January 2001,"The Big Country has long been underrated in discussions of some other, rather overblown two-and-a-half-hour plus westerns of the 50's and 60's. Unlike many others, this one is rich in character, not just another lesson in ""it's in Cinerama/Super Panavision and historical, so it's gotta be good.""The cast is smaller than some spot-the-star epics and couldn't have been better chosen; what few people remember in amongst the always commanding Gregory Peck lead, the talented female duo of Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker, and the vivid feud-masters Burl Ives, Charles Bickford and Chuck Connors, is that Charlton Heston gave one of his best performances here.Not to say that the visuals aren't striking here; the technical work stands up to and often surpasses the big Westerns of the era.  Good news for fans and never-seens: the movie was recently announced for release in stereo and widescreen on DVD in the next couple of months: an overdue treat of a movie ready for discovery (or rediscovery.)",The Big Country

My favorite genre is Western, but it qualifies as a classic movie...period!  The actors are superb.  Peck, Heston, Ives, Bickford, Connors, Simmons, etc. stand out in their characterizions and, as a previous writer mentioned, were at the apex of their careers.  The dialogue, scenery, and story are first rate.  The musical score by Jerome Moross is as memorable as the the theme of the Magnificent Seven.

113,LeeRoss1,A Great Film,9,14 October 2007,This film has a stunning opening sequence with credits by the great Saul Bass and one of the most beautiful scores ever composed. The performances a outstanding and William Wyler's direction is simply first rate. It is one of the most underrated movies from the 1950's and is a perfect example of why Gregory Peck was one of the biggest stars of his time. The story may be far-fetched at the end but overall this is a western that should not be missed by anyone serious about film. The credits alone are worth the viewers time and the visuals are unforgettable. Even Chuck Connors does a fine job and Charlton Heston is excellent. The fight sequence between Peck and Heston truly shows the futility of violence and the scenes of humanity dwarfed by the natural environment are superb.,The Big Country
114,lantern4444,A Grand Western,8,11 May 2018,"A great western. A wealthy man from the east arrives in the West to start a new life. The theme of the movie is set when he encounters many issues including difficulties with the locals and his fiances family. The movie develops the main character well showing that whilst he appears to have no spirit, his own beliefs and experience eventually come forth. The movie culminates when his own convictions and values are put to the test. The main characters relationship with those around him also develops when they find that their initial evaluations were wrong. The movie falls down in the sense that the romances are simply contrived and the motives of the women need more depth. The ending of the movie is a disappointment as I am not a fan of simple face offs.The movie has great acting from the noted actors and actresses Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Carroll Baker, Charles Heston, Burl Ives and Charles Bickford. The cinematography was excellent showing grand vistas of both open country and enclosed canyons. It also portrays very well the simple towns and ranches of the lawless frontier. The story line is unusual in showing a different approach of tact and understanding against direct violence. Definitely worth watching by all.",The Big Country
115,rkersh,One of my favorite films of all time,10,25 November 2007,"I always tell anyone who listens that Gregory Peck never made a bad film. The Big Country is one of his best and one I have watched over and over. As of this writing it is being run by WETA in the widescreen version and I have watched it twice in the last 2 daze . . .I read a lot of the comments of my fellow admirers and there seems to be a consensus that this movie has few if any weaknesses. Nearly every comment mentions the musical score and the great cast. The unforgettable Burl Ives in his Oscar winning role, Charleton Heston, Carol Baker, Charles Bickford, Chuck Conners and Jean Simmons . . . what a beauty! Until this go 'round I had never given much thought to the location of the story. I figured The Big Country was an obvious reference to The Big Sky country of Montana or at least Wyoming. Since I have been to Texas it would be easy to assume the location was there, especially the cattle ranches and dry canyons. Thanx to IMDb I now know the film was shot in California, another place I have lived and noticed the ranches.The one overriding thing about this movie that I always felt was that it should have been a mini-series and should have gone on and on. It was a story you could put yourself into and who wouldn't have wanted to be James McKay falling in love with Julie Maragon played by the great Jean Simmons. Bravo!",The Big Country

All this set against stunning and unique scenery with one of the most iconic western soundtracks ever written. If it HAD been a musical it sure would have had some good songs.

117,John Jennings,This great movie has been curiously overlooked.,10,26 June 2002,"I recently caught this on AMC or TCM, and it is so good it just blew me away!It is a MUST to see this in Wide Screen format on DVD on a fairly big TV. The edited screen VHS loses about 40 % of the impact.This is an ALL STAR cast, with great performances all around. Burl Ives is my favorite in his Oscar winning role as a crotchety old head of a back canyon cattle clan.This is a classic well-written story from the pen of Donald Hamilton. (His legacy of the superb Matt Helm character is permanently confused in most minds by the forgettable Hollywood Matt Helm films made by Dean Martin.) But this story is a masterwork by Hamilton. In the Old West, it often came down to water rights, cattle and women, and that's when the trouble starts.Gregory Peck is great in his usual role as a man with almost as much integrity as God. Charlton Heston is dynamic, yet masterfully understated in his role as ranch ramrod (He doesn't steal the show). Jean Simmons is the desirable, yet cool schoolmarm in a flawless performance. I didn't recognize Carol Baker until I saw the credits, playing daddy's girl to the hilt. There are also great performances by Charles Bickford as ""the Major"", and Chuck Conners as the Burl Ives characters fatally flawed son.""The Big Country"" is superbly photographed, and makes one think of the later black and white film ""Hud"".This film seems to be under appreciated, but should be on anybody's list of the Top Ten Westerns of all time.

From the plots, dialogue, cast and filming this movie is hard to beat. Looking at all the Oscar nominees for 1958 it is my belief that this movie should have won more. Charleton Heston and Jean Simmons gave exceptional performances. Gregory Peck also was excellent. The entire cast could not be duplicated just like trying to remake the ""Magnificent Seven"". The bar was set too high. The music is epic and equal to the Grand Canyon Suite. I don't give out ""10"" easily but I lean towards it on this movie. Made in the late 50's this is amazing what Hollywood could do back then without all the HD CG of todays movies. This is a ""pure"" film.",The Big Country

Heck, Charlton Heston actually bothers to act in this movie and is quite good. And Jean Simmons is lovely beyond words. But I never realized how outstanding the direction was until I saw it in wide-screen. It looked like a whole new movie. The shot composition, the camera movement -- it is simply awesome. And William Wyler is smart enough to keep a pace that is very deliberate and never, ever hurried. I wish a lot of today's film makers would watch this movie and see how effective it can be to hold shots and let emotion develop, instead of incessantly cutting for frenetic effect.",The Big Country

123,BoomquifaSchartzmugel,Could be the best western ever.,10,26 July 2019,"The Big Country could be the best western ever, at least the best I've seen, and it does deliver the epic of an epic category movie. What is great about The Big Country is its, as if, Biblical or Shakespearean depth as a moral lesson, its expansive motif of good versus evil, down to the level of men's conflicted hearts, the right way versus the wrong way to go about life, of depth of character versus shallow character, the high road versus the low road, all among ordinary people, most of which you'd not call criminals, a movie about real and important stuff, of real life to us all. Without spoiling anything, let's just say Gregory Peck, as the character James McKay, is a classic example of a Christ-figure, novel plot device, well used, wisdom to contrast the folly of self-willed mankind against.The Big Country isn't a shoot 'em up for the sake of the spaghetti in a spaghetti western, is not about who's the quickest draw. Nobody puts a hole dead-center in a silver dollar with their pistol, that somebody threw in the air a hundred yards away. Don't expect James McKay, in the end, to have shot every other soul in the script stone dead, but for his sidekick. What you can expect is a profound story, with some important lessons, a movie that, in any setting, is worth experiencing and learning from. Must mention, as great a composer as Ennio Morricone is truly capable of being, you will neither suffer a score, which you must presume is supposed to somehow relate to the old west, being played on an electric guitar, from an echo chamber. The music is, actually, as rich and first rate as the story.Don't get me wrong, as spaghetti westerns and others such can be a real hoot, that hold your attention well, but this movie is, again, truly profound. Also, I don't think there could have been a more perfect casting of James McKay than Gregory Peck, a role that spelled Gregory Peck, to work his gentlemanly charm on. In addition, Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker were perfect fits, the woman of deep character, love and maturity, versus the pretentious and shallow, down to their looks. Charlton Heston was neither shabby as the uppity ranch hand, just looking like he was waiting to explode (Charlton Heston could do that wild-eyed, rumbling volcano guy well), his character at times menacing and convincingly so, though not a devil, at heart: still, leaves you a bit melancholy, seeing Moses behaving so badly, at times. You even get the rare appearance of Alfonso Bedoya, in a genial role, where he wouldn't go ballistic over stinking badges, if the subject came up, anyway. (RE: For the benefit of such as Gen Xers or Millennials, suffering cultural deprivations born of historical ignorance? The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. If you've not seen this truly great film with Alfonso, turn off The Big Bang Theory, and watch it. Now!)Do give The Big Country a try, if you'd like to see something with a denouement of more depth than Clint Eastwood heaping a cart full of bodies, only having learned, as the end credits role, how to be fixed for pizzas, for life.",The Big Country

It is also a little slow and ponderous, but like a good play, it builds well and speaks volumes about the human condition. As I write this review in the late summer of 2012, I kind of wish it were possible to return to 1958. The issues of life were no more or less compelling back then; however, there was to them a certain sincerity, and even a hopefulness to life that makes the 21st Century seem like a complete fraud. Strange how little changes over time. This movie was made before the '60s and '70s, and yet it speaks to me (dob 1951) in a soft and somber voice, and reminds me that what we do, we to for God and ourselves.

The story is basically two large ranches on the verge of outright warfare get entangled with an ex-sea captain who arrives to marry a girl that he met ""back East"". Neither of the ranch operations are prepared for him, nor is the girl. I won't go any farther, except to say that this is one of those movies that really should be brought forward. Remade? No, I can't imagine anyone being the Captian other than Gregory Peck. But I suppose that it would ""have"" to be remade to be brought forward. Just make sure that the Captain is a middle aged guy--a young guy won't work. (It took years to become a Captain, right?) Anyway, this is one film that is always a pleasure to watch. One thing that does annoy me about this film is the end. No words are said for about five minutes...and there really should be something said by somebody! But I'm not saying who or what!",The Big Country
132,darcyj,One of the Greatest Westerns,10,20 November 2005,"Alongside ""The Magnificent Seven"", I regard this movie as the greatest of the Western genre. It is a definitive Western, but it is much more than just a Western.A ""definitive"" Western: All the elements are here. Gunfights, fistfights, horseriding, a posse, cattle herding, wide plains and narrow canyons, the frontier town and the wealthy ranch. None of the set-pieces descend into cliché, however, as the rhythm and flow of the narrative carry us from scene to scene without a suggestion of contrivance.Not ""just a Western"": The outback feud over water rights is not a story than can be moved to another setting; nevertheless, in this movie it sets up strong characters played by strong actors. Indeed, ""The Big Country"" is an ironic title, because the movie is about its characters and not the big country itself. Time after time, the story and the Director's touch show us the smallness of the characters in relation to the country - not just the physical size, but the fact that the country controls the people and not vice-versa. Then, in close-set scenes between two or more characters, the story draws out the depth and feeling of the people, and the big country around them is merely incidental to their personality-driven conflict. Naturally, this is the essence of great drama and storytelling, so it is no surprise that the movie earns such admiration.A wonderful element of this film is the musical score, by Jerome Moross, who developed a musical tapestry which perfectly backed up the scene, the characters and the action.For those two or three of you who have not seen this movie, I cannot recommend it highly enough and give you this advice: It will surprise you before the end.",The Big Country
133,reubensong,Pure class!,10,29 July 2012,"Any wannabe film makers of the future should look right here for the ultimate lesson. It seems to me that before technology blasted its way into movie making, more effort went into the craft. Clearly, William Wyler(director) knew a thing or two about vision and elbow grease. Real characters, a good straightforward story line, strong men and beautiful women, and lessons acted out and learnt throughout,not to mention one of the most rousing soundtracks in movie history, make this a classic. Peck is good, as is Simmons and Heston, but it is generally agreed that Burl Ives steels the show. No spoilers in my review, just trust that you will enjoy this film.

Even if you're not a huge Western fan (I'm not), you'll get totally drawn into the story and the acting, not to mention the direction, cinematography, and absolutely phenomenal score.  (I can't believe it didn't bring home the Oscar for Best Dramatic Score--what were the Academy voters thinking??)It's on the long side, but there's not a dull moment from start to finish, and the last half hour features one of the best showdowns ever.  Actually, the movie's chock-full of super showdowns, not the least of which is a literal fistfight between Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston.  Just think of them as settling their political differences.  ;-)I wish they would bring this movie back into the theaters; I can only imagine how much better it would be on the big screen.

It's one of the best I've ever heard and it never fails to captivate me. Everyone writing a comment for this site about their favorite film scores is sharing an incredible list of their personal favorites. They're all magnificent! And the discussion is extremely intelligent and perceptive. One score that everyone seems to have omitted, however, is the music by Victor Young for ""Shane."" Another classic film. The first adult western (as it's often called). The score unequivocally fits into this list of the best. I must admit that there are finer, more elaborate scores. But the music for Shane ""fits."" And it, too, is a musical heritage that other composers have reached to match. Although there are more robust musical compositions for the movies, none is more memorable than ""Eyes of Blue"" from Shane. Victor Young did what he was hired to do -- the true mark of a professional. Young was to provide music that ""fit."" He could have gone ""over the top"" with his effort but he didn't. He helped make this film a classic with music that is subtle and effective and not at all intrusive.",The Big Country
138,DRF,Easily one of the most underrated movies of all-time.,10,28 January 2001,"I've read all of the comments about Wyler's ""The Big Country"".  I don't even remember the first time I saw this movie but I have never tired of watching it. William Wyler went to the vault and pulled out the often used theme, ""the showdown on main street at high noon"" genre that many directors had tired of and felt was the kiss of death to western movies of the day and he pulled it off in grand fashion. Why this movie has never received it's just due has mystified me for years. Maybe the late '50's became the time of the ""brat pak"" movie genre, (""Rebel Without A Cause""), but the performances in this movie are classic. Jean Simmons was absolutely intriguing. As a man watching this movie, I soon realized what Mr. Peck would begin to see in this woman as the movie progressed. Just that little glimpse from Ms. Simmons as she measured up the man she would soon fall in love with had more sexual power than most flicks today that try to thrive on the sexual theme to sell theatre tickets.This is not just a western. It is pure greatness from William Wyler and a cast that added strength to the film. Burl Ives and Charles Bickford played their respective roles with the intenseness and professionalism of a classic Shakespearean play and Charlton Heston was perfect as the antagonist to Gregory Peck. This film has no weakness and has gotten better with time.",The Big Country
139,rondphoto,Don't call it a western,10,12 March 2002,"Those who watch this movie expecting John Wayne/Clint Eastwood style action are usually disappointed.  It isn't a western.  It is a solid character study set in the West.  Jim McKay is an outsider, a true ""fish out of water,"" whose good manners and quiet self-reliance don't settle well with the clans of either Henry Terrill or Rufus Hannassey, two explosive ranchers around whose feud this story revolves.  Of course, the feud finally leads to a bloody confrontation, but viewer interest for the duration of the movie is maintained through the continuing attempts by McKay to integrate himself into the community without sacrificing his integrity.  Will he become more like them, or they more like him?  What is he finally willing to fight for? Loyalty and honor are themes common to most westerns, and they are present here as well.  However, McKay redefines the terms.  To him, loyalty and honor are not blind alignments with one side or the other. They are the inner battles between right and wrong waged in the heart as a man matures. Pat Terrill (McKay's fiance, thinking him a coward): ""You let him call you a liar.  I've never been so humiliated.  Don't you care what people think?"" McKay: ""No, I'm not responsible for what people think; only for what I am."" This is a film that rewards the patient viewer.STORY  A //// ACTING  A (particularly Chuck Connors and Burl Ives.  Anyone who says Gregory Peck is ""wooden,"" is missing a lot of nuance.) //// EDITING A //// CINEMATOGRAPHY  A++ (superb!!  Example: McKay leaves Julie's porch with the deed; the camera remains still as the Hannasseys come over the distant hill to kidnap her.) //// MUSIC  A++ (three themes used to outstanding effect.

141,SirGEORGE,Boring REALLY boring,5,14 July 2006,"I can't say anything else it's BORING!Well, it's NOT a Clint Eastwood styled ""Spagethi western"" where the Men with no name shoots bad guys, rather a drama, but quite enjoyable. There is NO any good shootout scenes or fights, just some disgusting murders, only for a horse's drinker place. Gregory Peck is a REALLY GOOD actor, but this film is not his best. The music is good, the actors are good, the places are beautiful, but the story is BORING!! John McKay (Gregory Peck) a pacifist ship captain, arrives to a village to marriage the beautiful Patricia Terill (Caroll Baker) the daughter of Major Terill, but He suddenly falls into the old conflict of the Major and Mr. Hannasey. But He doesn't want to fight, because He thinks this is an old, disgusting conflict of two silly old fools. And the end of the film He can't shoot Blakie Hannasey, the evilest guy in town. He's every times a pacifist.I think It's NOT REALLY a western, rather a dramatic soap-opera. If you think this is a ""wild"" western, well it's not. But someone would think ""This is the best western what ever made"", well I think It's not. The Oscar-won music is really good, and really good for this film!To tell the truth I'm not really enjoyed this film, and I will NOT see this again. 4.5/10-boring story, good actors, good music.",The Big Country

And, may I say that after fifty three years I still enjoy Jerome Moross' theme music.I do regret that it was not filmed in Texas where I believe the story took place. Blanco Canyon looked suspiciously like the stage on which many budget westerns were filmed. Westerns that featured Gene Autry, Roy Rodgers, Johnny Mack Brown, etc. Nevertheless, the scenery minus Blanco Canyon was outstanding and the scene where Gregory Peck is leaving Jean Simmons' home while in the background you can see the three Hennessey's who are on a mission to kidnap Jean Simmons was a piece of cinematic excellence.Only the scenes in Blanco Canyon deviated from the theme of a big country. The fight scene between Peck and Heston did a lot to promote the theme that they were indeed in a big country.I will watch this movie over and over again as I will ""Shane,"" ""High Noon,"" and ""The Searchers.""Doufus t",The Big Country

144,medenburn,That score!,10,28 June 2017,"The Big Country is great for so many reasons, but the greatest reason to me has always been Jerome Moross' s magnificent score. From the signature sweeping opening theme to the subtle background for the fight between Gregory Peck and Charleton Heston the music simply amplifies the majesty of the film. One scene in particular leaps out as genius. Early in the film Moross employs a rugged theme for the ""war party"" riding off for some vengeance. Later, when the culminating showdown approaches in Blanco Canyon, Heston and Charles Bickford have a divisive argument that ends with Bickford riding off alone. Listen at this point for the way Moross accompanies Bickford with a simple lead up to the ""war party"" theme. Then, as the contrite Heston rides around a bend in the canyon, Moross adds a more complex second peroration of the theme as Heston joins Bickford. Finally, the rest of the war party gallops around the bend to join their leaders Bickford and Heston as Moross adds all the rest of the musical elements of the ""war party"" theme. The musical moment is simply thrilling!",The Big Country

Seeing it now, however, I thought at first that despite these rather obvious factors it comes across to me as even somewhat ridiculous. The characters seemed like cardboard cutouts, and it seemed as though everything rational was being abandoned in order to make the tension between the opposing factions as irrational as possible. Throughout the first half or more the film has the character of a movie of stereotypes stuck on the screen and carrying out their assigned actions. And I think that criticism holds until the final showdown. Then, the people and their motivations become real and the film lifts itself out of the trite stereotypical and delivers a rationally and emotionally satisfying ending. My conclusion: ""The Big Sky"" holds its own even today.",The Big Country

Burl Ives, who won the Supporting Actor Oscar for this role, is splendid!

Gregory Peck's McKay was an ideal role model for any boy or youth, showing what it really is to be a man. In our culture so much machismo and swagger have passed for manhood, which they simply aren't. There's more man to McKay than in all the John Wayne films laid end to end. And that's just one aspect of this great film.

Simply wonderful. I understand that critics regarded the film as rather lightweight. Maybe they just didn't get it. Perhaps that is true even of people associated with the film. I once heard Gregory Peck - my all-time favorite actor - speaking rather dismissively of the film. I was disappointed.

149,CommonPatriot,George Washington in a Western,9,2 May 2007,"This is undoubtedly the best western that I have ever seen. It has ""all"" the characteristics that make up a great drama. Burl Ives surely deserved his best supporting actor award. For that matter, all the acting was exceptional and should have been noted for posterity. In all fairness, if you were going to give the Oscar to Burl, it should have been also awarded to Gregory Peck. His portrayal of ""Jim Mckay"" was sure genius. He played a unique character that has not been reproduced since this late 1950's western. Mckay was a very friendly, educated and established Easterner who wasn't impressed with himself. He never wore his ""medals"" on his sleeve and was always trying to do the right thing. His character is the kind of person that we all strive to be like in our everyday lives. If only more men emulated the actions of ""Jim Mckay"", this surely would be a better world. Jim's honesty, truthfulness, integrity, sincerity, strength and courage stand up to the ""bigness"" of the ""Big Country"". The scenery and music make this a pure masterpiece by the great director, William Wyler. The Big Country deserved more than it got from Hollywood and over time, people have been re-introducing themselves to a classic. I seen this movie years ago and fell in love with it right away. I usually watch it once or twice a year when it comes on TV or when I get the hankering and pull the DVD out.

150,ipp-50484,"Why the Prejudice Against ""The Big Country""?",9,27 December 2016,"This is in response to the many critics who have slated the ""The Big Country"" for being too long (a famous cry of derision) and for dragging along without the proverbial action. What I cannot understand is how many of these same critics wax lyrical about so many other films that ""drag on"" for well nigh three hours. I am thinking about some of David Lean's epics, for example (""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Ryan's Daughter"") which come to mind here. I am not for one moment suggesting that these films are boring or lacking in artistic merit. I am simply curious as to why ""The Big Country"" is constantly singled out in almost the all the opening lines of the commentaries that have been written.Is this tendency, perhaps, attributed to the fact that the film is a western? Is the western, then, supposed to adhere strictly to the time honoured formula of blood and thunder, hell and leather bang-bang served up in the customary ninety-minute time capsule? Strait-jacketed? Comparisons, I concede, are odious. Pray, allow me a moment to allude to another Western purely in an attempt to illustrate my point.A fellow reviewer on this forum, in his denunciation of ""TBC"" (""boring, boring"") drew comparisons with Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" (a brilliant film, no doubt). In the words of respected critic, Leonard Maltin, the film is, ""a languid operatic masterpiece"". Maltin however, dismisses ""TBC"" as ""an overblown western"". And herein lies the rub!Both these films are thematically rich and complex, layered with gripping sub-plots emerging in all the respective stages of development. Both films are enrich by stellar performances from star-studded casts. There is never a dull moment in each. Even though the viewer may guess the outcome of ""TBC"", he or she is intrigued as to how the plot will finally resolve itself. This is what sustains the heart and soul of the picture.There is not a single flawed performance in ""TBC"". The actors remain true to the script. The action, like in ""Once Upon a Time ..."" and in Lean's masterpieces, is measured and seamless. It represents a study in the concentrated stream of consciousness (personified in the character of James Mackay). This is diametrically opposed by the smouldering temperments of many of the other characters in the fabric of the work; a classic case of antithetical counter-balancing, here. Pound for pound, ounce for ounce, ""TBC"" stands up to ""Once Upon a Time ..."" and its counterparts. Why then this prejudice against, ""The Big Country""? It intrigues me!",The Big Country

153,visigoth,Should be on anyone's Top Ten Westerns list.,8,17 May 1999,"William Wyler's ""The Big Country"" ranks up there with John Ford's ""The Searchers"" and Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" as one of the finest Westerns ever made.  Far from being simple formulaic good versus evil, the script makes room for ambiguity and conflicting moral codes, and it's hard to say who's right and who's wrong in the struggle between two feuding cattle barons.Gregory Peck does his usual strong decent man shtick as the retired seaman caught up in the struggle.  Initially presented as a naive outsider, unaccustomed to the way things are done in the rough cattle country, he is quickly and convincingly revealed as a man with an unswerving moral code of his own -- one that he will not compromise, even at the cost of his impending marriage to the wealthy daughter of one of the cattlemen. Charlton Heston adds a note of menace as the sneering and jealous ranch foreman who tries to humiliate Peck, but the room the script allows for moral ambiguity makes it too easy to characterize him as a bad guy, and indeed, toward the end he starts to question the motives and decisions of his aristocratic boss before the final confrontation between the two patriarchs.  Jean Simmons should have been given a little more time on screen, but that's a minor quibble given that she plays a strong female character with a mind and will of her own;  it's just a pity that toward the end, she has to wait for a man to save her.

156,gornadmiral,Must See Movie!,10,23 June 2018,"While many people may claim a book or movie is a must to read or view, the reason driving such as claim must be that the story treads ground that is not frequently done, and does it well. Such is the case here. This story should be MANDETORY viewing for high school or college age kids as an example of what it means to be a man, or what it means to be a woman. Early on it is filled with examples of what is 'thought' to be the best model of a man (the characters played by Chuck Conners, and Charlton Heston) - as rough riding, tough cowboys, and of a woman (Carol Baker) whose beauty is the main determinant. As the movie plays out it becomes apparent that Peck is the only 'true' man as his behavior repeatedly demonstrates, and Jean Simmons is the 'true' woman. By the end of the movie, there is some shift as 2 men from rival sides (Heston and Burl Ives) each demonstrate a flawed, but improved behavior compared to the bulk of the men. For Heston (who has now fought a lengthy fist fight with Peck, and finally learned what Peck was trying to teach him) now questions his prior way of thinking - yet still fights on the wrong side out of loyalty. Ives has a sense of honor (as he guns down his son for behaving dishonorable/evilly), but it is honor found too late. 
I have reviewed few movies here, but this one (because of its themes and the way it was done) I will give a solid 10 stars.
On a final note, the title is a running joke in the movie, that may be too subtle for some. Everybody has a misplaced 'concern' for Peck's 'city slicker' getting lost - even to the point of calling him a liar when they thought he was lost when he wasn't. What needs to be remembered here is not just that he was navigating by 'compass and crude map', but that he was formerly a sea captain, and had the ability to navigate distances far more vast than some 2-3 day jaunt, in an environment with fewer landmarks. This point was never directly made in the movie, though it could be inferred.",The Big Country

Throw in the scenery, the incredible musical score, and a plot with romance, and minimal violence, and you have a classic. On a home widescreen with the volume high, I am sure even compared to todays movies it is entertaining and ageless. As a footnote, I saw this movie years ago and it stuck in my mind. One day while listening to CBC radio on a call in request segment someone called in and asked for the theme from Big Country. It stirred me to track down a copy of the movie.

Its almost as if Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston et al are the supporting cast. Every muttering, monologue and bark are instantly quotable. I understand that as Producer Gregory Peck cast Burl Ives in the role, and its hard to believe that the role wasn't written for him specifically.The rest of the cast range from excellent to good and Charlton Heston is particularly brooding and says more in a sideways glance than most can manage in 10 minutes of dialogue.

162,ikhokher,Gregory Peck at his best,8,15 January 2014,"One of those classic movies that cling to the heart.I saw it on the big screen over 47 years ago and still i find it entertaining me all the the time.Gregory Peck was never better.The script is excellent and befitting the characters.This is William Wyler's and Peck's kind of western,sort of Quaker dogma,tolerance of different people and races,getting over prejudice to signify man's equality to man etc.That Real courage is to stand up for your beliefs in all circumstances and once having made a decision never go back on it.The characters of Peck,Burlesk Ives,fantastic,and Bickford eachn their way trying to prove this.When Peck answers whether he has seen a bigger country with oceans it sums up the message the film tries to give the audience.Better keep yourself clean and bright...you are the window through which you must see the world.A very great film and a very great actor Gregory Peck.",The Big Country
163,Gene_S_Shackelford,Easily at the top of the greatest westerns ever made.,10,30 November 2005,"I first saw this as a kid at a drive-in theatre. Even at this early age, I recognized the greatness of this cast and quality of film production which still ranks among the best of all categories combined. I continue to watch this film several times a year and enjoy each time as I did the first. All the acting, directing, filmography, and producing warrants an ""Oscar"". The music score, the title theme, and especially when Henry Terrell comes ""busting through Blanco Canyon"" is in a class all it's own. The film involves 2 families of different lifestyles setting several scenes of confrontation. Burl Ives is at his best as is Jean Simmons, Gregory Peck (""To Kill A Mockingbird"" quality), and Chuck Conners.",The Big Country
164,CAMPBELLOBK97,Arguably the greatest western movie.,9,9 April 2019,"Don't let the run time put you off. I have seen quite a few Westerns over the past few years, westerns such as The Searchers, Shane, How The West Was Won, The Man From Laramie and many more, but if I had pick a favourite it would be the Big Country.The film stars some of Hollywood's finest actors and actresses, such as Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Charlton Heston and not to forget Burl Ives, whose acting won an Academy Award for this movie and also has an unforgettable theme tune which is perfect for a western movie. These Factors alone were just enough to draw me in to the film and find out more about it for myself but if there is one thing what might look off putting is the run time put I can assure you the film is very fast past and this is what I loved about it.The story works perfect for the western genre and wouldn't work in any other kind of time or setting. Though The Big Country might sound like a good western movie it isn't like many other westerns which what makes it unique. The film is based on a New Englander; James McKay who movies to the west of America and ends up in between a bitter feud between to families over patch of land. Whereas many other Westerns I've watched the main character is usually a cowboy or someone from the West, whereas James McKay is more of a liberal and civilized character who has to adapt to the Wild West culture in order to fit in.I shall avoid spoiling it for you but if you are short of a film to watch I would definitely recommend The Big Country.",The Big Country

166,eastbergholt2002-1,Excellent Movie,9,8 December 2006,"I have always had a soft spot for The Big Country, which questioned the mythology of the Western. I had been brought up on the films of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood where the heroes behaved almost like medieval knights with a code of chivalry and superhuman fighting skills. On the other hand The Big Country has some similarities to Pleasantville. Jim McKay (Gregory Peck) is a 20th century man who stumbles into a fantasy macho world with a code of behavior and wardrobe invented by Hollywood. Men are men and apart from a small number of Mexicans there are no immigrants. The Little House on the Prairie on the Prairie probably provides a more accurate depiction life on the frontier than the typical Hollywood Western. Despite the limitations of this genre, it is still an entertaining movie.McKay arrives in the West to marry Pat Terrill (Carroll Baker). Pat is the daughter of the Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford) a successful rancher. The Major is involved in a feud, over watering rights, with a white-trash clan led by Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives). The major and Hannassey behave like ruthless mafia dons. McKay meets his fiancé in the East, but discovers she is spoiled. He becomes troubled by her devotion to the Major, who McKay concludes is more thug than gentleman. The Terrill's ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) takes an immediate dislike to McKay and tries to provoke him into fisticuffs. McKay doesn't like the Terrills and bolts.Pat's best friend is Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) a local schoolteacher. Maragon owns a stretch of land which provides the water to the Terrill and Hannassey ranches and because of this she is kidnapped and nearly raped. McKay doesn't feel obliged to live by the values of the Hollywood Western. He doesn't carry a gun and has strange pacifist notions. He dresses like the actual Wyatt Earp and Butch Cassidy rather than their film versions. Despite being a former ship's captain he is suspected of being effeminate and a coward. Maragon and McKay are the only main characters who are admirable or likable. McKay eventually proves that he is a real man. He has a secret fight with Steve Leech and rides a rodeo horse called Old Thunder. He makes Leech and the stable-hand swear to keep both events quiet regardless of the outcome. He later fights a duel with Hannassey's son (Chuck Connors). The screenplay is based on a novel by Donald Hamilton. The movie was directed by William Wyler, who won three Best Director Oscars. Wyler was a great director but he is out of favor with the critics despite having a good track record with intellectual source material (e.g., Somerset Maugham, Emily Bronte, John Fowles, Lillian Hellman and Henry James). The movie has an excellent cast, with Ives winning the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his performance. The film was also nominated for an Oscar for Jerome Moross's brilliant and memorable musical score. The movie was released in 1958 and lasts 166 minutes. Although many films from the 1950s seem dated, this is still enjoyable.",The Big Country
167,rayanoka,Gregory Pecks movie roles,9,20 January 2006,"This movie has some of the greatest actors that were in Hollywood at that time...Look at the movie ""The Magnificent Seven"" and you'll see another movie with so many great actors, so ""The Big Country"" ranks right up with some of the greatest westerns and the musical score fits right in with the theme of the show...Gregory Peck has been and always will be one of my favorite actors in the history of Hollywood....he was above reproach in his private life, even thought certain events in his family touched him and caused him anguish...But, his characters on the screen were most certainly played by him to the extent that they were believable and bordered on being actual people that we could relate to regarding the movie and the script..His good looks, and the way he carried himself on and off the screen, could only lead one to think that he was truly a fine actor and an equally great human being..we'll miss him, but we still have his movies to enjoy and treasure..thank for letting me comment on Gregory Peck...",The Big Country
