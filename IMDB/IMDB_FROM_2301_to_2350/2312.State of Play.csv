0,bkoganbing,The Privatization Of Homeland Security,8,13 May 2009,"Based on a British mini-series, State Of Play is a top rate political thriller that asks some very interesting questions about what President Eisenhower called the military industrial complex. The problem is that Congressman Ben Affleck who is asking those questions at a hearing involving those private security firms that the USA employs in Iraq and Afghanistan has some nasty secrets of his own of a personal nature. Those threaten to derail Affleck's investigation.It seems as though Congressman Ben has got himself involved with a female staffer shades of Gary Condit and she was shoved under the Washington, DC Metro. Affleck has a friend in investigative reporter Russell Crowe, they were college roommates back in the day. If anyone can clear him, Crowe can providing Affleck is really being truthful in all things. Crowe has some problems too, he's got an eager young reporter looking for the sensational in Rachel McAdams on the same paper, a publisher in Helen Mirren looking for some quick results as other Capitol Hill reporters draw a bead on the story. And if that's not enough, Crowe's been having a little side action with Robin Wright Penn who is Mrs. Affleck.It sounds like a soap opera, but actually State Of Play is a very intelligent political drama and if you think you know how it will end, I'm here to assure you this film will twist your mind like a pretzel. Yet the script is clear enough so you can follow the many plot twists.Three other good performances to note are Jason Bateman as a publicity agent and part time pimp, Jeff Daniels as a moralizing older Congressman, and Michael Berresse a former soldier who might be the most moral person in the film. That fact proves to be his undoing.The questions State Of Play asks are real ones about the government's over reliance on these private security firms to deal with terrorists. I highly recommend you see this very disturbing film.",State of Play
1,Leofwine_draca,"Decent thriller, but missing something special",6,10 December 2012,"I liked STATE OF PLAY. It ticked all of the right boxes: solid direction, good, playing-against-type performances from most of the cast, unforeseen twists and some great set-pieces, including a ferocious encounter in an underground car park.Do I think it's a truly great film? No, not by a long shot. It's inventive, and well-paced, and one of those films that stimulates the brain as well as the senses, but...I didn't find much emotion at the heart. A similar thriller like David Fincher's ZODIAC really grabbed me with its depiction of Jake Gyllenhaal's dedicated journalist, but there's little emotion at the core of STATE OF PLAY. It's too busy with the mystery stuff and the ending just left me cold.Russell Crowe gives one of his most interesting performances to date as the long-haired, tubby journalist and the aforementioned scene in the underground car park sees him play isolated and frightened, a real counterpoint to his usual tough 'n' taciturn type performances. The rest of his obsessive-y type stuff has been previously done in American GANGSTER.Ben Affleck is surprisingly good as the shady politician, and it's refreshing to see him playing a character with a bit more depth for a change. Speaking of depth, Rachel McAdams is the one weak link in the chain, completely out of hers, while Helen Mirren seems to be trying too hard to emulate Meryl Streep in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA for the majority of her scenes.",State of Play
2,SnoopyStyle,Densely packed thriller,7,17 June 2014,"A druggie thief is gunned down in a dark tunnel along with a pizza delivery guy on a bicycle by a mysterious assassin with a suitcase. The delivery guy survives. Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is a gruff cynical beat reporter checking out the story. Meanwhile a young female staff to congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) dies falling off the subway platform. Collins is assumed to have had an affair with that aide. Ambitious young writer Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) from the newspaper's online side wants to write something about Collins. McAffrey was Collins' college roommate. As Cal investigates, he uncovers a complicated corrupt Washington political system and a connection between the thief and the political aide.There are great actors being directed by the first rate Kevin Macdonald. There are all kinds of things being jammed into this. There is the newspaper world. There is the Washington political world. There is the military industrial complex. There is an assassin. There is personal history between the characters. It is a lot but Macdonald keeps it all understandable. Russell Crowe keeps the story moving with the attention on him. It's a firecracker thriller although it is a little long.",State of Play
3,Hitchcoc,Nice Media/Political Thriller!,8,9 February 2010,"I love to watch Russell Crowe's work. He has some elements of the anti-hero, driven for what he feels is right, leaving a few ""victims"" behind. This is one of those old fashioned movies where people get in over their heads and have to see things to the end. Unfortunately, there are some evil forces at work that are lined up to protect themselves. It portrays the levels people will go to to maintain their positions. Crowe's character moves in on an old friend, a kind of Clintonesque character whose discretions have come home to roost after the woman with whom he is having an affair is murdered. It's possible that things are spiraling out of control but they are in too deep now. There is a nice chemistry--that Washington Post kind of work--where they have to decide to put the paper on the line to keep integrity in the story. Some of this film is quite predictable and there are some twists that stretch things a bit. Still, there is huge energy and intensity that follows throughout. It was a nice surprise because I really knew little about it going in.",State of Play
4,jboothmillard,State of Play,5,24 April 2019,"I remember reading about this film mainly because of the leading actor, and I had it recorded on VHS for some time, it was rated well and then I read more of the names in the cast, so I was hoping it would be worthwhile, directed by Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void, The Last King of Scotland, Life in a Day, Whitney). Basically a thief fleeing through Georgetown in Washington, D.C., is shot by a man carrying a briefcase, along with a deliveryman who witnesses the crime, he falls into a coma. The following day a woman is killed by a Washington Metro train after apparently committing suicide. Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, suspects there is more to her to death, as according to reporter and blogger Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), her death occured in a spot with CCTV blind spots. Cal believes the shootings are related to Sonia's death and finds a link between the thief and a homeless girl who approached him. The homeless girl revealed that the thief killed was a friend of hers, she gave Cal photographs that the thief took from the killer's briefcase, they reveal CCTV photos of Sonia talking to a well-dressed man. Della visits the deliveryman in hospital who has recovered and regained consciousness, but she witnesses his murder, by an unseen sniper, before the man can give any information. Later, Della watches CCTV from the hospital, and recognises a man she saw there. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck), Cal's former roommate and old friend, was distraught to hear that the woman killed was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a researcher on his staff. Collins is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defence contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. It is revealed that PointCorp stands to gain billions of dollars annually from its mercenary activities in the Middle East and domestically. Collins shares with Cal his research findings: PointCorp is cooperating with other defence contractors to create a monopoly and purchase government surveillance and defence contracts. Cal does some digging and finds someone linked to the suspected assassin, he confirms the killer's place, he calls the police, but the man disappears after trying to shoot Cal. Della follows a lead, and identifies the well-dressed man who was speaking to Sonia in the photographs as Dominic Foy (Jason Bateman), a PR executive working for a subsidiary of PointCorp. Cal blackmails Foy into talking about his activities with Sonia and secretly tapes their conversation. He reveals that Sonia was being paid to spy on Collins and to seduce him to get information for PointCorp, but she fell in love with Collins and became pregnant with his child by the time she was killed. The editor, Cameron Lynne (Dame Helen Mirren) is displeased with the often unorthodox and illegal activities Cal has carried out to get the facts of the story, she initially tries to stop him from continuing his investigation. But before the newspaper goes to press, Collins goes on record to present his research into PointCorp, and his affair with Sonia, and why he believes why she was murdered. But other facts come to light following the on-record recording, Cal realises Collins already knew Sonia was working for PointCorp, and he suspects Collins himself may be connected with Sonia's assassin. A photograph of Collins from his military days, with the assassin in the frame, confirms Cal's hunch, it turns out Collins was suspicious of Sonia and the man was hired to watch her. The assassin is U.S. Army corporal Robert Bingham (Michael Berresse), Collins had saved his life, Bingham hated PointCorp more than he did, and says that he killed Sonia with no authorization. Cal reveals he called the police but has given Collins enough time to make a head start, but as he leaves the building, Cal is confronted by Bingham. Officers arrive and shoot Bingham before he opens fire, following this Cal leaves and goes to his office, there he and Della type their own stories, and the completed works are printed. Also starring Robin Wright as Anne Collins, Jeff Daniels as George Fergus, Harry Lennix as Detective Donald Bell, Josh Mostel as Pete, Barry Shabaka Henley as Gene Stavitz and Viola Davis as Dr. Judith Franklin. Crowe does well as the leading journalist, Affleck is interesting as the rising politician, Mirren does her typical but likeable hard-nosed thing, Daniels in his short time is unusually sinister, and McAdams is fine. The story was originally a BBC TV mini-series, I was just about able to follow the story of conspiracy, including how digital technology threatens more traditional reporting, it is very chatty, but there are moments that get your attention to keep pace up, overall it is a reasonable political thriller. Worth watching!",State of Play
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Decent, If Unmemorable, Political Thriller",7,21 September 2009,"I would label this a ""decent-but-unmemorable political thriller,"" something you'd probably enjoy viewing but a few weeks later had forgotten much of it. Usually, movies which star Russell Crowe are more dynamic, although Crowe still mesmerizes as usual.I liked the twists and turns at the end, but one has to wait about two hours for those and that's a little too long a wait. As slick a production as it was, and with acceptable acting from actor, it was many of the characters here that seemed more like Hollywood stereotypes than real-life people.There was Crowe with the hippie looks from 30-40 years ago and who has the daring of James Bond; the Washington newspaper editor being a foul-mouthed Brit (crusty Helen Mirren) who uses profane expresses the Americans wouldn't know; the neophyte blogster (Rachel McAdams) being drop-dead gorgeous and getting her way despite tough bosses; the bad guys being anyone connected with the military (man, is that getting old, from Dr. Strangelove to today's films - it never changes), the professional sniper/assassin conveniently missing the good guy (Crowe) although he could kill anyone else......you get the picture - a few too many liberal film clichés. The most realistic character was probably ""Rep. Stephen Collins (D-Pa),"" played by the least of the actors, Ben Affleck.As for minor characters, I thought ""Dominic Foy,"" played by Jason Bateman, was fascinating, as was Robin Wright.Overall, for entertainment purposes it was okay; not something you'd yawn and fall asleep watching, although you might be confused here and there. Through the gimmicks of hyped-up music and sound effects here and there, the suspense was evident throughout the two-plus hours. It's also an interesting look at today's battle between old and new ""media,"" meaning newspapers and the Internet, respectively.Overall, it's enough to warrant as a purchase at the rental store but not as a blind buy despite the ""name"" cast.",State of Play
6,rmax304823,"Who, When, What, Where, How -- and Fire.",5,22 December 2010,"I missed about half an hour from the middle of this production, so it's difficult to describe any response to the film in its entirety. It's about two reporters of the fictional Washington Globe (Crowe and McAdams) who together uncover some kind of intricate plot involving a mercenary group like Blackwater, the sneakiness of a young ambitious Congressman (Afleck), and the reasons behind a couple of murders, including that of a pizza-delivery boy.Of the scenes I managed to catch, some of the action is exceptionally well done. The pizza-delivery boy is on the verge of recovering in a hospital room under guard when -- Pow, pow, pow! The murder of a patient who has something to tell is a cliché but in this instance it's handled inventively. (WHY the delivery boy had to be killed is unexplained, since he actually has nothing to tell.) It was the only action scene I was able to see. The rest is rather talky. That's not necessarily bad. It depends on how the talk is handled and what it's about. ""All The President's Men,"" which this film sometimes imitates flagrantly, even down to Dustin Hoffman's floppy long hair, is ALL talk.I didn't care for the overall look of the film, I have to say, and that's the director's decision. When will we be relieved of all that darkness? Everything seems to be in shadow, or moments away from murk. I wish the people behind the camera had aped ""All The President's Men""'s sometimes clinical atmosphere. When Redford and Hoffman visited an informant, it was in an ordinary room in everyday light. The viewer wasn't worried about some maniac lurking in a corner with an ugly gun. The crowning insult is the news room itself. In ""All The President's Men"" it was thoroughly lighted, bright with fluorescence. Here it's like Frankenstein's laboratory.Another modern annoyance is the shaky camera. You know, at first, every camera was mounted on a tripod and moved little, except by machines or cranes. Then, a generation ago, the Steadicam was invented. The photographer could perch it on his shoulder and walk around -- or even run around -- and the images were kept smooth as if by gyroscope. Here -- and SO often elsewhere -- the camera is hand held and wobbles. It tilts and yaws. It pans from a pair of hands to a pair of lips. It scoots erratically from one face to the next. It turns the viewer into a decerebrate preparation.Crowe is a competent actor but they've given him a growth of beard and the hair of Lady GaGa, and he's a slob. Rachel McAdams has a tinkly voice and a nose that seems to be the result of the application of one of those plastic French curve cut outs that we used in high school. Her nose perfectly describes the arc of a circle. She's beautiful in a conventional way and wears some delicious and endearing nevises on her cheek and neck, suggesting that there are others, hidden and secret. She doesn't seem to have much range as an actress but she's not given much chance. Ben Afleck, I'm afraid, I found unimpressive with his crackly adolescent voice. Helen Mirren dominates each scene she's in.It's difficult to make a general judgment because the plot, which I was unable to capture holistically, may have been a real winner, but based on what I did see, I wouldn't put much effort into re-viewing it.",State of Play
7,Tweekums,A gripping thriller,8,28 April 2010,"Since I haven't seen the original mini-series on which this is based I can't comment on how they compare. Watching this I didn't think it felt like it had been cut down from six hour to two, it just meant to story got on at a cracking pace. The story opens with two apparently unconnected deaths; one a homeless man chased through the back streets of Washington then gunned down in an alley, the other a congressman's aide who ended up in the tracks in front of an underground train. It soon emerges that the woman had been involved in an affair with the congressman and while most people assumed she committed suicide but as reporters Cal and Della of the Washington Globe investigate the two cases they discover they are linked and start to suspect both are part of a corporate conspiracy to discredit the Congressman who was a leading member of an investigation into a company that has been hoovering up billion dollar government security contracts. Cal knows the congressman from the time they were at college and despite Cal having had an affair with his wife the two still seem to be friends, this leads to some hard choices when he must decide whether or not to follow leads that could harm his friend.I found this film to be gripping from start to finish and didn't spot the twist until it was revealed at the end. The actors did a good job; it was nice to see a hero who was a bit of a slob... Russell Crowe certainly didn't look as athletic as he did in Gladiator. Rachel McAdams did a fine job as Della, it was refreshing to have a story with a man and a woman working together and at no point was there any suggestion of a relationship between them that was anything but professional. Ben Affleck seemed fairly restrained, which suited his role as serious Congressman Stephen Collins. While much of the film involved running around chasing leads there was plenty of action and the fact that Cal was a reporter not a policeman or member of the security services meant he was unarmed which made certain scenes more tense than they would have been otherwise.",State of Play

9,moonspinner55,Journalistic ethics vs. sensationalism...with former friends as news sources,6,18 April 2009,"Americanization of the highly-regarded television mini-series from Britain is, at its heart, the exploration of newspaper journalists (working under even greater pressure today to grab the major headlines first) having to deal with police procedure once they've gotten hold of an explosive story--and to sort out the ramifications of friendship when acquaintances become sources and bosses on deadline are demanding results. A female Congressional aide in Washington, D.C. has either been murdered or committed suicide, a story which quickly leads to the young woman's romantic infidelity with a married Congressman--an old college friend of Washington Globe reporter Russell Crowe. Crowe, playing a scruffy warhorse whose neck is always on the line, teams with cub reporter Rachel McAdams in ferreting out the girl's sordid past as well as the Congressman's ties to a corrupt organization which uses the military for financial gain--with kick-back to certain politicians. Very much in the same vein as ""Absence of Malice"" from 1981, this one too has the proverbial montage of a daily newspaper being pieced together from the ground floor up. The characters are equally clichéd, from Helen Mirren's demanding news editor to Robin Wright Penn's benumbed political wifey (a thankless role for sure). Jason Bateman enlivens the complicated scenario with a colorful bit as a kinky supplier, and Crowe does well when he has the opportunity (a battle of words late in the game with Ben Affleck is well played, and Russell's contempt/compassion for inexperienced McAdams has its pleasures). The picture is alert and detailed, handsomely filmed and occasionally gripping. Yet, the cinematic roots of a journalistic thriller go way back (beyond the TV series), and many of these principle players are starting to become musty nuisances. Essentially, ""State of Play"" is nothing at all new, but only old-school film-goers will recognize this. **1/2 from ****",State of Play

McAffey and Frye then start to sort out what they have learned about the researcher, Collins' investigation and a series of photographs to get at the truth.Complex, fast-moving, with a terrific cast, this is a really good, old-fashioned thriller.

11,Quinoa1984,long as I can see the light...,7,25 April 2009,"I had heard State of Play, from a number of critics, would be one of those movies that started out good, had a strong first half, and then started turning predictable and whatnot in the 2nd. Turns out it's not quite like that. State of Play is consistently good, has gripping parts and some very good performances, until it suddenly undoes its own highly cooked conspiracy-thriller intentions for one of those twist-endings that takes things back a notch. And it's not a good twist- not so much because of how the scene is written, the final confrontation between the characters, but because it deflates the rest of the paranoid drama and suspense that's been building up to it.State of Play is not without some other curious things to it, such as Russell Crowe playing the grizzled old veteran reporter who may also have the kind of skills that should make him Sherlock Holmes's understudy - or competition. In the film his character practically makes the police obsolete as he takes it upon himself to investigate what is behind the suicide(?) of an assistant to the congressman played by Ben Affleck who is also an old college roommate of his. Rachel McAdams' character has to keep up at times, breathlessly and sometimes with protest, with Cal's methods of inquiry and extracting info.And yet, I could buy into a lot of it, partly because of Crowe's performance, as usual with some good gravitas and weight and with the measure of experience he's had as an actor. and partly because it keeps the suspense and the will-he-or-won't-he aspect of the deadline for the paper. Up until those final ten minutes when that twist (not to spoil too much but it is a Keyser Soze bit as other critics have inferred), the filmmakers keep us interested in the events because of us being so invested with Crowe and McAdams tracking down a case that balloons to include defense contractors, the media, and lord knows what else.Again, performances make the difference, and at the least State of Play's director (of Last Kind of Scotland fame) knows how to corral right actors for just the right parts. He gets Crowe and McAdams well paired, and Helen Mirren as the headstrong but lenient editor in chief, and especially from Affleck who can bring on a sense of truth even when he's lying to our faces- perfect for a politician. Jason Bateman, by the way, steals his scenes as a PR guy who talks and talks big and flamboyantly until he has to crack under pressure. Even the guy who played the undercover black-op style killer was perfectly cast.The big problem then, aside from the twist ending, is that everything in the film, for all of its fine moments of storytelling, does feel the crunch of being adapted from a 5 hour mini-series. While not seen by me, I can tell that there is likely more room for subject matter to breathe, for the audience to digest a lot of this information. As with Watchmen, what they cut out probably worked for the feature film, but only up to a point. As in any story, in journalism or film, the details do stack up. All of the (very) impressive tricks with having cameras in the scenes shooting from far away and at different and opposing angles meant to create tension can't quite surmount this crunch. It's a good film that at times tries a little too much to be more important that it is.",State of Play

The prospect of Collins becoming president seems less and less likely, however, when his research assistant/mistress is viciously murdered, and some unsavory truths begin to surface.

But as old fashioned ink reporter Cal McAffrey and his savvy, moving with the times assistant, Della Frye, search the story, they unearth sinister clues that take them into a murky world of cover-ups and political intrigue.There has become a tendency in recent years to neglect the type of film that has no hi-tech thrills or indie histrionics as its selling points. Search down a number of critic avenues about State Of Play and you find words such as solid, safe and reliable, words that on the face of it, are faint praise. It's almost as if this type of intelligent and tightly written thriller has no right to be considered a leading light in modern Hollywood. Which of course is foolhardy and very wrong since State Of Play is one of the best films of 2009.Based on a critical darling BBC series written by Paul Abbott, State Of Play had a troubled beginning. Both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton bailed from the project, Pitt literally at the last minute, thus leading one to think that it was a project doomed to failure. Into their places came Russell Crowe (McAffrey) and Ben Affleck (congressman Stephen Collins). Both men on something of a rebuilding curve with their respective careers. With both men doing quite excellent work; even if the one failing in the film is accepting that these two guys were actual room mates back in the higher education days. The piece is further boosted by the reassuring presence of Helen Mirren as McAffrey's boss, Cameron Lynne, while Rachel McAdams (Frye), Robin Wright Penn (Anne Collins), Jeff Daniels (Rep. George Fergus) and Jason Bateman (Dominic Foy) all impact greatly as the intricate strands get threaded together.So a throwback to good honest mystery/thriller cinema of yore then? You betcha.

The original series was by Paul Abbott, but the film was the collaboration of Billy Ray, Tony Gilmore and Matthew Michael Carnahan. The makers of this film have combined equal parts of conspiracy, crime and duplicity that plays well in the story. Rodrigo Prieto, the cinematographer, captures Washington in dark shades as well as some of the glamor of the city and the corridors of power. Alex Heffes music plays well in the background.Russell Crowe, with a few extra pounds, makes an unkempt, yet approachable reporter. Mr. Crowe inspired performance keeps the movie flowing effortlessly. Rache McAdams plays the ambitious Della Frye who is not as experienced as McAffrey. Helen Mirren is seen as Cameron Lynne, the editor of the big newspaper, convincingly. Robin Wright Penn is Anne Collins, the politician's wife that sticks to her man, even though he had cheated on her. Ben Affleck is Rep. Collins. Jason Bateman shows up in a minor, but well played role. Jeff Daniels, although not a principal, has some pivotal scenes in the film.",State of Play

This one starts out with a suspenseful killing on a dark and rainy night in an alley and never lets go of a grip on the attention.The actors all have great help from a well-written, tightly paced script that affords all of them to shine. RUSSELL CROWE is the center of the tale as a scrappy newspaper reporter, slovenly and overweight, who doesn't care if he has to risk his life to help a friend caught up in a political scandal (BEN AFFLECK). He and Affleck dominate the proceedings, each delivering forceful performances.RACHEL McADAMS is delightful as another nervy reporter, who becomes Crowe's sidekick and wants to help him get to the bottom of a mystery involving the death of a mysterious young woman with close connections to a corrupt corporation.HELEN MIRREN as a tough no-nonsense newspaper boss, JEFF DANIELS as a sleazy congressman with too much power and JASON BATEMAN as a smooth operator who talks too much--all of them are excellent. Bateman is a real surprise, having developed into the kind of actor who could give James Bond a lesson in being suave and polished. He has certainly matured as an actor.MICHAEL BERRESSE is strikingly sinister as the gunman whose presence looms over the whole story as he prepares to assassinate others to keep a lid on corporate corruption in Washington, D.C.It's an intense thriller, directed in high style by Kevin Macdonald and should keep fans of this genre well entertained throughout.",State of Play

Crowe and McAdams gel well together and are on great form, the adaption from the original television serial is strong, and the direction builds up quite a sense of tension until, I have to say a really lacklustre ending that I found quite underwhelming.

Here we have Crowe diving in after a story and not letting it go even when there seems to be pressure to publish anything from above, even if its wrong or only part of the story. Its the current battle between getting a story NOW and getting the story right. On top of that its a damn fine mystery that isn't as completely clear as you may think it it is. I had heard from a friend that the film was good but too complicated and I feared that the compression of a 6 hour BBC miniseries was going to make the film impenetrable, or a mess, instead I found it easy to follow even if one wandered off to the bathroom.This is a great little popcorn movie and I really enjoyed myself.

I did not expect this to be a ""must-see"", meanwhile, I am quite glad I gave it a chance. From the opening moments to the very end, this had me completely engaged. The pacing is completely even and spot-on. Fast, without being overwhelming, and it allows itself to dwell on occasion, where it is entirely acceptable for it to. The plot is highly interesting, and keeps developing nicely throughout, never growing excessively complex, so you can follow it, though it doesn't grow dull. All of the writing in this, in general, is rather great, the dialog(with a nice tendency to be sharp and clever, and seldom trying too hard) and characters(all of them credible) are impeccable. The mystery keeps you guessing, and the twists are well thought out. This has a good, dry sense of humor that doesn't call attention to itself. The cinematography and editing are marvelous. The acting is excellent, including that of Daniels and Affleck(I didn't doubt either of them before, however, I understand that many do). I cannot name a single poor performance in this. There is occasional language, moderate with one or two downright strong swear words. This is PG-13, but it doesn't feel watered down, as there is disturbing thematic content, and mild violence.

An animal attackD.) CorruptionI'm sure 99 people out of 100 would choose corruption. And they'd be right.""State of Play"" is a journalist movie based in Washington D. C. Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) was a seasoned reporter for the Washington Globe. While on a murder story the leads connected him to an apparent suicide by a woman named Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer). This story had legs because she was tied to a congressman named Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) who was also a friend of Cal's. Collins was on some sort of senate sub-committee investigating a company called Point Corp, a defense contractor. And like that, I've just given you all of the main ingredients for a movie that was about corruption and conspiracies.I like journalism movies. My favorites are ""Pelican Brief,"" ""All the President's Men,"" ""Kill the Messenger,"" ""Shattered Glass,"" and ""The Paper."" This movie stacks up nicely against the others. One of its more impressive traits is that it showed 21st century journalism compared to old school journalism. Cal, the old school journalist, has to contend with and eventually combine with blogger Della Frye (Rachel McAdams). The two of them hammer away at this grand story which works as OJT (on the job training) for Frye while allowing her to be a part of something big.""State of Play"" was smart and suspenseful. A movie about Washington corruption isn't going to surprise anyone, nor does this one. I would've been more surprised if it was about something other than corruption. As if to make sure all the seedy boxes were checked (sex, lies, and murder), they checked the sex box twice with a simmering love triangle between Collins, Cal, and Collin's wife Ann (Robin Wright). They don't get sexually explicit, in fact there's no nudity to speak of, but it is discussed. Nothing like a love triangle to heap more wood on the cliché fire.

A game ensemble cast (including Daniels as a shady mentor of Affleck's and Mirren as the grande dame boss to the scribes), a sharply structured, twisty screenplay adaptation (based on the popular BBC TV series) by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray, and the smooth and efficient direction by Kevin Macdonald makes for an effective valentine to '70s newspaper thrillers like ""All The President's Men"".",State of Play

The plot is dense - there is an awful lot of story - but never confusing, and the performances, as you might expect from a cast of this calibre, are all very good.

Supporting roles staffed with the likes of Jeff Daniels, Viola Davis (Doubt) and Jason Bateman. Helen Mirren as the newspaper editor trying to get along with the new owners is pretty over the top and clichéd.

Sadly no one under 40 really has any appreciation for what real life reporters can accomplish.

It may remind viewers of All the President's Men despite falling short of that film's structure and craft. Russell Crowe plays a newspaper journalist investigating a double homicide that may link to a political conspiracy. Directed by Kevin Macdonald with numerous plot turns. Crowe holds strong as he unravels truths that he will not want to face. Rachel McAdams is solid as another journalist who works alongside Crowe in seeking answers. What is truly great here is that she is not reduced too the standard sexual tease. In fact, she discovers much of the plot turns. On the other end however is the casting of Ben Affleck who plays a congressman caught in adultery and stranded within the investigation but the role is too obvious. This leads to a conclusion that is more predictable than it needed to be. Helen Mirren is also reduced to the standard role of an editor demanding the deadline met. Jason Bateman is also present but he seems to excel better in comic roles as oppose to dramatic roles. It gives insight to journalism while presenting the pressure to meet the demands It is a well made thriller but for superior and more insightful viewing check out All the President's Men.

29,gradyharp,"At All Costs, Find the Truth",10,17 February 2010,"It is so refreshing to see a 'suspense thriller' genre film that does not star building explosions and car chases as the main characters. STATE OF PLAY demands that the audience stay tuned in throughout this fine plot, so nimble are its twists and turns that it is easy to get lost unless focus is maintained. Matthew Carnahan, Tony Gilroy, and Billy Ray have adapted the television series by Paul Abbott, handed it over to Director Kevin Macdonald who in turn has placed this dazzling story in the capable hands of some terrific actors and the result is a film that is tightly woven and beautifully executed entertainment. There are many levels to the story - the dwindling impact of the printed American newspapers that are succumbing to the immediacy of the Internet, the demise of investigative journalism and the rise of 'hot stories' for the sake of selling newspapers as opposed to informing the public of important issues, the deep seated corruption in the government and the extent to which the government will go to cover up important yet politically delicate issues, and the loss of reporters who have a drive to investigate until the truth is uncovered. Russell Crowe, far too fat and grungy for a healthy actor, is the reporter bent on finding the truth, Helen Mirren is the desperately driven editor at the threat of losing her job for lack of Inquirer-like stories to sell her paper, Rachel McAdams is the bright young but inexperienced reporter who learns the game from Crowe, Crowe's best friend Ben Affleck is the Congressman at the center of the latest governmental mess, Robin Wright Penn is Affleck's wife and Crowe's lover, and the plot twists and turns on the murder of an aide to Affleck who is not what she seemed to be. But then none of the government types (Jeff Daniels), PR people (Jason Bateman), or others involved in the plot are clean. The plot is well outlined by others but it would be unfair to go without commenting on the excellence of the cameos by Viola Davis as a pathologist, David Harbour as an informer, Henry Lennix as the detective, and Michael Berresse (best known as a Broadway musical comedy star) as the terrifying hit man. Without depending on CGI effects, this is simply a stunning drama where the terror and thrills come from the performances by the actors (this may be Russell Crowe's finest role to date!). A film for thinking adults. Grady Harp",State of Play
30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: State of Play,10,6 June 2009,"I'm a fan of a good investigative thriller, and State of Play combines that with some good old fashioned action from the newsroom with dogged reporters seeking perennial truth. Written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray, you know you're in for one gripping ride with relentless twists and turns, as between them they are responsible for stories such as Lions for Lambs, The Kingdom, Michael Clayton, the Bourne franchise screenplays, Proof of Life, Breach and Shattered Glass. Whew! Imagine all the going points about those films all combined into one!I thoroughly enjoyed how Conflict of Interests, as a theme is examined in the film. There's hardly a black and white answer, especially when one's moral authority gets put on the line because of the conscious decision to pursue personal or professional gain above all others. Simple things, like romantic entanglements, having to investigate and dig into the dirt of friends, code of conducts violations and the likes make all the characters here susceptible at one point or another to question their own beliefs, be they misguided just because they're pursuing something for the greater good, or to make compromises for the lesser of two evils.And of course this will somehow lead to a corruption of the process. Do leads get released to the authorities for thorough investigations, or should the press (with press freedom firmly exercised of course) be trusted to exhaust those leads in a bid to starve off investigative leaks for that one big scoop to bring glory to themselves and their paper, in the name of truth-seeking. Or would parent companies be pressured to force the hand of their employees to come up with half-truths for fueling the need for readers to continue picking up the papers for the latest, which translates to profits?For Russell Crowe's Cal McAffrey, his journey here is never easy, with personal friendships, moral ambiguity and professional pressure all lead to one crazy navigation through choppy waters, which includes having his life put on the line and at risk when faced with any one accidental move on the chessboard. It's never easy digging and dishing out dirt, not when folks tend to shy away from a reporter and not want to be on the record, but when you think you have conflict of interests all straightened out, they will all come back to haunt you.Thankfully for him, help (or adversity in the first place) comes in the form of Rachel McAdams' rookie reporter and online columnist (read: Blogger) Della Frye, who gets hired by the Washington Globe just because of their recognition for an online presence, and the ability to shoot straight from the hip without reliance on the presses for production for the next day. This tussle between old school investigative journalism to check everything and follow up on leads, and the new age modern mindset of quantity over quality, spawned a superb subplot and theme, with the battle of two different paradigms, though at the superficial level, a fight between thoroughness and speed, between a veteran and a new bird, and even up to the relevance of newspapers in this day and age.Director Kevin Macdonald weaved so much into a film just over two hours, that it deserves a second watch. While it's something like Ron Howard's The Paper or even the recent Japanese film Climber's High with their take on the journalism profession, the story ensures that what would seem like a series of random events of an apparent suicide and two night time killings, would string together an intricate web of political intrigue as well, touching on defense contractors, outsourcing/insourcing, and that of a politician's battle against opponents when he crafts bills or heads inquiries. I thought Ben Affleck adequately did what he could with the role as a Representative, together with supporting cast such as Helen Mirren, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, and Jason Bateman in a somewhat hilarious role of a middleman who's stuck in the middle of the whole mess.State of Play is one intense roller coaster ride that didn't shift down from fourth gear throughout, with foot firmly on the pedal all the way to the finishing line. Great score, great ensemble cast and an engaging story all contribute to make this a film that I would consider breaking into my top 10 favourites of the year.",State of Play

Russell Crowe is the journalist for the fictional ""Washington Globe"" who's investigating the case even though his lifelong friendship with both the congressman and the congressman's beautiful but long-suffering wife (Robin Penn Wright) may represent a major conflict-of-interest for the paper.

As a sidebar, the movie examines how compromise has become the order of the day in journalism, now that an ever-dwindling number of ""legitimate"" newspapers are being forced to compete with sensationalistic tabloids and blogs for readership and revenue.The performances are fine throughout, with Crowe, Affleck and Mirren the obvious standouts.",State of Play
38,Robert_duder,A simple and provocative thriller that doesn't hurt the brain but still entertains,8,12 July 2009,"Unfortunately State of Play is a movie that won't stick with most movie goers for very long. You see it, you enjoy it, you might even tell a friend about it but after a day or two it's lost in your mind and you will wonder five years from now when it airs on Television whether you ever saw this movie. That doesn't make it bad by any means but just simply forgettable meaning it goes in, entertains you...in some cases thoroughly but doesn't have staying power. It usually means that the movie won't do overtly well in theaters despite it's cast and budget. I really enjoyed State of Play, it's a smart, well made, and intriguing thriller that will keep you interested in the plot right from the very beginning to the end. The plot could have been made very complicated in order to appear smarter but the film makers don't go there. State of Play is very mainstreamed and something anyone can watch and enjoy. The story is straight forward and action based with plenty of thrilling moments and solid story telling. It's the perfect film to curl up with on a Saturday night and you will enjoy it. A renter not a buyer as they say? One thing State of Play has going for it is the cast. The cast in this film is just phenomenal. You have Russell Crowe as seasoned reporter Cal McAffrey. It's true Crowe has lost some of his edge in the last few years but he still has a lot of talent and his performance in this film is actually very solid although he looks ridiculous. Why wouldn't he cut his hair for this film? Rachel McAdams is perfect as new eager reporter Della Frye. She has this look and style of being a go getter, a Lois Lane type reporter. Best of all McAdams and Crowe have terrific chemistry. They are the perfect mystery solving team. Ben Affleck has a small but significant role in the film and he does a terrific job as well as a scorned Congressman. This is a great turn for him and I hope he gets recognized as being back on a positive turn in his career. Hollywood heavyweight Helen Mirren together with great character actors Robin Wright-Penn, Jason Bateman and Jeff Daniels round out this phenomenal cast. A huge part of what makes State of Play so watchable and so worthwhile is this solid cast.On top of this cast...four of which are Academy Award winners if I count correctly? The director of this film is Kevin Macdonald who won an Academy Award for a documentary and was at the helm of the critically praised Last King of Scotland as well. He tells a solid story and did a great job of keeping the film simple. Some might watch this film and say part of the problem is that it is too simple but I think sometimes we need something that doesn't hurt the brain and that we can watch and appreciate and enjoy without it being a critical darling or a shoe in for awards. Maybe I am wrong and it is better and smarter than I thought but regardless I am still recommending the film because you will enjoy it!! 8/10",State of Play

Driven by an imposing ""slobbed-up"" (or should that be ""down"") star turn by Russell Crowe, the film starts with two violent deaths and one near-death incident (the killer finishes the job a little later), ultimately linked to a high-profile senator and his crusade against a multi-million dollar security company hoping to ramp up its operation from being Iraq & Afghanistan-based to even more lucrative homeland contracts.Very little though is what it seems and there are numerous twists and turns, interspersed with thrilling action and suspense set-pieces before justice, sort-of, prevails.Alongside Crowe and contrasting his crusading old-style journalism is Rachel MacAdams as the high-tech new-reporter-on-the-block. To be honest though, I found her playing lacked definition and was rarely engaged when she was on the screen. Helen Mirren gets a fairly pointless part too as their ""tough-ma'am"" editor but Ben Affleck continues his renaissance with a good performance as the play-all-sides senator who gets his come-uppance at the conclusion. The best character for me though might well be the wonderful, sprawling, old-fashioned news-room, which evoked memories (deliberately so, as director MacDonald makes clear in the obligatory ""Making of..."" mini-feature) of ""All The President's Men"" and to these eyes and ears TV's same-era superb ""Lou Grant"" series, especially the movie's closing montage showing the putting-together of the paper itself, a close cousin to the 70's MTM drama's opening- titles sequence.The dialogue is sharp and the narrative always taking you somewhere, even if occasionally down a blind alley. There's inventiveness too in the cinematography, with a mixture of lighting styles for the major characters and eye-opening exteriors of the less salubrious parts of Washington. More often than not, political thrillers based in London or Washington throw up symbolic images of the establishment, so it was good to see the direction here eschewing such obvious and lazy trickery. Above all else, it seems to me, the film celebrates the dying art of investigative ""dig-deep"" journalism, given the relentless progress in the here-and-now of bland, faceless ""sound-bite"" on-line news-reporting.In summary then, a cracking, thought provoking and very entertaining take on a genre I thought was all but dead.",State of Play
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,An undeniably superior thriller that fits the big screen,9,6 May 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A bag thief is shot dead in a gutter after a lengthy chase, along with a cyclist who witnessed the killing (who survives.) The next morning a young woman is pushed in front of a train. This woman was having a romantic relationship with Representative Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) who has to announce her death at a press conference. Hot shot journalist Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), who had an affair with Collins's wife, gets on the case, along with an inexperienced but determined younger reporter. And as they do, they uncover a macabre labyrinth of conspiracy including Collins's past in the military and a plot to privatise Homeland Security at home and abroad.However good anything is, if it's a remake or an adaptation, it's always niggling to know that the source material you haven't seen is probably a lot better. State of Play is a Hollywood political thriller adapted from a BBC series that followed the exact same plot line except in London rather than Washington. It fits the big screen perfectly, though, and as Crowe said himself in an interview 'there's a big difference between two hours and six hours...a big difference', so even if the series does turn out to be much better, this stands on it's own perfectly.It's big success is working as a taut, intelligent and riveting thriller with plenty of twists and turns. Following on from the drama Last King of Scotland, Kevin Donaldson proves a dab hand at the thriller genre, getting the best from lead stars Crowe and Affleck, but also supporting stars such as Helen Mirren and Jeff Daniels, in surprising but effective roles, even if I'll never be able to shake Daniels as Marv from Dumb and Dumber.Maybe you've seen the show and think it's better, but even so, this is one of the most thought requiring and clever thrillers to have appeared on the screen in a long while. ****",State of Play
41,dromasca,farewell to the good old fashioned journalism,6,13 December 2012,"What a difference three years make when it comes to telling stories and newspapers and journalist. By the time it was made State of the Play took the plot of a BBC series and carried it over the Ocean melding the story of a newspaper team with big corporate and government conspiracy and congressional corruption, all in a well-paced thriller wrapping. Today it looks more like an elegy to the profession of investigative reporter, to the good old methods of traditional journalism. If the film was made today not only many of the technical details would have been different, but also the focus may not have been that much on the printed press. It may have been the journalist helping the blogger and not the other way. Almost as director Kevin Macdonald after having made a movie about The Last King of Scotland made afterwards a movie about the last great investigative journalist. State of Play is not a bad film, but it does not raise to heights either, and the good parts end by being not exactly the ones planned by the director and producers.The story starts with a double murder and an apparent accident that seem unconnected excepting the fact that they are reported by the same newspaper (a reverence to and quotation of the Washington Post of the 70s, actually the Watergate hotel is one of the settings in the film), although we well know things will change soon. They do indeed, as the subway accident which leads to the death of a Congressman's assistant and the street shooting that opens the film get together in an intrigue that seems to implicate the politician (Ben Affleck) who is investigating a big corporation involved in the private security services oversees while managing an affair with his assistant. While the corruption and sex scandal story develop the focus shifts to the investigation of the news team and especially to the people behind it.The thriller part of the story is reasonably well written, but brings really nothing new. It is more the characters in the newspaper redaction that catch the attention, their methods, the way they balance the duty to expose the truth with their personal feelings, the attitude towards their profession. Russell Crowe is quite convincing as the investigative reporter whose actions walk on the thin line between professional duty and personal feelings like friendship and emotional involvement. He is also a low-tech guy, slightly out of touch not only with the technology but mostly with the morals of the day. Rachel McAdams supports well Crowe as the young blogger who grows with the case, while Helen Mirren as the Chief Editor is as royal as ever and made me regret that her role was not more consistent. I never was a fan of Ben Affleck's acting skills and I did not become one after seeing this film.",State of Play

Affleck is far from convincing as a congressman. He just looks to young and not smart enough to ever be in that position. I think Crowe would have been better as the politician and Affleck as the reporter. And for some reason they hired a well known actress, Rachel Mcadams, to play the other reporter, Della. She really didn't do much and they should have just hired an unknown. I like Robin Wright Penn. She should be in more movies. She just looked out of place as Affleck's wife but that's because Affleck can't pull of that role.FINAL VERDICT: There's quite a few twists at the end.

Despite the very solid cast and a great premise, I never thought this film would turn out that good. That is why I held off seeing this film until very recently. This is a film that has certain plot twists, some predictable and some not. Still, it was enough to keep me very interested in how this film would end.This film is about how one well-known newspaper reporter, Cal uncovers a conspiracy after a personal assistant of a politician was murdered.The acting is very good. It is pretty much the highlight of the film. Russell Crowe played a very convincing Cal. Crowe never disappoints me with any of his characters. The supporting cast led by Helen Mirren and Rachel McAdams are also very good. I did wish that Ben Affleck would show some more emotion on his face, though.Overall, this is a good political thriller. This is a very interesting film to watch. Kevin Macdonald does a good job following up his 2006 feature, The Last King of Scotland. This could have been a better movie though if the editing was better and Ben Affleck showed emotion. I rate this film 8/10.",State of Play
44,secondtake,"Important, timely, a bit routine, with a great (as usual) Crowe",7,6 April 2010,"State of Play (2009)It's not enough to say this is a routinely well made political thriller, or a well made but routine one. Both are true, and yet you have to know that among all the very good if unexceptional performances (including a dissed wife of a congressman played without passion by Robin Penn Wright), there is Russell Crowe. If he hadn't already had a career of varied and terrific performances, you'd point to this one and say, here is a man to look out for. He has talent. He has so much presence of restraint, he helps the film rise about its clichés.Somewhat. To be fair, the plot works, even as the twists get a bit heady and unlikely by the end. There are killings and interrogations, double crosses and evil machine like killers. It moves fast, and it has an edge, it's a good one among many. And I'm sure reviewers (and others) looking for its merits will point out how this movie condemns the already condemned privatization of the military, as Blackwater type corporations (known as PointCorp in this movie, based on a British TV mini-series) kill and control billions of dollars with seeming impunity.Until the wheels not of justice but of the free press arrive. That's actually refreshing and has the smack of truth to it. Where else but the press, or the internet versions of the press (not to mean the blogosphere at all) will we have accountable, researched, verifiable investigations of corruption on this scale? It has just enough earthy realism, and solid acting, to make it meaningful. It's not by any means a beautiful film, which is a shame. There are some great scenes and sets (underground meetings, parking garage chases) and lots of city scenes with all the lights of night that beg for, and often get, commanding or downright riveting photography. Not here. It's symbolic, I think, of the movie as a whole. Functional, smart, capable. Faint praise, but praise.",State of Play

They still stay in touch, but their lives have taken two different paths. Stephen is an up-and-coming politico who has acquired the beautiful wife, Anne (Robin Wright Penn), the spiffy mansion, wealth and prestige. On the flip side, Cal works as a respected but hardly rich reporter for the Washington Globe, where publisher Cameron (Helen Mirren) reigns supreme. One day, as Stephen, who has been investigating the possibly nefarious doings of a Blackwater-type marines-for-hire group, is about to give a press conference, the gallery informs him that one of his committee members, Sonia, has been found dead near the DC subway. Beginning to cry, Stephen stumbles out of the press talk in a daze. That's because, it seems, red-haired, pretty Sonia was having an extra-marital thing with Stevie. Cal and fellow reporter, Della (Rachel McAdams) begin to investigate the case and also the death of two other gentlemen in the region whose demises may be connected. But, will the personal relationship and past that Cal has with both Stephen and Anne get in the way of the search for truth, especially when it comes to the billions of funds made by the ""hired guns"" Stephen was trying to explore? This is a top-notch thriller which may put fans of the genre into a state of euphoria. The script is flat-out terrific, based on a British miniseries, especially in its uncanny skill in blending a great deal of humor amid the chills and thrills. Likewise, the cast is most wonderful, with Crowe, McAdams, Affleck, Mirren, Jason Bateman, Jeff Daniels, Penn, and many others delivering strong, strong performances. Special words of praise should go to Crowe, for his head-turning but carefully nuanced role as a man caught in the middle. As for the movie's production, the sets, costumes, camera work and direction are nearly flawless, except for a ruffled blouse that some fashion diva thought would enhance McAdams' look but which hits 100 on the hideous meter. But, that's small peanuts, as they say.

Accompanied by cub reporter Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), he is drawn deeper into the mystery as murders occur and deadlines impend.The film's very real story gains further authenticity by the fact that 1/3 of the film was shot in D.C.

Oddly enough, the photography in the Making of State of Play in the Bonus Feature DVD is actually more authentic and gritty than the actual final production version of the film itself, unlike how THE HURT LOCKER (2008) was photographed. There are some of the intense moments of action found in ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998) and political intrigue moments elements found in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (1976). STATE OF PLAY is a rather layered movie with a number of intriguing investigative angles and paths which lead to the ultimate resolution of the movie in which the climax is rather sudden and anti-dramatic and even interesting in that a major event in the actual final article written as reported as a result of this investigation, in part, isn't even shown in the movie. This movie is a political thriller with not as much emphasis on action as on the journalistic perspective. The ever present ominous threat of death seems somehow to be overly downplayed in the movie and the presence and involvement of law enforcement is inconsistently present in the script. An entertaining but not quite dramatically captivating as movies such as THREE DAYS OF CONDOR (1975), THE CHANGELING (2008), JFK (1991), BREACH (2007).",State of Play
48,Dr_Coulardeau,Monopolies are the ennemies of Politics,10,19 December 2020,"This is a political thriller, but it is a lot more than just that. It all starts with the killing of a woman pushed in front of an underground train on the Piccadilly Line in London if I am not mistaken as for the line. The hitman got his ""professional"" suitcase snatched by a black purse-snatcher, which then causes some retaliation from the hitman: two people shot, one dead. When the chase for the hitman is on the point of closing manacles on him, a police sniper receives the order to kill him. And we enter the real problem.It is a political intrigue that reveals how deep corporate corruption can penetrate and infiltrate the political top apparatus of a country like Great Britain. A young backbencher MP is responsible for an independent inquiry commission working on the oil industry with, in this oil industry, the main company called U-EX that wants to remain at the top and to dictate the conditions under which the oil industry, that is to say first of all themselves, is treated in the most opaque and privileged situation. Know nothing. Say nothing. See nothing. Show nothing.A spy from this company's lobbying branch is appointed to be the direct assistant to the backbencher MP on a recommendation from the energy senior minister. She is supposed to seduce him, and he is the prey. A banal story of a spy and her prey, and the spy falls in love with her own prey, and what's more, pregnant, and she becomes the secondary prey of the first prey because that is disturbing his own private life, family life, etc. He uses an old contact, in fact, sent to him by the oil company, and this old contact is the hitman, to suggest the backbencher MP who he has known some rather long time ago, that he should get rid of this affair. The prey, since the backbencher MP is the prey of this very hitman, supposedly says no, but does not do what he should have done: go to the police. She is killed and thus the initial spy who had become a faulty pawn, a liability for the oil company by getting sentimentally entangled is eliminated.Banal, except that it is all considered from the point of view of a newspaper and a few journalists, including the one who was the campaign manager of the backbencher MP when he was elected for the first time. Imagine the entanglements coming up here: the journalist is a friend of the backbencher MP. He gets sentimentally involved with his wife, at first in the back of the MP, but then openly. She in turn is acting only to know from the inside what the paper knows about the situation, because she had been informed by anonymous letters a long time before, and she wanted to reconquer her husband by literally blackmailing him with divorce and making him jealous with her affair with someone her husband considers a friend.And we can count the points in the war of the political elite in London against this newspaper, including with pressures on the owner of the paper who intervenes inside the paper to neutralize the investigation. But little by little some of the few participants in the scam who are still alive are trapped by the journalists into telling the real plot and little by little the backbencher MP is more or less forced by stress and pressure to admit he knew the hitman eliminated by a police sniper, that he had been in contact with him before the death of his assistant, that this hitman had suggested getting rid of her, etc. Hence, the hitman being dead, he is the accomplice of the crime and he has to accept his responsibility, hence this criminal investigation in which he is the main person of interest, hence eventually prison in the end.As for the oil company, the main board-member who was overlooking the spy, and subsequently her elimination for sentimental entanglement, finds himself under pressure from the journalists who know a lot more than he would have thought since he was sure everything had been taken care of properly. But in fact, there were some sloppy emails and other inside-communication that should never have existed: monopolies believe they are beyond all scrutiny. So, he commits suicide, and the company will be able to sail through the tempest unharmed. That's western capitalism. Is it typical of capitalism as a whole or only of the West? Difficult to know. But this is quite typical of capitalistic companies in the West: monopoly positions and then lobbying to eliminate all the weak points that could endanger the monopolistic project. We are dealing here with the famous GAFAM + a few more. These companies have divided the whole technological, communicational, and geographical world into zones, and they have specialized their activities so that they are not competing, one against the other, and they collectively keep possible competitors out.Imagine their panic today since similar companies are being built in China that are directly competing with these American monopolies, including in the USA itself. So, they try to break up the said Chinese companies, either by forcing them to bankruptcy or at least recession with tariffs and sanctions or just dismantling some of their branches by forcing them to be sold to American companies who are members or close associates of the GAFAM pirates if not parasites. And the clock is going Tik Tok. The isolationism of Trump has produced a vacuum that is being occupied with little effort by the Chinese, with at the same time some effort on the European side to limit the GAFAM and for European countries and companies to seize their own chance and reconquer some space in a domain where they used to be ahead of the USA, or at least equal to the USA, but since the end of the Vietnam war (1975) the USA has turned what was developed for the Vietnam war (what was to become the Internet) into an absolute imperialistic tool to control the world with Bill Clinton's invention of ICANN, today vastly challenged by the Chinese, and some other countries in Asia, Africa and South or Mesoamerica.This mini-series shows quite well how such companies are ready to act just to keep their privileged situation, even though they have lost footing in more than half the world.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",State of Play
49,zkonedog,A Well-Paced Thriller,8,11 March 2017,"As a fan of the ""political thriller"" genre, I had been very disappointed in the recent fare from that category that I had viewed. It seemed as if either all the answers were given up front (rendering the rest of the film rather boring), or the filmmakers tried to cram every revelation into the last few minutes. Fortunately, ""State of Play"" does neither, instead relying on terrific pacing that will keep you into the plots and guessing all the way to the end.The basic plot of the film centers on two reporters, played by Russell Crowe and Rachel McAdams, for a dying (aren't they all these days?) newspaper. As they begin work on a seemingly simple story involving a murder, they come to find that its threads are much deeper than what some in the government would want them to believe.Though this seems like the standard fare for the political thriller genre, the pacing (an under- used criterion in filmmaking these days) is so excellent that it never feels old or stale. With seemingly each passing minute, a new element is introduced into the lives of either the characters or the unfolding mystery plot. Never once did I find myself glancing at the VCR timer to see how much was left...I was enthralled by the entire story.In the acting department, Crowe turns in another stellar performance as a hard-nosed journalist who doesn't mind doing some dirty work to feed the journalistic machine. McAdams also shows how versatile she can be (how many actresses could pull off Mean Girls, Nicholas Sparks fare, and this sort of thriller in a career?) as Crowe's sidekick who slowly becomes so much more. About the only disappointment is Ben Affleck as a U.S. Congressman...it seems as if he is just kind of sleep-walking through his screen time.The final aspect that pushes this film somewhere between ""above-average"" and ""excellent"" is the plot's grounding in real-life issues. While working for a large newspaper run by an editor (Helen Mirren) who knows what needs to be done for the business to survive in these times, Crowe and McAdams' characters are constantly challenged by how far they should go to uncover their story. The angle isn't overly preachy, which is always a plus, instead trying to show the reality of the situation.Thus, if able, I would give this film a 4.5 star rating. Though it doesn't have quite enough memorable ""oomph"" to be truly a classic (I watched it two weeks ago and already the details are beginning to fade), it delivers a very entertaining two hours filled with twists, turns, and interesting characters.",State of Play

Frye knows that McAffrey and Collins were one time college roommates and hopes he can provide some inside information. When it appears that the opening killings and the woman's death could be related, the two team up to uncover a mystery that could rock the nation.
The hardest part about crafting a good political thriller is making sure the various twists and turns eventually end to a satisfactory ending.However, apparently If you throw the audience too many red herrings they'll quickly lose interest and not care about your heroes.

51,Red-125,"If this is really journalism, that's really sad",7,22 April 2009,"State of Play (2009) directed by Kevin Macdonald, is a great showcase film for Russell Crowe. Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, a Washington, DC reporter, who's seen everything and knows everyone. He lives a solitary existence, subsisting on canned food and whiskey. (Naturally, he drives a battered Saab.)Ben Affleck plays Rep. Stephen Collins, a rising, dynamic politician who is investigating a Blackwater-type corporation. Collins and McAffrey were college friends. Both of them loved a woman named Anne, who married Collins. As the movie opens, three people meet violent deaths. One of them is a young woman who was an aide to Collins.McAffrey goes after the story, and eventually starts to see links between the killings and the work Collins is doing. Loyalty, friendship, and trust all begin to unravel. No one's hands are clean. The question is, Whose hands are dirtiest? Crowe is excellent as McAffrey--cynical, embittered, but still trying to learn the truth. Rachel McAdams plays Della Frye--a young reporter whose part obviously was written into the screenplay to provide a foil for Crowe. (The standard veteran cop/rookie cop pairing.)The great British actress Helen Mirren is wasted in the role of the hard-bitten editor who has to say lines like, ""Well, believe it or not, our corporate owners think that this newspaper should make a profit."" (Not an exact quote, but you get the idea.)Robin Wright Penn portrays Anne Collins. Apparently, some people have thought she was too old to be believable as Collins' wife. I think she was perfect in this small, but demanding, role. The plot of the film was convoluted and confusing. If you look at the message board, you'll see that many viewers had questions along the lines of, ""How did he know what she knew about what they said?"" I started one of the threads. Several people wrote back with cogent answers, some of which were 180 degrees opposite to others. I think a thriller plot can be complex, but it shouldn't be muddled, so I consider this a weakness in the film.Finally, although plot twists are appropriate in a movie like this, I think that the particular final plot twist in State of Play was a cop-out. It was as if the producers got to the edge of the pool, dipped their feet in, and decided that they'd rather not plunge in. Some people have suggested that the producers' decision reflects the reality of journalism today. Maybe so, but it it's true, it's really sad.",State of Play
52,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Investigative journalism angle pushes ""Play"" beyond typical thriller",8,19 April 2009,"Most investigative thrillers focus on detectives digging around for the answers, but ""State of Play"" opts to center around the desperate, miserable and dying newspaper industry. Simply put, the forces and pressures motivating a reporter are not like that on a detective, which makes for a much more unique plot with characters an audience can view as more like themselves. A detective who figures out whodunit is doing his/her job -- a journalist who puts the pieces together is a small-time hero.Russell Crowe stars in one of his more unique roles as a seasoned investigative reporter named Cal McAffrey. Crowe somehow more easily portrays Americans than any Australian or British actor working in Hollywood and he brings a light-hearted spirit to his serious role. His character finds himself in a dangerous place when his personal friendships with a congressman and his wife (Ben Affleck, Robin Wright Penn) come at odds with his job when news breaks that the congressman was having an affair with a girl who recently died in a DC subway accident. McAffrey first tries to protect his friend, but when he sees trends leading to conspiracy, his professional instincts kick in.""Play"" brags a diverse but killer cast. Crowe is the dependable star vehicle, Affleck the ultra- popular movie star who has been scarce lately and Rachel McAdams makes a triumphant return to the screen after a couple years off as a young blogger who assists Crowe. Also appearing in the film are Helen Mirren as the editor, Jeff Daniels as another politician and even Jason Bateman makes a cameo. All of them are talented and have proved so in many different genres, but never have they been together to make a thriller.It's also the first experiment in the genre for the director, Kevin Macdonald (""The Last King of Scotland."") Macdonald keeps this film fast and exciting, generally refusing to use a tripod but not distracting us with shaky camera-work either. He mixes in a lot of close detail shots with scene setters that tell the story at a provocative angle. There are a lot of typical thriller movie conventions used, but he makes it his own. He's a director certainly worth keeping an eye on. Credit must also go to an incredibly well-assembled writing team. Although based on a BBC miniseries of the same name, ""State of Play"" boasts ""Michael Clayton"" creator and penner of the Bourne series Tony Gilroy for the drama and action, ""Shattered Glass"" creator Billy Ray for the journalism expertise and Matthew Michael Carnahan (""Lions for Lambs,"" ""The Kindgom,"") for the political/military end. It's amazing to see how that all plays together so nicely with so many reputable writers. Some of the twists might be more on the extreme side, but it's mostly convincing and exciting the whole way through.""State of Play"" hooks you and keeps you guessing. It tries to keep the characters intimate and worth caring about while also making sure the story picks up velocity. Subplots occasionally get in the way (McAffrey's personal connection to Wright Penn's character among them) but you become pretty easily invested in what's going on and are frightened when what seemed like a nice mystery suddenly gets serious. This is a thriller that is smart and quick and never blows itself out of proportion. It holds its ground and it does so with much talent.Lastly, the film questions the necessary extent of hard-nosed reporting, but also revels in its necessity. Watergate is alluded to as a building where a couple key companies are located. The connection is purposeful -- we're supposed to see the scandal as a fictional modern re- creation of Watergate in terms of how it's reported and uncovered. While films like ""All the King's Men"" glorified the work of journalists, ""Play"" is too stubborn to give them full credit, bringing into the discussion the idea of selling papers and not waiting too long to get all the facts or how the Internet/blogosphere twists the news in different ways. It might not be at the front of your mind while enjoying the film, but it sets it above the overdone detective thriller. ~Steven CSee more on my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",State of Play

54,robert-temple-1,Not as good as the TV mini-series,9,24 October 2009,"This American feature film is loosely based upon the British TV mini-series of the same title shown in 2003, which featured two spectacular star performances by Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald, both of whom are one hundred percent mesmerising, whereas no one in this film is. Here their two characters are replaced with insipid performances by Helen Mirren, who tries hard to tough it out despite lack of dialogue and opportunity and a much less helpful set (Nighy was able to parade up and down dominating a whole floor of a building, Mirren is shut in like somebody who is under quarantine, so that there is barely room to move her arms and legs), and the boring Rachel McAdams, who also has no help from the script and director but in any case puts me to sleep just looking at her. She seems to think that having wide-open eyes will get her somewhere, but it just doesn't work. And she has no sex appeal either. In terms of 'appeal', Helen Mirren who is old enough to be her grand-mother has more than McAdams does. Why is this? She should stop eating porridge in the mornings or whatever it is she does that makes her so dull, start eating steak or something, forget the presence of the camera, get some more gumption, have some bad experiences, cry and sob, get her heart broken a few more times, let some patina form. She is lacking time in the barrel. She needs 'age'. The ever-fascinating Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck do very well in their roles, full marks, but that's no surprise. When did they ever not do very well in their roles? Robin Wright Penn, who can be intolerably boring, manages to be lively and interesting this time, well done. She has obviously pulled herself together and is moving forward after some lapses as an actress. As a high-intensity thriller, this film is a success, and those who do not know how much better it could have been, and who never saw the original mini-series (though it is readily available on DVD and is highly recommended), will think it is terrific. 'All that stuff happens', as we know very well. Conspiracies based in Washington or London are all to be believed, as so many of them are real, and even if they aren't, we believe them anyway because all politicians have lost our trust so completely that we believe them to be capable of anything. Why didn't the producers let Paul Abbott, who scripted the brilliant mini-series, write this feature? It would have been much, much better. Did they think he did not know enough about Washington? Anyone who has ever been to the reptile house in the zoo knows enough about Washington.

55,Turfseer,Run-of-the-mill thriller further bogged down by plot holes and conspiracy theories,4,2 September 2010,"I haven't seen the 2003 British mini-series the American version is based on, but I understand the screenwriters pared down the story considerably to the point where 'State of Play' is virtually all plot with little character development. Take the Russell Crowe Cal McAffrey protagonist—he's a bit of a scruffy Luddite whose cubicle at work is a mess and he drives an old beat up Saab. He's pitted against the Rachel McAdams Della Frye blogger and they're supposed to have some chemistry together with the old style reporter going toe to toe with the gossip driven online maven. I wanted to see more of McAffrey's idiosyncrasies but he along with Della get so caught up in the machinations of the plot, that there's no time to find out anything about their personalities. Yes, McAffrey has an affair with Anne Collins ( Robin Penn Wright), the wife of his old friend Representative Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) but it's all pretty standard stuff and by the time the film is over, we wonder if any of the characters have any kind of inner life.As a plot driven movie, 'State of Play' has enough plot holes to seriously question the entire enterprise. Take for example, the murder of Collin's attractive assistant, Sonia Baker. We never see how she meets her end in the train station and how can the news media immediately assume it was a suicide? We do find out later that she was murdered but in a crowded train station, weren't there any witnesses? Nor is the police investigation ever shown. In real life, the news media would not at all be so quick to assume that Baker took her own life. No one is seen questioning this view which would be the opposite of what would occur in reality. I did read on Wikipedia that the producers were not allowed to show any scenes of violence in the train station as its owners strictly prohibited any association of the station with violent behavior.Now Cal manages to obtain photos of Sonia from some homeless woman whose fellow addict was shot dead by the psycho soldier who used to work for military contractors in Iraq. I refuse to believe that a couple of bumbling crack-heads could so easily boost a briefcase from a soldier who is supposed to be some sort of professional assassin. Do we ever see that scene where the briefcase is stolen? Of course not! It's just too easy and convenient a way for Cal to obtain his next lead—Sonia's phone number is on the crack-head's cell phone!As for Representative Collin's assertion that PointCorp, the military contractor he's been investigating in his congressional hearings, has taken over the nation's security both overseas and DOMESTICALLY, where is the proof of that? It sounds like that the films' scenarists approve of the assumption they place in the mouth of Ben Affleck's mercurial Congressman. 'State of Play' is now reduced to another one of those silly Oliver Stone-like conspiracy flicks, where shady quasi-governmental agencies are linked to the nastiest of intentions!What about this PointCorp insider who so easily points Cal in the direction of Sonia's assassin? If PointCorp's tentacles reach so far and wide, wouldn't this insider have been under surveillance? Wouldn't they have had Cal under surveillance and realized that their security was being compromised by one of their own? The screenwriters pull the insider out of a hat which ultimately gives the filmmakers an excuse to stage the Cal-Army Psycho stalking scene in the parking garage.Through Della's side of the investigation, she figures out by exploring the purloined photos, that oily PR executive Dominic Foy (well played by Jason Bateman), worked for a PointCorp subsidiary and can connect Sonia to PointCorp. Cal's unethical side is exposed when he blackmails Foy into spilling the beans.State of Play's ending just failed to pay off. Collins finally admits to his old buddy Cal that he had suspicions that Sonia was working for PointCorp. He hires an old Army buddy who used to work for PointCorp but now hates them (not exactly sure why). The buddy, Army Corporal Bingham, turns out to be the psycho assassin. Collins insists that he had no idea that Bingham would kill Sonia. So if that's the case, why is Collins arrested at the end of the film? Where is the proof that he actually intended to murder Sonia? If Bingham was acting on his own, then can Collins really be considered liable for Sonia's death? Finally, there's the ludicrous finale where Bingham attempts to shoot Cal on an open street as the police close in. He could have finished Cal off at any point before the final scene but chooses to let himself be trapped and ultimately gunned down by the police (how about taking Cal out from a distance in a high-rise, just as he killed the pizza deliveryman who was just waking up from the coma in the hospital?).If you're willing to suspend your disbelief about the implausible scenes in 'State of Play', you might enjoy the film for the capable acting and numerous twists and turns in the plot. Those 'twists and turns' are for the most part not particularly believable at all, but 'Play' will indeed hold your interest—in a run-of-the-mill sort of way!",State of Play
56,Chris Knipp,Stop the presses!,8,7 May 2009,"With State of Play, the Scottish director Kevin Macdonald (of The Last King of Scotland), who has documentary roots (Touching the Void), has made a powerful American political thriller out of the excellent 6-hour British miniseries of the same name. A young woman falls under a DC subway train and dies. It seemed like suicide, but evidence reveals she might have been pushed. She was working for a congressman in an investigation (in the BBC version, it was about energy companies; here it's Blackwater-style corporate mercenary dispensers). A seedy character also dies that day. His death is linked to the woman's, and she turns out to have been in an affair with the congressman. (Not only that; she was a kind of mole for the mercenary firm. But that emerges later.) In disarray, he turns up at the doorstep of a seasoned newspaper reporter who's an old friend from college. The newspaperman is torn between protecting his pal and unearthing the hot story. He remains loyal, but in this time of print journalism under siege, this is very much a story about the power of the press to unearth information the cops can't get.This American version of State of Siege is more intense, more serious (there is virtually no humor, while the BBC series was relieved momvnet of dry English wit), and, despite being crammed into just over two hours, is more complicated. It puts across several currently newsworthy themes. The BBC miniseries dealt with corporate meddling in politics, murder, and adultery. This time the Blackwater-like firm brings in the hysteria of the ""war on terror"" and the growing confusion of government service with for-profit capitalism.Moreover instead of the urbane Bill Nihy, the most famous thespian in the TV piece, the editor is a close-cropped Helen Mirren, whose ""Washington Globe"" has recently been bought by a media corporation. While Nihy's character was just trying to save money, play by the rules, and still get a great story, Mirren's is rather crudely jealous when the New York Post gets a fluffy but related scandal story that will sell a lot of papers, and there are hints at the offset that the Internet is steadily encroaching, though how we will get hard news with only bloggers at desks and no reporters on the beat remains a mystery.The Americans have made an intelligent, relevant thriller. The BBC one was good, but not up to the level of Trafik, which benefits from its dynamic interpolation of sequences set in Pakistan, Germany, and England. State of Play in either form is at best claustrophobic. Besides being over-stuffed with plot elements, Maddonald's film is star-studded, beginning with a long-haired, portly, scruffy, and excellent Russell Crowe as Cal McAffrey, the reporter. Crowe seems far more into his role here than he was as the detached CIA boss in the less memorable Body of Lies. He wields his questions, his notepads, and his aged desktop with authority. Ben Affleck is sterling as Stephen Collins, the congressman and old pal. Affleck looks right in a dark suit and has the tough but naive manner of a young politician.The movie gets a little tangled up with itself with Cal's female sidekick, Della Fryle (Rachel McAdams), also Della, but Smith, in the TV version. This new Della is a coddled blogger for the Web version of the paper, who gets a nice salary and lots of up-to-date gadgets, but has never dirtied her hands with journeyman reportage. Somehow she slips by sheer enthusiasm into being Cal's risk-taking partner, when all she has played with hitherto is gossip and commentary. How is that?A disappointment is the character Dominic Foy, a PR man both implicated in the recruitment of the murdered Sonia and, unknown to Collins, her friend. Foy's relationship with Sonia is not as well developed here. Moreover Marc Warren, the British Foy, was a wonderfully seedy and flamboyant character. ""Arrested Development's"" Jason Bateman is a good actor, but his part contributes to this new version's general feeling of being sweatier and shorter on charm or wit.In the movie, Della and Cal have a platonic flirt, which presumably symbolizes the winning over of blogging by the lure of solid reporting. There was none of that in the BBC series, in which the appealing but lightweight John Simm (as Cal) had a serious sexual affair with Collin's wife Anne (the beautiful and elegant Polly Walker), a plot strain perhaps somewhat over-extended. That was cut out here to make way for mercenary heavies (and to get out in 127 minutes). This high-powered ""story,""or ""case,"" as the chief detectives in both versions insist it should be called, has no time now for amorous dalliance or indeed any forays into bedroom or kitchen. What it does have time for is an impassioned declaration by Congressman Collins at the committee hearing about the commercialization of defense. He has found out that ""Point Corp"" (the Blackwater surrogate) is planning to move wholesale into Homeland Security and make that all for-profit too.Note that this new shorter version was penned from Paul Abbott's original by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy, and Billy Ray, excellent screenwriters and script doctors all, but given Gilroy's tendency revealed in his own Duplicty to over-spin plot, there may have been too many broths brought to a boil here. Still, the status of the press as a Web-endangered species and the commercializing of government service are important themes that aren't at all irrelevant. Macdonald's documentary experience probably helped him get across so much information in so little time without confusing us. It's a pity though that the movie plays exciting new cards onto the table only to let them be swept away at the end when the corporate conspiracy is hastily folded into the prosecution of a single man. Ending with the publication of the news story about that is a kind of cop-out.",State of Play
57,thinker1691,""" This is my country and without it, I'd rather be nothing """,7,5 October 2009,"There is so much corruption stewing in Washington D.C. one cannot go a single day in the life of the city without uncovering dirt on congressional Representatives or employees. If one is a reporter, he does not have to try very hard to discover a sordid story involving a Senator, Congressman, sex scandal or illegal corruption. When such a story breaks, all the righteous principals targeted suddenly recall their ethics, family and most importantly their alibis for the night in question. That is the basis for this movie called "" State of Play. "" Two college friends recall their early friendship as they suddenly find themselves embroiled in a suicide Sex-Scandal. Rep. Stephen Collins, (Ben Affleck) is an up and coming Congressman who is apparently being smeared by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Once the story breaks, he seeks out his college friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe,) to help him stem the smear story. Reluctantly, he begins a half-hearted effort to safeguard his friend, when two people are murdered, seemingly unrelated. In addition, when NcAffrey's editor demands a complete investigation, McAffrey allows a young cub reporter to cover the story instead. Unfortunately, one of the murder victims does not die and the cub reporter is nearly killed, McAffrey wants to know why and if his former friend is in any way responsible. The story escalates when several other killings take place and corporate mercenaries and assassins try to cover up corruption and political interests. When McAffrey becomes personally interested and threatened by the Det. Donald Bell (Harry Lennix) for with holding vital evidence, everyone on the newspaper becomes involved. The energy exhibited by the cast is what makes this movie exciting and believable. Indeed, there is much to be said for both the directing and intriguing script. Although, Crowe displays the shabby appearance of a scruffy, ill-kept street hippie, his talent for an exceptional performance is in no way diminished. ****",State of Play
58,freemantle_uk,An Excellent Thriller,9,5 August 2010,"The original TV series State of Play was a hit for the BBC, showing the talents of it's actors, the writer and director. It was a complex thriller that mixed politics, journalism and corrupt corporate influence. When Hollywood wanted to remake it into a film the big fears were what's the point and that the film makers would dumb it down. But luckily the director Kevin Macdonald and team of screenwriters have done a great job setting the action in Washington DC and cutting running time to 2 hours.In Washington D.C. two seemingly unrelated events happen in the space of a few hours, the murder of a teenage junkie and shooting of a pizza delivery man in Georgetown, and the apparent suicide of a Congressional researcher Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer). Journalist Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is assigned to report on the murder whilst blogger Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) reports that Miss Baker was having an affair with Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck). Collins is investigating the activists of PointCorp, a private defence contractor who has been using mercenaries in Iraq and Afghanistan. Quickly the reporters and the Congressman work together to prove that PointCorp and many other private defence contractor plan to work together to monopolise America's defence contracts.It was going to be a challenge to turn 6 hours of programming into a 2 hour film and of course subplots had to be shorten or cut. But luckily the producers hired an excellent team of writers, Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom), Tony Gilroy (The Bourne Trilogy), Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) and Billy Ray (Breach). They do a great job transferring the action to American politics, showing how groups with shared interests forming Political Action Committees (PAC) to lobby American politicians, usually groups with deep pockets. There was also updating the plot to private contractor in the war of terror, how these companies have profit from the conflict and ruining America's reputation. They is a great complex plot, linking politics and the media, that too much private interest in government is a terrible idea (even thought extreme right winger in America would want to see that happen). There are ideas about the media as well, with tabloidisation of respected papers (like the Washington Post) wanting to focus on stories that could say papers, celebrity stories and sex scandals then political or business events. It is link to the ideas of the disintegration of China Walls, where the ownership and advertisers of a newspaper starts to interfere with the journalist side of things. The writers, director and actors also expose the idea of journalist ethics where they get too close to their source.Macdonald is a talented director; his background in documentary filmmaking was clear, using hand-held camera and playing his cameras in many different locations. It gave the film the feeling that you were in the room with the characters and unlike Paul Greengrass with his direction of Green Zone it looked professionally directed. There are also some shooting in an intense setting, where you get to see the action (against a big strength over Mr. Greengrass). The film is given a 12 rating but it is on the upper scale of the rating, like Casino Royale, the Dark Knight and X-Men 2 where there is blood and people getting hurt. MacDonald should be a leading contender to direct a Bond film (along with my personal choice of Christopher Nolan, Alfonso Cuaron and Oliver Hirschbiegel). Macdonald also brings in an intense feeling like All the President's Men, with 2 skilled reporters working closely together to find out the conspiracy.Macdonald assembles an excellent cast, despite all the casting changes. Crowe gives an unglamourous as an overweight, almost hippy like journalist who is committed to his story and his friends. He avoids playing the role like John Sims did in the original series. Affleck gives one of his best performance as Stephen Collins and his career resurgence continues. McAdams shows that 2009 was her year staring in 3 big films and she very good in State of Play. She had fine chemistry with Crowe and she is one the edge of true stardom. She needs more roles like this. I am however a little critical of the casting of Helen Mirren: I would have thought an American would be the editor of a Washington Post like paper and she should have either had an American accent or the filmmakers should have cast an American actor.An excellent thriller with a real brain behind it.

59,dfranzen70,Are the journos pimps or the product?,7,7 May 2009,"n this complicated but slightly above-average political thriller, a rumpled newspaper reporter (Russell Crowe) unearths a conspiracy involving an old friend, a sitting congressman (Ben Affleck); the politician’s murdered mistress; a private-security corporation; low-rent drug dealers; and adultery. Crowe’s grim, appealing performance, along with Rachel MacAdams’ turn as a plucky blogger, keep the energy amped up just enough to hold interest, although ultimately the use of red herrings and a deus ex machina prevent this movie from being all that it can be.A thief is killed in an alley; the next day, a pretty congressman’s aide is killed in a D.C. train station. Disheveled old-school newsman Cal McAffrey (Crowe) soon discovers a connection between the two, but Della Frye (MacAdams), a blogger for the paper, steals his thunder with a sensationalistic piece on the paper’s website. Realizing they are pursuing different angles of the same story, McAffrey and Frye join forces, descending into the seamy underbelly of the capital city. Who had Sonia Baker killed, and why? The answers, naturally, will expose a highly intertwined network of corruption from Rep. Collins and outward.In many ways, this movie is just like any other conspiracy-in-Washington thriller; there’s twists and turns, some plausible and some not, and just when you think you have it all figured out, BAM, you’re wrong, sorry, Charlie. That’s really standard issue for this kind of thing, all set against quick DC exterior shots and to a pulse-pounding percussion soundtrack.And many of the elements of the movie seem awfully familiar. Like how all politicians are corrupt. And how there must always be some ink-stained wretch tenaciously clinging to pre-Internet values. Oh, and a tense chase-and-fight in an underground garage. And a tough-as-nails editor (here played with profane Britishness by Dame Helen Mirren).But what State of Play brings to the table is a passionate, earthy Russell Crowe, who instills a real sense of justice and good old fashioned journalism, even as the intricate web inevitably ensnares him as well. Crowe’s gravitas makes the movie, really; try to picture a comparative thespian lightweight, like Nicolas Cage, or a movie star, like Tom Hanks or Brad Pitt, in this role, and you can’t. Crowe’s Cal isn’t pretty to look at, which lends the character credibility, and his single-minded pursuit of what he believes is the truth - despite his own conflict of interest. All that matters is the story, Cal McAffrey thinks, and as he steadfastly pursues the truth, he gladly uses those who would be his friends.Crowe is half the story, however; the story itself is the other half. While the emphasis is on the whodunit angle of the caper, under that is the role that the media plays in investigating powerful conspiracies. For as much as McAffrey wishes to believe he’s just doing his job, it’s obvious that he’s pretending that his own involvement in the story has nothing to do with the story itself. This moral ambiguity, which seems plain in real life, helps color the movie in a way that definitely does set the movie apart from others of its ilk.The supporting cast is also worth mentioning. MacAdams is very good as the green, wide-eyed rookie (”don’t show those dewy cub-reporter eyes to me!” bellows Mirren); Mirren herself is gritty as the chief, although I’m not sure why her character has a British accent here. She couldn’t do an American one? (Yes, I’m aware the movie is based on a BBC series, but still.) Also showing up are Jeff Daniels as a calm fellow politico and Robin Wright Penn, in a subtle, endearing role as the congressman’s wife. Oh, and Ben Affleck, but sadly he’s by far the nadir of the entire film; vapid, bland, and useless, Affleck should have been replaced by someone with a personality.",State of Play

If one accepts the premise of this movie at face value, one will reasonably conclude that the only person who can solve a complex crime is a ... newspaper journalist! Ugh! Also, this movie is proof that you cannot have a character actor, which is what Russell Crowe has become, playing the lead. After his mind-numbing performance as the boxer James J. Braddock, in a movie that had to be one of the worst sports movies ever made, (Mr. Braddock was married, had children, had financial difficulties, actually had a REGULAR job, lived somewhere in New Jersey ... wow, what a story!), Mr. Crowe has never been the same. It's a shame because he is a great actor. Oh what a crummy movie. Why was this movie made? This movie challenges even the most intrepid movie buff to stay awake. If this movie is trying to be another All The President Men, it fails. This has to be Russell Crowe's worst movie. Nothing in this movie is good. Dumb story, poor acting, clichéd, contrived, unoriginal and above all, BORING. Russell Crowe proves that he is no Robert Redford and that the political who-done-it genre is passé. A murder?

This sounds very generic but the roles are at least played with enough authenticity by the actors to grab some attention.While the acting is solid and especially well done by Russell Crowe, the rest of the movie is too worn out to stand out. In the last years, there have been tons of better conspiracy flicks such as the Bourne series. This one isn't worth your attention. It's okay for a loan or a relaxed view on television if nothing else is on that attracts your interest but I wouldn't recommend a purchase or multiple viewings of this flick.The movie is a shortened version of a more detailed series that had been done with different actors a few years ago but the story still manages to have some lengths and overall lacks dynamic and originality. This movie should have been more compact, more surprising and a little bit darker to convince but the story is told from a rather boring and neutral third person view.

The action is not high octane or tense, and to be honest there is not a lot of action in the film, but that's okay, it didn't call for or need big ol' action sequences, it was a lot more of a tense thriller and figuring out who done what.

His young co-worker Della Frye covers the accident where Sonia Baker, an assistant and, more importantly, lover to congressman Stephen Collins died. The accident is big news as Collins is about to spearhead an investigation into how Pointcorp seems to take over more and more of US security, a multibillion dollar business. And Collins is also Mc Affrey's college room-mate, which complicates matter greatly when the two stories suddenly seem connected.Comments: It's a good complicated story, based on a British miniseries. But even though it's hard to fit everything in in just two hours nothing feels left out in the movie. It's a pretty big and complex story, and the movie takes it's time to develop it good. In fact, it almost does too good a job of it, as it was a little too obvious to leave room and space for an upcoming twist. And there are a few new developments throughout the movie, and even if they're not always exactly surprising, they does keep the story interesting and entertaining.

I can't remember one single title of a good movie he's been in in the last ten years. what? do you say Ben Affleck isn't that old? oh, yeah, right: that means he cannot act. big deal. he can't act. it's not a secret. some actors earn their money with comedies. that's away of living all right, but it isn't really groundbreaking. no, if you want your name in history, you must be original when you act in a movie. on the big no-list: comedies. they destroy your potential acting qualities. so now here's the big surprise: this isn't a comedy and Ben Affleck plays an important role in it. that's fantastic news! what we can't ignore is that Russell Crowe is also present in the movie. so Ben Affleck, who cannot act, joins a movie with Russell Crowe, a great actor who's already in the top ten of the best actors ever (okay, I'm joking off course, but Crowe really is good in all his movies). Crowe and Affleck fight for our attention in almost every scene, so no matter what character they play, it's like battle of the giants. we know already Affleck will lose, but it's still cool to see him act. it reminds me of Jay and Silent Bob. those movies aren't quality, but funny. everyone should have seen them to make up their minds about the comedy genre in general. I talk about this, because State of Play is the All the President's Men for the youtube generation. that says a lot: State of Play is almost perfect. so why did they take Crowe as well as Affleck in this movie gem? maybe to see who can act and who can't. the only problem with Crowe is: I like to see him act, but after 20 minutes, I have seen it. I don't want to look anymore. Crowe is a great actor, but he can only express one personality. Affleck, however, isn't that good as actor, but he can use every emotion he needs to convince us at the screen. McAdams walks around to show us stereotypes: actresses will always walk around. I think it's a shame, because women have the right to act as good as actors. so why did Rachel act as if she's sitting on a sofa with a drink in her hands, enjoying the movie itself? I'm a big fan of McAdams, she's hot! but she doesn't act good in this picture. and hey, that's not all: I told you this movie was good, right? well, the first half is. the second half, I was thinking 'oh my god, how is it possible I spent money on this? it takes away precious time of my life!' even Crowe couldn't save this.

State of Play is constructed well, paced well. It has some decent characterization, good dramatic momentum and is presented coherently enough despite all the names and places that get thrown around.The film is of a good length as well, but perhaps maybe five minutes too long.The one mistake that was made was the decision to throw in a classic very last minute twist. It was as if the makers felt so compelled to follow the formula that they couldn't simply indulge in a slightly more noble sort of ending. I felt like I was being reminded that this is a political thriller, It just took me out of the movie a bit.All thriller need suspense of some kind, and Director Kevin MacDonald plays his cards in the right places. His construction of a cat and mouse sort of scenario in a lower level parking lot was handled beautifully. I don't think I've seen such a frightening looking parking lot since P2.

The look like they are downplays but they are not. The characters are not so deeply developed, though. And the focus is not so deep on the rest of the characters beside Cal and Stephen. I personally like the stable fast pace of how the mystery unfolded.Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck did a great job here, while McAdams provided just enough for her character. Helen Mirren was able to give this movie some added toughness, even from a not so significant character, which is nice. A 7 out of 10 is solid from me.",State of Play
70,Matt_Layden,"Well written and acted, a very smart thriller.",7,9 May 2010,"A congressmen's mistress is murdered and his friend, who is also a reported, decides to investigate the crime. During the investigations, he and his team uncover a political conspiracy and their lives are now at stake. State of Play is a smart adult thriller that is never boring, or exhausting. It can be compared to All The Presidents Men, but relevant for today's themes and issues. The film takes some sides in a political ground, but to me it never really harms the film. I was so caught up in the investigation and the characters that I didn't seem to care for what the film's themes and messages are.Russell Crowe leads the film, in a role that really lets him shine. He manages to be sloppy, brilliant and comedic all in one. Rachel McAdams, who I have a crush on, continues to prove why she is a smart and talented actress. She won't fall from grace like her Mean Girls co-star Lohan. Ben Affleck is in another role that I can tolerate. It seems that when the guy is in a supporting role or behind the camera, he shines. His boyish looks and every guy attitude is gone, but he still has that young up and coming attitude that actually suits this role. Crowe really does stand out in this film, I've never been a huge fan of his, but this is definitely an under-appreciated role. The film is easy to keep track of, despite it's many twists and turns while unravelling the mystery. There are even way too many characters, but we are still able to know who's who, who's responsible for what and why. The script is clear and concise and the direction suits that as well. Nothing fancy, just bare bones story telling and a director that wants to tell that story. The film is thrilling, despite lacking in any chase sequences. One scene in which our lead is stuck in a parking lot with another man and a gun is intense, even if we've seen all of it before. State of Play is a mature film that audience seemed to skip. Which makes it even more of a gem to watch. It has strong performance and a story that doesn't feel cheap. There are subplots that do seem a bit out of place, just to add some more characterization to these people. But I can get past it. State of Play is easily recommended.",State of Play
71,pc95,Comes off Flat,6,23 May 2009,"Although not a dud, ""State of Play"" comes off somewhat flat. The story starts off well, but doesn't really build into something. Instead we're thrown layers of details and facts without much motivation. Acting was so-so with Crowe better than average, but Affleck and McAdams below satisfactory. There are relationships and scenes that are superfluous as well including (spoiler) the whole affair and history with the Robin Penn Wright character and Cal. The movie drags toward the end, including an anticlimactic twist haphazardly thrown in, as well as some patriotic gibberish from the ""corporate"" killer. Probably the best character was served up pimpy Jason Bateman eating up line-after-line of trashy conversation. Maybe worth a rental, if you have patience for it.",State of Play
72,lewiskendell,A D.C. political thriller that's better than most.,7,26 June 2010,"""A good soldier fights for his country...and his friends. But these guys, they want to make it all about the money. You want to live in a world like that?""State of Play is a solid political thriller. It doesn't move beyond the shadowy corporate conspiracies and government corruption that is so common in this genre, but thanks to a combination of a great cast, good writing, and solid camera work, it's one of the better entries (along with The International, which was more slanted towards action) that I've seen recently. This is very much an ensemble cast, though Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdama and Russell Crowe are clearly the leads. Three excellent leads, as it happens. I've never been so impressed with Rachel McAdams, as I was in this movie. Russell Crowe once again plays a reporter so well that it seems like he could stop acting and get a job at a newspaper, tomorrow. And Ben Affleck has totally made me forget about some of the horrible movies that he's been a part of in the past. The man is a good actor. The rest of the cast is made up of such notable names as Hellen Mirren, Robin Wright, Viola Davis, Harry Lennix, and Jason Bateman. Each of them shines in their roles, no matter how major or minor.None of those actors could salvage State of Play if it was an incoherent mess, as so many of these movies unfortunately tend to devolve into. Luckily, that's not the case. The story does have one too many twists at the end, but otherwise it's clear, interesting, easy to follow, and makes sense. Director Kevin Macdonald seems to have a good grasp on the fact that a movie can be intelligent and involving  without being a labyrinthine mess.   This is also somewhat of a love letter to newspapers and the old-timey journalism that seems to be vanishing in today's blog and everything-online oriented world. The newspaper office is largely where the mysteries are uncovered, pondered, and solved, and that gives State of Play a rather unique place amongst the countless movies that fall under the thriller umbrella.",State of Play

In fact the pacing is terrible, and the movement from scene to scene difficult to follow, until it at last sinks in that the scenes are never going to really add up to anything like an interesting whole. It's not simply that threads are left dangling - they were never intended to be tied together in the first place. The whole film stinks of red herring - or more accurately, dead herring.Meanwhile, clichés abound, unrelieved by any new insight or point of view.As for the visual jokes in the background - like the poster of the blonde seen through a window with a ketchup stain so she looks shot through the head, or the fact that the Crowe character is dressed to remind us of the detective he played in American Gangster, while the black detective is as dapper as the Denzel Washington character in that much better film - oh, please - these were just annoying and pointless.Finally, in a film that should have been about the lack of accountability that plagues both our political system and our media, the final notice of the film is the film-makers' own denial of responsibility, an unwillingness to take a final stand on any of the issues it presents.A truly cowardly and depressing piece of film.",State of Play

Joined by young political blogger Della Frye, Cal races against time and deadlines to solve the murder, which may be only a small part of a much larger crime.STATE OF PLAY is like a modern version of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and I'm willing to admit the former is a far more engrossing political thriller. What I liked a lot about this film is the swift direction. One scene comes right after another with a snappy but connected feel and the film doesn't feel fast paced at all.It's also good to see a Hollywood film in which there are characters we are willing to invest our time in. Russell Crowe may not give an Oscar-worthy performance here but it's sure damn good, if you ask me. The beautiful and talented Rachel McAdams keeps up with the Crowe all the way. Although slightly underused, Helen Mirren is great as always. I also thought Ben Affleck was decent in the role, although he's the weakest of the bunch. Oh, and let's not forget Robin Wright. She's really good in this.The script is also well written for the actors to work with. It's just an ingenious film overall. As an audience member, I was captivated all the way through. I didn't find a dull moment in the film. One thing I didn't like about the film, however, is that there were one too many plot twists, especially during the latter half of the film.

How many balls are in the air? How many incidents are converging at once? How many decisions need to be made and some dependent on another decision? What to do when you think you know what is going on? The hype over this movie was unbelievable. Some were running to steal the Oscar. Overall, this was okay. I didn't see any great performances from the top stars. They did okay too. Nothing in here was Oscar quality except for one performance. That being from Jason Bateman who was truly a breath of fresh air. The guy is a natural in whatever he is in. Am I the only one to see that? The next really good performance was from Jeff Daniels and we should see more of him in these kind of roles (political or some such). He has that political backroom kind of demeanor. Very good. In thrillers, which some call this, we should get to experience a good car chase. Did not happen. We also get to see some pretty good CGI. Not this time. I missed them. I would call this a very good Made-For-TV drama, but not a thriller. Kind of bland.The only real problem I had with this movie was that there was too much detail. You had murders, conspiracy, cover-up, Homeland Security on thin ice, kickbacks, paybacks, mercenary contractors running amuck, a big newspaper in deep trouble and so on. And, each one just mentioned had a myriad of detail. It was just too much. And, get this: there was an underlying plot whereby the mercenary contractors would take over all security for the United States. The movie didn't commit to go there, but hinted at it and got out.

He gives a good enough performance but is far too young to be believable as Crowe's college roommate or Robin Wright Penn's husband, not his fault but a major casting error nonetheless. Originally Crowe and Affleck's parts were to be filled by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton a far more simpatico pairing the obvious disparity in the leads ages distracts throughout the film.

And Rachel McAdams looking tastier than Christmas dinner.A murdered congressional aide is linked to Republican Congressman, Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck, playing it straighter than Tom Cruise's public persona) in a sex scandal that leads to questions regarding his links to a no-bid, war-profiteering contractor, PointCorp (think: Blackwater, renamed Xe). A former roommate of Collins, investigative reporter, Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe, playing it scruffier than Nick Nolte on a bad hair day), uncovers what looks like a conspiracy.For those uninterested in political intrigue, there's spinner Rachel McAdams (whose only conspiracy is to commit hotness), as McAffrey's naif reporter chum, Della Frye, wearing dresses that nicely accentuate her high, tight a-cups, looking cuter than a Hello Kitty backpack on a 16-year-old girl scout.Writer Mathew Michael Carnahan (LIONS FOR LAMBS, 2007) once again displays his uncanny Beltway underbelly knowledge and knack for conjuring compelling stories from dry political duplicity. Kevin McDonald directs STATE OF PLAY (which could have easily become a talky mystery) like an action thriller.Russell Crowe, looking faintly like Jesus, plays something almost non-existent in this 24-hour-news-cycle world - an investigative reporter. Taste the syllables in your empty mouths, news media; remember when this species was not extinct? No wonder he looks like a martyr.Crowe's acting chops simply beats the rest of the cast to death. Deep in The Method, he appears in his shoddy car, on the way to a crime scene, singing loudly to Irish beer-drinking songs, his back seat a scandal of wrappers and paper cups. He is paunchy, unshaven; his cubicle reminiscent of paper-age pack rats, his apartment the messiest in the world - yet his mind is like a shark's tooth.It is not surprising that democrat Affleck (the only man brave enough to satire progressive demagogue Keith Olbermann on SNL) is playing a Republican, and it is certainly not surprising to any Republicans that he is busted in a sex scandal; what is surprising is that his Republican congressman actually cares about The People, trying to uncover corporate corruption, rather than being molded by it, which would effectively make him a pariah at the All-White All-Male Racist Repub Country Club.Helen Mirren plays the newspaper's ribald editor, showing us what The Queen would sound like with the tongue of a construction worker. She only wants the dirt on congressional philandering, while McAffrey pleads more time to go deeper into the story.But maybe McCaffrey just wants to go deeper into something else, as we discover a past affair between him and the congressman's wife, Anne (Robin Wright Penn). At one point, he tells Della he is following a lead and slinks off to have a drink with Anne.Jason Bateman is PR man, Dominic Foy, a pimpster for richies, playing the same distracted, ad-libbing eccentric he has made a hilarious career of. Through him, we discover everyone is in collusion (again, like THAT would surprise anyone in politics!).A PointCorp insider tells McCaffrey about corporate operating procedures: ""They do whatever the f*ck they want; they answer to no one. It's a fundamental restructuring of our domestic intelligence policy - the privatization of homeland security, billions of dollars... wrath-of-God money."" Is he talking about Blackwater/Xe? Of course he is. The filmmakers don't go too far to disguise PointCorp's analogy to George W. Bush's real world, no-bid murdering mercenaries; the logo even resembles Blackwater's.STATE OF PLAY never mentions what government is in power, because - as we have seen with the new spineless Obama administration - it doesn't matter what government is in power for government misfeasance to continue. (Nine months into Obama's reign, Bush's criminality still rains: still Iraq, still illegal surveillance, still Afghanistan, still Guantanamo, still no health reform, still no torture investigations, still no Bush, Rove, Cheney, Woo indictments for war crimes...) STATE OF PLAY brings together many suspenseful story strands and clacks them into place neatly, but in the end, backs away from its high level of crime, bringing the story down to one man's bad decisions which only made it look like corporate conspiracy. Collins, who seemed so sincere, was only looking out for his own interests - That's Our Republican!Also McCaffrey asserts something demonstrably incorrect: ""Through all this gossip and speculation that permeates people's lives, I still think they know the difference between real news and bullsh*t, and they're glad that someone cares enough to get things on the record and print the truth."" No, they don't know. Why else would Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck still be on air? How else did networks garner ratings by talking about Palin's wardrobe for a week? How else did George W. Murderer crouch for two felonious terms in the Oval Egg? Yet this movie's construction and its performances are superb.

Luckily for him,he's got one ace in the hole:that being gruff,no-nonsense,old school investigative reporter Cal McCaffrey(gruff,tough,charismatic and competent Russell Crowe,as good as ever),who was a college roommate and longtime friend of the senator's,who immediately uses his knowledge of the system,not only to counsel the senator in how to handle the story(which threatens to unhinge,among other things,his pet project of a congressional investigation of a sort of Blackwater-type mercenary,security-for-hire business)but also to investigate the death,officially ruled as a suicide.What Cal and a perky,more-game-than-she-thought newspaper blogger named Della Frye(Rachel McAdams,also very much looking the part,quite beautifully,I must say),uncover as they dig into the story unfolds a peeling onion of connections and a trail of bodies that threatens anyone and everyone that's connecting with the senator,including Cal himself(no surprise there,of course).Director Kevin McDonald,following up his very intense and intelligent Last King of Scotland,is able to(with the help of writers such as Billy Ray)to boil down what was a popular BBC miniseries into a taut,adventurous and MOSTLY well-plotted two-plus hour film. A supporting cast that is as look-appropriate as they are well-prepped features,among others,Helen Mirren as Cal's stern,bottom-line editor,Robin Wright Penn as Collins' burdened wife and Jason batemean,in what is a somewhat beefed-up cameo as a very oily PR man with more than a little connection to the whos and whats of the case. I have yet to see the BBC miniseries,but if the point of the movie is to pique the interest IN the series,then I have to say it did its job. A plot-twist ending threatens to hurt the storyline,premise or believability of the story previously unfolded,but it is so easily inserted at the end that it can fit in JUST well-enough. No major flaws that mar this film,this movie is more for people who like their adventure and intrigue to unfold AWAY from the primary players(i.e. police,shooters,suspects,etc.)and,in this case, more toward those who put the narrative of events in play.",State of Play

""PointCorp"" already holds numerous government contracts, primarily for security work, but is also engaged in an effort to ensure that U.S. Homeland Security is effectively privatised so that the corporation can profit from becoming the sole contractor for all the work involved. The stakes are high as there are literally billions of dollars to be made from the government contracts and so the ruthless people at the top of the corporation are prepared to do whatever's necessary to ensure that they'll get what they want.""Washington Globe"" investigative reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) takes an interest in a night-time double-shooting incident during which a drug-addicted bag thief was killed and a pizza delivery man was incapacitated and then, next morning hears about a young woman who'd reportedly committed suicide by jumping under a subway train. It soon comes to light that the woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a researcher who was working for Cal's ex-college roommate, Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck). Collins is one of his party's rising stars and the chairman of a committee that's currently looking into the activities of PointCorp. When Collins receives the news about Sonia during a hearing that's being broadcast on TV, he tearfully informs everyone present and later, when he meets up with Cal, admits that Sonia was his lover and says that he's absolutely convinced that she didn't kill herself.When it emerges that Sonia disappeared under a train in one of the subway's CCTV blind spots, the bag thief was carrying a briefcase he'd stolen from PointCorp and the pizza delivery man is shot dead in his hospital bed, Cal becomes convinced of a link between all three killings and the existence of a major conspiracy. Cal's editor, Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren), teams him up with Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a young inexperienced Capitol Hill blogger who writes for the Globe's online version and a major breakthrough follows when she recognises a man who features in one of the photos which was found in the briefcase that was stolen by the bag thief. This then enables Della and Cal to get the information they need to unravel the mystery surrounding Sonia's death and the whole PointCorp conspiracy that, after some further twists and turns, enables them to go to press with their major story.Despite the rather involved nature of this movie's plot and the impressive speed with which the action's delivered, it never loses its clarity and always takes sufficient time to provide all the information that's necessary to make its characters seem totally credible. As a veteran journalist, Cal believes in avoiding sensationalism and checking out his stories thoroughly to ensure that they're accurate. However, his high standards are no longer appreciated in the fast-moving digital world where speed is valued far more highly than accuracy or good taste. By contrast, Della's far more in tune with the current news environment as her gossipy stories and opinion columns take far less time to produce and have the advantage of also attracting a large readership.As the struggling ""Washington Globe"" has new owners (MediaCorp) who are only interested in profits, they've put great pressure on its editor to improve the bottom line or else see the paper closed down and consequently, this pressure makes Cameron Lynne become increasingly demanding, bad tempered and snappy with her staff.The differences between Cal, Della and Cameron add interest to their working relationships and the fact that Cal's friendly with Collins and had previously had an affair with his wife Ann (Robin Wright), makes his struggle for objectivity even more difficult than it would normally be. The quality of the acting in this movie is consistently top-class with superb performances by all its main players and Robin Wright and Jason Bateman (as the PR agent who turns informant) both excellent in their important supporting roles.",State of Play

It has a stellar cast, Russel Crow, Helen Mirren, Ben Affleck, Harry Lennix, Rachel Mcadams, who provide riveting performances in this thriller.

86,inspectors71,A Breath of Fresh Newsprint,7,17 December 2015,"Every time I figured Kevin Macdonald's State of Play was going to descend into cliché and corn, somebody on screen did something I didn't expect. The whole premise of the movie, its ""high concept,"" is a cliché, but Macdonald decides he's going to make something more than a dreary veteran-and-cub-reporters-crack-the-big-government-corruption-case movie. Even if the viewer is predisposed to dislike a journalism movie--the way my wife despises courtroom dramas and we both cringe at jailhouse suspensers--he or she is going to find the characters, for the most part, engaging, or, at least, comfortably recognizable. Three things that caught my eye, besides the plot twists that kept me interested: Supporting characters Helen Mirren and Jeff Daniels underplay their roles, although Mirren's character spends a good deal of the movie snapping and fuming at Russell Crowe and Rachel MacAdams, and Daniels is very believable as a Congressional leader who doesn't have all the evil moves you come to expect in movies.The second grace in State of Play is how little Macdonald uses Ben Affleck. He's a critical part of the story, but Affleck also underplays the part of a corrupt, trapped US representative. He has his moments of being dramatic, but there wasn't a bit of scenery getting chewed when he's confronted with his bad behavior. Finally, in a political thriller like this, made by our friends in Hollywood--who never seem to pass up a chance to be hopelessly partisan in their quest for creating a Workerz Paradise--have made it subtly clear that Affleck and Daniels are--Egads!--Democrats. They're slimy and corrupt and phoney as all get out, but they aren't eeevil Republicans!A movie that is founded on a tried-and-true cliché, plot twists that take the viewer by surprise, characters that don't consume the sets the way my Chihuahua wolfs down cat food, and some freaking originality in saying that corrupt politicians can be liberals?

There are some clichés (especially in the dialogs) but the characters fit their roles, none of them acts badly and their parts do not verge on the stereotypes.

88,Philby-3,An American remake that works,8,3 June 2009,"American versions of good British television series are rather hit or miss, but in this case a well made and exciting thriller has been fashioned out of Paul Abbot's engrossing if flawed 2003 BBC TV miniseries. The film is a lot tighter than the TV series and the bad guys better defined. The core of the story is still the relationship between investigative journalist Cal McCaffrey (a suitably crumpled Russell Crowe) and his former roommate Stephen Collins (a suitably twitchy Ben Affleck), a rising congressman. Six years on, however, another theme has come to the fore as well, the decline of the great newspapers and the principled journalism they practice. As the rivers of gold in classified advertising dry up, good journalism has become too expensive and considered writing is under threat from the outpourings of bloggers and other opinion-peddlers. There were tears to my eyes at the end when the mighty presses of the Washington Globe roar and the rows of freshly printed papers dance along conveyor belts to the ceiling. The internet is hardly an adequate replacement though it does do away with cutting down trees.I won't give the plot away (corporate conspiracies are usually pretty unbelievable and this one is no exception) but I enjoyed all the main performances. Russ was maybe just a little too crumpled and Helen Mirren as the supportive but demanding editor was less amusing than Bill Nighy in the TV series, but Ben Affleck put in a fine performance as a very uptight politician with a lot to hide. Robin Wright Penn struck just the right note as Collins's wife and Rachel McAdams was very convincing as eager beaver cub reporter/blogger Della Frye. Michael Bernesse as the hit-man didn't quite radiate the menace of say Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"", but he came close. Washington itself also gets plenty of screen time, just as the TV series featured London locales.Despite the decline of print newspapers I have noticed that people still write books and other people still buy them, and government inquiries still happen. I suspect that as long as things happen, someone will be there to record them, and maybe give us some analysis as well. The decline of traditional print journalism may be something to regret but something else will fill the vacuum. I hope so anyway. News has a habit of getting around.",State of Play
89,blott2319-1,Solid thriller with a bit of a strange ending,8,30 October 2021,"I cannot describe how much I enjoy a good investigative reporting story, and State of Play really scratched that itch. It also combines that kind of story-telling with the idea of a few people trying to blow the lid on a massive conspiracy that may put their lives in danger, which is another style of film that I love. I was thrilled through most of State of Play, and didn't even care that there were some predictable aspects to the story, because it's not always about finding out whodunnit but seeing how they will be caught. Russell Crowe delivered his same performance he always gives, but it didn't bother me too much here since I was deeply invested in the plot (although I did find myself wondering how much more I'd enjoy it with a better actor.) The rest of the cast did marvelous work, and helped make the entire film more impactful. I even found Ben Affleck to be a good casting choice (for once) because he has the right kind of smarminess that I'd expect from that kind of politician.For a long time I was convinced that State of Play was going to be one of those legendary films that ticks all the boxes for me, and would become a favorite I'd watch again and again. However, there were a couple of things that held it back from greatness for me, and left me just a little disappointed at the end. First of all, there was a slight interpersonal relationship dynamic between some of the characters that felt unnecessary and detracted from the story for me in a small way. It wasn't terrible, but it came across as pointless baggage they were adding to the characters that didn't enhance the plot in any way. Finally, there's the ending. While I can't dig into any details without touching on spoilers, I'll just say that it did too much to reframe the entire plot of the film, and created more questions than answers. It genuinely took me to a place where I no longer knew how to feel about the resolution of State of Play. I didn't need that twist, and it left me conflicted about a movie I was loving up to that point.",State of Play

The fact that it is a political thriller makes it even more appealing. I knew nothing about it being based on a previous 6 part series of some sort. I went into it as a movie holding up its own. It did. These type of movies move along at a decent pace, allow the viewer to join in and provide a story-telling while unraveling the adventure and the mystery at the same time. This is entertainment. There are minor flaws but if one steps back to appreciate a couple of hours of watching they will love to....",State of Play
91,classicalsteve,A Refreshing Blend of Suspense and Character Instead of the Usual 900 Car Chases,9,7 September 2009,"Hollywood used to make more movies like this a few decades ago such as ""All the President's Men"", ""Klute"", ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"", ""The Bourne Identity"" (the 1980's TV-Movie), ""The Firm"" and ""Sneakers"" where the character and the suspense were fused, rather than just stringing a bunch of action sequences together with a few minutes of storyline in between. ""State of Play"" actually has a little bit of the look of a rough-and-tumble political suspense-drama a la ""All the President's Men"". Russell Crowe is well-cast as Cal McCaffrey, a veteran reporter who's written so much about political corruption that whiskey after hours is his way of dealing with it. (Brad Pitt was apparently the original choice but lucky for the film he dropped out during pre-production.) Della Frye (played by Rachel McAdams) is the young upstart internet-savvy newbie reporter who is from the new generation of professionals that read more blogs than newspapers. The two become reluctant bedfellows (not unlike Woodward and Bernstein) when they end up on the same story involving the death of an intern in the employ of a popular politician (Ben Affleck also well-cast as a clean-cut member of the House of Representatives).When Crowe and McAdams first collide, I feared it would play into the cliché of the bubbling green reporter paired with the gloomy pessimistic veteran. Luckily, the film moves quickly past that and finds a way for the characters to become partners with the story. The main thrust concerns the deaths of three people: a young nobody who lives on the street, a pizza delivery guy, and a young intern with whom the politician appears to have had a ""relationship"". The first two were found in an alley, while the other was run over by a subway. Crowe is investigating the deaths of the two guys when he gets an unexpected lead that all three murders may be interrelated. Looming in the backdrop is PointCorp, an overseas US-contracted corporation loosely modeled after Halliburton, the entity awarded the contracts to provide non-military utility and energy operations in post-war Iraq. And it just so happens that Ben Affleck is on the oversight committee who critiques their operations. At the beginning of the film, we learn that Affleck is critical of PointCorp's handling of their overseas contracts. This film had to have been inspired by the so-called ""Black Water"" scandal of the first decade of the 21st century.The point-of-view of the film is entirely from the reporters vantage point which owes a small debt to ""All the President's Men"", which was always from the view of Woodward and Bernstein. By exclusively seeing through the reporters' eyes, we as the audience learn the details and clues as they do, which I think is the strongest way to tell this kind of a political suspense story. ""The International"", a suspense-thriller which is somewhat like this film, lost its way a little when they revealed the baddies mid-way instead of keeping them under wraps until the end. Similar offerings that reveal the how and why of the baddies too quickly instead of waiting until the end diminishes the suspense. In ""State of Play"" there is never a dull moment as the first tentative leads help uncover the trail which ends up at very interesting and unpredictable conclusion.A very good thought-provoking film. The suspense is well-balanced by a little bit of action. My only reservation was Helen Mirren's character as the newspaper editor whose portrayal rings of a Rupert Murdoch, worried about stockholder profits, rather than a Katherine Graham, who was mainly concerned with high-quality news. But then again, maybe in today's news climate where profits trump quality, it sadly may be very realistic.",State of Play
92,hall895,A political thriller which lacks thrills,5,12 January 2015,"State of Play is a film which weaves a tangled web and then struggles mightily, and ultimately unsuccessfully, to untangle it. It's a political thriller in which an intrepid newspaper reporter, with the assistance of a cute blogger, tries to get to the heart of some nefarious conspiracy. But the reporter gets bogged down and the movie does too. The plot is quite convoluted which leads to both boredom and glaring plot holes. It's a story with twists, meant to keep you guessing. But by the end you may no longer be interested enough to be bothered to hazard a guess at what's really going on here.The story deals with PointCorp, a shadowy private defense contractor which is being investigated by Congress. It's Congressman Stephen Collins who is leading the investigation. We meet him just as he is delivered some crushing news: the woman who was his lead researcher has just been killed by a Washington Metro train. Looks like suicide but Collins doesn't believe it. He would certainly have some personal insight into the woman's frame of mind seeing as he was having an affair with her. Once that information becomes public Collins is enveloped in quite the scandal. This of course is not at all bad news for PointCorp. To try to get to the bottom of this Collins turns to old friend Cal McAffrey, investigative newspaper reporter. Cal is on the case but, much to his chagrin, he finds himself teamed up with perky young Della Frye, blogger from the newspaper's online operation. Suffice to say Cal doesn't have much respect for cutie-pie bloggers. Anyhow this odd couple works the story and the film begins to take numerous twists and turns as it moves to what is ultimately a rather disappointing end.A quite unkempt Russell Crowe plays Cal and Crowe provides a solid foundation for the film to build on. With the likes of Helen Mirren, Robin Wright and Jeff Daniels on board this was always going to be a well-acted movie. Rachel McAdams also does fine work in the role of young, naive Della. Ben Affleck, playing Collins, doesn't make for the most convincing congressman but he's not so bad that it really hurts the film. What does hurt the film is that the story just never works properly. It's all about a big conspiracy but there's never enough of a hook to make you really care about that conspiracy. And the film keeps piling on more and more information, so many different strands of the plot which need to tie together. It's all a bit too much. This is a story which desperately needs a big payoff but the ending is not nearly as smart as the filmmakers apparently thought it was. In a film which needs to be filled with suspense there really is very little of it. Honestly the subplot about the pressure on the reporters and their editor, what with the dying newspaper industry and all, seems more compelling than the big conspiracy that the film is actually about. There's a hint of an interesting story in this film but that story gets buried under the weight of the unwieldy plot. Some good performances, especially from Crowe who creates a very interesting character, but the performances are not enough to salvage the film.",State of Play

Of course, how this is supposed to happen when defense budgets are getting slashed to the bone under liberal governance is a mystery. If you want a real nightmare scenario, someone should make a flick about how the kudzu-like tentacles of the federal bureaucracy in the form of the IRS, the EPA, the FDA, the FTC, the Education Department, HHS, HUD and the whole alphabet soup of unelected bureaucrats is insinuating itself into every aspect of our lives.

In the film after a couple of mysterious deaths including congressman Stephen Collins' mistress a reporter named Cal McAffrey and a newer reporter named Della Frye, team up on the case together to unravel the mystery and try to clear things up. However as they go deeper and deeper into the case and uncover more information there seems to be more involved in these cases then they had expected and it looks like they may be unraveling a conspiracy and with ties to more people than the ones just murdered. State Of Play is a well paced thriller with strong writing and good performances from everybody involved as well. The characters are well written and we get to know more about them including things that may not be so flattering about them as the film goes along and they are all very interesting and well written and constructed. The story to the film itself, does require you to pay quite a bit of attention and maybe even some repeat viewings to fully piece together everything that happens during the course of the film. I did feel however that at the end of the film everything was played out to my satisfaction and I really admired the screenwriters for putting together such a fascinating and complex story that is quite a good mystery and just watching the pieces coming apart as it goes along was very interesting to me and made for quite a compelling watch. The direction at times can be fast paced and other times slower to fully show everything in view and get the points of many of the different characters and what is going on. I appreciated this approach and felt it helped the film move along. Even in some of the slower paced scenes, the film is never boring and it just offers us more to think about and to digest and you the viewer may be trying to put this puzzle together yourself. As, I already mentioned all the performances, including the supporting ones are all very strong and bring a lot of life and character to the characters that they are portraying and make the film riveting with the skilled direction and complex yet fascinating screenplay. If you are a fan of films like these I think you will find that this one will capture your interest quickly and take you on quite a thrilling ride till the film's ending and those mystery buffs should find a lot to like here as well. Overall a maturely handled and effective thriller that works because of a good script, performances and direction. If this is the type of film you would normally find interesting, then I highly recommend it and even if you don't usually see films of this type, there may be something for you here as well.",State of Play

""State of Play"" is a very solid choice for a demographic like this. It's quite conventional, but plays out well. All of the major actors pretty much act like they do in all of their other major motion pictures--nobody pushing any bounds, which actually usually works out best. The plot's got enough twists going that it keeps you guessing until the end, although when it's all revealed you aren't shocked. That's because with this kind of movie, you know it's going to be tied up in a nice and neat bow, you're just waiting to see how it's going to be done. Like I said it's quite conventional. It's also very slick, it's production values are top-notch, and it's story pacing is pretty much spot-on. For a diverse multi-aged audience of men and women, this film was considered solid entertainment by all, although nobody would claim that it's breaking any original trails.

Gary Condit action figure not included.,6,12 October 2009,"State of Play: 6 out of 10: State of Play is two hour plus big budget thriller without one memorable scene and only one memorable performance. The memorable performance is Helen Mirren who brightens up the screen whenever she appears. The rest of the performances are more stereotypes than individual characters.Russell Crowe plays a reporter for a Washington Post stand-in. He looks and act like the stereotypical beat reporter. His best friend is Congressman Ben Affleck who is your standard movie congressional representative (Noble but battling demons.) He is caught in an affair with a now dead staffer and his best friend is on the case. Tagging along with Crowe is neophyte cub reporter Rachel McAdams who Jimmy Olsens it up despite the fact she is a lead blogger at a major national newspaper. Robin Wright Penn plays Affleck’s cuckolded wife and seems to be in a different movie than the rest of the cast.Mirren is the newspapers publisher and gets the films best lines, which she dishes, with aplomb. Everyone else seems to be playing along at half speed. For a thriller there is a strange lack of action or tension. The twists seemed preordained and the characters behave exactly as they are programmed.The film certainly has star power and a big budget but it simply does not seem to know what to do with it. Part of the problem is that it is condensed from a 2003 British mini-series of the same name. Condensing the 300 minutes of plot into 120 or so minutes leaves little room for character development or nuance. The players seem to be quickly checking of plot boxes.The films other big problem is that it is a overwrought love letter to the newspaper business, including groan worthy dialogue about the magnanimous printed fourth estate and an end title sequence that can only be described as porn for publishers.Somewhat entertaining and yet eminently forgettable State of Play is worth a look.

He is thrown together with a young journalist Della played by Rachel Adams. For me the (working) relationship between the two of them never really works and is the weakest part of the film. It almost feels as if the producers will not green light the film unless it's got a pretty young female playing a rather irrelevant character. the film is based on a TV programme and it would be interesting to compare and contrast who played that role in the original.Anyway that gripe aside, it's a couple of entertaining hours and whilst it may not be anything new, it's certainly enjoyable.",State of Play
100,ajs-10,Well written with some great performances.,8,9 May 2010,"This film is based on the BBC TV mini-series ""State of Play"" (2003) written by Paul Abbott. Of course the setting has been moved to the bright lights of Washington DC and certain elements of the story have been changed to suit, but the basis of the original is still there.When a drug addict is shot down in the street and another man badly injured, Washington Globe reporter Cal McAffrey is assigned the story. The next morning, political researcher Sonia Baker is killed when someone pushes her in front of a train on the subway. Young online reporter, Della Frye is assigned that story. Little do they know at this stage, but both incidents are linked. Congressman Stephen Collins is heading up a hearing looking into the activities of a private military contractor called Point Corp. The researcher, Sonia Baker, worked for the congressman and, what's more, was having an affair with him. It also happens that Stephen Collins is friends with Cal McAffrey; they were room mates at college. This being the case, Collins turns to his friend for help when the press hound him after the story of the affair comes out. McAffrey begins to look into Sonia's death and finds that there is a link between that and the story he was originally working on. A female drug addict makes contact with Cal and sells him some photos that had been stolen from a briefcase. Her friend, the addict who was shot, had taken them from a briefcase he stole from a businessman who turned out to be a hit man. The photos are of Sonia, showing her going about her business, which isn't all it appears to be. This all links back to Point Corp. Cal's editor, Cameron Lynne wants to publish, but Cal wants to dig deeper and expose the full story. It's a very complicated plot, and I will not take you through all the twists and turns here, but I think there's enough to whet your appetite for now.It's a very well made film with plenty to get your teeth into. As I've already mentioned, there are plenty of plot twists to keep you on your toes. Some really good performances too, in particular, Russell Crowe as Cal McAffrey, Ben Affleck as Rep. Stephen Collins and Helen Mirren as Cameron Lynne. Honourable mentions also go to Rachel McAdams as Della Frye, Robin Wright as Anne Collins (Stephen's wife), Jason Bateman as Dominic Foy, Jeff Daniels as Rep. George Fergus and Michael Berresse as Robert Bingham.I really enjoyed this film; it's one you have to watch though, with all those plot twists, if you get distracted you could quite easily miss something. It's a really well written plot with some good dialogue and some real edge-of-your-seat thrills along the way. On top of all that there are some really fine performances, Ben Affleck went up in my estimation with this one, Russell Crowe was great (as ever) and Helen Mirren was as brilliant as always. Over all, pretty highly recommended.My score: 7.6/10",State of Play
101,charlytully,The Gary Condit connection to STATE OF PLAY,8,23 April 2009,"First of all, I studied all of the information and comments on IMDb about the original, 2003 British TV series on which the 2009 Russell Crowe movie is based, plus the message boards for said movie, and learned that the best guess anyone has for the title's meaning is ""at this point in time,"" which would be lame for a political thriller's tag-line, which makes ""state of play"" even lamer! Secondly, this flick's final plot twist is not really clever, but rather the sort of thing the U.S. TV show ""24"" does all the time to pad out a 24-episode season. This 127-minute movie cannot cite the same excuse for its haphazard, wishy-washy plotting. Thirdly, staffer Chandra Levy disappeared from U.S. Congressman's Gary Condit's office in May, 2001 (prior to the TV S.O.P), and California voters soon learned that Condit hailed from a veritable crime family (see his Wikipedia biography for the details; Condit has sued everyone under the sun, so I will say no more here). The opening plot points of both versions of S.O.P. bare strong resemblance to many aspects of the Condit case (the main difference being that, in real life, the staffer was missing for months, whereas in both S.O.P.'s her death occurs in public, so her body's found immediately). Interestingly, Levy's murder was not officially ""solved"" until March, 2009--long after both S.O.P.'s had finished filming. Finally, I gave the movie an ""8"" instead of a ""3"" for its excellent homage to America's dying print newspaper business (the death of which will allow future Watergate-style chicanery to go unpunished).",State of Play
102,RonellSowes,Rapid But Slow,5,21 June 2021,"State of Play is something like an All the President's Men with aspects of a higher intensity spy flick thrown in to bring some added energy. And perhaps that was a succesful formula because the picture does have a good pace and moves along quickly, but it still somehow quite dull. It's not like it takes too long to get going, in fact it takes off right off the bat and dives into the story without distractions. And neither does it just stagnate, it keeps the revelations constant and is always piling on more to the plot. But what it adds doesn't seem to increase the height of tension in the movie it only seems to direct it into one foreseeable conclusion.State of Play certainly has the cast of an A grade film(who,specifically Crowe, play a significant amount in any of its success) and doesn't possesses many of the trademarks of a bad movie.

104,jdkraus,Overall well done,7,3 June 2009,"I always liked a good mystery thriller. ""State of Play"" is not a bad one. The plot held my interest (though it kind of dragged), the movie has an intense finale, and a decent cast. I'll admit that Russell Crowe and Helen Mirren stole the show a bit, both being excellent thespians. I particularly liked Crowe, not necessarily because he's a favorite actor of mine, but due to his ability in getting absorbed into a character. There aren't many spectacular actors under the age of fifty, but Crowe once again proves himself to be one of them. Rachel McAdams, who I haven't seen in many movies, also adds diligence to her character, as does a surprising appearance of Jeff Daniels. The weakest link though was Ben Affleck. I will say that I am not a fan of his, but in my opinion, he just doesn't convey emotion in a role very well. He either goes over the top or under. In this film more over than under. He's not an actor who just reads a script and does what he is told like some other actors today, but to me he's just, not that great. I honestly think that the real brilliance in the film comes from the work of Kevin MacDonald's direction. He probably won't see an Oscar for a long time, but I absolutely love his use of tracking shots and sense of balance, both symmetrical and asymmetrical in the film. Rodrigo Prieto, who I regard as among the best cinematographers of the twenty-first century, adds a brilliant sense of depth of field/rack focus to the film, as well as capturing both grimly lit scenes of alleyways and brightly lit ones of the news reporters' office to heighten and darken the mood. Tony Gilroy's script also adds a touch of wonder to the film. This is a good film that has some decent acting (except on Affleck's part), as well as being well shot, written, and photographed. I will also point out that even though the body count in the film is low, the violence is shocking graphic for a PG-13. I'm not squeamish, but for those who are, this may not be for you.

105,bopdog,"Grand and exhilarating! Brilliant acting, including Ben Affleck's big ""comeback"" role.",10,18 April 2009,"Thrillers have required paces and plots--- this one is not different in that respect. It does, however, unfold its plot effortlessly, seamlessly, and beautifully. I was excited, and held in complete suspense throughout. This is a masterpiece within its genre, and a bit outside its genre as well.First, let me congratulate Ben Affleck for finally returning to the promise he showed early in his career, before he was sidetracked by all that red-carpet ""paparazzi-chasing"" garbage. His acting in the film was truly stellar. Solid, mature, excellent work! Russell Crow was also a continuing wonder. Years ago, in his Gladiator days, he was a bit obnoxious, one might feel. But ever since, we have seen a man of great depth and substance revealing himself AND the essence of many characters for our edification, not to mention, of course, our entertainment. I must say I am again amazed. Crowe gets better and better with each film he makes. His performance here is a sheer joy to behold! Helen Mirren was eerily grand as the newspaper editor. Neither hero nor villain, and never grand-standing or chewing the scenery, her acting was a deft balance of humanity and professionalism and the toughness that profession demands.And, this may be the first major film to deal with the subject of the actual, real-life collapse of what we once knew as newspapers. I am an academic in the field, and have studied the matter, and have heard from the world's top media people. For better or worse, newspapers are dead. Let's just hope and pray that the crusading journalism portrayed in this film is not dead, but merely preparing to move house (to the web or where ever).I'll skip details or descriptions of the plot. I think the reader will know about all there is to know by now. Let me say, though, that is was masterfully and beautifully accomplished. It deals with some of the lowest behaviours modern humanity is capable of, but at no time did the movie dip into the tawdry.

106,DonFishies,A solid and interesting old-fashioned political thriller,8,15 April 2009,"Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is helping with the government investigation of a shady military-based company when he receives word that his mistress has committed suicide. Visually distraught, he leaves a hearing in tears and sets off a media circus. Seasoned reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) was his roommate in college, and the two have remained friends. In a bid to quash the political blogging of junior reporter Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), McAffrey sets out to find the truth about the story.State of Play sets itself up early on to be a cookie-cutter, predictable thriller. But as the film progresses, it rather quickly becomes the twisty and conniving thriller it needs to be. Despite being heavily dialogue driven, the film is an intense ride that will keep people on edge throughout. Some scenes are downright terrifying in their amped up suspense and political intrigue. This film really set out to be tense, and succeeds wonderfully. It knows just what punches to pull, and when to pull them.The script, written by political scribes Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilory and Billy Ray, is insight and intriguing. It could have easily been made boring and inundated with rehashed politicalisms (like all of their last films), but this film revels in how interesting it becomes. It has laughs strung throughout (a genuine surprise), and lacks the nerve to become loaded to the brim with facts and innuendos. Instead, it expertly weaves between scenes, amping up the intensity of some scenes, and downplaying others.But this is mainly due to the incredible performances by the cast. Crowe (who I usually loathe) and Affleck are simply outstanding in their roles. Age issues aside, both play their character with finesse and charisma. Affleck looks and acts like a confused wet-behind-the-ears, gunning-for-higher-office political pawn from beginning to end. Some of the reactions on his face are downright devastating in how excellently they are conveyed. And this is a guy critics once said could not act. Coupled with one-two shot of acting in Hollywoodland and directing Gone Baby Gone, we may be seeing a renewed resonance and importance for the Oscar-winner. Crowe on the other hand, delivers his strongest performance in years. While he has been downplayed and underused in his last few films, he carries this film. He is stubborn and vaguely likable, but he makes his character work for all of his idiosyncrasies and ethically-questionable tactics. He makes a seasoned journalist look like an amateur.McAdams, all but a ghost recently, holds her own against the two heavy-hitters and delivers a performance that is both inspired and emotional. It gives her a lot of room to act, and she delivers in every instance. The rest of the cast is a bit mixed however, as so little of them is given that much to do. Harry Lennix, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, the horrifying Michael Berresse and especially Jason Bateman, all deliver noteworthy performances, but never get to really shine in them. They all have their traits and motivations, but get little screen time to truly express them. They each are developed quite strongly, but they lack the movement afforded to Crowe, Affleck and McAdams. I simply loved Helen Mirren's scenery-gauging editor and all of her subtleties. But she too, is downplayed to the point of almost barely being in the film.Despite its intensity, the film is bogged down by its dialogue-heavy scenes and consistent character additions. It is easy to keep track of everyone, but so many people are introduced that the film loses its focus on more than one occasion. It makes for a few scenes that are merely filler between the scenes of useful heavy acting. It just feels so tiring. I understand now how daunting a task it must have been to convert six hours of British television into a 127-minute film, but there are scenes that are just too easy to not have been cut out (some entire mildly useful subplots may have helped). Adding characters in makes sense for a story about two journalists frantically searching to lift the lid on a story, but there needs to be more emphasis on what was needed and not needed. A brilliant montage in the middle of the film goes almost entirely to waste because the filmmakers lack the knowledge of what should be cut. Limiting the preposterous and silly climax could have also done wonders. The scenes that are left in the film (including the finale) are great, but they could have been stronger if they were as tightly wound as the film wants itself to be. A little less shaky hand camera movement could have also significantly benefited the film.Even with its problems, it is clear from the on-set of the first shot in the bullpen at the Washington Globe that the filmmakers are going for a very keen sense of homage to All the President's Men. While the on-going and very professional relationship between McAffrey and Frye is very similar to Woodward and Bernstein, the fabric of journalistic integrity and researching are the core of State of Play. The film is loaded with allusions to the Oscar-winning film, and even mimics shots right out of the film. While it is obvious for anyone who has seen Men, this film's nods are done in such a delicate and unique way that they never become distracting or blatant. The film is its own, and does not ever feel like it is living in its big-brother's shadow. It is a fresh take on old-fashioned reporting in a very digital age, and frequently walks the tight line of old versus new.State of Play looked interesting, and surprisingly delivers on almost every count. It is not a perfect film, but it is a solid example of great film-making. It wants to be more, but seems content at being a twisty and suspenseful modern thriller. 8/10.",State of Play

After all how many movies based on TV projects are actually as good as the original? In this case my skepticism was misplaced. While it may have been cut down to two hours or so and Americianized this version of State Of Play is every bit as good as the BBC version.Both have a strong cast in common. I was initially skeptical of the idea of Russel Crowe playing the role of reporter Cal McAffrey )played so well by John Simm in the original) yet I found that Crowe gives a fine performance in the role and really makes it his own, especially in his scenes with Ben Affleck. Affleck, while perhaps too young to be believable as a Congressman, gives a well-balanced and believable performance as Stephen Collins and shares some good chemistry with Crowe in particular. Rachel McAdams proves to be a perfect choice to play the young and inexperienced Della Frye and proves a worthy match for her costar Crowe. Add on performances from Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, Harry Lennix, Jason Bateman and Michael Berresse (in a menacing performance that must be seen) the result is as fine a cast as the BBC version. The only odd piece of casting was Helen Mirren which is down not to her performance (which is as good as she has given in recent memory) but down to the fact that it seems weird to have a British editor on an American newspaper but doesn't really diminish form her performance.The production values of the film are strong. With the moving of location from the UK to here in the States the film moves the focus to Washington D.C. which the film makes strong use of. The cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto makes the Washington of this film seem a dark and threatening place where the truth is also in shadow rather then in light. Also of special mention is the score by Alex Heffes which not only gives the film much of its tension but underpins the emotions of the characters as well (which is what any good film score should do after all).The script of the film is as much a highlight of this version as the BBC version. While the BBC version of the story focused on Collins and his committee investigating the energy industry, the film version shows Collins and his committee focusing on the Blackwater like mercenary company PointCorp. In one of the best moments of the film a source for McAffrey goes down a list of PointCiorp's ""acomplishments"" which are in fact the ""accomplisments"" of Blackwater. It's a rare move in a Hollywood film for it to actually inform its audience of something of actual merit but State Of Play does exactly that by revealing the dark nature of defense contracts. The script by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray (from the original Paul Abbott script of course) uses mainly words and only a couple of action sequences to bring the audience in and hold them there for the films length. True some subplots and characters (escpecially the one played by James McAvoy in the BBC version) are excised but this is done out of the necessity of bringing the film down to a two hour or so length and actually doesn't harm the film. If you want a fine example of a Hollywood thriller look no further. Taking the original BBC version as a base, the filmmakers have created a version of State Of Play that stands on its own and is just as good as the original with its combination of cast, strong production values nd first rate script. Plus with its informative storyline, State Of Play is also a topical political thriller. In short State Of Play is a must-see thriller that stands up well against not only many of the thrillers of late but the original version as well.",State of Play
109,moviesleuth2,"A breath of fresh air for the ""thriller"" genre",8,26 July 2009,"A story's plot doesn't have to be original, but if the director's approach is formulaic, a good story can be rendered more or less inert. Fortunately, Kevin Macdonald, the Scottish director who wowed critics with his breathtaking documentary ""Touching the Void"" and directed Forest Whitaker to an Oscar for ""The Last King of Scotland,"" has made it clear that he wants nothing to do with conventional approaches to film-making. MacDonald seems to thrive on taking risks, and his unique vision of the material (based on a British miniseries) elevates this film from good to near-brilliant.One night, two men are murdered in Washington D.C. The next morning, a woman is pushed in front of a subway train. Two journalists, Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) and Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), are assigned to cover the stories. But they quickly begin to discover that not only are these murders connected, they cover-up a shadowy conspiracy that involves a congressman (Ben Afleck), who also happens to be Cal's old roommate from college, and long-time friend.There are some movies that are all about characters and great acting. This isn't one of them. There's simply too much going on for there to be any room for more than minimal character development. As it is, the actors acquit themselves well enough. In general, I'm not a fan of Russell Crowe, but I won't hesitate to admit that he's a good actor (his performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"" was jaw-dropping, far better than his Oscar-winning turn in the HUGELY over-rated ""Gladiator""). Crowe is an unusual choice for Cal, but he does a good job. Rachel McAdams is adorable, but she's a little flat. I've never liked Ben Afleck (I hate actors who get too much attention from the media), but he's effective here (I'm guessing his casting was not because he could play the part the best, but because of box-office considerations. As if this film didn't have enough wattage already). Helen Mirren is keeping her name out there after her Oscar win for ""The Queen,"" and even though she doesn't have much to do, she's still good. Jason Bateman is effective in a rare dramatic performance, and Robin Wright Penn is wasted as Alfeck's wife (for such a small part, you'd think that the producers would have allowed Polly Walker to carry over her part from the original mini-series and get her name to American audiences...and it's not as if she's an unknown! She was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in the HBO series ""Rome."") However, the real star of the film is director Kevin Macdonald. Macdonald doesn't allow anyone to dominate the film. While Cal is clearly the central character, the film is not Crowe's film. By not allowing anyone to take center stage, ""State of Play"" becomes story-oriented, and that's good, because the story is strong, and very complicated. It's actually surprising that nothing is very confusing and there are no unanswered questions. But Macdonald goes even further. His telling of the story uses a ""you are there"" approach, and the excitement and sense of something big happening that the characters feel is also felt by the audience.What's more, ""State of Play"" touches upon a lot of relevant issues. Journalists feel a lot of pressures: impending deadlines, which stories are going to be more read, and how to make a newspaper profitable. It also addresses how the field of journalism is changing. With the universal usage of the internet, blogging and online newspapers are competing with paper news, and this conflict is represented by the rivalry between Cal, the ""traditional"" reporter, and Della, the new blogger.Although in general I frown upon remakes, at least this one isn't a hackneyed piece of crap that the major studios usually make with remakes. ""State of Play"" is a terrific thriller.",State of Play
110,joachimokeefe,Forget Nytol - watch State of Catatonia instead,1,6 February 2013,"Russell Crowe plays a maverick investigative journalist. He's so cool! He has a disastrously messy work cubicle, he has long hair, he mumbles, he's Oirish, he's a male chauvinist pig, he cooks for himself, and presumably the only reason he's not the editor-in-chief is because he's a bit of a slacker. And that, friends, is the only flaw in his character. He's a bit of a slacker. So in the story, he (Cal) comes across as this perfect (if slobbish) human being who we know is going to get to the bottom of the murder/conspiracy mystery in the way we know the killer in each 'Columbo' episode before Columbo appears. No doubt at any point that he will. So no suspense. There is NO SUSPENSE in this suspense thriller about corporate conspiracy. But hey, at least you can watch it if you have insomnia.",State of Play

Great film great acting great ending, I'm happy.",State of Play
112,WriterDave,Yesterday's News Still Blog-Worthy,7,20 April 2009,"A gruff old-school reporter (Russell Crowe playing his A-game) becomes personally entangled in a breaking news story surrounding his old college buddy turned congressman (Ben Affleck, not as bad as you would think) and a young female aid who died under mysterious circumstances in the surprisingly plausible political thriller ""State of Play"" from director Kevin MacDonald who was previously responsible for ""The Last King of Scotland"". Though designed as a throw-back to paranoid investigative thrillers from the 1970's, relevance is gained when the massive cover-up revealed becomes a vehicle for the filmmakers to explore the death of print news at the hand of digital mediums.The twisty and engaging screenplay is credited to three scribes: Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray. But it's Gilroy's fingerprints that shape the story with all the overlapping dialogue and conspiracy talk that will remind many of his ""Michael Clayton"". Adapted from a sprawling BBC miniseries created by Paul Abbott, the trio is especially deft in their condensing of the story into a fully digestible two hours. Even as new characters and twists keep coming, the audience is never left out in the cold. They also give the cast plenty to chew on with some great throw-away lines amidst all the posturing between the cops, reporters, politicians and sleaze-bags.Though it's Crowe and Helen Mirren as his sparring and quick-witted boss who shine the most, this is essentially an ensemble piece, and it's especially clever when Jason Bateman arrives on screen for a few pivotal scenes as a smug public relations guru who's too dumb to realize he knows too much. The cast also includes Robin Wright Penn as Affleck's wife, Jeff Daniels as the arrogant majority whip and Harry Lennix, who as a D.C. detective makes a compelling case here for the lead role in the Barack Obama Story. The only miscalculation in the casting is poor Rachel McAdams, lovely but annoying in her high-pitch as Crowe's blogging tag-along looking to kick it old-school and get something in print.By the third act ""State of Play"" overplays its hand in its attempts to be timely with too much talk of the privatization of the military, Capitol Hill sex scandals and traditional newspapers losing out in the digital age to bloggers more concerned with gossip than real journalism. It could've also been more subtle in its preaching about the importance of serious investigative reporting. It should be commended, however, for an otherwise smart screenplay that doesn't spell out all its twists and turns too early and the well polished cast who give the film a slick sheen. Even though it might be reporting on yesterday's news, ""State of Play"" still makes for solid rainy day entertainment and is worthy of blogging about.",State of Play

114,judywalker2,"okay but lacks that certain ""punch""",7,17 April 2009,"State of Play was a reasonably good political thriller. It kind of plods along slowly, picking up speed toward the middle and then kind of dies a little at the end. It lacks that ""punch"" of a great thriller and you kind of saw well okay in the end instead of wow. Russell Crowe is as usual great in his role and Helen Mirren really does a good job. I wished they had used some of the other minor characters more, especially Justin Bateman and Robin Wright who give fabulous performances. It's only when Afleck is on the screen that you really want to cringe. Why doesn't this guy just give up acting? He should direct or run for public office or something, just stay off the movie screen, please.",State of Play

So I thought the acting was decent, the plot was gripping and was matched by the ending. What I will say was that I wasn't shocked when the ""twist"" at the end and all was revealed. The final half an hour eliminates a lot of what you think happened, so it left little to the imagination. It was still done really well though!If you like thrillers and haven't seen this film then I recommend it. Slightly slower plot, but is a very gripping film to watch.",State of Play
116,mukava991,entertaining enough,7,18 June 2009,"The most impressive qualities of this film are the atmospherics and fancy camera-work, a few of the performances and finally the layered and complex nature of the characters. The story, adapted from a highly regarded six-hour British TV miniseries about the investigation of a sinister corporation that trains mercenaries and is plotting to take over America's homeland security operations by stealth, is one of those conspiracy thrillers that keeps you guessing the characters' motivations. Following the plot twists requires concentration and effort and from early on you are rooting for Russell Crowe as the slovenly but principled newspaper reporter trying to get to the bottom of a tangle of murders, one of which involves the mistress of an old college friend (Ben Affleck) who is now a US Congressman.The depiction of a modern newspaper poised between the newsprint and computer age is first rate. The set designers must have had a field day. A similar replication of a busy newspaper's headquarters was also done brilliantly 33 years earlier in All the President's Men. Another parallel to that earlier film: A suspenseful scene takes place in a garage at night. A nod to His Girl Friday is included with the introduction of a female reporter (Rachel McAdams) who struggles with Crowe over coverage of the developing story.Crowe is perfect – not one false moment ever. Ditto McAdams. Affleck has less screen time but is convincing as the congressman. Jason Bateman and Michael Berresse dominate their scenes as a corrupt PR man and a demented ex-soldier, respectively.",State of Play

I believe the guy is about the best around because of the believable tension he brings to the roles in which he plays. Helen Miriam was a bonus; she makes gold in whatever role in which she is cast. Diane and I both commented on the photography in the film and that the shot-selection was particularly appropriate to the on-screen action. This film, because I believe it to be based on a British TV series, means that the script was very tight and very suspenseful. There were no silly gimmicks or violence—just tight drama with the actors playing at their best. I would recommend this movie to any person that loves plot-fuelled drama at its very best.",State of Play
118,TaylorYee94,How come I find this movie 10 years later!!,8,13 May 2021,"Well made thriller film proving how important the script is to the movie. I'm not sure why 'State of Play' did not hit as much as it was supposed to be because of the marketing or whatever reason, but it does not matter. The power of exquisite script is enough to engross audience who joins Cal to investigate the fact behind Sonia Baker's death. So many stakeholders behind the crime, and the writer engages all parts but also makes sure that audience is not confused. It is genius how he or she can keep the story so neat with so many parties involved. Neat and simple plot you guess? No way. Twists at the right moment, exactly when needed. Two big twists in the plot development revive audience's attentions and curiosity.I also love the ending credits. Homage to objective and formal printed newspaper amid increasing short and personal internet blogs and posts. This theme appears often through Car's attitude toward Della at the beginning and Della's growth in journalism during the course. These scenes really reflect what the media industry was like in late 2000s.",State of Play

120,pfgpowell-1,"Good remake, but has the same flaw as original",7,31 July 2010,"This version of State Of Play is a remake of the original British TV version, and as a remake it ain't half bad. But there are two problems. The first and lesser problem is that if you saw the original, you'll know how it all ends and suspense will be rather lacking. When I first heard that Hollywood was going to remake the TV State Of Play, I thought I also heard that it would be rewritten to have a different ending. Well, I got that wrong. The ending, in fact the whole story is the same. The greater problem, compounded by the fact that Hollywood had to cram into two hours what TV had far, far longer to expound, is that here the story doesn't really hang together. In the original there are red herrings galore, but the piece was none the worse for that because in real life any such investigation, whether by the cops or, as here, by hacks, will be full of them. For time reasons, the film has to syncopate much of the original story and that does it no favours. There are loose ends and elements which are insufficiently explained. The original, at least, had the time to outline the lot. Then there is the story itself: reviewing the TV version I think I compared it to being marched up to the top of the hill, and then being marched back down again: for this viewer (of both) versions the story makes rather less sense than it should. We are initially led to believe the a huge scandal is to be uncovered which involves the the might of the military industrial complex as well as those in high office. What we finally get - spoiler coming up - is a man hired to find out about a women going far too far, in fact going as far as murder. Again, fair enough. But could a Congressman, who didn't actually order the murder just surveillance really try for a cover up? No, not really. OK, so he was having an affair and got one of the murder victims pregnant, but being the bright sort he would have realised that in no way could he have been held responsible for the killings. A second major flaw is that of the two stories - Congressman has affair and political leader hires girl to spy on Congressman to help out the major security company the Congressman is investigating, THAT is the story. But that is not how the film plays it: Collins, the Congressman - who has not really done anything amiss - gets the headlines. Having said all that, this version of State Of Play more than holds its own among the slate of political thrillers which come our way every year. That is not least thanks to Russell Crowe, the inspired casting of Helen Mirren as an almost foul-mouthed editor and Ben Affleck. The film's portrayal of newspaper life is not too bad (the Lou Grant TV series of yesteryear was terrible) and I write that as someone who has worked in the newspaper industry for more years than I care to remember. Members of most professions, not least cops, will gripe when their job is tarted up for portrayal on the silver screen, but in this case it wasn't too bad. I don't quite buy the editor (in both the TV and screen versions) taking such a hands on approach to getting the story but then this is a film, not real life. She also wouldn't have held up the presses for four hours while Crowe dotted his i's and crossed his t's but simply relegated it to the second, third or fourth edition. But these are quibbles. If you haven't seen the TV version, go for it.",State of Play
121,steiner-sam,Entertaining political thriller,5,14 June 2021,"It's set in the present (2009) and concerned the interactions of a congressman, two reporters, and a mysterious defense contractor, PointCorp, that appears to be amassing power unto itself.An old grizzled reporter, Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), investigates the accidental death (or was it suicide) of his college friend's mistress. His college friend is Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck), and the mistress, Sonia Baker, is the lead research assistant in his investigation of PointCorp. Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) is the eager young reporter that works with McAffrey. The publisher of the ""Washington Globe"" is a British woman named Cameron (Helen Mirren). Collins' wife, Anne (Robin Wright), was also an old college friend of McAffrey and had had an affair with him while married to Collins.This is basically a guys' movie; the women's roles seem thin and insubstantial. The male actors occupy fairly predictable characterizations--McAffrey's a slob and rule-breaker; Collins is a straight-laced war hero with a polished persona. There is another shady congressman, as well as a killer on the loose who may be working for PointCorp. Or is he?There are at least four bodies by the end, and we learn that the congressman is pulling many more strings than it first appears.

123,Ramascreen,"It's Not ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but 'this is as big and as connected as it gets'",8,19 April 2009,"STATE OF PLAY is gripping, an intense thriller that doesn't have car chase scenes but it has that race against time factor especially when it comes to investigative journalism and deadlines. The twist ending isn't much of a revelation but... a satisfactory resolution nonetheless. The entire time it takes us on a whodunit case through reporter's world and methods. It's not as monumental as All The President's Men but I think more smart movies like STATE OF PLAY should be made.Director Kevin Macdonald who brought us The Last King of Scotland takes his time with STATE OF PLAY. Those who are impatient might find the first half of the movie to be a bit on the boring side. But once you can put the pieces of the puzzle together, the pace picks up and the story starts to slowly but surely unravel itself. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't have outrageous scenes, it aims to be as realistic as possible, but at the same time, the movie lacks humor, too much serious could make your mind go numb..and at times, this almost gets to that point.STATE OF PLAY reminds us that in the midst of internet, blogs, TV's and all other technological channels and portals out there, newspapers are still very vital, influential players in releasing information that shape the people.Just like in The Last King of Scotland, where director Kevin Macdonald prepares each moment to bring us to the big devil embodied by the dictator played by Forest Whitaker... in STATE OF PLAY, Macdonald also builds it brick by brick, leading up to the unmasking of the devil behind the corruption and lies.Speaking of lies, I believe deception is the underlining thread in this story, so thin and yet effective. Right from the start.. it's all about cover-up. We're made to believe that in this movie, the media is the good guys but even they do their own share of lies. STATE OF PLAY gives you different street smart ways that reporter use to dig out the truth. Not interrogation style like police work but in the way they word out their sentence and language when they ask a certain set of questions or the places they'd choose to ambush their potential sources. It's like trapping somebody to say something. Fascinating.Brilliant cast led by the unbelievably fat Russell Crowe. I just had to mention that he has let himself go in this one. But it helps with his character who's so focused in his work so much so that he doesn't have time to even cut his hair, shave, or buy a decent car or workout. I wouldn't say this is Russell Crowe's best work but he gives a convincing performance. The dreamy Rachel McAdams wants to show that she can play in the same caliber level as Crowe and Helen Mirren and she sure can. The young actress is not The Notebok girl anymore, she's got charisma and her supporting role is one that's not easily forgotten. As the reporter that Russel Crowe's character's mentoring, she finally learns what it means and what it takes to get the story, which line that shouldn't be crossed and which rules that can be bent. Doubt follows her as she wonders if it's all worth it.Ben Affleck will always be Ben Affleck, but he's a necessary addition because it's as if the character was practically written with him in mind.STATE OF PLAY is the kind of thriller that makes you think and you'll feel glad once you've passed the test at the end. A study of corruption, immorality, and the ends justify the means. The problem at hand is so connected and dangerous, you don't know who might get hurt next,.. you're gonna wanna sit through this one.--Rama's SCREEN--",State of Play

The third, and best is Jason Bateman's one surprising scene as mean congressman Dominic Foy. These are three great scenes. That said, the movie is way too long and confusing. The movie follows Cal trying to figure out the murder of Sonya Baker, in which Stephem Collins (Ben Affleck) might have been a part of. As we get in deeper on the murder, there is really nothing shocking or original. I felt myself knowing what was going to happen. It might of helped if this was not based on a true story everyone already knows about. It doesn't take its time to conclude anything. They just try to build up suspense, but forget that they can't just be thrilling to do that. The conclusion is more than just obvious, it is stupid and forced.

So, a newspaper pays a journalist to sit in its offices 'blogging' all day - oh please, I've died laughing.

132,tburke85,State Of Play A Decent Thriller With Flaws,7,19 January 2010,"State Of Play is a decent thriller with flaws from director Kevin Macdonald whose admirable in making this movie but a slow pace and a predictable twist near the end weigh it down. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, and Hellen Mirren. Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, and Jason Bateman are also decent in their roles that amount to extended appearances. All three of them are effective as their characters despite only having a few minutes of screen time. Ben Affleck is the only real weak link I found in the cast. He wasn't that bad but I didn't think he was as good as Crowe or McAdams. Affleck still does what the role requires I guess though. The rest of the cast are okay but no one stands out. The film has some character development, drama, a little suspense, and mystery which mostly worked in it's favor. The pacing however was slow at times because for me the movie dragged in certain areas making it feel longer than it really is. The plot twist near the end I sort of saw coming and a better surprise revelation would've done the film more justice I think but State Of Play is still worth watching at least once. So overall if you're a fan of the genre than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. State of Play is a decent political mystery thriller with good performances by the cast including Crowe and McAdams who make it worth the time to watch despite it's flaws.",State of Play

134,gregeichelberger,Mid-level poli-thriller with good cast,6,17 April 2009,"Kevin Macdonald (""Last King of Scotland"") cobbles together a fair press/political thriller out of a variety of better movies such as ""All the President's Men,"" ""The Pelican Brief,"" ""Absence Of Malice"" and ""Conspiracy Theory,"" among others in the new Universal release, ""State of Play."" And while I'm not exactly sure what the title means, Macdonald's effort is workmanlike, if somewhat dull near the middle. A good cast, however, including Oscar winners Russell Crowe (""Gladiator"") and Helen Mirren (""The Queen""), Ben Affleck, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels and Jason Bateman helps anchor the picture and gives it a professional gloss.Plot has the idealistic and ambitious young Congressman, Stephen Collins (Affleck) ready to hold hearings on the efforts of a professional paramilitary private security company's efforts to obtain huge government contracts to operate in the U.S. (see: BlackWater, Inc.). This will somehow lead to a total loss of our freedoms.Before he can rip them a new one, though, his beautiful research assistant, Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), is hit by a Washington subway. Accident or suicide? Meanwhile, disheveled but ace reporter for ""The Washington Globe,"" Cal McAffery (Crowe), is writing a story on a mysterious shooting of two men - a street thief and a pizza delivery guy - by an unknown assailant that, in the ""real"" world would have nothing whatsoever to do with the Baker death. But, guess what? Somehow, there IS a connection.Reluctantly teaming up with a Web blogger, Della Frye (Rachel McAdams, ""Red Eye,"" ""The Wedding Crashers""), McAffery suspects that the security company is somehow responsible for what's going on. He's also a very close friend of Collins (especially Collin's estranged wife, Penn, an Academy Award nominee for playing ""Jenny"" in ""Forrest Gump""), so the Globe's staff thinks he may have a bias in favor of the politician.A tweaker then provides McAffrey with some stealth photos taken of Baker found in a briefcase her street thief/victim boyfriend boosted. This connects the two together, but the paper's gruff editor, Cameron Lynne (Mirren) wants a more concrete connection (editors are funny that way).A wild-eyed assassin, Robert Bingham, then begins knocking off people for some reason, and makes an attempt on both Frye and McAffrey's lives for sniffing too close. Meanwhile, the two are aided by a montage which compacts six months worth of journalistic investigation into one jump cut, resulting in a possible link from the security company to the murders.Then, after all that work and writing and holding up the presses of a major metropolitan daily news publication for over eight hours (which would NEVER happen in ""real"" life), Macdonald tosses a curve ball grenade right at us. It's not really THAT much of a surprise (I kind of figured it out early on), but it's a nice twist, nonetheless.The film takes off rather nicely, sails along with a competent story and decent acting, but there are some flaws. First of all, the lack of chemistry between Crowe and McAdams - as veteran and rookie - is painfully obvious (someone on this site actually wrote that it was comparable to Robert Redford's Bob Woodward and Dustin Hoffman's Carl Bernstin in ""All the President's Men,"" but don't believe that for a minute).I've never been a fan of McAdams, who was absolutely horrid in ""Red Eye,"" and is not much better here. I never get the feeling that she knows anything about being a reporter/blogger, despite being hired by a large daily newspaper for some reason. Also, Crow is far too low key to be a believable investigative journalist.There's also no back story on why he and Collins were friends or what led to their falling out. We're just supposed to accept it.The pacing, which starts off nice, drags near the middle, slowing everything to a crawl for a while. To be fair, things do accelerate towards the conclusion, but the slow part is really boring. Also, try to ignore the dozens of unrelated and unnecessary shots of helicopters in flight.Overall, not a bad picture, and Josh Mostel (""City Slickers"") adds what comic relief there is in a pretty sullen experience.",State of Play

137,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Nice Political Thriller!!,7,2 February 2014,"State of Play. Nothing thrills like a good thriller but it can be ruined if you do not sum it up perfectly in the end. Same happens here. When a congressional aide is killed, a Washington D.C. journalist played by Russel Crowe starts investigating the case involving the congressman, his old college friend Ben Affleck. As plot uncovers himself, you watch keenly and then brace yourself for a thrilling finale. In fact it arrives but then it gets twisted and turn into a convoluted ending. Not all the good work is ruined because you had your fun during the journey. Like any slick thriller that Hollywood produces on mass scale, this one also has good script, a well known cast, apt back ground score, good performances, detailed scenes, subtle references, delicious dialogues and being a political thriller it gives you some insight into the darkness of politics, corporate culture and military. So watch it if you are craving for a good thriller and keep your expectations low for the surprising finale.",State of Play

Watching a solid, well-done film like STATE, is like watching a good athlete or an outstanding performerThey all make it look SO EASY!Just take an interesting, dynamic story; convert that into a cohesive, believable sounding screenplay; do your casting well, so you get a cast that can breathe life into the characters; craft the music to heighten the mood/ambiance at hand; edit the scenes for maximum impact and always know where you're going and be sure you take the movie in the direction of your vision!

A powerhouse cast, that doesn't disappoint: Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Helen Mirren, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, Jason Bateman, and Jeff Daniels WOW! Did the A-list want IN on this project, or what?!? Although Crowe does a fine job, he falls a little short of true excellence. A difficult task, attempting to shine when surrounded by ALL that talent! One surprise: Ben Affleck, not exactly on my favorite ""actors"" list, turns in a deviously devilish performance as the congressman who is keenly aware of his media image and how to protect it.But the big jaw-dropper here is Jason Bateman. His characterization fooled me completely! Had to wait for the credits to see who he was! His Uber- creepy-bottom-feeder-sleaze-ball was the film's real revelation!

139,David_Frames,Washington De-ceased,7,26 April 2009,"Russell Crowe's Washington hack investigates the apparent suicide of a researcher on Capitol Hill and the murder of a drug dealer, discovering that, somewhat terrifyingly, all roads lead to Ben Affleck's congressman and his crusade against a unscrupulous defense contractor in this solid, if unexceptional compression of Paul Abbot's highly regarded BBC serial.Several questions permeate the mind as 'Play' unfolds, namely why doesn't a single colleague of Crowe's ask how or why he acquired the hair of a forty year woman and can the skin around Affleck's eyes really be 15 years older than the rest of his face? These investigative omissions not withstanding, all strands of Abbot's plot remain well entwined and although necessarily truncated for the purposes of adaptation, lose nothing of the intrigue that made the TV series manna for the optic nerves.Kevin McDonald, last seen helming The Last King of Scotland, keeps the tempo up and pastes each frame together with thick set suspense but although State of Play grips from the outset it's an efficient rather than scintillating couple of hours. What's missing you feel, is the depth of character that the longer running time of the television series afforded.Crowe, our guide to the underbelly of Washington shadow politics and newsroom maneuvering, imbues his journo with an easy manner and a quick wit, but for someone up against a conspiracy involving a slew of homicides and the top echelons of government, seldom lets his canter become a run as he frowns his way to the awful truth. Affleck meanwhile, is never entirely convincing as the libidinous career politician with powerful enemies, gawping when you imagine he was reaching for shock and occasionally very angry indeed when someone behind the camera holds up a white card with 'emotion' scrawled on it. This is a shame because the part, formerly the property of David Morrissey, misses the Gordon Brown lookalike's heft, while the miscast malformed twin of Matt Damon can do little more than oscillate between composed and tearful. If 'Play' is essentially a two hander between the Journalist and the Politician, Affleck's lack of muscle ""Beadle's"" the enterprise – one good hand and one withered grabbing the viewer and it's not quite the same.Mind you, despite the occasionally underpowered leads no-one involved is anything less than adequate, Helen Mirren's newspaper editor and Rachel McAdams eye candy hackette providing assured support despite pared down roles. Always watchable and often involving, it's not the bravura thriller it might have been but it won't give Paul Abbot a reason to sue either – besides one day they'll have the technology to paint Affleck out and replace him with a young James Stewart – imagine that.",State of Play

But isn't that what American politics are all about? I had trepidations about seeing Russell Crowe, as I find him totally repulsive for how he has treated underlings here in the USA, but from the first frame of the film, to the last, he is brilliant in his role and his character drives the story. Helen Mirren is perfect as a ""Ben Bradley"" and Rachel McAdams once again proves herself on the screen as a very talented actor. The film moves at a fast pace, the dark exteriors of D.C. add to the darkness of the story, and the ending had me surprised, but then again, this is about power and how it corrupts those who have it, and can lose it in a second.

But instead of the buddy reporter being a guy, Della Frye (Rachel McAdams)—also representing the online part of the newspaper (a Washington Post lookalike named the Globe) shows up to pester Cal to let her in on his way of going after hard news. She makes a good foil for the veteran print warrior, but this movie is another Russell Crowe powerhouse... his is the life force that serves as the prime mover behind practically every scene, even the ones he's not in.But aside from these observations about acting, which truthfully I know nothing about, it's a rewarding experience to have a dominant sort like Crowe strengthen such a plot-centered film. (Can you imagine Casablanca without Humphrey Bogart, Bullit without Steve McQueen, Good Will Hunting without Matt Damon (and Robin Williams), etc.?)

It's well-written; each scene builds up suspense. The ending isn't what the viewer expects, but it's adroitly conceived, to say the least.
The film affirms the power of Investigative Journalism, and the pursuit of the unvarnished truth before fake news became fashionable.
The story tackles the emerging power and financial clout of private military contractors in the body politic, a congressman's noble crusade against one of them and his unfortunate fall from grace, and a journalist's dogged determination to uncover the truth, no matter where it leads.
This is Russel Crowe's movie, and he thrives in his role as the go-getting journalist Cal McAffrey. Ben Affleck, as Congressman Stephen Collins, reminds the viewer of the young JFK. Affleck is given sufficient exposure but definitely plays a secondary role which limits what he can do in front of the camera. The venerable Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman and Jeff Daniels play significant, credible roles that enliven the plot. Alas, this can't be said of Rachel McAdams who, as newbie reporter Della Frye, seems lacking in spontaneity and depth.

148,ligonlaw,Not a Boring Split-Second,10,18 May 2009,"It was a tough challenge to make a film from the BBC series of the same name. We rented the BBC's ""State of Play"" and could not wait for the next episode.We Americans have seen cops do everything - legal and illegal - in the thriller genre. What made the BBC series intriguing was the twist that the investigation was being conducted by journalists. Reporters do not need admissible evidence and are not under the same restrictions as the police and district attorneys. What is fit to print may not be admissible in court, but it may be factual and the plain truth. The BBC series may be the best thing to ever appear on television, so the writers, directors and actors in this film were dealing not only with rich material but a high bar for dramatic achievement.The essentials of the British television drama were contained in this movie, but the television series ran slightly more than 5 hours, and this movie ran 2 hours and 10 minutes. Necessarily, many of the interesting journalistic ruses and background stories were eliminated in order to streamline the story for the big screen.The American film was sharper than the British version, because the story takes place in Washington rather than London. At times, State of Play resembled another great thriller ""Enemy of the State."" The Bush years have provided writers with a rich backdrop of corrupt, sinister characters merging corporate greed and venal government officials. The film rings true when it suggests that shadowy operatives stand ready to commit atrocities in the name of patriotism. Anyone attempting to find the truth may be in mortal danger.Russell Crowe plays the veteran reporter Cal McAffrey. One might expect more Oscar nominations for his performance. Ben Affleck plays the rising star politician who is the center of controversy and the suspect in a murder of a young woman. The cast is star-studded and includes Helen Mirren as Crowe's exasperated editor. She is operating a newspaper, which, like most newspapers, is threatened by the demise of news print. Rachel McAdams is more or less Crowe's sidekick, who disapproves of his ethical lapses but admires his results.State of Play is a must-see movie. It delivers excitement, insight and drama.

149,gcrokus,Topicql Thriller,8,2 May 2009,"There aren't many conspiracy films or books that I have ever really liked. I find such conjecture exhausting. Regarding movies, the best of the bunch in recent years is ""L.A. Confidential"", and I measure anything being released against it. ""State of Play"" stacks up reasonably well. It happens to have a hint of plausibility, has some good actors delivering good performances and (unlike the former) it is about a contemporary predicament.The movie opens in full action sequence mode; a man on the run is cornered and essentially murdered, as is a witness. Within a few minutes the seemingly unrelated but equally brutal death at a train station of a woman also occurs. Soon thereafter reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) begins to put together these and a few other threads that lead him to believe there is more to these stories than anyone suspects.Representative Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck), a friend of McAffrey's, has been investigating a security corporation deeply profiting from government contracts. It turns out that the woman killed at the train station is not only an assistant to Collins but was his love as well. McAffrey, now reluctantly teamed with fellow reporter Dell Frye (Rachel McAdams) is now in full investigative mode.The twists and turns of the plot are, refreshingly, able to be followed. The director (Kevin MacDonald, noted for ""The Last King of Scotland"") leads us handily through the web of deceit, money, sex and even emotional highs and lows of the characters involved. There is a relentless pace to the film; the only real cliché being the deadline the reporters are pitched against.Ben Affleck seems to be paralleling George Clooney's career path to a degree; both have been successful actors and both have stints behind the camera with good results. He is well cast as the congressman with an agenda. Affleck is doing smart films (witness ""Gone Baby Gone"") and we the audience can appreciate both his substance and style.Russell Crowe's performance is pretty engrossing as he portrays a veteran reporter not particularly in the favor of Editor Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren). Perhaps some will find his squalid life and unkempt appearance a bit of an anachronism in what is now a corporate world (Lynne repeatedly brings this to his attention) but it doesn't detract from the overall story. At least a solid attempt is made in this film to present a story that can be followed. And way to its credit very little is made of the more and more prevalent method of filming is such darkness that the actual goings-on are virtually impossible to follow.Three Stars.",State of Play
150,eastbergholt2002,Good but the BBC series was better,7,3 May 2009,"State of Play is an enjoyable and intelligent thriller. The problem is that the original BBC mini-series on which it's based was so much better. The original version was riveting television. The film Americanizes the plot introducing many stock Hollywood archetypes. The conspiracy now involves a shadowy-Blackwater type company with ties to the military. Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is now a grizzled but stereotypical investigative reporter. Stephen Collins (Ben Afflek) is a former war hero who becomes a Senator. These changes make it seem like your typical Hollywood political thriller. However there is still enough of the original story left to make it worth watching.The strength of the film is in the acting and most of the cast deliver top drawer performances. Helen Mirren and Jason Bateman are particularly memorable. Russell Crowe still has a commanding screen presence but he seemed miscast as McAffrey. He gave a lazy, disappointing, performance and seemed too old, overweight and disheveled to be believable as Ben Affleck's best friend and Robin Wright Penn's former lover. Crowe smirked a lot and was too smug and laid back. He often dissipated any tension the film generated. In the BBC series McAffrey almost hero worships Stephen Collins, but there was little of that dynamic here. It's a good movie, but I was a little disappointed. It should have been a lot better.",State of Play

If you want to see a classic style movie that is cunning, interesting and lets you have fun with your imagination, you have to see this movie.In the waning years of the newspaper industry, we see a very classy Helen Mirren play a ""Devil wears Prada""-ish editor who runs The Washington Globe. Overpowering his boss(with charm and experience, of course), Russell Crowe is the very type of gutsy(almost brave) newspaper reporter that anyone who wanted to be in his shoes can admire.

152,joker-4,A Great Newspaper Story,9,18 July 2012,"STATE OF PLAY, the film from director Kevin McDonald (LAST KING OF Scotland, TOUCHING THE VOID) and screenwriter Tony Gilroy (BOURNE trilogy, DUPLICITY), successfully incorporates the high points from the successful BBC miniseries of the same name but does something the series could not, which is the incorporation of the near-irrelevance of print media into a much-better-than-standard conspiracy thriller.In the film, seasoned newspaper writer Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is led into story involving assassins, military contractors, a U.S. Congressman (Ben Affleck), his wife (Robin Wright Penn), an affair and even a few murders, just for emphasis. Affleck's Stephen Collins, a friend of McAffrey's, is caught in an affair with his aide after she is found dead, and then pronounced murdered. McAffrey helps his friend, and Collins' wife, but is truly committed to the story, as well as any truths that might be associated along with that. The ""quest for the story"" element is how the film differs from the mini- series, which was more involved in the personal relations of the key characters. Set in the end of the 21st Century's first decade, Crowe's McAffrey is dedicated to the dying art of investigative journalism, which is quickly being replaced with up-to-second blogs, represented in the film by young writer Della Frye (Rachel McAdams). Overseeing, and adding to, this tension is the editor-in-chief Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren), who is giving both reporters a short-leash leeway with their respective styles but is ultimately concerned with circulation, satisfying a corporate buy-out and keeping her staff employed. Cal and Della work – and work well – both as independent rogues as well as uneasy partners in a pseudo-traditional mentor/apprentice relationship as they deal with both the story and the future of the newspaper biz. The conspiracy elements of the film are good with plenty of keep-the-audience-guessing moments along with a few comedic bits from Jason Bateman, whose character has had dealings with the murdered aide. However even more interesting is how STATE OF PLAY comes across as a love letter to the dying newspaper breed with Cal passing the pen-and- paper torch off to Della's blogs and tweets.",State of Play

It knows just what punches to pull, and when to pull them.The script, written by political scribes Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilory and Billy Ray, is insight and intriguing. It could have easily been made boring and inundated with rehashed politicalisms (like all of their last films), but this film revels in how interesting it becomes. It has laughs strung throughout (a genuine surprise), and lacks the nerve to become loaded to the brim with facts and innuendos. Instead, it expertly weaves between scenes, amping up the intensity of some scenes, and downplaying others.But this is mainly due to the incredible performances by the cast. Crowe (who I usually loathe) and Affleck are simply outstanding in their roles. Age issues aside, both play their character with finesse and charisma. Affleck looks and acts like a confused wet-behind-the- ears, gunning-for-higher-office political pawn from beginning to end. Some of the reactions on his face are downright devastating in how excellently they are conveyed. And this is a guy critics once said could not act. Coupled with one-two shot of acting in Hollywoodland and directing Gone Baby Gone, we may be seeing a renewed resonance and importance for the Oscar-winner. Crowe on the other hand, delivers his strongest performance in years. While he has been downplayed and underused in his last few films, he carries this film. He is stubborn and vaguely likable, but he makes his character work for all of his idiosyncrasies and ethically-questionable tactics. He makes a seasoned journalist look like an amateur.McAdams, all but a ghost recently, holds her own against the two heavy-hitters and delivers a performance that is both inspired and emotional. It gives her a lot of room to act, and she delivers in every instance. The rest of the cast is a bit mixed however, as so little of them is given that much to do. Harry Lennix, Robin Wright Penn, Jeff Daniels, the horrifying Michael Berresse and especially Jason Bateman, all deliver noteworthy performances, but never get to really shine in them. They all have their traits and motivations, but get little screen time to truly express them. They each are developed quite strongly, but they lack the movement afforded to Crowe, Affleck and McAdams. I simply loved Helen Mirren's scenery-gauging editor and all of her subtleties. But she too, is downplayed to the point of almost barely being in the film.Despite its intensity, the film is bogged down by its dialogue-heavy scenes and consistent character additions. It is easy to keep track of everyone, but so many people are introduced that the film loses its focus on more than one occasion. It makes for a few scenes that are merely filler between the scenes of useful heavy acting. It just feels so tiring. I understand now how daunting a task it must have been to convert six hours of British television into a 127-minute film, but there are scenes that are just too easy to not have been cut out (some entire mildly useful subplots may have helped). Adding characters in makes sense for a story about two journalists frantically searching to lift the lid on a story, but there needs to be more emphasis on what was needed and not needed. A brilliant montage in the middle of the film goes almost entirely to waste because the filmmakers lack the knowledge of what should be cut. Limiting the preposterous and silly climax could have also done wonders. The scenes that are left in the film (including the finale) are great, but they could have been stronger if they were as tightly wound as the film wants itself to be. A little less shaky hand camera movement could have also significantly benefited the film.Even with its problems, it is clear from the on-set of the first shot in the bullpen at the Washington Globe that the filmmakers are going for a very keen sense of homage to All the President's Men. While the on-going and very professional relationship between McAffrey and Frye is very similar to Woodward and Bernstein, the fabric of journalistic integrity and researching are the core of State of Play. The film is loaded with allusions to the Oscar- winning film, and even mimics shots right out of the film. While it is obvious for anyone who has seen Men, this film's nods are done in such a delicate and unique way that they never become distracting or blatant. The film is its own, and does not ever feel like it is living in its big-brother's shadow. It is a fresh take on old-fashioned reporting in a very digital age, and frequently walks the tight line of old versus new.State of Play looked interesting, and surprisingly delivers on almost every count. It is not a perfect film, but it is a solid example of great film-making. It wants to be more, but seems content at being a twisty and suspenseful modern thriller. Evren Buyruk USA",State of Play
157,98nurdinm-1,State Of Play,7,18 February 2011,"Washington: Up and coming politician Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is beginning talks with a major private security company when he is informed of the death of one of his staff. His emotional response threatens to damage not just the talks but also potentially his career and marriage. Meanwhile, his old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), a reporter for the Washignton Globe, is following the story of a young murdered black boy. It isn't long until the two events are mysteriously linked...""State Of Play"" started life as a brilliant six-part British television drama created by Paul Abbott who, among other projects, was responsible for ""Shameless"" and ""Clocking Off"". It was high-edge, fast-paced and well executed, with an amazing cast including John Simm, David Morrissey and an award-winning Bill Nighy. What's perhaps most interesting about THIS version is how well it transposes to the big screen without you really missing a lot of that. The storyline, though slightly modified, stays as sharp and tight as it did in the series. Washington looks spectacular as a setting for this, arguably the first big-budget political thriller to be set there since ""All The President's Men"", which this clearly apes in several key moments, most notably the use of the infamous Watergate hotel by the private security company in a sly nod. What the film captures too is the feel of a newspaper at work as well as a newspaper under threat - even when the television series was made the impact of Internet Blogs and such were yet to be fully felt by newspapers. Now there is a real danger for all concerned that soon they will become very much obsolete, fears well portrayed in Helen Mirren's portrayal of the editor.Sadly, though Mirren is very good, she is not on screen long enough to make the same kind of impact that Nighy was able to make in the original role. Robin Wright, as Collins' wife, is underused too, though this is because the secondary storyline in the series of a relationship between her and Cal is demoted here to a one night stand in the past. Also slightly wasted is Rachel McAdams, playing the role of Della that was played by Kelly MacDonald. Wheras there Della was more of a pro, here she is a newbie, a blogger being introduced to the world of real journalism. Her naivety sometimes grates with the rest of the film.Much more convincing are Crowe and Affleck; the latter in particular makes up for the dodgy choices he has made film wise in the past and begins his long walk to triumph with a very fine performance. Crowe too shows us the same kind of dogged determination that he did in his brilliant performance in ""LA Confidential"", though more world-weary. The supporting cast do well, although Jeff Daniels is relegated to a rather 2D politician; in particular Jason Bateman is very impressive as a slimy rich good-for-nothing who ends up involved in the case.What is great about the film is that, for the most part, it can stand up on its own next to it's television cousin. Sadly, it just comes a little short to the expectations you might have for it based on its relative. Perhaps better to watch if you have never seen the show before.7/10",State of Play

But there were minor criticisms.The police spend most of the movie complaining about the press who is actually doing their work for them.They supposedly investigated the murder of the homeless man. They confiscated all his possessions, including his cellphone. But they don't look at the contents. Cal (Russell Crowe) has to write down the numbers and find out the homeless guy was calling the Congressional aide who was murdered in the subway station.The hitman is portrayed as cold blooded and efficient. Always disappearing whenever the police show up. But in the final climax he confronts Cal. Instead of just killing him, he has a long conversation with him as he can hear the police sirens approaching. Instead of disappearing, he gets in a shootout with ten cops behind car doors whose guns are already drawn. What happened to cold blooded and efficient?This is a good movie.

Not sure of the details, but the movie certainly didn't suffer from Pitt's absence. Crowe was great as the lead.

McAdams has always been a favorite actress of mine and does a fantastic job in this movie.

162,MetalAngel,"A nicely done thriller, and overall, an enjoyable movie.",8,6 September 2009,"You hear the words ""Kevin Macdonald directs, Tony Gilroy co-writes, Russell Crowe stars and it involves double agents, political disorder and big corporation cover-ups."" Basically, you're hearing what a really good movie is gonna be about. You hear ""State of Play"", which is indeed Kevin Macdonald's latest film, and I must say it really is everything I hoped it would be.It's about this reporter (Russell Crowe), who's usually really laid back and easy-going but who's really very keen, witty and intelligent. And then there's this insanely hot girl (Rachel McAdams), who's just been hired to write the newspaper blog on the Internet. There's also this case of a young African American who was involved in drugs and who was killed the night before and another young man who now lays in a coma at the hospital, also the victim of the same cold-blooded killer, and who happens to have identified him.Then there's also the case of an important worker woman who happens to have suffered a little 'accident' and fallen in front of a subway train, and we soon discover she was having an affair with a congressman (Ben Affleck) who just happens to be married. Naturally, the drug/murder story is given to the intelligent, easy-going expert reporter and the congressman scandal is given to the blog writer for them to take care of, and they dutifully research their topics and write really good stories.But when we suddenly discover that the deceased drug-dealer was, in some way, connected with the dead congressman's lover, both reporters have to team up to cover the intertwining stories, while their editor (Helen Mirren) puts pressure on them because the newspaper might just go down and tries to protect their sources from a very inquisitive police force. What can be expected after this is a very complicated thriller plot with conveniently intelligent twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. And the film does deliver! The acting is very decent on all sides. Crowe down-plays his usual bad-boy film character for this reporter keen on discovering the truth, McAdams is cool and (of course) interested in this new, big case, Helen Mirren is (expectably) perfect and Robin Wright Penn as the congressman's wife is entrancing, portraying a woman who's pain-stricken because of her husband but who tries to remain calm and to calm the heat from the press as well.The plot is almost pure perfection (notice the word 'almost'). Apparently, the film takes itself really seriously (as it should), but to a point where there is really little exploration into the characters themselves (with the obvious exception of Crowe and McAdams). Also, the music is good but doesn't completely compliment the plot. The photography is adequate but not impressive, and...no, that's about the only bad points I can encounter in the movie.I mean, for a two-hour film based on a six-hour miniseries, this is a really impressive achievement. Kevin Macdonald, once again, shows us that his greatness didn't all go into ""The Last King of Scotland"", and that he can still wow us with intelligent and absorbing films. You can't miss this one!

164,kimi_layercake,"""An Excellent Film Burglarized By A Ridiculous Twist Ending""",7,28 August 2009,"State Of Play is a Political Thriller that will keep you glued to your seat until the climax where the movie veers straight away from the plot. Rather the viewer will be gasping to see the connections between the climax and the plot so far. Cause there's literally nothing about the climax that is hinted nor disclosed during the entire course of the movie. It's just like the movie ends abruptly without doing anything with the investigations, chase, murder, revelations so far.The Casting is superb. Every Actor is stitch-perfect for their role. Russell Crowe dominates the movie as usual with good rapport from Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams and others. The Direction and Screenplay is top- notch with a nice Soundtrack to fall back on. The Director deserves kudos for keeping the characters intact and the tension engaging. Overall, it's a good movie which could have been an excellent movie.

166,Reel_starz,A tense thriller with top-notch acting and writing,8,26 April 2009,"About a month before State of Play came into theaters, I read an article in The Washington Post (I live in the D.C. area) about the realism of the news industry as portrayed in the movie. One of the Post reporters served as a consultant on the set and I must say that he seems to have done his job. Almost every aspect, from the constantly chaotic state of the newsroom to the reporter-lingo, feels authentic and true to reality. While there are occasional times when the movie's main character, the reporter Cal McCaffrey, strays from the usual ethical and professional guidelines, there are logical explanations for such instances that are given in the movie. At one point, Russell Crowe even ad-libs a line about the outdated technology he has compared to the state-of-the-art computers given to Della Fry, Rachel McAdams's gossipy blogger: ""I've been here fifteen years, I've got a sixteen year old computer. She's been here fifteen minutes and she's got enough gear to launch a f***ing satellite."" This line was inspired by the feud between print journalists and their online counterparts that, according to the Post reporter, exists in real-life. Because journalism is so crucial to the story of State of Play, every minute detail contributes greatly to the believability of the film as a whole and it is this attention to detail that really elevates State of Play above the average political thriller.The cast, which includes three Oscar winners, though Ben Affleck won for screen writing, could not be more perfect. With his long, shaggy hair, bulging belly and old, trash-littered car, Russell Crowe looks appropriately scruffy and he disappears into his role, becoming one of the most convincing journalists on screen in recent years. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, especially Brad Pitt, who was originally signed on for the part. As his partner on the story, Rachel McAdams delivers, giving her character a very energetic yet idealistic flavor. Della Fry is, at least in the beginning, a rather obnoxious woman but, in large part due to McAdams, she gradually becomes more likable and we learn to accept her for who she is. Helen Mirren is splendid as Cameron, McCaffery and Fry's insistent boss, and every time she appears, the screen comes alive (not that it's dead when she isn't there). Ben Affleck once again proves that he can act when given the right material. He gives his character, a promising congressman, an air of detached arrogance mixed with frustrated vulnerability. Representative Stephen Collins certainly has his principles but throughout the film, that sense of morality is largely shrouded in secrets and mystery and the audience is forced to constantly guess and re-guess his true intentions. Aside from the main actors, the supporting cast does a terrific job with a slightly comedic, almost delightfully over-the-top performance by Jason Bateman as a pretentious PR agent. Also worth noting is Viola Davis, who plays a contact of McCaffrey's in the morgue, and even though she only appears in one scene, she makes the most of that short screen-time that, in turn, makes us remember her well.Other than the superb cast, one of the most impressive things about State of Play is the script, which was written by Tony Gilroy, Billy Ray and Matthew Michael Carnahan and based on the 2003 BBC mini-series of the same name. However, it bears Tony Gilroy's distinctive mark not only because it involves corporate conspiracies and unending twists, but the witty dialogue could have been written by almost no one else. Occasional instances of humor help lighten the otherwise rather dark mood. Also, the writing is highly intelligent and makes the audience actually think rather than simply go along with the complicated plot. This can also be contributed to the direction of Kevin MacDonald who, after winning an Oscar for his documentary One Day in September in 1999 and directing the Oscar-winning feature film The Last King of Scotland, proves that he has loads of talent and hopefully, will remain prominent in the film-making industry.Other noteworthy aspects of the movie are the cinematography and the score, both of which help carry the tension throughout the entire two-and-a-half hour film, even during quieter scenes. However, State of Play is not quite perfect. The main, and perhaps only, flaw is the minor plot holes that, while virtually unnoticeable during the actual viewing of the movie, become more obvious upon dissecting the movie afterwards. It is impossible to discuss these errors in detail without giving anything away, but they do make the conclusion a little less satisfying.Nonetheless, the movie is so good in all other areas that it is still easy to overlook the implausibility of the ending. From the virtually flawless cast and writing to the authenticity of its portrayal of journalists and the thought-provoking political themes, State of Play stands out among all the conventional political thrillers churned out by Hollywood in recent years.

While it was good in places, the overall film does not live the director's last film due to several reasons.State of Play has a strong cast that includes Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck, both of whom are really good but the script doesn't always allow for them to really shine. Even though Russell Crowe is good, there is sense of connection to his character and that is the same for Rachel McAdams' character. Helen Mirren gives a solid performance, as does Ben Affleck while Jason Bateman nearly steels the entire film as a sleazy PR man. The story does progress at a steady pace but without any connection for the characters it is difficult to care. There is a sub-plot with Russell Crowes character who had an affair with his best friends wife but it never becomes interesting and feels like a poor effort to add character depth. There were a couple of scenes that were interesting and the underlying theme of how the internet will eventually kill off the newspaper adds some weight to the story. One scene sees Russell Crowe hiding in an underground car park and it is very tense but once the film has ended, you will soon forget about it. The film does have an audience in-mind but for everyone else there is no real reason to see this unless you are a fan of the director's previous films.

Acting is good, camera and edit well paced and a text-book thiller-story with enough twisters to keep it running.But the film misses - as usual in B-category thrillers - a real arena. Characters pop up from the dark with no backstory-responsibility to it. The evil cooperation misses faces and a location. Washington as a location misses civilians and streets with things happening. Hellen Mirror's bosses are never seen, which makes her fear for their judgment ridiculous. Etc....
To accomplish a suffocating feel of abandonment, this skipping of information and visuals would have been a good choice - leaving out an arena is indeed used in cult-thrillers many times - but this is not that kind of film. This drama plays in the world of journalism and inter-human connections and needs more then just characters running alone in the night, disconnected from daily life.It makes SofP a bit unbelievable and it's characters a bit artificial.

A particular interesting role is that of Jason Bateman as a quasi-curious PR exec.

182,walkerus,"Murder, attempted murder, who cares?",8,18 January 2015,"This movie, although good watching, has more holes than a box of cheese graters. 1) My biggest grouch is why the murderer (Bingham) is allowed to walk around the place in perfect freedom when everybody knows he killed Sonia Baker and tried to assassinate Cal and shot up a car full of people causing a major collision with another car etc. etc. ..... and yet the newspaper, who have his photo, don't put his photo on the front page of their newspaper and the police are not searching for him.2) Why would a bag-snatcher (Deshaun) keep a meeting with a guy who's obviously into blackmail or stalking and has a gun and special killing bullets in his briefcase, surely he would have had enough street-smarts to know when not to follow through with his MO. Even his girlfriend had enough reasoning to work out the case owner was a nutter. And how was he going to sell back the briefcase without the contents anyway, surely Deshaun's method calls for the case and contents to be returned for cash?.3) Who actually called for the killing of Sonia Baker, was it Stephen who found out she was working for PointCorp (but he was supposedly in love with her). Was it PointCorp because she had stopped supplying information (surely killing her was going over the top, just stop paying her $26,000 a month would have sufficed). Was it Bingham who took her assassination into his own hands.4) Why was Bingham allowed to sit in the hospital corridor (without an identification label) outside the comatose Pizza Guy's room (which is guarded by a policeman who is also sat in the corridor alongside the murderer) when we see Della have to go through ID check to be allowed in to the hospital and has to wear an ID badge....... by the way, it was good of the policeman to walk up to the murderer and then speak on the cell phone that ""He's coming round"", which signed the death warrant for the Pizza Guy.I could mention several more silly loopholes that make 'State of Play' what could have been a first class movie into a muddle of a thriller.",State of Play

Once you've seen a tastefully done, intelligent film actually aimed at adults instead of teeny boppers, you just have to admit to yourself you're in for a two month dry spell.""State of Play"", the remake of a 2003 BBC mini-series, is one of those rarities. An all-star cast comprised of Russell Crowe, Helen Mirren, Robin Wright Penn, and the criminally underrated Jeff Daniels work together with less experienced thespians such as Rachel McAdams, Ben Affleck and Arrested Development's Jason Bateman, all under the confident guidance of Scotland's cinematic pride Kevin Macdonald, whose ""The Last King of Scotland"" gets defined by Forest Whitaker tour-de-force acting but never on it's own merits, unfortunately.The title ""State of Play"" is defined as ""the current political situation"", what's the status of the players in the political field at this very moment. And that's exactly where the film takes off. A multi-national company by the name of Pointcorp supplying the bulk of arms to the US's oversea forces is under investigation by Congressman Collins (Ben Affleck). When the lead researcher of Collins' team dies under suspicious circumstances, investigative reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) starts turning over rocks and finds himself between a rock and a hard place when he's cornered by his own boss and PointCorp's unofficial employees, the more he pulls the roots of the tree out of the ground, the more he realizes how far PointCorp's influence has spread.Regulars of ""Arrested Development"", or folks who watched last year's summer blockbuster ""Hancock"" will be pleasantly surprised by Jason Bateman's impressive dramatic performance.

However, the movie itself left me wanting. The plot was straightforwardnearly predictable. The twist at end was pointless because I was too exhausted by the end of the movie to understand how the new development played a part. The movie was entertaining, yet too long to be enjoyable. It just seemed to lack the ""umph!"" and quite frankly the movie seemed to overly complicatedfor now reason. There was some comic relief in the movie, such as any dialogue with the newspaper editor Cameron (Helen Mirren), now that lady has spunk! She was one sassy woman, role model material ;-) Another character I find funny on the big screen is Jason Bateman who played Dominic Foy. The only way I know how to describe Jason Bateman is wittily entertaining. The detective, Det. Donald Bell (Harry Lennix) is an actor I wish to have had more screen time.

186,wonderdawg,Film is really a meditation on the state of print journalism in the age of the Internet disguised as a thriller,8,23 September 2009,"They don't make a whole lot of movies with crusading newspapermen anymore. In fact the last good one I remember is ""All the President's Men"". Like the 1976 Robert Redford-Dustin Hoffman classic, ""State of Play"" (new on DVD and Blu-Ray) is all about an intrepid Washington newspaper and its role in uncovering high level government corruption. One is fact and one is fiction. Both films are products of their times. Think of Russell Crowe's character, Washington Globe reporter Cal McCaffrey, as Woodward and Bernstein rolled into one and the Globe as a thinly disguised version of the Washington Post. (The producers hired Post metro editor R.B. Brenner as a consultant to ensure the depiction of big time journalism in action is as accurate as possible.) Like most veteran reporters he doesn't consider online bloggers to be real journalists. So he is less than civil when Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) seeks his input for a story she is writing for the paper's online edition on an alleged romance between Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) and his comely research assistant , Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer). ""Do you think he was having an affair with that girl?"" Della asks. ""Gee, Della, I'd have to read a couple of blogs before I could have an opinion, "" McCaffrey replies sarcastically. Helen Mirren plays Globe publisher Cameron Lynne. Her character may be modelled on real life Post publisher Katherine Graham but a lot has changed since Graham's heyday. For one thing, Lynne seems to be more worried about the bottom line than responsible journalism. She knows that a story on government corruption is a better story but the scoop on the Congressman's sexual indiscretions will sell more papers and, as she tells McCaffrey, ""Our new owners have this odd idea we should be turning a profit."" ""Yeah, well, I hear our online side is doing great, "" he snaps."" I've been here, what, 15 years? I use a 16 year old computer. She's been here 15 minutes and she could launch a Russian satellite with the gear she's got. ""Director Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) sets up the plot with deft, sure strokes. A teenage drug dealer is killed by a mysterious gunman. A young woman falls under a subway train. (At first the deaths seem unrelated.) We meet Congressman Collins. Married to his high school sweetheart (Robin Wright Penn) and chairing a Defense Department Subcomittee investigating the Pentagon's practice of hiring mercenaries to help U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iran he is definitely a star on the rise. The revelation of an affair between the Congressman and the recently deceased Ms. Baker sends his political career into a tailspin. That's when he looks to his old college buddy McCaffrey for help in spin control. ""You've got to be proactive"", McCaffrey advises his old chum, ""or you're just letting the bloodsuckers and the bloggers have another free shot at you.""Obviously the film doesn't mince words when it comes to portraying how veteran print journalists feel about those upstart online types. During one heated exchange the publisher defends Della: ""She's hungry, she's cheap and she churns out copy every hour.""""Yeah, I know"", McCaffrey shoots back. ""I'm overfed, I'm too expensive and I take way too long."" In a way they are both right. Della tends to jump to conclusions without doing the proper research in her rush to get copy online. McCaffrey is set in his ways and slow to embrace the new technology. However, it is McCaffrey who senses the potential in Della and insists she accompany him when he realizes the story is too big for one person to handle. When the pair pool their talents they begin to connect the dots between two seemingly unrelated deaths and uncover a story much more sinister than a simple sex scandal. ""State of Play"" is based on an acclaimed 2003 BBC TV series. Director McDonald, working with screenwriters Matthew Mark Carnahan (The Kingdom), Billy Ray (Breach) and Tony Gilroy (wrote Bourne pix, directed Michael Clayton) had the unenviable task of boiling down Paul Abbott's six part miniseries into a two hour feature film. Without access to the BBC-TV miniseries I cannot compare the British original with its Americanized counterpart. However, I can report that I found the film intelligent and intriguing. There are moments of genuine suspense (the scene in the parking garage where McCaffrey is stalked by a psychotic ex Special Ops type will keep you on the edge of the couch). However the dominant theme of the film seems to be the illustrious past and uncertain future of print journalism. ""It's kind of a requiem for newspapers ... a little last hurrah for the power of the press,"" Macdonald says on a behind-the-scenes DVD featurette. "" You start to think, 'What does society look like if we don't have reporters who are being the watchdogs for us?'""Let's leave the last word to McCaffrey. In one of the film's most dramatic scenes, the scruffy, ink-stained warrior (played by Crowe with his customary intensity) defiantly defends the role of traditional journalism in our modern wired world. ""You know, in the middle of all this gossip and speculation that permeates our daily lives I still think people know the difference between real news and bull****. And they're glad that someone cares enough to get things on the record and print the truth. """,State of Play

He simply stinks. The script: flawed and biased towards journalism. The plot: dissatisfying. My take on it: the Americans have been known to pump out movies for mob control. For example: when they decide to go to war again - they produce more war movies, to stimulate gambling - they produce movies depicting gamblers, and now, with journalism being in an absolute slump - they promote dedicated journalists. Pretty much anything you read in a news paper is either censored, edited to death or simply false. Characters portrayed by Mr.Crowe simply don't exist anymore.

Nonetheless extremely entertaining, especially for someone, who hasn't seen the BBC series by the same name. Contemporary setting along with a stellar cast led by Oscar Award Winners Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Oscar Award Nominee Helen Mirren & a very capable support cast carry the not so loophole proof screenplay, aptly. Crowe did what he does best. Sleep walk through the role looking very convincing as a tenured journalist for the fictitious daily ""Washington Globe"". Rachel McAdams looked the part and did a fine job as well. It is not the first of it's kind narration that primarily involves the aftermath of an event. What stands out for this enterprise though is that, it is an extremely cautious mix of tricks and turns, which neither gets too predictable nor too surprising at any given moment. This could also be the very reason why this movie may never attain any spectacular heights (critical appreciation) or break any paths. Nevertheless, myself being the classic rock fan that I am, lapped up every moment of the ending credits with glee as CCR's ""As Long as I can See The Light"" played on. Recommended for a week night viewing at a theater near You. I am expecting it to do better when it airs in prime time television. Overall : 7/10",State of Play
189,tha_mongoose,What a great thriller!,8,14 August 2009,"Everything in State of Play is as perfect as it can be. We all know Tinkertown has seen brighter days. Of late we are spammed with cheap excuses for movies, with little or no plots, where the ending can be seen in the movie-poster. Surprisingly, the screenplay and directing alone make this movie a splendid spectacle.Director Kevin Macdonald of The Last King of Scotland greatness indulges us in a fast-paced, well-sound-tracked and in general successfully led thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat for the full 2 hours and 7 minutes of its duration. To add to the package the writers (M. M. Carnahan of Lions for Lambs, Tony Gilroy of Duplicity, Michael Clayton, the Bourne Trilogy, etc, and Billy Ray of Breach and Hart's War) do a good job of converting a 6-episode TV series written by Paul Abbott, who incidentally also helped with the movie's screenplay, into a single feature. In its heavily condensed format, the viewer is treated to an intensely action-packed thriller full of twists and turns and manned by the acting ability to take it even further.The only mediocre performance in State of Play is that by Michael Berresse (the hit-man). On the other hand, Crowe and McAdams make an explosive duo that intertwines friction with mutual respect on a professional level as things progress. A stellar performance is already expected of Crowe - one that he delivers, carrying the movie through with such force we are prepared to accept and not even condone some of his more questionable actions in the past. What really shows is how dedicated he is to his job, from the fact he is on good terms with everyone that can basically aid him to obtain journalistic truth - this he strives for, above all else. With no barriers in his way, even friendship, he throws himself at stories, like he tells his boss at the start that ""take longer, mean he gets payed more for being an old-timer at the newspaper"" but in the end compensate). McAdams is worthy of mention, showing great attention to detail, really being that young, fresh, intelligent and energetic newbie reporter. Their boss Hellen Mirren, even with less screen time, is formidable in portraying the domineering traits common to such a stressful position (heading a newspaper in this case). Finally, Ben Affleck is a pleasant surprise. The actor's facial expressions are convincing and he manages to pull it through unambiguously. His wife Robin Wright Penn is also impressive, as are Jeff Daniels as the obviously corrupt politician making dough on the side and Jason Bateman as the odd PR, hurling some comedic relief at us as is his already-expected obligation.Things keep moving and changing at every turn, up to the very end. Perhaps what really does pull State of Play through with such success though is the fact that the film is entirely believable. Nowhere throughout the story does it stray from a plot that could indeed take place in real life, thus engaging you much more, for you are not forced to suspend your disbelief. Do yourself a favor and do not miss this picture. 8.5/10",State of Play
190,Hick_N_Hixville,Viva la Americana!,8,16 May 2009,"The real star of this movie is not an actor, but a piece of real estate.Back in 1999, I went to see ""Arlington Road,"" a thriller filmed in the Virginia suburbs and DC. Just a couple of months later I was in the DC area, staying at this old motel in Crystal City while trying to seduce a friend of mine (only one of several reasons I was there).Now, ten years later, I am back in a theater watching another thriller set in DC and the Virginia suburbs, probably just months away from another trip to DC to try and seduce a former co-worker (she is hotter than the friend and much less likely to be responsive, and if her marriage is still intact, I won't even try), and what do I see on the screen? The ""dump"" I stayed at back in '99, very meticulously portrayed too.The Americana Hotel is not exactly a ""dump."" It is a legendary tourist class motel literally minutes (during non rush hours) from the capitol. If you are a church group from Iowa looking for a cheap dig with shuttle service into DC, and no nonsense information about how to get around, this is your place. It's old, but at least ten years ago, the rooms were spotlessly clean, I would say cleaner than the rooms at the Marriott next door, so clean I had no reservations about soaking my hemorrhoids in the bathtub (not a spot of mold on the sparkling tile), and the beds Jason Bateman grumbled about in ""State of Play"" were actually very comfy. It was run by this older gent with a curt nasally Yankee accent and brisk manner who otherwise was quite helpful in his reserved way. Calling it a ""hotel"" is a stretch, but in the internet age that slight deception likely makes the old motel seem more important from a carefully designed website than it otherwise would be.I was actually thinking about staying in Georgetown this next trip (trying to be more impressive since she is hotter), but now after seeing ""State of Play"" I might stay one night back at the Americana, just to see if things are still as they were.Otherwise, ""State of Play"" is a very good political thriller. Russell Crowe is pitch perfect as an arrogant, slack, primo uomo reporter with a ""past"" intimate to the principal conspirators, and who (at least before the movie ends) presumes himself too much of a professional to try and bed his pretty younger female reporter partner.Ben Affleck, likewise, is perfectly cast as a slimy politician buried up to his eyeballs in lies and corruption.This flick is not exactly ""All the President's Men,"" but there is one close call in a parking garage (or as Jason Bateman's sexually omnivorous lounge lizard character would say, in a ""gay rage""), and the writing and acting in ""State of Play"" are well above average, enough to make it a very worthy way to spend an afternoon enjoying its vicarious, guilty pleasures. After seeing it, I can't wait to hit the Metro again, even if she won't answer her phone, or bother to return my voice mails.",State of Play
191,griffinfinity,"Extra, extra read all about it...'Solid , Gritty Thriller Captured on Blu-ray!'",7,10 September 2009,"'State of Play' is based on a BBC Television production of the same name. It is a political thriller set in Washington D.C. with the frantic edginess of 'All The President's Men'. There is even a suspense filled scene set in an underground parking garage. The Watergate Complex also makes a brief appearance. Perhaps, homage to Alan J. Pakula. Much of the film is shot in a vast, open newsroom. One simply cannot watch the film without thinking of the changes going on in real newsrooms. This is a credit to Director Kevin MacDonald, who paced the action well and made full use of the set.The plot revolves around the collision of two reporters, one old media, and the other new. Russell Crowe is the grizzled veteran, Cal. His style is hitting the streets and sniffing out the leads and sources that will break the story. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, Internet savvy and on the rise. When she enters Cal's world to assist with a big story, she is reminded that her status is that of a Cub Reporter. The source of it, the Ben Bradley-ish publisher, Helen Mirren. Ms. Mirren adds a nice, whiskey in the morning bent to the cast.Crowe is superb. His portrayal of 'Cal McAffrey' is intense, methodical, and steady. When the action kicks into high gear, Crowe's pace does as well. At times, he reminds me a bit of the immortal 'Aqualung' depicted on the cover of the Jethro Tull LP. It may be an obscure reference, but I insisted it remain. He is secure enough in his talent, to allow the other actor's, mainly McAdams, Ben Affleck and Robin Wright Penn to, on occasion, talk down to his character while he painfully winces, almost in acknowledgment. Lesser actors would never allow this to make the final script. It's another reason why Crowe is among the very best.Affleck gives a strong portrayal of a Congressman who gets caught up in the scandals that can easily be lifted from the headlines of many a Washington Post morning edition. The reminder that the plot is plausible makes a statement unto itself. Robin Wright Penn is effective as Affleck's weary wife. While her part was more complex than most involving 'the wife', it could have been a bit healthier.Rounding out the cast is a nice mix of talent. Jason Bateman in a superbly played role as a source in the investigation, Jeff Daniels, as the Congressional majority whip, Michael Berresse as the loner ex-soldier , Harry Lennex, great as usual, this time as the vexed police detective. Josh Mostel and Michael Weston also deliver nice chemistry as Crowe's in the field tech specialists.I also liked the appearance of Sarah Lord as 'Mandi Brokaw', the street hustling addict who has a break to offer Crowe in his investigation. She speaks volumes in her initial non-verbal scene, with her expression. Her style is intriguing, and I'd enjoy seeing her in a larger role, perhaps in the future.The newspaper industry may be the last sign of an era that is phasing out. Papers are ubiquitous. They occupy a place on every corner of every major city in the world. Sadly, this is ending. But not before being documented in solid movies like this. Make sure to watch the end credits, as it takes a final look at the process of putting out a newspaper edition. 'State of Play' is one of the movies that will be remembered, in part, for portraying a much-loved industry.The disc was viewed on a highly rated brand name, 40"", 120Hz, 1080P set.

Why kill the aide? Why not just fire her? If, as Ben Affleck says, the killer was only meant to follow and not kill, why didn't Ben call him off after her death? Instead, at the end we have the killer calling Ben to say he will finish the job, ie. kill the reporter.2. If the young druggie had ALREADY stolen the killer's briefcase (as his girlfriend tells reporter (when she hands him the photos and bullets) why is the opening scene of him snatching this case, being chased by killer and killed? The kid must have taken it previously, else how could girlfriend have the stuff inside? Also, if the con was to steal a briefcase then sell it back to owner (as girlfriend states) why did they take the photos OUT of the case? Surely this guy wasn't going to pay for an empty case! If the idea was to blackmail him for more money before turning over contents, that won't play because the girlfriend claimed kid was desperate for a fix. Hence, quick bucks.3. So who is Ben Affleck really? A good guy who loves his friend (remember all the ""you were my best friend boo-hoo"" stuff?)and never meant to harm his aide -- or a ruthless poser who murders the aide and sends an assassin to murder his friend? 4. What is the role of the whip fellow? He's in with the baddies? Ben must know this after he learns aide is a spy, but Ben still brown-noses him in hallway later. OK - politics is politics.5.

193,donaldking,entertaining but derivative political thriller,6,14 April 2011,"An entertaining enough way of spending a couple of hours, but hardly very original. Some of the characters and plot lines are pretty dreadful, and nothing is said here that wasn't said (and said much better) in the great political thrillers of the Seventies: 'All The President's Men,' 'Three Days Of The Condor,' 'The Parallax View'... There are some interesting twists at the end, but most of the film is predictable enough.The usual boxes of liberal paranoia-cum-urban myth are dutifully ticked: the hypocritical 'Christian' congressman, the conspiratorial private security firms that aim to take over the USA, and (mentioned quickly without anyone daring doubt it) the black helicopters that hovered over New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina, taking potshots at 'African-Americans.' Things were never so clear-cut in 'Condor' or 'Parallax' - nor in real life outside 'liberal' Hollywood. The power of the press (and it really IS the press rather than Wikileaks here) is reassuringly the victor over those Republican sons of bitches on Capitol Hill. They ARE Republicans, of course, in 'State Of Play,' even though they're politely not named as such. At the end of 'Condor' Robert Redford is all ready to take 'the truth' to the 'New York Times,' but Cliff Robertson pointedly asks him,'Will anyone read it?' The bad things are Russell Crowe - he fails to convince as a 21st century hybrid of Carl Bernstein and Cal McCrystal. He mumbles and mutters like he usually does, and his long hippy-style hair is irritating. The 'Bob Woodward' bit is replaced by a young female journalist whose job is to run the blogs of the 'Washington Globe.' Helen Mirren spouts clichés as British editor of the 'Globe' - she's getting it in the neck from the paper's new 'corporate owners.' Ben Affleck is a bit better (but not much) as the heroic (or is it anti-heroic?) Congressman determined to expose the activities of 'Pointcorp.' His relationships with his wife and his researcher both fail to convince. Jeff Daniels is good as Affleck's fellow Congressman, but is wasted on just a few lines. His confrontation with Crowe towards the end of the film is well done.For me, the best thing in the film was Jason Bateman (yep, Jason Bateman!) as a sleazy PR agent who has been drawn into the conspiracy through pure greed. When taken to a motel by Crowe to spill the beans, he pops pills, demands beer, and sneers at the cheap decor in the room. He stretches out on the bed, jumps up, and declares, 'That bed is a disgrace' - almost like Larry Grayson running his fingertip over the top of Dennis Plowright's piano and announcing, 'Look at the muck on here.' 'State Of Play' takes itself far too seriously, and I've heard all of it (or most of it) before. The evil-doers are dutifully exposed in the 'Washington Globe,' and the man most directly responsible shot dead by the police. In 'real life,' this 'end' would simply lead to another flurry of conspiracy theories - in the Globe's blogs if not on its front page. I think Paul Schrader's sadly neglected 'The Walker' gives a much more realistic portrayal of how things are covered up in Washington. Watch 'State Of Play' - and then try 'The Walker.'",State of Play

Ben Affleck plays Representative Stephen Collins, Cal's former college roommate turned hotshot U.S. congressman. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, an upstart, young news blogger with a passion for politics. When one of Stephen's employees dies mysteriously (and violently), these three people converge in a taut, cat-and-mouse mystery that exposes both the brutality of politics and the viciousness of news media. When effectively combined on-screen, these two worlds, simultaneously in conflict with and dependent on each other, make for superb subject material.

But all the other 14 movies are documentaries (TV's, short videos). But the none-documentary movies are documentaries in some kinda ways and its not bad. Somewhat entertaining movies and yet eminently State of Play is worth a look. Just do not expect that good a time.",State of Play
197,kevingoodwin,"Pale, Pale Imitation",5,28 May 2009,"For those who saw the original BBC UK TV "" State of Play "" you will wonder how they could have made such a listless 2d version of a great plot line. Afleck is very good the best I've seen him act for years. Crowe is well, ordinary, his character, a grumpy, scruffy, almost unhygienic journalist is very one pace. The newspapers editor played by Helen Mirren is likewise played on one note , that of your tough mainly shouting Brit . The female sidekick of Crowes' is a token role inserted to try to involve the female viewer I guess , which is a shame as she wastes screen time which didn't allow what should have been the main female lead i.e. the wronged politicians wife to shine thru' as it did in the BBC version. In this adaptation her part was by passed with hints to an affair with Crowe, an unhappy marriage etc but absolutely nothing was fleshed out , so you cared little for her situation in all of this murder and intrigue. The at times slack pace of the movie was proved to me as the director constantly intercut scenes with those of a mysterious helicopter scanning the skies of Washington , a very amateur attempt at trying to create tension which isn't necessary in a truly thrilling movie and wasn't needed in the original The two glaring no-nos though were in plot lines which to me showed either lazy scriptwriting or masses of footage on the cutting room floor . In the hospital scene , where the female reporter bumps into the killer on the third floor as she emerges from the elevator. She proceeds to walk a few paces into the treatment room , within seconds a snipers rifle kills the would be witness. Now hang on , the same guy she has just passed has within ten paces of her walking, he has descended three floors, left the hospital , crossed the street , gone into another building, ascended at least four floors into a convenient room and fired his weapon to kill the guy , mmmmm OK suspend disbelief ( and time)But then towards the climax of the whole two hours plus, Crowe suddenly realises the true nature of events and without speaking , crosses Washington to confront Afleck . As he leaves him amazingly this same killer is waiting for Crowe outside Afleck's office !!. So now the killer is a clairvoyant as well as moves at super speed . This makes no sense and unfortunately my suspension was now too tired to shift my disbelief . Sloppy , sloppy plot .After transatlantic copies like this you can understand why film fans groan when they hear Hollywood is to make their version of a loved play/film. My advice , either get the original and enjoy the real thing or don't get the original , see this copy and miss a great tale, well told, your choice .",State of Play

199,blahblahblah12345,The Ideal Thriller,10,18 April 2009,"So I gave this movie a 10, but that's coming from a thriller fan. With most thrillers, this movie has it's faults. Some exaggeration, implausibilities, annoying twists, but the film transcends other thrillers on all other levels. Even with the overly dramatic plot and scenarios, I felt this film was a very realistic portrayal of journalism and posed an interesting argument between old fashioned print journalism and the new age of the internet. Of course, for the ""thrills"" they'll have to make some cliché twists, but it goes beyond the generic nonsense thriller to making a mild statement about the media today. In addition, the cast was fantastic. I couldn't be more relieved that Russell Crowe took over Brad Pitt's role, Pitt would have been a terrible choice. Russell was a much better fit for Cal. However, I kind of wish Edward Norton remained with the role of Senator Collins... Affleck and Crowe didn't have the greatest chemistry. However the many supporting players were fantastic. Rachel McAdams did a fine job. Not exactly the meatiest role but she played the revised role of Della as a young popular blogger greatly. Rachel brought that playful naivety but at the same time made Della intelligent and respectable. Helen Mirren was perfect, and perhaps a little underused. There is also a plethora of strong performances from the minor supporting players. Jason Bateman gave my favorite performance out of all of them, Harry Lennix was another who was underutilized, and Robin Wright Penn continues her reputation as one of the most consistent supporting actresses.But as a thriller, it really was a fantastic and entertaining movie. I've never seen the BBC series and could only imagine how much better it could be with more time to develop characters and stories, but the film does the best it could and that's enough. It isn't your typical mindless thriller though, which is what I respect about it most. It is paced well but if you don't pay attention you may get lost, but seeing as the film really does keep you on your toes, it shouldn't be that hard. What makes this thriller so much better though is that it makes you think, even after leaving the theater. It isn't just some formulaic story with mindless twists and turns, it's actually saying something about the world today that is very relevant, which not only makes a great thriller, but a great film as well.I've read some complaints about the ending, but I don't understand what the big deal was. I don't want to give anything away, but I think it's an ending that could be taken in different ways depending on the viewer.",State of Play

That being said, it is somewhat plain and doesn't have anything special to set itself apart from other thrillers. The acting was well done for the most part, but some elements of the story didn't line up (16 y/o junkie tracks down reporter working on a story he hasn't published anything for yet?)

This is one of those films. The plot is complicated beyond belief and stretches credulity to the breaking point shortly into the film. The behavior of the characters is predictable. The screenwriters of this film would have done well to first have watched ""All The President's Men"" before submitting this screenplay. Sometimes less is more. All the acting in the film is second rate. The one (and bright) exception is Rachel McAdams, who plays the feisty cub reporter Della Frye. She is a bright light and one to watch for future performances.",State of Play
204,sayloroct,Liked The Movie Better,8,29 May 2012,"State of Play is a good thriller that cleverly (whether intentionally or not) plays on a very strong view expectation. Everyone who goes to the movies knows that Hollywood always despises big business and usually despises the military and generally makes them the villain. When there is a murder and a big corporation is featured in the movie, the audience it automatically going make the connection. This makes the surprise ending quite effective because they are not behind the murders after all. The audience it genuinely surprised, and that doesn't happen too often.I am likely in the minority who prefer this movie to the original miniseries. The BBC version was far too complicated, had far too many plot lines and far too many characters, even for 5-6 hours of running time. The movie running at 2 hours time simplified the plot, and eliminated unnecessary characters and scenes. Scenes of many secondary characters like the Collins's secretary, the policemen, most of newspaper staffers, Foy, and Baker's roommate are reduced or eliminated with no loss at all. Eliminating the romance with Collins's wife was a good move, as it wasn't the slightest bit believable in the series. Neither was the plot twist of having the government know that Sonja Baker was a spy, right from the start. The movie wisely eliminated this as well. I missed Bill Nighy, but Russell Crowe was a big improvement over John Simm.Perhaps most importantly, the BBC series blundered badly by killing off the hit-man in the middle of the series. He was the main source of tension and the key to the suspense. The movie wisely keeps him in play until the very end. This gives the movie a big edge overall.",State of Play

206,amarcordforever,A Pleasant Throw Back to Early Pressburger/Powell Espionage and a Pakula Classic,8,16 April 2009,"Whether you loved em' or hated em', espionage thrillers made up a generous portion of cinema from the 1940-50's. With fast paced, edge of your seat story lines, plot twists, political undertones and dramatic personal struggles with morality, nobody did it better than Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. Their attention to character detail and it's purpose in conjunction with the narrative gave heart and humanity to this new string of movies which could have fallen into similar (yet shallower) alpha male characters such as James Bond. Never the less, we cannot forget that ultimately if it weren't for their vision and invention of the genre, Hollywood may have never capitalized on the staggeringly profitable Bond franchise that's still going strong today.In the mid 70's, due to the heat of the political environment at that time, the genre decided to go in the same direction. All The Presidents Men, brought to light the investigative strategies of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and tackled the Watergate scandal from the perspective of the Washington Post. As audiences, we shared in the thrill of being able to follow the case as it unfolded, interviewing witnesses and piecing together clues in order to make a 10 O'clock print deadline. We were part of the chase, the scandal and always privy to the evidence necessary to solve the mystery at hand...that is until a new piece of evidence arose and bashed in all of our original assumptions.State of Play may be the first film to pay homage to this Pakula classic while dually creating more poignant themes for today's political atmosphere. Crowe plays a reporter for the Washington Post and McAdams, an internet blogger, serving as our Woodward and Bernstein clones on the case of a Senator, Affleck, whose mistress succumbs to a rather untimely death VIA train tracks. To add insult to injury, it turns out that our reporter and senator are practically best friends. The plot unfolds, relationships falter and the real truth, to our pleasant surprise, blindsides us like a drunk driver on a narrow road.Director Kevin Macdonald clearly knows what he's doing here and along with a well written screenplay by Tony Gilroy, carefully crafts a neat, sharp and extremely entertaining thrill ride of a movie whose run time is 2 hours and 15 minutes, but feels like 30. State of Play never fails at keeping you guessing, does a fine job of throwing in a few curve balls, and leaves you with a clean taste in your mouth come end credits. What more do you want? Sure. It isn't the next Best Picture and Crowe won't take home an Oscar, but you'll enjoy some nail biting action scenes and there are much worse things to look at than Rachel McAdams on the big screen for a few hours.Helen Mirren is delightful in what little screen time she is given. Affleck is ""good"", although decided to play it completely safe in a role that even he really can't screw up. Lets face it, he needed to gain even a small amount of points since Hollywoodland and the flops that followed in his footsteps.Overall, you'll be as pleased and refreshed as I was to see a picture that has the finesse of an espionage thriller, the entertainment value of an All The Presidents Men political drama and the edginess that we should expect from a modern day piece of cinema that doesn't star Miley Cyrus.",State of Play
207,tempestnam,Definitely a mystery worth finding out...,9,4 September 2009,"I really liked this movie. I haven't seen a good conspiracy, political thriller in a while. This is up there with movies like ""The Pelican Brief"" ""L.A. Confidential"" in the political thriller realms.I thought Helen Mirren gave one of her best performance on film that I can recall. As much as I think Ben Affleck can be a raging tool, his acting was also very good. The entire cast was well acted. And I think the director understood how important acting was to carry the story lines thru this film.Yes, there is suspense, yes there is some action, but any good mystery requires actors who make you believe in the mystery.My only criticism is the ending flipped some new twists out of no where about 3 times. It was good, but you had a feeling of ""Oh, we found out the mystery..."" And then...""Oh, that's the mystery...."" and then...""Oh I finally get it."" And the final ending doesn't really provide resolution of if the got Pointcorp, or if it fell apart because of the story on the Senator. Why did the Senator get arrested? You have to draw the conclusion he was ordering the containment??? But it seems like he just didn't know the guy would do what he did.I appreciated all the conflicts in the film too. There was the conflict of an aging paper and the internet, an old reporter and a new young gun, what takes precedence in news? Thrills, or real earnest reporting. What's moral? Just getting the story, or maintaining a friendship.So there's a lot more to this film than just the mystery itself. I wish more films developed characters this way. They seem to focus so much on trying to show us the story at the cost of maybe exploring these other directions.",State of Play
208,TADKALABS,"An interesting, Nose for News Thriller!",8,15 May 2020,"Washington Globe is a news paper of repute (in the plot) headed by an uptight Helen Mirren at the helm. Russel Crowe (who filled in after Brad Pitt said NO to this role, God knows why) is a middle aged, broodish and old school investigative Journalist/Correspondent who keeps crossing swords now and then with Helen who is under pressure to change the serious outlook which the paper has and go for the Gossip by its new management. Rachel McAdams (for once she has tried putting in serious acting here apart from her oft romantic role casting to suit her famed dimples) is the Desk Manager/Journo of the online version of this paper which is full of gossip coverage. Ben Affleck is a suave Congressman who also happens to be class mate and good friend of Protagonist Russel is another character in whose political career some upheavals happen and paves the way for the caper to chug along. The excreta hits the ceiling when his assistant gets murdered and the team of Russel & Rachel join hands, smells rat & tries to get to the bottom of intricate and complex conundrum of Corporate and Political Espionage and misuse of congressional aid funds meant for defence contracts.
The movie passes off as a decent thriller, keeps you hooked to your seats till the end, thanks to brilliant performances by Russel Crowe and Ben Affleck, ably supported by Helen Mirren & Rachel McAdams. So it is a good political thriller genre movie with suspense, action, drama & story line. The Director Kevin McDonald has done a good job reducing this 6-part (6 hours) BBC series of same name in about 2 hours, while keeping intact the eye for all the details. Camera work is good and slick. Editing it neat, and the idea of shooting some parts of movie inside the Watergate building add that aura of notoriety subtly for a Thriller!
Sublime acting by Crowe with his disheveled longish hair adds the touch of reality to his role pretty aptly. Overall, it is definitely a decent watch without an iota of doubt. And Rachel walks that extra mile to make her role as realistic as possible and somewhat succeeds. Do watch it if you are a sucker for Noir Politico Thrillers!",State of Play
209,Mick-Jordan,Very watchable - holds the interest,6,17 July 2009,"Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is a crusading politician who is trying to prosecute a private military company which he believes plans to take over the country's defense forces. When his secretary is killed in a Subway accident and he breaks down on hearing the news it becomes clear that he was having an affair with her and a scandal breaks loose. Collins' old college pal Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe),a reporter with the Washington Globe suspects a smear campaign and believes that the girl was murdered. He sets out to investigate with young rookie Della Frye (Rachel McAdam) at his side urged on by Helen Mirren's litany of Queen's English swear words. State of Play is a brisk entertaining film that passes the time easily enough. There's not a lot of tension or suspense to be had and the final twist feels very tagged on (and completely unnecessary) but the pacing never flags and the film is never less than interesting. It's helped a great deal by the excellent cast who manage to overcome some pretty dodgy clichés in their characters. Russell Crowe's first appearance shows him every inch the scruffy movie reporter. He drives a beaten up old car listening to old Irish rebel songs on his radio and throwing an empty peanut bag onto the growing pile on his back-seat. – It's a wonder he doesn't smoke. Helen Mirren meanwhile is the typical hard-bitten, tough as nails editor – a woman who tells it like it is, even when it isn't. Almost every line of hers is cringe-worthy right up to ""I can't protect you anymore, you're on your own"" yet she makes it work and you get on with the plot. Rachel McAdam is excellent too and more than holds her own in her scenes with Crowe. – One recommendation that this film has going for it is that it has made me curious to see the original BBC series on which it was based – so much so that I've ordered the DVD.",State of Play

The sad truth that the film glosses over is that the truly corrupt part of the story would be swept under the rug. (Partially seen in the final headlines and their relative size.) So that is something for which all the people involved in this film should be congratulated. Only negative comment would be directing was not good. Too many close ups, no sense of visual poetry. (Makes me frustrated when other worthy directors -- Jill Sprecher, etc. -- do not get big budget films like this). Seemed like a directing/DP attempt at a ""type"" of movie, rather than organically being it -- the tricks of camera work without intent or reason. Actors very good, so casting was well done.

If mega corporations tied intimately to government are to be feared, then perhaps a large media corporation should stop making fake movies about ""exposing"" the criminality of these corporations. There might be a huge conflict of interest that the corporation cannot see but the audience certainly can.At least they should stick to original rotten scripts instead of bastardizing decent British productions. As a 6 hour BBC production, doing the watching via rental DVD was a chore but it was head and shoulders above the cutesy U.S. version where the BAD corporation is mentioned vaguely and the Congressional whip implicated also vaguely and then all is forgiven them in the interest of corporate comity.And that performance by Rachel McAdams was the most wooden performance since the last movie about Noah's arc.

I also entered the theater with a degree of apprehension about how well this feature length film would measure up to the brilliantly acted and crafted six-part BBC series that was the basis for the film. Crowe well-embodied the tenacious old-school investigative journalist that we've come to know from classics, such as ""All the President's Men."" However, the multifaceted ensemble of journalists, portrayed by a rich range of actors from the BBC series (John Simm, Kelly MacDonald, James McAvoy), is missing from this feature film where Russell Crowe does all the work. The complexity of the plot, which includes the competing professional interests and emotional needs of the characters in the British miniseries, is largely eliminated in this big screen version. Ben Affleck and Robin Wright Penn do not seem to appreciate and respond to the high stakes events that could turn their lives inside out and upside down. What this film shares with the miniseries is the glimpse into the mechanics of running a journalistic investigation under the pressure of time and editorial interference, but the personal stories suffer from not being fleshed out and made to feel real and compelling to watch. It is not fair to compare one piece of art to another, but when two productions are related, and you've seen the original, it is difficult to view the second production without prejudice. It is like trying to unring a bell.The new film, State of Play, is a convincing thriller, but it fails to also deliver as a richly defined character drama.Curiosity will drive those who saw the BBC series to see this film, and the rich pedigree of the film production will draw in those who know nothing about the original miniseries. Everyone will ultimately be satisfied by seeing both productions (miniseries is on DVD) so that they can make the comparisons and connections that any thinking film-goer will want to do.",State of Play

220,grdontom,Thrilling.,8,27 July 2009,"Back in 2003 the BBC played host to one of the few drama series which could hold my attention as a thirteen year old. To say I was a twitchy, instant gratification type of viewer would have been something of an understatement, but there was something about it which really took my fancy. With his taken into account, I chose to enter into the cinema to watch the Hollywood remake with suitably low expectations, but high hopes.On the surface this is a simple political thriller. Russell ""Maximus"" Crowe plays Cal McCaffrey, a very old fashioned journalist with a chip on his shoulder and a mouth so smart it makes Obama look like a street urchin. The story unravels at a pace, with very little time to digest what is a complex plot. Unlike many recent Hollywood interpretations of past material, State of Play stays relatively close to the source material, but this leads to my major gripe with the movie. The original series unfolded over roughly 6 hours and to cram that much content into a feature length film is not a wise move. This is what leads to the relentless pace despite being a hefty two and a quarter hours, and those who didn't witness the original may struggle to keep up.Luckily director Kevin Macdonald of ""The Last King of Scotland"" fame with back up the stellar cast manages to craft a very convincing thriller. From the initial ""accident"" to an ending as tense as any you are likely to see this year, everything has a believable progression and you really could imagine the plot occurring in modern politics. One particular highlight is the score. Composed by Alex Heffes who provided the music for the ""Touching the Void"" documentary, the music helps keep the pace of the film at its optimum and also provides a gripping backdrop to the scenes which provide the revelations. In particular watch out for the scene in the underground car park, which is up there with many of the standout scenes of the last few years.As I have already mentioned, the cast is superb. Ben Affleck continues to progress as a top tier actor after a few recent flops, and Rachel McAdams makes a decent if safe debut in a more serious blockbuster. Oscar winning Helen Mirren manages to keep her class despite playing a fairly detestable lead editor and the chemistry between the actors rarely drops below the sublime.Overall, this is an extremely convincing package. Rarely has an interpretation of a TV series been such a complete film, the gelling of drama and thriller hasn't been this effective since Gary Fleders ""Runaway Jury"", and ""State of Play"" far surpasses it. Although not as accessible as the original TV series, or many of the other blockbusters to hit cinemas in the upcoming months, this is certainly a film which will make any trip to the cinema well worth while.",State of Play
221,shootingstarpictures,Please read only if you have seen the movie,4,6 June 2009,"I saw this movie last night. I always have a huge expectation when it comes to a Studio with an enormous budget and a ton of name actors.This movie seemed like it was in a desperate need of a script rewrite. I don't know how many people influence the outcome of a movie like this. I don't know if an executive producer insists on changing scenes, or an actor throws a temper tantrum if a certain shot is not added or deleted, or simply the director is not doing a good job. Let's say that this was all hands off, and like what one would expect, was all on the director and the script writer(s), so no excuses.The idea behind the script is great, let's get the bad, powerful, No Bid Contract, blood sucking war mercenaries. But, in a movie, generally, good guys are good guys and bad guys are bad guys. Yes, granted, good guys do make mistakes, and bad guys, some times do get to pet an animal or two. But the good guys seldom kill the innocent, and bad guys never just walk away.There are parts that don't make sense, like the escape of a long haired, laid back, yet inquisitive journalist from the foot chase of a highly military trained, mercenary, killing machine. Or the same highly trained, killing machine putting on his fatigues and acting completely out of character. The highlight of the movie is the performance of one my favorite actors, Jason Bateman. There are so many lowlights that I don't know where to begin with, but one of the very laughable lines was said by Russell Crowe's character to Ben Affleck's character (please forgive me, I am paraphrasing, and this is not word by word): ""at the end, four people got killed, and for God's sake, one of them was a Pizza Delivery man.."", I almost fell out of my seat, who writes this stuff!

And just when it all seems to be nicely sewn up, the final few minutes bring yet another twist to deny the cosy ending that looked to be on the way.I was lucky enough to see a free preview of this film prior to its release in the UK, but I'd have no hesitation to recommend it to anyone looking for a couple of diverting hours.",State of Play
224,tuppen2010,"Not a disaster, but a big disappointment",4,22 April 2009,"One of those endeavours that makes you wonder ""why""? The Paul Abbott-scripted, 6 hour BBC production from 1993 was stand out TV. This is a run of the mill thriller, with way, WAY too much plot shoehorned into 2 hours. We all know the problems that the producers had when Brad Pitt abandoned the production at the 11th hour (I suspect he'd just read the script). A relief to some, perhaps, but his replacement, Russell Crowe, is irksome in the extreme. Yet again he gives one of those furrowed-browed performances (this time aided by about 50lbs of spare flab and a mane of hair that looks as if it's auditioning for a shampoo advert) that he clearly thinks implies complexity and internal struggle. But not even he can be wholly blamed for the indigestible ending that tries to convince us that he's some kind of morally superior being. The writers didn't bother the write a character for poor Rachel McAdams, and she doesn't have the star quality to overcome this. I've no idea whether or not Ben Affleck was any good as whenever he was on screen I was trying to decide whether or not he was wearing a wig. Helen Mirren appears to phone in her performance as a grizzled, world-weary editor. She, and the screenwriters, appear to think that she's reprising her role as Jane Tennyson in Prime Suspect.Despite these significant problems, director Macdonald turns in some good thriller moments. Nothing to raise it above the average, but plenty of scenes rack up the tension more than adequately. Do yourself a favour- in the UK you can currently buy the BBC original for £3.95 on Amazon. Half the price as a cinema ticket; 3 times the film for your money and about 10 times as good.",State of Play
225,spicopate,"Don't watch the movie, go watch the 2003 BBC miniseries",2,6 January 2013,"So State of Play is a movie, a remake from State Of Play, a miniseries (6 episodes of 1 hour) that aired in 2003 on the BBC (UK). As the movie is a remake, I will state the differences and why this movie is so bad, compared with the original. Main reason : the cast. Here, in the movie,you have Russel Crowe (playing Cal MacCaffrey - established journalist), big movie star with long hair that could be an add for a shampoo as a reviewer already said. You also have Ben Affleck (Stephen Collins), Cutie actor who is as credible as a politician as a tomato trying to look like a green bean. Another Cutie as a woman this time (playing Della Frye, a newbie journalist), the ""Girl who has no use in the movie but looks good and that's enough"". And the only good actress with an interesting role plays the Editor. And that's all. The whole movie rests on 4 actors. In the BBC miniseries, between the great John Simm (MacCaffrey, has played the Master on DrWho), David Morissey (Stephen Collins, playing in The Walking Dead), James Mc Avoy, Bill Nighy, Kelly McDonald (Della an accomplished journalist, see the difference with the movie?, now playing in the Boardwalk Empire), Polly Walker and so on... See what I mean ? The miniseries is an ensemble cast series, and that's what makes its greatness. As for dummy things in the movie : at the end, Russel Crowe (scuse me, Cal MacCaffrey) sits at his desk and writes his 10 pages article in two hours. I didn't know being a journalist was so easy ! In comparison, in the miniseries, Cal Mac Caffrey (John Simm) changes only the title of his article ... The movie was all about Russel and his hair, Ben and his good look, The Girl and her I don't know what. The miniseries was all about the characters and their depth, the well crafted story, the authenticity of its not world known actresses and actors... I know what I prefer.",State of Play
226,andypoek,Good Poltical Mystery,7,24 January 2011,"""State of Play"", an Americanized version of the hit BBC miniseries, may feel like familiar ground for fans of ""All the President's Men"", ""Three Days of the Condor"", and other thrillers set within the corridors of power, and Kevin Macdonald (the inventive director of ""The Last King of Scotland"") intentionally homaged ""President's Men"" frequently in the film (as both films involved conspiracy, investigative reporters and city newspapers). The references certainly don't hurt the film, although I wish he'd captured the mounting suspense as effectively! While well-crafted, ""State of Play"" never achieves 'edge-of-your-seat' tension, despite a first-rate cast, and clever script.When a rising politician (Ben Affleck), heading a Senate subcommitte investigating a shady military subcontractor, discovers his mistress has died, he loses his composure in front of a national TV audience, and his political future is endangered. Was it an accident, a suicide...or murder? He asks his ex-college roommate, veteran reporter Russell Crowe (who looks about a decade older than Affleck!), to look into it. Hounded by young, up-and-coming reporter Rachel McAdams, Crowe half-heartedly begins to investigate the death...and a much, much larger plot emerges, involving the corporation under investigation, the Senate Majority Leader (Jeff Daniels), possibly Affleck's unhappy wife (and ex-Crowe girlfriend), Robin Wright Penn, and even Affleck, himself. While Crowe's exasperated editor (Helen Mirren) fights him, demanding to go to press with what he has, Crowe refuses to stop, until he knows the truth...making him a target...Washington, D.C. has never been seen to better advantage, and the press room is so accurate, it's difficult to believe it's actually a movie set. Russell Crowe is magnificent, certainly giving the best performance of the film (Affleck, McAdams, and Mirren are also very good). The climactic plot twist, while not entirely a surprise, is satisfying...but without the 'mounting suspense' element, there are moments when the story drags a bit. Still, ""State of Play"" is very good, and worth watching!",State of Play

The story itself was intriguing enough, although as the movie progressed and the pieces of the conspiracy are being put together, the movie made less and less sense, till at the end where it made no sense. It's very disappointing in this regard. However, the acting and directing are great and if you can put up with an unsatisfying conclusion and a story with holes in it, then you'll be very entertained indeed.On a side note, I was impressed that the story didn't have (consipicuously) a romantic subplot.

Crowe plays his role as a grubby, untidy but idealistic investigative journalist with ease and Mirren was also an perfect fit as the cantankerous editor, although a lot of the time she just seemed to stand around and curse. Putting these three key actors together with an thought-provoking plot and some controversial arms dealing issues, resulted in an first-rate evening's entertainment.

I still recommend it highly as it does move and is a good mystery, albeit a bit convoluted. You cannot ask for a better cast; although, I am not much of a fan of Ben Affleck. Without this star-packed cast, the film would have been somewhat ordinary. I vaguely recollect seeing portions of the BBC series; but had not seen the ending.

Russel Crowe may have had bad hair, but he is such an amazing and believable actor, and Affleck is like a cardboard cutout (with moveable jaw)against Crowes stellar talents. I cannot believe even a smidgen of Crowe's magic did not rub off on Affleck! No wonder he (Affleck) recently contributed to an article in my woman's mag!!!!Jeff Daniels is amazing in his portrayal of an eerie congressman. When is this guy gonna get his due? He is so convincing....and should have been revealed as the mastermind behind the conspiracy! It would have been so much more rewarding to see more of Daniels! Helen Mirren's character did not do her justice. She was supposed to be a ball buster, but it was like she was playing it as a harassed weakling who would collapse, crying at any moment. I wanted her to just give it to Crowe's character, but all she kept doing was caving. It was laughable when Crowe is trying to explain, scene after scene, that there was a conspiracy to kill Sonja. A supposed tough as nails head of the Washington Post cannot see the fact that a person investigating a major military conspiracy might be offed? They all laugh at Crowe, and they are all journalists...uh, aren't they supposed to be uncovering conspiracies at all times? No, Crowe is just being ""crazy"" again! Bateman was so much better than Affleck. Y not try him in Affleck's part? I found myself sympathizing with Bateman's character and feeling his pain bcuz of Bateman's true emotion. Rachel Mac Adams is useless, just smiling and looking chipper. Robin Wright Penn-she had a dead end role, and why did her hair look like a sort-of super long mullet? Not the type of styling of a congressman's wife in DC!! She was just a distraction in this film because the storyline with her was superfluous and never went anywhere. One of the best scenes I have seen is in this film. That is the stalking of Crowe in the parking garage by the assassin. The guy who played the assassin was amazing, (Michael Berresse)and if they just would have used him against Crowe in a simple ""kill or be killed"" plot, this would have been fantastic. Berresse is not even speaking, he is just walking, and the way he moves his body/hands is scary and so effective. They wasted his talents when, in the end he is filmed getting dressed geekishly and then dies quickly. He did not start out as a geek, he was truly frightening at the start! One more point is...why the heck was everyone sitting around so casually in the end? At the ""Washington Globe"" they all sit in front of huge glass windows chewing the fat, Crowe and Mac Adams sit around drinking whiskey...um... if they are supposed to be ""bringing down the nations power structures"" and everyone involved is getting killed, shouldn't they be hiding out somewhere or at least acting a little concerned???? (remember being stalked by the assassin, Russel?)What a clunker...but I will be faithful to Crowe, Mirren, Daniels, Bateman, and the killer Michael Berresse...I want to see him become a major star!!",State of Play

233,howardevans-310-713991,Good thriler - russell is fantastic,7,10 March 2012,"The twisty and engaging screenplay is credited to three scribes: Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray. But it's Gilroy's fingerprints that shape the story with all the overlapping dialogue and conspiracy talk that will remind many of his ""Michael Clayton"". Adapted from a sprawling BBC miniseries created by Paul Abbott, the trio is especially deft in their condensing of the story into a fully digestible two hours. Even as new characters and twists keep coming, the audience is never left out in the cold. They also give the cast plenty to chew on with some great throw-away lines amidst all the posturing between the cops, reporters, politicians and sleaze-bags.Though it's Crowe and Helen Mirren as his sparring and quick-witted boss who shine the most, this is essentially an ensemble piece, and it's especially clever when Jason Bateman arrives on screen for a few pivotal scenes as a smug public relations guru who's too dumb to realize he knows too much. The cast also includes Robin Wright Penn as Affleck's wife, Jeff Daniels as the arrogant majority whip and Harry Lennix, who as a D.C. detective makes a compelling case here for the lead role in the Barack Obama Story. The only miscalculation in the casting is poor Rachel McAdams, lovely but annoying in her high-pitch as Crowe's blogging tag-along looking to kick it old-school and get something in print.By the third act ""State of Play"" overplays its hand in its attempts to be timely with too much talk of the privatization of the military, Capitol Hill sex scandals and traditional newspapers losing out in the digital age to bloggers more concerned with gossip than real journalism. It could've also been more subtle in its preaching about the importance of serious investigative reporting. It should be commended, however, for an otherwise smart screenplay that doesn't spell out all its twists and turns too early and the well polished cast who give the film a slick sheen. Even though it might be reporting on yesterday's news, ""State of Play"" still makes for solid rainy day entertainment and is worthy of blogging about.",State of Play
234,isakregal,Revival of the detective film.,8,27 July 2012,"Review for State of Play (2009).The movie starts with a petty thief who's gunned down in an alley and a Congressman's assistant who supposedly falls in front of a subway - two seemingly unrelated deaths. Now we follow Cal McAffrey (played by Russel Crow) who's this old-school type reporter working for the Washington Globe and is writing a story about these murders and this cub reporter Della Frye (played by Rachel McAdams) who writes columns on the Globe's online site for whom he takes under his wing and together they try to unravel a story that might eventually lead to a big corporate conspiracy.Cal's best friend from college, Steven Collins (played by Ben Affleck) is a congressman and a representative for the Republican party and early in the film we see him break down at a conference when he's announcing the death of Sonia Baker, his assistant. This speculates that he had a romantic relationship with her and becomes an outburst in the media, and the news is suggesting later that night that she may have committed suicide. Steven goes to stay with Cal to escape from all the paparazzi's on his lawn and for the friend and reporter that he is, Cal tries to help Steven by suggesting creating an alternative plausible story that could swing the spot light off Steven, Steven shows Cal a video of Sonia the morning she was killed and in the video she appears joyful and happy and does not indicate any sign of wanting to commit suicide. Cal now makes a connection between the murders of the thief, or drug dealer (and a witness who got shot in the process) and Sonia Baker and he traces this all the way back to Pointcorp; a company that Steven represents the loss of a lot of money for and a possible giant corporate-military conspiracy. Pointcorp is the company that Collins has been digging into the past few years with his assistant, Sonia Baker being his lead researcher on the Pointcorp hearings.Anyway, we follow Cal and some of his co-worker journalists trying desperately to make the deadline that his boss Cameron (played by Helen Mirren) has set him. There's a lot of information floating around all through the entire film touching on topics like national security, big- money military corporations, the patriot act, 9/11, the journalism industry, new police interrogation techniques and etcetera. Jason Bateman appears in the movie as Dominic Foy, a DC public relations figure with known ties to the defense contractor Pointcorp, just the stereotypical PR guy and he is absolutely hysterical, completely steals the show with him only being in it for 10 minutes or so, he's great as the corporate asshole type.I don't want to tell you more or go into details too much here but this being a political thriller it is also a movie that focuses on the last days of the newspaper, because whether the younger generations have noticed or not, almost everything goes through the internet these days especially now with the introduction of Facebook and several other large social networking services. The performances and dialog in this are all top class and this is probably one of the best films that came out that year (2009). The cast is great, it includes: Russel Crow, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Helen Mirren, Jeff Daniels, Robin Wright Penn, Harry Lennix, Jason Bateman and an impressive David Harbour who appears in this film as a former Pointcorp employee, Cal's inside man that helps him get information about Pointcorp's domestic and worldwide business activities in the past few years.Plot: 10/10: A political thriller with a complex story and solid characters. Real life scenarios and a reporter working on a case unraveling a huge corporate conspiracy, the film includes many twists and turns and has you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Performances: 9/10. Very impressive, there's hardly a single weak link in here. Jason Bateman as mentioned earlier manages to make the movie his own in those few scenes he's in and he's an absolute pleasure to watch along with the entire cast, even some of the supportive actors whom I've never seen or heard of before, including those working on Cal's team, writing the story are top drawer.Dialog: 9/10. Witty, funny, clever, self-aware, all around good and delivered very professionally. You never get bored by watching it. It moves fast and there are no cheap in-puts or slapstick jokes in here.Directing: 9/10. Great during the action sequences, drama sequences and pretty much everything that's going on. It's quite different from what you'd see in a modern film with some scenes when people are talking, the movie is showing you something different, other angles or circling around the area where there are other people talking, it all works really well.Editing: 9/10. Pretty artistic, as I said before the film moves in a different way than a lot of the modern thrillers we've seen and they managed very well to make a two hour film out of a 6-show mini series so you've got to give them credit 'cause there is not one scene in this movie where I felt bored. If anything, there needed to be more scenes when the information is in full flow because it did feel slightly rushed at times. The ending is a bit too subjective to even touch on.Another part that I wanted to mention is that Pointcorp; the company which they are investigating is a clear reference to Blackwater the controversial private military company and one of the largest of U.S. State department's three private security contractors.",State of Play

236,emmapeeldallas,State of Play is so very Hollywood...which means it could have been better...,5,19 April 2009,"The plot is thin, and doesn't really hold up under scrutiny, and yet I'd guess lots of people will love this movie. I did not, and my problem goes beyond plot. My problem was with the casting. I love Helen Mirren. She always does a good job, and this film is no exception. I also love Russell Crowe, and as usual, he does alright, given what he has to work with. It's not his fault that his character is a complete caricature of a reporter. Robin Wright Penn also does alright with her role, which is very limited and one-dimensional. And then there's Ben Affleck, who should probably just give up acting altogether. He's exceptionally bad in this movie. But my biggest gripe with this movie is in casting Rachel McAdams as the cub reporter. Why does the cub reporter have to be a beautiful young woman? Russell Crowe has just turned 45 and looks it; it's one of many things I like about him. It's clear that he doesn't work out; he hasn't had his teeth whitened; his character is a slob, with both his desk and his apartment giving ample evidence of his disorganization...and yet he's a good reporter, and a good guy to boot. In other words, HUMAN and BELIEVABLE...so of course Hollywood decided to cast opposite him Rachel McAdams, who could grace the cover of any number of fashion magazines, were she so inclined, and who is 15 years his junior in real life but looks even younger; I didn't get the impression that her character was supposed to be 30. Would it work the other way around? Would George Clooney or Brad Pitt, all gussied up for the cover of GQ, and with an appropriately slick apartment, be believable as a hard hitting investigative reporter? I don't think so, and someone in casting didn't think so either; thus we have Russell Crowe, playing a slob, in the lead. So if the male lead must be gritty, why does Hollywood think the counterpart must be a beautiful, perfectly groomed young woman? I like Rachel McAdams and think she's a competent actress, but she simply wasn't believable in this role. There must be young actresses out there who just look like regular people. Why not cast one of them? For that matter, why does the cub reporter have to be young? Why couldn't she be any age, but new at reporting? This might have been a better film if the cub reporter had been a plain woman of any age trying to find her way working with Crowe and Mirren and their experience. I think that would have made this a much more interesting movie, and it's a movie that might actually be made somewhere, but not in Hollywood.",State of Play

While the evidence is held, people die for it. You have a big company apparently killing people to frustrate the good intentions of good congressmen. You have congressmen attacking the big company to earn prestige, or working with them to earn money.Everybody is playing a game, and winning that game is more important than doing the right thing, consistently. The title ""State of Play"" is a reference to the relationship between the State and all these games being played at the same time.The movie is entertaining as any good thriller.

Went and saw the movie today. I like Russell Crowe but thought his character was a bit flat and unemotional, I guess that's him being a journalist. Funny he loathes them in real life, but there is a line in the movie where he tries to explain they are respectable.Although there are several high profile actors/actresses in this movie I thought the acting was a bit flat (except Jason Bateman, he is a standout providing the only laughs) and stereotypical of the roles they were assigned, which lead to my predictions about the plot early on that turned out somewhat correct. It does leave you guessing a bit until near the end, not very suspenseful though. I would not consider this a full on political thriller compared to Russell's Body of Lies and Proof of Life. None of the roles in this are Oscar worthy either.It irks me when I see a movie that at the final critical moment a character that has been shown with a steady resolve in the movie - becomes unbelievable/cheesy and I find myself saying, ""That would have NOT happened in real life, come on already"". Obviously that happens in this movie, you'll know when you see it. Of course they save it until the end, they have your money now, don't they?The movie is pretty easy to follow, not really a thinking person's movie but a bit messy in set design for a purpose. I like neat and tidy! All the offices are messy with paper everywhere, bit of a distraction through out. Trying to tell you - in this movie paper is required and virtuous!

So what scenario makes the ending plausible? The only one I can think of means that Affleck knew Sonia was in the pay of PointCorp from the gitgo and was colluding with them all along and his investigation was just pure theater. I don't think that's what the screenwriters intended. I think they want us to believe that Affleck was investigating PointCorp in good faith, but got worried when Sonia seemed to be double-dealing and hired Bingham to check her out and Bingham just went psycho on him--but that scenario still doesn't explain how he learned she was getting paid by Pointcorp.

247,mackenziekeys343,"Definitely not as good as the original, but Rachel McAdams keeps this film from sinking",5,25 April 2009,"If you enjoyed the 2009 theatrical version even in the slightest, you would absolutely love the original Bristish television version from 2003. The drama and the characters are much better represented, making it a much better thriller. Rachel McAdams is the better Della, but all of the British Actors play their characters more accurately than the Americans. Though Helen Miren was cast as the editor of the Washington Globe newspaper and as the only Bristish actor in the film, I anticipated a brilliant performance by her. I was disappointed, but at least she shined brighter than Russell Crowe or Ben Affleck. Jason Bateman, despite him being a generally terrific actor in the other roles he's played, does a terrible job playing Dominic Foy. You'll understand what I mean when you see Marc Warren portray the biggest jackass/bisexual wimp ever. I do have to say that the American version stuck to the essential plot line and did a great job with most of the plot twists. Overall, can't live up to the original.",State of Play

I was excited at the possibility of seeing a gem among a category of movies that had become dry and repetitive. Unfortunately, I was nothing but disappointed.I can't conceive of what reviewers found notable or praiseworthy about the film. There was nothing new in the film's plot, nor was the hackneyed material delivered with any special creativity. The cast--(Crowe and Mirren especially)--were wasted on this script.

Sorry - it's stupid, it's demeaning, it's distracting, it's dizzying, it's pointless, and its sole purpose appears to be making up in phoney veritay what it can't deliver in realitay, or is too cowardly to attempt delivering in real dramatic production.Big yawn, couldn't get past 15 minutes due to the vacuum in its head and heart, plus the headache from its visuals.There oughta be a law against the jitter machine that they used to replace a cameraman in this bomb.

251,blahjovic,I wanted to like this movie...,6,15 April 2009,"I attend a screening for this movie last night and was excited to see it because I felt the cast had a lot of potential. I enjoyed Russell Crowe and Rachel McAdams performances. They may well represent the old stalwart reporter V.S the modern internet reporter/blogger. I wanted to give this movie a 7 or 8 half way through but I ended up giving it a 6 for a couple reasons.1 Ben Affleck. It's been 7 or 8 years since I've even enjoyed him in a film. I was really hoping that this would be an opportunity for him to break out of his rut. The more he showed up in this film the more he drug the film down for me. He just doesn't pull off a US Senator and quite frankly i don't know how he still gets parts.2 At first i liked how they played the dying newspaper issue, i think it's a compelling story line and when mixed with a political conspiracy it could be great. I was hoping it would take on the issue like Syriana did with oil and politics. However, as the movie rolled on I started to wonder if the W. Post or the NY Times sponsored the film.Third. I wish we could have seen more of Harry Lennix (Detective). He's an actor that I feel can add quite a bit to a movie and if you read the plot description above you'd think he was a costar.My last issue I can't mention without giving something away.Overall i found this film to be entertaining and on issues moderately compelling. I would recommend it to a friend, but perhaps not on opening weekend.",State of Play

253,edtully,So Many Holes They Should Have Entitled It Swiss Cheese,3,24 March 2013,"Spoiler Alert!! At first blush ""State Of Play"" is an entertaining, well produced film with a strong cast and a juicy story. It's a lot of fun to follow along the twists and turns one expects from an action thriller. That is, until one starts to give any thought to content. It's my opinion that if one is going to go to all the trouble and expense of producing an exciting, action thriller laced with layered conspiracies it should at least be able to stand up to a casual viewing without numerous plot holes and goofs being noticeable.Here are just three: 1) How did the assassin manipulate the young woman into standing right on the edge of the subway loading area which just happened to be one of only three ""blind spots"" in the passenger loading area? If the Metro officials have security cameras monitoring the area why would there be a ""blind spot"" where passengers get on and off the train? 2) A closeup of the Gulf War army buddies group photo is on screen at 37:55 into the movie. The camera cuts away for a few seconds and then the closeup of the photo is back on screen again. When we see it a second time it's glaringly obvious that the photo has been significantly altered from just a few seconds ago. The smiling face of the soldier at the far right (Bingham) has been changed to the unsmiling face of the actor playing the assassin and both his and Affleck's character's face have very obviously been superimposed on the corresponding men in the photo. It's instantly noticeable, so obvious and amateurishly done that I did a double take, immediately paused the DVD, and scrolled back and forth between the two closeups of the photo several times to confirm the significant differences. I'm really surprised that someone didn't catch this glaring error before the movie was released.3) During the scene where Collins ""comes clean"" at the newspaper office, the scene cuts back and forth between the Collins monologue and the assassin Bingham in his room alone solemnly and somewhat ritualistically dressing in his fatigues and assembling his assault rifle much like a matador dressing in preparation for going into the ring. He phones someone (who is he calling?!) with his cell and ominously leaves a message saying, in part, ""I want to assure you that I am ready to finish what we started"". I guess the director is trying to throw one more twist'into the plot by misleading the audience into believing that Bingham, who we have been led to believe has been working for the ""bad corporate mercenary defense contractor"", is preparing to kill Collins. However, after it is revealed in the big, climactic confrontation between ""best friends"" Cal and Collins that Bingham has actually been working for Collins the whole time, one is left with the logical conclusion that Bingham left that message for Collins. After leaving the message, Bingham then destroyed his cell phone. So why is he out on the sidewalk with his assault rifle across the street from Collins office when Cal comes out? Where did the several police officers go who were loitering in front as Collins is shown entering his office building? What was the finishing action Bingham said he intended to accomplish when he left the message for Collins that he was ready to finish what they had started? Bonus) How did a young woman whose only notable job experience was ""waitressing"" become the lead researcher for a congressional committee that was investigating a multi-billion dollar defense contractor? And with that job history how did she get a credit card that would allow her to run up a $40,0000 debt? Oh yeah, if you have an old cell phone you're no longer using and a garbage disposal you don't mind breaking, turn it on and toss that old cell phone into it, taking care to run a little water at the same time as Bingham does. It'll make a lot of racket but it won't destroy the phone. Is this a common practice when people want to get rid of a cell phone? It seems like a 10 second scene showing him removing the battery and SIM card from the phone and throwing the three items into different dumpsters or garbage cans would have made a lot more sense, or just throwing it out the window of his moving car. When was this ""lost grunt"" trained for covert action? Why is he willing to murder 4 strangers?",State of Play
254,jlddvm,If you like thrillers...,9,20 April 2009,"Crowe brings his A game (despite an occasional accent slip) to his role as a world-weary reporter with the newly purchased Washington Globe, helmed by Helen Mirren's very engaging take on Perry White/Katharine Graham. If you like thrillers you won't be disappointed in this pic that runs 2 hours and feels less than half of that. ""State of Play"" isn't perfect and the number of plot points that need to come together veritably dictate some implausibility at the end but if you compare this film to any five suspense-thrillers (at least Hollywood-made) that have come out in the past five years, you have to appreciate the whole package: Acting (and I disagree with the Ben Affleck naysayers here, he acquitted himself very well), character acting (Viola Thomas, Jason Batemen and Harry Lennix compete equally with a fraction of the time of the major players), interesting and gripping plot and story development, and overall believability all make this a first-rate film and one all involved should be proud of. The subtext of love and loss surrounding the non- entertainment print media also lends more than a little credibility and sympathy to the effort. I hope this film succeeds on a financial level and inspires at least one or two ambitious filmmakers to make movies in the same vein. Without doubt, there are too few genre pics of this caliber and State of Play shows it can be done well, even into the 21st century.",State of Play

The guy who was the shooter at the beginning of the movie and turned out to be working for Ben Affleck's character? Who did he call right before he ground up his cell phone and put on his military uniform? Ben Affleck? If he did why would Ben Affleck have been stupid enough to still be in his office to get arrested? What ever happened to the majority Whip of Ben Affleck's party? Why didn't he get arrested? How was Ben Affleck behind everything if this guy helped set him up? That made no sense. Wasn't it awfully convenient for the killer of Ben Affleck's girlfriend and Ben Affleck (or whoever was behind the killing of Ben Affleck's girlfriend in the beginning) that she decided to stand in the ONE BLIND SPOT that the camera's had on the subway platform?

I just cant fault Russell Crowes acting, he is one of my favorite actors anyway, and he brought out his haphazard yet genius journalist character beautifully. Affleck on the other hand made me cringe every time he tried to portray a facial expression more than ""indifferent"". When he was telling the world of Sonia's death in the beginning i felt no emotion or sympathy for the character whatsoever. Putting that poor performance aside though, the plot was fantastic and gripping and didn't just feel like a clichéd story where your average Joe getting involved in a grand scheme. I cant say much for the directing though with much of the movie in the dark, In my opinion overplaying the ""mystery effect"" card a little too much.

But if this genre of film prove financially successful, Hollywood's wealthy will sleep very easily knowing that their children's trust funds, their mortgage payments on their vast mansions, and their yachts and private jets are safe for a few more years, whilst thousands of kids continue to be killed and left limbless in the Middle East.",State of Play

Alas, seeing Ben Affleck gave me pause, because it is hard to recall a film which hasn't been ruined by his presence since the excellent ""Good Will Hunting"". And unfortunately it was the case yet again, but you can't blame just Affleck. The writing was very predictable, and then ""shocking ending you won't see coming""...well, you easily saw it coming. It seemed that everyone in the theater today saw it coming. Also there were more than a few snickers regarding the heroic portrayal of PRINT journalism in this film. It seemed about 5 years out of date on that score. Every day you read about the death of another print newspaper, and much of the hot news and investigative journalism is now done by online sources and blogs. Yet to the producers of this film, they don't seem to even exist. Gives it a dated feel and adds to the boredom of this disappointingly dull ""thriller"".
