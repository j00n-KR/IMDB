0,SnoopyStyle,let the killers lead,5,23 December 2015,"In the late 40s, Raymond Fernandez (Jared Leto) is a hustler who cons rich women. He meets damaged Martha Beck (Salma Hayek). They become the notorious ""Lonely Hearts Killers"" who rob lonely widows using personal ads and then kill them. Robinson (John Travolta) and Hildebrandt (James Gandolfini) are homicide detectives. The killers eventually confess to twelve murders in total.The cast is first rate. There is enough production value. However, writer/director Todd Robinson fails to generate any intensity for me. I think the most compelling characters are Fernandez and Beck. I would have like them to lead. Travolta and Gandolfini are great actors but I'm not fascinated by their characters. Following both sets of characters simply divides the attention of the audience.",Lonely Hearts
1,claudio_carvalho,Lethal Jealousy,7,26 December 2006,"In the late 40's, the swindler Raymond Martinez Fernandez (Jared Leto) seduced lonely women to steal their possessions. When he meets the deranged Martha Beck (Salma Hayek), they fall in love for each other. With the jealous Martha posing as if she were his sister, the crook Ray seduces and kills other women. Two New York Detectives - Elmer C. Robinson (John Travolta) and Charles Hildebrandt (James Gandolfini) - chase the sociopaths, but without having the evidence of a body. In the end of 40's, the couple is arrested and sentenced to death, being electrocuted in March, 1951 in Sing Sing.""Lonely Hearts"" is a simple story based on a true event supported by a great cast and excellent cinematography and costumes. The story of the ""Lonely Hearts Killers"" is violent and a flag for those pro-death penalty sentence. Cold blood killers like Raymond and Martha do not deserve to have a second chance in a society of human beings. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Fugitivos"" (""The Runaways"")",Lonely Hearts
2,kosmasp,Could've been better,6,15 April 2007,"Which is not the fault of the cast. James Gandolfini and S. Caan do have really great moments together (although you would like to see more of them ... especially Gandolfini). Jared Leto and Salma Hayek are great too. The only one I wasn't entirely convinced with was J. Travolta! A stronger lead would have helped enormously, because you don't get to spend so much time with the characters. Subplots do spice up the story, but they're mostly not entirely convincing too. That leaves you with the main plot, which does feel like a crime noir, but it's not as good as it could be. I can't explain that, without going into details and spoiling some of the stuff, so I will leave it at that!",Lonely Hearts
3,classicsoncall,"""Ain't nothin' out here but road and trouble.""",7,28 March 2019,"I have a feeling the real Lonely Hearts Killers were even more maniacal and brutal than the characters portrayed by Jared Leto and Salma Hayek in this picture. The real couple, Raymond Martinez Fernandez and Martha Beck were believed to have killed up to twenty women on their murder spree between 1947 and 1949. In 1949, they committed three murders for which they would be convicted; the only one they were tried for was the murder of Janet Fay, but it was enough to send them to the electric chair.Besides the extortion and murder on display in the picture, the real crime seems to be the casting of Salma Hayek in the role of Martha Beck. OMG, if you pull up an internet photo of Martha Beck, you'll see someone who more closely resembles actress Anne Ramsey, the Momma that Danny DeVito tried to throw from the train in that 1987 movie of the same name. The real Martha probably would have been horrified at the idea of casting Hayek in the role, given she was so demonic with Ray's string of lovers. She would have thought the film makers were mocking her.As a crime story, the picture blows by pretty quickly in so far as the way detectives Elmer 'Buster' Robinson (John Travolta) and partner Charlie Hilderbrandt (James Gandolfini) managed to track down the notorious couple. I didn't really perceive much in the way of clues that the pair put together, especially regarding the Michigan murders of Delphine Downing (Dagmara Dominczyk) and her daughter Rainelle. And this was during the late Forties and early Fifties when the technology available today wasn't even thought of. But most of what was shown in the movie really happened, so I guess you can forgive the details left out.Hanging around through the end credits, I managed to catch the name Travolta more than once, so I looked up the full cast list for this movie. The picture has three siblings of John Travolta in the story, sister Ellen as a woman named Ida, brother Sam as a foreman, and another sister Margaret as a Mineola police dispatcher. Seems to me it would be interesting to see a movie about nepotism in the film industry.",Lonely Hearts
4,ccthemovieman-1,'Ugly' Best Describes This Film,2,5 August 2007,"James Gandolfini has to be one of the most profane actors I've heard in 50 years of watching films. The famous star of ""The Sopranos"" is ridiculous in here. I don't mind the swearing, but not every sentence. This was a shame because I love to see the 1940s portrayed with modern film-making. It just looks great but the above actor, along with John Travolta and several cops, just spoke with dialog ""that would make a sailor blush,"" and a lot of it wasn't necessary. This was verbal equivalent of overdone action, a la films like ""Van Helsing"" or ""300."" It took away from the interesting real-life story of the ""Lonely Hearts Killers,"" a couple who really existed. However, this movie really focuses more on Travolta's character than the serial murders. That might have been because the director of the movie was related to the cop in some way.Selma Hayek offers sultry looks and a sexy body, playing the femme fatale, but she's no great actress and her voice leaves a lot to be desired. By the way, in real life, the character she played was a fat, ugly woman. So much for realism. Her partner in crime is played by the slimy-looking Jared Leto, who plays his normal scumbag character. However, I didn't find much chemistry with these actors. The period-piece look was nice but the actors and curious script just didn't add make this as good a story as compelling as it should have been.You know, with a classier script, this could have been a fine movie...but it was ugly and another bomb at the box office. People generally don't flock to the theaters to see a film filled with these kind of hard-edged characters. Hollywood just doesn't get it, or doesn't care. In fact, it promotes this sort of thing (i.e. ""The Departed""), even if they lose money. That's how sick the film industry finds itself.",Lonely Hearts
5,rmax304823,People You Don't Want to Meet.,6,21 December 2008,"This is a re-telling of the story featured in Kastle's earlier and inexpensive black-and-white film. Martha Beck (Salma Hayek) and Ray Fernandez (Jared Leto) are two lovers who live in the own version of Cloud Cuckooo Land, traveling about the country in 1947, meeting lonely widows through ads in Lonely Hearts tabloids, then emptying their bank accounts and sometimes disposing of the inconvenient women and, in one case, a child who is a few years old. They are finally caught, largely through the efforts of Nassau County detective Elmer Robinson (the director's grandfather) and executed at Sing Sing.Kastle's film is the better of the two, I think. It gets bonus points for having been made on a budget that would hardly accommodate a high school production of ""Our Town."" And it's an original, not a remake.And, although there are no bad performances in this new version, the casting in the 1970s was more accurate. It's easy to see here why Leto might be under the spell of somebody who looks like Salma Hayek. She's a beautiful woman with a bosom that bespeaks authority. But in the original, Shirley Stoler was so obese she could be seen from outer space. In that, she resembled the historical Martha Beck. And in the original, Tony LoBianco gave a more convincing performance as the seductive sleazebag. A lot of people saw Lared Leto here as a charm boy, but his appeal slipped past my apperceptive apparatus. He doesn't exude the kind of confidence and reassuring qualities that a good con man must have. He seems uncertain and nervous much of the time, an anomalous trait in what I suppose would technically be called an anti-social personality, socialized type. Hayek at least brings a good deal of passion to her role.I can understand why John Travolta's role was written into the tale. The murderous duo travel around on their spree, from New York to Florida to Michigan, and Travolta's detective, along with his sidekick (James Gandolfini) provide the audience with an anchor. They sort of stand in for us. But I'm at a loss to understand why the tsuris in Travolta's family life is dragged in. The wife who was a suicide, the son he argues with, the young lady (Laura Dern) he's dating. They have nothing to do with the story and they don't really tell us much about the character of Elmer Robinson. He comes off as a morose cop, just a bit less cynical than his colleagues.I found the chronology a little confusing too. In some cases I lost track of how the bodies were disposed of, and how many there were, and where, and how exactly the scam worked since we never see a single example played out from beginning to end. The two victims we get to know a little about (not very much) are Alice Krige and Dagmara Dominczyk. They're the only ones we're allowed to pity.It isn't a poor movie. Everyone involved displays a generous amount of talent, some more than others. (Even the little kid is pretty good, as little kids go.) But the production is Hollywoodized in a way the original was not. Everything seems carefully planned. The 1940s cars glisten brilliantly in the sunlight. A woman fastidiously apples lipstick after oral sex. The victims we see are attractive and relatively young, not the pathetic oldsters that provided the couple with grist for their gory mill. There is a tasteless scene in which we must see Jared Leto forced into the electric chair and then watch the ""fish fry"" in its entirety. There is no trial, just the execution. What did the writer have in mind when he put this scene in? Are we supposed to revel in the extinction of life, even if that life was thoroughly evil?",Lonely Hearts
6,Coventry,Owner of a Lonely Heart? Much better than victim of murder...,7,30 May 2010,"I personally have a severe weakness for horror/thriller movies that are based on real-life serial killer cases, mostly because the truth is even viler and more disturbing than the imagination of any given Hollywood scriptwriter. I've seen numerous film adaptations of real murder cases, but one of the most jaw-dropping and fascinating stories for me undoubtedly remains Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck's the Lonely Heart killings. Their modus operandi was simple but frighteningly disturbing. During only a very short period of time – the second half of the 1940's – Beck and Fernandez are believed to have killed over twenty women; all of them aged spinsters and single mothers who were unfortunate enough to place an add in the lonely hearts section of a newspaper. With his looks and natural charms Raymond could easily seduce the poor women and, with Martha posing his sister, they robbed and killed them. The ironic aspect about the case is that they themselves met and fell in love through an add in the paper. These are strictly the facts of the case, but the problem with ""Lonely Hearts"" is that it's a Hollywood production and thus naturally tends to deviate from the genuineness in favor to appeal to wider audiences. The film introduces an impressive list of cast members, including John Travolta, Salma Hayek and James Gandolfini, and writer/director Todd Robinson is the actual grandson of police inspector Robinson who was in charge of the Lonely Hearts investigation. He processes a lot of rather irrelevant sub plots into the script, like the remorse over his own wife's suicide and the personal issues with his teenage son and colleague love interest, which aren't directly connected to the murder investigation. Therefore, if you're interested in a truly faithful adaptation of the same case, I strongly recommend Leonard Kastle's film ""The Honeymoon Killers"". That movie also features a lot more detailed accuracy. For example, the real Martha Beck was a woman struggling with obesity and a lack of confidence, whereas in this version she's portrayed by natural beauty Salma Hayek who spontaneously gives oral sex to a highway patrolman to evade a speeding ticket. Now, the occasional lack of accuracy and diversion doesn't mean that ""Lonely Hearts"" is a bad film, of course. Far from it, in fact, as I can honestly admit I was glued to the TV-screen throughout the entire film. The biggest trump is that Todd Robinson re-creates an admirably moody and depressing film-noir atmosphere, complete with typical narration and an astonishing cinematography. The costumes and scenery (including old cars and farmhouses), as well as the color schemes and music, catapult you straight back to the 1940's. In spite the fact that ""Lonely Hearts"" is full of famous Hollywood faces, the film is also surprisingly shockingly violent and occasionally even quite nihilistic in tone. The murders of Jeanette Long and Delphine Downing are graphically depicted and definitely not suitable for sensitive viewers. Last but not least the acting performances are praiseworthy. Especially Salma Hayek impresses with her portrayal of the sickly jealous and psychopathic Martha Beck and Jared Leto isn't bad neither, as the emotionless and sly Raymond Fernandez.",Lonely Hearts
7,michaelRokeefe,Until death do they part.,7,4 August 2007,"Todd Robinson directs this entertaining crime drama that picks up steam and rolls. Elmer Robinson(John Travolta)and colleagues Charles Hildebrandt(James Gandolfini)and Detective Reilly(Scott Caan)investigate a series of crimes in which the victims are lonely women that fall for a killer con man. Ray Fernandez, alias Ray Martin(Jared Leto)makes a living by placing ads in singles magazines and luring rich, lonely women into a relationship. Ray is aided by another psychopath, Martha Beck(Salma Hayek),who claims to be his sister and a nurse. As the body count increases, Martha becomes increasingly brutal, jealous and very combustible. Elmer is obsessed with solving these cold-blooded crimes. Of course it seems in a lot of crime films that the bad guys are more colorful and interesting than the heroes. No doubt about Miss Hayek dominating each scene she appears. Also in the cast: Laura Dern, Andrew Wheeler, Alice Krige and Dan Byrd.",Lonely Hearts
8,grantss,Decent plot but lacks intrigue and engagement,5,6 April 2021,"Ray Fernandez is a slick charmer who cons lonely women out of their savings. Then he meets Martha Beck, a woman of similar morals and modus operandi, and they're perfect for each other. He continues seducing women out of their savings, however, leading to jealousy on Martha's part. The result is a series of murders across several states. On their trail is a pair of jaded yet experienced and resourceful police detectives.This film had the potential to be great: based on a true story, the serial killers, the dogged detectives, the femme fatale, the one detective's mental demons, the psychology of the killers, the film noir feel. Yet it feels quite flat and listless.The plot is decent (it is, after all, based on a true story) and develops okay, if in conventional linear form. Yet there's no intrigue. You know who the villains are, you know the detectives are after them and how close they are to catching them (or not). It's all pretty much black and white.In addition, there's no character engagement. The person we're supposed to be rooting for is Elmer Robinson, the lead detective. However he is played by John Travolta and that's what sinks the character side: it's pretty much a by-the-numbers performance (like most of his performances. The only good performances of his I can think of are in Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty). James Gandolfini is okay as his sidekick but can't make for Travolta's lack of likeability. Throw in a very hammy, over-the-top performance by Scott Caan and the cops are hardly winning you over.Jared Leto and Salma Hayek are fairly good as the serial killers though.Interesting to note that the writer-director, Todd Robinson, is the grandson of Elmer Robinson so this film had personal meaning for him. Not sure if that somehow inhibited his direction, making for the listless affair we end with. Or maybe it was just that John Travolta was in the lead role.",Lonely Hearts
9,gradyharp,Stepping Back Into the 1950s: An Imitation Film Noir,7,3 August 2007,"LONELY HEARTS tries very hard to evoke the feeling of the 1950s and the troubled police officer whose wife's suicide haunts him until he finds revenge in the investigation of a pair of lonely hearts scam artists. But what happens for the most part is a story that looks, sounds and fells like a 1950s crime movie - 3 parts celluloid transfer, 1 part story.John Travolta and James Gandolfini play buddy homicide detectives who overcome the ennui of their job when they begin to investigate the multiple murders of 'lonely women' who fall prey to snappy con artist men. The pair they are chasing are Ray Fernandez (Jared Leto) and his partner in crime Martha Beck (Salma Hayek), a diabolical couple who find their victims through the personal ads and then fleece then murder them victims in heinous ways. Todd Robinson wrote and directed the film based on his grandfather's experience - Elmer C. Robinson (Travolta) - and it is this bit of personal touch that makes the sluggish story work. The capable supporting cast includes such solid actors as Laura Dern and Scott Cain with fine cameos by Alice Krige and Dagmara Dominczyk, playing victims.Hayek and Leto muster a chemistry on the screen that, while strange in type, allows the viewer to understand the motivation of the crimes. It is a solid cast and a good story: it just seems more derivative of old movies than a film with original thought. Grady Harp",Lonely Hearts
10,Sylviastel,A mixture of truth and fiction!,5,13 April 2008,"Okay if you know the true story about Martha Beck and Raymond Martinez Fernandez, you would know that Martha Beck was an overweight nurse, single mother of two children that she abandoned. The casting of Selma Hayek is fine but they make no attempt in allowing her to be Martha Beck. She is too glamorized in this role. I have no problem with Jared Leto in the role of Raymond. Of course, my biggest problem with the film is the concentration on the cops played by John Travolta and James Gandolfini. While the costume designs, acting, and directing are first rate, the writers and director does take artistic liberties. I actually felt bad for the characters of Beck and Fernandez even though their main motives was to profit from the dead of unsuspecting women like Janet Fay who was actually 66 years old but played by a much younger actress. I felt that the film is worth watching but it's painful to watch at times.",Lonely Hearts
11,deloudelouvain,Entertaining Noir about a devilish couple.,7,20 November 2020,"I never heard of this couple of serial killers before so I didn't know anything about the story. It's entertaining though, makes you wonder what's going on in some peoples minds, how sick in the head do you have be to act like that? Preying on innocent and quite desperate people to take advantage of them and to ultimately murder them it's just the lowest you can go. The movie/biography is well made but it's the excellent acting that makes it stands out. The late James Gandolfini, John Travolta, Salma Hayek and Jared Leto, all actors that are almost a guarantee for success just because of their great acting skills. John Travolta might be a lunatic in real life, as a member of the church of scientology, but he's a good actor, we got to give him that. The star of Lonely Hearts is Salma Hayek though, excellent portraying of her character. To me the best performance in this entertaining Noir. Lonely Hearts is a good movie if you like true stories about serial killers, it's well made and deserves a good rating.",Lonely Hearts
12,lasttimeisaw,Lonely Hearts - 6/10,6,17 April 2007,"Another story about serial killers, this time the killers are a couple, they hunted for ""lonely hearts"" - lonely women hunger for love by publishing ads in the newspaper, no matter young or older. They disguised as brother and sister, then the male killer got involved with the victims and squeezed every penny of them, eventually murdered them. Another storyline in this film is a policeman who investigated these cases but he had his dark past, three years later, his wife committed suicide without leaving any explanation. This accident bothered and ruined his whole life, including his work and his personal life. When he was looking after the couples, he also start to learn how to face the new life.First of all, I am so sick of John Travolta's big face, even though his acting is not that bad, I just cannot stand him, which leaves me a very bad impression. I know he's a famous Hollywood star, but, how he can do that to himself? His image is not suitable for acting anymore, horrible to see him now. So I decide that I will never watch ""The Wild Hogs"" and ""Hairspray"".This film is not as ambitious as ""The Black Dahlia"", at least the story is quite clear and might be a little bit long and boring in the middle, but the only savior is definitely Salma Hayek. To me, it's her best acting time, (btw, I haven't seen ""Forida""), a dangerous, heartless killer who was deeply in love with her partner, and the jealousy drove her mad, and also led their way to the death penalty. Jared Leto is good, but James Gandolfini and Laura Dern are wasted.I heard the serial murders are true events in USA, and women always intend to be blindly in love and turn themselves victims in the end. I just want to say nowadays, romantic love is not everything, we are mature enough to handle the relationships and sensibilities, no more lonely hearts anymore. Life is always like a gold-mine, waiting everyone to dig and find, fun is everywhere.",Lonely Hearts
13,Buddy-51,stellar cast trapped in film noir misfire,4,20 October 2007,"Based on the true story of a serial killer couple, Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez, ""Lonely Hearts"" sometimes feels more like a parody of a 1940's film noir drama than a film noir drama itself. This is particularly disappointing given the high-octane rating of its cast which includes John Travolta, James Gandolfini, Salma Hayek, Laura Dern and Jared Leto among others.Travolta and Gandolfini play two homicide detectives hot on the trail of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck (Leto and Hayek), two psychopaths who, posing as a lovesick Lothario and his spinster sister, bilk money out of lonely women who post pen pal want ads in papers around the nation. After one of the women turns up dead in her bathtub (seemingly a suicide), the two investigators discover that these individuals may have cut a much more impressive swath of death across the country than originally suspected.Written and directed by Todd Robinson, ""Lonely Hearts"" is a second-rate detective drama that, at most, gives viewers the chance to watch a bunch of A-list level actors play dress-up for close to two hours. Everybody looks dashing in their fedoras and high heels, but beyond that there is little of substance here to engage either the interest or the imagination of the audience. The screenplay lines up the usual array of film noir stereotypes, including the brooding detective, the wisecracking cynic, the nettlesome jokester, the virtuous woman, the heartless female fatale, and the henpecked petty criminal. Moreover, the arch dialogue and over-earnest acting on the part of Travolta and Gandolfini add to the decidedly faux-noir feeling.The relationship between the psychopathic lovebirds is so much more complex and intriguing than anything else in the movie that every time we cut to the investigation (which takes up a goodly portion of the film) the story pretty much stops dead in its tracks. However, the killers leave so many clues and dead bodies in their wake that it's amazing it takes the authorities as long as it does to finally track them down.There's admittedly a certain poignancy that creeps into the closing stretches of the story, but it really isn't enough to rescue the fine actors or the movie itself from the overall taint of mediocrity.",Lonely Hearts
14,secondtake,"All the elements are there, including a great cast, but it doesn't click, doesn't tear into you",6,17 December 2011,"Lonely Hearts (2006)A steady, interesting, colorful crime movie packed with both great old tropes from the film noir days and lots of familiar tricks. Amazingly, it's based on a true story from post-war America that goes way way way beyond the slimmed up version here. The result is good, yes, but never mesmerizing, never a complete surprise, and never up to the potential of the either the source material or the talented cast. The very dependence of well known formulas for a kind of classic look and feel is what holds it back, because we know those formulas so well. The one aspect to the movie that is forcibly modern is the one that feels so forced it's almost pandering to a contemporary audience--lots of open swearing and sexual references in a manner not really ""right"" for a 1951 America.Several lead actors are terrific. Salma Hayek, once she arrives, is an edgy bad girl, a woman with little moral code and a comfort level with blood and manipulation that makes an old school femme fatale look like schoolroom stuff. Her bad boy companion, Jared Leto, at first comes off as a Robert Downey Jr. wannabe, but he gradually hardens up his edges and by the end is pretty believable as a cocksure murderous idiot. The two cops, John Travolta and James Gandolfini, are a great pair, the one restrained and more in tune with the criminals, the other the sidekick with a good heart. (They might be modeled after, say, Glenn Ford and William Bendix, as two 1951 actors who could have pulled off the same roles with more conviction.)The filming, the editing, the pace, the sets, the old cars, the interior and exterior location shoots, all of the nuts and bolts are in place here for a good movie. (Of these, the photography is the most routine, partly because of how it's directed, as in the last scene when the cops swarm the house--it could have been really exciting.) But overall it's the script--the script, not the story--that holds it all back. The parallel plots of the two criminals in their love affair crime spree and the cops on their trail is clear and fine, but unrevealing. The events happen, and we sort of know how it will end. And it does (not to give away anything!). If you want the true facts, go to the really long but readable account at trutv.com and type in the Lonely Hearts. As a quick and hopefully helpful movie comparison, you can look at recent films like ""Road to Perdition"" or ""Shutter Island"" and see how a period piece film can brim with originality and better filming. A movie comes closer to this kind of familiar quality, based on older classic Hollywood models, is ""Public Enemies"" with Johnny Depp, though that one had some really beautiful moments in the photography. And what about that title? It is derived from the male killer's original tactic for getting money, which is given a comic treatment at the beginning of the movie--he writes to lonely women, gets them to fall in love with him, and steals their assets.A final revealing note: the director is the grandson of the cop who led the original investigation into the crimes. That means he's really well placed emotionally, but as a director he's really incomplete. It's amazing, in fact, that he got the budget and talent he did with such a short track record. Opportunity squandered? Partially. Give it a chance.",Lonely Hearts
15,Rodrigo_Amaro,A seductive noir but not much engaging,6,13 July 2012,"""Lonely Hearts"" tells us the real story of the ""Lonely Hearts KIllers"", the couple Martha Beck and Raymond Martinez (played by Salma Hayek and Jared Leto) and the police investigation conducted by an obstinate detective (John Travolta) recently traumatized with the unexplainable suicide of his wife. The couple's ""name"" came from the scam they practiced against lonely women who wanted to engage in a relationship with a man through adds on newspaper's personal columns.Looks like 2006 was the year to rediscover the film noir. This came out on the same year as Brian De Palma's ""Black Dahlia"" but attracted less attention. With justice, that was a better film. ""Lonely Hearts"" presents a good story that pays some small reflection on people who were looking for something good, tried of everything to have a relationship but failed at that, being tricked into the unknown, letting themselves get fooled by looks and charm, and it's also a story about serial killers who take advantage of such situation to simply steal money and take away lives. It sounds very contemporary the small appeal the movie has, just think bigger how this plot would be treated today with the internet and new ways to meet people. We would have what we're get used to see in the news. Being ""accomplices"" of the couple in their spree of killing is interesting, wild, an exquisite relationship they have with each other (ironically, Raymond always make the con alone and he was about to try on Martha, who noticed it and started to help him); the background story for Travolta's character sometimes work, other times doesn't involve us at all, the investigation when made right works fine with some thrilling scenes. But the majority of scenes here is constantly showing the lack of cooperation between the detectives played by James Gandolfini (and his annoying voice-over) and Scott Caan. Why we're forced to watch them fight and play like kids all the time, what's the point? The acting deserves some credit, specially for Leto playing a character that rare young actors would like to play, sacrificing his good looks to appear less beautiful to the camera with a hair piece to hide his slightly baldness. He's a weak fella, someone who at first only wanted to get money from his victims to later be seduced by this woman who'll boss around him to make anything for her, including the murders of the worst kind. Hayek is a little over-the-top but she knows how to leave a good impression anyhow. Laura Dern is very good in the ungrateful role of the female detective who takes interest on poor Travolta, always trying to be more than just an affair.For the most part, characters and the movie sink little by little into a dark corner, too much predictable but somehow it manages to not disappoint. Compared with ""Black Dahlia"" since both are film noir updates of the 21st century it fails for not being more clever, more intriguing. Clearly, De Palma had to imagine many unbelievable devices to present the story but at least it was great. Here, even if the story is very close to the truth, and the fact of the director being related to the main character doesn't count much. To quote Kubrick: ""It is real but it's not interesting"". 6/10",Lonely Hearts
16,Dr_Coulardeau,"Dynamic, substantial, yet slightly easy",9,16 December 2010,"I here compare this film with its model, Lonely Hearts (1969).The two films go together since the former is a remake of the latter. They have to be watched together, one after the other, no matter in what order. The story is pathetic and pitiful. A man takes advantage of the loneliness of some women to literally ""abduct"" them from sanity and ""infect"" them with infatuation, which enables him to clean them up of their possessions. But one really falls in love and she abducts him from sanity and infects him with her jealousy into killing the women on whose backs they live. A killing couple, supposedly brother and sister, who skim and milk the crowd of solitary and lonely middle class women.The older film (1969) in black and white was a small budget thriller and it shows how jealousy is mounting and building up in the woman and how she manipulates the man into becoming a killer, till the moment she discovers he is a liar. Then she will cause his downfall herself and her own at the same time. Pure jealousy confronted to a lying partner in a situation that can only give birth to extreme jealousy. It is not easy to be a female pimp of a male gigolo. But the man and the woman are both perfectly composed and logical till the end. The beginning though seems too slow.The more recent film (2006) shifts the vision of the criminal situation from a more or less objective unidentified abstract observer to a team of two cops following the murderers and the bloody trail they leave behind. And the observer is the partner of the main detective. This film shifts the criminal idea from pure jealousy in the woman to insanity in the man. He is a killer instead of being a manipulated gigolo. He is not lying to the woman but she can't stand what she makes him do, hence she is crazy somewhere too. But she will not cause his downfall. They will be caught up by the cops from New York because he starts enjoying killing simple witnesses or passers-by. But here the beginning is turned into some circus parade.This latter film intensively also shows Old Sparky, the full execution of the man with it and only the first phase for the woman. It becomes a graphic film against death penalty since Old Sparky is positioned both at the beginning and at the end of the film, sandwiching the story between these haunting visions. The technique used in this color film is a lot more dynamic and lively than in the older film. But it does not really add to the subject except the vision of Old Sparky but it is an easy explanation to declare a criminal crazy. He might be deranged and get deranged by his own crimes but he has to be sane and perfectly well balanced to go on with killing and escaping.

No doubt the strong sexual content has had something to do with this: we may be stupid and ultraviolent in this schizo country of ours, but we're also prudes. Beautifully written and directed, LONELY HEARTS gives John Travolta yet one more golden opportunity to be Golden. Likewsie, Gandolfini, whose performance goes hand-in-hand with Travolta's. Hyek does what she can with her role, but the fact that the character was changed from an overweight wallflower to... well, Selma Hyek... is a detriment. One could've (at least superficially) understood her obsession with holding on to ""her man"" if she'd been portrayed as the dumpy matron she was in Life: as it stands, Hyek seems shoe-horned into the part. (Kathy Bates would've been a much better choice.) Despite this, the movie resonates. It's hard to believe it wasn't more highly touted (I don't even recall seeing it advertised anywhere)...",Lonely Hearts
18,johnnyboyz,Put across as a neo-noir but this works better as a period drama based on true events.,6,17 June 2008,"Part of the reason I love the neo-noir genre and the noir genre in general is being able to see things from the 'baddies' point of view. It's perhaps true to say that there are no good guys in the genre of noir because everyone's just as seedy, seductive and nasty as each other but the genre still predominantly contains films that show certain characters and their lives and how it all unfolds. What makes the genre so enjoyable for me is its capturing of a point of view from an angle you don't usually get in dominant formula genres. That is to say, spending a film with people who kill, seduce, betray and lie their way to whatever goal they have can be a refreshing and entertaining alternate to your usual fare.So it's with some deal of frustration to say that Lonely Hearts succeeds as a well shot and well unfolded urban drama that most of the time takes place amongst rural settings. The film is about a subject I had no knowledge of prior to viewing and that subject is the tale of two killers in love as they rob and kill their way across America's lonely hearts pages in the 1950s. The film is given that added heart due to the fact director Todd Robinson's grandfather took part in the investigation for the two killers at the time of setting, in fact John Travolta plays Elmer Robinson; the grandfather of said director. So the film is given that added impetus of the personal. This is a man making a film on a subject that probably means a great deal to him in the same sense 'Clockers' might be rather a personal film for Spike Lee or This is England for Shane Meadows.But alas, the film falls marginally short of delivering a true noir experience with snappy dialogue, oddball but engaging characters and juxtaposed situations of death and fate. To put it bluntly, director Robinson is so clued up on his grandfather's exploits that he forgets to have fun with the villains and instead makes them genuinely un-likable, uninteresting and just plain nasty. Note how I said I like to see the films from the bad guys' perspective and whatever perspective we get here is a nasty, ugly and downright sordid insight into two people fleecing and killing innocent people. They are serial killers and are based on real people, but seeing them in action is just no fun; it would be like seeing the story of the character Marv in Sin City from the point of view of Kevin.So if we have distasteful villains then great but they make for lousy anti-heroes, something great noirs pride themselves on. With all this animosity toward the villains, our attention must be drawn toward the hero of the piece and that is Elmer (Travolta) himself. As a cop, Elmer is ego driven; gets very agitated at his family and sleeps around behind his wife's back  I sure as hell wouldn't perceive one of my grandfathers like that if I made a film revolving around them, but if that's how director Robinson knows how it all went down then fair enough. The trouble is, Lonely Hearts is just another standard detective fair under the smoke screen of noir. The police scenes with Charles Hilderbrandt (Gandolfini) are ego driven; the setting is 1950s America (Hollywood's golden era for noir); Martha Beck (Hayek) carries all the femme fatale tags including large rack, seductive smoking and willingness to kill; the use of flashbacks are present as are the gruff voiceovers (surprisingly told from Hilderbrandt's point of view) and the film carries that general air of a colourless atmosphere that makes you wonder why it wasn't just done in black and white anyway.But there is some good, if indeed 'fun' to be had out of Lonely Hearts. The struggle in power between killers Martha and Ray Fernandez (Leto) is interesting, best summed up early on when Martha points the phallic symbol of the gun into Ray's phallus shortly after oral sex telling him that they are in this together and she is not scared of making decisions, no matter how risky they seem. This eerie build up works later on when (coincidently?) during a sex scene between Ray and a girl they are trying to fleece, Martha breaks in and 'interrupts' the session with another phallic weapon, this time of the mêlée variety. Then there is the engaging way in which the story is told. Hilderbrandt narrates as we know, but this is Elmer Robinson's story and his efforts in catching up with the killers as well as balancing his own life is told via manipulation of flashbacks parallel to one another.But the film feels anticlimactic if not somewhat flat overall. Martha spends too much time bickering to Ray and certainly represents the dominant part of the twosome in the sense Ray seems relegated to that of the lackey. He is the one that does all the work; he is the one that must dress up in effeminate wigs and have his true identity made false whereas Martha is just the psychotic person she is always surveying. But Hayek is frustrating most of the time in her bickering and uncontrollable temper; too much of the time having her dialogue centre around the moral choice of getting rid of a child. This film is based on real life people doing real life things and that renders the film better for realism than for typical, entertaining neo-noir escapism.",Lonely Hearts
19,Turfseer,Tired Serial Killer Retread,3,15 February 2009,"Lonely Hearts chronicles the true story of the rise and fall of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, serial killers, who were responsible for a series of gruesome murders beginning in 1949 on Long Island. Fernandez initially started as a solo act, conning widows and love-starved lonely hearts out of their life savings. After he met up with Beck (in real life unattractive and overweight but here played by the attractive Salma Hayek), the pair then turned to murder while plying their nefarious trade.The film was written and directed by Todd Robinson, who happens to be the grandson of Detective Elmer Robinson, the lead detective who basically was responsible for tracking the two psychopaths down and bringing them to justice. Robinson is played by a grim-faced John Travolta who attempts to convey the detective's working class persona. James Gandolfini plays Charles Hildebrandt, Robinson's detective sidekick who is the film's narrator (a more skilled screenwriter could possibly have dispensed with the narration and conveyed important information on a visual level).The main problem with the film's narrative is that we're a captive audience as the two intrepid detectives proceed very slowly in trying to establish that it's Fernandez and Beck who are responsible for the murders they are investigating. While the investigation may have proceeded at a snail's pace in real life, it doesn't make for good drama. A good deal of judicious editing could have improved this film quite a bit. What's more, Robinson and Hildebrandt are pitted against another team of detectives who are unethical and the 'good cop-bad cop' clashes between the two pairs are full of clichés (a scene involving a discussion about Jackie Robinson inside the squad room, tinged with racial overtones, appears clearly anachronistic).Detective Robinson's troubled personal life constitutes the film's ""B"" Story. We learn that his wife had committed suicide prior to working on the Fernandez-Beck case but we never find out why she did it. Travolta doesn't have much to do except almost coming to blows with his superiors and colleagues whenever the subject of his late wife is brought to the fore. Laura Dern plays Robinson's girlfriend but that relationship doesn't seem to go anywhere during the film. Gandolfini is unable to jettison his Tony Soprano persona despite playing a character on the other side of the law.The rest of the film deals with the relationship between Fernandez (played by Jared Leto) and Hayek's Beck. There aren't a great deal of twists and turns as the killers dispose of one victim after another. Hayek plays Beck as over the top and the director seems obsessed with emphasizing her penchant for oral sex. Leto's Fernandez is pretty much one note as we get it early on that he's a passive-aggressive personality, obeying the orders of his Svengali-like lover.There's a great deal of attention paid to period detail in this film and it seems more attention was paid to the set design than on the script itself. Lonely Hearts was a failure at the box office and it's pretty clear that early word of mouth had to be pretty negative. It might have been a mistake on the part of the film's producers to have hired the grandson of the film's protagonist to write and direct as he was probably too close to the material to be objective about it. His grandfather's personal life did not turn out to be very engaging the way he told it.The subject of Lonely Hearts was already done years ago in a much more successful film entitled ""The Honeymoon Killers"". One wonders if there was anything really more to say about this subject matter. With the glut of screenplays out there for producers to pick from, I'm wondering how and why Lonely Hearts actually got made. One thing is for sure: film buffs will not be talking about this one in the years to come.",Lonely Hearts
20,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,19 October 2021,"Well a lot of people have pointed out that it is full of cop cliche's... and I won't disagree, but it's a neo noir, and rather than cliche I would call them ""tropes"" as in, it does it's best to hit as many tropes as it can...... and as someone that loves the genre in print, in comic, and on the silver screen, I appreciate that.My only complaint is Travolta who seems to pick and choose what roles he acts in and what roles he does the Gotti in. In this case, he's doing the Gotti...... but Gandolfini does a great job, Leto has one of the roles where he's acting and not being, well, Leto, and Hayek is amazing so it all comes together to make a decent film.In fact, Gandolfini does such a great job with the narration work that it breaks the heart he didn't become the next Leonard Nemoi/Morgan Freeman goto narrator for documentaries.It's a trope filled fest, but tropes aren't bad when you expect a film to hit them.",Lonely Hearts
21,MBunge,A weird sort of nepotism prevents this film from being even better,6,3 October 2010,"This is a dark, shocking and fairly gripping crime story undercut slightly by some bad storytelling decisions. It's like a wonderful meal where the chef decided to use pepper when he should have used salt. It doesn't ruin anything but it leaves a bit of an odd taste in your mouth.Based on a real life story from around 1950, Lonely Hearts is about Ray Fernandez (Jared Leto) and Martha Beck (Salma Hayek), a small time con man and the crazy woman who led him into a murder spree. At least it should have been about them because they are both fascinating characters and Jared Leto and Salma Hayek give strong performances in the roles. Unfortunately, writer/director Todd Robinson decided that Ray and Martha would have to share the screen equally with Elmer ""Buster"" Robinson (John Travolta), the police detective who eventually brought Ray and Martha to justice. Buster isn't really that interesting and it isn't helped by John Travolta giving one of the most sedentary and impassive performances of his career.Ray Fernandez was a confidence man who used his easy charm and a toupee to romance widows and old maids he met through ""lonely hearts"" newsletters and then took all their money. When he tries to take advantage of Martha, she not only sees through him, she overwhelms him with her passion and latches onto Ray with the obsession that the emotionally-damaged call love. Ray is a bad guy but he's also a normal guy who's almost helpless against the manipulation of the sociopathic Martha. She's incapable of considering anything but her own unquestioned needs and it gives her a strength that Ray finds irresistible. This common criminal and this deranged woman come together and turn petty crimes into inhuman savagery.The story also deals with Buster Robinson's uneasy relationship with his his partner Charlie (James Gandolfini) and his lover Renee (Laura Dern), a woman who works at his precinct. Underneath it all is Buster's unresolved sorrow and grief over the unexplained suicide of his wife. The problem is that all of Buster's difficulties are addressed in a perfunctory manner and don't connect in either a direct or analogous way to Ray and Martha's story. Nothing about Buster's life is all that compelling. It's certainly not as engrossing as Ray and Martha's twisted union or their relationship with their poor victims. When the film focuses on those women and how their unhappiness, personal hardship and hope made them vulnerable, it is both creepy and riveting. Writer/director Todd Robinson is the grandson of the real Buster Robinson, but his desire to enhance his grandfather's role in the story distracts from the heart of the tale without adding enough substance on its own. The film is also hurt by some intrusive and pointless narration by Buster's partner and an excessive amount of vulgarity and crudity from the cops at the start of the film that spoils the illusion of 1950s wholesomeness that would have been such an affecting counterpoint to Ray and Martha's depravity. I'm sure the police of that era didn't talk and act like Shirley Temple, but it was an age where manners and social order were almost oppressively strong and I don't think writer/director Robinson has any idea how different then was from now.For the outstanding acting of Leto and Hayek and its powerful, startling moments of human brutality, Lonely Hearts is well worth watching. It could have been even better, but you can't hold that against it.",Lonely Hearts
22,Lechuguilla,Travolta's Cinematic Vehicle,2,4 October 2010,"The real-life story of Ray Fernandez and Martha Beck is quite compelling. They teamed up in the early 1950s to swindle lonely old ladies out of their fortunes. That storyline is presented directly and clearly in the 1969 movie ""The Honeymoon Killers"".Unfortunately, the same storyline gets lost in ""Lonely Hearts"", a drab, dreary, really dreadful movie less interested in the Fernandez/Beck plot than in the promotion of Hollywood celebrity Travolta, who plays an obsessed cop on the scent of the depraved duo. After the first few minutes the viewer easily gets the drift of this film.Every time Travolta, or his cop buddies, came into view, I fast-forwarded the DVD. What I wanted to see was Fernandez and Beck, not some irrelevant cop, and surely not a cop played by Travolta, an actor who needs to retire. With every movie he makes, he looks worse and worse. His cop buddy here, played by James Gandolfini, is hardly any more appealing, with all that unnecessary bad language. And the inclusion of the totally untalented Scott Caan makes a mockery of the casting. But it gets worse.The real Martha Beck was heavy, even fat. Here, they cast thin, voluptuous Salma Hayek to play Beck. Clearly, the filmmakers were not interested in historical authenticity. They probably reasoned, incorrectly, that viewers are ignorant of the facts in the case. Further, the pouty, one-note performance of Hayek is laughably embarrassing. She is another actor who needs to retire.""The Honeymoon Killers"" is a film that definitely has its weaknesses. But at least it focuses on what is important, the story of Fernandez and Beck. It is an honest movie. Anyone interested in the facts needs to watch that movie, not this one. ""Lonely Hearts"" is not far removed from outright mendacity, and is clearly aimed at promoting current Hollywood star celebrities at the expense of historical accuracy.",Lonely Hearts

24,Samiam3,Nice looking film with a clumsy screenplay,6,17 July 2010,"I will give credit to Lonely Hearts where credit is due. This motion picture does a fine job of recapturing the spirit of film noir. As a side effect it, feels a bit derivative but it has exceptional style. The plot line is not so strong. Writer director Todd Robinson gives us the story of his grandfather Elmer J. Robinson; the detective who went after Ray Fernadez and Martha Beck; a somewhat mixed match couple who went across New York state posing as brother and sister, killing unmarried women and taking their money (after Ray seduced them of course).Lonely Hearts is convinced that it can give us two stories for the price of one, so it splits into two narratives, one for the good guys and one for the bad guys. This is the single biggest problem with the movie. The bad guy portion takes up too much screen time. It is uninteresting and overdone, with Jared Leto and Salma Hayek giving terrible performances. What I would've liked to see more of is John Travolta become a character in the movie. He doesn't amount to very much, just a body to go inside a nice coat and a hat. He doesn't really come alive until the last couple of scenes, and by then it is too late.Lonely Hearts may in the end prove enjoyable if film-noir is your cup of tea. While the images here are strong, the material is in need of some polishing and maybe some brains.",Lonely Hearts

26,seymourblack-1,"""Hell's Coming Home For Xmas""",8,27 October 2016,"The exploits of a murderous couple who, in the late 1940s, became known as ""The Lonely Hearts Killers"" generated a great deal of public interest because of their long-running crime spree and the gruesome nature of the numerous murders that they committed. It's no surprise, therefore, that their story has already provided the basis for a couple of movies and the most notable of these was Leonard Kastle's ""The Honeymoon Killers"" (1970). In Kastle's movie, the focus remained exclusively on the couple and there was never any intimation that the police were on their tails. ""Lonely Hearts"", by contrast, tells its story by providing a balanced view of what took place, from the perspectives of both the criminals and the police.Interestingly, director and screenwriter, Todd Robinson is the grandson of the homicide detective who arrested the two killers and so his motivation for telling the story in the way he does is perfectly understandable.After the unexplained suicide of his wife three ears earlier, Nassau County police detective Elmer ""Buster"" Robinson (John Travolta) had fallen into a deep depression and unable to come to terms with what had happened, confined himself mainly to desk work. This changed however, when a woman's dead body was found in circumstances very similar to his wife's and his colleagues immediately concluded that the death was a suicide. From that point on, Buster became determined to prove that the woman in question had been murdered and to hunt down her killer. Although Detective Charles Hildebrandt (James Gandolfini), who'd been Buster's friend and partner since their ""squad car days"" wasn't convinced, he was nevertheless, pleased to see this positive change in his old buddy.Raymond Martinez Fernandez (Jared Leto) was a small-time scam-artist whose speciality was locating lonely single women through the newspaper personal ads and after writing to them for a while, would seduce them before relieving them of as much money as possible. One of his marks was ex-nurse Martha Beck (Salma Hayek), but after discovering that she was unemployed, he immediately lost interest in her. Unexpectedly though, Martha recognised what Raymond was up to and enthusiastically joined him in his endeavours, posing as his sister. Unfortunately, Raymond soon discovered that his new partner-in-crime was intensely jealous of the ladies he targeted and was, not only swift to turn her hand to murder, but also to goad Raymond into murdering as well.The couple's murderous rampage continued unabated for some time before Buster, who was also preoccupied by problems with his personal relationships, was eventually able to catch up with the pair and bring them to justice.""Lonely Hearts"" is a beautifully made film that successfully captures the look and atmosphere of the period in which it's set and features some great hardboiled dialogue. At one point, Buster predicts that ""Hell's coming home for Xmas"" if Raymond ever decides to dump Martha.Adding an account of the police perspective on the investigation provides some extra interest but what's more difficult to understand is why some departures from the true story were included for no apparent reasons. Fernandez didn't, in fact, kill a police officer and an old man as depicted in this movie and Martha Beck, in reality, was an unattractive, insecure woman who weighed over 200 lbs and was not Hispanic.This movie boasts a terrific cast of actors who turn in some excellent performances. John Travolta conveys the troubled nature of his character who's struggling to come to terms with the death of his wife and to overcome problems with his relationships with his son and his secret lover. Jared Leto is good as the toupee-wearing gigolo who finds himself on the road to Hell after meeting Martha and Salma Hayek, although obviously miscast, brings great vitality to her role and does especially well in the scenes that she shares with Leto. James Gandolfini (who provides the movie's entertaining narration) also does a good job of playing a tough cop, whilst also simultaneously showing the warmth that exists between Hildebrandt and Robinson.Overall, ""Lonely Hearts"" is a worthwhile remake that's interesting and enjoyable to watch (especially for those who aren't too concerned about its factual inaccuracies).",Lonely Hearts
27,rajdoctor,Lonely Hearts,6,21 January 2007,"The Lonely Hearts Lonely Heart was released in Amsterdam without much hype. It also ran in few theatres. It is based on a true story of a couple who kills single women  widowed / divorced and rich to rob their money  ""The Lonely Heart Killers"".The premise starts with Jared Leto fast talking his way through lonely heart women, and in that course meets Salma Hayek  an unemployed girl who joins hands with Jared and pretending as his sister  starts the race of going from one place to another  leaving a trial of murders. John Travolta and James Gandolfini play cops who are in pursue of this couple killers. The director Todd Robinson runs a parallel sub-plot of John Travolta's life and his evolving relationships with a Laura Dern and his son  I thought that was quite unnecessary, with the fact being the basic premise of the movie was very strong, and with Salma Hayek in her prime form  there was no need to add another female character.Salma Hayek has played a subtly psychotic character who captures Jared Leto's life  and in jealously of Jared's involvement with widow or divorce women  goes on the rampage of killing them; at times forcing Jared to do so on her behalf. The story in the latter half is more engrossing than the former. During the last episode we assume that Salma develops an emotional bond with the women, whom they are trying to cheat  but the love to Jared and jealously of not bearing her man getting attracted towards any women  ends up in killing the women and also her young child.John Travolta has given a punching performance as a cop who is seeking answers himself of his wife's suicide (the film begins with that scene) and building evidence to track the couple killers.The film is shot very well, and the story develops and grows gradually upon you. The last scene of Salma and Jared's execution becomes touching by Salma's voice-over describing the love shared by them; as if our heart goes for actually saving this brutal killers.Last a mention of Jared Leto, who looks in his getup similar to the original killer and hats off to him for giving a good performance. But the movie and show would be remembered by the cold blooded performance by beautiful Salma.(6 Star)",Lonely Hearts

Detective Elmer C.

Beck and Fernandez were way different Fernandez who was infatuated with Beck and would even kill for her and did, and Beck who was psychotic in her returned love for robinson Quoted as saying : I was the only woman for Raymond. This movie could've fallen in the footsteps of Bonnie and clyde if it was only made a tad cooler and more believable. Hayek is awesome in the role in fact left me wanting to see her again in the future in a psychotic role. The only part of this that i didn't like is Hayek is extremely beautiful with a nice figure and the real life Marth Beck was anything but. Weighing in at 250lbs she always feared losing Fernandez to one of his cons. Which made her all the more jealous and murderous.

32,nturner,A Twist on An Actual Crime,8,7 November 2008,"This film is an interesting take on actual crimes that occurred in the late 1940's. The criminals were Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck. Fernandez had been conducting cons of lonely women for a number of years in which he would wine and dine them, worm his way into their lives and eventually steal their money - all of this through ads in lonely hearts magazines - the Match.com of the times.In 1947, he answered an ad by Martha Beck. This coupling of two demented beings produced a monster of indescribable evil. It is pretty much confirmed that Beck seemed to have some sort of mysterious power over Fernandez. He was a reasonably handsome man, but she was fat and ugly. What was it that caused Fernandez to actually murder for this woman? The fact is that Beck was extremely sexually promiscuous and probably practiced acts not very common for the times. I'm sure there were deep psychological aspects to their relationship, but, simply put in the vernacular, Fernandez was letting his little head do the thinking for him.The two joined together in their con games with Beck posing as Fernandez's sister. It has been written that Beck was so possessive that she forbade Fernandez from entering into any sexual relationships with their marks, but the reality of this may be a little hard to believe.When captured, the two admitted to murdering three people. First was a sixty-six year old widow whom the two had taken to his Long Island apartment. Beck discovered her lover and the widow engaging in sex and bashed her head in with a hammer. She did not die, so Fernandez finished her off by chocking her to death. They then traveled to Michigan where they eventually murdered a young widow and her two-year-old daughter.The two were put to death in the electric chair in New York State in 1951.The film focuses upon the killers and the New York detectives who worked to solve the crimes. One was Elmer Robinson who was the grandfather of writer, director Todd Robinson. Lonely Hearts is really a tribute to his grandfather by Robinson, but that doesn't make the film any less intriguing and enjoyable.Even though the facts of the film are basically accurate, I think Robinson created a misstep in casting Salma Hayek as Martha Beck. Please be aware that Hayek gives a superior performance as an amoral woman obsessed with a man to the point of murder, but her physical appearance is so far afield from the real Beck that the relationship between Beck and Fernandez is totally blurred.In real life, one wonders what hold Beck held over Fernandez, but in this film relationships are reversed, and one must wonder what hold Fernandez has over the extremely sexy and desirable Beck as portrayed by Hayek. I guess you could say it doesn't really matter because obsessions on the part of both lead them to the murders. I guess, in this case, Hollywood wins out. After all, who would you rather see in the role - someone fat and ugly or Salma Hayek? Jared Leto gives an excellent performance as Raymond Fernandez. He gives us a duality of a man - one outgoing and charming and the other dark and needy. Plus he gets extra chops for the pain of makeup. Fernandez was a balding man who wore a toupee. Leto had to submit to shaving and having hairs plucked from his scalp in order to make his appearance genuine. Ouch! But, I guess he got paid a lot.The real stars of the film are John Travolta as Elmer Robinson and James Gandolfini as his partner. Travolta is a very good actor, and in Lonely Hearts he gives us a man determined to find two vicious killers while dealing with numerous family traumas. Todd Robinson certainly picked the best man to play his grandfather, and Travolta offers a heartfelt tribute to the real Elmer Robinson. Gandolfini is perfect as the big, rough guy with a heart even bigger who consistently supports his friend and partner. These two actors are a great combination.I really knew nothing of Lonely Hearts and have to give my movie rental website a pat on the back for recommending this film as one I might like. (It's really kind of scary as to how websites such come to know one so well.) If this is a film that has slipped through the cracks of your viewing possibilities, and you enjoy crime dramas, I heartedly recommend it.",Lonely Hearts

This, coupled with Gandolfini's retort ""funny, they say the same thing about women"", captures the essence of the Chandler-esquire dialog that peppers this true crime homage to film noir.The movie tells the story of Raymond Fernandez (Jared Leto) and Martha Beck who carved out their own chapter in the annals of crime history during the 1940s as the Lonely Hearts Killers. Together, Fernandez and Beck ran a con game using personal ads to seek out wealthy widows and single women with money. Fernandez would engage in correspondence with the women, eventually meeting them and gaining their trust as well as access to their money. Beck, would accompany him posing has his sister, helping Fernandez gain the trust of their victims, whom the two murdered after they'd drained their bank accounts. At the time of their capture, the body count they'd racked up was estimated at between 12 and 20.Directed by Todd Robinson, the grandson of detective Elmer Robinson (played by John Travolta), the story alternates between that of Fernandez and Beck, and pursuing detectives Robinson and Hildebrandt (Gandolfini), with Gandolfini handling the connecting voice-over narration in traditional film noire patter.Although some details are condensed for narrative purposes, the story largely sticks to the facts of the couple's actual murder spree, the only glaring discrepancy being the casting of Hayek as Beck, who in reality was a rotund, unattractive, battleaxe of a woman who maintained Fernandez's loyalty by granting his every sexual wish. The producers can be forgiven for opting to cast Hayek instead of a more credible Rosie O'Donnell type, however, as Hayek brings more than mere eye-candy to her role. She plays a sadistic, manipulative, cold-blooded murderer to the hilt, and practically serves as the driving engine for the film's story.With a crackerjack cast of Travolta, Gandolfini, Hayek, Leto and Laura Dern (as Robinson's love interest) all bringing their A-game, coupled with a smartly written screenplay, snappy dialog, good pacing, excellent cinematography and direction, the only oddity about this film is that it was relegated to limited theatrical release, largely playing a few festivals before being relegated to DVD. Unlike the case it is based on, this is one crime that probably will remain unsolved.",Lonely Hearts
35,DeuceWild_77,"""Lonely Hearts"" deserved a more focused storytelling and a compelling direction to be au pair with ""The Honeymoon Killers""...",6,12 April 2018,"The global success and Oscar nominations (and wins) for ""L.A. Confidential"" ('97) put the neo-noir / crime thriller genre back on the map in terms of Hollywood big productions, featuring major stars and established directors, and several films succeeded, such as ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""Hollywoodland"" (both from '06), based on real life cases of infamous murder, some unsolved to this days.""Lonely Hearts"" from the very same year, tells the real life story of Raymond Martinez Fernandez (played by Jared Leto) and Martha Beck (played by Salma Hayek), the notorious ""Lonely Hearts Killers"", a couple that during the 40's conned several wealthy widows, by placing ads in magazines, pretending to be brother and sister. 
As the delusional and sociopath Martha became more possessive towards Raymond, she starts killing his fiancees, afraid that he could fell in love with one of their unsuspecting victims.
Det. Elmer Robinson (John Travolta), a newly widower and his partner, Det. Charles Hilderbrandt (James Gandolfini) with the help of Det. Reilly (Scott Caan), are tasked to investigate the case...Screenwriter & documentary director, Todd Robinson, the real life grandson of Det. Elmer Robinson, made here his screen debut directing a theatrical released motion picture, which also penned the screenplay due to his emotional connection to the real life case, via his own grandfather, who told him curiosities about it since his early age.Robinson made good use of his Art Department: all the props; the sets' decoration; the hairstyles and costumes; the cars and the planes, are very faithful invoking the 40's Era and the movie looks and feels it visually. For its medium budget it's a hit.The screenplay could have been better handled, way too much screentime was given to the pair of detectives and their own private lifes, instead of focusing it more on the killers, enhancing the couple's wicked behavior and their descent into doom.
The added humor beetween Gandolfini and Scott Caan's characters always picking on each other, is somewhat funny at the beginning, but ultimately, repetitive and unnecessary.The cinematography is only appropriate as so is the direction, it have a certain TV feeling to it, maybe due to the budgetary reasons, it lacks wide shots and the violence is also toned down, with the noble exception of one well staged sordid scene involving the infamous couple and Alice Krige's character.The editing obviously suffered from scenes left out in the cutting room floor, maybe to shorten the movie to be more audience friendly, but that affects the storytelling with several breaks in the narrative and an anti-climatic (not so) grand finale.John Travolta is okay in the lead role of Elmer Robinson, with a good supporting turn from the late great James Gandolfini, even if his character was seriously underdeveloped, with both sharing good on-screen chemistry, proved earlier in ""Get Shorty"" ('95).
Scott Caan is in training mode for his future role of Danny Williams in the hit TV show, ""Hawaii Five-0"" and Laura Dern did her best out of a pointless character, Travolta's colleague at the Force and, secretly, his mistress.
Jared Leto as Ray Fernandez is over the top hammy, too cartoon-ish for a movie like this, almost shading his ridiculous performance in ""Panic Room"" ('02), but Salma Hayek saves the movie in the acting department, offering a commited performance as the wicked Martha Beck, had the movie being better she could have possibly been a contender for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.In short, ""Lonely Hearts"" deserves, at least, a watch for completists of neo-noir, ""killers on the run"" and period pieces, it's a kind of hybrid beetween ""Badlands"" & ""The Black Dahlia"" and even if it isn't as good as the previous adaptation of this story to the big screen, ""The Honeymoon Killers"" ('70), which was more faithful to the real life case and more focused on the couple, it have Salma in one of her best performances to date and some good cinematic moments...",Lonely Hearts

37,kneiss1,Atmospheric 40's crime thriller,7,21 September 2010,"I loved the actor, the atmosphere and especially the music. While the story itself wasn't great, it was told greatly. - The timing was perfect. All in all a great watching experience was created. If only I would have found the murdering couple more convincing. They have been drawn way too likable and ""nice"". It was simply unbelievable that those two sympathetic people could commit those crimes. (That goes especially for Jared Leto. Salma was able to convince me to be a beast most of the time.)The other problem I had, was the story around the detective Travolta. I didn't find it very interesting, and I believe it barely fit to the main theme of the movie.After checking IMDb I realized that this movie was based on a real story. Knowing that, I believe that the movie should have been more realistic, and more shocking. You didn't see their last and worst crime in the movie, you only heard the officers talking about it. Killing a child is one of the worst horrors you can commit. And it simply didn't seem shocking in this movie. There was no ""shock effect"". I don't ever want to see a child being killed on the television screen. That is not what I am asking for. - What they should have done, is: Show how they start to kill the child, and then turn back to John Travolta. That should have created the shock effect. I am not exactly a fan of movies telling real life crimes. I will never ever watch ""an American Crime"" again. - But I will always remember that movie with a shiver. I'll probably forget about Lonely Hearts.",Lonely Hearts
38,badgrrlkane,Really good direct to DVD release,8,4 August 2007,"Really good work from John Travolta but the real star of this show is Salma Hayek who as the murderess Martha Beck,she plays the character as cunningly evil & with as little remorse as a shark feeding on it's helpless prey. She is so in love with Jared Leto's character of Raymond Fernandez that just the thought of him even remotely feeling anything for his victim who he is conning throws her into a murderous rage. Jared Leto has the role of his career, playing the murderous con-man Ray.Looking very unsexy for a first time in any of his films( though while playing a junkie in Requiem for a Dream,he wasn't hideous but way to skinny) he as a toupee wearing thin mustached geek swoons these unsuspecting widows out of their panties & money & then Martha & Ray off them. For a pretty guy actor he plays down his looks as he is very geeky as Ray but he has charm & of course Mr Leto has awesomely blue eyes & the film has very suspenseful moments & just out right disturbing moments for a crime drama.Why this wasn't released theatrically, I don't know. It's definitely good enough.**** out of *****",Lonely Hearts
39,hcoursen,Why?,5,13 February 2009,"What was done here was pretty well done, though some jumps were confusing. And why Fernandez went at the end on a killing spree that was bound to get him nailed was unexplained, perhaps because inexplicable. The film did show convincingly the mindlessness of the late 40s and early 50s here in our dear land. But we were asked to witness a level of violence and sadism that may have been ""based on actual events"" but that had no redeeming frame. Does justice triumph? Only if one believes in the old testament ""eye for an eye"" premise that one cop enunciates to get himself over his queasiness after being a witness in the Sing Sing death house. That sequence is well done, but the other cop -- the prime mover in the chase and capture -- disagrees. The film does not even come out as an anti-death penalty tract, since the absolutely odious creatures who are executed make as good a case for capital punishment as any two could. Hayek's character vividly depicts obsessive jealousy and domination -- that is well done. But to what purpose? We are given no stance from which to observe, no chance to detach. The effect, then, is merely disturbing. If one is looking for what art can do, even with the worst of people, do not watch this film. I am not saying that a work of art must have a moral -- ""He prayeth best who loveth best, all things both great and small"" -- but that it create a distinction between what it depicts and our ability to be at even a slight remove from that depiction. This was gratuitous violence. Why was the film made? It serves only nihilism.",Lonely Hearts
40,petsteph1,Entertaining Performances,7,28 June 2007,"Hard to find anything to dislike about this thriller based on a true story, and hard not to like the actors and the way this was put together, but it felt a little like the talent deserved a more challenging script - or maybe the fact it was based on a true story meant it lacked the dramatic understructure that a work of fiction would have provided. John Travolta is a fine actor, able to create a part unselfconsciously and make it wholly believable; Salma Hayek was maybe miscast but carried it well and the supporting actors did well.It is certainly worth watching - I just wished it had been allowed to be a bit bigger given the ensemble and their talents.",Lonely Hearts

The other movie based on the same characters was made in 1970 and was much more intriguing. Yes the 1970 version had that ""B"" movie quality but you can't stop watching it anyway. Martha was played by the sensational, ugly and overweight Shirley Stoler. If nothing else watch the original to see her in action. The only thing the new version might have done better was the final conflict between Martha and Ray where Martha challenges him to choose. Selma was so miscast it is ridiculous and shows you how Hollywood can go so wrong in order to get a few more viewers in the seats. The role of Martha allows for some creative and amazing casting and they went with the typical Hollywood choice in Selma. Wake up Hollywood. Watch the original.",Lonely Hearts
45,scootmandutoo,An absolute disgrace of a film,2,6 September 2009,"Maybe if I hadn't seen ""The Honeymoon Killers,"" a film that actually tried to capture the essence of the real crime, I might have been more sympathetic.Maybe if I hadn't read about these crimes and saw the pictures of Martha Beck and knew how much her obesity motivated her jealousy, I might have accepted this garbage.But I did see the earlier film, and I do know the history of the crime, and this film is an absolute travesty and a joke.I love Salma Hayek, and she did her best with what she was given, but it is unforgivable to cast her as Martha Beck in this movie.To cast a beautiful, voluptuous actress in the role makes no sense whatsoever, and it shows that the director knew nothing about the material he was filming.But it gets worse...The entire subplot with John Travolta and Tony Soprano (who Gandolfini was playing here) was excruciating. It was a plot device that trivialized everything else in this film. What, the actual crime story wasn't riveting enough? And the killings? One would never know how long it took the lady who was hit with the hammer to die, or that Fernandez had to finish the job by strangling her. Want to see real true-to-life horror, watch this killing in ""The Honeymoon Killers,"" one of the most unsettling murders you will ever see on film.And the horror of what was done to the mother and daughter? See the earlier flick. Here, this is totally diluted by not showing the killing of the child, but having Travolta get physically ill when he discovers the body. If you are going to cover the subject, why hide from the most appalling thing that these 2 did? It didn't have to be graphic, but this flick totally copped out. Why was this even made? It was so much less honest, and less authentic than the earlier flick, which had it mostly right. This film was unnecessary and was butchered by a director who had no concept of the relevance of the crime he was supposed to be documenting.As I wrote, absolutely wretched.",Lonely Hearts

47,jp_011205,"Decent Film, Flawless Hayek",7,1 February 2007,"When a film features a cast with names like John Travolta, Laura Dern, Salma Hayek, & James Gandolfini you would expect it to be excellent wouldn't you? Unfortunately, this is not the case with Todd Robinson's, 'Lonely Hearts'. While it is decent, it's a shame to see so much potential wasted.'Lonely Hearts' depicts the story of Martha Beck, played by Salma Hayek, and Raymond Fernandez, played by Jared Leto. The duo are more commonly known as the Lonely Hearts Killers. They travel across the country scheming widows and spinsters out of their money. Once the two have their grasp on the unsuspecting women's fortune, they murder them and proceed onto the next target. As the duo start to become a bit sloppy on their route, detectives Robinson and Hildebrandt, played by Travolta and Gandolfini, begin to get closer to capturing them. As time passes it appears their killing spree just may be over.The cast named here is really good, at least on paper. I don't know what happened, but something went wrong here. There is absolutely no chemistry between Travolta and Dern. It's almost like they hate each other. Nicole Kidman would have been much more fitting choice to play the role of Rene. Her candidness could have added just the right element needed to make the on screen relationship work. The best acting exhibited here though is by the beautiful Salma Hayek. She is flawless as she exudes complete acrimoniousness and madness in her role as Martha Beck. It'll be no surprise to me if this time next year we hear her name among the buzz for an Oscar nod for best supporting actress.In addition to the mismatch of Travolta and Dern, director and writer Robinson further screws up what could have been with a partly repulsive script. Most of Ganfolfini's narratives are stagnant and repetitive. Of course, not much can be expected from Robinson taking into consideration his poor track record. Neither of his first two films, both documentaries, were successful.Never fear, all is not lost. Where Robinson fails in his screenplay, he makes up for it with his lovely directing. I would even go as far to say it's right on par with Alfonso Cuaron's amazing achievement, 'Children of Men'. So even despite it having a few weak points, I still recommend seeing 'Lonely Hearts' upon it's release to theaters this March.",Lonely Hearts
48,sfiver,Hiddden Gem Travolta,6,8 January 2010,"Rather surprised as I make a hobby of seeing as many movies as one human can master without getting paid for it. This film is a gem! I read some of the previous reviews and tend to agree with many of them in the fact that Travolta and/or Hayak did not attract any awards attentions - any at all. I realize it is a fictionalized version of a true crime(s) story. I have no interest in the real thing. I concentrate on the film presented and as is - it is superb. A nice, tight script and story about two crazed killers and the cops who pursue them. Travolta plays the homicide detective not ready to give up Gandolfini is his doubting partner just seeking his retirement checks. It is evident that Travolta's character, Detective Robinson, has recently lost his wife to suicide. This fact seemingly pushes him on his quest to further investigate what initially appears to be a suicide of a young woman. Detective Hilderbrandt, wonderfully underplayed by Gandolfini, attempts to persuade his partner otherwise. A series of events pushes the suicide and a recent murder closer in scope. The film follows the killers Ray Fernandez and Martha Beck on their malicious crime sprees. Beck is portrayed by the ultra-beautiful Selma Hayek. Her devotion to the character is a mixture of ugly anger and an uncanny concentration for the tasks at hand. Jared Leto as Ray Fernandez is completely believable as the understanding, somewhat debonair swindler of war widows. He hands in a good performance especially in his attempts to keep the jealous Martha under control. I can only guess this film was poorly marketed - hence the accolades went elsewhere. Don't miss it if you have the chance especially for Travolta's outstanding performance. 6/10 for acting and script.",Lonely Hearts
49,alan_v35,LA Confidential crossed with The Black Dahlia,6,13 September 2007,"With this star-studded cast, it's hard to believe that this movie went straight to video. Or did it just fly through the theater so fast that I missed it? I'm not sure, but either way, it deserved better. This is a decent period piece crime drama, in the Bonnie and Clyde vein, by writer/director Todd Robinson, who has a couple Emmy winning documentaries, under his belt, so tackling a true story as a drama seems to make sense. The whole cast gives strong performances and the story is not bad, though it seems to plod along at times.Lonely Hearts is a true story, set in the late 1940s. Jared Leto is Ray Fernandez, a slick conman pulling his marks from the lonely heart section of the newspaper, romancing them and then taking off with all of their cash. According to the film, his scumbag pattern only turns deadly after he meets Martha Beck (Salma Hayek), who begins to work with him, posing as his sister. Her jealousy, however, leads to her killing the women that Ray is romancing. Travolta's character, Elmer Robinson, becomes obsessed with busting Fernandez after one of his marks commits suicide, and he and his partner, Charles Hildebrandt (Gandolfini) are already on the robbing Romeo's tail when he hooks up with Beck.This one reminded me of LA Confidential crossed with The Black Dahlia, though it was better than the latter and not as good as the former. I often don't enjoy period pieces like this, but I found this one fairly engaging. The cop characters are kind of bland, but the murderous couple was very interesting and I was never sure what would happen next between them.

50,guitarcarl,Dramatized True Crime at it finest!,8,9 December 2006,"This is an excellent film. Filmed in a classic ""Film Noir"" style, it is both dark and engaging. The script is well written and expertly crafted. The pace is fluid and the characters are well developed.The score is appropriate and effective. It helps create tension and mood without becoming oppressive as many scores do.The cinematography is absolutely terrific and creates a dark and intimate view.All these elements combine to create an excellent environment for what is a truly inspiring cast. It would be difficult to overstate the quality performances of the entire cast. John Travolta was completely convincing as he always is but I think he may have surprised even his most supportive fans. He nailed the part hands down. In one scene he suspects a dead body is possibly hidden in a box and the mood he creates as he approaches and investigates the box is riveting.But the true star of this movie was without doubt Salma Hayek. She was mesmerizing as Martha Beck, a true masterpiece. She played evil so well it was spooky. Most people who watch this movie are going to really enjoy how carefully she seduces the viewer into her despotic plans. This is certainly one of her finest portrayals and shows she has considerable acting depth. A nasty ""femme fatale"" may not be a huge stretch for her but she really did a terrific job.""Lonely Hearts"" is not a family movie. There is plenty of blood, boobs and bad language. The movie deals with very heavy themes like suicide and child murder. And to make matters worse for young ones the story is true. Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez were real monsters and the movie shows more than enough to make that clear to anyone including kids.I am a big fan of true crime and this film is really great.

On the one hand, I can say I'm proud to live in the city where such a brilliantly directed and photographed film was made; on the other, this is a film I don't believe I ever need to watch again.The performances of all the principal players - particularly Travolta, Gandolfini, Dern, Leto and Hayek - are amazing, brilliant, utterly believable, etc. The set and costume design, and cinematography are by themselves worthy of at least Academy Award nominations. And the story (based on real events, although I'm sure much was fictionalized), is both riveting and repulsive.Salma Hayek stands out particularly for her portrayal of the seductive, depraved and sadistic Martha Beck, one half of the brutal ""Lonely Hearts"" killers. She should come with her own tag line, ""If looks could kill..."" Hayek's interpretation of this character is the polar opposite of Charlize Theron's in ""Monster,"" but no less effective. I'm thinking that if Ms. Theron's work in that film deserved an Oscar, then Ms. Hayek deserves no less for the amazing way she makes her ""beautiful butcher"" completely believable.Without spoiling the plot, let me just provide this advisory. If brutal, bloody murders, suicides, explicit (non-erotic) sexuality, and the constant dropping of the ""F-bomb"" - not in a sexual way - are not your thing, then you may want to skip this film. It's not a date movie or a chick flick by any means, despite the romantic come-on in the title. The film is almost completely devoid of humor; humor would seem inappropriate in this context.Although justice is apparently served - this is revealed at the very beginning of the film - no one will walk away from this film feeling very uplifted by what they will have just seen.",Lonely Hearts

54,betaworld2046,A movie confused by its focus,5,2 September 2017,"It is a beautiful movie, all the scenes shot very nicely. But the reason I would not recommend it is because the movie has no clear focus.The focus of this film, which was split between Buster and the couples half-and-half, should have been solely on Ray and Martha instead, who would have had the chance to make the film a lot more twisted, gruesome and action-packed..., the sort of things you would expect in a serial killer movie. The movie-rated ""R"" anyway-is a lot cleaner than I thought. The most gruesome scene is probably the blood gushing out of the woman who was shot by Martha in a furry while she was riding on Ray having sex. That is all. I guess if there was additional 20 mins scenes shot on the killer couples and their preys, we would have the chance to look deeper into their twisted mind and the manic killing spree. Instead, the film spent a lot of precious time on Buster. If there was a good story about him, it would have been different. But it was none. Buster's wife died at the beginning, shooting her brain out in a bathtub. The scene was a lot like the later one, where Ray's victim committing a suicide because she caught him having sex with Martha. So I naturally thought there was some connection between Buster's wife and Ray. I waited until the last minute expecting to see it revealed, but nothing. The director did not give any explanation about Buster's wife's suicide, which basically devalued the starting scene-there was nothing in the end to echo the beginning. Then it was Buster's personal life: his son, his mom, Rene... has not much to do with neither the killing nor the detection. So does anybody care except the director, who is actually a descendant of real Buster?In the end, I was puzzled why Laura Dern joined this film. She was David Lynch's favorite leading actress. She looked like an angel in Blue Velvet. She was so skillful in Inland Empire. Then she played Rene, who was not important what so ever. I mean, Laura tried to show the different aspect of this woman, her harshness in the office, her tenderness in bed with Buster, her self-respect... All the effort was wasted again, when it came to the end scene, where it had no time to explain her reunion with Buster. There should have been some good emotional scenes.Even though the shooting was done beautifully, the storyline was planned very poorly. I can't say I enjoyed watching it.",Lonely Hearts
55,ramayana,"Far from flawless, but still among the best",6,7 December 2007,"OK, it's been a while I saw a movie with a similarly stunning start. After the suicide scene I just said ""wow"" and waited for a movie keeping up this high level of suspense. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the later parts. The true story of the two killers is so dark with its blend of sexual perversions, voodoo magic and cold-blooded murder, it has potential for a really memorable epic (Natural Born Killers and Angelheart come to mind). What we got instead is beautifully shot and aptly directed melodrama with cheesy dialogs. The actors are highly praised by others, but let's be honest here, there's only cliché characters in this movie. Travolta does have a strong presence but lacks depth because his character, which was supposed to be the lead element, is badly underwritten. Salma is gorgeous and has a moments that gave me goose-skin but, together with Leto, she fails to provide the dramatic skills needed in the most climactic scene (when arguing with Leto to kill Delphine). I was almost bored by their lines and just waited for him to make up his mind at last so that she shuts up. And being a true story, I don't think the late Mr Robinson would like this film. In reality, both of them were disgusting both by character and appearance (especially the real Martha who was rather ugly and so fat she could barely squeeze herself into the electric chair). However, the movie almost makes them into romantic heroes, or at least respectable people, with all this stuff about true love and Martha's very human obsession with having a child. BTW, she did have a child before she met Martin, who she abandoned for the man's sake - so much about historical accuracy. OK its fictionalized but question is, is it ethical to turn two perverted killers into demi-heroes for the sake of romance and dedicate the movie to the prosecutor who brought them to justice? Anyway, with all this said and with all its flaws, photography and directing make Lonely Hearts one of the best movies Hollywood has produced recently. It's a movie you won't easily forget.",Lonely Hearts
56,Naneaux,This movie ends up being about wigs,4,1 October 2007,"I was eager to see this thriller because of all the A-List talent in the cast. But what a crushing disappointment. The script was dull because we are TOLD everything but SHOWN relatively little... and then Gandolfini's voice-over a) kept jerking me into 21st century New Jersey (it's just too identifiable a voice) and b) stole a lot of Travolta's thunder because it became Gandolfini's story, even when it was supposed to be Travolta's. And then, tragically, I got distracted by the actors' hair-- and how wretchedly phony every toupee and wiglet looked (on Gandolfini, on Travolta, on Leto and others) and how emotional reactions were underscored-- not with great lines or indelible images-- but by pulling a forelock out of place, which made said fake hair even more fake-looking. In the end, not even Salma Hayek's ferocious sexuality could salvage this turkey. It's just not good enough. Don't waste your time.",Lonely Hearts
57,hiroyukiwu,leto shines,7,4 December 2006,"two detectives, 'buster'Elmer C. Robinson (travolta) and Charles Hildebrandt (gandolfini) hunt two killers Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez played by salma hayek and jared leto.basically the story is of two policemen chasing after two killers who, by posing as a single man and sister, enlist in finding their victims through the lonely hearts columns within newspapers and magazines.on the acting side we'll start with the policemen first, travolta as essentially the lead cop in this movie is a somewhat torn man in his duty as a cop and in the loss of his wife, travolta soon finds a new lease,to speak of, by trying to capture the two killers, he is helped in this matter by gandolfini as his straight thinking,talking friend, but though the acting between the two is of an OK standing (gandolfini coming off stronger) the pairing doesn't come off as one would hope and it is slightly stale, more so within their dialog together.the hunted pair,hayek and leto, have a better chemistry, despite what many have seen of hayek in this film, being wooden and poorly acted out, i'd give her a little more credit than the naysayers, mainly because the person she is portraying is of that type of person, soulless and wholeheartedly callous. her dominance shows through in her interpretation of a jealous and highly possessive person. but the real star who shines in this movie is leto, from his smile right down to the unsteadiness of his actions, movements,gestures are perfect and really shows us what his is capable of, could well be we are witnessing him in his prime, his ending is very well shot (credit to the director there, Todd Robinson).a long and somewhat violent film, yet it leaves enough subject for conversation and reply value. in terms of what director robinson has achieve,well thats not much, mainly a wasted cast on a somewhat unfair choice in director (The director's grandfather was Elmer C. Robinson, the cop who investigated the Lonely Hearts murders). but still a film to watch.",Lonely Hearts
58,irajoelirajoel,lonely,3,29 September 2007,"Possible Spoilers. This is the 3rd version of the Lonely Hearts serial killers saga. Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck were two sickos who murdered many women during the 1940's and were finally caught and executed in 1949. Although not without interest the other two accounts of this creepy grim tale, The Honeymoon Killers and the Mexican film Deep Crimson are much better. This time around the story is seen mostly from the point of view of the detectives who were investigating the crimes and they are played by John Travolta and James Gandolfini both of who wear terrible toupees that really take away from their performances. In a film that has rather nice production values, I don't understand why more attention was not paid to their hair pieces. The killers are played by this time by Jared Leto and to my mind a very miscast Salma Hayek. The real Martha Beck was an unattractive overweight horror and I don't really understand why they cast a beautiful woman like Hayek in the role. Maybe it was a bit of perversion on the part of the screenwriter-director. Anyway this choice of casting takes away from the grimness of the story. Leto was a better choice as Raymond Fernandez, but if you want to see two really great performances check out Regina Orozco in Deep Crimson and Shirley Stoller in The Honeymoon Killers.",Lonely Hearts

But, there's nothing going on here. It offers nothing fresh on the idea of crime, criminals, police and all too often relies on clichés and hackneyed incantations of scenes we've seen a thousand times. ****CHARACTER SPOILER**** BELOW **** NOT STORY SPOILER, THOUGH.....For a movie that has a toupee play a pretty big part in a star's character (Leto), they really should have done a lot better job hiding the hair pieces worn by the other two male leads - Travolta and Tony Soprano. I mean, dang. Travolta's hair piece is the wrong color and Tony Soprano's is sticking out in profile in every shot. Really hack movie all around. Even the B-story between Travolta and his family had little to do with anything. But, it did look pretty good. Especially when compared with the other two movies I saw this week.",Lonely Hearts

Travolta in the lead was great,his best role since Pulp Fiction. James Gandolfini shows promise as an actor and he is great. His role shows him as one of the guys unlike his role as Tony Soprano. Heyek is the real standout. Salma Heyek brings the evil out of the character,but at the end you feel terrible for. Jared Leto was the best of the four. A rising star. And only adding Scott Caan was plus.Lonely Hearts show the audience that we don't need a star studded cast to watch a great movie. The movie was rightly casted.

Selma hayek is pretty evil in a seductive way she wants what she wants when she wants it or else... also it was a pretty good job by john travolta most of the movie he is depressed and he acts like it and technically you can feel his pain throughout the movie... although the content of the film is very disturbing and you will know what i mean once you watch it or if you have viewed it already... cant see how anyone could go through that w/o a form of remorse... but either way great cast, great movie don't watch if you have a weak stomach, but those of you that do enjoy this bittersweet film",Lonely Hearts

The direction is really bad, which makes the movie long and dull. Some other good director could have made an very good movie out of this quite interesting story, but not Todd Robinson. Salma Hayek isn't getting any younger, and Jared Leto is a bit too creepy. To sum up, the cast is good, Robinson's direction is annoying, but the original story was good, which makes it even more disappointing...

It held my interest from start to finish - and the finish was satisfying. Gandolfini and Travolta were excellent as you would and should expect. Salma Hayek gave what I think should be an award winning performance. Jared Leto was also superb... I can't say I've noticed him in anything of note before this.

67,jamesmarlas,wasting a great cast,3,2 June 2006,"I went to the opening in the Jacksonville Film Festival. this was the most over-hyped movie in the festival and by a large amount the worst of the 10 that I saw.Based on the true crime story of a couple of cops (John Travolta and James Gandolfini) in the 1940s who arrest Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck ""the Lonely Heart Killers"" n (The serial killers sought out their victims in the newspaper personals) The film goes back and forth between the serial killers catching and killing their pray and the cops.What disturbed me most about this film was Selma Hayeks unbelievably inexpressive acting. She was as blank and unbelievable as they come. You'd swear she was reading her lines from a cue card.All in all the film failed to engage me at all and the serial killer blood scenes seemed completely gratuitous. Just a way to keep our attention in a movie that seemed way way longer than it is. The director botched on this one and failed in showcasing an extreme wealth of talented actors.",Lonely Hearts
68,RiverCollins,"Beautifully filmed, directed and acted; but not much else to enjoy.",5,16 April 2007,"Within two minutes of starting this movie it became clear that it was very well put together. Excellent cinematography and costume design.I'm not sure exactly what it was that disappointed me so much. It could have been the lack of drama. I didn't feel like the plot escaladed to a climax. I understand that this is based on a true story, but it certainly could have been done in a more dramatic way; especially during certain parts of the chase.The acting was excellent on all parts. In agreement with everyone else, Salma Hayek was a stand-out. However, I feel that Jared Leto (who plays Ray Fernandez) was miss-cast. I think that's the part that prevented me from enjoying this movie the most. I was excited to see this because I am a HUGE Jared Leto fan, and I've always loved the films he's been in, and he's always become one with his character (e.g. his role as Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream). Although his acting was excellent as always, I just couldn't buy it. As I watched his character evolve I felt more and more conflicted between the good-hearted vulnerability I felt from him (perhaps as a result of watching countless interviews of him), and the bad-hearted almost monster-like character he was meant to be portraying. I just couldn't buy him as a sleaze-bag . In Chapter 27 he portrayed a psychotic man so well you forgot it was Jared right from the get-go, so I know it wasn't his acting that got in the way.On top of that, I felt that Leto and Hayek didn't make a good on-screen couple. He seemed small in comparison to her. This was a couple that worked together to lure in rich folks; I wanted them to seduce me. Instead I was repelled by them, even in the scenes where they are ""sucking in"" new prey. I felt that they looked, and even acted, awkward together.In summary, heightened drama and a more befitting Ray Fernandez would have made this an excellent film.",Lonely Hearts

""Lonley Hearts"" is difficult to recognize as the same story for several reasons. The character played by Hayek in real life was a tall six foot ogreish woman from Alabama; the diminutive Hayek with her Hispanic accent is off key. As a love obsessed woman She seemed to be channeling Frida Kahlo all over again. Also being filmed in color with many scenes in broad daylight somehow distracted from the 'noire' atmosphere. As a work in it own right it survives passably.The overall product was enjoyable. True crime buffs will like the added details of the killings missing from ""Honeymoon Killers.""

These people did some very awful things and I think that it's a little sad that we are here judging the movie when people have died by the hands of these ""lonely hearts"". Personally I blame Martha for the sick turn of events (based on the movie of course). John and James keep with the feel and it's nice to see a back story to the movie instead of just murders and crooks. Both sides gives you a look into the minds (as twisted as they may be) of the couple and the detectives trying to catch them. I'm glad that Johns character and son finally finds peace in the end.

71,stevenkandola,Style...with the Substance!,10,7 April 2007,"Synopsis: Based on actual events that occurred in the 1940s, this film noir centres around the chase of two money stealing serial killers, Raymond Fernandez (Jared Leto) and Martha Beck (Salma Hayek). The chase begins when two New York detectives, Charles Hildebrandt (James Gandolfini) and Elmer C. Robinson (John Travolta) come across a suspicious murder, and through a hunch of detective Robinsons, the investigation leads them to the trail of Beck and Martha. Before Martha entered the picture (or should we say ad), Beck was a singleton who answered the emotionally foiled ads of widowers and vulnerable women - via the 'lonely hearts' column. This was his little black book to an easy fortune. Thinking he was the 'Don Juan', the balding Latin lover seduced his way through countless women, robbing them of their life savings, without any empathy...until that is, when he came across Martha. Described in the narrative as 'damaged goods', Martha instantly catched onto Beck's polygamous routine, but her reaction was anything other than sickened. Both being like minded and sexually sordid, they joined forces and became known as the 'Lonely Hearts Killers'. One of the most notorious serial killers in history. From here on, the story unravels into a cat and mouse game, always leaving Robinson and Hildebrandt a step behind their killers. But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end, and eventually they are caught, and sentenced for execution, on the account of 12 confessed murders.My thoughts: From the moment i pressed play, i knew this movie was going to be stylistically directed, but as it was a remake and the director was an unknown, i remained quite reserved until half way through. Todd Robinson has done justice to what is a personal film to him, as Elmer C. Robinson was his grandfather. Although not as historically correct as could have been, the film manages to engage you to the end. The ending is somewhat Hollywood tinged, but this in no way detracts from the film's achievements...that is of cinematography and acting.Lately, it seems that John Travolta acts best in moody roles, such as the one he did in 'A Love Song For Bobby'. His character in 'Lonely Hearts' is always on show, and the death of his wife broods over him like a bad smell. His trademark glare is ever present, and as expected, gives a performance suited to the film's genre.In any film i see James Gandolfini in, i always see Tony Soprano, but maybe thats because he can't help but act the way he really is...which is a testament to him as a good actor. The only exception from this is in 'Romance & Cigarettes', in which you have the delight in hearing him sing! None the less, he adds some well deserved humour to the film, and towards the end, you see a more softer side of him.The first time i saw Jared Leto was in Fight Club as the ass licking blondie, and it was evident that this guy had talent. Although he still seems underrated and under used, his commitment as an actor is ever present. He recently gained 62 lbs for his new movie 'Chapter 27', and then was diagnosed with gout after dramatically losing it. Regarding his performance in 'Lonely Hearts', he was more than adequate and played his character with a somewhat over the top comedic twist.Salma Hayek also gives a good performance, but seems wrongly cast, as the real character she is playing was 'ugly' and it was this jealousy towards other beautiful girls that made her the way she was, especially when they would fall for her partner in crime, Beck. Other than the miscasting, she played it well and strong, so much so, people thought she deserved an Oscar...but not me.The violence in the movie is very strong and bloody, but appear very few times in the film. Something which give the film more credibility. Along with this, the film noir narrative and look is spot on...adding to the 1940's experience.",Lonely Hearts

73,lifestandstillhere,two star-crossed lethal lovers lead cops on a chase for personal and legal justice,9,19 January 2007,"minimal spoilers ahead. . .A lovely new friend from across the pond sent me a copy of Lonely Hearts. I got it today, popped it in, and was instantly swept up. Let's start with the cast: Gandolfini, Travolta, Leto, Hayek, Dern, Caan. Let's also get this out of the way: I'm a sucker for these kinds of films. Dirty, bloody, gritty, serial killings, naughty sex. Who could possibly want more? Dancing penguins? Talking cars? NASCAR parodies? Please.And, yeah, it's pretty clear from the beginning that Leto has chosen yet another role where he'll assuredly be mutilated by the end, where peril is ever eminent and, this time, well-deserved. He's ten miles of bad road, and word on the street is that he sat for hours getting the hairs plucked out of his scalp only to don a ridiculous toupee--mucking up the beauty that has to be, at this point, an utter curse. And, again, he looks so pretty being so bad.Jesus, where are the accolades for this guy? How tragicomic to be always Jordan Catalano when you have been nothing like that for over a decade. I'd wear eyeliner and sing emo too if I were him. Because it's a damn crying shame that this guy doesn't have an Oscar to sit next to that well-deserved Moon Man.Reviews are sketchy for this one, citing the Travolta curse (I thought Costner was the only one who had one of those) and the unfortunate reprisal of Tony Soprano's lumber and voice from Jim. But when it comes to Leto's performance, most are in agreement: chilling, sexy, lotharian. And Hayek? She is red death in high heels and stockings, Leto's Ray's ""kitty cat"" sharpening her razor claws on a world that refuses to give her catnip.Can't wait until this comes out in the states. My computer screen does the gorgeous yet murderous red little justice. The big screen will most assuredly do that for me. And for Leto. Again. I hope someone takes notice.",Lonely Hearts

One thing that makes this film so great is that it was written by the grandson of the 'Buster' Robinson, the detective (Travolta) that caught Ray Fernandez and Martha Beck (the Lonely Hearts killers) in 1949. The script is well written and the actors really are phenomenal, but I must admit that John Travolta's presence, although compelling, really dragged on a lot... I can see why he chose John Travolta to portray his grandfather, but I must admit that his acting on this particular movie just wasn't appealing to me. Scott Caan did a wonderful job in what scenes he was in, bringing a bit of smug comedy to this, otherwise, drawn out movie. I admit that at times it seemed rather long and the voice over made it quite annoying and boring, having to strain, at times, to hear the actual dialogue; once you get past that, though, the story is very compelling, Leto and Hayeck did a wonderful job of grasping onto what made Ray and Martha who they were and becoming it.I would definitely advise you to see it if you are a fan of true crime.",Lonely Hearts

Selma delivers a performance of a lifetime and although comparison's to Charlize Therons Monster can be drawn it would be a shame to think that it would be so.Miss Hayek glues you to the screen as her powerful performance shatters any pre conceived ideas one might have about female killers. Those stunning eyes becomes an absolute mirror of hate and evil and what makes this so powerful is that even in all that bloodshed and pure undiluted horror one can see the very vulnerable need of the character to be loved.If Selma Hayek is not nominated and does not win an academy award for this work then there is no God.,Lonely Hearts

It is a really well made film. The score was great also. From 1-10 I give the film and 8.The Acting: Travolta, Gandolfino, Leto and Dern are good....However is Salma Hayek who steals the show. Her performance is like taken from a Film Noir of the 40s. She is volatile, sadistic and evil conniving femme fatale. She scores the best performance by far. Her lines are great and she looks stunning. You actually forget she is Salma Hayek. She becomes one with her character.My Prediction: Salma Hayek will score an Oscar Nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her compelling and superb performance.Salma gives a career changing performance. You forget she is the same actress that worked in such films as Wild Wild West and Bandidas. In the Lonely Hearts, she is glamorous. She is truly a ""femme fatale."" Her character is trying to find happiness, however she is looking for it in the wrong places. From the beginning, Salma Hayek's Martha Beck is powerful, complicated, passionate and SICK!

Best Lines: Martha: Has Anybody Ever Loved You that Much Detective? Martha: To Kill or Die....For YouIn this scene she already has been captured and in being interrogated.

The woman, in reality, was homely and heavy set. She hated beautiful women. Her homely looks were the driving force behind her taking out lonely hearts ads, her desperation to please and all her behavior and crimes. Casting her as a bombshell who can get any man she wants makes even less sense then it normally does in these movies.

84,msampp,Lousy,1,5 November 2006,"This film had a lot of problems. First, the script was chock-full of cop film clichés. Travoltas obsessed cop kind of trafficked in every thing we know about obsessed cops that we have learned from the movies. This film attempts to have it both ways with racism. The short racist cop engages in the kind of ultra-offensive button-pushing that we are expected to be comfortable with in the post-modern world. You've really got to be a writer with the moral weight of a James Ellroy to pull it off though. Gandolfini and Travolta punish the little racist over and over, and save a dying black man who is lying in the gutter, maybe the only black man in the film. So G and T are the white knights, good guy cops in a racist world. This is a load of horse-crap, and it's an attempt to butter up the audience. This maidenish attitude is undermined again by the brutal, offhand violence and cartooned, ugly sex. The broad burlesque of the violence is revolting and strikes an odd key. The total effect of the combination of comic sex and explicit gruesome death is a kind of disgust for human life. This is pretty sad and anti-human territory.The performances are mixed. Travolta is o.k., Gandolfini great, Leto is good, and Hayek is awful. She delivers this pouting femme fa tale performance as Martha that is totally at odds with who this psychopathic killer was. Her performance was either jokey or flat at all times. The photography and visual look of this film is excellent, muted and cold. But the mixed bag of storytelling styles combined with the brutal comic violence and bad acting undermines everything that it has going for it.I watched a half dozen grannies walk out of this film, and that made me sit there and think about my grandmother for about ten minutes, as I waited for the movie to get better. I finally walked out. I was nauseous, and stayed that way for a while.",Lonely Hearts
