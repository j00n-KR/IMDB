0,MartinHafer,About as good as the 1938 film,8,17 March 2009,"I've seen MY FAIR LADY several times. However, it wasn't until last night that I finally saw the 1938 version of PYGMALION and this was very interesting indeed. It seems that MY FAIR LADY is actually NOT based on the George Bernard Shaw play as much as it's based on the Leslie Howard movie. That's because the dialog (particularly Henry Higgins') is often word-for-word that of the film. Additionally, both films have the same ending--one that is NOT the same as the original play. In the play, the ending was more sad but also much more realistic and consistent with the characters and their growth (or lack thereof in the case of Henry Higgins).Quality-wise, both films are superb and I enjoyed them immensely. One very obvious difference is that MY FAIR LADY is a musical with lovely songs, so it's a much longer movie. Another is that although Leslie Howard did a very fine job, somehow Rex Harrison came off as grouchier and more entertaining in the lead. Another major difference is that MY FAIR LADY feels more like a comedy and PYGMALION feels much more sad and deeper emotionally. Because it is a bright and colorful musical, the characters in MY FAIR LADY seem a bit less real, but with PYGMALION you are almost brought to tears late in the film.My recommendation is that you see them both. Both are exquisitely produced and acted and you can't go wrong with either one. I could say more in my review about this film, but considering that there are already a zillion other reviews, I'll end it here.UPDATE--Only days after posting this review, I got quite a few ""not helpfuls"". I assume this is from fans who adored this 1964 film. Well, my response is that it can't merit anything more than an 8 because the dialog was directly lifted from the earlier film AND so much of the singing was NOT done by the stars themselves. To me, these are flaws that prevent the film from earning a higher score. And, while I think about it, cannot justify the many 10s I see for the film.",My Fair Lady
1,TheLittleSongbird,"An enchanting musical, that is a joy to the eyes as well as to the ears.",10,13 July 2009,"My Fair Lady, loosely based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalian was a film I saw recently, and I absolutely loved it, and I am 17. It wasn't just the acting, but also the overall look of the film and the music. Mind you, I saw the restored version.The film looks exquisite, with stunning sets and truly luscious costumes. A prime example is the ballroom scene. Audrey Hepburn's dresses were also a marvel to look at. This was also helped by the superb cinematography, and the detailed direction, provided by George Cukor. The scene at the racetrack was one of my personal favourite scenes from the film. Oh, and the choreography is fabulous.The script is witty and acerbic, with excellent scenes with the social commentary. The story is simple, but is well told, and fits the lengthy running time perfectly.The music by Frederick Loewe is just outstanding. Asides from the costumes, the songs are ones that you hear once and never forget. Songs like I Could Have danced All Night, With a Little bit of Luck, Just You wait, Why Can't A Woman Be More Like A Man? and Wouldn't it be Loverly linger long into the memory, and are a joy to the ear. I loved the incidental music at the beginning, then again I am the sort of person who is raised on classical music, and appreciates music for what it is.The performances also added a lot to the film; Rex Harrison was just superb as the cynical, misanthropic Professor Henry Higgins, who transforms Eliza Doolittle to the woman she is at the end of the film. The Belgian actress Audrey Hepburn is perfectly enchanting as Eliza, and Marnie Nixon provides her singing voice beautifully.(yes she was dubbed, and Audrey Hepburn is not a slut) There is solid support from Stanley Holloway and Gladys Cooper, and watch out for Sherlock Holmes actor Jeremy Brett as Freddy.In conclusion, a truly beautiful film, that deserved all the praise it got, it is an amazing film, that is misunderstood. It is also a perfect treat for around Easter time. Honestly, for those who think it is the worst movie ever made, see something like Home Alone 4, the only film I can think of that deserves a minus rating, that's how terrible that film is. My Fair Lady gets a 10/10 from me, Bethany Cox.",My Fair Lady
2,bkoganbing,Enchantment Pours From This Wonderful Score,9,15 October 2007,"The only complaint I have about My Fair Lady is that in their infinite wisdom the Brothers Warner decided that Julie Andrews could not repeat her performance of Eliza Doolittle from Broadway. Otherwise you have to go some to criticize this film because everything else about it is so right.I still remember the controversy over signing Audrey Hepburn for the female lead. Warner Brothers was going to sign Cary Grant for the role of Henry Higgins and James Cagney for Alfred P. Doolittle. Though that would have been an interesting film, Cagney was committed to retirement and Grant loudly and publicly refused the part and said they were crazy to sign anyone, but Rex Harrison. So Harrison and Stanley Holloway were the only ones to repeat their parts from Broadway. Poor Julie Andrews had no one speaking up so publicly for her.It was the old story of a proved movie name for box office, even though Andrews had broken into film with The Americanization of Emily and was well received. I always marveled at Julie's singing of Eliza Doolittle's part, how she held those high notes and a cockney accent at the same time in Wouldn't It Be Loverly. Marni Nixon who had dubbed Deborah Kerr in The King and I and Natalie Wood in West Side Story did the honors for Hepburn's singing voice. My Fair Lady as we all know is based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion and for Shavian purists who want his social commentary, I recommend seeing Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller in the film version of Pygmalion. Probably Shaw would not have liked the emphasis on romance that My Fair Lady has, but I'm betting he would have liked the score that Alfred Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe. I can't recall anyone who doesn't like it.The songs both fit the plot situations and some stand on their own to become major hits. I Could Have Danced All Night which Hepburn/Nixon sings to express her breakthrough with the cultured speech that Harrison is teaching the cockney flower girl is almost an anthem for anyone who has unparalleled good time or achievement. I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face which Harrison talk/sings in his fashion is a great song about all the emotions one feels at a special someone's abrupt departure.But My Fair Lady's biggest hit is On the Street Where You Live sung by the minor character of Freddy Eynsford-Hill who is Harrison's rival for Hepburn. In the film he's played by a dubbed Jeremy Brett in the singing department by Bill Shirley. Shirley some might remember appeared in some minor musicals for in the Forties and Fifties and is best remembered for a pleasant tenor voice singing some forgettable songs in Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd.I remember well in 1957 On the Street Where You Live on every pop station several times a day by any number of singers, the biggest hit version by Vic Damone. It's one of the most romantic songs ever written about the first blush of love. You get a towering feeling indeed when you hear that lyric sung.The two repeaters from Broadway, Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway, took home the Oscar gold for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. And Director George Cukor won his only Oscar for Best Director. Cukor in all the years of the great Hollywood studio system when he turned out classic after classic for MGM, admittedly wanted the Oscar to cap his career. He frankly admitted campaigning for it like a politician, but it paid off. And of course it was the Best Picture of 1964.And the winner of the Best Actress, Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins. Audrey Hepburn wasn't even nominated. I can't complain about her performance, but many felt Andrews should have acted AND sung the part as well. Still don't miss this absobloominutely loverly musical.",My Fair Lady
3,Leofwine_draca,Amiable enough,6,16 September 2021,"Not a bad version of the Shaw play but I've seen the stage musical and it felt a lot better. Hepburn is playing one of those perfectly 'wholesome' characters who gets on my nerves a little and as ever there's something a bit off about Harrison. But the trappings are good and the songs are decent, so it's amiable enough.",My Fair Lady
4,SnoopyStyle,Great fun with adorable Hepburn,8,23 August 2014,"Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is a pompous brilliant linguist who boasts that he could turn cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady in 6 months. She's hounded by her drunken father (Stanley Holloway) for money. She wants to have lessons from Higgins and Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) makes a bet with him.This is a fun musical. As with some musicals of that era, Hepburn's singing is dubbed. No one would dare do that today, but one must not dismiss this movie for doing it back in the day. Hepburn plays the role older. It would help to play up her age. Her older age only helps to create chemistry between her and Harrison. Hepburn is as always very adorable. She is a brilliant comic actress. She and Rex Harrison are great foils for each other. This is a good funny acting duo.",My Fair Lady
5,Hitchcoc,What Can I Say?,10,21 September 2001,"I don't know how much I can add to this. The musical stands alone, as far as I'm concerned, so it puts a lot of pressure on the director, George Cukor, one of the greatest, to complement it. This is a lot to ask. I love this movie. I never got a chance to see the Broadway cast (I was four when it opened), but I have never been disappointed. The production numbers are grand, the byplay between the smug, offensive Higgins and Eliza is precious (my favorite song is ""Just You Wait, Henry Higgins""). I've always been intrigued how Freddy never even has a chance (I can't watch those wonderful Sherlock Holmes episodes without imagining the grim visage of Jeremy Brett singing ""On the Street Where You Live.""). The one thing that made an impression on me, though some may see it as a criticism, is how ""clean"" everything is. There is no doubt in my mind that Cukor was elevating not only the dialogue but the visual images. It's probably not fair to like a movie because you like looking at an actress, but Audrey Hepburn glows in her Eliza, and I don't care if she is or was a street girl, she is the magical rose on the landscape before she ever meets Higgins. The business about who sings the songs is of no significance to me. This is a movie, not the Broadway show, so the images and sounds are melded and presented. Knowing that Audrey Hepburn has a beautiful voice makes it moot as well. I don't know if she could carry the picture or not--maybe not, but it doesn't concern me. When I first saw Stanley Holloway, there was something about him that grated on me (too many performances on the Ed Sullivan Show). He grated on me as Eliza's father. Now, every time I see this film, I thoroughly enjoy him and I really like the comedic qualities of his song. I love how he and his cronies cavort around London with total disregard for their base roots. I could go on, but I really like this film because it is filled with class: George Bernard Shaw filtered through George Cukor. Not bad!",My Fair Lady
6,mark.waltz,Old-fashioned musical comedy has never been so wonderful.,10,21 October 2013,"Some straight plays cry for music. ""Green Grows the Lilacs"", ""The Matchmaker"", ""Auntie Mame"". And for George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmallion"", all it took was the ingenuity of Moss Hart to get together with Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Lowe to create a classic Broadway musical that not only ran for years but began several long-running touring companies and created a legendary film that is absolutely perfect in structure even if slightly overlong and featuring a leading lady some say was not right for the ingénue role.I disagree when it comes to the presence of Audrey Hepburn in this part. Yes, Julie Andrews had what it took on Broadway not to only be the messy looking flower girl but the great lady in beautiful gowns as well. She also had the windpipes to belt out such classics as ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"" and ""I Could Have Danced All Night"". Jack Warner obviously didn't want to take the chance on an unknown (even though she really wasn't unknown; She was popular for TV and theater, having played Guenevere in ""Camelot"") so Audrey Hepburn was cast. Envisioned by audiences and critics as too glamorous for the rags she wore while selling flowers, she didn't get the praise she deserved, even if those same audiences and critics did go ""ooh"" and ""ah!"" when she stepped down the stairs in her glamorous outfits for the Ascot Gavotte and the later ball sequence.Rex Harrison does repeat his role as the very ego-maniacal Henry Higgins, the eternal teacher of language who bets his pal Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde White) that he can turn a flower girl into a duchess. It takes lots of chocolates and marbles being swallowed before Eliza (Hepburn) can be presented to London society where she meets Higgins' aristocratic but kind mother (Gladys Cooper). Eliza bedazzles society with her earthiness, especially Freddie Eynsford Hill (Jeremy Brett) who of sings his love for her in the breathtaking ""On the Street Where You Live"". But can Eliza escape from her past, especially when she keeps running into her blaggard father Alfred (the wonderful Stanley Holloway) who first sings of ""With a Little Bit of Luck"" as he avoids work, cops, and getting married. That last part of course, changes when he announces he's ""Getting Married in the Morning"". The extremely heavy set woman Holloway dances with in this big production number is none other than Ayllene Gibbons, the bed-ridden mother who devours a whole turkey in the cult classic ""The Loved One"". This film is jam-packed with moments of greatness, from the rose-filled opening credits and that fabulous overture, the delightfully campy ""Ascot Gavotte"" (two wealthy matrons eying each other when each of them shows up in the same ""original""), the presence of Higgins' former student (Theodore Bikel) who ""exposes"" Eliza as a ""fraud"", and finally the show-down between Higgins and Eliza after he has exploited her and the venomous ""Without You"" that leads to her declaring to him that ""you shall never see me again"".Yes, there's something about Higgins that makes him a male chauvinist pig, but there's also something very gentle and tender about him, even if he is adverse to showing it. You can see men like this existing in this time and sure in their ego of who they are and how they lived their life. All Eliza wanted was the chance to become a lady and work in a real flower shop rather than sell them on the street, so no gold digger is she. Mona Washbourne plays housekeeper Mrs. Pearce with a loving yet imperious character who finally stands up for Eliza, and Gladys Cooper is noble yet not without spunk as Higgins' moral but outspoken mother. Sharp-eyed classic film fans will recognize Isobel Elsom as Freddie's mother, remembering her with glee as the matron murdered by Ida Lupino and her sisters in ""Ladies in Retirement"" 23 years before.Artistically, musically and technically speaking, this is outstanding on every level. It is one of those films one must try to see on a big screen during one's lifetime, and with its 50th anniversary coming up, a big-screen re-release is certainly not a bad idea. Director George Cukor finally won his long-awaited Oscar for this, and while Audrey Hepburn failed to be nominated (in a year where Julie Andrews won for ""Mary Poppins""), her contributions to the film cannot be ignored, either. Some may quibble that Marni Nixon's dubbing of Hepburn too quickly looses its cockney accent when, after declaring ""The Rain in Spain Stays Mainly in the Plain"" she begins to sing of ""Dancing All Night"" with narry an ""aye"" or ""garn"" in earshot, but when you've got all this other brilliance, why care?",My Fair Lady
7,claudio_carvalho,A Too Long and Fancy Musical Version of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion,9,9 February 2004,"Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is an arrogant bachelor professor of phonetics who bets with his rich friend Colonel George Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that he is able to transform the accent of the simple low class seller of flowers Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) in a British accent that would make people believe that she belongs to the high class. This musical is a too long and fancy version of Bernard Shaw's `Pygmalion'. Although being a lovely movie, winner of eight Oscars, the 1938 version, with Lesley Howard and Wendy Hiller is a much better film. Rex Harrison has a good performance, but Leslie Howard has had also in the same level, if not better than Rex's. The marvelous Audrey Hepburn is not adequate for this role. Wendy Hiller has had a better and better performance as Eliza. First, who might believe on Audrey Hepburn as a simple and ignorant street vendor selling flowers? Second, after her transformation, which man would ignore her beauty? There are some good songs, others are very boring. And they break the rhythm of the story, and make this film very long (170 min.). Further, there are too much participation of Eliza's father in this version, singing shallow and boring songs. The 1938 is more talkative and theatrical, but much better, with a very tight screenplay. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Minha Bela Dama' (`My Beautiful Lady')",My Fair Lady
8,kosmasp,Abominate,5,7 July 2007,"Rex Harrisons character is. And it's also one of the musicals, that I can't watch/hear. I'm not a special musical fan to begin with, but this didn't convince me either to like it. And although I do like Rex Harrison, his character behavior makes you wonder, how anyone would/could like this guy? Especially a fine woman (or should I say a fair Lady), as in this movie? But then again it's only a movie, some would argue. But I'm pretty stunned by the fact, that even women like this movie, because although another user made a few good points, about the Rex Harrison character not being a misogynist, but a misanthrope, the overall tone of the movie remains misogynist as I see it! (and many other too) And that just takes the edge of a movie, that is supposed to be a romantic musical, in my book at least ...",My Fair Lady
9,classicsoncall,"""I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch""!",8,26 June 2011,"I've read the pros and cons of this film, and as an outsider looking in, my advantage perhaps is that I don't know a whole lot about George Bernard Shaw, Pygmalion, Broadway musicals and Audrey Hepburn's dubbed voice as a singing Eliza Doolittle. So coming in cold, and not particularly a fan of movie musicals, I'd have to say this was watchable enough, though at almost three hours, I WAS getting antsy after the two hour mark. I realize that fans and critics will bring their own prejudices to bear in regard to the casting and staging of the story, but that aside, and with no particular horse in the race, I'd have to say that this was entertaining enough for the kind of picture I generally don't go out of the way for. My mission is to watch and review each of the movies that appeared on the American Film Institute's original 1997 list of Best One Hundred Movies of All Time. So with a clinical approach and an open mind, I'm not predisposed one way or the other to like or dislike a picture I would have passed on otherwise. So now I've seen it, it passes muster as an entertaining film, and my movie viewing experience is that much more well rounded. With a little bit of luck, you might enjoy it too.",My Fair Lady
10,gavin6942,Not Sure I Appreciated It,6,27 March 2010,"Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) is taken in by Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), who proceeds to teach her to speak decently. After this, she becomes a lady and Higgins falls for her. But can she love a man who saw her as a project and not a lady? I didn't care for this film so much. It was goo, but not great. I found it to be one of Hepburn's lesser roles. She doesn't do her own singing, and she doesn't exude the glamor she normally does. I understand she is intentionally annoying in the first half, and does good at that, but overall it just doesn't make up for the lackluster film.I really enjoyed Rex Harrison, and thought he played an interesting character. But beyond that... the songs weren't all that memorable. Sure, there's that ""Church on Time"" song, but that's about it. And there's a nice moral about treating women like ladies regardless of their standing in society, but that's pretty lame... I think that's a common sense understanding.",My Fair Lady
11,lee_eisenberg,"Jest yew wait, 'Enry 'Iggins, an' yell see that this mewvie's akshly wuth seein', it is.",6,18 October 2005,"(Say the following with a Cockney accent.) Hello. I want to tell you about ""My Fair Lady"", a classic musical starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison. Harrison plays Dr. Henry Higgins, who bets that he can turn Cockney flower lady Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a real lady. Along the way, there's lots of songs, and Audrey Hepburn sings beautifully (well, of course; she was a beautiful woman (although I know that she was dubbed)). If you ask me, the songs didn't really add much, but either way, the movie's worth seeing.An important point here is that Audrey Hepburn does a better job faking a Cockney accent than Dick Van Dyke did in ""Mary Poppins"" (well duh, anyone could do a better job than he did, no offense to him). Still, I don't think that this movie deserved Best Picture for 1964 when ""Dr. Strangelove"" was nominated. Maybe this movie's got no cinematic value overall, but it's okay to watch.",My Fair Lady
12,jboothmillard,My Fair Lady,8,6 September 2006,"For a great musical, it seemed a pretty long film, but it is certainly worth it, from Oscar and Golden Globe winning director George Cukor. Basically ""commoner"" cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Golden Globe nominated Audrey Hepburn) dreams of having a new life as a duchess, and Professor Henry Higgins (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Sir Rex Harrison) may be the man to help her with that. Him and Colonel Hugh Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) have a bet concerning whether Henry can turn Eliza into a proper talking lady. After a long time she gets it eventually, and goes to a horse race and become part of the new trend. She later continues the process by going to the royal ball, and causing quite a (good) stir. It is only after Henry and Hugh discussing the success of the language class (and bet) that she thinks she is not important. But obviously now she is a real woman, and become good friends with them (even though they argue for a little while) she can't see going back to the old life. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Stanley Holloway as Alfred P. Doolittle, Oscar nominated Gladys Cooper as Mrs. Higgins, Jeremy Brett as Freddy Eynsford-Hill, Theodore Bikel as Zoltan Karpathy and Mona Washbourne as Mrs. Pearce. At the time there was controversy when Julie Andrews, who played Eliza Doolittle on Broadway, was not chosen for the part (and not just because of Mary Poppins), and Hepburn's singing is dubbed, but this is still essential viewing. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for André Previn, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Audrey Hepburn was number 13 on The Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Rex Harrison was number 46 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 8 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", it was number 79 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 91 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",My Fair Lady
13,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'My Fair Lady',7,2 November 2006,"THE GOOD - The visuals, for one. The sets in this movie are magnificent, some of the best I've ever seen. From the streets to the inside of the houses, they look tremendous especially on widescreen DVD. The lighting also makes them look even better. The costumes also are excellent in this three-hour classic. Rex Harrison's character, ""Professor Henry Higgins,"" is very entertaining and refreshingly politically-incorrect. Even the lyrics in his songs are so ""sexist"" they are a breath of fresh air in these days of the man-bashing NOW fanatics. Feminists must hate this movie!This is a musical/romance story. The latter is unusual in that there is no kissing, not even any holding of hands. Musically, there are many famous songs in here and I enjoyed most of them. Finally, I also enjoyed Wilfrid Hyde-White as Higgins' good friend, ""Colonel Hugh Pickering.""Note: Jeremy Brett, who went on to make a career of playing Sherlock Holmes on British TV, plays ""Freddy Eynsford-Hill.""THE BAD - Audrey Hepburn does a fine job as Eliza Dootlittle but is abrasive in the beginning and tough to understand in parts that it ruined some of the movie for me. .....at least until she ""transformed."" Then again, I never found Hepburn that appealing anyway with her voice, affected accent and bony body. Also, just a pet peeve but for a 1964 film, the exclamation ""For God's Sakes"" certainly was used a lot of times. However, in a handful of years that would be nothing compared to how God's name would be used as all restrictions were let go. OVERALL - One of those mid '60s three-hour films Hollywood loved to make that should be seen. Many of those ""epics"" were excellent and offered a ton of entertainment. This was one of them. I am not a big fan of musicals, but here is one I enjoyed.",My Fair Lady
14,rmax304823,"""Lavish, Lavisher, Lavishest.""",8,1 June 2008,"You have to keep your eyes open when a monster musical rumbles in your direction. You're liable to be demolished by a ""Dr. Doolittle"" or smothered in sugar by a ""Sound of Music"" with its ""lark that is learning to pray."" ""My Fair Lady"" is as big and expensive as any of them, but it deserves nothing but applause. The plot is taken directly from George Bernard Shaw's most entertaining play, ""Pygmalion,"" which was in turn ripped off from the Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea.The late 30s version with Wendy Hiller was fine in its own right. The latest version adds tunes by Loewe and screenplay by Lerner and it's their most memorable work. Lerner and Loewe were a famous team but wrote some clunkers -- ""If I were a bell I'd go DING DONG DING DONG DING."" Not here. The tunes aren't only not sappy but are both functional in advancing the plot and sometimes keenly witty. In ""Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?"", Rex Harrison as Professor Higgins, annoyed by Eliza Doolittle's emotionalism, queries Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White). ""If I forgot your silly birthday would you fuss?"" Pickering's offhand reply: ""Nonsense!"" Higgins: ""Then why can't a woman be more like -- US?"" See the feminist linguist Deborah Tannen for a further discussion of such gender-related issues.Rex Harrison is at his best as the down-to-earth, irascible phoneticist who is able to trace an Englishman's personal history through his speech, sometimes pinning his place of origin down to a few blocks. Probably in England at the time it could be done. Now it would be much more difficult in England or anywhere else, with what's been called ""broadcast English"" becoming the norm and with families moving around too often to acquire a regional dialect. It can still be done, though, with sensitive enough ears and a knowledge of the English class system, which is more marked than the American.Harrison does his own singing -- of a sort called ""Sprechtgesang"" I think -- which involves speaking or shouting the words while only hinting at the melody behind them. So does Hyde-White. The others are dubbed effectively. Audrey Hepburn was a dancer, not a singer.The set design by Cecil Beaton is outlandish and peculiarly apt. The sets are highly stylized, mostly black and white except for Higgins' earth tones. Fashion mavens will gush themselves to death over the women's wardrobe. What colossal hats! Not just huge in and of themselves but adorned with long feathers, pom poms, imposing flowers, and cuckoo clocks for all I know. Just note the lid on Hepburn at the races when she reverts to type and shouts out that taboo word in her gutter dialect.That's probably the funniest scene in the film, by the way, and much of it depends on Hepburn. She delivers the goods until that catastrophic imprecation. She is required to do less, but does it with equal success, at the ambassador's ball, where she is done up in a coif that resembles a crest on the helmet of a Greek warrior. Ugly as hell, if you ask me.I prefer musicals with a lot of dancing. I find the motion exhilarating. Makes my hair stand on end if it's done well. Most people can carry a tune, but how many can do Donald O'Connor's off-the-wall number in ""Singin' in the Rain""? ""My Fair Lady"" has no dance solos at all, but that doesn't detract from its appeal. It's a nice job by everyone concerned. Not a single dud among the elements.",My Fair Lady
15,moonspinner55,"Polished, but a bit inert and aloof",7,4 September 2005,"Heavy-hearted film-adaptation of the Broadway success, based on Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", weighs like a pound cake. It's too long and encumbered, with director George Cukor holding the reins too tightly on just about everyone. Lowly flower-seller Audrey Hepburn is turned from a guttersnipe into an elegant lady by smug professor Rex Harrison. The movie is posh, well-heeled, yet embalmed. Audrey usually sparkles without effort--here she's somewhat grim, with her tight little mouth held in check (her singing voice was later dubbed over, but that's done quite well); Rex Harrison is blithe and condescending, just what the professor needs to be, and he gives the carpeted proceedings a little kick. The script as such doesn't build any momentum, instead it veers off course into side-plots, which diffuses the final act. The movie is a musical but it doesn't sing, and it never really takes off into the skies the way an exuberant musical should. **1/2 from ****",My Fair Lady
16,blanche-2,One of the most beautiful musicals of all time,10,21 October 2007,"The brilliance that is ""My Fair Lady"" is caught magnificently on the screen in this 1964 film starring Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harrison, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Stanley Holloway, Gladys Cooper and Jeremy Brett. Directed by George Cukor with costumes by Cecil Beaton, it's a delicious extravaganza of beauty, elegance, comedy and glorious music.The film was made with a good deal of controversy when Julie Andrews, who had performed Eliza on Broadway, was not chosen to play the lead. Today it's hard to discern what the fuss was about. Actresses' singing voices had been dubbed for decades - suddenly there was this great uproar because Hepburn would have to be dubbed. Since Andrews was due to make her star film debut that same year in ""Mary Poppins,"" one suspects the hand of a publicist behind all the fury. Why hadn't anyone made a fuss when the pretty, highly-acclaimed Barbara Cook or other Broadway stars weren't allowed to recreate any of their Broadway roles? First of all, while Andrews was a brilliant Eliza on Broadway, she would have been much less successful on film, where the guttersnipe to princess transition would not have been anywhere near as dazzling. Who can forget Hepburn's entrance into Ascot or in her dress for the ball - she is breathtaking. Jack Warner's assertion that he needed a big female star for box office because Harrison wasn't big enough was always baloney. People would have flocked to see ""My Fair Lady"" for itself; it's one of the most famous musicals of all time, and back then, probably the most famous. The controversy was so intimidating that Hepburn didn't accept the role until she heard that Elizabeth Taylor was going to be offered the part. She then figured if there was no way Warner was hiring Andrews, she may as well do it. She was dubbed by Marni Nixon, who had dubbed singing for Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, and Deborah Kerr - and no one had blinked.The film is an orgy of color in Beaton's gorgeous costumes and in his production design. Cukor's direction is assured and keeps the film moving at a good pace. Seeing it today, perhaps the biggest surprise is Jeremy Brett as Freddy. It's very hard to realize that this was Public Television's Sherlock Holmes as we look at his unlined face and watch his juvenile manner. He's wonderful, if wasted. When researching the Audrey Hepburn book by Barry Paris, I had the great pleasure of interviewing Brett shortly before his death. A gracious, friendly man. Every actor is perfectly cast, Holloway repeating his Broadway success as Eliza's father, Gladys Cooper the ideal dowager mother, Wilfred Hyde-White the dry-humored, straightforward Pickering. Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins stands as one of the best performances ever done on Broadway, and one that made the sing-speak type of singing legitimate. After seeing countless, excellent performers do Higgins, no one has ever come up to Harrison's. He makes the misogynistic, snobbish, cold, sarcastic, irascible character so believable that it's a shock when he comes down from his pedestal near the end of the film -- and somehow is equally believable.Audrey Hepburn gives Eliza great warmth and vulnerability, making her very appealing and sympathetic to the audience. As mentioned before, her transformation is stunning, and as both a guttersnipe and a lady, she is very strong. Hepburn believed she was going to be given a chance to sing Eliza, and there are tapes of her rehearsing with the orchestra. This was often done in Hollywood to jolly along the performer - of course, no one ever had any intention of letting her sing. Perhaps, in retrospect, the powers that be should have used her voice through Eliza's guttersnipe period, where it would have been appropriate. With some mixing in the recording studio, she would have been fine. Later, when the role becomes that of a true soprano, there was really no choice - but even there, there were opportunities to use Hepburn's voice - in more of ""Just You Wait, Henry Higgins"" and ""Show Me."" Nixon, however, does a beautiful job and sings the songs as Lerner and Loew meant them to be sung. Andre Previn conducts the orchestra with great verve.Today ""My Fair Lady"" still stands as a fabulous film and a brilliant musical achievement. As far as casting, everything turned out all right - we had Audrey as Eliza and Julie as Mary Poppins - certainly the best of both worlds.",My Fair Lady
17,Quinoa1984,"""Why can't a woman be more like a man?""",5,19 February 2017,"Maybe it wasn't the right mood I was in, or maybe not seeing it in its intended MASSIVE theatrical presentation on 70mm *Super* Panavision (the kind that The Hateful Eight was shot in, to give an idea of the rarity of its stock), or maybe I wasn't in the mood for a shrill musical where the songs weren't to my liking, but this is one of those classics I just didn't get. I don't want to take this away from you if you love it or think you'd be in for this experience that is Alan Jay Lerner adapting George Bernard Shaw with Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison in two of their most identified roles (this isn't to say best or not best, just that when you think of them this has to pop up). And there are a couple of good things I can say about it, which I'll get to later on here.But I wasn't having the first hour of this at the least, where Hepburn is Eliza Doolittle (no relation to the doctor later played by Harrison, unless that was some intentional coincidence I didn't get), and she is a flower girl (basically a girl of the street, except not a prostitute), and Hepburn plays it with an obnoxious accent. It could all be in the writing from Lerner and the collaborators, but I think Hepburn can be taken to task too. I think I read she thought she was miscast, and she was probably correct - this needed a stronger, younger woman in the role who could play younger AND older with conviction, and Hepburn can do the latter but not the former so much. When she sings she's fine, but with the exception of the flagship song, ""I Could've Danced All Night,"" the songs are prattling, talking too much in song, just... ugh.Rex Harrison is fun as Higgins - maybe he could've played this in his sleep, but he still is trying, and that's appreciated - but Higgins is also a character who is a fairly outspoken misogynist, and this dates the movie. I get how it seemed probably at the time, and I had a couple of chuckles at his blustering, but by near the end of the story he hasn't really changed that much as a character. Even if he sees Eliza differently, as not the flower girl but as a real ""woman"" who's main attribute is fighting back and standing her ground, will he see other women the same now? Is this change only about his attraction and desire for her (whether it's chaste or not), or is it all shallow, like a lot of this movie may seem to be? I know the song about 'Why can't a woman be more like a man"" is meant to show how out of it he is, but it's not enough, at least for me (even if, again, Harrison tries to sell it his 'upper-crust' British best, seriously, he's the best thing about the movie).Sure, the movie is pretty - Cukor and Warner didn't spare much expense with this (okay, maybe a little, but it's not a story that requires the fx of Mary Poppins or Sound of Music's epic scope - and that is something else I can give it, up to a point. But I think that concretely I just couldn't get into it as a musical. I didn't enjoy the song as much as I should've or thought I would, and while a couple are fairly catchy (the song the men sing in the street, ""With a Bit of Luck"", is tolerable), for many of the songs I felt myself biding my time until they were over. Comparatively to Poppins again, as both were from 1964, this doesn't fare or age as well as a musical either.Again, if you like the songs then more than likely you'll dig the movie. If this review is for anyone it's people on the fence unsure whether a movie musical that was based on an earlier play (which I remember reading in school but vaguely and then got remade as She's All That, which... okay, My Fair Lady at least makes more *sense* than that does when it comes to transforming its female creature for a bet). Despite how a few scenes do have their moments - when Eliza does sort of 'break' from character that she's just cracked with some elite people at a horse race, that's amusing - it's bloated at 3 hours, and in its way kind of portends the more rancid musicals to come in the late 60's.And, lastly, as a story of class distinctions, it's... okay. You know how it's going to end up, mostly, especially as this is deeper down a romantic comedy as much as a musical. But, except for one emotional scene between Eliza and Higgings after that big regal reception (and after a musical number where, wisely cinematography-wise, she's in the background of the room) that does hit its mark well as far as how far apart these people are, I just... well, I just didn't care so much. If it does, then fine! If not, I feel for you!",My Fair Lady
18,edwagreen,Mobility with Music ***1/2,9,28 December 2011,"The Oscar for best picture of 1964 went to this musical.It was very hard to understand Audrey Hepburn at the beginning of the film with that cockneyed accent. She came into the role as the picture progressed and she became a lady.This is basically a story of class warfare set to music without the violence of Oscar winner ""West Side Story.""Rex Harrison won the best actor here and although he gave a good performance as speech professor Henry Higgins, am sure the other nominees were better. He certainly looked down on the gutter snipe Hepburn, but as the picture went by he certainly grew accustomed to her face. After he makes her a lady and she is a success at the ball, Hepburn, as Eliza, is at the crossroad of her life. What shall become of her?Will someone please explain to me why Gladys Cooper was nominated for best supporting actress here? Her part was next to nothing and she added zilch to the picture. Cooper was far more magnificent in her other nominations some 20 years before- ""The Song of Bernadette,"" and ""Now, Voyager."" She missed a 1958 supporting bid for ""Separate Tables.""Harrison mouthed the words beautifully to the music of the songs given to him. That was an achievement in itself.The picture proved without doubt that upward social mobility is possible. The film may also be described as a Cinderella like-tale.

19,wes-connors,Audrey Hepburn Walks on the street Julie Andrews where Lived,6,25 February 2011,"In this musical version of George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion"" (1912), middle-aged bachelor Rex Harrison (as Henry Higgins) thinks he can turn ""guttersnipe"" teenager Audrey Hepburn (as Eliza Doolittle) into an elegant lady. The professor works on the cockney girl's poise and linguistics. Displaying his protégée at a grand ball, Mr. Harrison fools everyone into thinking ""Eliza"" must be royalty. Harrison congratulates himself. Feeling used, Ms. Hepburn throws a tantrum. Drifting from the original characters, she and Harrison have fallen in love... This is an immaculately produced version of the stage hit, but the magnificent collection of songs contributed by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe remain what make ""My Fair Lady"" good. Note how young versus mature love is expressed in progression from ""On the Street Where You Live"" to (celebrating Harrison's love for a girl) ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"". Other song highlights include ""Wouldn't it Be Loverly?"" and ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", both of which you will likely recall as being performed by Julie Andrews... This is because Ms. Andrews' versions remain the standards. The ""Original Cast"" LP album featuring Andrews and Harrison (they originally co-starred in the stage hit) was a #1 multi-platinum hit, with Andrews' vocals receiving most of the radio airplay. A decade later, the Andrews LP still easily outsold the ""Original Soundtrack"" LP accompanying this film. This only serves to illustrate the fact that Hepburn was painfully miscast in the Andrews role. And, it wasn't only the dubbing; Hepburn was always a lady, from the opening scenes.****** My Fair Lady (10/21/64) George Cukor ~ Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harrison, Stanley Holloway, Wilfrid Hyde-White",My Fair Lady

A winner of 8 well deserved Oscars, pic boasts top line performances, songs that either gladden or melt the heart, gorgeous costumes (Cecil Beaton) and in director George Cukor the venture had a man who knew how to blend together the theatrical with the core basics of human interactions.Julie Andrews had played Eliza Doolittle on the stage and it was something of a sore point to many that Hepburn got the gig for this filmic version. It really doesn't matter, Andrews went off and made another ode to joy in ""Mary Poppins"", while here Hepburn (dubbed by the wonderful Marni Nixon for the musical numbers) absolutely lights up the screen by being funny, heart warming and simply gorgeous in equal measures.Not for everyone of course, it asks for a lot of patience since it runs at 170 minutes, while some back story issues (which I care not a jot to write about) irk others. Yet to me this is never one where I find myself looking at the clock, I'm too busy tapping my feet and being beguiled by it all.

21,jotix100,I could have danced all night!,10,16 May 2005,"""My Fair Lady"" made theater history when it opened on Broadway. The waiting for tickets to see the show was something unheard of for a sellout musical. Lerner and Loewe, its creators, probably never thought they had the tremendous hit it became, at all. The film version of ""My Fair Lady"" came to the screen via George Cukor, a man who knew about the movie business well.The film resonated with audiences because of the immensely elegant finished product Mr. Cukor offered the world. Of course, the film is helped by the genius of Cecil Beaton, who had the eye for the right style. Mr. Beaton served as art director and had a thing to say about the fabulous costumes assembled for the movie. The Ascot race sequence is a tribute to his sense of elegance.Rex Harrison, repeating the role of Professor Higgins that he originated on Broadway, gives a stellar performance. Not having seen him on stage, at least one can imagine how he amazed audiences that flocked to see the show. In the film he makes an absolutely delightful Higgins, a man of science who can't see what's in front of him. The transformation he achieves in turning the Cockney flower girl into a lady of elegance, is perhaps, something he didn't even think he would be able to pull. In Mr. Harrison's performance one can see how Eliza warms this confirmed bachelor into accepting her in a romantic way.Audrey Hepburn was chosen over Julie Andrews, the original Eliza on Broadway, in a move that puzzled everyone in the theatrical world. How could Eliza be played by anyone else, let alone that someone else would be that charming actress Audrey Hepburn? Ms. Hepburn's Eliza is a delicious characterization; her take on the poor flower girl starts slowly, taking us with her all the way. We fall in love with Eliza, the character, as played brilliantly by Ms. Hepburn, who knew how to charm us with her beauty and easy elegance in everything she did.The English cast was wonderful. Stanley Holloway, a veteran of the English cinema played Alfred P. Doolitlle, Eliza's father. Mr. Holloway is charming every time one sees him. Gladys Cooper, one of the first ladies of the English stage, is seen as Mrs. Higgins, a grande dame of society, who is charmed by Eliza and knows her son will end up loving the girl of his experiment. Wilfred Hyde-White, another distinguished actor plays Col. Pickering, Higgins' ally and friend. Jeremy Brett plays the playboy Freddy, the man that loves the street where Eliza lives!Of course, what makes ""My Fair Lady"" special is the great musical score by Mr. Loewe with lyrics by Mr. Lerner. Most of the songs are by now, standards that have delighted us since they were written and have been sung by practically all the best singers of the world.Mr. Cukor deserves credit for directing this film with his usual flair as he feasts our eyes with a stunning film that will always be loved by whoever watches it.",My Fair Lady
22,preppy-3,Terrible musical,1,19 August 2006,"Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) attempts to turn ignorant, lower-class flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady. He does but she falls in love with him while he just sees her as an experiment.THIS won the Best Picture Academy Award? The picking must have been slim that year. I'm a great lover of Hollywood musicals like ""Sound of Music"", ""Singin' in the Rain"" etc etc but this one has always left me cold. The main problem is how it's directed. George Cukor was a great director but he (unwisely) didn't ""open"" this up cinematically--it looks just like a staged play. You're always aware of that and it's a distraction. The sequence at the race horse track especially was bad--it was SO obviously a set! It makes the movie seem slow and dull.The songs vary. There are some classics (""I Could Have Danced All Night"") but to every one classic there are at least two bad ones--VERY bad ones. Also it seems strange to have a musical with next to no big production numbers (unless you count the ball). Rex Harrison also doesn't sing--he talks his numbers through and it doesn't work. He's also far too old for the role. As for Audrey Hepburn--her singing is dubbed and VERY badly. She never convinces as a flower girl either. The only actor that comes through is Jeremy Brett playing Freddy Evansford-Hull. He wisely doesn't take the film seriously.Worst of all is the truly disgusting misogyny in the film. Higgins thinks of women as slaves and ""baggage"" and, at the end, Eliza happily agrees to be that for him! THAT'S a happy ending??? I found it disturbing.Also the subplots with Eliza's father and Freddy lead to nothing and just succeed to slowing the film down even more. A long, boring musical with a very questionable ""happy"" ending. I give this a 1.",My Fair Lady
23,CinemaSerf,"Great story, great cast, great music - great entertainment!",7,17 January 2021,"A recent survey asserted that the English had the sexiest accents in the world. Perhaps not exactly the sort of recognition ""Prof. Henry Higgins"" (Rex Harrison) was seeking when, exasperated by the standards of his native language being spoken around London, he plucks poor ""Eliza"" (Audrey Hepburn"") from her flower-selling and promises his equally plummy friend ""Col. Pickering"" (Wilfred Hyde-White) that he can train her to pass in more refined society as a Duchess. Despite her initially raucous protestations - exemplifying his very point, the two lock in a battle of wills that ultimately challenges both of their opinions of each other, and dare we even suspect - engenders perhaps some respect... or more...? Oscar, BAFTA & Golden Globe winning Harrison is superb as the jovially pompous professor whose disdain for just about everything and everyone is writ large, Hepburn (with a lot of musical assistance from Marni Nixon) manages the transformation from ""gutter snipe"" to ""toff"" magnificently and there are some wonderfully characterful contributions from Stanley Holloway as her (rather venal) father; from Gladys Cooper as his rather astute mother and of course the arbiter of all things elocutionary - ""Prof. Karpathy"" (Theodore Bikel) who famously concludes that our poor ""Eliza"" is Hungarian! George Cukor has worked his magic well here with a superbly colourful, pithy and engaging adaptation of the original Shaw story and the score from Lerner and Loewe offers us some of the best rhyming lyrics ever put on paper: ""Why Can't The English"" and ""I could have Danced All Night"" being two particular favourites as well as Holloway's cracking ""I'm Getting Married in the Morning"". In a time of much more in-your-face politically correct dramatisations, I think folks could take a look at this cleverly constructed swipe at intellectual and sexual ""superiority"" and see the best man win - even if she isn't a man...",My Fair Lady
24,writers_reign,Gateau For Galatea,10,19 May 2005,"There are 142 comments for this movie and the handful I've read all address divers points. This seems to make a strong case for Musicals with strong 'Books' and songs written specifically to further the action as opposed to the Amateur fumblings of the Baz Luhrmans of this world and their inept attempts to quart of one era into the pint pot of another. MFL scores highly in all departments; strong book, strong score, strong acting, strong sense of period/costume etc. On the other hand it's arguably the Only and certainly one of a very few - in fact I can't think of another offhand - to throw its two Love songs away. The second one WAS intentional because it was written for the leading man, the non-singing Rex Harrison but the earlier example is mystifying. 'On The Street Where You Live' is a PASSIONATE love song in the best Cole Porter tradition, with a soaring melody by Fritz Loewe and though far from his best certainly adequate lyrics by Alan Lerner. This song is the musical equivalent of the person in the first flush of love who can't Contain his desire to tell the world about it and usually bores his/her friends to death. As performed by Jeremy Brett (dubbed by Bill Shirley) it is stripped of all passion and is rather insipid, THIS is someone saying 'Well, I've met this girl and she's ... all right, I suppose. Not bad, certainly ... interesting, I suppose you'd say. Not bad looking really, in fact I quite like her'. Several mainstream singers recorded the song, not least Vic Damone, with whom it has become closely associated so WHY couldn't Warners stretch to a singer who could do it justice. As it stands Jeremy Brett/Bill Shirley between them have managed to snatch a suet pudding from the jaws of a soufflé. The second love song, 'I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face' is, in many ways the PERFECT love song inasmuch as Lerner and Loewe were faced with writing a love song - and one which doubled as an 'eleven o'clock' number for a non-singing misanthrope. This is the 'self-discovery' type of love song and perhaps it needs an Actor as much as if not more than a Singer. Essentially it merely illustrates in words and music the well-documented phenomena of someone 'growing' on us surreptitiously. This is the perfect song with which to end our story; a simple end to a sumptuous show. This is definitely and unequivocally one of THE Best Musicals - Broadway and/or Hollywood - of all time.",My Fair Lady
25,zardoz-13,"This ""Lady"" Had More Than A Bit of Luck!",10,10 September 2009,"Warner Brothers film studios honcho Jack L. Warner paid CBS-TV mogul William S. Paley the sum of $5.5 million to acquire the movie rights to turn ""My Fair Lady"" into a movie. Moreover, Paley demanded 50 percent of the film's gross once it exceeded $20 million. Incidentally, ""My Fair Lady"" raked in $72-million during its preliminary theatrical release. Paley stipulated also that the film could not be released until ""My Fair Lady"" completed its Broadway engagement. According to Warner biographer Bob Thomas, Warner actually produced ""My Fair Lady,"" something that he had rarely done since the 1920s. Initially, Warner had sought Cary Grant for the role of Professor Henry Higgins, but Grant not only turned him down but also threatened to boycott the movie if Rex Harrison did not star in it. Warner approached Peter O'Toole, but O'Toole's price was too high. Warner hired the highly respected George Cukor, who had directed such classics as ""The Women"" and ""Adam's Rib,"" to helm this 170-minute film. At the time of its release, ""My Fair Lady"" generated some excitement because the star of the stage version, Julie Andrews, did not receive the Liza Doolittle role. Instead, Warner and the studio chose Audrey Hepburn because she was a recognized commodity that would attract audiences to the cinema. Indeed, Warner anted up one of the biggest pay checks ever for Hepburn, paying her a cool million. Interestingly, the 1964 Oscar for Best Performance by an actress went to Julie Andrews for ""Mary Poppins."" Reportedly, Andrews thanked Warner at the ceremonies for making her Oscar possible. According to Turner Classic Films historian Frank Miller, Rex Harrison wound up reprising his stage role as Professor Henry Higgins for $200-thousand. Harrison didn't sing a line but rather spoke his lyrics as he had done on stage. Harrison also lobbied on behalf of Andrews to get the Liza role. Veteran British character actor Stanley Holloway is a hoot as Liza's father, but Warner had originally sought James Cagney to play the role. Cagney had retired by then and could not be induced. ""My Fair Lady"" wound up costing Warner a whopping $17-million to produce, one of the most expensive movies in Hollywood at the time. 'My Fair Lady"" received the 1964 Oscar for Best Picture. The last time that a Warner Brothers movie had been accorded this high honor was in 1943 with ""Casablanca"" with Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart won the statuette. ""My Fair Lady"" also brought home the Oscars for Best Color Cinematography, Best Color Art Direction, Best Color Costume Design, Best Adapted Musical Score, and Best Sound.Director George Cukor's ""My Fair Lady"" is essentially Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's cinematic musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play ""Pygmalion."" Shaw derived the idea for his play from Greek mythology. In one of Ovid's narratives, a Cypriot sculptor Pygmalion becomes enamored with a statue of a woman that he had carved out of ivory. Shaw adapted his play in 1938 for a British film that toplined Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller. Like ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Pygmalion"" concerned a Victorian phonetician who wagers that he can teach a Cockney flower girl to speak correct English so that he can have her masquerade in high society as a lady. Wendy Hiller played Eliza Doolittle and Howard—best known for ""Gone with the Wind""—was cast as Professor Higgins. Hiller and Howard both received Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress while Shaw actually won an Oscar for his screenplay that he wrote with W.P. Lipscomb and Cecil Lewis. Ian Dalrymple and Anatole de Grunwald also contributed to the screenplay but they never received credit, while Kay Walsh provided some additional dialogue. In 1956, Lerner and Loewe rewrote the play because Shaw's work broke two important musical conventions: the main story lacked a romance and allowed no place for an ensemble. As in ""Pygmalion,"" ""My Fair Lady"" has voice coach Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) challenges his incredulous colleague, Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), that he can train boisterous Cockney street vendor Eliza Doolittle so she can talk in proper English and fool the lords and ladies at Buckingham Palace into believing that she is a duchess. Pickering not only takes the bet but also provides the funds to dress Eliza to fit the role. For six months Higgins toils day and night working on refining Eliza so that the aristocrats at the biggest social event of the season will believe that she is royalty. Of course, before it is over, both Higgins and Doolittle grow to hate each other but inevitably the hate sweetens into love at fade out. The early scenes between Harrison and Hepburn as they argue with each other at the station are hilarious. There isn't a bad song in the lot. According to Frank Miller, virtually every cent of the massive production budget of ""My Fair Lady"" appears on screen. Lerner and Loewe complained when Warner decided to lens the film on the Warner Brothers backlot. Nevertheless, Warner Brothers went to extreme lengths to recreate the actual British setting. For example, the stones for the cobblestone Covent Garden streets were manufactured one at a time, rather than following the usual practice of making them all for one mold. The sets were painted and retouched by Art director Gene Allen to give some of the edifices the illusion that they had been standing for hundreds of years. He also aged Hepburn's flower-vendor costumes so she wouldn't look too prosperous. One thing that couldn't be fixed about Hepburn was her voice. Ultimately, Warner hired Marni Nixon to dub Audrey Hepburn in spite of the actress's extensive preparation for the part. Future Sherlock Holmes actor Jeremy Brett was cast as Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Although Brett had a fine voice, Bill Shirley ended up dubbing him.",My Fair Lady

28,Boba_Fett1138,Simply delightful.,9,11 June 2011,"You don't necessarily have to be into musical to be taken in by this charming film. All I can say is that I wish there would be more musical movies like this.It's a movie with such a pleasant and joyful atmosphere to it, even though the story of course also takes some dramatic turns. But this is what musicals should all be about; simply have a good time watching it and let it be a feast for your eyes and ears.The entire movie does feel and look very stagy but in this case that really isn't a complaint. It simply suits the movie well and makes it part of the reason why this is such perfect light entertainment to watch. Besides, it is a good looking movie as well, with all of its grand sets and nice costume design.But what is a musical without any good music. And luckily this movie does really has some good and pleasant songs in it, performed nicely by its cast, though not always its original cast. Audrey Hepburn still got dubbed for instance, which was also really apparent in some of the songs. Rex Harrison on the other hand does all of the singing himself and his style of singing and acting fits the character and songs very well.Yes, all of the acting in general is very impressive in this movie as well. I had seen Rex Harrison in a couple of movies before but he never impressed me as much as he did with his role in this movie. Also Audrey Hepburn surprised me. I have always loved her but I never realized how incredible versatile as an actress she actually was until I saw her in this movie. She basically plays two different characters in this. She is both very convincing as the foul mounted girl from the streets and as the sophisticated, uppercases lady. You probably won't even recognize her at first, until she slowly starts to transform into the lovely beautiful young woman, we also all remember Audrey Hepburn as.The story and characters within this movie are definitely not all without its flaws but in this case all the story wanted was to deliver a simple, light and enjoyable movie for everybody of all ages, sexes and ethnicities to enjoy. And I think they most definitely did not fail with this.At least the Academy Awards also agree with me, since the movie received 8 Oscar's, including the most important ones for best director and best picture of the year. It also eventually would turn out to be the only Oscar legendary director George Cukor received. Simply a movie to enjoy.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",My Fair Lady
29,evanston_dad,"Many Flaws, But Enjoyable Anyway",7,13 March 2006,"Not so much a film as a taped version of the stage play, ""My Fair Lady"" is about as cinematic as a community theatre production, yet it has much to recommend it anyway.For one, the Lerner and Loewe score is timeless, and it sounds great in the film. It's also nice that it's captured in its entirety---no songs from the stage version were dropped, not even superfluous numbers like Freddie's reprise of ""On the Street Where You Live."" The film also captures the performance of Rex Harrison in the role of Henry Higgins, a role he created on stage. Like Yul Brynner in ""The King and I,"" Rex Harrison so perfectly embodied Higgins that any actor who's ever attempted to play him since has to pretty much impersonate Harrison or risk the disappointed wrath of audiences. And there are also some colorful character actors who do much with smaller roles, notably Wilfred Hyde-White as Col. Pickering, Stanley Holloway, who gets a couple of showstoppers as Alfred Dolittle, and Gladys Cooper, with maybe five minutes of screen time and no songs, but who nevertheless runs away with a couple of scenes of her own as Higgins' acerbic mother.The weakest link in this cast, it pains me to say, is Audrey Hepburn. As much as I've liked her in other things, she simply isn't convincing as Eliza Dolittle. And her lip synching is atrocious--I've never seen such a bad job of pretending to sing in a movie musical. But no one could show off Cecil Beaton's outrageous fashion concoctions to better effect, especially the scene-stealing dress and towering hat Hepburn wears in the Ascot sequence.There are actually many problems with the material itself. It's dramatically inert, for one. The plot is paper thin yet the movie continues on and on for three hours long past the point where the main conflict has been resolved. Everything feels padded; scenes seem longer than they need to be. The character of Eliza's father, which seems like a very important one on paper, could actually, when you think about it, be excised from the film entirely without in the least affecting the plot. And the musical numbers are lacking a certain vitality--the blocking consists of people just sort of walking around on sets singing or talking their way through songs, and one craves a rollicking production number here and there. George Cukor doesn't show much imagination in his directing; however, true to form, the Academy gave Cukor his sole Oscar for this, one of his most anonymous directorial efforts.But despite all of these faults, I still very much like this movie. It's fun, it's mindless, it puts me in mind of spring. It appeals to the Anglophile in me. It's a never less than respectable adaptation of one of the greatest stage musicals of all time.Grade: A-",My Fair Lady
30,AlsExGal,Funny thing about musicals from this era...,7,1 February 2021,"... that being the late 50s to the late 60s. They don't particularly age well .Looking back on them in the context of the 1960s they seem downright anachronistic. . At least this film is not offensive. Gigi, which won Best Picture of 1958, has a young woman's relatives trying to turn her into a prostitute, from which she wisely figures out there is no coming back, while Maurice Chevalier musically ogles little girls from the shelter of the bushes. That one didn't age well in a bunch of ways.This one has fabulous music, magnificent art design, quite a bit of great dry humor, and perfect casting - except I really wish James Cagney had taken the part of Eliza's father. It would have made a great bookend for his film career. The direction is perfectly on target for late career George Cukor. He won Best Director Oscar for this and didn't make another film for five years.Rex Harrison certainly deserved his Best Actor Oscar as misanthropic phoneticist Henry Higgins. He is both stern and humorous, his vocals in both song and word are alive and nothing less than perfect. Also, Wilfrid Hyde-White as Pickering adds a great deal to the film, and I appreciate him more on successive viewings.Thus it is hard to give a film with such great production values less than a 7/10. I have a couple of problems with it. First, it is just too long. Clocking in at two hours and fifty minutes, there is just too much movie for too little story. Pygmalian, starring Leslie Howard, was perfect at ninety minutes, and I actually prefer that film to this one. Second, I don't like the resolution because there isn't one. After all of that squabbling at Higgins' mother's house, after Higgins realizing he has ""grown accustomed to her face"", the end is just a let down. Had it gone on any longer it would have become Season Four of Moonlighting.",My Fair Lady
31,SimonJack,Great musical has a long history and a little controversy,9,17 April 2016,"""My Fair Lady"" is one of the best musical films of all time. It certainly is one of the most extravagant productions ever put on film. And, it's a musical with a long history and a little controversy. More on that later.Audrey Hepburn stars as Eliza Doolittle. She is the ""guttersnipe"" flower girl from Covent Garden whom Higgins will teach to speak proper English and turn into a princess. Rex Harrison plays Henry Higgins – 'enry 'iggins, to Eliza. Both are superb in their roles. She's the poor, uneducated but brassy street girl who has a heart and who dreams. He's a highly educated, egotistical perfectionist – a dedicated bachelor who is very close to being a misogynist.Surrounding them are many gifted supporting players. Stanley Holloway reprises his stage role as Eliza's dad, Alfred P. Doolittle. He sings some wonderful, funny songs. Wilfrid Hyde-White is delightful as Col. Hugh Pickering. Gladys Cooper is Mrs. Higgins. She says she loses friends after her son's visits. Mona Washbourne is Mrs. Pearce, Henry's housekeeper. Theodore Bikel plays Zoltan Karpathy who was Higgins's first and star pupil. He knows 33 languages. And, Jeremy Brett plays Freddy Eynsford-Hill, who's smitten with Eliza.The story is an old one, updated to modern times in a play by George Bernard Shaw. Shaw actually won an Oscar (shared with three other writers) for the 1938 screenplay of his original play, ""Pygmalion."" The film by the same name received three more Oscar nominations in 1939, for best picture, best actor and best actress. Top British stars of the time, Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller, had the lead roles.In 1954, Alan Jay Lerner succeeded in writing the play as a musical, with Frederick Loewe writing and composing the music. With its new title, ""My Fair Lady"" opened on Broadway on March 15, 1956 to rave reviews. When it closed on Sept. 29, 1962, it had set a record for Broadway musicals to that time with 2,717 performances.Warner Brothers paid a record $5.5 million for the movie rights. The studio got Harrison to reprise his role from Broadway, and Stanley Holloway to repeat as Alfred Doolittle. But – so the story goes, Jack Warner wasn't willing to take a chance on an untested screen actress for the part of Eliza Doolittle. Julie Andrews had created that part on stage, and she had a few TV performances behind her, including a 1957 musical special, ""Cinderella."" But Warner passed over her and went instead with Audrey Hepburn who was at the peak of her popularity and beloved by all. She had 10 years of film experience, and a number of big hits behind her – ""Roman Holiday"" of 1953, ""Sabrina"" of 1954, ""War and Peace"" of 1956, ""Funny Face"" of 1957, ""The Nun's Story"" of 1959, and ""Charade"" of 1963. The only hitch was that Hepburn was not a singer. She said so directly in film interviews. And that's wherein lies the controversy. Hepburn's songs were dubbed by Marni Nixon.Warner Brothers apparently wanted it kept secret, so the studio and performers talked around the subject in interviews. But the people in production all knew about it – especially the musicians and sound and editing staffs. And, Time magazine, even reported the dubbing way before the film's release. In a cynical article in its February 7, 1964 issue, the magazine said that the singing voice ""on the sound track won't be Audrey's. It belongs to Marni Nixon, the ghostess with the mostest"" At the Academy Awards the next spring, Julie Andrews won the best actress Oscar for ""Mary Poppins."" In her acceptance, she thanked Jack Warner for passing over her for the part in ""My Fair Lady."" Hepburn wasn't even nominated for ""My Fair Lady,"" and some have speculated that Andrews may have won with a sentiment vote. In a 1995 documentary on the making of ""My Fair Lady,"" Julie Andrews said she will never know. While she'd like to think it was for her performance in ""Mary Poppins,"" she thought it might have been based on sentiment.Ever the lady and kind performer herself, Andrews's guess may be partly right. Composer and musician Harold Lloyd Weber in that same documentary, said that in England people were surprised that Hepburn got the role because Andrews had so nailed the role in the stage play when it played there. And, if audiences can be a sign of how the members of the Academy might vote, then the signs looked bright for Andrews and Mary Poppins.While ""Lady"" won eight Oscars with four more nominations, ""Poppins"" won five Oscars with 8 more nominations. And ""Poppins"" out-earned ""Lady"" by a huge amount. ""Lady"" grossed $72 million on a budget of $17 million. But ""Poppins"" grossed more than $102 million in the U.S. on a budget of $6 million.""My Fair Lady"" was restored in 1995 and preserved from near loss. A 1995 documentary, ""Making of My Fair Lady,"" gives much interesting background on the film. It comes with the DVD in some packages. I give some of the fascinating facts in my comments on that film.I have a CD recording of the stage performance of ""My Fair Lady."" Julie Andrews puts tremendous life into the songs. While I enjoy Audrey Hepburn in this film, I would have loved to hear Julie Andrews singing Eliza's role on film.""Controversy aside, this is a fine film that many people should enjoy for a long time to come. Audrey Hepburn and Julie Andrews are both superb performers and fine people. Future generations will be able to enjoy much of the great work they have left us.",My Fair Lady
32,JamesHitchcock,Perhaps My Favourite Musical of the Sixties,9,2 January 2005,"Shaw's Pygmalion was written in support of its author's controversial thesis that class divisions in British society could be overcome by encouraging the use of Received Pronunciation (supported by reformed spelling in a phonetic alphabet)in place of regional and class accents. (The story concerns a professor of phonology who accepts a bet that he can teach a Cockney flower-seller to speak like a duchess.) This makes it a curious basis for a Broadway musical, given that most Americans have little interest in the linguistic aspects of the British class system and little ability to distinguish British accents. It is therefore hardly surprising that Audrey Hepburn does not sound much like a native of Lisson Grove (a predominantly working-class district of North-WestLondon with an accent slightly different to the better-known East End Cockney). She was clearly under instructions to exaggerate her accent to such an extent that even an American audience could not fail to appreciate the contrast with the accents of the posh characters.Despite its unlikely subject-matter,My Fair Lady was a great success, both as a stage musical and as a film. There are a number of reasons for this. Shaw was able to create witty dialogue and interesting characters, even when he was writing a didactic piece (which most of his plays are). The songs are unfailingly tuneful. In my opinion, however, the main reason for the success of the film version is due to one factor; the casting of Audrey Hepburn. Although Hepburn held British citizenship she was, on her mother's side, a member of the Dutch aristocracy, and had spent much of her youth abroad, so she might not have seemed the most likely choice as a London flower-girl. (She was also in her mid thirties, considerably older than the character she plays). At the time, many felt that the role should have gone to Julie Andrews, who had played the part in the stage version. Hepburn was, however, the most beautiful, elegant and charismatic actress of her generation, with an uncanny ability to make a film by her presence alone. Try imagining Breakfast at Tiffany's or Roman Holiday with any other actress in the lead. Or Sabrina.(Actually, someone obviously did try imagining Sabrina with another actress,which is why we ended up with that embarrassing Julia Ormond remake).My Fair Lady is another example of Audrey's gift at work. Although to British ears she might not seem entirely convincing as a Cockney in the earlier scenes, she dominates the latter part of the film when Eliza has been transformed into a gracious society lady.I have never heard the versions of the songs that Audrey recorded herself, so I cannot say whether the decision to have her singing dubbed was the right one. Certainly, Marni Nixon does a fine job, although, on the evidence of Funny Face and Breakfast at Tiffanys, Hepburn had a better voice than popular belief has given her credit for. Of the other characters I particularly liked Stanley Holloway’s comic turn as Alfred Dolittle, Elizas old reprobate of a father. (In an inversion of the normal generation gap, the teetotal, virginal Eliza is far more puritanical than her father). Rex Harrison makes an amusing Professor Higgins, even though he was obviously no singer and was rather older than I had imagined Shaws character.When I first saw the film, I disliked the decision to change Shaw’s ending, which I saw as a surrender to Hollywood sentimentality. Having seen it again, I am inclined to change my mind. A romance, of sorts, between Eliza and Higgins is by no means inconceivable. Higgins may be a sexist and a snob, but he is certainly not gay, as some have speculated. Why Cant a Woman be More Like a Man is quite a common sentiment among male heterosexuals. Higgins reminded me of those representatives of modern British lad culture who choose potential wives and girlfriends on the basis of male rather than female attributes. A woman is valued less for her personality or sex appeal than for her interest in such matters as alcohol and sport. It is the same with Higgins, except that he will expect Eliza to be able to discuss not lager and the offside rule but labiodental fricatives and the First Great Sound Shift. Eliza might be a beauty, but far more important to Higgins is the fact that she is the first woman he has ever met who shares his interest in linguistics. If Eliza can adapt to Higgins expectations (there is no indication that he will ever adapt to hers), there is no reason why their union should not be a happy one.This is also a very attractive film visually, especially the two famous showpiece scenes at Royal Ascot and the Embassy Ball. The former is particularly striking, with the black and white costumes creating a remarkable stylised look. Cecil Beaton well deserved his Oscar; seldom can costume design have contributed so much to the success of a film. On the subject of Oscars, the great scandal, of course, is that Audrey was not even nominated; perhaps the Academy felt embarrassed by the number of leading ladies in musicals who did not do their own singing. I felt that Harrison was a rather fortunate winner against some very strong opposition, but the Best Picture award was well deserved. This is perhaps my favourite musical of the sixties. 9/10",My Fair Lady
33,lasttimeisaw,a humdinger emblazoned with sparkling gender politics and chipper euphony.,8,15 September 2017,"Fairly speaking, vintage Hollywood musicals don't age well thanks to their tie-ins with ingrown fluffy affectation and sound-stage-bound artificiality, which doesn't see eye to eye with the surge of an ever-finicky/skeptical modern audience. But mercifully, MY FAIR LADY, George Cukor's Oscar BEST PICTURE title-holder, still can hold court and rivet viewers through its lilting numbers, tableaux vivants par excellence, and a barnstorming cast headlined by Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison. Cashing in on the popularity of George Bernard Shaw's stage play PYGMALION and its subsequent musical iteration from Lerner and Loewe, this film adaptation is first and foremost, a well- intention-ed crowd-pleas-er and takes no prisoners in flagging up its swagger and grandeur, both interior and exterior, the story-line pits a cockney flower seller Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) against Prof. Henry Higgins (Harrison), a misogynistic scholar of phonetics, who boasts that under his tutelage, within a six-month stint, he can transmogrify Eliza into a bona-fide duchess, to be presented in an embassy ball. Making allowance for Henry's make-up, he is way too snobbish to rope ""that filthy, silly girl"" into the deal, so it must be Eliza, who takes up the gauntlet of her own accord, with an impetus of bettering herself which attunes with the Edwardian time, when suffragettes are spotted parading on the streets of London. Abetted by Colonel Hugh Pickering (Hyde-White), Henry's new acquaintance and a kindred spirit in phonetics (who also implausibly and conveniently, co-habits with the pair in Henry's abode, indeed, their male bonding will grow chummier as a cross-current of the central gender spar, and reach its apogee in A HYMN TO HIM, WHY CAN'T A WOMAN BE MORE LIKE A MAN), a bet is struck and this folie-à-trois segues comically and tunefully through many mishaps and frustrations until Eliza magically expunges her cockney accent in THE RAIN IN SPAIN, under the spell of a patriotic rhetoric from Henry, and then is thrown into elation through Eliza's I COULD HAVE DANCED ALL NIGHT, alas! The biggest hindrance has been officially conquered!(suspended disbelief is critical to countenance this deus ex ma-china, subtlety and logic is given a wide berth here.) A leitmotif is the paralleled contrast between the transformation of Eliza, her appearance/utterance along with her inner state elevated by it and the intransigence of Henry, who habitually treats Eliza as a guinea pig, and takes her efforts for granted, the climax comes not in the palatial ball, but after, when a simmering Eliza lets rip to a bemusing Henry, who still has no clue why she suddenly blows a fuse on their (him and Pickering's) triumphant night, what an exasperating pedantic and egoist bore! Serendipitously, what trenchantly tones down Henry's defective persona is Mr. Harrison's invigorating elocution and a left-field approach of doing his numbers by speaking his lines in a singsong tone, pertinently deadens the schmaltzy impact of the material (I'M AN ORDINARY MAN) and leavens the hoary template, in the end of the day, Henry is the one who has learned a lesson, however unmerited he is, it is a cracking exemplar of a none-too-pleasant character salvaged by a transcendent show-stopper. Needlessly to say, being dubbed in a musical by a splendid belt-er (in this case, the unsung star here is Marni Bixon) takes the shine off an otherwise wholesome and majestic performance from Ms. Hepburn (who replaced Julie Andrews from the original musical play, ironically the latter won an Oscar the same year for MARY POPPINS while the former was given a cold shoulder early in the nomination stage, albeit the movie was being doled out a magnanimous twelve nominations including that vexatious coattail one for the venerable Ms. Gladys Cooper, who is barely present and given nothing remotely concrete to act), not in her prime though (she was 35-year-young to play a 21-year-old damsel), her portrayal of a girl's metamorphosis through her manner, accent and inward orbit is magnificent and isn't being eclipsed by her gorgeous wardrobe and millinery accouterments, her Eliza is a full-bodied character rising above her rite of passage as a winner refusing to take the short end of the stick (although the ending predictably but gingerly winks at a compromised happy-ending). Stanley Holloway steals the limelight with his own voice in two merry pieces (WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK and GET ME To THE CHURCH ON TIME) as Eliza's bullheaded father Alfred, and is granted with a hard-earned Oscar nomination (au contraire of Ms. Cooper); a young, handsome and debonair Jeremy Brett (also dubbed in his singing by Bill Shirley) is a commensurate match for Ms. Hepburn, and a genteel Wilfrid Hyde-White drolly slums it in the singing-and-dancing sequences but captures an air of lassez-faire pulsating mostly on the sideline of this humdinger emblazoned with sparkling gender politics and chipper euphony.",My Fair Lady
34,llltdesq,The character of Henry Higgins is greatly misunderstood by many and so is the film.,8,28 December 2003,"I have read in a great many places (including the IMDb) that Henry Higgins is a misogynist.  It has also been said that the film is a misogynist's fairy tale.  Anyone saying this has clearly not watched this film too closely. First, Higgins is not a misogynist.  A misogynist hates women.  What Higgins is, in reality, is a misanthrope.  A misanthrope basically dislikes and distrusts everyone!  Watch the film and you'll notice that Higgins treats everyone with the same disregard-Col. Pickering, Eliza's father, his own mother-everyone receives his rather cynical disdain. Some of the minor characters come off being treated worse than the principals do.  It's simply more noticeable with Eliza because it's more frequent, it's newer with Eliza because the other principal characters have known Higgins longer and thus take it in stride.  The myth that Higgins is a misogynist is perpetuated by the song, ""Why Can't A Woman Be More Like a Man?"".Second, it can hardly be called a misogynist's fairy tale.  If that were the case, I doubt Alfred Doolittle would have cause to sing, ""Get Me To the Church On Time"", as he'd hardly be getting married.  His life is just as ""ruined"" as Eliza's by his encounters with Higgins, just as altered as her life has been.This is a great musical, a good movie and it was even better as the original play by Shaw.  Well worth seeing.  Recommended.",My Fair Lady
35,cherold,Entertaining if a bit problematic,7,28 November 2017,"One of the great struggles in theater is emotional truth versus emotional satisfaction. Witness George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, which aimed for a true ending of emancipation but which was turned by various producers and rewriters into something less uncompromising to satisfy the audience's emotional desires.The musical My Fair Lady is Pygmalion with songs. An obnoxious linguist who believes class is not fundamental but is simply a matter of virtue signaling through things like language bets he can pass a flower girl off as a high-born lady. It's a virtuous belief, but the linguist is an obnoxious jerk. But as in the old movie, that jerkiness is sanded smooth with actorly charm. Which is why the ending bugs a lot of people, some of which will advise you to simply stop watching after ""Without You,"" which would result in something close to what Shaw wanted.I don't disagree, and I think Shaw's idea that Charles Laughton would be an ideal Henry Higgins shows you how far afield Broadway and Hollywood have gone.The movie version of the musical also suffers from the casting of Audrey Hepburn. While the play is meant to show that language and a basic knowledge of social niceties is all that separates one class from another, Hepburn goes through a complete character change from feral child to conflicted and elegant lady. From clips I've seen of Broadway originator Julie Andrews singing some of the songs, I suspect she would have done better at making Eliza the same person and keeping the changes to grammatical ones while making Eliza cannier at first and flintier at last.It's also unfortunate that Hepburn's songs were dubbed. Her singing, as heard on youtube, was okay, and while Marni Nixon was the better singer, it seems unfair to insist on perfection from Hepburn while allowing Harrison to talk through his songs.Still, the songs are excellent, catchy and witty, and the production is solid. If you aren't too bothered by terrible people being portrayed as charming and quirky, or by Hepburn's overacting in the early scenes, this is still a lot of fun.Personally, were I to direct this I would have Higgins and Pickering realize they were in love with each other during the play. But that's just me.",My Fair Lady

37,ElMaruecan82,It takes forever to go nowhere special...,6,22 November 2016,"George Cukor's ""My Fair Lady"" is as close to auteur cinema as ""Baby Geniuses"" to ""The Godfather"", nothing remotely ambitious on the field of philosophy, religion or any form of abstract thinking, but I'm still using a word (one I personally hate) to describe it: it is a pretentious film. As intellectually vacuous as it is, it is pretentious in the sense that it takes a sweet, enchanting story, made of charming and engaging characters, and drag on for almost three hours for a plot requiring one hour less. This is a case where a little less would have been a lot more.""West Side Story"" was longer but its fast-paced rhythm and the catchy songs actually drove the plot instead of slowing it down, ""The Sound of Music"" felt a tad long, but it had a rather dense plot, while ""My Fair Lady""'s can be summed up into a spot-it with a marker. It is about linguist Professor Higgings meeting a vulgar flower girl named Eliza Doolitlle and after months of training, he turns her into a lady, in the process, he falls in love with her, although he refuses to admit it. But in the end, they get together, bada-beep, bada-boom. There are a few subplots but they are merely dressing, the piece of resistance is what everyone remembers.Now, I'm not criticizing the conventional fairy-tale aspect of the story, but it was two-hour material, plain and simple. No, they had to stretch it to three hours, with the obligatory intermission. Obviously, they knew they had a Best Picture contender so it had to pretend to be as epic as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""West Side Story"" or ""Tom Jones"". So it takes like half an hour for the film to take off and basically, each significant moment is interrupted by a musical interlude, I liked the ""With a Little Bit of Luck"" song but what did it have to do with the story anyway? Apparently, we were supposed to enjoy it and that was enough a reason.The film actually makes me question the appeal of musicals, why should people singing and dancing together be an entertaining sight? My guess is that it was the taste of the time, and people loved to enjoy in theaters what they could see on the stage, or maybe it was the star-system and Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison were the kind of offers one couldn't refuse. But I'd rather have that sirtaki in ""Zorbas"" or five minutes of ""Dr. Strangelove"" than any of these tiresome musical acts, at least these films had something to show, even ""Mary Poppins"" had animation, I'm afraid ""My Fair Lady"" had a rather thin plot with music used as fillers,It is a difficult-to-review film because I'm not really even interested in reviewing it, it is even based on a lie, that Audrey Hepburn could be believable as a crass girl, it's like imagining Grace Kelly playing a prostitute, there's nothing such as limited range, but we know Hepburn can only ""act"" her way through a character like Eliza Doolittle and gets easier to handle once she becomes the classy woman she's always been, that ugly duckling thing couldn't fool anyone, and if she didn't overact, she way overdid her accent. Rex Harrison, as annoying as sexist as he was, was pretty convincing as Higgins but the whole relationship rang abominably false. It is supposed to be a love story but most of the time, these two keep snarling at each other, they couldn't even exchange one lousy kiss at the end, I know it's all about subtext, but still. Still, this film worked and became one of the all-time box-office successes, an event by itself, one I would never get. And don't get me started with the Oscars. Granted the film won the Best Costume, Art Direction and all the categories you'd never remember the names, but Best Picture? Best Director? What makes Cukor's directing so exceptional? Is it more difficult to direct a film like this than ""Strangelove""? The 60's used to reward cinematic excellence but art shouldn't be made at the expense of a story, and it's only justice that ""Dr. Strangelove"" is more celebrated today than ""My Fair Lady"". And if you want an excellent romance with Audrey Hepburn, take ""Roman Holiday"" or ""Sabrina"".There's one thing I enjoyed though, it was the Bonus features and I was more interested to see Rex Harrison being natural and Audrey Hepburn as sweet as usual, I thought to myself, I don't know if younger actors would've been as good, but if the cast had played these parts as naturally, it could have been something. And then there was Jack Warner who, during a press conference, made a remarkable speech about old school Hollywood cinema and wished directors wouldn't try to copy European filmmakers, you could tell the disdain in his tone, well, he was right in foreshadowing the end of the studio system (and even in the interviews, the productions costs were a matter of discussions), these costly musicals almost bankrupted the studios, because for one ""My Fair Lady"", you had a few disasters.The film marks with ""The Sound of Music"" the swan songs of an era , the time for better movies were to come, and it's extraordinary to believe that the film was only two years before ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and three before ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Graduate"". Being a hardcore New Hollywood fan, a production like ""My Fair Lady"" could only make me feel cold, I'm not even sure this will be a review I'd love to read again once.... but I'll end with a piece of advice, you want to see it? Fine. Be sure you're doing something at the same time, otherwise, time will feel painfully long.",My Fair Lady
38,MOscarbradley,Better you see the stage show,8,8 January 2008,"A musical juggernaut that trundles on forever. Shaw's play was splendid and not because of its irksomely misogynist story-line but because Shaw created characters that were believable in themselves and not because of their situations and he gave them splendid pithy lines to say. In turning it into a musical the writer Alan Jay Lerner had the sense to retain the best of Shaw while Frederick Loewe's music was innocuous enough to prove too much of a distraction. Indeed, the songs in ""My Fair Lady"" fit the action more comfortably than is usual and the original stage show marked a departure for the stage musical by incorporating the songs seamlessly into the narrative. It has always proved an energizing evening in the theatre.George Cukor's film version works on the axiom that if it isn't broke there is no need to fix it. Cukor was never a 'filmic' director. He was fine director of actors and he loved the written word. Perhaps the most innovative thing about ""My Fair Lady"" was its refusal to be anything but filmed theatre on a very massive scale. There is no attempt to open it out from its stage-bound origins. You feel as if you are in the best seats in the stalls of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.Nor was he an innovative director of musicals. Plonking his camera in front of the performers was his idea of how to record a number but since, in this instance, the songs and the narrative were very much one and the same, this hardly mattered. And it preserves Rex Harrison's great performance as Higgins. Harrison had played the role so often on the stage like breathing out and breathing in it was second nature to him.His Eliza was more problematic. Fearing that Broadway's Julie Andrews was an unknown quantity producer Jack Warner cast, instead, Audrey Hepburn, an established star, then had her songs dubbed by Marni Nixon. Andrews' revenge was an Oscar for ""Mary Poppins"" while Hepburn failed to get a nomination. The film version also preserves Stanley Holloway's indelible Doolittle while Cecil Beaton's sets and costumes are even more stunning on the (very) big screen than they were in the theatre. So it certainly looks the part and for a great deal of the time it sounds it, too. It's 'an entertainment', overlong at three hours and not to everyone's temperament, set more in aspic than in stone. Best you see it on the stage.",My Fair Lady
39,ThomasDrufke,"""I'm a good girl, I am""",6,1 September 2014,"This film is like a mix between The King's Speech and Les Miserables. It has all the makings of a musical but it's also a great story. Eliza Doolittle is a poor woman in London who only gets by selling flowers. She comes across a phonetics professor who swears to help Eliza speak properly. Professor Henry Higgins mostly wants to transform her into a princess like woman in order to up his ego and be looked at as a hero in front of his peers. In fact, the whole thing was because of a bet he made with the captain. It has it's marvelous musical moments but at the same time I cant imagine this film winning Best Picture over Mary Poppins or even Dr. Strangelove. With it's long runtime it has plenty of room for the classic songs but fails to really capture my heart like most of Audrey Hepburn's movies have.Hepburn's portrayal of the flower picker was at first obnoxious but I learned to love it, unfortunately it ends about 45 minutes into the film. But her portrayal of the transformed Eliza was what saved the movie for me. Because she learns to become independent and discovers what she wants in life. It's great character development, but unfortunately the way the movie ends undercuts that, and takes the more typical romantic approach. It's made to make you believe that these two characters end up truly caring for each other but in reality all they have done the full 3 hours was bicker at each other. And I never once noticed Professor Higgins even acknowledge that women are not just for show or 'toys'. Even his last words are something along the lines of ""fetch me my shoes dear"".On the Brightside most of the songs are beautifully written and performed. Although I don't understand why they had to dub Hepburn's voice. Her moon river performance alone should be note that she can definitely sing. Her voice was so different from her singing voice that it nearly took me out of the film. The supporting characters also have their moments with musical notes. The Fred story was the least interesting. You don't love someone after just meeting them, and Hollywood has used that thread for too many movies.Overall I think it's movie that I would watch a few scenes on cable for but I wouldn't buy a copy myself. The score and soundtrack are classic but I think I can comfortably say the movie as a whole is a bit overrated, as much as I love Audrey Hepburn in this role.+Audrey Hepburn is flawless as usual +Score/Soundtrack is a classic+Eiza's story arc -Ending is typical and unrealistic -Voice dubbing was off-putting -Why not film in London? 6.7/10",My Fair Lady

Plus, Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins is delightfully despicable. This film runs a little long and my kids were a little bored by it, but there's still an enduring charm to this tale.

41,atlasmb,A Wonderful Musical,10,8 July 2014,"So many reviews on this site debate whether or not Julie Andrews should have been cast in the lead. Others analyze Shaw's intentions, his play, or the Broadway musical in delivering a verdict on the film. Such musings may be interesting, but they have nothing to do with the merits of this film. It is a piece of art that stands on its own.As such, I feel that ""My Fair Lady"" is one of the best film musicals ever made. Audrey Hepburn is perfectly suited to the role of Liza. Most of her singing was dubbed, so we will never know if Hepburn herself had the chops to convincingly sing the entire part. But I find her acting wonderful.Liza Doolittle is a Cockney flower girl who seems content with her dirty life in the street. It should be noted that ""the street"" in this film is on a sound stage. And it is not really dirty, though Liza's cheeks might be dirtied somewhat. This is no gritty representation of real life. As with most musicals, there is an element of cleanliness that might suggest derivation from the stage. Hepburn captures the essence of the young woman with her howling speech and her readiness to battle over any perceived slight.Henry Higgins (played by Rex Harrison) is a snooty academic who jousts with other academics over minor variations in regional speech patterns. He accepts a wager from his associate, Colonel Pickering, promising he can transform the dirty guttersnipe into a refined woman fit for high society.Over a period of time, Higgins schools and browbeats Liza until he has indeed created a reasonable representation of refinement. But underneath the façade, Liza has the same personality.The music created by Lerner and Loewe is ""loverly"", even the parts designed for Higgins, which Harrison mostly singsongs rather than sings.The film won 8 Academy Awards. The staging is excellent. The costuming is superb.The ""Ascot Gavotte"" number is sheer perfection and deserves special mention. The upper crust are assembled trackside, watching the race. Presenting a frozen tableau, they deliver an emotionless, clipped description of their own excitement and the ""frenzy"" of the race. This is understated humor at its best. The men wear gray suits and hats, while the women are bedecked in exquisite gowns and hats of black and white. At the conclusion of the race, they execute a precision promenade that is choreographed perfectly. As they pivot and prance, they narrowly avoid one collision after another--more wonderfully subtle humor. Finally, Hepburn floats onto the scene, dressed in a black and white ensemble that somehow rises above the others. Holding her head erect with that impossibly graceful neck, she is the regal Nefertiti or a personification of a beautiful swan.The story presents a clever plot device in the character of Zoltan Karpathy, a Hungarian linguist with an impeccable reputation for divining the regional roots of any speaker. Can Liza pass for English society despite Karpathy's detective work?After the experiment is over, and the wager decided, what will become of Liza? With no work skills other than selling flowers, must she go back to the streets? Having used her for his academic purposes, will Higgins abandon her? Does he even have the emotional capacity to consider her feelings?""My Fair Lady"" is a beautifully staged film filled with wonderful moments. I rate it ""10"".",My Fair Lady
42,Bored_Dragon,"""What the girl does here is our affair. Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it.""",8,19 October 2020,"In this legendary film adaptation of the famous London and Broadway musical, Rex Harrison reprises the role of pompous professor of phonetics, who, for a bet, brings home a poor street flower girl in order to re-educate her into a lady. The film was nominated for twelve Oscars, of which it won eight. Interestingly, Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated for the role of Eliza Doolittle, while her theatrical predecessor, Julie Andrews, won an Oscar the same year for the role of Mary Poppins. I do not dispute the absolutely deserved Julie's Oscar, but I think that Audrey deserved at least a nomination, for the transformation she showed in this film and the strong emotions she conveyed on the screen. And I think there is no need to spend words on her charm and charisma. I'm not a fan of musicals, let alone three-hour movies, but this three-hour musical is definitely worth paying attention to, regardless of your film taste. A simple but interesting story, intelligent and witty dialogues, unpretentious music tracks, scenography and directing that leave the impression of watching a theater play but give it epic proportions, a fairytale atmosphere, and a great cast make this musical one of the most impressive achievements of the sixties' cinema. Mandatory for every film buff, if there are any who haven't seen it yet at all.8,5/10",My Fair Lady
43,kenjha,Overblown,6,9 November 2007,"The musical version of ""Pygmalion"" is a mixed bag. Hepburn and Harrison are both good, although Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard were better attuned to the characters in the 1938 film of ""Pygmalion."" The songs sung by Eliza (Marni Nixon dubbing Hepburn) are lovely. Too bad they did not dub Harrison's talk-singing (a precursor to rap?), which is rather annoying. The numbers by Holloway are also amusing if superfluous to the rest of the film. Cukor was known more for eliciting good acting than for any cinematic genius. Here he does little more than film a theatrical production and he leaves out nothing. At nearly three hours, it is at least an hour overlong.",My Fair Lady
44,clanciai,Turning a tramp into more than a lady,10,5 February 2021,"The old Greek myth is about Pygmalion the artist who makes a statue come alive as a beautiful lady. Bernard Shaw turned the story the other way, making a fresh natural original young woman turn into a statue by brainwashing her into speaking well. The musical is not quite according to Bernard Shaw's intentions, and in the impersonation by Audrey Hepburn the statue/street girl turns into what neither Bernard Shaw nor Henry Higgins intended or expected. The difference is made by the lyrics, the music and Audrey Hepburn.
Many expected her to get an Oscar for her part, but it went instead to Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins. Julie Andrews had played Eliza Dolittle innumerable times on stage with Rex Harrison as Higgins and with tremendous success, making the musical one of the most successful of all times, and it was almost expected that she would also be given the part on film. Instead, the movie part went to Audrey Hepburn, and naturally the question rises, whether Julie Andrews with her professional musical routine would have made it better, especially in view of the Oscar she received for Mary Poppins. It's possible, that she would have made it better, but she would hardly have made it more beautiful. Audrey Hepburn as Eliza actually emerges as a lady in spite of Higgins' rude bullying, and played by Audrey Hepburn she actually becomes quite convincing as a princess if not a queen - she becomes more than a lady, more beautiful, more noble and more royal than Julie Andrews ever could have done. This was actually her last great performance and something of the crowning achievement of her stardom, before she turned to less glamorous parts, while Julie Andrews went on in her stardom as just a musical star.
Another great asset of major importance of the film is Cecil Beaton's fashionable settings, dressing everyone up to heavenly standards, already.visually stríking in the first scene and even more in the great Ascot scene. But the music is the crown jewel of this film, making it a crown jewel also of musicals, and Andre Previn's orchestration adds further lustre to Frederick Loewe's music. He would never make music like this again, both ""Gigi"" and ""Camelot"" are inferior to ""My Fair Lady"", where every melody strikes home as unforgettable. In brief, this musical reached its ultimate pinnacle of success as a perfect film.",My Fair Lady

The interpretations of both Audrey Hepburn who played as Eliza Doolittle and Rex Harrison who played as Professor Henry Higgins were simply outstanding and their differences as characters made this movie even more interesting.

48,zkonedog,Henry Higgins: Iconic Character,10,3 March 2017,"There are many reasons to watch ""My Fair Lady"": It has incredible music. It is splendidly colorful. Audrey Hepburn is at her stylish best. What always draws me to this movie, though, is the incredible performance turned in by Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins. The journey of his character is the central block among-st which everything else coalesces around.For a basic plot summary, ""My Fair Lady"" is a grand experiment proposed by uber-bachelor Higgins (Harrison) and friend Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White). He bets Pickering that he can take lowly ""gutter-snipe"" Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) and turn her into a ""lady"" by primarily changing her phonetics.Like I said, there are numerous reasons to watch the film. Immediately after viewing, I purchased the soundtrack to add to my music collection, as it is that good. Watching in HD also allows the colorful nature of the film to really ""pop"". Women will also likely be captivated by the fashions and the contrast between what Eliza starts off as and who she becomes.As a ""fellow"" watching the film, however, I became more immersed in the journey of Professor Higgins than anything else. I personally have never seen Rex Harrison in any other movie, so to me every time I watch ""My Fair Lady"" he is 100% Higgins without bias. Whereas I was sometimes a bit confused with how we were supposed to understand Eliza's character, I could completely identify with Higgins (being male probably helps in this case). Without his performance, the experience of watching the film for me would have been a long, LONG three hours. With him in it, the time seems to fly by.I would also be remiss not to mention a sparkling performance from Stanley Holloway as Mr. Doolittle (Eliza's father). Though I can't exactly put my finger on what his character brings to the overall relationship dynamic of the movie, Holloway contributes some of the catchiest musical numbers of the entire experience.Overall, ""My Fair Lady"" is my favorite ""sophisticated musical"" to watch (only behind ""Mary Poppins"" in terms of musicals overall). Even though from the box art and trailer materials it looks more like a female-oriented production, it truly is not because of Harrison. A film that the whole family can enjoy, to be sure.",My Fair Lady

51,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Pleasant musical of 2 entertaining but prejudiced characters,8,14 April 2020,"A pleasant musical of two entertaining but prejudiced charcaters. My Fair Lady has a long runtime of around three hours and that's why it looks quite ordinary but if you really pay attention to the music and the lyrics or if you're a Music Lover then i believe you can enjoy this musical again and again without complaining about the the runtime. A phonetic professor drawn with his own arrogance accepts the challenge to transform a roadside flower girl into presentable high class society girl of England, he succeeds but however both of them became habitual of each other's company. I can't say it is Love as it wasn't clearly mentioned in the film but for me this is something more interesting than Love because it isn't regular. Although both of them admit it, they don't want to change thier own Nature. That's quite relative, i feel. Because they were like this only and that's why they liked each other, now why should they change all of sudden just after knowing they are liking each other. Many people didn't understand these things while judging professor's character i guess. Rex Harrison won the deserving Best Actor Oscar and Audrey Hepburn looks elegant while portraying Elza with perfection. Thier Musicial chemistry was engaging. Despite the long runtime the film never looked boring to me, well that's a big thing if i tell you that i don't listen to or know English music much. Director George Cukor bought the conviction in his storytelling and that's all what i wanted. Also, the technical parts like Cinematography, Sound Mixing and use of all the production design properties were unexpectedly very very good. Overall, My Fair Lady has a pleasant story, great acting involved, soulful music, meaningful lyrics, eye pleasing production design and well made dramatization of an unusual bonding. 8 Oscars might looks too much now days but it surely deserved half of them in worst case as there wasn't much competition.

52,matthewssilverhammer,HOT TAKE: Hepburn is delightful,8,8 January 2020,"Famously, an unknown Julie Andrews played the Doolittle role on Broadway. Many thought she should've revived her role in the film. However, Hepburn removes every doubt. She's immediately & consistently hilarious, engaging & wonderful, playing the strong but naïve Eliza with a perfection rarely seen. If the movie had ended after the horse race, it would be perfect...not that the back half is terrible, but the romance angle & classism study just don't have half the burst of comedic life of the first half.",My Fair Lady

54,Polaris_DiB,Pretty good,5,9 December 2006,"This is a pretty good musical: the songs are snappy, the cinematography and choreography are great, and it has a pretty endearing story. The characters are what stand out most about it... Audrey Hepburn proves her worth and more alone, not to mention Rex Harrison and the support.It's sort of a loose remake of Pygmalion, which is in turn a play based off of the Greek myth... interestingly enough, having viewed this movie I now understand Pretty Woman to be a loose remake of My Fair Lady. In other words, this is a very recognizable story, though one focused a lot more on class consciousness of the Brits than most.The costuming is a little ridiculous, though from what I understand it's supposed to be--the absurd dresses the women wear are supposed to poke fun at the aristocracy. The horse race is probably one of the best parts in the movie, even if it's anything but subtle.I think really this film's strength lies almost entirely on Professor Higgins. He's such an easily detestable character, but still he's endearing and wonderful to watch. I think it's easy to disagree with him but it's wonderful to watch him as he struggles with his passions.--PolarisDiB",My Fair Lady

This movie makes a successful and effective transition from the stage to screen because it stays true to the original story and avoids adding those embellishments that usually detract from and dilute the quality of the original story and music. The movie is great for these reasons: snappy dialog, strong acting, great songs, and an engaging story that avoids becoming maudlin and mushy. The main characters grow, they develop, they change, they fight, they reconcile, they bond. That is stuff of which great stories are made and this movie has all of that.

56,ackstasis,"""I could have danced all night.""",8,15 February 2008,"Until now, I didn't know that a simple musical could be quite so epic. From the opening moments, it's obvious that producer Jack L. Warner threw a bucket-load of money into the project, paying a then-unprecedented $5.5 million for the adaptation rights alone, with a total production budget of around $17 million. Warner placed this money into the respected, capable hands of veteran director George Cukor  well known for producing ""women's pictures""  and Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn {in the role played on stage by Julie Andrews} were cast as the leads. Featuring extravagant set and costume design, and countless lengthy and elaborate musical sequences written by Alan Jay Lerner, the film tells a relatively straightforward story in just under three hours. Some have referred to the film as ""vacuous,"" which is a justified description, considering how very little happens in 170 minutes. However, more importantly, the story is rarely dull and 'My Fair Lady' remains a memorable, albeit rather exhausting, cinema experience.We first come across Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) as a poverty-stricken lady selling flowers on a crowded London street, her dishevelled hair and thick Cockney accent deeming her as unattractive as it is possible for Audrey Hepburn to appear {to such an extent that, for the first few minutes, I didn't realise who the actress actually was}. Huddled beneath a building pillar sits Professor Henry Higgins (Harrison), one of the world's leading linguists, an arrogant and impatient misogynist who bets Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), a fellow specialist from India, that, given just six months, he can pass off the pathetic flower vendor as an articulate, aristocratic duchess simply by teaching her how to properly speak the English language. Initially repulsed by the egotistical professor, Eliza is reluctant to spend six months in his company, but the promise of a better lifestyle proves overwhelming, and she arrives at his lonely mansion the following morning. Eliza's drunkard father, Alfred P. Doolittle (a wonderful Stanley Holloway) is at first insulted by the ""abduction"" of his primary source of whisky money, but is ignobly dissuaded from intervention by the payment of a mere five dollars.The storyline of 'My Fair Lady' is nothing particularly remarkable, and the simple tale of Eliza's Cinderella-like transformation could quite easily have been told  in non-musical form  in less than 90 minutes. However, the musical numbers, of which there are many, are among the most extravagant that I've seen. Songs such as ""With A Little Bit of Luck"" and ""Get Me to The Church on Time"" continue for far longer that you'd anticipate, but the optimists among us will maintain that this is simply offering the audience more of a good thing, and I'm rather inclined to agree. My favourite number would undoubtedly be Rex Harrison's passionate rendition of ""An Ordinary Man,"" a joyfully misogynistic {if misguided} love-letter towards the female sex. The continual alternation between a fast and slow tempo makes the song highly entertaining to follow, and Harrison's distinctive vocal style  a curious balance of traditional singing and conversation  appeals to his character's professional, educated background. George Cukor's film proved more successful than even Jack Warner could have hoped, sweeping the 1965 Academy Awards with an incredible eight wins from twelve nominations.",My Fair Lady
57,CubsandCulture,Delightful to watch but the ending doesn't work. Some scenes need to be tightened up.,7,20 November 2018,"While watching this film it is a extremely engaging delightful musical comedy that pokes fun at men trying to create the ideal woman and the underlying sexism of that. The film is smart enough to know that Henry Higgins is a jerk and mocks him almost as much as he mocks Eliza. ""Just you wait Henry Higgins"" does a lot of work to make sure Higgins' appalling behavior is contextualized correctly. Unfortunately, the film loses its nerve and inexplicably has Eliza return to him at the end for a conventional romantic ending. This choice (not shared by the Shaw play) undermines and make s the previous 3 hours to think about in context. Higgins simply didn't earn the happy ending.Apart from that the film is too long. I think the biggest offenders are some of the less critical songs (i.e. opening day at Ascot) could have been termed. Further, Cukor's habit of stopping the action by freezing the characters for a few second to bookmark songs is really grating and makes the film feel stagey, while causing the pace to be off. I am really surprised the studio allowed that.On the whole this is a pleasant film to watch. Rex Harrison is really funny in his misanthropy. The film is slick polished lush filmmaking.

Everyone knows (now) that Marni Nixon dubbed the songs for Miss Hepburn. OK, Audrey wasn't great at it. But she was pretty good. Ms. Nixon could belt it out with the best of them, and I'm not criticizing the decision to use her voice. There are a few comments in the DVD commentary that Miss Hepburn did not have the vocal range to do justice to the songs, and from what I heard I believe that's true. Of course the songs were written 8-10 years before the movie, and Julie Andrews, who played the role on the stage, could sing anything beautifully.

She is skillfully transformed into an elegant lady by a speech professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and taught to speak properly... From first frame to last, the film is slick, graceful, gorgeous to behold, with costumes and sets richly evoking the Edwardian era...'My Fair Lady' begins in London, on a rainy evening outside Covent Garden, where a 'respectable girl' is selling bouquets of violets... Professor Henry Higgins, a phonetics and linguistics expert, confronts the 'deliciously low so horribly dirty' Eliza Doolittle for the first time...In the best tradition, their first songs reveal their characters: 'Wouldn't It Be Loverly?' expresses Eliza's own ideas of what she dreams, while in 'Why Can't the English Learn to Speak' Higgins sings his despair over the deterioration of the English language, and displays his hard, irritable, intolerant, and elegantly arrogant nature...Lerner and Loewe's songs are shear delight as the story moves from Higgins's wager with sympathetic Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that he can change the street girl with a strong cockney accent into a different human being by teaching her 'to speak beautifully' and pass her off in an upper class lady within six months... Higgins and Pickering are both single men, and the housekeeper, Mrs. Pearce, has misgivings about the way in which they are proposing to amuse themselves without caring about the consequences for the ""common ignorant girl.""The songs are extraordinary in their ability to enrich our knowledge of the characters... Higgins' early song 'I'm an Ordinary Man' confirms that he is a 'quiet living man' without the need for a woman... Alfred Doolittle's 'With a Little Bit of Luck ' not only states his general philosophy of life, but exposes the perfect portrait of a friendly scoundrel... Eliza's father, who calls himself one of ""the undeserving poor"" is one of Shaw's best comedy creations... When he arrives to protest at the immorality of Higgins and Pickering treatment of his daughter, it soon becomes clear that he just wants to gain something for himself out of the situation... Eliza, becoming subject to Higgins' intimidation, belts out her discomfort at the rude, selfish Higgins, imagining a king ordering his death, in ""Just You Wait, 'Enry 'Iggins.""The music is also a logical extension of the characters' feelings... When Eliza finally pronounces impeccably: 'The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain,' Higgins can hardly believe what he has heard: ('By George, she's got it. Now once again, where does it rain?'), and Eliza ('On the plain! On the plain!') and Higgins simply cannot be contained ('And where's that soggy plain? ') Eliza responding: In Spain! In Spain! They sing a duet together to celebrate their success... The scene leads to one of the most triumphant sequences in musical history...Further, the stunning scene in which Eliza Doolittle appears in high society when she meets Higgins's mother (the impeccable Gladys Cooper), and attends the Ascot races... She instantly charms a young admirer Jeremy Brett (Freddy) by her slightly odd manner of speaking, who later haunts Higgins' house (""On the Street Where you Live"").The climax comes at the Embassy Ball, where Higgins' protégé, now ""an enchanting young lady"" charms everyone with her beauty... Her exercise is an unqualified success... Her waltz with the Queen's son, and other dance partners, spreads throughout the audience about her identity...Henry and Pickering are ecstatic... They congratulate each other for their ""glorious victory,"" ('You Did It'), but Eliza is hurt and angry at being ignored... They barely acknowledge her presence... She is no longer a part of any world... When Higgins returns for his slippers, which he has forgotten, Eliza flings them angrily at him, and voices her feelings: 'Oh, what's to become of me? What am I fit for?'In an attempt to find her true identity a frustrated Eliza encounters Freddy who declares his love for her, but she returns to the populated flower market outside Covent Garden, where no one recognizes her... Her own 'miserable' father - tuxedo-dressed - gives her the cheerful news that he is about to get married...In the closing scenes, Higgins is upset to discover Liza has left him and is led to wonder why 'can't a woman be more like a man? Men are so honest, so thoroughly square.' Eliza surprises Higgings with her decision to marry Freddie, and claims: 'I shall not feel alone without you. I can stand on my own without you. I can do bloody well 'Without you!'At his home, at dusk, Higgins ultimately recognizes Liza's quality... He recalls Liza and realizes how much she has come to mean to him... Without her, he is lost and lonely... The climax is a great ending to a great musical...'My Fair Lady' has great style and beauty... The film describes what is common in many societies... That accent determines the superficiality of class distinctions... The motion picture is humorous, notably the wonderfully steamy bath in which Prof. Higgens' female staff cleanses the accumulated dirt of the street off Eliza Doolittle...With the dazzling splendor that director George Cukor offers: the designer's eye for detail, the painter's flair for color, the artist's imagination, and the delicacy of handling, the film garnered no less than twelve Oscar nominations, and took home eight statuettes including Best Picture of the year, Best Actor- Harrison, Best Director- Cukor, as well as Best Art Decoration, Sound, Scoring, Costume Design, and color Cinematography...",My Fair Lady

63,MissSimonetta,The lackluster end of an era,6,29 June 2020,"MY FAIR LADY was among my first forays into Old Hollywood. I have seen it probably four or five times since high school. I've never been a big fan, but I remembered it with a fondness that gave way to disappointment when I rewatched it again recently and found it a letdown in just about every aspect. About all this film has going for it are good songs and great dialogue from the original George Bernard Shaw play, PYGMALION. It is every bit a victim of the time of its production: in the 50s and 60s, Hollywood panicked as it lost audiences to television, so they decided to make movies larger than life and dripping with spectacle.Unfortunately, spectacle does not suit a witty satire like this: it just pads out the runtime unnecessarily. And besides, the spectacle we get isn't even that good. For some reason, I recall thinking this was a movie graced with beautiful art direction, but watching it again, I was shocked by how drab everything looks. The predominant colors are brown and green. Combined with the fussy sets and some truly garish costumes (with the exception of Eliza's ascot dress and ball gown), the movie's aesthetic appeal is nil, foreshadowing the predominantly beige look of the botched 1967 CAMELOT. Even worse, the sound mixing and dubbing are atrocious, going beyond just the obvious gulf between the movement of Hepburn's lips and Marni Nixon's singing. The sound is tinny and so obviously separate from the action on-screen that it becomes distracting.The only actors who leave much of an impression are Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway, both resuming roles they made famous during the show's original Broadway run. Audrey Hepburn's performance was and remains divisive, but-- and as much as it pains me to say it-- I have to agree with the naysayers, she is badly miscast. I just do not buy her as the squalid flower girl at all: her crassness feels labored, more like a parody than anything and often more annoying than I think it's supposed to come across. She coasts on her charm at least. Still, it shocks me that this is considered one of her signature performances: even if I didn't think the Oscars were a joke, I wouldn't say she was snubbed at all.And to parrot a common complaint once again: that ending is awful. I don't think the movie is misogynist as others claim-- there are small hints in Harrison's performance that he has softened and his final line is delivered in a self-mocking manner that does not suggest Eliza will be a domestic slave. However, the characters and the actors both share zero romantic chemistry, no matter how much both the script and the actors try to hint at such feelings. The original play had it right: Eliza becomes her own woman and probably marries Freddy, a man that, while much less interesting to the audience than Higgins, at least respects Eliza. Whether or not the two last hardly matters-- Eliza's emancipation is the end goal, not the question of which man she may or may not marry.As it is, MY FAIR LADY is one of the last true Old Hollywood productions. In a few short years, New Hollywood would burst onto the scene with its violence, moral ambiguity, and cinematic boldness, eclipsing the stately mega productions the old-time moguls kept trying to foist onto audiences even after the appeal of such films cooled at the box office. In that sense, there is a poignancy to MY FAIR LADY that makes me unable to outright dislike it, despite its many shortcomings. After all, it does have some good songs and some moments of charm, even if one is left wishing it could have had more life pumped into it.",My Fair Lady
64,slokes,Flower Girl Power,9,24 April 2005,"Most musicals are sappy. Even when the songs are good, they often lack an interesting plot, or are filled with shallow characters or stupid attempts at comedy. So a movie like ""My Fair Lady"" that has a great story, deep characters, a terrific score, belly laughs front to back, is worth treasuring even if it isn't so much a movie as a straightforward transposition, with one notable exception in the casting, of a classic stage musical to film.That one exception makes for a lot of difference, not to mention much of the debate to be seen in this comments section. To wit, it is the issue of why Hollywood decided to replace the stage Eliza, rising star Julie Andrews, with gamine clotheshorse Audrey Hepburn.I've never really been a big Hepburn fan. Most of her screen performances leave me cold. Andrews was the voice on the Broadway album I grew up with and loved, especially her performances of ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"" and ""Show Me."" Yet for me, ""My Fair Lady"" biggest strength as a movie is Hepburn's brave, hilarious performance in the title role. Even though she may not sing more than a couple of verses herself, she shines in her pantomime like a silent-film clown. She nails her Cockney character's voice so well that when she turns into a princess, it feels like a genuine transformation rather than Hepburn's reversion to form. She sells the simple joy and grace of Eliza so well, it seems to me like Hepburn was underutilized for most of her career trading cool come-hither banter with the likes of George Peppard.Otherwise, this is the same production that wowed London and Broadway theatergoers, with Rex Harrison in his signature role as phonetics professor Henry Higgins, Stanley Holloway as Eliza's amoral father, and the great Lerner-Loewe score. Even the set design and staging seems to have been transferred with little alteration. The only difference is the camera-work, which bathes in the sumptuous spectacle even if it seems a little herky-jerky with the jump cuts.The flaws are minor, though, and don't detract from the joy of one of the best screen musicals. The film slows down in the final third, yet that's also the time we get the gems ""Get Me To The Church On Time,"" ""Show Me,"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face."" The pace is sluggish, but there is such depth to the script its hard to mind too much. I love the many casual cruelties Eliza is put through. ""You simply cannot keep working the woman this way, saying her alphabet from sunup to sundown, even during meals,"" complains Higgins' maid. ""You'll exhaust yourself."" People may complain about misogyny in ""My Fair Lady,"" but it's all a send-up, and of course Higgins is wearing the target. Anyone sincerely watching ""My Fair Lady"" to see men getting the upper hand in the war of the sexes is like watching a John Wayne movie rooting for the Indians.Ultimately, this is a great musical faithfully reproduced on stage, with the glorious bonus of a sublime lead performance by Audrey Hepburn. Not singing her own songs may have cost her an Oscar nomination, but I have it on good authority that the Best Actress winner that year didn't do her own flying in ""Mary Poppins.""",My Fair Lady
65,Steffi_P,"""Show me now""",10,26 June 2010,"Musicals, even the most intelligently crafted and critically appreciated, tend be looked down upon by ""serious"" film commentators these days. The most successful ones tend to come up for flack in any of those predictable Oscar-bashing articles, My Fair Lady in particular having committed the mortal sin of winning several awards over a certain Stanley Kubrick film. One of the charges most often levelled at the major musicals is that they are too frivolous, too removed from real issues, and that by having characters bursting into song they are ""breaking"" with reality. But this is cinema, a medium which has been breaking with reality since Georges Melies first turned a camera crank.But the real problem these musical-scorners have is that they clearly haven't really watched the movies in question properly. My Fair Lady tells a deeply intelligent and relevant story. Of course, a lot of this is thanks to the source play by George Bernard Shaw, which says things about snobbery that society is only just starting to learn, and things about chauvinism that it has yet to. With all the towering dramatic power of Shaw's words intact between the songs (and, by the way, most of the differences with the original play are those Shaw himself approved for the 1938 adaptation), this remains impressive, engaging and relevant story.However, it might seem foolhardy to insert someone else's material (viz. the musical numbers of Lerner and Loewe) into something already so perfect. Sometimes this might be the case, but the merging of two or more great minds, even when separated by a few decades, needn't always be disastrous. After all, Shakespeare and Dickens are continually being reworked, often with good results, aren't they? Now, Frederick Loewe wrote some magnificent tunes, but the real genius of the duo was lyricist Alan Jay Lerner. Lerner of course had a style all his own so we do make transitions from text to lyric. But although his wonderful way with words is not the same as Shaw's (nor would we want him to ape Shaw), he does have a knack for nailing the tone and character of whatever material he turns his hand to. The end result is neither authentically Shavian or wholly Lerner-ish, but is a workable blend that respects the integrity of both.Lerner's use and placement of songs is particularly neat. For him every song is a not a tonal commentary on the story – it is the continuation of it. Songs reveal characters' feelings about a situation, for example I Could Have Danced All Night and I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face being Eliza and Higgins respectively admitting to themselves their feelings for each other. Songs can even literally take up the narrative, such as the ""Budapest-ruder pest"" section of You Did It. The lyrics become poetic but never totally fanciful elaborations on whatever dialogue would normally be spoken in those circumstances. In this light, the approach taken by Rex Harrison to his songs is particularly apt. Harrison speaks in pitch rather than singing his lyrics; speaking in pitch being a skill in itself. He is totally sensitive to the meter and dynamics of the music, and even begins to work the rhythm of each song into his dialogue just before the number begins. It's this, amongst many other things, that merited Harrison's Oscar win for best actor.Throughout, this is an incredibly tight production. George Cukor directs with his usual precision of carefully timed movements. It's worth noting how the choreography here does not consist of dances in the strictest sense, but are in fact continuations of a character's normal business – exaggerated and rhythmic, yet not containing anything that could be called a dance step. So during Let a Woman in Your Life, Harrison angrily paces about the house, picking up and putting down bits of equipment. I'm Getting Married in the Morning charts the progress of Stanley Holloway's stag night. Little bits of realism are even used as rhythmic counterpoints, such as a streetlamp being lit in the background during a highpoint of On the Street Where You Live. The superb arrangements of scorer Andre Previn turn little snatches of Loewe's melody into little leitmotifs which crop up to remind us of a certain strand in the story. All this again ties in to Lerner's style of making songs a seamless part of narrative. In My Fair Lady, the numbers are not breaks with reality, they are embellishments upon drama.Ironically, it was a chink in the authenticity of My Fair Lady that resulted in a glaring omission at the Oscars. Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated for her performance. Admittedly it is not her best, but she adapts herself well to the genre and the less dignified aspects of the character, so it is surprising she did not at least get a nod. The reason may well be that her singing voice was dubbed by professional vocalist Marni Nixon. Bear in mind the Nixon dubbing job on Deborah Kerr in The King and I a decade earlier was a well-kept secret and she did get nominated. By 1964 such things were not so well hidden and performances that were in some way propped up by anyone else were frowned upon. In what almost looks like a cheeky snub the Best Actress award went to Julie Andrews, who had originated Eliza on the stage, and had done her own singing for Mary Poppins. However, Miss Hepburn, along with Stanley Holloway and various bit players at least sound like bona fide cockneys, unlike a certain co-star of Miss Andrews...",My Fair Lady
66,rbverhoef,Lovely,9,28 April 2003,"If somebody forced me to choose an all-time favorite actress I think it would be Audrey Hepburn. As soon as she is in a movie it is already enjoyable. Classics like 'Roman Holiday , 'Charades' and 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' belong to my favorites, 'My Fair Lady' comes pretty close.This movie musical, with some very nice songs, shows us a Audrey Hepburn as a very poor girl, selling flowers for a living. Her name is Eliza Doolittle. A man, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) bets with Col. Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that he can make her presentable in high society within six months. Basically this is the story.The movie is a bit too long in the beginning although there are some nice laughs. After she has moved in with Henry and Col. Pickering the movie really starts. It is funny, with nice songs and great performances. I think it is too bad that the singing voice of Hepburn was dubbed, but still the movie has enough Hepburn to enjoy. Again she is so lovely and so very beautiful. Together with her performance and the performances of Rex Harrison, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Stanley Halloway as the father of Eliza and Gladys Cooper as the mother of Higgins this is a great movie.",My Fair Lady

69,Spleen,One reason to watch it: Rex Harrison,6,23 January 2000,"Okay, so he sounds as if he couldn't actually SING to save his life, but he doesn't need to.  Unlike Stanley Holloway.  The latter actor - and what's his character there for, anyway? - grinds out `Get Me to the Church on Time' in such an unmusical fashion that you want to snatch the melody out of his mouth and hand it to someone else.But ah, Rex Harrison.  We don't even need to hear what the tunes ARE in order to appreciate his songs - so long as we have Loewe's assurance that there IS a tune there, somewhere, underneath the brilliant patter.  No-one but Harrison could have made the material quite so funny.  (Not that Lerner's lyrics aren't funny in themselves - much wittier than you might expect from what too many people think of as a soft, twilight-of-Broadway musical.)Indeed, Professor Higgins was the only character I really cared for.  He's an intelligent Bohemian trapped in Victorian England.  How could anyone NOT like him?  And how could anyone's sympathy reside with Eliza?  Higgins won ME over, at any rate, in less than a second; while Eliza spends so much of the film playing the dying swan that I quite understand why the professor loses patience with her.  (And as someone who's seen `Breakfast at Tiffany's' and `Charade' I'm perfectly willing to fall in love with Audrey Hepburn, under the right circumstances.)It took me three attempts to make it through `My Fair Lady' to the end.  At the start of the falling out between Henry and Eliza I was unable to - emotionally, at any rate - take Eliza's side; and I foresaw ENDLESS fuffing about before the slender plot would be resolved.  I was right on that count. `Ponderous' is correct.  We must endure an awful lot as the film crawls its way to an obvious conclusion (and then stops abruptly).  But I'm glad I put up with it all, because otherwise I wouldn't have gotten the full effect of Rex Harrison's performance.  It IS marvellous.",My Fair Lady

George Cukor whose career is spotty but has many highlights, directed a hopelessly interiorized, absolutely by-the-books clunker which was probably a safe bet, given the legions of musical fans who dependably lie in wait to shriek about the travesty of any minor change to a popular play (and given that it won Best Picture).But just because it won that award, doesn't mean the establishment values of the era have made it intact into our own. They definitely haven't. Giving this movie the Oscar was political; it comforted some powerful Hollywood grey-hairs, and helped them believe their values,not the upstart youth culture would be projected into the future. They were wrong about that too.The harpies who are still whining that Julie Andrews didn't get the role (in this or Camelot), should get over it.

But when we watch together the ""Opening Ascot races"" scene in ""My Fair Lady"" with its harmony in white, black and gray that, surprisingly, have so many shades and nuances, and then the harmony gets slightly distorted by Henry Higgins's brown suit, and then, as apotheosis, Eliza appears in the incredible black/white dress with a tiny red bow, the stroke of a visual genius, which completes this harmonic feast of colors, we both feel the magic.

We see a refined and distrustful professor, Henry Higgins, who is cynical of everyone around him. From his maid, his close friends and even a simple unknown flower girl. As an accomplished and intelligent professor he is snobbish and part of high society. He is so confident in his abilities that he easily accepts a wager to change the flower girl he just made into a respectable lady. The acting from Rex Harrison deserves high praise, it is effortless and believable. The same can be said for Audrey Hepburn who plays the role of a low class person to perfection. We are also treated to first class music and performances from the cast, musicals never seemed so enjoyable. We see Henry teach Eliza how to be a lady and their constant quarrels. The experiment is such a success that high society is none the wiser as to her transformation. However Audrey feels like a prize or object in a rich white man's game. More importantly despite his success, the experience of tutoring Eliza has humbled him.

77,DeeNine-2,"Wonderful, but I missed Julie Andrews",9,8 July 2002,"I thought the music was wonderful. I thought Audrey Hepburn was just adorable and so full of energy and grace and just fascinating to watch. Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character. My problem (a minor one) is with the ending and with the dubbing.The story is brilliant of course, taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion, although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy. The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy, self-possessed confirmed bachelor, a kind of nineteenth century British man of science, wonderfully accomplished in his profession, but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people, made for a most interesting match. And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman (which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend) works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl. The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.But there are some problems. Freddy is needed of course as another ""objectifying"" character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing this--in theory, of course, because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza, this would seem entirely unnecessary. And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful ""On the Street Where You Live."" But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see, and indeed even at the resolution of the story, he still does not see, as he asks for his slippers. If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written. Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!The dubbing and the need for it is curious. There is no doubt that Marni Nixon, who did the singing, has a beautiful and commanding voice, and we are the better for having heard her, but why is the dubbing so obvious? It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience: they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained. And so Hepburn does not completely lip-sync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing. And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious. Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews, who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon, and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn, wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage. Still, as another reviewer has so acutely noted, if she had been asked, we would have missed her in Mary Poppins, which was made the same year. I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made (although she looked almost ten years younger). Nonetheless she was playing the part of ""a good girl, I am,"" whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.Curious. But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful, so elegant and so delightful in the part. I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice. By the way, I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part, although I never saw her on the stage, and the way she ""meow's"" Eliza's accent, like a cat's claw on a chalk board, is really amazing. (Get the CD.)This is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a sheer delight highlighted not only by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, but by Stanley Holloway as the Liza's lovable rascal father and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the very understanding and very properly British Col. Pickering with opulent direction by the great George Cukor. The sets and production numbers are gorgeous. But see it for Audrey Hepburn, one of the great stars of the silver screen in one of her most memorable roles.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

78,sme_no_densetsu,Loverly? Abso-Bloomin'-Lutely!,9,26 January 2008,"I'm not much of a fan of movie musicals. I mainly took a chance on this one because I knew that it was an influence on Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame, specifically in terms of the creation of the Stewie Griffin character. Now, having watched the movie, I am very glad that I did.Musically, the film is exceptional. There's no shortage of memorable melodies and all are augmented with clever lyrics. There are no throwaway songs, either. Whenever a character segues into song it is always relevant to the storyline.Likewise, the acting is top-notch. This is the role that Rex Harrison was born to play. Ditto Stanley Holloway. Audrey Hepburn is exquisite. I could go on but I'd end up listing just about everyone who had more than a few lines.The visuals are breathtaking. Among others, the movie won Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design & Best Director, all of which were well-deserved.At the core of all of this is a compelling storyline that fills nearly three hours with ease. Outwardly, the film is a 'Cinderella story' though the script is rife with subtle commentary on class distinctions. However, the ending may put off some since it is deliberately vague. I don't think that there's a right answer to the question ""What happens next?"", though others are more than willing to jump to conclusions.To sum it up, this movie is proof of the old adage ""They don't make 'em like they used to"".",My Fair Lady
79,frankde-jong,From the golden age of Musical,8,11 August 2019,"""My fair lady"" (1964, George Cukor) is a film with a long history. It is inspired by the musical from 1956, which in turn was based on the play ""Pygmalion"" (1912, George Bernhard Shaw). Finally the name ""Pygmalion"" refers to an old Greek myth. In ""My fair lady"" Professor Higgins picks up a poor flower girl and makes a bet to his friend Pickering that he can change her (Cockney) accent so that she can show up on high society events like balls and the horse races of Ascot.I rewatched ""My fair lady"" in connection with ""Pretty woman"" (1990, Garry Marshall). In my memory the themes behind the two story's were very much the same. In ""Pretty woman"" the story can be summarized as follows.1) A man picks up a woman with a much lower social status.
2) This man tries to uplift / dignify this woman.
3) In the end she rather changes him instead of the other way around.Having seen ""My fair lady"" for the second time I have my doubts about the resemblance of the story lines. Only point 2 is clearly the same. Below some comments on the points 1 and 3.In ""Pretty woman"" the difference in social status (point 1) is mainly attributable to wealth. In ""My fair lady"" it seems to be education and maybe intelligence. On second thought however the difference in social status is due to a different accent. Given the fact that an accent is something you acquire at a young age and is then difficult to get rid of, this can be seen as a comment on the rigid English class society.In ""Pretty woman"" we have a perfect happy end with businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) totally recovered from his greed (point 3). In ""My fair lady"" the end is much more ambiguous. Professor Higgins (Rex Harrison) is certainly missing his flowergirl turned into a lady Eliza (Audrey Hepburn), but is he missing his toy or is he missing the woman. His famous last line ""Eliza? Where the devil are my slippers?"" gives something to think about. The ending of the Greek myth of Pygmalion is less ambiguous than the film. The sculptor Pygmalion at first prefers to create a woman out of marble but than asks the Gods to change her in a woman of flesh and blood.The cast of the 1964 film was more or less the same as the cast of the 1956 musical, with one exception. Julie Andrews, playing Eliza in the musical, was thought to have too little film experience. She took revenge by winning an Oscar for her role in ""Mary Poppins"" (1964, Robert Stevenson). This unfortunate act of casting threws a shadow over the performance of Audrey Hepburn. In my opinion unjustified.""My fair lady"" has some marvelous songs in it, such as ""Wouldn't it be lovely"" and ""With a little bit of luck"" (to name just a few). Some songs have a habit of recurring in the course of the movie. ""Wouldn.t it be lovely"" is heared again when Eliza (as a lady) returns to the market where she used to sell flowers , and nobody recognizes her anymore. There are more instances of such symmetry, and they demonstrate how clever the film has been build up. When Eliza has her first appearance in the ""high society"", Higgins orders her to only talk about the weather. When Higgins and Eliza are having a fight at the end of the film the mother of Higgins orders him to only talk about the weather when she let the two of them alone.",My Fair Lady
80,pyrocitor,Mansplaining: The Musical,6,21 August 2016,"""Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot!"" So boomed George Bernard Shaw, upon witnessing the ending of Pygmalion, his slashing satire of class and gender disparities, changed from its original intent. In Shaw's words, leading lady Eliza Doolittle ended the play by proudly walking out on Professor Henry Higgins, her sneering tutor. To Shaw's chagrin, subsequent performances had twisted the climax into a more populist, albeit disingenuously romantic, 'happy ending.' Flash-forward forty years, by the time My Fair Lady, the filmic revival of the now beloved Broadway musical, was released, audiences would have expected nothing less. And yet, for a show heralded as ""the perfect musical,"" it's startling how, nostalgic haze aside, how many of the film's attributes have aged poorly to the point of being resoundingly un-fair - none the least, that 'damnable' ending itself. This isn't to say that the film is worthy of the kind of lambasting Higgins bestows upon Eliza, upon first glimpsing her in her unrefined, working class inelegance (ahh, romance). Granted, for one of the defining directors of the Classical Hollywood screwball era, George Cukor's work here is thoroughly sleepy, with the skeletal plot lumbering along with such an unhurried dopiness that an hour could easily have been shaved off the running time without batting an eye. Even the songs, unforgettably catchy as they are, are staged with an oddly docile tentativeness. Even the most iconic tunes come across as shy and tentative rather than the lively vivaciousness they warrant. Where Cukor really perks up is in mischievously digging into the show's social critique, lambasting English high society's priggish, disinterested disdain for the less fortunate with gleeful abandon. Sure, the endless montages of Higgins' antiquated speech language pathology turned sadistic psychological torture bring their share of comedic relief, but the film's brightest, most engaging moment is its central horse race scene, where droves of virtually sleepwalking society men and women raise and lower their opera glasses in synch like cows chewing their cuds, just waiting to be shaken up by Eliza Doolittle's feisty bull in a china shop. Similarly, Cukor spares no expense in costume and set design, as the two diametrically opposed social stations - the grungy London ghetto and prim society balls - look gorgeously, spectacularly vivid in their own respects. Tranquilized execution or not, there's no denying the film's 'loverlyness,' and it carries enough charm to keep afloat, especially when punctuated by welcome moments of acrid, Shawsian wit. Ah yes - but then there's that romance, boldly paving the way for decades of romanticized unhealthy relationships in a way that even Grease's 'change everything for your man!' climax would shudder at. It's certainly no fault of the performers. Hepburn herself is an absolute effervescent delight, as Eliza's course roots allow her to gleefully cast off her tried and true airs of consummate elegance with a hysterical, sparky firebrand of a performance, Monty Python cockney accent and all (it's a shame she wasn't allowed to contribute her own singing, as the unnecessary dubbing during musical numbers is detrimentally distracting). Similarly, Rex Harrison's nimble elocution and pristinely condescending eyebrows light up Henry Higgins' monolithic misogyny with a sneering charisma that makes him distressingly hard to hate, even at his most loathsome. In fact, therein lies the film's most unshakeable concern: Higgins is so farcically abhorrent to Eliza throughout that it's impossible for his third act romantic about-face not to play as just as grotesque, abusive and controlling. Different direction or actor interpretation could have teased out nuances of redemptive shame in Higgins' transformation (there's even an arguable undercurrent of Higgins as a closeted homosexual fighting for societal or matriarchal validation through heteronormative normalcy - ""Why can't a woman be more like a man,"" anyone?). Instead, Harrison plays him as so deliciously, unrelentingly despicably throughout that we're eager for him to get a colossal comeuppance, not a simperingly happy ending. Seldom has so sharp and sweet a film ended on such an uncomfortably false note - even Hepburn's face and body language are saturated with this uneasiness in her purportedly cute final appearance - and it can't help but taint the entire film as consequence. Loverly 'dis ain't. Guaarrn. This isn't all to say that your childhood is ruined, and My Fair Lady is an unredeemable write-off - it's fun, frilly, and peppered with moments both delightful and dastardly witty. Still, contemporary gender politics haven't been kind to this one, and it's important to contextualize how uneasy and unsatisfying a watch the film is amidst its many delights. We've grown accustomed to its face, but that shouldn't excuse the scowl it works hard to hide under its prettiness. -6/10",My Fair Lady

It's similar to the treatment forced on those whose sexual orientation didn't conform to the views of the 'holier than thou', and therein lies the paradox, with the prof and his colonel chum. Weighing in at an almighty 170 minutes, you can remove Eliza's father from the scene as he adds nothing to the story, excepting a song about the imminent demise of an individuals freedom. Nothing wrong with Eliza's aspirations and Audrey Hepburn is delightful, although it was education not enunciation she needed and, after twenty years without a bath, delicing, steroids and some powerful antibiotics.

82,Philby-3,A shining musical example - but no-one makes them any more,9,13 March 2006,"Well, this is definitely my favourite musical. Forty years after it was released it still sparkles. The negative was restored in 1994 and it was a new print that I saw recently on TV. In devising the lyrics Alan J Lerner stuck fairly closely to the original ""Pygmalion"" script, thus much as Shaw would have hated it, his astringent words are sung as much as they are spoke. The movie is virtually the 1956 stage musical filmed, but George Cukor gives it a sheen a Broadway producer would be hard put to emulate (not to mention real horses at Ascot).Rex Harrison as Higgins was as I remember him, supremely self-confident and self-centred, with very hardworking eyebrows. But Audrey Hepburn as Eliza, who is not a very convincing flower girl, is more beautiful than I remember, and she is a real lady when the time comes for her to be one. There is almost too much Alfred Doolittle, though he has a couple of the best songs, but the great music hall veteran Stanley Holloway has the role down pat. As for the rest of the cast, they are all fine.My only beef is about the ending. In ""Pygmalion"" as first produced as a play in 1914, Eliza does not return to Henry Higgins, but goes off to marry the handsome, love-struck but vacuous Freddy. Shaw explained this in a postscript. When ""Pygmalion' was filmed by Gabriel Pascal in 1937, this ending was altered so that in the last scene so that Eliza appears at the doorway just as Henry is hunting for his slippers. Shaw, it seems, hated this but permitted it because at least there was the possibility she might not stay. In My ""Fair Lady"" this second ending is used, but somehow Eliza seems to be back for good.I think Shaw got it right. Eliza and Henry are not a romantic couple. Apart from the age gap, he is such a vain and self-centred man that only a woman who wanted to be a doormat would consider him. Eliza is tough, streetwise and assertive. The relationship would be a disaster. On the other hand, she and Freddy the male bimbo could be very happy together if they could achieve some financial security. With Pickering's help there could be a flower shop, the business Eliza knows so well, and there would be no need for Freddy to run off with a social climbing heiress from New York.It amazes me how well this production, campy and mannered though it is, stands up after 40 years. It has ""good bones""  Shaw's basic plot  Lowe's excellent music, fine acting and truly great production values. The day of the musical seems to be long over, but this film continues as a shining example of the genre. Never did three hours go so fast.",My Fair Lady
83,classicalsteve,Magical Adaptation of One of the Best Broadway Musicals of All Time,10,17 October 2007,"Among the many Hollywood efforts to convert Broadway hit musicals into movies, the best adaptation of them all may be ""My Fair Lady"". And, believe it or not, the success of the movie may be in large part due to Cary Grant--not for what he did but for what he didn't do. The studio originally wanted Grant as Prof Higgins rather than Rex Harrison. (They had already passed on Julie Andrews as Eliza.) However, Grant insisted that Harrison, who so convincingly played the brilliant but amoral professor of phonetics in the original Broadway stage production, was the hands down choice for the part. Grant also threatened that if they didn't cast Harrison, the screen icon would never work for Hollywood again! Sometimes Hollywood has to be nudged a little to make the appropriate decision.The fact is, without Harrison, the movie would have suffered. Instead, what lives on today is a movie musical that is as fresh, funny, and insightful as it was 40 years ago at its release. At first glance, the premise is a kind of Cinderella story with a brash self-centered professor as the Fairy Godmother. The movie centers around a lower-class flower girl from East London, Eliza Dolittle played with dazzling innocent charm by the incomparable Audrey Hepburn, who sports a brash cockney accent that could give Frankenstein's monster a run for his money. The story is about her transformation from lower-class insignificant into upper-class ""lady"" of substance that can handle herself at social functions, mainly as the result of language lessons from a heartless scholar of phonetics.Behind this seemingly tame premise, originally written with caustic wit by the inventive George Bernard Shaw, is a biting satire on relationships, the meaning and power of phonetics, and the inequities of class in early 20th-century England. Many of the themes of ""My Fair Lady"" hearken back to prejudice, and how speech may open or close doors of particular social circles.The most unsympathetic character is Professor Henry Higgins, who accepts the challenge to work with Eliza. His lack of empathy for the uneducated Eliza is as brash as her cockney speech. He pushes her beyond reasonable limits and exhibits not a shred of kindness toward his pupil. Tempering Higgins is the honorable Colonel Pickering who appears the only character to truly empathize with Eliza's difficulties and tries to persuade the professor not to push the girl beyond her capabilities. In the end, Eliza comes to respect Pickering much more than Higgins. To his credit, Higgins despises the class distinctions and expresses his distaste for the cockney accent as a means of identifying those in the lower class with the song ""Why Can't the English Learn to Speak?"" Simultaneously, when Hepburn begins to succeed at her task, Higgins gives all the credit to himself and some to Pickering, as if they were solely responsible for Eliza's transformation. They act as if Eliza had nothing to with it.The story works just about every level. The only sequence that is overlong and has little to do with the story concerns Eliza's father, Alfred Dolittle, getting married in an endless number called ""Get Me to the Church on Time"". Why is it that the most pointless numbers of movie musicals always seem to be the longest? Screen adaptations of Broadway hit musicals have been largely a mixed bunch with some recapturing the wonder of the magic of the original live production while others have fallen agonizingly short. The movie equivalent of ""Oaklahoma"", ""The Sound of Music"", and ""Fiddler on the Roof"" rank among the better adaptations. ""The Man of La Mancha"", ""Camelot"", and ""Westside Story"" failed to reprise on the large screen the enchanting brilliance that occurred on stage. Often these are due to compromises in either the original script and/or the talent. The movie ""Camelot"" changed the tone and some of the script of the original show and recast Richard Harris in the lead as King Arthur instead of Richard Burton. Peter O'Toole had remarked on the inadequacy of the sets of ""Man of La Mancha"". And many have criticized the film adaption of ""West Side Story"" as misrepresenting the Puerto Ricans. As it is, My Fair Lady reigns as one of the best of all time.",My Fair Lady

He is snotty to women of what he thinks is the lower class.Henry is old, but unmarried and childless. Who could live with him, anyway? Mama tries to set him straight, but he is too stubborn.Henry is an obnoxious, selfish misogynist. His life revolves around his bratty self. Pygmalion, indeed. Pulling the strings, eh? End of my rant about stupid Henry Higgins.Now on to my observations about lovely Audrey Hepburn. Her pink outfit and matching hat are just divine. Freddy is a really cute number. Eliza jumps all over the vegetable cart with such divine movement and timing. She is joyously happy to be alive.Eliza's white ball costume is just divine. Her hair updo is just scrumptious. She even convinces the Theodore Bikel character that she is real royalty (???). I think Eliza surprised Henry and Colonel Pickering more than they thought that she would. Their creation became super popular. Henry and Pickering who? Pickering was an actual gentleman, opposed to Henry who was a childish, spoiled brat.Final scene: Henry ordering Eliza around, to pick up his slippers. What a moron. Get them yourself, you stupid idiot. Whatsa matter? Mama not around to pick up after you? Get a life. Who would want to marry you, anyway? I still liked this movie. It is a family favorite, for eons. The flower girl did succeed in shoveling it to old Henry. She was capable of being out on her own now.From clothing, I would guess the time period would be around 1910-1912. World War One was just around the corner. Henry would have still been studying obscure dialects, lost in his goofy nitwit cloud of oblivious nonchalance.The singing and dancing: you know that they are my favorites. So what if some singing is dubbed. It is still a wonderful show. Some characters even talked-sang.Still a 10/10.",My Fair Lady

Harrison is as authoritative here as he had been throughout the musical's long stage run; Hepburn, somewhat shaky as a cockney flower girl, comes into her own with a vengeance in the second half, when she becomes a lady. And of course, a good three-quarters of the songs are unforgettable. The film won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director.",My Fair Lady
87,gab-14712,"A Magical, Old-Fashioned Spectacle!",9,20 March 2020,"1964's My Fair Lady is one joyful musical and that may be too negative of a description. It certainly deserves all the accolades it received in 1964-1965 and even today. It's a magical, romantic movie about how opposites attract. It's very weird to call this movie a romance because of the actions that take place in the film. There are no kisses, no wooing, none of that fancy stuff.....but undeniably, love is in the air. The songs are enchanting and the performances from Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are nothing short of fantastic. Sure, modernists may raise some issues about Harrison's treatment of Hepburn's character, but this is how it was back during these times. Even so, there are some creative lines of dialogue that makes Harrison's character a bit more sympathetic.Many of you may not know this, but this film has some Greek story behind these words and songs. Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Lowe adapted this story from the 1912 film, Pygmalion. That film had a story that started as a Greek legend and retold in every era, all the way until the present 1964 feature. The music these gentlemen created for the movie are memorable in their own way. Two songs stand out. ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly,"" which is about the dreams of Eliza (played by Hepburn) and the one song that everyone knows, ""The Rain in Spain..."" which is a triumphal duet between the main characters.The movie also had an expert director overseeing the movie. This director is none other than George Cukor. He made this film vibrant and dazzling as he possibly could have. The colors will catch your eye, and the beauty of the set design would want you to embrace this world with your own imagination. I also loved the costumes. When we see Eliza portrayed as an upper-class woman for the first time, my mind was absolutely blown away. Her dress is magnificent!The premise of the movie is actually quite simple. Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is a misanthrope which essentially means he dislikes everyone and everything! But the biggest thing (or person) that gets on his nerve is the dirty, cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn). He despises the way she speaks and the way she mispronounces words, in his harsh opinion. He takes a bet from his good friend Colonel Hugh Pickering (Wilford Hyde-White). This bet forces the Professor to try and turn Eliza into a lady. If he succeeds, what will high society think of her? Will Higgins be less disdainful?The performances from both Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are magical. Their characters are complete opposites yet they both have wonderful chemistry together. Despite their strong performances, it does take some time to get used to them. You may be familiar with Rex Harrison from the original Doctor Dolittle film and he is a great actor, but it is kind of hard to get behind such a selfish character at first. Audrey Hepburn is beautiful, but one can admit her original Cockney accent is a little irritable. But the performances from these two were able to wash away any concerns I had. I also thought Wilford Hyde-White provided some witty banter and also Gladys Cooper as Higgin's mother also delivers a great performance.There is some good trivia associated with the movie and the biggest trivia fact is that Audrey Hepburn does not do her own singing except during a small reprise. Her voice was not deemed good enough for the film so there was a stand-in who did all the singing. That said, the music is great. The songs are cheerful, melodic, and extremely memorable.I am not a linguist (even though I studied basic linguistics) and I know teaching accents/vocabulary is not something that happens overnight, so be prepared to bring some imagination into the film. This is an old-school musical about love-and one that is not even seen in Hollywood these days. In fact, the political spectrum (involving Stanley Holloway as Eliza's poor father) would have been cut. Admittedly, I did find myself charmed with the politics.If you like musicals, bright and colorful films, long films, or all of the above, then The Fair Lady is the film for you. It may not be to everyone's taste, but it certainly gave me something to remember!My Grade: A-",My Fair Lady

89,spookyrat1,Cukor's Career Summit!,9,3 July 2019,"George Cukor had a long distinguished career in Hollywood, culminating in achieving almost unanimous critical and huge commercial success with this extremely faithful adaption of the enormously successful Broadway musical; itself based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion. After winning 8 Academy Awards including best picture and director, many would support the contention, that this success was entirely justified and overdue, considering his earlier arguably unfair sacking from Gone With the Wind by producer David O Selznick, after contributing greatly to its production.Cukor had a reputation for eliciting fine performances from his leads and My Fair Lady is no exception. The almost 3 hour film is dominated by the characters of grumpy linguist Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and socially aspiring street urchin come flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), who both excel in the ultimate romance realised after an extended comic, gender warfare scenario. Hepburn was widely criticised for being cast instead of Julie Andrews, a far superior singer famed for making the stage role of Eliza her own, though never accepted as film star material by producer Jack L Warner. No matter! Even though Andrews' angelic voice is missed by those familiar with the extremely popular Broadway recording, Hepburn's acting skills in interpreting the transformation of Eliza from whiney Cockney to a resplendent, independently-thinking woman cannot be faulted.The production and art design is outstanding in a film that features no exteriors. All the London locations are recreated impressively on Warner Bros sound stages. But crucially Cukor and his team which included cinematographer Harry Stradling Snr and Art Director/Costume Designer Cecil Beaton, avoid giving the impression, the production is just a filmed play. Instead they create the perfect environments to record memorable musical and mannered dancing sequences such as the Ascot Gavette and the Ambassador's Ball, where Lerner's and Lowe's songs are supremely realised in sumptuous settings, peopled with a cast invariably stylishly and alluringly and colourfully costumed.One point of criticism may be made around the film's pace. Much as Stanley Holloway's Alfie Doolittle is beloved, as are his two featured song and dance numbers, his extended songless interlude at Higgins's house in an attempt to extort money, has little really to do with the main storyline and means the charismatic Hepburn is offscreen for an appreciably noticeable time. One feels more refined editing may have limited this dead time and moved the story along more fluidly. It does beg the question of how faithful a film needs to be, of its stage musical roots?However the years have failed to dim the brightness of Cukor's achievement in creating a lasting Hollywood technicolor spectacle of irresistible music and song with a lightly satirical sub-text at English upper class expense. Without doubt, one of the great movie musicals!",My Fair Lady
90,jem132,I really wanted to like this film,6,28 April 2006,"'My Fair Lady' is a musical re-working of Bernard Shaw's play 'Pygmalion'. Starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, and with direction by George Cukor, it was always going to be a big hit, but I for one do not consider this up there with the best musicals of all time.For one thing, it is much too long. The run time is close to three hours, and the exuberance and spontaneity of musicals always seem to wear off after the two hour mark. The production values are magnificent though, the songs are superb and it is entertaining enough to watch for 170 minutes. A family favourite because it really is a 'nice' film, it also sadly misses the point of Shaw's original play. Shaw's aim was to show the class divide in England through the placement of the Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn), in upper-class English society, a territory she is unfamiliar with. Through Henry Higgins' (Harrison) bet that he can make a lady out of a common wench, Eliza is plucked off the streets and transformed into an elegant 'lady'.I've always disliked the presentation of the poor in these things as gloriously happy, sing-song people who are ignorantly happy with their lot- exactly the way they are portrayed herethrough song and dance numbers.This also becomes less about class and wealth and more about romance,so that disappointed me too. It is a sharp script, yet there is hardly any truly biting social commentary.Hepburn's performance is alright to good, without being exceptional. She simply was too glamorous and upper-crust to play the Cockney girl, and her accent is quite bad. Her songs are dubbed in too, so she's not actually singing here, folks. Harrison looks old next to Hepburn but his performance is much better than hers, he won the Academy Award for it. It is notable that they don't actually lock lips in this one, but the romance is there. The costumes are terrific, and Hepburn starts to hit her stride reasonably well when she is back in her usual glamour clothes, but there is nothing approaching her best work here.Still, audiences continue to love this film, so it can't be really bad. Perhaps we all just love seeing an ugly duckling to beautiful swan (though how Hepburn can ever be perceived as ugly is beyond me)transformation, it satisfies the romantic in all of us.6/10.",My Fair Lady

92,barryrd,Henry Higgins meets his match,8,23 August 2020,"My Fair Lady, the musical from 1964, directed by George Cukor, is a remake of the movie Pygmalion from 1938 with Wendy Hiller and Lesley Howard. Based on the George Bernard Shaw play, this musical extravaganza deals primarily with the relationship between Henry Higgins, a linguistics professor played by Rex Harrison, and Eliza Doolittle, a Covent Garden flower vendor, Audrey Hepburn. In taking charge of Eliza and teaching her how to speak ""proper English"" Henry shows an attitude of superiority towards the working classes whose ""cold blooded murder of the English tongue"" rule out any possibilities for social mobility. To make matters worse, he has no idea of how to properly court a woman, thus making him a confirmed bachelor. However, he meets his match in Eliza, who is no slouch when it comes to handling men.
The first half of the movie is too long and becomes a little tedious. After a social disaster at the annual Royal Ascot horse-racing event, the pace picks up and the viewer is in for quite a treat. The costumes, stage sets and dancing are delightful. The cast is excellent. Aside from Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, there are stalwarts such as Wilfrid Hyde-White as Colonel Pickering, Gladys Cooper as the mother, who doesn't hesitate to give her son a piece of her mind, Stanley Holloway as Eliza's much-loved father and Mona Washbourne as Higgins' efficient housekeeper. The role of Freddy, who falls deeply in love with Eliza, is performed by Jeremy Brett, who later on in his career, makes his mark as Sherlock Holmes.
This movie may seem dated but in the end is one well worth viewing and shows George Bernard Shaw's astute view of Edwardian England.",My Fair Lady

Fredericks With Marni Nixon (uncredited singer dubbing for Audrey Hepburn)...Director George Cukor, Screenplay and Lyrics By Alan Jay Lerner, Based On The play ""Pygmalion"" by George Bernard Shaw.""Just you wait Henry Higgins! Just you wait!""......The 60's was still a time when the Broadway musical ruled, both on stage and on the big screen. This flowery and ""flower power"" decade would still see such musicals on film as ""Westside Story"" ('61) ""The Sound Of Music"" ('65), ""Camelot"" ('67) and ""Oliver"" ('68). It came as no surprise that Warner Bros released ""My Fair Lady"", based on the old play ""Pygmalion"" by George Bernard Shaw. It was already the subject of a film from at least 30 years before and not to mention the biggest hit on Broadway at the time. It was Warner Brothers' most expensive film and producer Jack Warner's last great movie musical, as well as his prestige picture. The film was still in production when President John F. Kennedy was shot. The premise: A millionaire, well-educated language professor makes a bet that he can pass a street-walking flower peddler as an aristocratic and sophisticated lady. The original London cast had starred the legendary musical star Julie Andrews, for whom the role of Eliza Doolittle was written. But she was not star in the film version because director George Cukor, Warner Bros and Hollywood felt that Julie Andrews (who had only appeared in Mary Poppins by then) and had not yet finished filming ""The Sound of Music"", had no real star power to attract audiences. So they gave the role to none other than Audrey Hepburn. To be fair, the role should have gone to Julie Andrews, who would have been off to a great success on film with this role but Audrey Hepburn was still a very bankable star at this time and audiences flocked to see her films, especially after successfully different films like ""War And Peace"", ""A Nun's Story"", ""Green Mansions"" and ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"". But Warner Bros felt (wrongfully) that Julie Andrews was no real star and it would have made their movie into a flop if she had been cast. Hepburn's speaking parts (the singing voice belonged to Marni Nixon, who had dubbed for other stars in several musicals on film such as ""The King and I"" and ""Westside Story"") reveal her dramatic talent and her dedication to vividly portraying a Cockney flower girl, complete with the accent and dirty looks, who becomes her own woman after an education by the Professor, whom she loathes. As Liza she is terrific. Even now, no one can see another actress, not even the great Julie Andrews, as Liza in this film. It's interesting to note that, despite Marni Nixon She may be overdoing the Cockney accent and attitude, but her performance in the last part of the film is amazing, even Oscar-worthy. She has changed from street-bred, dirty and low-class flower seller to beautiful, elegant and sophisticated glamor girl. For Hepburn, such transformations on film were as easy to do as breathing, for she had already done the ""ugly duckling/swan"" bit in films that brought her success- ""Sabrina"" ('54) and ""Funny Face"" ('57). British star Rex Harrison as the rich, well-educated, sexist, pompous, imperious language professor Henry Higgins is superb. He wasn't much of a singer but the role didn't call for the flowery- lyric singing provided by Liza's character and he is mostly a ""talky"" kind of singer. The part was tailor-made for his type of acting. His chemistry with Hepburn is simply perfect. With Andrews, it would not have been the same (although some would disagree for both Harrison and Andrews were terrific on the stage) but there is no denying the chemistry between Harrison and Hepburn. Harrison oozes cynicism and a sort of old-fashioned masculinity which is well-matched with Hepburn's eventual resourcefulness, classiness, willful spirit and inner fire. When she finally wins his bet for him, she feels cheated, betrayed and hurt. Now, with her new-found education which itself brings the power to take life into her own hands, she lashes out on Professor Higgins and reveals she is no longer dependent on him or anyone. That moment in the end is Hepburn's greatest achievement on film. She had hoped to win her second Oscar but ironically lost to Julie Andrews (for her role as Mary Poppins) who proved to everyone, including Warner Bros who had snubbed her, that she was indeed star material. With Oscar winning cinematography by Harry Stradling and gorgeous as well as costly costumes by Cecil Beaton, this film is a winner. The memorable songs from this musical include: ""The Rain In Spain"", ""Would'nt It Be Lovely"" ""Just You Wait Henry Higgins"" ""Get Me To The Church"" and ""I Could Have Danced All night"". Interesting side not: Although Marni Nixon, trained operatically and on Broadway, sang most of the songs (because Hepburn's voice was small and not capable of reaching the high notes), Audrey Hepburn did in fact sing some portions of the songs, including ""Wouldnt It Be Lovely"" ""Just You Wait Henry Higgins"" and ""Show Me"".",My Fair Lady

STRANGELOVE and finally garnering a Best Director Oscar for the legendary George Cukor. For those who've been living under a rock since the 1960's, this is the story of a cockney flower girl named Eliza Doolittle who is transformed into a sophisticated lady through the art of learning how to speak properly by a phonetics professor named Henry Higgins. Rex Harrison won the Best Actor Oscar for recreating his Broadway role as Professor Higgins, the confirmed bachelor who allows his new creation to get under his skin. Eyebrows were raised in Hollywood when the role of Eliza Doolittle went to Audrey Hepburn, instead of the role's originator, Julie Andrews, who earned sweet revenge by winning the Best Actress Oscar the same year for MARY POPPINS. Hepburn is lovely as the transformed Eliza, but is less convincing as the dirty-faced cockney flower girl. Hepburn's singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon, who also sang for Natalie Wood in WEST SIDE STORY and for Deborah Kerr in THE KING & I. Wilfred Hyde-White and Gladys Cooper provide solid support as Higgins' friend who helps with the transformation and as Higgins' mother, who befriends Eliza when she really needs a friend. This movie is exquisitely mounted, with Oscar-winning production design and stunning, Oscar-winning costumes by Cecil Beaton. The original score to the musical comes to the screen almost completely intact, highlights being ""Wouldn't it be Loverly"", ""I've Grown Accustomed to her Face"", ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" and ""Just You Wait."" This is a textbook example of how to bring a Broadway musical to the screen. A joy from start to finish.",My Fair Lady
96,silverscreen888,"Opulent, Charming and Captivating; A Very-Intelligent Late Musical",8,22 July 2005,"This film is famous for the preceding history it boasted as a fine play and successful film ""Pygmalion"" written by perverse major-talent playwright George Bernard Shaw; for the opulent production accorded its production by MGM's executives; and for the controversy surrounding the handing of its female lead to Audrey Hepburn and not to its its Broadway leading lady Julie Andrews; for the strange choices made in awarding other roles to less-than-ideal choices; and for the lovely musical additions by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederic Loewe that are perhaps more celebrated by now than even the musical film itself--numbers such as """"Why Can't the English Teach Their Children How to Speak"", ""With a Little Bit o' Luck"", ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"", ""The Rain in Spain"", ""Let a Woman in Your Life"", ""On the Street Where You Love"", ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", ""Get Me to the Church On Time"" and The Ascot Gavotte"", Show Me"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed To Face"", among others. The story-line of the original play is retained; and it is relatively simple. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins encounters a colleague from India, Colonel Pickering who has come to see him, on a street outside a major theater. He criticizes a flower-girl's speech, remarking offhandedly that in six months he could her off as a lady--or a shop girl, which requires better English; that it is her accent which keeps her in lower-class poverty. The girl comes the next day, to his home where Higgins is entertaining his new guest, and offers to pay for training. Higgins is a social monster and frightens the girl with his rough talk, but he agrees to take her on, and sends her to his housekeeper to be given a bath and have her clothes burned and replaced--which act turns out to precipitate a major battle... At one point, her ne'er-do-well father, Alfred P. Doolittle, demands money to overlook the Professor's theft of his daughter, Eliza, meaning the income she had provided him; he uses the money to get married. The training proves difficult and arduous; Higgins' mother is amused and frightened by the experiment, set off by Pickering's wagering Higgins could not train the girl. But he does; Eliza proves to be bright, touchy, emotional and altogether more interesting than Higgins had expected. She succeeds, masters an upper-class accent; and then in rapid succession, she is presented at a party to social highbrows where her accent is perfect but the content of her speech is Cockney matters, which they take for a fashionable new court slang, and then she upsets the Ascot Race Meeting crying to the horse she has bet on, ""Move yer bloomin' arse!"", but charms Freddie Eynesford-Hill who becomes her shy suitor. At last the Professor presents her at a a royal ball where she charms everyone concerned, avoids any major faux pas, and convinces a bogus Hungarian phoneticist she must be royal herself. So the experiment has succeeded; Higgins has won his bet. Then he discovers, as a distraught Eliza confronts him the next day, that he has done what he had set out to do--he has created a person capable of self-assertion in the world, but not in the flawed British Empire's stratified and totalitarian society. She leaves him, to marry Freddy; and he discovers he has fallen in love with her. She recognizes that Freddy is unworthy of her and, despite the lack of promises and guarantees from Higgins, returns to do battle with him--for the rest of their lives, perhaps. The entire production looks unarguably lovely, even the Covent Garden faked scene, and a very difficult mixture of faked outdoor and elaborate indoor settings it must have been. Director George Cukor, famed for his skill with actors, gets a near-perfect job of acting from Rex Harrison as Higgins and quite a bit from Audrey Hepburn as Eliza. Others prominent in the large but briefly-seen cast include Theodore Bikel as the Hungarian hairy hound from Budapest, Mona Washbourne as the housekeeper, Isobel Elsom as Mrs Eynesford-Hill, Jeremy Brett as Freddy, Wilfrid Hyde-White as an acceptable Pickering, Stanley Holloway as Papa Dolittle, and Gladys Cooper adequate as Higgins' mother. The screenplay was by Alan Jay Lerner, and the cinematography by Harry Stradling, Sr. The production design and the lovely, colorful art direction must be credited to Cecil Beaton and to Gene Allen in both cases; Beaton also did the fabulously-expensive costumes with Michael Neuwirth. Despite its opulence, the film has consistent style, a very good flow of events and scarcely any look about it of sound-stage claustrophobia, re-hashed stage setting or extraneously-introduced musical numbers. This is a fine late musical achievement from the studio talents that produced of Hollywood's best US musicals, and the most beautiful to watch. It could have been cold and curiously overly-polished; instead it turned out to be a rather genial classic that is genuinely fun to watch in my view, and surprisingly more interesting than one had any right to expect it could be as an on-screen extravaganza.",My Fair Lady
97,anselmdaniel,A rousing and fun musical,8,24 November 2018,"This review contains spoilers.My Fair Lady is a musical film directed by George Cukor and stars Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn. The film is about a poor Cockney flower seller and a phonetics professor that seeks to improve the flower seller's accent and place in society. The movie follows these two characters throughout its 170 minute running time. Professor Henry Higgins, played by Rex Harrison, frequently coaches Eliza Doolittle, played by Audrey Hepburn.My Fair Lady is an incredibly lengthy movie at 170 minutes of running time. I did not feel the length as the movie was frequently entertaining with its musicals. The musicals and songs help drive the narrative with each song helping the audience understand where the two characters are at. The actual plot of this movie can be squashed into a 90 minute film. Thankfully this is not the case as the length of the movie actually aids in the enjoyment of it. This movie has many other good components besides the long musicals.Audrey Hepburn does a great job with her role of Eliza Doolittle. She starts off as a low-class woman that dreams of working a flower shop. She undergoes a transformation by the end of the movie by actually evolving into the character Henry Higgins wanted. This transformation was not total as Eliza still had her own ambitions. She has a great arc through the entire running time. Audrey Hepburn also does a good job portraying the character through the highs and lows.Rex Harrison as Professor Henry Higgins does a great job as the misanthropic professor. He too undergoes a character arc and by the end of the movie comes to an appreciation for Eliza Doolittle. The character and his mannerisms are well acted by Rex Harrison. I enjoyed this character even when it seemed he was being too cruel to Eliza Doolittle. Many of the scenes involving the two main leads are great to watch and enjoy.The supporting cast of this movie does a good job. I do not think there are any weaknesses in the casting choices. All of the characters do a good job in the musical scenes they are in or offer a nice moment with the main characters.The movie can drag for audiences that are not into musicals. This movie can feel excruciatingly slow if the audience does not like musicals. To audiences that are not interested in the musical aspects, they should still give this movie a chance.I highly recommend My Fair Lady.Grade: A",My Fair Lady
98,sashank_kini-1,A really good film,7,15 May 2009,"I just saw MFL yesterday and liked it a lot. The main reason why this movie shines is Rex Harrison who is brilliant as Professor Hendry Higgins, who is shown as a typical male chauvinist in the first but later understands his flaws.Rex understands his character very well and doesn't go astray from his character. He totally deserves the Academy Award and many other accolades. Audrey too was good and lovable, though she could have done a bit better towards the end. The other cast too is really good.The story itself is beautiful and well-written. The songs have a story to tell and thoughts and feelings to express. The main issue with the movie is the second part, especially towards the end. There is too much concentration on Eliza's father, who too does a fine job but his character had lesser importance. There were too many songs towards the end. The director could have put one or two more songs in the first half instead.And the story does drag on unfortunately.However, its still a wonderful film. 7 out of 10 for My Fair Lady.",My Fair Lady
99,Nozz,They waited too long to make it,6,30 December 1999,"By the time the film was made, the material was ossified.  There was none of the sparkle of newness to it, but there was none of the tension that comes with re-interpretation because who would dare change a thing?  So what came to the screen was orthodoxy, already stiff because the 1960s were not the 1950s.  It was around this time that Billy Wilder filmed Irma La Douce and simply left the musical numbers out because, for the time being, Hollywood was unable to make a musical in a suitably contemporary fashion.  But My Fair Lady got made because, well, not filming My Fair Lady would have been like not filming Gone With the Wind...",My Fair Lady
100,oOoBarracuda,"""Remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech.""",8,4 February 2016,"Can we bring back ""squashed cabbage leaf"" as an insult in 2016? It seems a lot nicer and more creative than the insults we have resorted to. My Fair Lady won Best Picture at the Academy Awards Ceremony honoring films from 1964. Considering the film was directed by George Cukor, and starring such notables as Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, it's no wonder that it won Oscar's top prize. Couple a stellar director with an all-star cast, with a great story told in a fun way through exceptional dialogue; My Fair Lady was a tough film to beat.Opening with what seemed like a 10-minute scene of a flower montage; which in Technicolor is enough to make an allergy sufferer sneeze, My Fair Lady then transitioned to show the extravagant elegance of aristocratic theatre goers. In a brilliant conversion, Cukor then goes to great lengths to show the desolate slums just miles away. It is in these slums that we meet our heroine, a poor flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn). When she ventures into the world of the elite to sell her flowers, Eliza happens upon a professor of linguistics, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison). Professor Higgins has ventured to meet another professional in his field, Colonel Hugh Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White). After observing Eliza's thick Cockney accent, Professor Higgins makes a bet with Colonel Pickering that he can take the disheveled girl and turn her into a proper lady. He not only bets that he can turn her into a proper lady, but that he can also pass her off as a fair lady, fooling the aristocrats as her final test. Colonel Pickering agrees to the terms and tags along to oversee and assist with the transformation. Eliza puts in hours per day of work on Professor Higgins's exercises in preparation for her final test. When that day comes, and Professor Higgins takes sole credit for the transformation of Eliza, she grows cross and disappears. Through her departure, Higgins realizes that he has grown quite used to her company, and even though he fancied himself an eternal bachelor, misses her feminine company. Will the man that swore off love give in to its power?Although I admit, that parts of the storyline was a bit predictable, it unfolded in a fun charming way that kept me watching. George Cukor shows why his films have stood the test of time through My Fair Lady. The juxtaposition of the elegance of the theatre to the slums was very well done. There was a beautiful hazy shot near the end of the film when Professor Higgins realized he was in love with Eliza. He also utilized freeze frames in an imaginative way in this film, which was a joy to watch. There was a dream sequence in which Eliza, envisioning herself hopefully as a proper lady, imagines herself meeting the King. This scene was playful and well-executed to show how simple of a background Eliza came from. Although I haven't seen all the films that were nominated for Best Picture from 1964, Cukor's directorial genius displayed in My Fair Lady would have been difficult to beat.My Fair Lady was only the second musical that I have seen, yet I would recommend it to fans of musicals, and musical novices (Like me) alike. The story was well-developed and fun, the characters were endearing and easy to root for, and the technical aspects were beautiful; all of these elements came together to bring an extraordinary film worthy of Oscar's top prize. This film is a must- see for fans of George Cukor. I'm already making a mental list of more of his films to see. Likewise, no fan of Audrey Hepburn should miss this film as she is stunning and enchanting in this role. Rex Harrison seems to be an underrated actor, for reasons I cannot comprehend, and I urge those who sink into his character in this film to search him out in others. My Fair Lady is also a great film that one can easily revisit, in comparison to many Oscar winning films that I call ""one watch onlys"". My Fair Lady has stood the test of time and remains a fun classic that I urge you to visit or revisit.",My Fair Lady
101,TaylorYee94,The most creepy musical film in the history,2,24 September 2020,"Every aspect of this film is obnoxious and disgusting. This is gaslighting story in which a grumpy, cranky old man keeps inculcating that Eliza's appearance is not noble, that her accent is low-class.Eliza Doolittle is portrayed repugnant as well. To make the story right, the only thing that changes after makeover is outside such as garment, accent, manner, and etc. Eliza's inside is the same, but people tend to judge based on outside. However, after Mr. Higgins' lessons, she becomes a totally different person. Audrey Hepburn's portrayal of Eliza is misleading and an eye-sore. Audrey Hepburn is only fit to have graceful and luxurious roles as you can see in the later of this movie.Music in musical film is so important, but 'My Fair Lady' fails to have any memorable and strong scores. Also, audience can obviously tell Audrey Hepburn does not sing, but it's dubbed. Choreography is non-existent and awkward if it has any. People stop during the choreography, making it so unnatural. Finally, this film is stretched without any obvious reason, this lengthy storytelling drags people out. Phonetic lesson scene is extremely long-winded that I could correct my pronunciation, too. Eliza's father's wedding scene is out of nowhere.",My Fair Lady
102,Lebowskidoo,Definitely a Classic,9,13 February 2017,"I bought this at a yard sale in 2013, kept putting it off thinking, ""Aacck! Look how long it is! Singing and wacky accents! I should call the dentist and see if he can bump up that root canal!"" I finally slapped it on...and I loved it! Rex Harrison's way of sing/talking, perfect! My favorite character: Colonel Pickering. Wilfred Hyde-White, that guy was great, a real scene stealer.Never before understood the allure of Audrey Hepburn...until now! Yeah, I'd seen Sabrina, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Wait Until Dark, all many years ago. Maybe too many years ago, now I have a greater appreciation of classic movies. She's absolutely adorable in this movie, and that one scene when she walks out dressed for the ball...jaw, meet floor! Surprised I knew half the songs already. But it has been around awhile, plenty of time to become an iconic musical. It was great, check it out if you can.",My Fair Lady
103,roghache,"Wonderful songs and costumes, a fair lady indeed and a deliciously insufferable tutor",10,1 December 2006,"I'm not an expert on the subject, having never read Shaw's play Pygmalion and being quite unfamiliar with any stage production of My Fair Lady. However, while I'm not normally a tremendous fan of musicals, I found this a wonderfully entertaining film adaptation.Of course this movie tells the tale of the English phonetics expert, Dr. Henry Higgins, who wagers with his colleague, Colonel Pickering, that he can transform the gritty Cockney flower seller, Eliza Doolittle, into a sophisticated lady simply by improving her diction, and pass her off as a Duchess at the upcoming Embassy Ball.Professor Higgins must be the most outrageous, most insufferable character ever to grace the silver screen, yet I loved this absurd champion of the Queen's English! Rex Harrison is so perfect, so hilariously entertaining in the role that I can imagine no one else filling it. I'd also sing the praises of Wilfrid Hyde-White as Higgins' kind, gentlemanly academic cohort, Colonel Pickering. Likewise, Stanley Holloway is brilliant as Eliza's ne'er do well father, that spirited scoundrel Alfred P. Doolittle.Regarding Eliza herself, there has been much controversy as to who should have been given the role, Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews, and I can thoroughly understand supporters of both these lovely ladies. Certainly Andrews had the voice and it has been argued, might have played the Cockney flower seller Eliza more convincingly. I feel that her career is one she can justifiably be proud of without having any regrets for missing out on the role she apparently captured so well on the stage. However, I found Hepburn perfect as Eliza and personally had no objections to her casting or any problem with the dubbing. I found her transformation from flower seller to elegant lady completely believable, her appearance stunning and demeanour impeccable at the Embassy Ball, her underlying intelligence, kindness, and wit frequently apparent, her original plight and later her unrecognized feelings for Higgins poignantly portrayed.The costumes are of course incredible, with the highlight surely being those atrocious, highly exaggerated hats at the Ascot races! In terms of the sets, I personally loved Professor Higgins' library with that spiral staircase! For me, the highlight of this film is the magnificent musical score by Lerner and Loewe. I like to leave the theatre after a musical humming one of its tunes, and there's barely a number in this one that didn't remain with me long afterward.In ""Wouldn't it be Loverly"", we glimpse the hardships of Eliza's life and her longing for the simple comforts and a good man to share them with, while ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", gives us an inkling of her burgeoning feelings for her woefully inconsiderate tutor. Where else in the musical world is there such a celebration of triumph as in the ridiculous ""The Rain in Spain""? And...sigh...the light seems to finally dawn upon our Professor in his musing ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"". However, perhaps my favourites are Alfred P's lively ""With A little Bit of Luck"" and ""Get Me to the Church on Time"", both perfect for singing in the shower!Perhaps My Fair Lady has its flaws as some claim, but I found it to be a stunning production and a timeless musical classic with unforgettable characters, gorgeous costuming, and incredibly catchy tunes. Of course there's also Audrey Hepburn, who was always such a radiant and gracious fair lady, whether on screen or off.",My Fair Lady
104,RiffRaffMcKinley,Gaaaarn!,10,12 September 2009,"A full appreciation of the greatness of this movie cannot be made succinctly. Too much went into making this film one of the five best musicals of all time, on both sides of the camera.Basically, ""My Fair Lady"" is the story of an unwashed, unrefined flower girl who becomes the object of a bet when boisterous, arrogant, sexist Professor Higgins bets he can turn her into a proper lady in time for a big high-society party. But it becomes much more than that: the girl, Eliza, knows that she's just an item for them to bet over, and her pleas for respect go completely ignored... until she finally puts her money where her newly refined mouth is and points herself out the door.Does Higgins really have feelings for her as a human being? Will the transformation be complete? Will there be songs all over the bloomin' place?On that last one, anyway, yes. In fact, the soundtrack to ""My Fair Lady"" is deservedly one of the most famous in musical history, and it's rendered impressively. The only problem is in the casting of Marni Nixon to sing for Audrey Hepburn as Eliza-- Nixon is a great vocalist, but it doesn't quite match. And Hepburn's vocals (available on either of the American DVD releases), while not stunning, per se, certainly would have worked for her big cockney solo songs.Six years after film critics made the comment that a real movie version of ""My Fair Lady"" was unnecessary due to ""Gigi,"" director George Cukor, and the entire crew, and the cast proved them wrong. If more movies were given this much thought, style, charisma, and elegance today, I'd probably go to the theater a lot more.Special praise must go to Hepburn, Rex Harrison, Gladys Cooper (who hilariously plays Higgins' mother), and Wilfrid Hyde-White, as well as Cecil Beaton (design), Andre Previn (musical direction), and Harry Stradling (cinematography).",My Fair Lady

The songs are playful and memorable, while the story is surprisingly emotionally complex.",My Fair Lady
106,dr_clarke_2,Hasn't aged well,5,29 June 2020,"George Cukor's much loved My Fair Lady ranks amongst the most popular of screen musicals. It's an adaptation of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's musical, itself based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, and in keeping with Shaw's original play it's a comedy of manners. However, it hasn't aged especially well.
Pygmalion worked - and still works - because it's inherently misanthropic, with its story of a pompous, sexist (and borderline misogynistic) professor of phonetics Henry Higgins who takes on the challenge of educating uneducated flower girl Eliza Doolittle as a pet project and does so in the most patronising and arrogant fashion possible. Higgins' triumph in the play is that he succeeds; Eliza's is that in the process she gains power over him and ultimately rejects him. It's often misremembered as a love-story, but it isn't. Neither is My Fair Lady, which sticks quite closely to Shaw's play but pitches it as a comedy. The result is now vaguely distasteful: in trying to play Pygmalion for laughs, Mr Fair Lady ends up with sexual politics that are dated to say the least; a struggling Eliza being forcibly stripped and bathed is clearly meant to be funny, but quite obviously wouldn't be if it actually happened on screen.
And yet there's a quite a lot that works here. The very fact that it isn't a love story - Higgins, eventually shamed by his mother for his appalling treatment of Eliza, realises that he has grown accustomed to her presence in his life and the pair end the film as friends - makes it strikingly and refreshingly unusual amongst popular Hollywood musicals. Audrey Hepburn is effortless endearing as Eliza Doolittle and adopts a convincing - if irritating - Cockney accent. Her transformation of Eliza over the course of the film is an impressive piece of acting and she's also hilarious when playing Eliza as a screeching street urchin during her first library scene with Higgins. Rex Harrison (reprising his original stage role) is perfectly cast as the eccentric, snobbish Higgins, and his scenes with Hepburn are a delight. Stanley Holloway provides comic relief as Alfred P. Doolittle and he does a great job when he's not singing.
The singing is part of the problem with My Fair Lady, although doubtless many would disagree. Harrison does a fine job of Higgins' songs, which are interesting in that they cast light on his low opinion of women, but few things in life are more irritating than people singing in Cockney accents and thus ""Wouldn't it Be Loverley?"" and ""With a Little Bit of Luck"" in particular form painful aural assaults. Another problem is that the English cast can't compensate for the fact that the film shows a romanticised American idea of London, as the exterior sets - which are obviously sets - and costumes make plain. Having said that, musicals are rarely aiming for realism, and the huge and lavish sets used for the interiors can't help but impress. Cukor, not exactly a veteran musical director, does a solid, polished job of the film, aided considerably by Harry Stradling's dynamic camera work, which fully exploits the expansiveness of the sets, particularly during the well choreographed ""Ascot Gavotte"" sequence.
But for all its gloss and spectacle however, My Fair Lady doesn't live up to its reputation. It still raises a chuckle at times, but for the most part the humour falls flat; viewed now, years after it was made, it's far too long and it shows its age in all the wrong ways.",My Fair Lady
107,happipuppi13,"""Speaking"" Of Singing : My Fair Lady",7,1 March 2007,"I already know I'm going to be in the minority here but this is my honest opinion of this film. The good points,Audrey Hepburn who was funny and appealing in her role,the storyline,the Marni Nixon vocals which Audrey lip-synched. Now,the rest!I watched this movie only because it won the Best Picture Oscar for 1964. I have seen all movies that have won best picture,including,""The Departed"". I can honestly say though,with the exception of the good things mentioned,I have never been so bored and even more annoyed at the same time! Nearly 3 hours to tell a story that could have been told in 2? Two men wagering about turning a cockney bag lady into a lady of manner & etiquette? 3 hours of listening to Rex Harrison and his male friend ""talk-sing""? He's more entertaining in ""Dr. Doolittle"". (In this case,I wish he had ""did little"". ) I had liked his acting in ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and wish he'd stuck to drama.I am not exaggerating when I say that by the end of this movie,I really had a headache! I have never had that happen watching a movie but that's only because other musicals I have watched may be long but have ""normal"" singing or they are simply 90 min. to 2 hours. Best Picture? Why? I really don't get that at all,when there were certainly more deserving films. I even like ""Gigi"" better than this overlong bombast! The only good songs....""The Rain In Spain"",""Wouldn't It Be Love-rly"",""With A Little Bit O'Luck"" and ""I'm Getting Married In the Morning"".I will never,ever sit through this movie again,once was more than enough! 3 stars,period! ---------- Edit 03/02/2010 : Well,looks like I'm eating my own words,that being that I'd never watch this again. A few days ago,I decided to give this another chance and to my surprise,I somehow enjoyed it better the second time around. All I can say is that the movie didn't seem as long as it had (maybe due to being on A DVD) and songs that had gotten on my nerves didn't. I still will say that ""talk-singing"" does get on my nerves a bit but not like last time. So with that,I'm changing my vote to 7 stars and also apologizing to fans of this film for blasting it a few years ago. It really is a fine film. ...but my best picture choice still,would have been Zorba The Greek for 1964. (END)",My Fair Lady
108,TheHonestCritic,"As far as movie musicals go, this is one of the best ones. But, how does it hold up today?",10,21 March 2021,"""My Fair Lady"" (1964), back in one of my high school English classes, our teacher told us that we were going to watch this movie. I just thought: ""oh, just another romantic chick-flick? This is going to be boring!"" But, when the teacher put it on, I found myself fully hooked right from the get go. I was shocked to find myself completely intrigued all the way from beginning to end! Here's a little backstory: on the first day we watched it, I was so invested that the dismissal bell caught me off-guard, because I was so focused on the movie and I didn't realize what time it was! Since our class periods were 50 minutes, it took about four classes in order to finish the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and most of my classmates loved it as well! Usually, most movies you watch in school or college suck. But, once in a while, you get a good one, or even a great one, and that's exactly what this film is. Before I wrote this review, I watched it again to refresh my mind with it. Still, to this day, it's such a phenomenal movie and it still retains a place on my top 10 all-time favorite movie musicals list! ""My Fair Lady"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a phenomenal soundtrack to tie it all together. Here's a little history about the story behind this film. ""My Fair Lady"" is based on a 1913 stage play, called ""Pygmalion"". It was eventually adapted into the 1956 famous stage musical and soon after that it was made into the film that we know today. The storyline is, a poor flower girl named Eliza Doolittle overhears a very stubborn phonetics teacher, named Professor Henry Higgins wagering that he can teach anyone, including her, how to speak proper English. Eliza has a strong Cockney accent, and she is taught how to speak with an upper-class English accent. Now, that sounds about as simple as you can get for a story. However, as I've said before, the simpler the plot, the better. With a simple story, it allows more room for character development and also a stronger investment from the audience with what's going on. I can tell you this, the plot is so much more than what you think. Plus, adding musical numbers to the mix really helps to keep it fresh and interesting all the way through. All of the songs are fantastic and add such an emotional layer to the story. The plot also keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Another thing, with such a strong, yet easy to follow plot, you find yourself caring more about the characters and wanting them to succeed in the end. I don't want to say anything else at the risk of spoiling anything. But, it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. As for the acting, it's nothing short of stellar from all the actors and actresses. Here's a little fun fact about the role of Eliza Doolittle. Julie Andrews, along with Rex Harrison who is in this movie, originally played the main characters in thousands of Broadway and London performances. When it was announced that a film adaptation of the musical was going to be made and Rex Harrison was cast to play Professor Henry Higgins, she wanted to play the part of Eliza for the movie adaptation. Since she knew the character and play inside out, she would've been the ideal choice. But, during that time, she wasn't that big of an actress yet. So, Audrey Hepburn was ultimately chosen to play Eliza Doolittle instead, while Juile Andrews went on to star in ""Mary Poppins"" (1964). I think Audrey Hepburn nailed the character, and did the film justice. Most of the movies that she stars in are incredible. She is a brilliant actress! The only thing, is that she was not a professional singer, like Julie Andrews. Her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Since Audrey Hepburn has serious acting chops, it's more than easy to overlook the dubbed singing. If you look online, you can find videos of musical numbers from the movie with Audrey Hepburn's actual singing voice. I honestly think she did a decent job with singing those songs, and her voice sounded every bit as good as Marni Nixon's dub. It would have been cool to see Julie Andrews play Eliza Doolittle in the film itself. But still, Audrey Hepburn did a phenomenal job with the character! The ironic thing is, Julie Andrews won the Best Actress award for her portrayal of Mary Poppins, while Audrey Hepburn was only nominated that year. Still, if Julie Andrews had played Eliza Doolittle, then we wouldn't have gotten her iconic performance of Mary Poppins! The rest of the cast is just as strong as the lead actors, and their chemistry on-screen is impeccable. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the movie a stunning atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Frederick Loewe is perfect and it definitely helps bring the film to life. What else can I say about the film score? Besides the fact that Frederick Loewe really knocked it out of the park! ""My Fair Lady"" is a masterpiece in the world of movie musicals. It may be nearly three hours in length, but I can promise that it's one of the fastest three hours you'll ever experience with any film! Is it my favorite musical? No, there are a few that I personally like better. But, I can still watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""My Fair Lady"", go and see it today! Now, I understand that this movie may not be for everyone. But, you should see it any way, because you just might be surprised.",My Fair Lady
109,mnpollio,"Beautiful looking, but stagnant adaptation",6,28 December 2010,"The now famous musical adaptation of Pygmalion with Rex Harrison as the arrogant elocution teacher Professor Henry Higgins who bets that he can turn Cockney flower seller Audrey Hepburn into a real lady and falls in love in the process. It is truly amazing to me the kind of unbridled affection that viewers and film historians have for this adaptation of the stage musical considering how devoid of passion the final result on screen is. Director George Cukor has crafted a technically lovely looking film, but the magic is muted and the enchantment of the stage hit is sorely wanting. Harrison was tapped to recreate his stage success, but filmmakers passed over Julie Andrews to gift the role of Eliza Dolittle to non-singer Audrey Hepburn (she is dubbed by Marni Nixon). Hepburn is truly lovely here, but she is no where near the immortal asset to the film that fans like to pretend. What is amazing about My Fair Lady - the screen version - is how much it makes one think fondly of OTHER screen musicals. Life is desperately needed here and on vastly short order. For instance, Stanley Holloway's purportedly show-stopping numbers as rendered on screen have a surprisingly MEH factor. When Eliza sings effervescently that she could have ""danced all night"" with Higgins, what she refers to on screen is a couple of clunky turns around Higgins' cramped study. Many of the numbers are deservedly familiar, but one walks away thinking they could have been staged much better than presented - particularly against the absurdly phony backgrounds. Harrison's stuffed shirt Higgins wears thin quickly. He is arrogant, preening and obnoxious, and it is virtually impossible to root for a romantic coupling between he and Eliza. The film's strong misogynistic streak may come from the source, but the screenplay here does nothing to soften it. Eliza raises a good point when she draws Higgins' attention to the fact that now that he has raised her consciousness and turned her into a lady - what can she do now? The fact that he considers her an ingrate and gets insulted says all we need to know about a pompous, vainglorious character that fails to evolve. It says a lot when the viewer actually hopes Eliza will take up teaching and marry young aristocrat Freddy, who actually adores her for herself, rather than settle for a life of servitude with Higgins. The film's final scene with Eliza puzzlingly returning to Higgins and him barking at her to get his slippers is decidedly disheartening. A classic that is nice to see once, but whose reputation has become too bloated to be believed.",My Fair Lady
110,hemisphere65-1,Astounding!,2,22 March 2021,"Not the movie, which is nearly unwatchable, but the glowing reviews.
I'm clearly missing something...
Higgins is nothing but a bitter old snob, and obviously gay. Even if Harrison was the actor that many pretend he was, the character is a wretch!
Pickering is the lover he never had.
Mr. Doolittle is a character that does not need to exist (what a waste of time in an already overly long movie).
Eliza could be a reasonable character, but Hepburn is about as convincing as Natalie Wood as Daisy Clover. Too old and phony.
The songs, for the most part, are terrible. I can not understand how this movie got all of the acclaim that has come it's way.",My Fair Lady

113,dimplet,"Audrey Hepburn is, and always will be, Eliza Doolittle",10,11 October 2011,"While I have the highest respect for Julie Andrews, I think the producers made the right choice in Audrey Hepburn. Andrews has the clear advantage of an extraordinarily fine voice, so she could have done her own singing, as she did in the London cast recording. But I have trouble seeing Andrews as the ideal for the Eliza Doolittle character over the full scope of the movie. What My Fair Lady is about is the story of Pygmalion, the play by George Bernard Shaw, but also the earlier Greek legend of the sculptor who created the image of his perfect woman out of stone, so beautiful that she came alive. So the end result must be a very high ideal of perfection, grace and beauty.Now Julie Andrews is no slouch in those departments, but she lacks the extraordinary other-worldliness that Audrey Hepburn was renown for. When Hepburn played a real princess in her first starring role in Roman Holiday, she was absolutely convincing. She made the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly in Sabrina. So when Eliza goes to the royal ball and everyone thinks the former flower girl is a princess going incognito, it is heartbreakingly believable. Eliza truly has been transformed into the ideal of perfection and beauty. As much as I admire Andrews, I can't quite imagine her being as convincing in that scene. Some say Andrews earned the part for her portrayal of the role on stage, and that she got a raw deal. If that had been the end of her career, I would be inclined to agree. But look at the wonderful, dream roles she has had since, particularly the immortal Sound of Music, in which she was perfectly cast. I think being miscast can be as bad or worse than no role at all. While Andrews certainly would not have been a disaster, I think she might have been a slight disappointment. There is a big difference between a portrayal on stage, in which the audience is more willing to suspend disbelief, and on film, where every pore is five feet tall. That is probably why the wonderful, but aging, Mary Martin didn't get many film roles. Andrews might not have been as convincing an Eliza on film as she was on stage.I see some posters calling My Fair Lady an American production. Just a reminder: Hepburn was not American. She was British-Dutch-Belgian. And while she came from a rich family, she grew up in starvation poverty while in Holland during World War II, which may have given her the depth to play such a range of roles, from the flower girl to princesses. I'm not saying Hepburn's portrayal of Eliza is perfect. I grew up with Hepburn as Eliza, and she inhabits the role, in my mind. But as an adult, with the closer examination of being able to watch the DVD version an infinite number of times, I do see some weaknesses in her portrayal. I doubt most people would see these in the first or second viewing. A more troubling question is whether Hepburn should have done her own singing. She had a good singing voice, and could have done a good job. You can hear her singing Moon River in Breakfast at Tiffany's. The ultimate reason they dubbed her may have been Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway. They are trying to make a musical, and most of the stars can't actually sing. To have a weak singing performance from Hepburn would have been too much. Marni Nixon could be counted on for a skilled voice match. (BTW, Nixon finally appears on screen in Sound of Music, as a nun commenting on Maria -- Andrews.) Problem solved.As to shortening some numbers, hey, this is a musical! The music is what it's about. I've seen too many musicals where they feel compelled to cut and cut to speed things up, shorten the movie. In South Pacific, the movie version cuts the ""Wash That Man Right Out of my Hair"" number down to one verse, and they really wrecked it. Brigadoon cut everything down to the minimum, and took all the wind out of the sails. With a musical, if you want to tell a story and have lots of music, you have got to make the film longer than the average non-musical; it's a big mistake to cut out parts of the story, or truncate the musical numbers. And as to the sets, the lesson I have derived from looking at many musicals is that you do not want a set that is too realistic. A musical is by nature a fantasy, because real people don't go breaking into song and dance in daily life. You need sets that are beautiful, but not entirely realistic. The 1962 remake of State Fair by Mel Ferrer, Hepburn's husband, was a disaster, and one reason was it was filmed very realistically. Guys and Dolls is perhaps the best example of non- realism, because the story was a fable, and the sets were almost like giant illustrations from a children's book. On the other hand, the movie version should not, generally, look too much like a Broadway play. Now, let's see, what would the My Fair Lady look like if the sets were a brutally realistic depiction of Edwardian London? We're talking real slums, with real horse manure. Save the realism for non-musicals.",My Fair Lady
114,Aly200,Good Film,7,30 July 2012,'My Fair Lady' originated on Broadway in 1957 and was a huge successful when released. This film adaption was released in 1964 without the original star in the female lead (Julie Andrews was to star in 'Mary Poppins' and that year won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal). But Audrey Hepburn shines in this film as the fiery-spirited cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon)opposite Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins (the role he originated on Broadway). The two actors are perfect foils for each other as the student and tutor who clash over the social graces that Eliza must learn in order to be a lady. This musical is quite underrated because of Hepburn's performance as opposed to Julie Andrews' in the original production. I think that it's a matter of interpretation; both actresses have their styles and play the character in her own way. This is one of Audrey's finest performance since her performance as Holly Golightly in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's',My Fair Lady
115,Bob Pr.,A GREAT musical,10,5 November 2010,"DVD runtime: 170 min. (Intermisssion about 2/3rds through). The film is a version of Lerner & Loewe's 1956 Broadway musical which, in turn, was a musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's 1916 play ""Pygmalion."" (Shaw's play loosely draws on Ovid's 1st century ""Metamorphoses"" for its plot.) Shaw was very active throughout his professional life in attacking the English class system (based very much on language & accent, as well as women's subservient role). ""MFL"" is in Ebert's list of ""Great Films."" Years ago, I bought the record album of ""MFL"" and the sequence of its music tells the rough outlines of the story: a financially secure, snobbish, completely non-empathic but gifted phonetics professor, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) makes a bet with a close friend, Col. Pickering, that within 6 months he can transform Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), a Cockney girl selling flowers, a ""gutter snipe,"" into a lady who'll be accepted by and in upper society by changing the way she speaks. The movie shows that next 6 months as Eliza learns ""proper"" (i.e., upper class) speech and manners. Harrison & Holloway (the latter plays Eliza's father) reprise their roles from the Broadway musical. Hepburn's Cockney accents seemed genuine; she lip synchs her songs to Marni Nixon's actual vocals. Roger Ebert's helpful review discusses in detail the huge uproar from the choice of Hepburn instead of Julie Andrews (who played Eliza's role on Broadway), the substitution of Nixon's singing voice, and the fate of lip synching after that (plus many other interesting things). This gorgeous, stunning film adds more verses and variations to the music than that on my album. Harrison and Hepburn are simply great in their roles, as are all other supporting players including a much younger Jeremy Brett (later an older Sherlock Holmes in the PBS series) as Eliza's young aristocratic suitor, Freddy, smitten with Eliza.All the sets are magnificent. My companion had seen stage versions of ""MFL"" twice before but never this film -- she found the film was much richer and more satisfying. I was roughly familiar with the story but surprised to learn some things I hadn't known from the songs on the album: e.g., that Prof. Higgins had a near disastrous practice run with Eliza at the Ascot races and that something unwanted happened to Eliza's father that elevated him into the middle class.My rating is 10 of 10 stars. My only minor criticism is that I thought both of the Doolittle (Holloway) singing and dancing numbers, ""With a Little Bit 'o Luck"" & ""Get Me to the Church on Time,"" went on a little too long (half would've been sufficient for me). The film nicely leaves one in doubt as to whether Eliza will go back to and stay with Higgins or marry Freddy--although maybe with a slight bias to returning to Higgins? In case you wonder what happens to Eliza in GBS's ""Pygmalion"" you can read Shaw's own long description of their later lives (see 'Sequel: What Happened Afterwards') following Act V (for the link, google: bartleby: Shaw, Bernard 1916 Pygmalion). And, in that same link, if you also read the 'Preface: A Professor of Phonetics,' you'll find that Shaw somewhat modeled Higgins' personality and interactions after an actual professor of phonetics, Henry Sweet, who was gifted but quite prickly --and/or, read the entire delightful ""Pygmalion"" play.",My Fair Lady
116,Catharina_Sweden,A treasure for all times,10,25 June 2014,"This is an excellent musical and movie! A treasure for mankind for all times, I think. It has everything: wonderful music, singing and dancing, excitement, romance, erudition, interesting characters, humour, first-class actors... It is also a perfect period drama with wonderful clothes, interior decoration, etc..Rex Harrison is just right as Professor Higgins, whom he plays about the same as he played Julius Caesar i Cleopatra. A strong, intelligent, ruthless, egoistic and a bit grumpy character... but in some strange way attractive to women anyway! (Harrison was entirely wrong for Doctor Doolittle, though, because the veterinarian should be quite another sort of person - nice and kind, benevolent and a little naive.) When I learned English, I used to practise by listening to audio books and plays read by the best British actors, and trying to ""shadow"" their voices... I wish I could have had private lessons from Professor Higgins instead! :-) ...and Audrey Hepburn was just right for Eliza. Julie Andrews would not have been right at all, because - although she was very nice-looking and likable and had a good voice for musical and everything - she did not have the ethereal beauty, regal bearing and inborn aristocracy that was necessary for the role. Elizabeth Taylor, who was also mentioned as a possible choice at the time, would have been better than Andrews but she would not have done either - because even if she had beauty and style, she was too full-figured and oozing too much sex appeal...As for the controversial ending; normally I hate when movie-makers change things, and especially endings, from plays, novels, or original movies. But in this case, it would have been much too sad if Eliza and Higgins had not come together in the end. She was in love with him, after all! It was the only possible ending, and I think it made the movie very romantic!",My Fair Lady
117,antagonist117,"Hit after hit, with superlative acting and staging",10,17 June 2013,"Every song in this musical is a hit. Rex Harrison is at his Rex Harrisoniest, erudite but brilliantly insufferable, and Audrey Hepburn reveals layer after layer of Eliza Doolittle. The costumes are gorgeous, particularly in the artfully-staged, hilarious scene at the racetrack. Stanley Holloway, who played Eliza's ne'er-do-well father on Broadway before bringing the role to the screen, steals his scenes. This movie earned every bit of its Best Picture Oscar and remains one of the best movie musicals of all time. The movie is not just candy, it does not dodge the philosophical class and gender implications of its story, but it refuses to be mean-spirited and, impressively, does not yet run too much afoul of modern sensibilities. If anything can be taken away from it it is its departure from George Bernard Shaw's preferred ending, but it was hardly the first production of ""Pygmalion"" to choose what was for many decades a more crowd-pleasing conclusion.",My Fair Lady
118,stills-6,It's Rex Harrison's Show,8,23 June 2000,"Best cinematography?!?!? Best director??!?!? Best picture?!?!!? It's good, but it's not that good. The two leads make the movie as good as it is. Rex Harrison makes this role his - like Tim Curry's Frank N Furter, there's no one else you can picture playing this part. Audrey Hepburn has a harder time, Cukor should have spent more time with her about her character's third-dimension (""you're supposed to be in love with this guy""). But she has a great screen presence and an intensity that you can't look away from.I think the musical steals more from The Taming of the Shrew than Pygmalion. It might have been a better idea to have gone in that direction more overtly for this film. The romances - all of them - are completely unbelieveable, except for the one between Higgins and himself.The main problem I have with this musical is that the show-stopping numbers from the supporting cast don't work at all. Harrison is a show-stopper in himself, rendering anything outside his storyline irrelevant and a waste of time. In fact, most of the numbers he is not a part of are a mistake. The ""Loverly"" number was given a thoroughly unoriginal and plodding treatment, Jeremy Brett's Freddy is an insipid milquetoast, and any number that Stanley Holloway is a part of is just something to be endured.",My Fair Lady
119,frankwiener,But What Had Henry Learned?,7,20 September 2017,"Watching Audrey Hepburn play Eliza Doolittle while Marni Nixon sings some wonderful Lerner and Loewe songs is the best of both worlds. Having undergone extensive voice training for the role, when she learned that all of her songs would be dubbed by Ms. Nixon, Audrey walked off the set in a state of bitter disappointment but humbly apologized to the cast on the next day. Class act, Audrey. Even in the worst of circumstances, she never failed to live up to our idealized image of her.While Rex Harrison ""talked"" his songs, often as he deliberated his feelings and impressions, and while Ms. Nixon so pleasingly intoned Hepburn's songs, the one member of the cast who actually sang his songs was Stanley Holloway, who replayed his original Broadway role as Alfred P. Doolittle, Eliza's father. Holloway was born for the role. Sporting a dustman's cap with great authenticity and then donning an elegant tuxedo for his own wedding, he stole the show with his two iconic musical numbers. Unforgettable!Unfortunately, not all of the songs in the show were as impressive as Holloway's, and, for me, a musical is only as good as its music, especially when it is brought to film. A few of the lesser tunes could have been eliminated without losing the gist of the story. The film also ran much too long with dialogue that seemed to repeat itself and actually became tiring. Eliza felt used and abused while Professor Higgins was slowly falling in love with her. Got it! No need to hammer these situations into our heads more than necessary.I also had trouble with the ending. While Harrison perfectly performs ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"", again in that special, introspective manner, and suddenly realizes how emotionally attached he had become to Eliza, what was the message of the final scene? That Henry was still the same arrogant egotist that he had always been? Shouldn't the movie have ended with a much more confident Eliza assertively instructing him to get his own bloomin' slippers? To the very end, Henry and Eliza never enter into a physical relationship, and I suppose that was consistent with Shaw's original play, upon which this musical was based. I can somehow accept that, but what had Henry learned during the past two hours and fifty minutes of film time? Apparently, not much. He was the same pompous ass at the end that he was at the beginning.",My Fair Lady
120,adventure-21903,A Great Oscar Winning Film starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison Warner Bros,10,17 November 2019,"Jack Warner bought the movie rights to this hit musical for $5 million. A lot of money today but an astronomical amount of money in the early 60s. Cary Grant was Warner's first choice to play Henry Higgins and wanted James Cagney to come out of retirement to play Eliza's father. The leading lady role was offered to Audrey Hepburn because of her worldwide box office appeal and because quite frankly I think she was perfect for. It is shocking the way Audrey Hepburn has been treated for starring in this movie. Julie Andrews did not have any movie experience and with Cary Grant and James Cagney passing on the movie Warner Bros. Needed a great star in Hepburn as insurance. The sets are magnificent the costumes are magical the music is legendary and all of this was done at the Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank.

They are all characters we love, and will always love. The performances are wonderful, particularly Audrey Herpburns. She gives what is very possibly her best performance.

Hijinks, personal conflicts, and romance ensues as Eliza struggles to prove herself to be more than just a ""gutter-snipe"", and Higgins is forced to face the fact that he may not be the end-all be-all of planet Earth.""My Fair Lady"" is such a beautiful film to watch, with an extremely interesting story (based, of course, on Shaw's ""Pygmalion""), a fine cast, and beautiful art direction and cinematography. And yet. . . it's a musical. That's my number one problem with the whole thing. I don't necessarily have anything against musicals, though I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but one still can't help feeling that a straight adaptation of this material would have been better.The song score is made up of classic songs - classic, in that they were/are very popular and have been done and re-done hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Yeah, excuse my cynicism, but it's hard for me to consider them truly classic when I can barely remember them an hour after the movie is over. There are some nice songs, namely ""Show Me"", ""Why Can't the English"", and my favorite, ""Just You Wait, Henry Higgins"", that are highly memorable, but most of the show's other major songs are fairly typical Broadway show tunes. There's also the issue that some of the song's are superfluous and/or overlong. ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" is a nice little song that goes on for about two minutes too long.And then there's the subplot involving Eliza's father Alfred (Stanley Holloway), who goes from a money-grubbing, womanizing, lazy bum to a rich lecturer (thanks in large part to a practical joke by Higgins) - a sort of counterpart to Eliza's transformation into an affluent society girl. Holloway is great in the role, and his character is amusing, but his two songs - ""A Little Bit of Luck"" and ""I'm Getting Married in the Morning"" - go on way too long and add little to the story.Another problem I have with the film is the ending, which I'll not spoil, but I don't think it's really true to the characters or the way the story develops.My problems with the songs aside, ""My Fair Lady"" is such a gorgeous film that one is reluctant to criticize it. The sets are wonderfully authentic, capturing Edwardian England perfectly; the costumes are some of the most gorgeous ever put on film, and George Cukor's direction is nothing short of brilliant. Most of the characters are very well-drawn and believable. Audrey Hepburn makes an unbelievably lovely Eliza; she is convincing both as the foul-mouthed flower girl and the polished débutante who wants to find true love and recognition. This is perhaps her signature role (despite her songs being dubbed), and it's easy to see why. Rex Harrison nails the part of Higgins perfectly, though to be fair, he had a lot of practice on Broadway. Wilfred Hyde-White and Stanley Holloway also create memorable characters.But for me, the regrettable banality of the film's songs will prevent me from claiming it a masterpiece. I will always wonder if ""My Fair Lady"" had been a straight adaptation of ""Pygmalion"", with the same cast - I've no doubt that would have been a masterpiece. But much as I love aspects of it, I cannot call ""My Fair Lady"" a truly great film.7/10.",My Fair Lady
124,lyubitelfilmov,"Flower girl in ""high society"" or How one bet changed a whole life",10,14 February 2021,"Musical. A screen adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name by Frederick Lowe, in turn based on the play ""Pygmalion"" by the famous writer and playwright of British-Irish descent Bernard Shaw. I have nothing to say about the play and the musical, since I have not read the first and have not watched the second, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work, following the spirit of the original sources. Shine! Fantasy! A miracle of wonders and a guarantee of a good mood for a few days, maybe even weeks. No, I'm not crazy, it's all true. And here's my brief opinion - Creep in ""high society"". There are no shortcomings in this masterpiece, but there are some remarks, which I will mention in a separate paragraph, but for now, allow your humble servant to focus your attention on the expressive merits of this masterpiece musical.
So, here they are:
1. The story told - the beginning of the twentieth century. London. Two wealthy gentlemen decide to make a bet. They have to make a real high society lady out of a street seller of flowers in six months, and none of the ""high society"" should suspect deception. The poor flower girl is given a unique chance to drastically change her own life and transform herself literally before our eyes. I have no right to disclose the details and turns of the script, because I do not want to spoil the viewing for those who have not yet deigned to evaluate this masterpiece. I will just say that everything will be here: romance, humor, songs (many songs, a lot of songs), great acting, amazing music and an expressive ending that will not leave you indifferent to everything that happens!
2. Audrey Hepburn - how could you impress me even more than in ""Breakfast and Tiffany"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""How to Steal a Million"", ""Stories of a Nun"", and indeed in any picture? Amazing talent and mastery of transformation. Play a street grubby, rude and hysterical and soon reincarnate as a refined lady. A delicate flower that should be cared for and cherished, but not in any way subjected to such humiliations that will be here. I am sure that many of the scenes were purely Audrey's improvisation, since this is simply impossible to predict. I have no exact information about this, but an inner voice tells me that it is. And who am I to argue with that.
3. Humor - in many places I laughed heartily, and sometimes it was not even laughter, but hysterical laughter that was impossible to stop. Witty, ironic, funny and guarantees the production of endorphins in your body. There are many funny situations that will make you smile and brighten up hard working days.
4. Songs are a musical, especially of the mid-twentieth century, so there are many songs, but here there are even more. I can't say I liked all of them, but most were good, especially Audrey's evil song in the first third of the picture. The rest fit perfectly into the light (and sometimes not so) mood of the picture. I also liked a few songs of the minor characters.
5. Music - it is taken from the musical of the same name, therefore it perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the next variation of ""Cinderella"". The music is light, beautiful and catchy, especially the title theme.
6. Scenery and Costumes - London was not real, and only the studio scenery played its role, and it shows. But competent placement, surroundings and little things convince the viewer that this is London from the beginning to the very end. The costumes are perfect, especially for the beautiful Audrey! And how they suit her, especially a hat with flowers! Unforgettably!
7. Charismatic heroes - both first and second plan. They are all perfectly written and remembered. Yes, there are pure caricatures, but there are also banal ones, but this does not interfere with the perception of everything that happens. Each has its own character, with strengths and weaknesses that are obvious.
8. Romance - it runs through the whole picture like a thin thread and in the final is revealed in all its glory. Two so dissimilar people who are drawn to each other, but one of them does not admit this to the last, although the heart and soul by this moment are already screaming with love. All romance develops logically, and is not taken out of thin air, as in most modern paintings, where it must always be present.
A little about the main characters:
1. Eliza Doolittle performed by Audrey Hepburn is a street flower girl, rude in her tongue, who turns from a grubby into a real lady with an ideal voice and manners, striking everyone on the spot with her dazzling beauty. Audrey's talent breathed a second life into Eliza and made both of them famous for years to come. Bravo Audrey! Bravo and a whole pen!
2. Henry Higgins performed by Rex Harrison is a professor of literature and a staunch bachelor who, out of scientific interest, made an interesting bet with a friend. Still not suspecting that this will drastically turn not only his life, but also everyone around him. I remember Rex from the magnificent role of Caesar from the masterpiece of historical cinema ""Cleopatra"" in 1963, but here he played a brave and self-confident aristocrat with a scientific vein, completely devoid of romance (as he thought). Bravo Rex! Bravo!
In several places, the picture was able to knock a tear out of me, especially at the moment when the heroine realized that there would be no return to the past.
Regarding comments. It would not hurt to shorten the picture, for about twenty minutes so precisely, since some of the scenes are already too stretched. You can safely cut out a few songs that do not carry a new semantic load. Since this way the picture looks protracted, and at some moments even boring.
Why was this masterpiece released only on DVD in Russia? I demand to publish it in blu-ray format with a restored picture, with Russian subtitles for songs and additional materials that will allow you to look at the other side of the camera. And the new generation of viewers does not bother to get acquainted with this classic of world cinema, which, among other things, received eight Oscar awards, and each one is absolutely deserved!
Despite the above remarks, I cannot change the final grade and put it below tens, forgive me. I'm in love!
Well Audrey! I also looked at three pictures with your participation, and I liked all of them. But I haven't watched ""Sabrina"" yet and a few other works that praise you. I will definitely fill this gap. Kiss and love!
As a result, we have a masterpiece musical based on the classics of world literature, with an excellent script, great humor, exciting songs, great romance and great acting, including Rex Harrison and incomparable Audrey Hepburn!

126,vox-sane,My Fair Movie,10,25 October 2004,"Very few movies are letter-perfect. Not perfect in the sense that goofs and gaffes don't exist here and there, but perfect as in pure entertainment. Especially in long movies, the squirm element is always a threat. ""My Fair Lady"", bringing the most tuneful of Broadway scores to the big screen (really big, at the time) was as perfect as movie entertainment could be. The old furors over Audrey Hepburn seem silly in hindsight. Hepburn replaced Julie Andrews, a wonderful singer-actress who had created the role, not only on Broadway but in London. But Andrews was not a familiar face to movie-goers and no one knew if she'd hold an audience in the movies as in the live theaters. Too, Hepburn was an inspired choice, since her background probably would make Eliza Doolittle's transformation from flower-selling gutter-snipe into a lady of quality more believable (Hepburn's mother was a baroness). As far as her singing voice, the new DVDs of ""MFL"" have her acting to her own recordings of a few of the songs, and while it's not bad, at this level of film-making expense and prestige, ""not bad"" is no good.Surrounding her are a magnificent cast. Stage and screen pros Rex Harrison (Henry Higgins) and Stanley Holloway (Doolittle) were carried over from Broadway (after some initial and rather foolish questions about both). Joining them were veteran droll actor Wilfred Hyde-White as Col. Pickering and an amazingly youthful Jeremy Brett (""Sherlock Holmes"") as Freddy.The book and lyrics were by Alan Jay Lerner and the music by Frederick Loewe (""Brigadoon"", ""Camelot"", ""Gigi"", etc.) based on George B. Shaw's best play. A fully ""integrated"" musical where the songs advance the story or reveal character, the nonpareil line-up of songs include ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"", ""The Rain in Spain"", ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" and ""On the Street Where You Live"".Because of its theatrical origins there is an unavoidable stage-bound look to some scenes. But the designers have done their best to keep this from being a detriment. The interiors look like real houses, the Covent Garden set is a masterpiece of openness. Only the Ascot scene retains its staginess, but its black and white palate and stylized look adds variety to the movie.The restored DVD version looks great. I saw a print of this movie in a revival theater in the early 1980s; it was blurry and broken and the colors were faded and inaccurate. Yet the designers used a rich tapestry of colors and wood tones, giving every corner of the movie's wide screen something worth seeing. ""MFL"" was a spectacle well worth the struggle and expense of restoration. Everything about ""MFL"" was first-class, the cast, script, costuming, sets, music. For someone who enjoys musical there's not a dull moment.",My Fair Lady
127,standardmetal,MFL: the DVD,9,9 August 2003,"I think people are being rather churlish about Audrey because they still resent Julie not getting the part. But this was around 40 years ago so can we forgive and forget? Particularly since Julie, in an obvious sympathy vote got the Academy Award that year (for Mary Poppins) and Audrey wasn't even nominated. Yes, Audrey was dubbed and Marni Nixon (the dubber) on the DVD speaks at great lengths about how it was done. Also included on the DVD are Audrey's actual vocals of ""Loverly"" and ""Show Me"". While she wasn't bad in the first, the second was somewhat beyond her vocal ability.In fact, it seems that Audrey might have originated the role on Broadway were it not for a false rumor that she was pregnant at the time. Incidentally, John Gielgud remarked, in one of his letters, that he thought Audrey was better than Julie!I thought the film was excellent, dubbing or not, and the casting was also excellent. I had two small reservations about the film: The first was the fantasy scene where Audrey-Marni sang ""Just you wite, 'enry 'iggins"" which Cukor hated and with good reason. It should have been done without the oil on the lens and probably without the ""enactment"". The other was the race at Ascot where the horses were shown briefly twice and perhaps the turning binoculars would have been sufficient and funnier as on the stage.But I suppose they didn't want to appear ""cheap"".The ending was, I think, pretty close to the film of Pygmalion and the musical was based on the film and not the play (in which I think Eliza marries Freddie.) I do think there's a certain amount of ambiguity in this ending and I don't think Shaw's estate would have allowed much else. G.B.S. himself would not have accepted Eliza marrying Henry and he said as much.According to the DVD, Cecil Beaton, who did actually design the stage sets, did virtually nothing on the movie except take the credit and a terrific still of Audrey in costume according to the commentary. In effect, the DVD plays the film over while 4 people (Gene Allen the art director of the original film and Cukor's assistant, the restorers Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and the aforementioned Miss Nixon.) comment on each scene and I think that's overkill but one doesn't have to watch it. As for me, I could have done with less on the restoration but enjoyed the comments on the actual shooting of the movie especially on Audrey, Rex and the various other players and extras.9 for the film and DVD.",My Fair Lady
128,michael_the_nermal,Lovely Songs and Great Acting Make for a Great Musical,8,13 June 2006,"If you are the sort who despises musicals, the stop reading right now and turn around. This movie is a deserved classic, with a smoothly-flowing story and perfect acting. I enjoyed this film much more than ""Mary Poppins,"" and felt that Ms. Hepburn deserved the Oscar for her portrayal of the gutsy, proud Cockney flower girl Eliza. Rex Harrison is great as the stuffy, equally-proud linguist Henry Higgins. This movie remains faithful to George Bernard Shaw's satiric vision, where class can be denoted through simple language and dialect. Higgins is a wonderful caricature of the stodgy upper class, who looks with contempt on those below him, and fails to regard the feelings of those people, like Eliza. Eliza is less a caricature (again, not being English, I know little of the stereotypes of the cockneys), and her transformation in the film is credible, in spite of the ""refinement"" of her dialect. The songs are all classic, and you may find yourself singing along with the tunes. Audrey Hepburn, well into her thirties, is gorgeous and stunning to behold: a great actress and a genuine Hollywood beauty. This film represents the last golden era of cinema musicals, and is well worth your time.",My Fair Lady
129,mgruebel,Pygmalion 1964,8,30 December 2018,"Based on the play by Shaw, this really is a gem of film-making from the 1960s musical era. It's hard to go wrong with Rex Harrison and above all the divine Audrey Hepburn.In this ignorance-to-education story, a diamond in the rough is taken from gutter snipe to lady, mainly by teaching language. The conceit is that you are what you talk like.The tension arises because dear Mr. 'Enry 'Iggins, a self-declared language expert and Eliza's teacher and foil, is really a pretty nasty character: sexist, rough-mannered, although he thinks of himself as the epitome of humanity. His best excuse is that ""he does it to everyone equally."" Not quite true, he treats his male friend Hyde-White certainly better than his housekeeper or poor Eliza.The film features awesome songs (maybe one out of a dozen or so is meh, the rest are among the best Broadway has ever seen), amazing costumes, and a caterpillar-to-butterfly transformation of Audrey Hepburn's character that leaves the viewer spellbound the whole time. The side characters, like the puffed-up Hungarian count who seeks to demask Eliza, Higgins' mother, who knows what an ornery fellow her son is, Eliza's dad, an intelligent but downtrodden free spirit, are all nicely drawn.Modern audiences will find Higgins a bit grating - he remains unrepentant and a sexist pig to the last - but hey, times were not as politically correct in the early 20th century, when Britain was still lording it over India and suffragettes were marching through the streets demanding the women's vote. The movie is an interesting stylized vignette of turn-of-the-century British society both low and high, as conceived by George Bernard Shaw and viewed through the lens of the 60s, and the cinematography, music, acting, singing and the hats, oh the hats, are all amazing.",My Fair Lady
130,budmassey,The quintessential musical with a staggering pedigree.,10,10 September 2003,"The classic case of an embarrassment of riches.  The infrastructure of this jewel reads like a Who's Who of American Cinema. Take the play by George Bernard Shaw.  It's in the Western Canon of Literature, for heaven's sake.  Then add lyrics by Jay Lerner and his longtime collaborator composer Frederick Loewe who gave us everything from An American in Paris, to Gigi, to Brigadoon, among many others. 
Directed by George Cuckor, whose credits include not only Gone With the Wind, but also a string of Katherine Hepburn films, My Fair Lady bears Cuckor's brilliant touch in directing leading women.  And what a leading woman he had to work with this time.  Audrey is breathtaking in every move and every syllable she utters.  But that's not all.  Those stunning costumes designed by Cecil Beaton are without peer in modern cinema, especially the Ball Gown.  Audrey was so exquisite that she looked unreal, perhaps of another species, as she descended the stairs and donned her velvet cape.With music direction by Andre Previn, the baton behind Gigi, Porgy and Bess, Kiss Me Kate and even Jesus Christ Superstar, My Fair Lady's musical pedigree is complete. From this perspective, My Fair Lady is the culmination of a generation of America musicals, and the greatest one of them all even before the first frame was filmed.Ironically, Audrey was denied a well-deserved Oscar.  She didn't even get nominated, which from an historical perspective boggles the mind.  The Oscar that year went to Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins.  Andrews, who had popularized the role of Eliza Doolittle on Broadway before the movie was made, passed on My Fair Lady to do Mary Poppins.  Andrews, a gifted singer, was reportedly miffed at the casting of Hepburn, whose singing was dubbed by an uncredited Marne Nixon, and Hepburn's exuberant performance was completely ignored by the SAG.But there were enough Oscars to go around.  Beaton, Harrison and Previn all collected statuettes, and My Fair Lady collected eight total and was nominated for four more.  This immense achievement was almost lost to deterioration, but the newly restored version is stunning.  If you don't have this one in your collection, you can't call it a collection.",My Fair Lady
131,arthera09,I don't care if my friend make fun of me but I love this movie,9,18 March 2007,"This is one of the best if not the best musical out there. Rex Harrison did was perfect and Audrey Hepburn could not have been funnier. There are very few times when I actually stop by to admire the costumes, but the costumes are one of my favorite parts of the movie and in a way really move the story forward and gives us endless character development. The race track scene is one of my favorite scenes of all time and everything about it is perfect. The costumes of course (I love how Rex Harrison's suit stands out in an almost garish way), and the lighting and choreography of the scene. There are very few times when I actually think that the placements of the extras was perfect, but it was in this scene. I could talk about this scene all day, but I will move on. The songs are surprisingly catchy and not over the top (like Hello Dolly). I liked how the dance numbers involved people that could not really dance and really looked like people off the street. The last thing I want to point out is one of standout moments of the movie is when the street is just getting going in the morning and the extras freeze in waves and then start moving. I love that scene and regard it as one of the more original scenes in any movie I have seen. The end was also nice because unlike more ""romantic comedies"" did not have the big mushy moment at the end but ended with grace with a very personal moment shared by two people that loved each other.",My Fair Lady
132,ohlabtechguy,"Lots of catchy songs, but short on substance!",7,14 February 2007,"Just saw the 3 hour 1964 version of this movie on VHS. First impression was Audrey looked too clean and her teeth too good to be a desperate little flower peddler on the streets of old London. The movie was colorful, but the studio sets were too obvious, especially the horse race scenes. The movie was overly long and many of the musical numbers were neither compelling to watch nor advancing of storyline. The relationship between Eliza and Professor Higgins was odd and nearly nonsensical. He was obviously too old to be a serious romantic contender, yet there was some underlying and unresolved emotional attraction between the two that was not adequately explained. Therefore, the ending scene where Eliza has come back is unsatisfying and confusing. Is she to become Mr. Higgins maid, mistress, or live-in pet? It's not clear and none of these possibilities seems very plausible.Cut some of the lesser songs and scenes that don't advance the plot. Concentrate more on the dramatic metamorphoses of a low class peasant girl into a radiant princess and explore the psychological effects they have on her. I dunno....this movie didn't work for me. If not for the on screen appeal of Audrey, I could not have watched this movie.""On the Street Where You Live"" is one of my all time favorite musical songs. Loved Vic Damone's version. But watching the scenes in the movie that included this song proved disappointing. The actor singing the song was shot long, full view in shadowy street sets. Therefore, no facial emotion was seen to go along with the full bodied emotions characteristic of the song.",My Fair Lady

And it seems she has a fair to good chance of seeing them satisfied.That of course is before Henry Higgins takes her under his wing. (...no, that's not the right metaphor. How about, ""puts her under his whip""?) Eliza becomes a person without a spiritual home (as poignantly conveyed by a scene in which she returns to her old haunts, and nobody recognizes her), with complex wants (centering on a love-hate relationship with Higgins) and scant satisfaction. She is someone who, if we look beyond the ambiguous ending of the movie, is likely to undergo torment for years, possibly a nervous breakdown.Eliza was better off selling flowers in Covent Garden.This realization casts the movie in a quite different light, as a tragedy perhaps. But then it's a musical, the viewer is probably not expected to take it too seriously, and on that level it is indeed quite ""loverly"" (can't get that tune out of my head...don't want to, either).Taken seriously, it's a different kind of movie entirely; and, as much as I like Henry Higgins' quick wit, in real life I would have to condemn him as among the cruelest of men. ...OK, OK, don't take it seriously...and then it's8/10",My Fair Lady

The tunes of this musical movie are simply unforgettable. And, assisted by the lyrics of Lerner which hewed closely (sometimes even exactly) to the social commentaries of Shaw, the songs are gems.As a young man, my favorite was On the Street Where You Live but I couldn't help being attracted to With a Little Bit of Luck because Stanley Holloway and his crew were simply a riot with their words and antics in this campy and scampy number.Holloway stole the thunder from everyone (even from the venerable Rex Harrison) each time he appeared on a scene. That repartee between him and Harrison (Prof. Higgins) where he chided the latter about his ""middle class morality"" is pure Bernard Shaw social commentary. I simply love his cockney accent and I don't think that rib-tickling song I'm Getting Married in the Morning could be sung without it.

Other than that, tough, nothing really wrong with it. Great songs, delicius one-liners, and excellent performances.  Rex Harrison is wonderful, Audrey is charming (even with the Cockney accent and artificial dialogue), Stanley Holloway is great, though his numbers don't really add anything (But are still fun!), and Gladys Cooper is also good.

And all the people in the 3 sets of the frame move around in a haphazard manner.I beg your pardon lovers of literature, I haven't read the play by George Bernard Shaw nor have i heard about it before watching the film.Professor Higgins takes Eliza as a disciple to experiment on after Col. Pickering throws a challenge that he couldn't make a duchess out of a flower-seller. Professor Higgins, an expert in Phonetics, is a celibate and often looks down on women. He provides her luxury and at the same time forces her to try and try till she enunciates the words correctly. After several exhaustive sessions, Higgins makes her perceive what they're trying to do to her and his words do the miracle. She speaks flawlessly and with a rich and refined voice.Higgins takes her to a horse race, a place where Eliza could interact with the blue-blooded. She does well in the beginning but slowly she starts uttering innuendos and senseless idioms that Higgins and Pickering try to cover up with illogical explanations. Things go back to round one when she screams in enjoyment in the language of the slum-dwellers. Higgins gives her rigorous training and his efforts bear fruit in a matter of time. She draws the attention of several people and a princess showers encomiums on her charisma.Higgins is lauded for his efforts by his fellowmen but they fail to understand Eliza's efforts too; all that she had to endure to become a subject of Higgins' achievement. She leaves the house in agony and swears to never return again. Higgins realizes they are in-execrable but takes time to confess it and comes to him after his long-due confession.",My Fair Lady

142,ALauff,In praise of Hepburn,8,29 September 2006,"Although her singing voice is absent, Audrey Hepburn carries this 1964 adaptation of the famed play with the precision of her diction. Whether warbling through her vowels in torturous cockney squeaks or betraying just a hint of the street in studied dulcet tones afore a rapt royal audience, Hepburn conveys Eliza Doolittle's essential struggle for self, precariously adrift between the person she's pretending to be and her irrepressibly sweet impish nature. In this, a story in which each character's social role is earmarked by their earnestness in upholding acceptable conversational dialect, what we need to know about Eliza at any given moment must be conveyed by the sound of her words. At her best, as in a rebuff to doe-eyed suitor Freddy, these words show a wounded dignity that is heartbreaking. In her pursuit of a better life, she allows herself to be transformed beyond recognition by Henry Higgins. The essential question of the story is whether one can be truly content, no matter how auspicious the environment, in the absence of a true identity. Hepburn convinces in the struggle to find the answer to this question, one we all must answer at some point.",My Fair Lady
143,cinemel,A classic musical beautifully filmed and restored.,9,14 January 1999,"George Cukor's production of My Fair Lady is one of the last of a vanished breed. Beautifully made films of Broadway musicals are relics of a bygone age. Luckily, My Fair Lady was restored to its loverly 70MM splendor just a few years ago and now it can be seen on video reproduced from that superb Super Panavision print.  The two current video incarnations (from 2oth Century-Fox Home Entertainment on laserdisc and Warner Home Video on DVD) are both superb renderings. Rex Harrison's portrayal of Henry Higgins is one of the gems that was preserved from the stage production. We'll never know what Julie Andrews would have done with Eliza Dolittle on the screen, but Audrey Hepburn has nothing to be ashamed of. Her Eliza glows, especially in her scenes at the Embassy Ball and the Ascot races. The score that Lerner & Loewe composed to bring Shaw's Pygmalion to musical life is virtually perfect.  The orchestrations and vocal performances in the film do complete justice to the original. The sets and costumes by Cecil Beaton elaborate on his fine designs for the stage production. The deluxe laserdisc contains an excellect documentary detailing the history of My Fair Lady and its filming.  The newly released DVD has an illuminating commentary by restorers, Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz, art director, Gene Allen, and vocal double for Miss Hepburn, Marni Nixon.  In addition, you can hear what Audrey Hepburn would have sounded like had they used her vocal tracks on the supplementary material on both the DVD and deluxe laserdisc. My Fair Lady is surely an example of the type of film we'll probably never see again. The best they can do is what they did to ""Cats"" in its recently filmed version. It's just not the same. My Fair Lady remains a musical wonder presented in all its appropriate lushness and reverence for the classic that it is.",My Fair Lady
144,Calysta,Disaster on almost all accounts,3,23 January 2000,"By the 1960s, musicals were beginning to sour with the audiences. The great boys and girls of song and dance yesteryear were phasing out. Gene Kelly, Judy Garland and Ginger Rogers were trying their hand at straight dramatic acting, with varied success. Fred Astaire took his top hat and tails somewhere else. Shirley Jones too found her feet out of musical roles and the careers of all at the musical stable plunged with the sad death of the greatest shows on earth.We still had beloved Julie Andrews. Three stage successes. ""The Boy Friend"" and ""Camelot"". But Eliza in ""My Fair Lady"" was for years her best and most defining trademark role. Because life isn't like ""42nd Street"", Julie didn't get to play Eliza.
For box office insurance, Warner wanted Cary Grant. Similar circumstances prevailed two years before when they asked for Grant for ""The Music Man"". Therefore, in part by using Rex Harrison, despite the fact he was not potent box office, was the wisest move they made, along with employing Stanley Holloway to reprise his role. Both perform with great zeal in the roles they were simply born to play. Audrey Hepburn remains one of the greatest actresses of her time. Like all good actors, she summoned personal experience to bring life to the roles. As one of literal fashion ambassadors of her time, she failed oddly to combine tomboyish simplicity and gamine chic with her Eliza. Her accent was horrifying, and in general, her performance lacked the smallest elements of Julie's legendary characterisation. Marni Nixon even, usually doing great cover up jobs by dubbing the non-singers, sounds absolutely atrocious in comparison to Andrews. This is a musical comedy, but instead I found suddenly, various unknown pains never experienced while listening to the original Broadway recording of Julie in ""My Fair Lady"". The Eliza songs lack the depth and beautiful quality that made Julie Eliza and not Audrey. The screenplay was bogged down by boring length in some parts, which simply made an unsuccessful attempt to remain faithful to the stage. On the other hand, it tried to keep intact the piercing social classes commentary of 1912s England. This on all accounts fails.If anyone was capable of mounting a great production of style and elegance in the 30s and 40s, it would be George Cukor. By employing the use of sickening colour cinematography, mediocre sets and costumes, and in short, commissioning a below average screenplay, it is merely a blow to his great career. Even the Lerner and Loewe musical score, one of my all time favourites, is uninspiring and flat. The whole thing should never have been mounted, but by not snapping up these rights it would be similar to passing over ""Gone With the Wind"". ""My Fair Lady"" would have worked to better effect in the 50s as opposed to fast changing attitudes towards musicals of the 60s. Although the 1964 Academy Awards was the night for ""My Fair Lady"", both ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Mary Poppins"" would have suited better to take out the statuette for Best Picture of 1964.I can't complain entirely, actually. I don't know what I would do if Julie wasn't in ""The Sound of Music"". Rating: 3/10",My Fair Lady
145,jery-tillotson-1,My Dull Lady,2,1 April 2020,"I remember all the media coverage of this movie in 1964--mainly the controversy of Warner Brothers mogul, Jack Warner, choosing actress Audrey Hepburn over Julie Andews to play the major star role of Eliza Doolittle. Hepburn was known mainly as a dramatic performer. No one had ever heard her sing before and of course, in ""My Fair Lady"", the main female role called for lots of singing.
Warner explained that Hepburn was a first class ""movie star"" who had proven her mettle in a string of successes and that she was perfectly suited for the challenging role of the street urchin who becomes a grand lady at the hands of a grand gentleman.
Warner was still in the old Hollywood mode of signing up talent with a ""box office"" name, whether they were right for the part or not. He never explained that the main female performer most associated with the Broadway version of this movie was the brilliant and British Julie Andrews. She had already won numerous awards for her performance, had made the Broadway cast recording into a huge success.
The many news articles all mentioned Julie Andrews didn't need anyone dubbing her. She had a voice that was truly phenomenal.
So when the finished product was finally ready to be seen by the public--the $17 million musical did look sumptuous on the screen. Although it still resembled a filmed stage production in many ways and although the costumes and interiors and sets were eye-popping, the sight of Audrey Hepburn mouthing the lyrics to a song performed by Marnix Nixon, was jarring.
Hepburn looked as if she was performing like a robot all the quirks an scowls and bellows that her character was supposed to make--but when she opened her mouth to sing, her lip-synching was sometimes a little off.
Dubbing a movie musical for actors and actresses is as old as talkie movies from the late 1920s. Who can forget the controversy over ""South Pacific"" where every single performer, except for Mitzi Gaynor, were dubbed. In ""West Side Story"", same thing with the exception of Rita Moreno.
But Hepburn was the centerpiece of ""My Fair Lady"" and one would think that at least the performer who took on that major role could at least carry a tune.
Which is why, I think, Julie Andews became a superstar with both ""Mary Poppins"" and especially the spectacular 'Sound of Music."" The audience Knew she was doing her own singing with no fake help of dubbing.
For movie musical lovers, ""My Fair Lady"" is a painless pleasure but that nagging knowledge that the main female star is faking her own vocalizing will always be a shadow over thoroughly enjoying it.",My Fair Lady

That is, Audrey Hepburn was a great beauty no matter what clothes she wore or what her voice sounded like. Beautiful is beautiful. So to see her gussied up like the Queen of the Universe at the conclusion of the film just confirmed what you already knew.Why don't these films (Ms. Congeniality is another one) that take lovely actresses, try to make them plain, and then revert them to what they never stopped being to start with, try just once to really transform somebody? Hey, what are Holly Hunter or Kathy Bates doing lately? I am no fan of Julie Andrews but she did earn this role. Audrey Hepburn was too gorgeous, unable to sing, and thus unbelievable. Well, it was all long ago. My question is, who was Hepburn's voice? Marnie Nixon? I could find no attribution on the video.

The film version is less than mediocre, and sadly, the only permanent visual record of this stage masterpiece. It is obvious that no expense was spared in bringing this show to the screen, but what does it matter? The entire production is so slowly paced and unexciting, that you feel that director George Cukor (who won an undeserved Oscar), embalmed the show. Horribly studio-bound, there is nothing that distinguishes this as a film. It is void of everything that made the show an exciting stage experience. Many of the sets, look like sets, and the make-up, hairstyles and many of the costumes on the women is very 1960's and silly looking for 1912. Eliza Doolittle is the heart and soul of this musical, but Audrey Hepburn's performance of her is so false, that the very life of the show is gone. She's all wide-eyes and and inappropriate smiles (watch the LOVERLY number), with carefully placed smudges. She growls and clenches her fists when she's supposed to; but it just ends up being Audrey Hepburn play acting at being Eliza. She never, ever makes you think she IS Eliza. Also, her accent is wrong. She would never have fooled anyone, with her ""European"" sounding English accent. The dubbing of Miss Hepburn (done after the film was made), is almost as bad as watching a ""Godzilla"" movie. It always looks out of sync, and never sounds right. When one remembers Broadway's original Eliza, Julie Andrews (who should have been in this film), it makes Hepburn's casting even harder to take. Rex Harrison and the supporting cast are first rate; but it is Eliza who must be perfect, and she isn't. Hepburn's miscasting, Cukor's plodding direction, and the failure to recognize that they were making a film, make this a disappointment of the highest degree. NOT recommended!",My Fair Lady
148,gerry-russell-139,The greatest of all musicals,10,11 October 1999,"For all generations there will never be a greater musical film than ""My Fair Lady"". Not ""The Sound of Music"", not ""The King and I"", not ""Oliver!"" not even ""West Side Story"" can compare to the soaring music, striking costumes and lavish sets of this musical masterpiece that won eight academy awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Rex Harrison) and Best Director (George Cukor). Audrey Hepburn is brilliant as Eliza Doolittle and thanks to help Marni Nixon she makes Julie Andrews sound barely admissible. I think Audrey was robbed of her chance at the Oscar nomination for ""Fair Lady"" and I curse all those who thought that she was not that great as Eliza. The film might not have been as great a success if Audrey were not chosen for the part. Julie was great in ""Mary Poppins"" but I can't see her as Eliza on film. I grew up hearing how brilliant she was on stage but I purchased the Broadway cast album about three years ago ('96) and felt that Julie was fine on stage but not in the film.

Freddy Einsyford Hill, played by Jeremy Brett, is the adorable and rather handsome young man who falls for Eliza Dolittle as well. Hepburn and Harrison stole the show, and even though Ms. Hepburn was ad-libbed by Marni Nixon for the singing parts, it didn't really show in the movie. Rex did a wonderful job as Pro. Higgins, and Jeremy Brett.... Well, he was absolutely terrific. I watched this movie for the first time with my best friend, and this movie made me a HUGE fan of Ms. Hepburn.

153,brower8,Does language make the (wo)man?,9,6 February 2004,"-My Fair Lady- is close to perfection if it isn't there. Some may dislike it because they dissent with George Bernard Shaw's premise that language is the most obvious sign of social class in 19th-century Britain. People could have lots of money and be 'low'; someone with the right sort of speech can fool others about one's origins. If one fails to accept this premise, then the movie fails miserably. I accept Shaw's premise that language is nearly everything. Rex Harrison excels in his role as 'Henry Higgins', a pedantic expert who believes that by changing the speech patterns of the lowliest flowermonger 'Eliza Doolittle' (Audrey Hepburn), who must surrender all of the certainties of her proletarian life (including getting away with her low-class speech) to prove her benefactor's theories true. Note well that any slipup in the role ensures that we see Higgins as an unspeakably cruel man performing an unethical experiment. Somehow one can believe his thesis that by changing the speech one can change everything and transform a flowermonger into a debutante -- but we must also feel Eliza's distress at the effort to change her. Sure, it's slow, as noted -- demonstrating how difficult a task Henry Higgins has given himself... and, of course, Eliza Doolittle. Clearly, Higgins has far less to lose than Doolittle. Changing thirty years of 'bad' habits doesn't come easily.What does the experiment achieve? Partial success. Maybe there is more to change than language, as at the horsetrack scene, where Eliza Doolittle charms the superficial characters of the upper crust with her trivialities, only to bring out her proletarian roots to the fore when she gets emotionally involved with the horse race {""Move your bloomin' @rse!"").Finally, Eliza Doolittle gets exposed by one of Higgins' rivals, 'Zoltan Karpathy', (Theodore Bikel), who gets to hear the results of the experiment and concludes that she is a fake -- too good to be true as an Englishwoman! She must be --- Hungarian!Henry Higgins gives all the credit to himself, and none to the one who took the greater sacrifices for little assurance of benefits. That begins a course of events that lead in directions that he can't foresee (and which are spoilers).Is Audrey Hepburn too good to be true? Sure -- she was then spectacularly beautiful once one took her out of rags and put her into 'classier' attire. Could Higgins have succeeded with an older, less-attractive woman? I doubt it. Shaw's contention that language is everything -- more than the content of one's thoughts, more than money, more than years of habits, and more than attractiveness isn't 100% true. But it's close!.",My Fair Lady
154,Theflyace,A Nice Film but Not the Greatest as Many Say,6,19 February 2019,"I've had an interesting relationship with this movie over the young years of my life and I still have mixed feelings about it. My Fair Lady is often cited as one of the greatest films of all time, or at the very least ""the only perfect musical."" Its impact on film culture is indeed undeniable but I agree with the late Robert Osbourne of Turner Classic Movies. He stated that it is a nice movie but it is not essential and it has many problems its contemporaries could have overcome better than this. But I will try to be Fair to the film.The story involves street urchin Eliza (Audrey Hepburn) who's cockney is so thick her peers even comment on it. By happenstance, she encounters an arrogant phonetic expert, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) who believes a person's manner of speech is what separates urchin from duchess. They strike a bargain that he can teach her to speak like a princess and pass her off as one to prove his theory, whereas she could possibly gain proper employment at a flower shop. Their relationship is fraught as both are headstrong and stubborn, but eventually she ""gets it"" and speaks properly. But the question arises: Will Higgin's views and strict teachings help or hinder her?I'll start off with the elements of the film that work very well for me. Rex Harrison nails a mysonginistic character with a heart, he doesn't seem all that aware that what he's saying is hurtful as his passion for what he does blinds him to the heart of the woman he's trying to mold. The supporting cast is decently assembled, with the standout supporting player being Stanley Holloway as Eliza's ne'er do-well alcoholic father Alfie, who gives the movie life it desperately needs at times. I am of the opinion that almost any score from the great duo of Lerner and Lowe is going to be absolutely wonderful and this movie is no exception. There are smatterings of brilliance in the dialogue and the story development but unfortunately this leads into many of the movie's problems.Chief among the films problems is it is far too overblown. The same issue arises in films like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Hello Dolly, the issue of large sets and huge casts of hundreds in costume but have zero zest to them and come off as way to stylized to make an emotional connection. There is a difference between portraying aristocrats with a slight tongue in cheek attitude and then theres this movie where I laughed with incredulity at how people could possibly think this is a great movie. I like George Cukor as a director but here, he tends to keep his cast and sets in medium shots and even wide shots, which does nothing to help the story. And when there are close-ups they are uncomfortable when they are meant to be endearing and vice-versa.I need to address the elephant in the room and discuss Audrey Hepburn's performance and how it ties the the story. I love Audrey Hepburn and when she speaks the part, she is interesting and almost compelling. I do not mind that she was dubbed but Jack Warner made a horrific decision to do so for two reasons: 1) It sounds like most of the cast was not dubbed by someone else (save for Jeremy Brett which itself is odd) thus her dubbing sticks out like a sore thumb
2) Yes Julie Andrews was passed over and once people saw her in Mary Poppins it didn't seem right when the talent was there and an executive didn't even give her a chance to screen test for it
However, this is not my issue with the story or Hepburn's performance, but rather Alan Jay Lerner's screenplay. The dialogue sparkles and the characters established, but the narrative is hopelessly weak as opposed to its source material, Shaw's Pygmalion. Eliza starts as a stubborn urchin who yearns for a life better than rescuing her flowers from puddles. However, she is constantly seen as less than by Higgins, and she decides to strike out on her own. Good for you! But then she decides to complain to his mom and rub it in his face like a woman scorned, which doesn't strike me as a logical progression for her character. And the ending cripples a possibly progressive and powerful message that Shaw achieved wonderfully.So my final thoughts are this. I'm glad this movie means so much for people and it nearly clicked with me, but too many things just prevented me from embracing it. I do not think it was the best film of 1964 by any stretch. I think Mary Poppins, Dr. Strangelove, and even Becket were better films which took risks and delivered something better than this film. I'm glad I've seen it and I even hum some of the songs once and a while, but My Fair Lady isn't a perfect flower for me.",My Fair Lady

And the music is great!Oh, by the way, it's so bizarre to find out that Marni Nixon did all the singing. She also sang for The King and I, and for Westside Story.

156,mpofarrell,"Jack Warner's Spectacular ""Lady""",10,9 February 2004,"It seems hard to believe (among us aging Baby Boomers, that is)that the opulent film version of the famed Broadway musical ""My Fair Lady"" is nearing the 40th anniversary of its original release.When the movie premiered at NY City's Criterion Theatre in late October of 1964, the excitement anticipating its release was almost equal to the commotion that greeted the opening of ""Gone With The Wind"" in 1939. Producer Jack L. Warner spared no expense in transferring the Lerner and Loewe musical adaptation of Shaw's stage play ""Pygmalion"" to the screen. At the then astronomical cost of 17 million dollars, the Warner Brothers Studio artisans created the Edwardian world of Covent Garden, 27A Wimpole Street and environs into some of the most spectacular indoor sets ever created for the movies. Veteran cinematographer Harry Stradling captured all this in glorious Technicolor and Super Panavision 70, his camera lovingly recording for posterity Cecil Beaton's sets and costumes, lavish embellishments of the Broadway show. George Cukor, Hollywood's much revered ""Woman's Director"" guided his actors to thoroughly professional performances, with Rex Harrison dominating the film with his unforgettable portrayal of phonetics expert Henry Higgins, that irascible middle-aged bachelor who wagers a bet with an eminent colleague that in three months he can pass off a hapless flower girl into a duchess at an Embassy Ball. That flower girl, played in the movie by the lovely Audrey Hepburn, was a huge casting bone of contention among critics and public alike. Jack Warner hired Hepburn despite protestations that the original Broadway Eliza Doolittle, Julie Andrews, should repeat her memorable stage performance. But Andrews had never acted in movies, and Warner wanted to hedge his bets with a known name and quantity. In one of the great ironies of movie history, Julie Andrews took Hollywood by storm, starring in Walt Disney's own expensive musical extravaganza, ""Mary Poppins"", which beat ""Fair Lady' to the screen a month earlier. It was ""My Fair Lady"", however, that triumphed at the April 5th, 1965 Oscar ceremony, winning 8 Academy Awards including the coveted Best Picture prize. In a delicious moment of sweet revenge, Julie Andrews picked up the Best Actress award for playing the titular Mary Poppins, the magical English nanny of her own Edwardian England. The other great irony in all this was that Audrey Hepburn failed to receive a Best Actress nomination for her very able work in ""Fair Lady "". The question will always remain whether Andrews would have made ""My Fair Lady "" a better film.Perhaps so. But Hepburn is luminous, especially her transformation into a proper English Lady, where she really comes into her own. Her singing voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon, a prolific ""ghost singer"" for many actresses in film musicals who were not up to snuff in warbling demanding Broadway songs. Both ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins"" were the Crown Jewel entertainments of 1964, a time when the United States was still healing from the terrible emotional scars of the assassination of President Kennedy the year before. Some critics quibbled at the time that producer Warner embalmed ""My Fair Lady"" more than preserved it.Yes, it's stagy in the old fashioned Hollywood sense of the word. It's also a Grand Show that in its original 70 mm presentation was a visual knockout, something hard to duplicate in this age of Home Theatre Entertainment. The movie preserves for posterity one of the most brilliant musicals ever created, and with Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins, one of the greatest stage performances of all time.",My Fair Lady

But I must admit that, whenever MFL is shown on TV, I usually click on to it several times during the showing to try and catch some of the great songs. I could not care less about the storyline or what becomes of any of the characters. Marni Nixon has always been a favorite of mine and she has a voice that is stronger and much more pleasant than that of Julie Andrews, who was rejected by the film's producers for the role of Liza. I also enjoy Stanley Holloway and I was certainly perplexed when I read that he was not the first choice to play Liza's dad in the film.

Audrey Hepburn is a lovely and talented actress and she does a fine job as Eliza Doolittle.

161,abum190,"Great onstage, suffers on screen",7,8 December 2006,"It is strange to me that My Fair Lady has built up so much acclaim over the years. It's charming enough in its own witty way, but there is so much lacking here it is hard to believe that some people really consider it one of the best musicals of all time. In fact, the only reason I gave it a 7 and not a 6 is because of Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison. Their charm alone is enough to elevate it to classic status, and perhaps that is why the movie has lasted so long and so high up in the ranks.Audrey Hepburn is Eliza Doolittle, a dirt poor flower girl who meets Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) on the street one evening when he severely criticizes her pronunciation of the English language. The song at this point in the story, ""Why Can't the English,"" is one of the best in the play, but in the movie it is strangely boring and flat. It seems to me to be a directorial problem- he didn't know what to do with it so therefore he did nothing. It so happens that Professor Higgins meets the esteemed Col. Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) on that same night on the same street, and the Col. makes a bet with the Professor that he cannot make a lady out of Ms. Doolittle. And so follows many a song and clever banter.Audrey Hepburn is wonderful as Eliza, there's no question about that. Julie Andrews, the original Eliza on Broadway, probably could have done as well if not better with the role, but that's Hollywood for you. Hepburn finds key differences and similarities between her lower-class self and her expertly trained but misused self to make Eliza a very real person. Rex Harrison, as stuffy as he makes Professor Higgins, is quite funny and sympathetic. Even when we are aware that he is a big, if well-educated, jerk, we want him to realize his faults and go to Eliza. Despite his skill with this role, his winning Best Actor seems a little much simply because there's not much true acting in the performance, but perhaps he didn't have much competition. And there's no denying how entertaining he is as a chauvinistic pig.Besides the two leads, nothing else is impressive about the movie. Stanley Holloway's (Eliza's dad) numbers, like ""Why Can't the English,"" are some of the best songs in the play, but just aren't much fun on screen. The best sequences in the movie come when Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison perform either together or solo.It's depressing that one of the best musicals onstage just comes across as dull in the movies. Hollywood didn't mess it up with Fiddler on the Roof or Guys and Dolls- so why mess it up with My Fair Lady?",My Fair Lady

Then, at the last minute, everything goes inexplicably wrong. The whole concept of making ""Pygmalion"" into a love story did not feel right from the start: the play itself had a different ending. Why have Eliza (Audrey Hepburn at her most glamorous), reverse her rightful decision to leave her (tor)mentor Higgins (Rex Harrison, at his most eloquent). In the end, she is reduced to the same kind of brainless twit she was always accused of being. It's funny, but on a personal note, ""My Fair Lady"" was the only movie to ever make me cry (at the age of 10, mind you) , because of my frustration with the final scene. Having not yet reached puberty, I had no option but to view Higgins (a charming bastard, who sometimes makes more than a bit of sense) as a shameless pig.

If you the underdog you are nothing
You mean nothing in the world and are only there to serve others
Eliza had a dream to get out of her rut and become someone

It had good music full of Humor and slickness
It showed how the Upppercrust was and the snobbishness that goes with the Upperclass people

166,filmbuff-05706,The Best Musical Move I Will Probably Ever See.,10,18 July 2021,"Musicals are one of my favorite genres of film. While I love movies like The Sound of Music, Singing In The Rain, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang(to name a few), there is one musical that ranks on top, and is sure to stay there. That movie is My Fair Lady.I first discovered this movie when I was about 8(my Mom had it on VHS), but it's 170 minute runtime prevented me from being able to sit through it all. Back then, I didn't like leaving VHS tapes unrewound, so instead of watching it in parts, I just rewound it when I was tired of seeing it.However, when I was about 10, I finally managed to see it from start to finish, and it has since been one of my all time favorite movies. Even today, as a 22 year old, it has a spot in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.My Fair Lady is the story of Eliza Doolittle(played by Audrey Hepburn), a homeless flower girl with a Cockney accent that is unaccepted by society. In fact, a florist shop won't hire her because of her accent. So she seeks the training of Henry Higgins(played by Rex Harrison), a misogynistic speech professor.Through tough exercises(such as saying tongue twisters with a mouthful of marbles), he finally refines her speech and teaches her manners to seem more like royalty than a lifelong vagabond.My Fair Lady is a delight from start to finish, and there is so much that makes it so. To start, the acting is wonderful. This movie was my introduction to Audrey and Rex, and while I have seen other movies of theirs, some very good, they are somewhat tainted when I think of them in this. Their roles as Eliza and Henry simply cannot be topped.The movie is also beautiful to look at. The film greets us with flowers for the opening credits while the overture plays, but then we are given a visual feast of costumes, from the casual clothes they wear on a daily basis to the dress up for a horse race and a ball.The cinematography is also glorious, especially if you see it on Blu-ray. The colors are bright and vibrant, and are once again a visual feast. In fact, My Fair Lady won 8 deserved Oscars, Best Costume Design and Cinematography among them.Speaking of the Oscars, I won't name them all but the movie also won Best Actor for Rex Harrison's performance(though somehow Audrey Hepburn wasn't even NOMINATED for Best Actress, which is an unforgivable sin).Best and most deserving of all, My Fair Lady won Best Picture of 1964, over movies like Mary Poppins and Dr. Strangelove. Both good movies, but not as amazing as My Fair Lady.As I have said, My Fair Lady is a musical, and it has some of the best songs that the genre has to offer. My favorite as a kid was Just You Wait, where Eliza hopes to avenge Henry for overworking her in her training. Now, my favorite is Without You, where Eliza tells him personally that she, and the world itself, could live on without him. Both songs are a bit dark, but their tones make them delightful.There are other great songs as well, such as the most infamous song, I Could Have Danced All Night, in which Eliza(now ""speaking properly""), wishes to have danced with Henry all night, rather than just a few minutes after achieving their goal. For your sake, I won't spoil any more songs, but there are numerous wonderful tunes in My Fair Lady.Ignoring Disney movies, My Fair Lady is also my favorite romance movie ever. While clearly unorthodox for a romance movie(the lovers clearly do not start off on the right foot), the movie does show that the couple eventually learn to love each other.It does not have the clichés of most romance movies(pre-marital sex, forbidden love, corny love confessions), which is the core reason for my bold proclamation. In fact, they only confess their love in songs the other is not present for- Eliza sings I Could Have Danced All Night, and Henry sings I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face, the last song in the movie.While I know guys who do not care for My Fair Lady on the basis that it is a musical, there are many guys who do admire it, my 2 favorite film critics among them.Roger Ebert, in a 4/4 star review, opened with: ""My Fair Lady is the best and most unlikely of musicals, during which I cannot decide if I am happier when the characters are talking or when they are singing."" (My vote is singing, but he makes a worthy point.)Another critic I love, James Berardinelli, concludes his 4/4 star review, with, in paraphrase:""Few genres of films are as magical as musicals, and few musicals are as intelligent and lively as My Fair Lady...Rarely have so many minutes in a theater (been this enjoyable).""James has a list of 113 favorite movies, and My Fair Lady is number 24 on that list.For those who want to bash the film for it's woman-bashing elements, while this doesn't exactly hold up today, there is no reason to bash the film as a whole. Some women I am close to have seen it and adore it. My Grandma even thinks this is a 10/10, a rating that she gives extremely selectively. While women tend to love this movie more, both genders should consider this to be a must see.I could continue on about my love for My Fair Lady, but this should show why this movie is, in my view, better than roughly 99% of the movies I have seen in my lifetime. It takes a lot for a movie to top it. For a musical or movie in general, there are few movies more ""loverly"" than this one!Note: If you have Netflix, the movie is currently on there.",My Fair Lady
167,holdencopywriting,"Lip sync lessons, please.",3,19 February 2009,"The songs and much of the dialogue in My Fair Lady seem to have been recorded in a well. And none of the cast knows how to pretend to sing to the pre-recorded tracks. Marni Nixon's rich and wonderful voice does not seem to fit the skinny Audrey Hepburn, plus Hepburn does an exceptionally poor job of matching facial and body gestures to Nixon's singing. Overall, the film seems forced, phoney, and lacks humor. Scenes that should be raucous and funny are sad and painful to watch (see the mediocre delivery, poor lip syncing, and limp staging of ""Get Me to the Church on Time""). It's quite conceivable that the vulnerable Eliza should mix up father, mentor and lover, and so fall in love with the older Professor Higgins. But Rex Harrison with his concave chest and paunch is unattractive, seems asexual, and appears to be about 200 years older than Hepburn, and any romantic feelings between the two of them are unbelievable. I recommend sticking with the Broadway cast album with Julie Andrews as Eliza. That cast has all the verve and vitality that the movie production of My Fair Lady lacks.P.S.

I can't really watch the entire film, it is too long and drags at parts also apart that the cockney accent and sudden screaming within the film is not very pleasing to watch.

170,whizkids,Isn't it just loverly?,8,9 May 2004,"I realize that that line is probably used a whole lot, but it fits so well with this movie. It's about a flower girl named Eliza Doolittle. She is a common flower girl, nothing special, and that's why a Professor Higgens jots her down in visible speech. He boasts to a Colonel Pickering that within 6 months, he could pass her off as a Duchess at an embassy ball.
She takes him up on that boast, and for six months, he constantly Hammers into her head how to speak correctly, which turns out quite an adventure for him. They make progress, but when tried in public, she embarasses herself immensly. And there's only 6 more weeks until the ball. Time's ticking...This is a wonderful movie, with great songs, lots of laughs, a few D- words, alright, a little more than a few. Higgens uses them quite frequently, but it's quite overlooked. You see the struggle that Eliza goes through, and you just have to stay with her until the end. If you watch this movie, you will truly be enchanted by it. I'm saying this and I'm a boy.

That talentless bisexual Tory tax exile Rex Harrison was also far too OLD at 55, (but looking 65 even even with his hilariously bad wig), and just talked his way through the songs. Giving that 72-year-old McCarthyite Republican Jack Warner the Best Picture Oscar for this unwatchable, overlong, boring, studio bound piece of CRAP was clearly political. Old Hollywood hoped to defeat the New Wave, but thank Christ they lost. If Warner, having blacklisted and named every liberal actor in Hollywood, was going to make an endless and old-fashioned musical he should have at least cast actors who could SING. Fortunately musicals would die, along with Westerns and the studio system itself, by the end of the Sixties. He would help them die by making the equally overlong and miscast ""Camelot"" a few years later.The film should have been made in 1956 with Julie Andrews, or if it had to be in 1964 (they waited too long) with Peter O'Toole as Higgins and Julie or a younger actress (preferably one who could actually sing) as Eliza. This movie is just awful in every possible way, and how anybody today could sit through this endless, racist, sexist thing defies belief. Stanley Holloway - the only member of the main cast who could actually sing - gave the only good performance, even though at 73 he was also far too OLD to play Eliza's father.Oh, and the songs are awful, especially the pathetic ""You Did It"" number, ""sung"" by the unbelievably bland Wilfrid Hyde-White.0/10.",My Fair Lady
173,buzzerbill,One of the great musicals--and one of the great miscastings,7,16 June 2008,"I first saw this film on its original release and have seen it at least a dozen times since. It's a superb film version of one of the very finest musical ever written. Consider: one of George Cukor's best efforts as director; Rex Harrison, Stanley Holloway, Gladys Cooper, Jeremy Brett, Wilfred Hyde-White, Theodore Bikel, Mona Washbourne, as good as cast as you ever might get; Cecil Beaton costumes; some of the most splendid art direction ever; and that wonderful score.Why a seven, then? One of the great miscastings, that's why. Audrey Hepburn is like a void in the role of Eliza. She never gets the cockney accent on the first hour. Post-accent, she is just confused--sentimental and shrewish by turns. If Warner had had any gumption, they would have cast Julie Andrews, who owned the role. And it isn't an easy role, either--I saw a revival of Pygmalion some years ago with Amanda Plummer, who also failed to get the role at all.The musical's departure from Shaw--putting Higgins together with Eliza--has always always struck me as sentimental twaddle which makes nonsense of the underlying themes of the play. It fits Hepburn's performance--unfortunately. And then there is the dubbing from Marnie Nixon, the Great American Voice. Partly because of this, Hepburn's acting in the musical numbers verges on the painful.It's very unfortunate that Harrison's performance--one of the great ones of the 20th century--is saddled with Hepburn's. Thank goodness the rest of the cast is worthy of Harrison.Is this Higgins' story, or Eliza's? Higgins', I think--much more obviously in the original play. That's why this is still a borderline great movie--the casting of Eliza can't completely ruin it. But it knocks a good 30% off the rating.Of course you should see it. But try to look past a sentimental view of Hepburn. In this--and indeed in most of her films, except two or three--she just isn't that good. She isn't even that charming--just annoying.",My Fair Lady
174,felixoscar,Forty Years Old --- and a Remarkable Work Still,10,26 November 2004,"Think of when this was assembled --- few American TV homes had color (none had remotes or a VCR or DVD or Web access). Censorship was still the rule in film (no bedsharing among married couples, no open mouth kisses approved). The closet kept the public's knowledge of the vital and vibrant gay Hollywood a secret (members including, in 1964, thirty five year film veteran, and MFL director George Cukor). Movie theaters in the USA were segregated among races throughout the South (and other places as well).So put this film in the context of the time what do you have: a story from George Bernard Shaw, filmed in glorious color, at a massive budget, with an overwhelming and unique performance by Rex Harrison, and, if your taste, one of the mid-century's grandest scores. Watched it in High Definition TV, wow! A throughly entertaining classic it remains. Ah, and Audrey Hepburn. To me, this Oscar winner is a class act, dazzling of its time.",My Fair Lady
175,syldt1,A classic that ages horribly,6,21 April 2021,"I saw this movie many years ago, probably forty or more...and as a child I was stunned by its magnificence and captivated by Hepburn's, and especially Harrison's, charm. I saw it again last night and I was (predictably) dissapointed. Just to put things in perspective, I love clasics, although not much musicals, but ""The King and I"" is one of my favorite classic movies, so, there you have it. For starters, it is unfair for a 35 years old actress to pretend to be 21. Rex Harrison, who I like quite much, looks also somewhat old for the role, but compensates by the fact that his singing and comedic skills are strong and he is the only reason why Professor Higgins is not completely hateful. He delivers, by far, the best performance of the movie. Hepburn makes an effort to look ragged and dirty, but she is not believable as a street florist. Enter the first act and I start to feel uncomfortable. Eliza yells and her cockney accent is horrid. They sing a few horrible songs too, among cabbages and garbage and I can't find the charm to it. Eliza's father is a drunkard and a dirty far too old philanderer that I don't find charming at all (bless poor Stanley Holloway's soul!). Professor Higgins is obnoxious and pedantic and completely devoid of redeeming qualities (not Harrison's fault). The movie goes on with more forgettable musical numbers. Even the celebrated ""I could have danced all night"" is dissapointing, mostly because the lipsync is atrocious. Proud bachelor Professor Higgings delights us with his (well singed) misogynistic and pedantic songs. Hepburn and Harrison have zero chemistry. Eliza becomes a lady overnight by the sheer force of better diction and nicer clothes. Near the end, the level of misogyny and sexism is repulsive, and I am not one to be offended by these things easily, especially when watching a movie 57 years old. As I stated before, I absolutely love ""The King and I"" (released almost 10 years earlier than MFL) and there can't be a more obnoxious and stubborn character than that of Yul Brynner. But the pedantic King Mongkut of Siam is charming, funny, and deliciously cheeky. Prof. Higgings has no redeeming qualities, nor has he any visible arc and his unabashed low opinion of women in general, which he keeps repeating in his charming songs, at first accepted as funny and quirky, becomes simply bad taste. The romance is ridiculous; not once does he as much as glance at her with anything but indifference. Towards the end, he seems to consider Eliza more as a pet or maid than a woman worth of his respect and his love, and Eliza, seems to be pleased with this arrangement... off she goes to fetch his slippers...How can anyone consider this romantic, is beyond me.",My Fair Lady
176,CorumJI,Shaw is spinning in his grave...,1,11 February 2000,"This lame musical, so grossly overrated, can't hold a candle either to other musicals of the same time (The Music Man) or to the stage play upon which it is based. The musical is woefully miscast at every turn, and I can only say that anyone who thinks well of it has missed the 30s film version and Shaw's wonderful skill.1) Hepburn is a lovely girl, and a good actress. She's a bad choice for the Eliza role because she's TOO lovely. No one in their right mind would believe her as a common guttersnipe. Compare to the 30s Eliza, Wendy Hiller -- who is just plain enough to play her, yet scrubs up excellently.2) Harrison is a lame choice for Higgins, and totally misses the role. Harrison plays him as a cold fish, right to the core, whereas the 30s Higgins, Leslie Howard, nailed it right on -- Higgins is a very passionate man who has subordinated his passion into his language studies. Eliza becomes the subject of his passion -- first as his student, then as a woman (hence Shaw's title, Pygmalion, with Eliza his Galatea).3) All the smaller roles, from Pickering and ""The Count"", to Freddie and Eliza's father, are all far better cast in the 30s film.4) The idea that a play, written by a master of the stage like Shaw, can be converted to a musical is as ridiculous as colorizing a Hitchcock film (and yes, it's true people are stupid enough to have done both). Shaw is arguably the second greatest playwright of the English language (and certainly *one* of the best), and his use of dialogue is as masterful and mindful of its rhythms as Hitchcock's use of light and shadow. The songs in MFL only serve to disrupt those rhythms. The 30s film, mind you, had the screenplay adapted by Shaw himself, so I believe it is safe to presume that the play's rhythms were retained in the film.All in all, if you watch the 30s film before you see MFL, you'll be greatly annoyed with the excess of acclaim given the latter. It's lame at best, and overrated by any measure. I say: *Hack-ptui*.",My Fair Lady
177,davidallen-84122,Credit where credit is due.,8,18 July 2017,"I have never minded dubbing in musical films but why not be honest enough to credit the real singers,on both the opening titles and the record covers ? Marni Nixon's voice was so true and lyrical (I could listen to her all day). She really illuminated the performances of Deborah Kerr and Natalie Wood and did the same for Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady"". Watching Audrey perform to her own vocals on YouTube,I felt suddenly let-down by the dull,lifeless sound;in turn,ruining the visuals.They retained most of Audrey's own voice for 'Just You Wait' and I thought the number was ponderous and wrong (the dream aspect hardly helped either).As soon as Marni's lilting soprano could be heard on the soundtrack, Audrey's performance was elevated too.Those ''stars"" Marni Nixon sang for should have been grateful to her;she must have been a really nice,self-effacing person.One final point that needs clearing up:Walt Disney told Julie Andrews that he would postpone the filming of ""Mary Poppins"" if she was given the chance to play Eliza on screen.There would still have been time for her to do ""The Sound Of Music"" as well.As they say:""That's Hollywood"".",My Fair Lady

I think it was a shame Audrey's singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Audrey looked beautiful in the film.

Can't believe someone in the user comments says 'Rex Harrison was major drawback of the film, he is irritating and shouts out all his lines...' and someone else seems to be fighting a case for Julie Andrews. All I can say is that you guys are running a lost cause. I don't know if Andrews would have played 'Eliza' better than Hepburn. And there is no way of knowing if anyone else could have played 'Prof Higgins' better than Rex Harrison. And who cares. The truth is that 'my Fair Lady', the movie version, will always be remembered for Harrison and Hepburn. Yes, Harrison is speaking out his lines rather than sing and Hepburn's singing voice was dubbed but it worked and it still does. I would prefer Harrison emote his lines rather than 'sing' them sweetly in tune.Coming to Hepburn and Andrews controversy. Well, it seems Rex Harrison wanted Julie Andrews, his co-star in the original broadway production, to play the role of 'Eliza' but Jack Warner wanted Hepburn. And did she play her role well? Well, Rex Harrison once was asked to identify his favorite leading lady. Without hesitation, he replied, ""Audrey Hepburn in MY FAIR LADY"". Andrews went on to do 'Mary Poppins' the same year and won an academy. Good for her. To quote one user below ""She got a LITTLE gig called 'Mary Poppins'...I'm sure NONE OF YOU have heard of it, right?"" Well! my point exactly. You don't have to be a genius to figure out which is a better movie. Even 'Sound of music', supposedly the most popular movie of all times, can hardly be compared with 'My Fair Lady'. Don't you think 'sound of music' is too sweet and syrupy and fit for 13 yr old girls only?And 40 yrs later all these 'ifs' and 'buts' are nonsensical. The fact is that I can't visualize 'My Fair Lady' without Rex Harrison or Audrey Hepburn. Forget all your biases and watch the movie for what it is. And it is a beautiful movie.

Not to mention the visual beauty of Audrey Hepburn, whose physical beauty is only exceeded by her inner beauty. But that isn't why it's my favourite.What makes this film extraordinary is it's language. The argument Henry has with Eliza at his mother's home is my favourite part of the film. It's just two people talking, although Eliza does eventually break out into song.

Audrey Hepburn shines as the assertive from-rags-to-riches woman, and Rex Harrison gets the role of the grumpy insufferable professor just right. (Maybe because Rex himself was insufferable.)The movie's big and fatal flaw is in the ending; I won't spoil anything, but I will say that it made no sense for Eliza to do what she did in the ending. It's also a completely different ending from the play on which the musical was based. For that I draw off one star.",My Fair Lady
182,jwiley-86292,My Favorite Musical,8,13 July 2017,"On paper, I consider My Fair Lady to be almost without flaw. I've read the play it's based on, and I like this version better. (It's really fanficcy when you think about it. Aren't half of all fanfics meant to pair up characters that didn't end up together in the source material?) I can say with confidence that this is the best adaptation of a musical I've ever seen. Hepburn utterly convinced me she was Eliza. I have no complaints regarding her. Despite the film's length of almost three hours, I find it admirable that they cut nothing from the original libretto. Unfortunately, it is not without flaws. Allow me to list them:-Numerous lip-sync failures. -Obvious sound stages in supposed outdoor locations. -The added scene where the maids forcibly strip and bathe Eliza is highly disturbing.-In Eliza's big telling-Higgins-off song, she. . . waters plants???-Ironically, the actors often talk so quickly it's hard for me to understand them. Especially for the part where Higgins pep-talks Eliza by calling her attractive, the guy playing him should be slow and deliberate so that the scene carries overtones that he is uncomfortable about feeling attraction towards her. Furthermore, in the final scene, Rex Harrison isn't sad enough. All of these are conspicuous problems, but I'd sooner re-watch this than any other movie musical. The story is deeply touching, and the character arcs of the protagonists remind me so much of great writers like Jane Austen and Charlotte Brontë. If you're uneasy about possible misogynistic subtext, let me say that Higgins reminds me of multiple romantic leads created by both those women. More to the point, the more imperious he is, the more heartwarming it is when he realizes the error of his ways. That is what makes My Fair Lady so satisfying where Pygmalion wasn't. Still, I'd be open to a remake if only to have a version where no one has 60s hair.",My Fair Lady

D. I LOVE Audrey Hepburn and this film is beneath her as the film grossly detracts from George Bernard Shaw 1913 play.
E. Shaw's 1913 play was ahead of its time regarding gender equality: Eliza asserts her independence at the end. In the 1964 (yes 1964) the musical has Eliza submitting to Higgins and fetching his slippers?
F. This film won 8 academy awards which shows how the academy is constantly wrong on all levels: Best picture over Mary Poppins or Becket? Best Actor Rex Harrison over Richard Burton or Peter O'Toole in Becket?

184,jwardww,With a Little Bit of...Vocal Training?,6,6 August 2009,"The most musically accomplished Broadway show was ruined before it ever went Hollywood. Rex Harrison, who had done very good work playing Sir Alfred de Carter opposite Linda Darnell as a Svengali-like orchestra conductor in the movie Unfaithfully Yours, never should have been cast as Higgins. Even he thought so, despite being recommended by Noel Coward (who could sing). A non-singer and obnoxiously proud of it, Harrison cramped the style of composer Frederick Loewe from the start. Opening night in New Haven was nearly cancelled due to Harrison's cold feet. One is tempted to imagine what Loewe might have written for a vocal powerhouse, given the other treats in the score. Nevertheless, he gave Higgins wonderful songs. Listen for the melodies carried by the orchestra as Harrison croaks along or ignores the music altogether in his manly affectation. Aesthetically, one would think, the role calls for a baritone as musically splendid as he was linguistically sophisticated. Of course, the defense of Harrison is that his superb acting made up for the vocal debacle, which is not true. In the movie of the play, Leslie Howard's performance of Higgins is infinitely better. Future producers should simply look to performers such as Tony Yazbeck to cast the role, men who have the vocal charisma to characterize Henry Higgins in a musical. Higgins should have over-the-top music like that of a Rossini tenor at the start and sober up into plainsong as the spell of Eliza brings him low. Her music should have the opposite arc, with a Matilde di Shabran fireworks finish. As it is, the movie is more watchable for the Cecil Beaton art direction, the Cukor direction and the the Shaw wit. Audrey Hepburn had her moments as a film star, but she plays Eliza as a variation of her Princess Ann in Roman Holiday--this time a royal pretending to be a Cockney, who goes back to being a royal. But that doesn't really work dramatically, because the play Pygmalion shows that the newly minted princess is much more interesting than a real princess would ever be when she dumps Higgins like so many wilted violets. Hepburn's performance here is as disembodied and unsympathetic as Kiri Te Kanewa's recorded Eliza. One gets the distinct feeling that these two women believe it's more respectable to be a princess, and that we as an audience must not forget that in real life they are refined and important performers...and that's a bit of a bore. In the end, Hepburn could not do justice to all that glorious music written for her, even in a pantomime, unlike Marion Cotillard's sensational turn as Piaf. But in this production nobody can sing. Even the voice of Freddy Hill--who has the greatest love ballad of all time, On The Street Where You Live--was dubbed.",My Fair Lady

187,jkysharma,Wouldn't It Be Loverly ?,8,6 June 2009,"I hadn't got around to watching My Fair Lady in one sitting; it was always a song here and a clip there. To call this a delightful musical would be tantamount to stating the obvious but then that's precisely what this piece of cinema is and in pronouncing this most British of words, one is probably summing up the movie experience. As such it belongs to that select category of films that attain perfection by way of charming their audience. There are scenes and songs one might chop out of the equation for the sake of brevity but none that would make it any better. The usual rules of cinematic expression do not apply to musicals and they certainly don't hold for 'My Fair Lady'.An adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, in turn based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, the film involves the efforts of Prof. Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), a phonetics expert, high browed and misogynistic, to pass off a common flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) (""so deliciously low"") as a Duchess at an embassy ball.The now inimitable Rex Harrison - Audrey Hepburn combine are a treat to watch, especially Hepburn. Even when you consider the fact that Julie Andrews played Eliza Doolittle in the Broadway production it's hard to imagine anyone but Audrey Hepburn essaying Eliza. Early in the film, she resorts to rebuffs employing facial gestures and 'guttural sounds'. Later, when confronted by the issue of identity, she deals with it and exacts her own in clinical lady-like fashion! The transformation, even though given the slightest of treatments, makes for compelling viewing primarily because of Hepburn's ability to breathe a bit of her own grace and poise into end personae that could have, in lesser hands, become caricatures. In fact, Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins very nearly veers off into this territory. One isn't sure whether it is the disinterested actor (he was initially hesitant on reprising the role on film) or the fact that this is a character with such clear delineation, leaving little room for improvisation. In the end, it is the post-ball scenes that call for Harrison to step up and though you are with Hepburn towards the end, you can't help but sympathize with the former's attempts at portraying the predicament of having to reevaluate his attitude towards a person who's very nearly his own creation. He does so and these scenes probably landed him the Academy Award (given the jury's fondness for musicals it would have been his either way).Lacing all this are the songs by the Lerner-Loewe duo. Alan Jay Lerner (lyricist) and Frederick 'Fritz' Loewe (composer) hit all the right notes and the result is the most popular of what are known as the 'Lerner-Loewe Musicals' (Gigi, Camelot, Brigadoon, Paint My Wagon). Lerner's insistence at taking weeks for a line or two hints at an obsession for the right verse but it pays off here and how! 'All I want is a room somewhere' and 'Just you white' are now part of popular culture. Lines like 'The French don't care how a thing's done as long as they pronounce it correctly' reflect well upon Lerner's oeuvre. Loewe's tunes log themselves instantly in the conscious in spite of Harrison's voicing rather than singing the songs.",My Fair Lady

189,jrc007,Has its good and bad points.,10,20 June 2002,"There may be some inadvertent spoilers in here, so proceed with caution.I normally dislike Lerner/Loewe musicals (especially GIGI) because of their slow pace, forgetful songs, wooden acting, and speak-singing. In the case of 1964's MY FAIR LADY, some of these elements return, but others thankfully do not.I'll comment on the bad first, to save the best for last.
Rex Harrison was the major drawback of the film. Yes, he won the Oscar for Best Actor for this, but how? If the delightful and radiant Audrey Hepburn was passed over (and not even nominated at that!) for Julie Andrews in MARY POPPINS of all things, how did Harrison manage? How did he beat out Peter Sellers for DR. STRANGELOVE? He's irritating the whole way through, and he screams all of his lines as if he were stranded on a tarmac at La Guardia. He did not sing his songs, but rather spoke them quickly, a Lerner/Loewe trademark as in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS and GIGI as well.
Wilfrid Hyde-White's character of Pickering was utterly pointless! Whatever Rex Harrison demanded, he followed right along without qualm. The musical would've have been almost exactly the same without him. He was such a follower! Also, if Eliza Doolittle said ""I'm a good girl, I am!"" one more time, I was going to reach through the television and slap her. The length of the film also detracted. If it were, say, forty-five minutes shorter, it would've been improved greatly. Now the good.Two simple words:    AUDREY HEPBURN.Need I say more?Also good were the songs WOULDN'T IT BE LOVELY, WHY CAN'T THE ENGLISH, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK, THE RAIN IN SPAIN, and GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME. Stanley Holloway was very good in his role as Eliza's drunk old father. George Cukor did a good job directing this film, and was basically his last great film before his death 19 years later. I don't know if this really deserved Best Picture over DR.

191,AH-54,Audrey Hepburn is definitely more than just a Fair Lady.,10,14 July 1999,"While many consider Audrey to have been miscast as Eliza Doolittle, I thought she was perfectly lovable as Eliza, especially in the musical scenes.  I couldn't help but admire her beauty, even when she was on the streets selling flowers.Rex Harrison is just as great as the gruffly lovable professor Higgins. This is really a fun Musical which is terribly underrated.",My Fair Lady
192,elf67,One of the great movie musicals,9,2 August 2001,"This is one of the great movie musicals, with a fantastic score and a witty book that owes a lot to George Bernard Shaw. I rate it a 9 or 10. Rex Harrison owns his role, thus carrying much of the film (the way Yul Brynner carries ""The King and I"" or Robert Preston carries ""The Music Man""). Stylish direction, as usual, from Cukor. The one flaw is Audrey Hepburn's lack of singing -- her songs are actually sung by Marni Nixon. Nothing against Hepburn, but one wonders how Julie Andrews would have shone in the film.",My Fair Lady

The costumes, indoor and outdoor scenes are glorious and I was captivated by the story from start to finish. It has great songs, some of which are famous and I didn't know were attributed to this musical and the two leads, particularly Audrey Hepburn, sing and act really well.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will definitely be watching it again.",My Fair Lady
194,Jim B-2,"Loverly, loverly, loverly",10,9 August 1999,"One of the five greatest musicals of all time. Rex Harrison was the the superb pompous character he was supposed to be. The Audrey Hepburn/Julie Andrews debate is for would-be casting directors. Julie is magnificent and Audrey cannot compare as a singer. But Audrey is a glorious waif and with the singing of Marni Nixon, Hollywood's greatest dubbed singer, who cares? Movies should not be evaluated by who might have played a role, but by the job done by those who did! Eliza's father and his role are wonderful. Obviously it wasn't that important to the plot, but what does plot have to do with a great Musical? The songs are wonderful and memorable. Oh, but it was great. Better than all the chocolates imaginable!",My Fair Lady
195,r_j_t_kelly,Cecil Beaton's contribution deserves special mention,10,15 August 2006,"What lifts this film from the very good to the magnificent is, in fact, its design. Designers seldom are credited with the same respect that cinematographers are - and I've always found this odd: after all, someone has to put it there to be photographed - think of the way that the praise is accorded to Storaro for ""The Conformist"" with seldom a mention of Ferdinando Scarfiotti's flawless sense of line, texture and pattern - but in this case, the design is so central to how the film works that it is perverse to consider it in its usual lowly position. The work of Cecil Beaton, most famously the Ascot scene in its Beardsley grey, black and white, is astounding in its daring and beauty. It's impossible to imagine that it would enjoy the position that it does were it not for the alchemy of Beaton, who does wonderful work on ""Gigi"" and ""On A Clear Day..."" but on ""My Fair Lady"" produces the sort of effects that can make you draw breath more deeply.",My Fair Lady
196,joe_lvn,One of the most wonderful films ever made.,10,17 July 2007,"I first saw this film in a theater in 1969, I believe when it was re-released. I was only 7 or 8 years old at the time. My parents saw the original stage play in 1956 in Philadelphia right before it even opened officially on Broadway in New York. They told me all about how they loved the play and especially emphasized how the audience went wild during certain scenes (particularly the Ascot races). And I must say that the film certainly lived up to my parents' hype regarding the stage version. I always think of my parents each time I see it.I really believe that Audrey Hepburn should have won Best Actress that year, even if she didn't do her own singing. That made no difference to me at all. Julie Andrews may have been great too in ""Mary Poppins"", but to me, the performance that Audrey gave was more of a stretch acting-wise. This is my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie anyway. And she was truly LOVERLY!!!!!!!!!Some of the reviews here criticize this film for casting Audrey Hepburn instead of Julie Andrews and make a point of saying how much better ""The Sound of Music"" was (with Julie). First of all, Julie Andrews was unable to make MFL since she was making ""Mary Poppins"" at that time. And regarding ""The Sound of Music"", one could also say that Mary Martin should have been in it since she WAS the original Maria von Trapp in the original Broadway version of that film, and the songs in TSoM were written specifically with Mary Martin in mind. Granted, Julie Andrews did do her own singing in TSoM, but just because Audrey didn't in MFL, doesn't, in my opinion, bother me. And remember, Natalie Wood didn't sing in West Side Story, either.But anyway, I feel this is a great movie for the ages and a must-see.",My Fair Lady
197,Dimitri44,Who was the fairest lady?,10,23 May 2010,"Over the years, troubling questions are sometimes asked about the way the Oscars went that year. Here is what happened in 1964. In order to still know this, you have to be a real oldster like me. Since the 1950's, people were really patiently wondering, when oh when will the movie version arrive, so we can see only those two, Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews. What happened was that Jack Warner, who was probably already my age even then, said: ""She's not good box office!"" I'm not making this up. So everyone in the world was surprised when one of the two stars was missing.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was certainly surprised, and so that is why the other three major Oscars all went for MFL. Yes, they then did give Julie Andrews her Oscar, for Mary Poppins.Years later, I was disappointed to see Audrey Hepburn on TV offer a few unkind words for Julie Andrews. Don't get me wrong. If there was any actress I truly adored, it was always Audrey Hepburn. If I were Rex Harrison, I would have wanted to offer Audrey Hepburn a little light (fos, from the song Ela Se Mena by Manos Hadzidakis) and graciously correct her on this.Oops, Jack Warner also disappointed Audrey Hepburn later on by suddenly announcing the dubbed voice of Marni Nixon, such that Audrey Hepburn's earlier singing lessons went for naught. It could be that Mr. Warner also hadn't heard Audrey Hepburn's memorable singing in her previous movie Funny Face.Postscript: I just watched MFL on the YouTube, and this was after many, many years from the palace type theater days; and now I am beginning to change my mind (with 0 out of 5 votes, I must sound like Higgins). When Jack Warner made the zany remark about Julie Andrews (""She's not good box office."") maybe he was almost vainly searching for an excuse. Considering how Audrey Hepburn had previously burst upon the Hollywood scene, maybe by then he couldn't help it.",My Fair Lady
198,cacaescher,Great Musical! Really beautiful and gracious,8,19 May 2021,"Loved the musical! Audrey's grace is impeccable and the costumes, setting, songs are simply amazing!!! The only thing that was a bit weird was her singing, because Audrey didn't actually sing herself, it was someone else singing for her. Either ways a great movie. Wish I could see Julie Andrews as Eliza. She would be fantastic. Simply fantastic. In conclusion, I recommend watching it 100%, but do not do the same thing as I did, spent the entire movie imaging Julie acting and how she would do this and that and remembering her songs from the Broadway show album. Watch it with a peaceful conscience hahahah.",My Fair Lady
199,jrichards2-1,Brilliant but a sad ending,7,25 December 2004,"Yes, this is a lovely film. I always enjoy watching it; of course, that has absolutely nothing to do with gorgeous Rex Harrison and his scandalous Professor Higgins...I adore some of the songs, though I admit they're light and not the kind of things to really take to heart. One of my favourite characters is Eliza's father, and his song 'With A Little Bit O' Luck' is hilarious.My only problem is with the ending, though. Am I the only person alive who thinks it's sad? The Prof clearly isn't going to change much, and I can't see them marrying or sharing anything but a chummy relationship. I wonder how long the beautiful Eliza will be satisfied with such an arrangement.This film is very much of its time, I think. To an extent the themes are dated, but there is enough charm, in my opinion, to keep it sparkling. I wouldn't put it right up there with, say, The Sound of Music, but still good.",My Fair Lady
200,nanckou,A True Classic That Never Ages,10,21 October 2021,"How many films can be just as fresh and enjoyable after nearly 60 years as they were the first time you saw them? I loved My Fair Lady when I saw it ""first run"" in the theater, as a matter of fact we had the Broadway cast album and I played it endlessly. So watching it now after many years, knowing every line of every song, and marveling over the sharpness of the lyrics again (as well as the dialogue) was such a treat. And of course, the sweetness of the music completes the musical package.There is no way a person can watch this only one time and take everything in. For example, during the scene at Ascot you want to look at each of the fabulous black and white costumes, and those wild hats. But if you do, you'll miss the hysterically dry humor of the lyrics.And speaking of costumes, when Hepburn appears on the stairs in that incredible ball gown, has anyone ever looked more gorgeous in any movie?They stopped making movies like this a long time ago.",My Fair Lady
201,david-frieze,Still luvverly after all these years,10,13 March 2011,"I realized, watching ""My Fair Lady"" again for about the tenth time, that the two biggest films of the year it came out - the other was ""Mary Poppins"" - were both lavish American musicals set in an idealized version of Edwardian London. They both had Julie Andrews in common as well, since she had been in the original stage production of ""My Fair Lady"" but was passed over for the film version because she had never made a film before. Audrey Hepburn is quite good as the illiterate flower girl who becomes an elegant society woman as the result of a bet, but the performers who really ignite this film are the two holdovers from Broadway: Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway. After a very, very long run in New York, these two veteran English actors completely inhabited their roles. Neither one puts a foot wrong, and Harrison is simply spectacular; it's by far the best work he did in Hollywood. Director George Cukor was one of the greats - it's astonishing to look through his entry on IMDb and notice just how many classic films he directed - but his strengths were in performance and pacing. The camera-work is undistinguished, to put it nicely, and the vast sets are detailed and beautiful without actually ""saying"" much about the characters who inhabit them. Still, the music is timeless, the performances are excellent, and Bernard Shaw's original story (the play ""Pygmalion"") holds up superbly after more than a century. ""My Fair Lady"" is worth watching more than ten times, simply for the pleasure of seeing what Hollywood could do when it still took stories seriously.",My Fair Lady
202,smaniaci,Dazzling!,10,30 June 2001,"""My Fair Lady"" is a dazzling film!  That is in part because I love musicals. The excellent ones are the best.  ""My Fair Lady"" is certainly no exception. It is brilliantly filmed in Technicolor.  Plus, there are so many well-loved tunes.  ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" is a necessary song for a musical such as ""My Fair Lady.""  Eliza can't hold back her joy, and I love that scene.  Very soon, though, it is time for her to rest.  Marni Nixon's dubbed singing voice for the character Eliza, from the soundtrack, is also what I have a passion for.  It truly makes me want to dance.  Sometimes there is nothing better, or more that I want to do.  I love this movie indeed.  According to the critics and myself, it deserves a 10, no doubt. My love of movies, particularly old ones, began with this one.  Not necessarily for the high-society theme, but for the music itself. Sometimes I feel that I could watch this and several other ones over and over again.",My Fair Lady
203,dxia,Almost Brilliant,8,14 March 2004,"During the first two hours of this movie, I had thought that it was the greatest musical ever brought to film. It's only during the last hour that it begins to languish and plod. If the first two hours are a solid 10/10, then the last hour is about a 4/10. It brings the average to about 8/10, which is exactly what I gave the movie, but it's fun to think about how great the movie could have been had the producers decided to find a better ending to an otherwise superb story.It goes to show that film is a tricky medium, and regardless of how great musicals can be, live action simply isn't as interesting when it's recorded. 'My Fair Lady' could have used a bit of trimming, especially in Stanley Holloway's pieces, WITH A BIT OF LUCK and GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME. Although they may have been spectacular to see on stage, movie audiences will yearn to see more about Eliza and wonder why the director spends so much time on her father.On the brighter side, I believe that I have never seen Audrey Hepburn in a more perfect role. Eliza Doolittle is a lot like she, in their rise from poverty. And watching Audrey is like being invited to see a person shine in their most perfect niche. She isn't gorgeous in a modern sense, but even a decade after her death, her image still carries that immortal appeal. Some critics call it the ""it"" factor. We don't know what ""it"" is but we know it's there.Billy Wilder once said, ""God kissed her face, and there she was."" For me, I just like her smile, and my smile when I watch her exuberance in one of the defining roles in her career.",My Fair Lady
204,GooseReviews,Classic,6,24 May 2017,"A movie from 1964, directed by George Cukor. Starring Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway. The story of Eliza Doolittle, poor flower girl, and Henry Higgins, rich phonetics professor. Professor Higgins agrees to teach Eliza how to speak correctly in English. Both will have benefits of it: Eliza should find a better job, and professor Higgins will win a bet. The story is very simple but well written. Great acting, great music and great choreography. I liked it, but to be honest I was bored sometimes.",My Fair Lady
205,Tweedtheatre,What a wonderful movie!,10,15 August 2002,"I'm not a big fan of the older musicals, but this musical and then this movie are very well done.  You will notice that My Fair Lady is on the top 250 list and Sound of Music is not.  My Fair Lady is just one good time filled with wonderful performances from all of its actors.  Catch out this film even if you don't love musicals!",My Fair Lady
206,win-3,Witty and glamorous pictures but...,9,3 March 2000,"Undoubtedly,everything in this movie was so superb,though there were somewhat confusions in film editing(in the middle and at the end of horse race scenery) and wrong expressions of Audrey in some points when she was singing""Just you wait"" and ""I could have danced all night"".Only one shot that she did her own best was the time she could successfully pronounce ""The Rain in Spain.."".Anyway, Eliza should be around 21 as Colonel Pickering informed a police. But her look in this film was over 30.Maybe 35 up.If the producers had made this film 10 years before when Audrey was so real young and beautiful as Princess in""Roman Holiday"",""My Fair Lady"" would have been the completely fairest lady of all time.",My Fair Lady
207,d-48544,My Fair Lady,8,24 May 2020,"A very old film, suddenly watched on a whim. Audrey Hepburn's identity in ""the kind and beautiful girl"" is a flower seller at the bottom of society, vulgar in speech, fierce in behavior, clever in order to survive, and an alcoholic father. By chance, I met two linguists, and because of their bets, they were lucky to be the experimenters who had been transformed into ladies. Under the careful guidance of one of the linguists, Hepburn completed the process of turning sparrows into Phoenix, and at a grand party. Get in the limelight. The end of the film falls into the cliche of the general film, the linguist who holds the idea of celilism, unwittingly fell in love with Hepburn, and finally had a happy ending.
The film reveals that standard voice, gentleman and lady behavior and personal accomplishment are the standards of the middle class and upper class of that era, and people who do not have these conditions will be looked down upon. But for the sake of gentlemen and ladies in the eyes of all, the morality of the middle class became bound, losing the original free life and mind, as was the case with Hepburn's drinking father. Our lives now.Is there anything in common?
The story of linguists and flower sellers seems to be an example of love overcoming identity disparities, but if a flower seller does not become a lady and does not meet the basic conditions for a woman to enter the middle class, linguists will never fall in love with her overnight. After all, the story is that the story satisfies the fantasies of ordinary people. After reading it, life still has to go on.",My Fair Lady
208,chtellez,One of the great films of all time--and a social critique at that,10,2 October 2021,"My Fair Lady is an entertaining, funny, beautiful, and charming take on the myth f Pygmalion. The sculptor tat falls in love with his creation. Some may find it dated, but that would be a misunderstanding of how the arts represent their time. In this particular case, it represents the 60s representing Edwardian England. If your mind is open, you will get wonderful lessons about class, misogynism, the patriarchy and how someone's image, deportment and speech still can advance you in society. It is also not sentimental about the possible relationships between men and women, especially a narcissistic professor and an aspiring poor woman trying to find her way in a society that has nothing for her. The music is lovely, if occasionally overwrought. Rex Harrison's sprechstimme-like musical speech is a joy to experience. The conversation between Professor Higgins and Eliza at the end is the most honest love dialogue between two initially incompatible individuals, as they get ready to face a situation not tolerated in his social circle by also overcoming personal limitations. The look is deliciously artificial, as it was done in the 60s, with Cecil Beaton's displaying the breadth of his talent as a designer with the clothing and the sets. Audrey Hepburn is possibly too exquisite as a Cockney flower girl but perfect after her transformation. It does not matter. Her magnetism is such that all that is forgotten. The fact that she did not win the Oscar is more a result of professional politics than of merit. My Fair Lady grows on you. Do not miss it.",My Fair Lady
209,basford,"Enjoyable, but misses the point almost entirely",6,9 January 2006,"My Fair Lady is an American musical based on Bernard Shaw's masterpiece 'Pygmalion'. It does not quite show the point of the play, which was Shaw's message to the audience about whether people really should be put in different classes. the comedy in the story is Higgins's arrogance and Eliza's lower classness clashing with the upper class. My Fair Lady does show the comedy, but strays away from the point of the story. The film for some reason concentrates on the romance between Freddy and Eliza and Higgins and Eliza which is NOT relevant to the story. They also deliberately changed the tea scene to the races at Ascots, which there really wasn't any need to do, anyone who thinks that they can re-write Shaw's work better than Shaw himself are very much mistaken. Thankfully, what saves this film is Sir Rex Harrison's brilliant performance as Higgins and bringing the spirit of the play into the film. Audrey Hepburn does try as Eliza, but un-fortunatly she doesn't grasp it. In her defence, she did not spend a lot of time in Britain. Wilfrid Hyde White, Stanley Holloway, Gladys Cooper and Jeremy Brett were all fine choices for their roles and there are good songs in it (even though they do help the film stray away from the spirit of the play). I did actually see this before i saw the fantastic and (much better than this) 1938 film 'Pygmalion' with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller, where they do stick to the original play and that film is a legend.I strongly recommend this film if you love musicals (which i don't) but if you respect Shaw, you must see Pygmalion first, understand what it really is about and then watch this so you can understand what i mean.",My Fair Lady
210,danielt-06803,Very long,1,14 January 2021,"It's very long and not epic. All of it could be summed up in 80 minutes. Nobody should see this film, and this idiocy won Oscars over Dr. Strangelove.",My Fair Lady
211,raaesquire,My Fabulous Lady,8,4 August 2005,"I never liked My Fair Lady when I was a young lad. For me, the films starring Julie Andrews were perfect to watch as a kid (you know, the Sound of Music and Mary Poppins). I do remember watching Lady once when I was four, and I remember the first scenes of the film, Higgins' drawing room sequences and the Ascot Gavotte number. It wasn't until this year that I actually got down to watching My Fair Lady for the first time, really. After getting back into musicals in my Musical Theatre course in college, I was reading my textbook and was dumbfounded that this musical, which was hailed by the book's author as the last great musical of the 20th century, wasn't even mentioned in my class. Rather, we covered much more inferior plays such as Hair (shudder) and Rocky Horror. I purchased the Original Cast recording with Julie Andrews as Eliza Doolittle, and I enjoyed it immensely; I could visualize what was going on in the movie, and I decided I had to watch it. All I could say was after 170 glorious minutes was that My Fair Lady was easily my favorite film. It is the best adaptation - the most faithful one, for that matter - of a Broadway play. Yes, I may be shunned for saying Lady is better than West Side Story and the Sound of Music, but tastes differ I suppose. The cinematography is glorious, filmed with lush colors and bright textures. The acting is superb and the music is to die for. Yet, there are flaws. I Could Have Danced All Night was in a different key and it just didn't sound as cheerful as the version from the play. Get Me To the Church on Time is doubled in length in the film, focusing too much on Alfie Doolittle a bit too much (although his character is a very dynamic addition to the plot of Lady). You can tell where Marni Nixon dubs Audrey Hepburn, especially in Just You Wait, but that's not a huge distraction. The sets may seem stagy at times, especially with Ascot and portions of Higgins' drawing room. Yet, all of these nuances are minor and they won't deter you from enjoying this film overall. My Fair Lady won 8 Oscars including Best Picture, although I do feel Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove should have won the big awards. Yes, even Peter Sellers had a better performance than Mr. Harrison, who gets Henry Higgins down to a 'T.' Audrey Hepburn delivers the performance of her career, and you'll be saying 'Julie who?' after watching this. She deserved to be nominated for the Oscar and more importantly, she deserved to win. Even if it didn't take top awards, My Fair Lady is one of the best motion pictures ever made. It is also a great spin on one of the greatest stories ever told. Watch this, and it'll make you say, 'They don't make 'em like that anymore!'",My Fair Lady

215,ccasey-1,"Great in the theatre, but not on DVD",8,13 August 2005,"Although a brilliant movie, there are three problems with My Fair Lady on DVD: 1) the movie was designed to viewed on the big screen, 2) the audio commentary is poor and 3) Audrey Hepburn.1) Cukor shot this movie as a direct adaptation from the stage, which was appropriate for theatrical release, but not for home viewing. For example, a great deal of action in this movie is conveyed via the actor's facial expressions. However, Cukor frequently includes wide-angle shots that encompass the entire set. Appropriate enough for the theatre, but a great deal is lost when viewing at home, even on a larger flat-screen monitor.2) I listened to about an hour of the audio commentary and then could bear no more. It is largely a bitching session about how difficult it was to restore the film, containing technical detail appropriate for a UCLA film school student, but not the general public.3) Audrey Hepburn was a great actor. I've seen a number of her films on the big screen at the Stanford Theatre (a wonderfully restored theatre in Palo Alto that screens the classics). However, Audrey overacts Eliza the guttersnipe and her lip sync performance is embarrassing. She nearly recovers with her Ascot performance, which is absolutely stunning and hilarious. This is Audrey at her best. However, clearly this is a role meant for Julie Andrews. Like Rex Harrison, Julie mastered this role on the stage, and she would have been absolutely perfect in the movie. For a glimpse into how Andrews performed this role on stage, get the soundtrack for the original play featuring Harrison and Andrews.",My Fair Lady
216,classic_sara,My Favorite Lady,10,13 March 2005,"My fair lady has got to be one of my favorite musicals of all time. I love the music. The songs are so catchy and so much fun to sing especially ""I Could Have Danced All Night"", ""Wouldn't It Be Lovely"", ""The Street Where You Live"" and ""With A Little Bit Of Luck"". The performances are outstanding. Rex Harrison is my favorite of the bunch. His singing blows me away and his acting, well lets just say he is Professor Henry Higgens. Some people have complain that Julie Andrews should have played Eliza but in my opinion Audrey Hepburn gives another one of her finest performances ever. I have always loved Audrey Hepburn and in My Fair Lady she proves that she is one of the greatest ladies ever on the big screen. She proves she is a lady and a great actress. Stanley Holloway gives a fantastic performance as Eliza's father with his hilarious acting and great singing and the whole supporting cast is wonderful. My fair Lady is no doubt a classic that will be remembered for many years to come.",My Fair Lady
217,Dewhistle,"Nonsense, absolute rubbish.",4,11 May 2008,"I only gave this a rating of 4 because the cast certainly had something.. in fact, if they had made Pygmalion with Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, I'd applaud the casting choices. But why in the name of all that is good do so many people feel it necessary, or even a good idea, to take something that was already good, gut it to make room for songs, then jam into the holes the corniest songs and the campiest choreography? How many perfectly good stories are to be ruined this way? If you like musicals, I suppose I could recommend this. For everyone who likes good music, and to see plays the way they were written, skip it. The terrible songs (and sad to say, in this case, terrible singing) will haunt you even after the movie is over.",My Fair Lady
218,Henry-19,A true Classic,8,28 January 1999,"As I watched this marvellous musical again after a period of years, I was struck by the fact of how stagebound it is. Despite the lavish sets and costumes and the fine cinematography, it is essentially the same show as on the stage. There are no exterior shots everything is filmed in the studio, scenes are set up in a very theatrical manner. Everything is nice and clean, the streets seem empty and rather unreal.Yet despite this, it all works. One gets caught up in it. This is due to the performances of the principals, Rex Harrison (wonderful!) Wilfred Hyde-White (Never better) Stanley Holloway and the Fair Lady herself Audrey Hepburn ( despite her dodgy accents), George Cukors fine direction (keeping a firm hand on things, but letting it speak for itself), Lerner and Lowes wonderful music and the witty script.As is always said they don't make them like this any more, and how could they now? Who could play them as well? A true classic.",My Fair Lady

Its one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get sick of.The beautiful and graceful Audrey Hepburn is perfect as Eliza Doolittle, and although there was controversy over the role, she was the best choice, even if her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Professor Henry Higgins is portrayed wonderfully by Rex Harrison, he is the only person I can ever really see in the role. The other characters were well cast too.Lerner and Loewe created beautiful music for a beautiful movie. Rex Harrison perfected talk-singing to music, and his songs are clever and well written. There are lots of great songs such as 'I could have danced all night', 'a little bit of luck', 'wouldn't it be loverly', 'show me', 'on the street where you live' and 'without you'.It is a long movie, and the plot slows down after the ball. And although I am not totally happy about the ending because it is left very open, I cannot think of another way to end the film that would be better.My Fair Lady is a terrific movie. It has a certain thing about it that just makes you want to stand up and start singing. I love it and would recommend it to everyone.",My Fair Lady
220,noleander,Great music but offensive storyline,5,5 March 2007,"I love musicals, and the music in My Fair Lady contains some of my favorite tunes.But I just watched it again now in 2007 (perhaps my fifth watching) and the relationship between Higgins and Eliza was just downright sickening.Standards are changing, for the better. And what was acceptable in 1960 is not so today. Perhaps it is that I now have my own daughter, and I'm thinking about what sort of husband she may choose? By the end of the movie, we are all rooting for Eliza. We want Higgins to get his comeuppance. We want him to be redeemed, to be improved, to see the light.But the last line of the movie doesn't meet our expectations: It is offensive and hurtful.Bottom line: The music is great, but the movie would be 100% better if the ending had Higgins making a sacrifice.",My Fair Lady

The uncaring father's Part too gets a bit too elongated and Boring.And with all that put aside this MOVIE is GREAT indeed The SONGS are also very good enjoyable The first two songs sung by the Professor and the Rag-girl are highly enjoyable.. The story is well handled The first half is a bit too longand the second half is filled with so many GREAT moments making it seem almost too short.The performances and the Chemistry between the TWO leading ACTORs is MagicalThis is Not a romantic Love Comedy. But it is a LOVE comedy Musical.The ending scene need no parsing It's a fantastic ending to a fantastic filmDID u Like Sound Of Music??? If yes then You might LOVES this one.9/10 Truly Magnificent Classic,My Fair Lady

223,rmsmythe,The most intelligent musical ever made,10,24 October 2005,"My Fair Lady is, as my summary states, the most intelligent musical ever made. Adapted by Lerner and Lowe from non-musical Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw, it is filled with clever, witty dialogue. Lavish sets, a superb cast, and wonderful songs make this film a masterpiece. Even sceptics of musicals (those who say they can't stand them because nobody bursts into song) will enjoy it.You can get the plot from the myriad of other reviews, so let me comment on what makes this musical such a treat for the mind, as well as the eye and ear.The intelligence comes from the satire of the British class society, the hilarious comments on morality from Doolittle, and the comments about the roles of the sexes in the ""songs"" of Henry Higgins. People (men, especially) will roar at his comments about women. Sure, they're stereotypes, incorrect generalizations. But do men think that way? Well, what do you think of his claim that: ""She will beg you for advice, your reply will be concise, she will listen very nicely and go out and do precisely what she wants!""Rex Harrison's Higgins is such an interesting character. Certainly he's insulting and insensitive. But what makes him fascinating is that he knows he is like that. ""The moment I make friends with a woman I become selfish and tyrannical,"" he says. Does he treat Eliza poorly? Certainly, but no more poorly than he treats anybody else, which is, therefore, giving her equality with everyone else despite her lower class origins.A wonderful, poignant scene occurs as Eliza returns, as a lady, to the streets before dawn, where the working class is setting up for the days market. In her earlier life, she would have been there, buying the flowers to sell to the upper classes. Now, as the people hum and whistle a song we heard her sing at the movie's start, she finds she can no longer fit in. ""This is no place for a lady, ma'am,"" a bloke says to her gently. So what has her ""education"" got her?The stage version of My Fair Lady held the record for most performances for a decade. The LP became the highest selling LP ever, of all genres, not just cast recordings.Please watch My Fair Lady, especially the restored DVD version. It's a true classic. You will see the character that Rex Harrison was born to play, and the character that Audrey Hepburn became. (Upon her death, Time Magazine remembered her with the photograph of her from My Fair Lady.) (Note: No review is complete without pointing out that true musical fans know that Julie Andrews, who played the role on Broadway, SHOULD have had the film version. Jack Warner wanted a bigger name. So Andrews became Mary Poppins, and accepted an Oscar for best actress with a thank you to Jack Warner for making it possible!)",My Fair Lady
224,elvis4all,The Perfect Film for Fans of Emotional Abuse and Threats of Physical Violence,5,17 November 2021,"Last night I was in the mood for a musical, so I turned back to a film I'd enjoyed in the past. While I always shuddered at Henry Higgins' derogatory and commanding final line (""Fetch my slippers"") which proved his character was less a male chanteuse who could string together some clever lyrics and rap-style rhyme, at heart he was an emotionally abusive and controlling narcissist with an inability to mature. Worse yet, I had forgotten the level of his ghastliness. In the first few minutes of the film when Eliza's in the streets selling flowers, Higgins ridicules her in front of her friends and treats her as if she's garbage. When she arrives at his home, he further degrades her by treating her like she's his property. He was the pimp and she was his hooker.Sure, I know times have changed since the early 1960s, but how did they not understand that when he very literally threatens to kill her, lock her in the basement, and have her beaten if she refuses to complete her lessons that it may not be a message women (or anyone who's not a cruel, manipulative, misogynist) would appreciate? Of course, beyond Higgins' abusive nature you'll also need to set aside the vast gaps in age, upbringing, culture, and education that would suggest it would be impossible for these two to ever form a healthy relationship -- much less any physical attraction from Eliza for a puffy senior citizen. While I have the ability to suspend disbelief, it's impossible to suspend the revulsion of Higgins' character. It's a film that doesn't age well. Twenty minutes in, the penny dropped and I dropped out.",My Fair Lady
225,fmarandabouchard,1 minute that brings the movie down,8,1 September 2019,"Overall, it is a delighful movie and really solid both acting-wise and technically. It had something to say, said it quite well for most of the movie (but we'll come back to that soon). The songs were quite catchy and did not fell in a lot of trap I was expecting them to. Obviously, some scenes did not age well (particularly the bath scene at the beggining which made me cringe quite a bit). However, I've grown to expect more of those in movies from that time. While it does not excuse it, it is worth considering that it is not 'of its time' but maybe slightly ahead of it, which is always appreciated. Some characters might have deserved some more development. Freddy is the most obvious example but Pickering never really project immense respect and the only reason I should believe that is because the movie tell me so, which is not a sign of great writing. However, this is only a small element which is easily forgive by the overall quality of the last hour or so.The movie was about to end like it should have. I remember telling myself ""Well, I was sure they were gonna fall in the trope of the girl ending up with the protagonist who does not deserve her, but I'm glad I'm wrong."" Then came a great last scene were Higgins listen to his recordings contemplating how his hubris made all those who are dare to him flee him, which was foreshadowed quite early with his mother. The image of him, looking into oblivion, while the real Eliza speaks of his worth in the background and how he decided unconciously that she was not worth him (her money was not worth nor was she, she was solely worth the challenge). Magnificent, 10/10, 9 if I feel severe.But then came that last minute that ruined a perfect ending. Having Eliza not only come back, but come back to Higgins acting as a he always had was just too much. I guess this is the moment where the movie was 'of its time', and that time does not make for good romantic drama.Overall, I cannot give the movie a bad grade. If, on a three hours movie, only one and an half scene are bad, you forgive it. Furthermore, next time I watch it, I know when to end it.",My Fair Lady
226,lawstudent007,Rex Rex,9,3 February 2003,"Rex Harrison is perfect.  What else can one say?  He does a great job.Audrey Hepburn also is fantastic.  She has the grace and dignity befitting a princess, but in the beginning she is convincing as a lower class ""gutter snipe"".  I think her performance was better than Julie Andrew in Mary Poppins(which won Andrews the Oscar over Hepburn) and I think she is likely also better than Andrews was in this role.The movie moves along nicely.  It isn't fast, but it is never slow.  The dialogue is witty (listen carefully.  Higgins uses wonderful language) the plot is fun.  It is ""loverly""!",My Fair Lady

232,corneliablondeau,Long and tedious,1,28 June 2020,"In my quest of watching every Oscar winning film, I have also watched this one and frankly I am disappointed. I mean it carried home 8 Oscars and yet only one of them was justified. Rex Harrison's performance is average at best, compared to what Sellers had to offer that year. It's a shame that we cannot mend the wrongs of the past in the present, because the Academy Awards of that year need to be be redone.",My Fair Lady
233,senninha70,I hate that I like this movie,8,15 July 2002,"When I was in middle school, I was in choir class.  When we had a substitute, we watched musicals.  I've seen them all.  ""Oklahoma"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Mary Poppins"" and ""My Fair Lady"".  Of these classics, the only one I actually remember and like 13 years later is ""My Fair Lady"".  I don't know if it's because I've seen it a dozen times or because Eliza is so pretty and likeable or because Henry's change before your very eyes is so dramatic.  Whatever the reason, I love this movie, and it's the only movie made before I was born that I particularly enjoy.",My Fair Lady
234,veranjank,"Arguably, the best musical of all time.",10,11 December 2002,"MY FAIR LADY (1964)""You don't argue with success"", so says the sleeve note of the original soundtrack recording of West Side Story. It is a relevant remark in the case of My Fair Lady too. I watched it for the n th time, and am sure that I would watch it again for the n+1 time also. What is the magic of My Fair Lady?Well, firstly, the music. It is brilliant. And the kind of ""speaking song"" that the Lerner-Loewe combination mastered even in Camelot, particularly suited the professor. Secondly, the way the relationship of professor and Eliza evolves, that is definitely based on a deep understanding and love for each other, but that never gets the word ""love"" out of any. Thirdly, the nostalgia that we, living in turbulent days, feel for those good old days. Not only the days portrayed in the film, but also the days of great musicals, the 50's and early 60's.The main criticism that was levelled against My Fair Lady was that it was theatrical. But on reflecting this issue, one realizes that the same theatricality effectively conveys the superficiality and the formality of the society that is depicted. This again increases the beauty of the Higgins-Eliza relationship.Way back in the sixties I thought it was the perfect film. In the seventies, I was afraid to see it again lest I should have out-grown the magic- and I was wrong. Now I am not afraid to see it again- because I am sure I will always love it. And arguably, it is the best musical of all time.",My Fair Lady
235,jojo_ismal,"It's a great musical, but the plot...",7,22 October 2010,"Not wanting to be a party pooper, overall, My Fair Lady is such a feast for a musical-lover like me. However, to the end, I believe that the movie itself will benefit itself more with few editing especially the 'Get Me to the Church on Time' number sung by Mr. Doolittle which I saw does not contribute at all to the storyline. As for the part in which Eliza poured her heart to Mr. Higgins, she told him that she's needed in the house to tell him where's his slippers, to do things for him, in which I couldn't identify at all the physical hardships that she faced in Higgin's house (except for mental stress due to the verbal abuse and the trainings). Sure do what I saw was that she got herself living in a wealthy lifestyle, with maids changing her to pajamas. i was lost for awhile during that scene, but maybe it's just me.The biggest credit for this movie is definitely the presence of Audrey Hepburn. Oh my, the differences she showed being the commoner and the faux, high class lady is just obvious and mesmerizing. She deserved every accolades coming in her way after the movie.",My Fair Lady

Sure, hypothesis of Julie Andrews as Eliza is present. But not for long time because Hepburn does a splendid work and the levels of metamorphose of poor young girl in a brilliant lady is credible and fascinating. Sure, the axis remains Rex Harrison and this fact is obvious. But , like in case of each good movie, the flavor after its end is essential.

Audrey Hepburn adds that simple charm, loving innocence, and firey will to Eliza that makes us draw to her and watch her glow.  With Rex Harrison as her just-as-headstrong match Professor Henry Higgins, the two are a delight to watch bicker, and a delight to watch while they grow to love each other. One of the finest of the popular period, and winning 8 Oscars, My Fair Lady is the fair lady of grand musicals.

And the storyline is even better, I have never seen the stage play but I'm sure it's just as good, maybe better! Towards the end however I was beginning to waver and started to think, 'How much longer?' it is a bit long at 2 hours and 45 minutes and there were some bits which could have been cut out for a bit shorter viewing. I suppose the intermission was to state it was really a play, but it wasn't that necessary I don't think. Anyway I gave this film a 6 and I recommend it to everyone who loves musicals.",My Fair Lady

But the acting is superb as well. The film just has this marvelously witty, warm, adult quality; this is no movie for small minds or the naive...there is a lot of social commentary, warring of the sexes, and one of the oddest yet most endearing 'love' stories around.

245,Darlie,Why I like My Fair Lady so much,10,16 May 2009,"I have seen this movie quite a few times already and not simply because of the great numbers by Loewe and Lerner. It has a lot to do with the dialogue by George Bernard Shaw which has such an interesting take on people - how you classify them and how you treat them. However, the most intriguing thing about this movie is always the cast and characters. Alfred Doolittle always cracks me up with his philosophy. Freddy is so innocent and pure and he has the best song of the movie. As for Eliza Doolittle, a lot has been said about how Julie Andrews was passed over by Jack Warner for this role. I am a big fan of Julie Andrews and I think it was really quite a poetic justice that she eventually won Oscar for Mary Poppins in the same year as MFL. However, how can you blame Jack Warner? Audrey Hepburn was a good choice for the film version. Especially when the transformation to a lady is complete at the embassy ball, there is no better actress than Audrey Hepburn to portray a ""Lady"" with class and elegance that can dance with a prince. As for Henry Higgins being played by Rex Harrison, this is one of those rare movie roles where it's so dominating and captivating that you just can't see any other actors who could have done this, much like Marlon Brando in Godfather. I recall one time someone offered me tickets for the stage production of My Fair Lady. I had no interest and turned it down because knowing that the Henry Higgins part would not be Rex Harrison. That told me how much Rex Harrison meant to me in that movie. So far I have only highlighted the things that specifically stand out. Actually everything else about the movie was also great.",My Fair Lady

It is a shame that Audrey Hepburn who was incredible {as always} in her role of Eliza Doolittle did not win the oscar instead of Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins. Her transformation from a miserable guttersnipe to a princess is truly a work of art and very deserving of the award.

It's an easy movie to watch with family and fall in love with.The actors, particularly Audrey Hepburn, were fantastic. I do not agree that Julie Andrews could've done the role better. Andrews is indeed also a very talented actress, and a better singer, but Hepburn was perfectly - and I mean PERFECTLY qualified for acting Eliza just as well, if not a bit better.Rex Harrison also played Henry Higgins wonderfully. His English was impeccable, and his character was entertaining. Some of his dialogues were offensive, but this was simply to portray how he evolved.The film did drag on a bit, due to having so many songs. After first watching it, I had a negative opinion because I felt the story wasn't very complex. However, when I went back and couldn't help but rewatch many of its amazing songs and scenes, I realized how magical it all was. The perfect mix of direction, drama and acting has made it one of the greatest films of all time.",My Fair Lady
256,emzy64,Quite entertaining at parts,7,6 January 2007,"I first watched this movie a few days ago for the first time. As I am a huge fan of great Hollywood musicals (e.g. The Sound of Music) I expected that I would fall in love with this movie immediately but I found that I had to watch it twice just to understand it properly. The ending of My Fair Lady confuses me and I find it to be very sudden as if I want it to continue to learn more.Some songs were great in the film and were very easy to get into and enjoy, such as ""wouldn't it be loverly"" and ""I could have danced all night"" but others were dull and have no point to them at all. At points in the film I want the storyline to hurry up a bit and stop all the songs just simply because they are so utterly boring. This film runs for almost 3 hours which I have nothing against except the fact that it must have a great storyline to keep it going and the audience captivated. In My Fair Lady I felt that some songs slowed down the storyline and without some of the songs the story would have flowed better and made the film shorter. I love the fact that there are songs in the movie (as I said before, I love musicals) but I don't like it when the songs exceed an amount when it just gets boring.Having said all of that, I believe that the acting in this movie is great, especially Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins. He won a best actor Oscar for this role and truly deserved it. I imagine Henry Higgins is a hard character to play and he did a good job.Although Julie Andrews really should have done the role of Eliza Doolittle, we can't change the past and I believe Audrey Hepburn did do quite a good job in the role. The only problem with the dubbing is that sometimes (especially in ""I could have danced all night"") it is not very well synchronized and looks fake. It is truly a shame that the role passed by Julie Andrews as she is a marvelous actor and one of the best singers I have ever heard. I feel that she could have made the film better because she knew the character of Eliza Doolittle a lot better than Audrey simply because of the time that she played her on Broadway and did a fantastic job at it might I add.The supporting cast, Stanley Holloway (Alfred P. Doolittle) who has a perfect accent for his character, Wilfred Hyde-White (Colonel Pickering), the lovely Gladys Cooper (Mrs. Higgins) and Jeremy Brett (Freddy Eynsford-Hill) all add something unique and special to My Fair Lady and help make the film a success.In conclusion, my opinion is that this movie is quite entertaining in parts and has a good storyline but sometimes the songs drag on and on. In general the acting is superb but I still prefer The Sound of Music to this film but I'm glad I saw it. I can understand why it has been such a huge success.Worth seeing if you are a fan of musicals like me.7/10 stars",My Fair Lady

259,jay-b-markson,An Excellent Movie Musical,10,7 January 2007,"""My Fair Lady"" has a couple of problems. For one, the pacing is gratingly slow, particularly in the last third of the film. For another, Audrey Hepburn's performance as Eliza Doolittle is only so-so. (Sorry, Hepburn fans.) While she obviously brings a lot of talent to the role, her Cockney accent is poor and she overacts her songs.Despite these issues, ""My Fair Lady"" is one of the very best movie musicals of all time. The songs are witty, engaging, and sometimes beautiful; the script is clever and pointed (thanks to Shaw); and Rex Harrison is gleefully abrasive and disdainful as Henry Higgins. This movie would be worth watching just for Harrison, but also features strong supporting performances, particularly from Stanley Holloway as Eliza's father.What sets ""My Fair Lady"" apart most is its relative lack of Broadway sappiness. There are no too-pat love stories, nor embarrassing melodrama; instead, the film explores bachelorhood, social classism, stubbornness, and the complexity of human relationships. The characters and circumstances feel genuine. The result is a rare movie that is satisfying both intellectually and emotionally. ""My Fair Lady"" is also brave enough to have an ambiguous ending, one of only three movie musicals I know to do so. (The others are ""West Side Story"" and ""Fiddler on the Roof."") ""My Fair Lady"" lacks the glitz of many movie musicals, but is truer, more thoughtful, and ultimately better than, for example, ""The Sound of Music."" (Sorry, SoM fans. ""The Sound of Music"" makes me gag.) It even compares favorably to the gold standard of movie musicals: ""Singin' in the Rain."" ""Singin'"" is wildly entertaining, features brilliant choreography, and is more tightly paced. But, having seen both movies, I find that ""My Fair Lady"" makes for better memories.See it.",My Fair Lady
260,itchymcguirk-1,Technicolor deluxe,9,13 April 2007,"Everything about this film speaks talent. Even though that the real singer was so left out. She knew it. And Hepburn is about the only great star diva one ego who was not the leading motivation for denying a great voice her just due. The technicolor is so rich and so 60's and unforgettable for the 60's version of movies. We should be mindful that great stories played out in so rich ways can not be captured and shared on TV and small screens. We will either save big screens as we can collectively or we will all have our own vivid screens in our living rooms, losing a common ground. This is our last opportunity. We all hear this every day but when I see that there is no passion for the loss of the Metro here in SF, I think I must be either crazy or the whole world has lost every sense of culture. Do we really need another drugstore? Or even another great Borders? What I have come to realize is that the same people I admire for their love of movies hate the idea that there may be another big theater to compete with. Where is G. Lucas? He can build bricks in the Presidio and yet not see that the Metro can be a bridge for all that has shined before and will be revealed and shared again?",My Fair Lady

265,poochki23,Wonderful!,10,3 May 2004,"My Fair Lady is truly one of the most wonderful musicals in the history of film. It completely deserves to be on AFI's list. The magnitude of this film was truly one of kind though not surprising considering George Cukor as the director (Gone with the Wind). His films were generally of epic grandeur and that's part of the charm. This movie may not have the special effects that movies have today, i.e. The Matrix, etc. but the charm of the movie is incomparible. It truly is a legend in it's own right. To take a Broadway musical, based on Pygmalion, and turn it into a movie takes hard work and is generally unprecedented. It truly takes genius. The sets (London in the 19th century), the costumes (gorgeous), and the characters are phenomenal. Rex Harrison plays a very convincing professor Henry Higgins. And Audrey Hepburn is stunning as well as charming. Her transformation from a common flower girl into a lady is, at times, breathtaking. This movie deserved it's 8 Oscars!! It's a winner!",My Fair Lady
266,normanb-51005,This film is ok,6,27 June 2020,"Compared to its competition at Oscars, i.e. Dr Strangelove by Kubrick, this film is only ok. Rex Harrison, despite being quite good in this one, didn't deserve the Oscar above Sellers.",My Fair Lady

269,Boland,Sir Rex Harrison has no peer!,10,21 June 2002,"Has there ever been an actor as completely watcxhable as the wonderful Sir Rex Harrison? His performance in my Fair Lady will always bee onee of the all time greats! As with Gable in ""Gone With The Wind"", Yul Brynner in ""King and I' and Brando and Leigh in ""Streetcar, Harrison's Henry Higgins is a legend. He brings such a quality to the role making you sympatise,while also making you say ""What an arrogant S.O.B.!""He won a well deserved Oscar for the film against some stiff competition including Burton and O'Toole in ""Becket"". The rest of the cast is nothing to sneeze at either. The great Stanley Hollowy and the ever watchable Wilfred Hyde White lending ever enjoyable support along with Gladys Cooper as Higgin's long suffering Mother. Hepburn could have been better,but why complain.She is good enough for the role,and besides...its Sir Rex's film anyway.

271,lbretz,One of my all-time favorites,10,9 January 2003,"Lerner and Loewe's classy and witty songs make this the perfect musical. Rex Harrison, is, as always, fabulous recreating his broadway role.

272,lengoforth,Excellence!,10,4 March 2003,"This movie is a delight! From start to finish, the cast, the sets, the costumes, the music, the direction of George Cukor, and the story all make for an excellent movie. This is first rate entertainment, done with sytle and great attention to detail.  From the outset, the movie, especially the cast, weaves an enchanting spell - one fit for youngsters of all ages. But as the story unfolds, the viewer find that there is serious material and a lesson in this story. . The movie questions our values of class, gender, love, roles in relationships, and self worth. All this is put to the wonderful music of Lerner and Lowe, and superb performances by the cast. Rex Harrison, Stanley Holloway and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the very essence of their characters.  Miss Hepburn's performance seems strained at times, but this is easily overlooked by perfection in almost everything, including costumes, lighting, and set direction. Yet, for all the character's and overall charm of this movie, you'll find yourself questioning your values at the end of it, and find that the answer is delivered with love, in a most beguiling story set in an enchanted setting. Don't miss this one!",My Fair Lady
273,eliza-doolittle,A musical with a brain as well as a heart,10,28 August 2003,"There's a lot of negative things been said about Audrey Hepburn's interpretation of the role of Eliza. Perhaps she's not ideal in the earliest scenes of the movie - her ""dirtiness"" is never quite believable - but it has to be said that despite this smallish drawback she still glows, and makes an amazing Eliza overall.The reason for this is simple; Audrey Hepburn brings her ""own spark of divine fire"", (to quote Higgins) to the role and her vulnerability, mixed with her sweet, naive charm and even her wonderfully juvenile pettishness shown in ""Just You Wait"" all prove what a talented actress she really is. For an example of this, just watch Eliza's facial expression at Ascot, when she realises her opportunity to demonstrate her new-found mastery of the English tongue - sweetly hilarious.MFL has been criticized as being too romanticized, too overblown. I disagree; musicals are suposed to be lavish affairs, and none pull it off quite so well as ""My Fair Lady"" does. It's a momentous film but it has its subtle points: watch the way in which Eliza's eyes are centred on Higgins when she enters at the ball, and the way in which the two of them stare at each other for a few seconds at the top of the stairs a few moments later.
It musn't be overlooked that, thanks to its being based on a Bernard Shaw play, ""My Fair Lady"" has what the great majority of musicals lack: a deeper meaning and something really quite profound to say.The actor in the role of Colonel Pickering is a little weak, but it must be said that Rex Harrison IS Henry Higgins. In a lot of ways (in fact, in most ways) Higgins has an objectionable personality: rude, snobbish, impatient and even misogynistic, but somehow Rex Harrison pulls it all off and makes us like Higgins without betraying the character. As to romance, his song ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"" is an ode to the kind of love which sneaks up on you. Overall, this movie is romantic, but not too sentimental. It has just enough romance to be dramatically fulfilling, but it never becomes soppy or mawkish. The word ""love"" is never mentioned at all and the two leads never even kiss. The famous end sequence is perfect and does the movie justice; after all, a big happy bow tied around a perfect romance at the end would simply not fit with everything we have learned about the two protagonists.",My Fair Lady
274,cayser-tseo,Could somehow be better,7,16 July 2012,"Audrey Hepburn is simply stunning in this movie - as in most. Only drag is that she did not actually sing her songs in the movie. Also, the poor quality of the majority of songs is quite disappointing.The story is just superb, though. But who is to thank for that?Anyways, I give it a 7/10 because of the very solid overall cast, some quite remembering songs - by far the most outstanding of them being ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" -, the thought out lead characters (but actually only them, since the supporting roles were rather shallow. At least the part of Pickering could be exhausted in a more interesting way, although it is hinted at at the end of the movie).",My Fair Lady
275,Randomly_mental,A great must-see film!,10,22 January 2005,"I reckon this is a must see for every person of any age, even those who don't generally enjoy musicals. It is hilariously entertaining and enjoyable to watch again and again. Audrey Hepburn is a great actress and portrays Eliza Dolittle in a unique way. There is a variety of different characters, all very likable in their own ways. After watching the film, I found I could understand comedies that used the storyline, such as in Family Guy, when the Drunken Clam burns down and we meet Nigel and Eliza Pinchley, and in The Simpsons when Sideshow Bob sings 'Accustomed to (his) face'. The songs are very catchy, I found myself singing them and quoting lines from the film. If performing a theatre or play version of My Fair Lady I advise that the film is seen before. I personally don't think I will ever get bored of watching the spectacular acting and singing skills.",My Fair Lady
276,robertbarncord,"Eliza is the protagonist, not Henry",10,4 May 2016,"The actual plot is that Eliza HIRES Higgins after hearing him boast that with his speech training alone, she could become a ""proper lady"". He accepts, treating it as a challenge, and in the beginning they develop a dislike for each other as they stubbornly continue the training program. Here is one element that lifts this story to the level of greatness - not only the man-woman conflict arises, but the upper-lower class contrast is explored, as it existed in Edwardian England. That is the one element that remains from Shaw's original play. Higgins is a confirmed bachelor and Eliza only wants to improve herself; but they insensibly come to have respect for each other, and a strange sort of interdependence develops. And she is NEVER subservient to him, and holds her own and stands her ground. Not many films give such respect to the female character, allowing her to be equal and even dominant - though the man doesn't realize it.I strongly urge any newcomer to this film to listen carefully to the words of the songs - Shakespeare named his man-woman duel/romance ""Taming of the Shrew""; My Fair Lady could be called ""Taming of the Chauvinist"" - and it is well expressed in each musical number. The music evolves right along with the story. And the music - well, it was the first Broadway album to sell a million copies, and was #1 on the Billboard Chart for 15 weeks!! In summary, Eliza, as I say, is the protagonist, and she exerts as profound a change in Higgins as he does in her. The barriers of both class and sex are breached, and never was the egalitarian tale told with such honesty and art.",My Fair Lady
277,southern2537,excellent movie,10,24 November 2005,"Its a shame that movies of this caliber are not made any longer. The casting was perfect. I was completely surprised that Ms. Hepburn didn't do all of the singing. But that didn't matter. I guess I have watched a hundred times. The pictures of gowns and other attire was also fantastic. The only other movie that could come close to the gowns was ""Gigi"". You probably can't answer all requests but I was wondering what other movies were done by the writers as well. Also what year was the movie portraying. I saw telephones and electrical lights and wish I had some of the glorious antiques. Also can you tell me where I can read more about the making of the picture and how all the actors liked it. While on stage did Rex Harrison act in it.

This movie is beautiful to look at: the set, costumes, & choreo are all very nice. The issue is the characters: not a single one is interesting, nor ever garnered any of my empathy. - and I'm very easy to please! Higgins is simply a raging misogynist, through and through, and never learns a single lesson. Hard to watch at times for how utterly insufferable he was. Also I could only bear how obnoxious Eliza was because Audrey is so delightful to watch. There were moments of charm, but for the most part she made my eyes glaze over. Additionally, this movie could cover the same ground and be less horrible if it was half the length. This film is the textbook example for aging badly.",My Fair Lady

I didn't know why Tom Cruise mentioned in Jerry McGuire ""That's not a dress, it's an Audrey Hepburn movie"".  Now I realize how that has to be one of the best one-liners ever in a movie. You cannot help but fall in love with the downtrodden persona of Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) when paired opposite Prof Higgins (Harrison), a snobby, wealthy chap set on winning a minial bet at the cost of rendering Mrs. Doolittle to a mere object or pawn in a game. The songs, unfortunately, are seldom performed in Audrey's voice.  Audrey does, however, put all her kinetic energy in dance, conniptions and pride (eat your heart out Julie Andrews) during the musical numbers. Ok, listen carefully: they don't make these types of hilariously innocent-minded comedies these days.  And if they did, they wouldn't work. Take the example of the Sabrina remake.  excellent movie, but pales in comparison to the original.",My Fair Lady

284,thruppfamily,An Enjoyable Story!,9,10 June 2006,"I brought the movie 'My Fair Lady' and I loved it!! It is a great movie for everyone to see of all ages.The movie itself is about a poor flower girl who lives on the street. A professor sees her and his friend makes a bet with him that he will turn her into a proper lady in 6 months and he would Pay for all expense. So Eliza moves in with them and begins her lessons. She learns how to walk, talk and dress like a Lady. However she finds herself falling in love with Professer Higgans. When the six months is up, she runs away thinking that Higgans doesn't care about her at all since hes won his bet. In the end, she returns to him.I think the only thing lacking in the other wise 10 star story is a proper ending. The last part of this movie is the only part that needs a bit more. I think that it would've been better if they had Eliza and Professer Higgans Marrige. I also thought it needed more romance. The most romantic part of the story is when They dance together at the ball.Still, the movie is a great watch for anyone, with the perfect music and wardrobe. I think it is a great Movie for anyone.

286,cgnogn_09,My Fair Lady,10,5 November 2006,"first saw this film when I was nine years old, after receiving it as a birthday present from my mother. For months I watched the movie on an almost daily basis, and, to everyone's surprise, surpassed ""The Sound of Music"" as my favorite movie (that was my daily movie when I was eight, lol). To this day I watch this movie more frequently than any other. Now that I am a bit older.. I notice that is does have quite a few flaws. It doesn't really capture the essence of Shaw's Pygmalion, but I don't think that should really take away from the movie; they should be treated as separate entities. Some of the sets are a little, well, cramped, but consider what they had to work with, they did a pretty good job. And then there is the dubbing issue. I recently special on MFL on AMC, and they showed ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"" and ""Show Me"" with Audrey's voice, and though Audrey may not have the perfect melodic voice of Marni Nixon, her voice was much more ""Eliza"". I really do think they should have just used her voice. If you watch ""Funny Face"", you get a good feel for voice, which I think is beautiful in a unconventional way. Then, there is the question of whether Julie Andrews should have played Eliza in the film version of MFL. I've gone back and forth on this issue. Now, Audrey Hepburn is my favorite actress of all time, and Julie Andrews my second favorite, so it really is hard to ""choose"". Of course Julie's voice is much better than even Marni Nixon's... but like I said before, I don't think a perfect singing voice really would suit Eliza. And as for which would play a better Eliza overall.. I really don't know. I wasn't alive to see MFL on Broadway, so I really can't compare the two. What I do know is that Audrey gave an amazing performance. I really can't imagine Julie's instead of Audrey's face gazing into space right before ""I could have danced all night"". Anyway, as someone else said, if Julie had played Eliza, who would have played Mary Poppins? Not having Julie as Mary Poppins would be a MUCH greater tragedy than never seeing what sort of Eliza she would make on film.",My Fair Lady

I grew up watching My Fair Lady and enjoyed it first through song. Now, I appreciate it for its history, creativity, and design. This movie really leaves an impression on the viewer towards the conclusion of the film. Cukor allows the audience to question Eliza and Higgins' thoughts and feelings throughout the entire movie; are they in love? or are they just a test for one another?

Performance of actors and actresses were perfect. In the movie, her success in becoming a lady is so effectively in terms that it shows us that if you want to do anything or have any feature and if you work enough and be passionate to receive what you want, you will receive. Although I was a bit bored, it was a pleasure to watch this movie and grab the messages to apply on my life. I cannot say I totally advice this movie; however, the old is like the gold.

Photography excellent and better then modern day pictures with equipment of 1963 quite an achievement. Best thing about this picture is continuity, subject matter grabs the audience attention without using visual effects, as is common in modern day pictures. One can only say this picture is a milestone in movie making and probably will not be repeated, and is a model in the forgotten art of making film musicals on a budget. Noted also acting abilities also of a higher standard of most actors today, quite evident in the performances. The more you watch this picture the more you will want to see it. It is to movie making what a Beethoven symphony is to music. Also noted that an audio cd is available of the original Broadway production with Julie Andrews (when she was 21), recorded nine days after the stage production began on March 24th 1956.

298,ahmedlimam-884-276782,Excellent movie but disappointing performance by Audrey Hepburn,8,5 January 2014,"I love ""My Fair Lady"", it is one of my favorite movies. Everything in it is great: the direction, witty dialogues, terrific songs, sets and costumes, except for one thing: Audrey Hepburn's performance. Even in rags and dirty, she just isn't credible as a Cockney. And once she becomes a lady, which of course she plays better since she has that innate elegance, there just isn't anything especial about it, she just reads her lines and ""sings"" the songs. One exception is the scene where she ""sings"" ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" where she was luminous. What a pity she doesn't display the same type of inspiration in her other scenes. And we'll never know what Julie Andrews would have looked like had she been chosen to reprise her Broadway role.Speaking of acting, Stanley Holloway's show-stealing performance is something to enjoy repeatedly. It seems incredible that he lost the Academy Award to Peter Ustinov (a usually terrific actor) for his role in ""Topkapi.""

299,nancy-161,An excellent and informing review! Read it!,10,1 September 2005,"""My Fair Lady"" is about a young woman in London in the early 1900s. She sells flowers in the streets, dresses very shabbily, and talks with a horrible cockney accent. (Eliza Doolittle, played in the movie by Audrey Hepburn, but when it first came out on Broadway, it was played by Julie Andrews- Julie was Maria in The Sound of Music and the Queen in The Princess Diaries.) One evening, after a ball, a professor of English, Henry Higgins, hears her talking and (after singing one of the many songs about how ""The French speak French, the Greek are taught their Greek, so why can't the English learn to speak?"") wagers with his friend that he can pass her off as a lady in a florist shop, or a Duchess at the Embassey ball, by teaching her to speak proper British. Henry Higgins is played by Rex Harrison, who starred in the first movie version of Dr. Doolittle. So Higgins takes her into his home and dresses her properly and tries to teach her a good accent. It's very funny, for some of the many things in the movie: before the ball, they take Eliza to the Ascot races, and although she speaks with a faked proper accent, she has terrible grammar, and she says things like how after her Aunt died -from too much rum- someone ""pinched"" her new straw hat that was to have been willed to her- and all of Professor Higgins's friends think her conversation is perfectly charming and the latest fashion, Higgins is mortified, of course. And then, in the middle of the race, everyone is perfectly quiet and elegant watching the horses, and no one says a word. Except for Eliza, who shouts out, ""come on, Dover, move your blooming a*r*s*e !"" and then some of the fine ladies faint. :) They take her to the ball in the most stunning dress ever, she doesn't do anything wrong at all, the Queen stops in the middle of the procession down the hall to tell her she's perfectly charming, and the prince dances with her!!! He's so handsome! :) When they come home after the ball, she starts crying because she realizes -what is she going to do now? She can't live with Henry Higgins once her training is complete, think how the neighbors would gossip! :) And she can't work in a ""florist shop"" as Higgins said at first now, because she has become so fine and people would recognize her- although it is more respectable to work in a fine florist shop than to sell flower bunches in the street, it is a position less than a lady who doesn't have to work and goes to balls with princes. But it has a happy ending- although not said, it is intimated at the very last, despite Higgins singing two songs about how terrible and unorganized women are, and how he would never marry, that they get married and live happily ever after. The End. :) It's a lovely cute movie, it's happy, and has some of the most famous songs in it. Here's some clips of it, listen to them!http://www.amazon.com/exec /obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002 AW2/qid=1125605575/sr=2-1/r ef=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-4008246-2626449?v=glance&s=musicYou'll like them, and it will make you want to watch the movie.",My Fair Lady
300,terminatordaniel,"Annoying, Terrible Hepburn",5,23 March 2015,"A 2h50mins long movie with a message our Singapore government loves to propagate ---- ""Speak good English"", personally I don't fancy musicals like this which is so exaggerated, but can't deny that the British elegance in the film's great. A modern Cinderella film, another movie that proved the success formula of adapting a classic tale with modern touch(just like A.I. Artificial Intelligence is robot version of Pinoccho), inspirational to bad English speakers, has a few good songs,old-school elegance, the last scene including the last line by Mr.Higgins pretending to act normally with his hat covering his face was classic, nothing else is good beside these. Here comes the negative reviews: Audrey Hepburn was so annoying and ungrateful, as annoying as how she was in Breakfast At Tiffany's.Some people criticize this film for the misogyny? Haha if every woman act like Hepburn in this movie, I hope there'll be more misogyny----Mr. Higgins taught her well and gave her such a great English education without charging any fees, provided her free housing, free food(including chocolates everyday), free clothes, took her to high-class place, why the f**k is she throwing tantrums? Yes maybe the professor was only caring about his bet instead of Hepburn's feeling,but so what? Did the professor owe her anything? Did he have any social responsibility for her? Yes Mr. Higgins trained her in a very harsh manners but did he rest while training her? Wasn't the reason that Hepburn came to Mr. Higgins' house for a proper English oral education and he perfectly accomplished the mission with extra benefits provided? What more should she ask for? Another character in a movie that gives me the strong urge to punch her in the face. Her father was really stupidly annoying as well. I feel very emotionally connected with Mr. Higgins, he's a typical man who just wants women to think with logic, yet he's misunderstood as being unkind to Hepburn. Thank god the ending didn't make me despise Hepburn even more. In the end, the movie's also too unnecessarily long, 5.4/10. I've watched 566 movies and this is the 1st time I felt the strong desire to write a review on IMDb. Reasons being: 1, Though not one of the worst movies I've seen, this movie is too overrated, definitely do not deserve so many Oscar awards. 2, Hepburn is not lovely in this movie at all. A woman has to make sense while she's speaking. Everyone has feelings but make sure you process it with logical thinking before venting them out.Or do not blame Mr. Higgins for his misogyny. I'll be like him too under his situation. 3, I wanna justify for Marilyn Monroe since some people complain why Audrey Hepburn is less discussed about comparing to Marilyn Monroe, when Hepburn is also a much nicer person in real life. Look, as a movie watcher, I don't give a fish about how nice you are in real life, I only care about your screen performance. Marilyn Monroe is 10 times more lovely, glamorous and sexier than Hepburn. I don't care if Hepburn's as holy as a priest.",My Fair Lady
301,dlscally-1,Technical Error in Movie - Also Information Request,10,18 December 2006,"It seems a shame to point out a technical error in such a great movie. However, I have seen many tapes of races from Ascot Race Course and I can certify that at Ascot the races are run Clockwise, on what the British call a ""Right Handed Course"". In the movie's scene at Ascot Race Course, the horses are obviously running Counterclockwise, on what the British call a ""Left Handed Course"". To the best of my knowledge, the only times that horses actually run Counterclockwise at Ascot are while warming up before a race and while returning to be unsaddled.On another matter: Whoever is dubbed in as the singer for Jeremy Britt's ""On the street where you live"" is a very well trained tenor. So far I have been unable to find out who the artist is. Can anyone help me?",My Fair Lady
302,wildcatmel02,"I adore this film, forever.",10,24 March 2008,"I've noticed in reading the reviews already posted that most people want to debate the casting of the film, and that's fine. Others want to debate whether or not George Bernard Shaw would be angry at the ending (which he actually did pen for the 1930s version of Pygmalion.) That's all fine.But here is my honest opinion of the film, and it's romantic plot line. First of all, it's beautiful. The scenery, the costumes, and the music. But the ambiguity of the Higgins/Eliza ""sort of romance"" has always been one of my favorite things about this film. Why? Because the one thing good ol' George Bernard Shaw got right about this script (be it his original theatrical ending or the film ending) is that it shows us the different types of love between men and women. Not all love is Eros and passionate. It is more subtle. At the age of 10, I found this ending incredibly frustrating. Now as I approach my mid-twenties, I find it real and heartfelt. Perhaps, Higgins and Eliza remain platonic. Or, maybe Higgins and Eliza decide to marry? Maybe she does run off and marry Freddy. This sort of thing is best decided by the individual. But one thing is certain, they are most wonderfully in love, be it conventional or unconventional.And that's just loverly.",My Fair Lady
303,anamorais87,A loverly flower girl and her arrogant professor,9,13 August 2005,"I really like this movie since it has a little bit of everything on it. It has comedy, romance, drama, music and also a bit of dancing. The only thing you probably guess it's missing is adventure, but it also has some of it: the adventure is trying to do a complete makeover in all aspects in order to change a poor flower girl into a high society lady. It's just a wonderful movie that you can enjoy by seeing it alone or with someone you like. It's amazing to see the changes suffered by the flower girl and how her relations with the surrounding people starts to change due to the growth of this character's person and personality. It's like if this character was sculpted by the professor, so that she could be a complete person. So, if you really like musicals as much as I do, you should see this movie.",My Fair Lady

305,NKidmanFan21,I Luv this Movie! But there was 1 bad thing!,9,24 September 2005,"Well I got My Fair Lady a few months ago, and I loved it! I love the colors, the acting, and everything! The one thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't use Audrey Hepburn's actual voice. This I think was one of the reasons she didn't win/or was nominated for the Best ActressIn A Leading Role. It was cute, funny, and I loved the music. The songs were very good too. Actually The men that plays Henry Higgans and Alffie Dolittle(Eliza's Father)were the two men who brought the characters to life in the play on Broadway, except the play had Julie Andrews as Eliza. As I said, the movie was very good, and I do advise you to see it if you ever get the chance.Overall it was an excellent movie.",My Fair Lady
306,rechtco,1938 Pygmalion,7,10 April 2021,"My Fair Lady is based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion. The 1964 musical is almost an exact copy of the 1938 UK non-musical movie version of Pygmalion with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller. The 1938 movie won an Oscar for Best Screenplay (written by Shaw) and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress. The 1938 movie without the music is more enjoyable, had much better acting than the later musical and is a much better rendering of Shaw's play. Both movies have very similar endings and Shaw changed the ending in the printed version of his play to match the more audience pleasing modified movie ending.",My Fair Lady
307,shanote,How I like this movie,10,27 November 2005,"Absolutely, a splendid movie...a classic in the making which can never be remade. A rare Cinema that showcases the brilliance of it's actors, characters, music and dialogue. No wonder, it won the Greatest Oscar! And it is one of the only movies that I credit to win that prestigious honor. A must watch, in every sense of art and finery! Professor Higgins, that evil little imp who has such an ego that would belittle mountains in a matter of words, played charismatically by Rex Harrison and the supporting characters including Eliza's Father are such a charm, nothing out of place...with a little bit of luck. And yes, I beg to differ with those who think Higgins didn't deserve Eliza at the end, I think as he came to realize that Eliza meant more to him than a Soddy old piece of cabbage, he respected her and cared for her in his own unique way. The last song in the movie clearly depicts what he felt for her. And I believe that every person who loves somebody would want that loved one to be cared for and never to leave him or her. Thus, Higgins too must have realized how foolish he was to treat the lovely Eliza in such a crude manner and he is mature enough not to do so again but only to tease her.",My Fair Lady
308,ajrosen,Just had a dream about how angry I was about this movie,4,14 November 2017,Julie Andrews was my first love - at 3 years old I had worn out 3 records of My Fair Lady playing it over and over again - Years latter I found out that my mother used to sing to me in her womb and I was trying to find her again threw Julie's voice. I was adopted. At 8 years old my grandmother took me too see My Fair Lady in the theater with Julie Andrews - Rex Harrison - Stanly Holloway - Wow.No one compares too Julie Andrews in this roll - Audrey Hepburn totally wrong for the roll. Don't know why this film got 8 academy awards. The only thing good about it were the costumes. Camera work was insensitive too the music although beautiful but sterile. Direction was terrible nothing was believable or fun. They should have waited 2 years for Julie to finish Sound of Music and Marry Poppins and got a different director and then we would have 3 classics. A disappointment and Crying Shame. Total waist of money.,My Fair Lady
