0,SnoopyStyle,return of the fun rom-com,7,30 June 2018,"Harper (Zoey Deutch) and Charlie (Glen Powell) are overworked assistants under tyrannical bosses in the same Manhattan office building. Harper's boss Kirsten Stevens (Lucy Liu) is a hard hitting ESPN reporter. Charlie's boss Rick (Taye Diggs) is pissed over his difficult divorce. Harper and Charlie have a meet cute over a lunch order for their bosses. In order to save their personal lives, they decide to parent-trap their bosses and distract them from working so hard.This is a fun rom-com. I love that Harper and Charlie are also trying to dissect rom-coms when parent-trapping their bosses. Creepy Tim is hilarious. Deutch and Powell make for a fun couple non-couple. They have great chemistry that could go either way. I might get rid of the girlfriend a beat earlier. It would probably heat up their relationship a little faster. P.S. She should write about people she knows at Yankees Stadium instead of the geriatric Olympians.After hearing a couple of good reviews, I figured I needed to check this out. With theatrical rom-coms dying off, one does wonder if there are survivors in a hidden oasis. I don't know if Netflix is that oasis since the good ones seem to be the exceptions. Nevertheless, it's nice to see a good one. I've never heard of the director or the writer. This is not going to win any Oscars but it is a return to good rom-coms. There are some good laughs and endearing characters.",Set It Up
1,kosmasp,Setting up to upset?,7,31 March 2021,"Considering how some bosses react to being manipulated ... actually most are not really into the idea of being manipulated. Of course there are exceptions as always. But the movie is not so much about giving you a real reality. It gives you the romantic yet silly version of something. In building up its own tone, it should be clear where this is heading and how it tries to make you smile.Having said all that, you'll buy into it or be annoyed by it (see my first point). Hopefully you can have fun and can be relaxed about most things happening here. A lot of coincidences, a lot of mishaps and other things that can be considered funny because this is a movie and not reality ... I trust you can make that distinction. I had fun and the charisma of the leads (especially Zooey - I'm sure many know what I mean, she shines through in so many ways) elevates this above other similar themed movies.",Set It Up

3,Wizard-8,Not too funny rom-com,4,8 July 2018,"I feel I should first admit that romantic comedies are usually not my cup of tea. The reason why I sat down to watch this particular one was that it had Lucy Liu in the cast, and she is in my favorite television show, ""Elementary"". Liu is pretty good in this movie, making her character a believably hard and demanding boss while at the same time not going overboard so much to make her come across as hateful and unlikable. The other thing about the movie I appreciated was that the ending of the movie doesn't quite end up wrapping everything up in a way that you may be expecting. But apart from those two things, I didn't particularly enjoy the movie. The two young leads in the movie are too jokey and broad in their performances, enough so that they come across as annoying simpletons. The story is also thin in a number of aspects, and it's made worse by a running time (105 minutes) that is too long for its own good. Also, apart from a few mild chuckles, the movie simply isn't all that funny, with its humor being very predictable and familiar. In the end, you'll probably be saying ""Turn it off!"" to ""Set It Up"" long before its end credits start to roll.",Set It Up
4,Hellmant,Completely predictable and uninspiring (from a filmmaker's point of view at least). It is cute though.,6,29 June 2018,"'SET IT UP': Three Stars (Out of Five)A romantic comedy about a pair of underpaid and overworked assistants, that try to hookup their bosses together in order to lighten their workloads. The movie stars Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs. It was directed by Claire Scanlon, and it was written by Katie Silberman (two debut feature filmmakers). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. It reminded me a lot of a made for TV rocom. It's definitely not horrible, but it's also definitely not that good either. Harper (Deutch) works for Kirsten (Liu), and Charlie (Powell) works for Rick (Diggs). They're both highly abused, and underpaid assistants. So when the two meet, they hatch a plan to get their bosses to fall for each other; hoping that it will make them happier and much easier to work for. The two then of course start to develop feelings for each other as well. The movie is sweet, and the two lead characters are really likeable. Both Deutch and Powell are really charming in their roles as well. Diggs and Liu both make really nasty mean bosses too; I think Lucy Liu always makes one of the best dominatrices in film as well (like especially in 'PAYBACK'). Still, the movie is completely predictable and uninspiring (from a filmmaker's point of view at least). It is cute though, I'll admit.",Set It Up
5,ThomasDrufke,And Yet....,8,12 July 2018,"When I heard there was a solid Netflix original rom-com film coming out I had a few thoughts. One, Netflix makes good original films? Because from what I've seen, they tend to do a whole lot better on the television side of things. And the second thing I thought of was the severe lack of great romantic comedies there are in this age of film. So when I hear of a good one, I try and jump on it as soon as possible. Set It Up follows some rom-com cliches, but makes them their own by creating a freshly original plot inside an office building. The ""set it up"" part of the film feels like something you've seen a thousand times, but the combination of Zoey Deutch's irresistible charm and Glen Powell's breakout comedically, Set It Up is easily one of the most thoroughly enjoyable films of 2018. It takes 30 minutes before the film picks up comedically and dramatically, but once it does I found myself laughing out loud more than once. It's an easy 100 minute watch that neither demands too much from an audience but also doesn't dumb anything down. Admittedly, they succeed more in making you laugh than cry, but I will always be down to watch actors display great chemistry in any setting, but it especially impresses romantically.8.0/10",Set It Up
6,Bored_Dragon,Mediocre,5,13 July 2018,"Linear, predictable, totally unoriginal romantic comedy, full of clichés. Pluses are decent acting and nice chemistry among the main actors. If you decide to watch it, you will not be bored, if you skip it, you will not miss anything.5/10",Set It Up
7,Thanos_Alfie,Funny movie and nothing more...,5,31 October 2018,"""Set It Up"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch two corporate executive assistants trying to plan for their bosses to fall in love with each other. Their goal is very hard since both bosses are mainly working instead of living their lives. Although their primary goal is to plan for their bosses to fall in love with each other, their second and more important goal is to have more free time for their lives in order to do whatever they want and of course to be promoted in a higher position and work in their actual field of studies instead of being assistants of them.Since I had low expectations from this movie I was not let down by it and I was not happily or sadly surprised. The plot was decent for this kind of movie, no plot holes but also not any plot twists, an average written script with some good interpretations. I liked the interpretation of Glen Powell who played as Charlie and I also found interesting the interpretation of Taye Diggs who played as Rick, Charlie's boss. I have to say that the interpretation of Zoey Deutch who played as Harper was average and uninterested. I also expected more from Lucy Liu but I believe that she did not reach her potential. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Pete Davidson's who played as Mike, Charlie's flatmate, and he was simply hilarious. The direction which was made by Claire Scanlon was an average one with some good scenes but with many clichés.Finally, I believe that ""Set It Up"" is not a bad movie to watch, it's just an average movie to spend your time with. If you don't have high hopes for this movie then you won't be disappointed by it. It's not a boring movie, it has some good scenes but don't expect much from it.",Set It Up
8,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,5,29 July 2018,"Set It Up is a nice comedy and it provides some entertaining moments, though you can easily see where things are going.

9,matthewssilverhammer,Like a Really Good Sitcom Episode,7,10 August 2018,"With the right cast and a good script, even the most formulaic of movies can work, especially when they're as funny as Set It Off. A screwball / comedy-of-errors screenplay with the skin of a turn-of-the-millennium rom-com, it's a Pixy Stix of a movie: fun and colorful, with a sweetness so pure and predictable it's almost comfy. By the third act, the formula gets a bit grating, but it's still an unexpectedly good time.",Set It Up

11,dar0417,Not what you would expect,7,20 June 2019,Fun rom-com with a little a little twist. You expect a normal boy meets girl and so on film but you get something a little different. Not to different that this film is very predictable.,Set It Up

15,kjproulx,A Harmless Rom-Com,7,19 June 2018,"Romantic comedies fall into the category of being extremely unpredictable because there are so many of them that look generic from their trailers. It's hard to tell if they're going to be great or downright dreadful. Not that I was looking forward to one of Netflix's most recent features in Set It Up, but the cast alone is what had me giving it a chance. This was a very strange viewing experience for me, due to the fact that I would barely call it a solid movie, but I loved watching it anyways. Set It Up is actually a movie that I would recommend to most people, but would also include an asterisk. Here's why I believe it deserves your time, but also why you shouldn't expect too much.Following Harper and Charlie, as they assist their needy bosses in everyday tasks throughout the office, these two form a plan to get their bosses to fall in love with each other in order to give themselves more free time, possibly finding a relationship of their very own in the process. The premise itself is very streamlined and nothing all that interesting comes of it, so it's hard to recommend a movie that you can call every shot to as it progresses, but quite honestly, this is a movie that benefits so heavily from its two leading performers that it warrants a recommendation from me in the end.Zoey Deutch has always impressed me, from her appearance in a lacklustre movie like Dirty Grandpa or a standout role in Everybody Wants Some!!, I have been rooting for this actress to become a star, and while this movie definitely won't get her noticed, her performance is beyond likable. On top of that, Glen Powell plays off her performance in superb a surprising ways and found myself grinning from ear to ear whenever they were on screen together. If for nothing else, I can confidently say that I'd be shocked if someone complained about their chemistry here. That being said, as I mentioned before, you kind of expect where the movie ends.The one major drawback of this film is the fact that you will be predicting each scene before it happens, due to the fact that the movie moves along in a very formulaic way. That being said, I was able to forgive this movie for being wholly unoriginal because it pretty much embraces the fact that everyone's going to guess where each character ends up. Set It Up is loaded with a slew of character moments that were quite memorable, at least for myself. Even their bosses, played by Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu, had their moments to shine. Their chemistry worked for me as well. Movies like this rely heavily on whether or not you like the characters, so for that reason alone, I found myself loving my experience with this movie, but the movie itself isn't something I would say I love upon reflection.Set It Up tries very hard to differentiate itself from many other films in its genre, but ultimately fails to impress, even though the characters are very well-rounded in my opinion. From the screenplay to the direction, everything about this film feels superbly average, so if you're looking to be blown away by a great romantic comedy, then I suggest looking elsewhere. If you can accept a generic plot and simply enjoy watching some great characters evolve for 105 minutes, then I think you'll get a kick out of this move like I did. Set It Up is a movie that'll probably be forgotten when this year comes to a close, but I think it deserves a little more than that.",Set It Up
16,bshaef,A Perfect Movie for a Hot July Friday Night,8,7 July 2018,"A good movie. Good acting, passable story with lots of laughs and New York City looked good. Netflix hit a homerun.

17,bgar-80932,Better than expected,6,22 December 2020,Two assistants with bosses that are terrible to them and keep them at work way too long team up to get their bosses in a relationship together to lighten their work load. Pretty uninspired plot. I wound up liking it more than expected though. The assistants predictably got together but near the end both were likable so you were rooting for it. It's a total chick flick but again it is better than expected.,Set It Up
18,funtasticfour,A good amount of laughs!,7,30 June 2018,"Is there even such thing as an original rom-com anymore? They all follow the same formula. This one at least tries to be something different, but of course the end is always going to be obvious. I like that the cast is mostly fresh faces that I haven't seen before. Most of the laughs come from side characters who only have a tiny part that you want to see more of, like the roommate or the elevator guy. Definitely worth a watch with your loved one.",Set It Up
19,alcantaraj-16594,HAHAHA,7,19 July 2018,"It's formulaic... but that does not mean ""Set It Up"" is a bad movie. In fact, it's good. The jokes were hit and miss but the chemistry between the leads made up for that.",Set It Up
20,TaylorYee94,Very relatable love story,8,16 October 2020,"Many of rom-com cliche really do not happen in real life. However, 'Set It Up' focuses on love itself than dramatic events. Harper and Charlie come up with some ideas for their bosses fall for each other. While two discuss their ways, they reflect on their love lives. I get to do mine.I compliment ensemble of cast. Zoey and Glen Powell's acting makes the romance so believable. They let Harper and Charlie love each other not because they are two main protagonists but because they are right for each other. Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs' comic acting is phenomenal as usual, and they really flavor the movie.",Set It Up
21,akcenat,"Conventional light-hearted rom-com with predictable story that never really progresse, but delivers exactly what it promises",6,6 July 2020,"Netflix's ""Set It Up"" - the debut feature of TV directing veteran Claire Scanlon (while heavily pregnant) - never quite innovates enough to push beyond the conventions of rom-com genre. Character development is weak and the story makes this film the kind of production which makes Netflix seem like the internet bargain bin for entertainment, but what's the harm in an easy-to-swallow movie that makes you feel good? This is escapism at its finest and thanks to the cast film is definitely worthy of your time. In the end, ""Set It Up"" may have an extremely familiar story, but it's also sweet and adorable (at times) showing that love or even sex can be powerful and really change people.Rating: 6+/7- (Fun)",Set It Up

The set up hijinks and boss-assistant dynamics both offer their fair share of quirky humour, and the central relationship has plenty of charm, though the film really starts to drag when the former starts to fade in favour of the latter and you're left waiting for the inevitable generic conclusion.6.5/10.",Set It Up

25,zac-04879,"Your Typically Witty, Fun and Light-Hearted Romcom",7,1 October 2021,"Set it Up is just another romantic comedy that follows the typical romcom's basic design; it promises an original idea, a creatively-constructed plan, charming characters and an upbeat sense of humour. Overall, the entire film is absolutely loveable.Firstly, all the film truly needs is a fun selection of actors and actresses. A romantic comedy is incomplete without appealing personalities who are sweetly able to provide witty laughs. Set it Up successfully nails that component by involving the memorable cast of Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, alongside Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.This romcom also brightly executes the storyline, which is very witty and entertaining itself. However, Set it Up is just as predictable as other romantic comedies. It also involves some unfair stereotyping. Ignore these things and it's pretty much perfect!

26,tributarystu,Vicarious lovin',7,15 June 2018,"Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell reunite after the excellent Everybody Wants Some (2016) in this low frills, high-chemistry rom-com. There isn't much to dwell on here, as 'Set It Up' proves the ideal low-stakes Friday night Netflix watch.Deutch and Powell play Harper and Charlie, two young and ambitious characters working for a very special brand of pushy, domineering bosses. When they realize their common predicament, they set out to...set up their bosses, in the hope that it will lead to quality of life improvements for themselves. In an ironic twist, the ones being pushed around leverage their insights into personal scheduling and personal preferences to ensure the mis-match ends up matching. As is usual for mischievous do-gooders, there will be fraternizing and moral conundruming. And it will be fun.Any successful rom-com hinges on the compatibility of its leads. Luckily, that's not an issue here, with both potential couples gelling or not gelling just as intended. It's the energy of all four key characters that keeps the movie alive, thanks to the odd piece of witty writing or amusing situation. I think I only rolled my eyes once at some ultra-corny moment that could have been avoided, but beyond that, director Claire Scanlon works gently and fairly with her characters. Everybody learns an important life lesson by the end and, surprisingly, it's a lesson I relate to, although I've never had the issue of overworking myself in order to avoid pursuing my passions. There are other, more pleasureful ways of doing it.",Set It Up

30,Jared_Andrews,It's like any Rom-Com you've ever seen,5,20 June 2018,"Set It Up tells the story of-you're never going to believe this-a set up. Two overworked and underappreciated assistants, Harper (Zoey Deutch) and Charlie (Glen Powell), serendipitously meet one night while working their typical late nights for their big shot bosses. After a brief exchange, they realize that they could give themselves more free time if their bosses started dating each other, so they agree to play matchmaker. Their scheme begins with an initial meet cute that was less than stellar, but it was enough ignite a spark. The relationship is off and running, and Harper and Charlie guide their bosses along every step of the way. Harper's boss (Lucy Liu) is mercilessly competitive and career driven, never giving a moment to consider her romantic life. Charlie's boss (Taye Diggs) is divorced, selfish and has some serious rage issues that are supposed to come across as humorous but are actually fairly alarming. They're far from an ideal pairing, but thanks to Harper and Charlie's ""coaching,"" they hit it off.Harper and Charlie spend more and more time together, becoming close friends as they successfully trick their bosses into falling in fake love, while they themselves possibly experience something real. Let's be honest. Romantic comedies aren't ripe for spoilers because they're all predictable. This one isn't 100% that way, but you can probably guess where the story is headed. Despite it's predictability and lack of originality, it's still mostly watchable. The two stars have natural on-screen chemistry, first as strangers, then as friends and so on. They're instantly likable individually and even more so when sharing a scene. Although story isn't a strength of the film, the dialogue is quotable and the character development certainly isn't entirely weak. The bosses feel like trite phony concepts of successful movie bosses. They're abrasive, unfeeling monsters that inexplicably climb the success ladder without an ounce of people skills. But the assistants feel like real people. They're competent yet flawed, courageous yet afraid, insulting yet caring. They mean well, even if they aren't always successful in their pursuits. Neither one is perfect, but they're a pretty much perfect set up team. Ultimately, those two save what might have otherwise been a dull, run-of-the-mill rom-com. Thanks to them, it's one of the better movies of its genre that you'll find on Netflix.",Set It Up

36,PerryAtTheMovies,A clean rom-com with a decent story...,6,29 November 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
Though a couple of years old, it was refreshing to watch a rom-com that was clean, and yet not so clean, that it was mushy and inane. All the actors brought about their own personalities that worked in unison with each others. Nothing about this film was weird or awkward, and although the ending was predictable, this was a fun story to watch.Pros:
The biggest positive that I have on the movie is the actual filming. You can tell all the way through that they didn't close streets and sidewalks off. Although distracting at times it was fun to have normal fluidity within the frame. Though some say otherwise the story was well written in my opinion. Through all the ways of trying to make the bosses fall in love to finding personal inner strength to overcome obstacles in their own lives this film definitely has an enjoyable story.Cons:
Chemistry amongst actors wasn't consistently strong throughout, and when the smaller parts of the story started to slide or wonder, so did my attention span. When my attention span started to go. I started to notice the background even more. Yes, I said I enjoyed the fluidity of the scenes because it wasn't scripted people walking by, but if you're like me and you try to catch something sneaky, or notice inconsistencies throughout the film, you'll definitely be distracted in this one, as the film crews never shutdown any parts of New York. Because they never closed down sections for filming you constantly have people standing around and watching what's happening.Overall:
Alas, a non-sappy rom-com that is good for any date night. Again, it was nice to see a clean romantic comedy that wasn't full of constant one night stands, or just about partying. There is some of language throughout, but in my opinion, not enough to ruin the entire movie.Enjoy the show!",Set It Up

Even though Set It Up brings nothing new to the formula, it is still more enjoyable than most films in this genre. The two main characters are lovable and have good chemistry. Their bosses are your typical office dragons and barely treat anyone else as human beings. The dialogue is quite witty and the pace is good too. When it comes to the plot development and the ending, it is all predictable and exactly like you probably expected. One of the positives is that it is actually not that terribly cheesy.

It's mainly due to the astonishing writing and the R-Rated jokes which don't sound vulgar or cheap like in any Seth Rogan movie however they come out as charming and kitschy; same for the two protagonists, fresh talented and good looking with catchy characters and, I guess I have a crush on Glen Powell he's very goofy and clowny in a good way making for a great performance even gay Pete Davidson crushed it too lol.

43,mauriciofernandogerhardt,2 spineless young attractive people get stomped on until they grow a spine,7,15 June 2018,"These 2 people work for 2 agressively controlling bosses in the same building. The attractive young man gets dumped by his girlfriend for being a wimp. The spineless attractive young couple make an indirect plan to make their controlling bosses become a couple, so they'll take less time from them. The plan has many obstacles (since both bosses are agressive/ competitive/ control freaks), but it works, they are going to get married, they become less assholish. The 2 spineless attractive young people slowly fall in love with each other, obviously. 
But, the aggressive male boss decided to make his ex-wife jealous, telling her he's going to marry the female boss. The ex-wife becomes jealous and they have phone-sex. The young female employee listens to the call and doesn't accept to let the marriage through, she decides to tell all that she did to her boss. The male employee doesn't agree, and this separates them. The young employee tells her boss, she gets fired. The male employee changes his mind, quits his job, and tells the bosses they shouldn't marry either.
Both bosses realize how much they depended on their employees.
The young attractive people are set up to meet each other (like the secret way they did with their bosses) and fall in love again.

At first they're surprisingly successful but a plot this ambitious could never run totally smoothly could it? So the premise of the film is very simple and the plot also develops along predicable lines. About ten minutes in, I was getting concerned about issues of workplace bullying, but then I got caught up in the energy of the story and the characters of the two assistants, Harper and Charlie, played by Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell. Yes, they are bullied and yes you could definitely say that the male boss - Rick, played by Taye Diggs - is a bit of a two dimensional caricature. But this is a romcom, not a documentary, so who cares.There are enough laughs and the characters learn a little about themselves and about life along way, and most of all everyone - all the actors - get stuck in and really enjoy themselves. Right from Lucy Liu as the female sports journalist boss, right through to the cameos by the elevator engineer and the assistant in the jewellers.It's a very wordy script delivered at a terrific pace, perhaps particularly thanks to Zoey Deutch, and most people should really enjoy it.",Set It Up

I usually only write reviews for movies that aren't major releases and were better than expected, but I had quite high expectations for this movie after reading a blurb about it in Entertainment Weekly earlier this year and felt it was worth saying that I was not at all disappointed. I truly enjoyed this entire movie and will watch it again for sure. The two leads are great (I've always really liked Zoey Deutch, and I'm glad CHAD RADWELL is on my screen again) and had fantastic chemistry. Lucy Liu was fabulous. This movie is more a romance than a comedy - it's definitely funnier than the made-for-TV romcoms and holiday romances like you see on Hallmark but someone just looking for laughs should probably look elsewhere. I hope some of these lukewarm reviews aren't from people who thought the premise sounded funny and just wanted something funny to watch because this movie can't stand on it's own as a comedy - but romcoms rarely can. By the time you reach the end of the movie, you aren't exactly rooting for the two bosses to be together anymore. But I have to say I wish that storyline had been played as a pure romance and not a subversion because in retrospect a lot of those scenes feel like a waste of time and won't be very rewarding on rewatch. But that's not exactly a criticism - that part of the narrative is still a worthwhile story and also absolutely necessary for the main plot.",Set It Up

It stars Zoey Deutch (Before I fall), Glen Powell (Hidden figures) and Lucy Liu (Kill Bill: Volume 1).This film is dumb, but entertaining. It toes the line between so bad its good and just a enjoyable film. What makes the film not so bad its good for me is the performances. The cast has perfect chemistry and their are some stand performances like Lucy Liu as Zoey Deutchs mean boss, and Tituss Burgess (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) as Creepy Tim, who delivers the films best jokes.
This film did not have me checking my watch to see when it would end.However, the films story follows the typical Romcom clichés, couple that with down right stupid story, that is so unrealistic it is probably the best joke in the entire film.

Example, when the guy undresses and pees in the elevator was just rediculous, a 5 year old would laugh at that. On the plus, the film ended well and I loved the romance between Harper and the guy (can't get to his name now), like the scene in the bedroom with the pizza. It carried a good message at the end of the day and was a sweet romance. Extra: This is the first Netflix Original I've actually finished because all of the others have been completely rubbish and a waste of time, partly due to the American culture degradation aspect, and I hate it because I Love American films, but if Netflix is the future then I don't see much hope for them globally.

Relationships between characters seem forced and unconvincing, especially the two main characters who work in the same building, yet had never seen each other before and now just drop in and out of each other's office space like they've been best buddies all along.So far as laughs, unfortunately there is not much to offer as the circumstances in which the slapstick potty humour arises, is too far fetched to instil any grain of relatability to the audience.

I watched it with a group and we just kept saying 'Oh no...' This film is basically everything that's wrong with the romcom.

78,selwynandrews-80958,Oh dear...,2,19 June 2018,"Age and experience bring perspective. That's something watching Set It Up has brought home to me. For instance, I've never understood why Ryan Reynolds is such a big star. He seems unbearably anodyne (is that an oxymoron?). But if you compare him to Glen Powell his comic chops assume the stature of William Powell's. Zoey Deutch can be quite charming when doing her 'Drew Barrymore in Fever Pitch' sports obsession schtick, but as the movie wore on (and I mean wore) her breathlessly yammery delivery began to annoy me and I began to wonder why, if they wanted a wacky brunette for this role, didn't they get the two-O Zooey? - too old for this role, I guess. And probably too (two) expensive. Incidentally, Set It Up has made me reconsider my unreasoning hatred for 500 Days of Summer - at least Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel had something approaching chemistry, which the two stars of this film desperately lack. Anyway, these two leads rattle off their lines in screwball comedy style, which wouldn't be a problem if those lines were good. Or relevant. Or witty. Or anything. The script is, unfortunately, weak and derivative. Which isn't always a fatal flaw. We all know the romcom formulae and would probably mutiny in our seats if expectations weren't met, but some fresh perspective, insight or wit is always welcome. In lieu of that, we're presented with scenes like the one where not one but two heavyset black men are wheeled on for comic effect, which, as well as being lazy and insulting, is handled in a comedically cack-handed manner. Which brings me to another problem - the direction. And the pacing. And, well, everything. But don't despair, dear reader. I watched forty-some minutes of this and stopped. The next day, I steeled myself to keep going. And I was not disappointed. Because. It. Gets. Worse. Maybe I'll see the end. Maybe (to quote The Lady from Shangai) I'll die tryin'.",Set It Up

Only the actor playing the male boss was unknown to me.Unfortunately, the movie was a big, big let down.First, for a supposed comedy, it was not very funny, brining laughter only once in a while and moderately. This is the opposite of Horrible Bosses.Another major negative relates to the bosses, and this is a key difference with the Horrible Bosses movies.The male boss' reactions and talk are so exaggerated they are unbelievable. Of course, he has to be horrible, but he almost only appears screaming or so, yelling at people, and there is nothing that could make us feel he is a human. It is impossible to get immersed or willing to follow what happens to him, which is not what should happen.The female boss is less exaggerated overall, although many times, she's also inhuman given the ovelyr-excessive reactions and talk.In Horrible Bosses, bosses were real humans (acting badly). I wanted to know what would happen to them. They were also more present.The two lead characters (the bosses' assistants) are OK-ish, although the way they accept what their bosses ask them to do and how they treat them is not always believable or relatable. While I liked Glen Powell a lot in Screem Queens, he appears rather transparent and superficial in this movie. Zoey Deutch performance and contribution was OK I suppose.The lead assistants' partners are moderately present. The female assistant's boyfriend is barely visible, but the male assistant's girlfriend is somewhat more present.Also disturbing to me, it is unclear whether the movie wants to be a romance. While many parts point to that, there is a significant amount of vulgarity, which is hard to reconcile with true romance.At the end of the day, a promising cast and idea, but a horrible output.",Set It Up

1. The camerawork isn't great. It's not bad, but there were no instances where I thought it was particularly good either.
2. This is just a personal thing, but there's a scene at a Yankees game and the Red Sox are at bat. First of all there's no way there would be a single empty seat at Yankee Stadium for a day game against the Red Sox in perfect weather. Second, you can hear the announcer say that Andrew Benintendi is batting despite it being clear that Rafael Devers is at bat. It cuts to a different shot that is of Benintendi but as a Sox fan It is hard to get over.Onto the positives, the main characters feel pretty well developed. Deutch and Powell really seem like actual people. Pete Davidson kills it as Powell's best friend and delivers some of the best lines in the whole movie. Some jokes fall flat throughout the movie but it also made me laugh out loud which I don't do very often.
The score wasn't anything to write home about either but they used ""Power of Love"" which made me think of Back to the Future and if a movie can do that It's probably pretty good. Solid 6/10.",Set It Up

It did not fall into many of the stereotypes that usually end up in rom-coms and make me yawn and roll my eyes.

136,lilyann-75000,Set it up,7,1 March 2021,"This movie stars Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell as main characters. Lucy Liu and Taye Digs as co-main characters.The story line of this movie shows love and regret. two overworked and underpaid assistants come up with a plan to get their bosses off their backs by setting the up with each other.The makers behind this movie are Claire Scanlon (director), Juliet berman and Justin Nappi (producers) and is writen by Katie Silberman.
Claire Scanlon is an American editor and director. she has been nominated for four primetime emmy awards, winning one, for editing work on the office and the apprentice. Scanlon directed the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt interactive special for Netflix.Juliet berman is a producer known for Set it up(2018), the awkward moment(2014), and the indian in thc cupboard(1995). Justin Nappi is a producer and actor, known for all is lost(2013), Arbitrage(2012) and Set it up(2018). Katie Silberman is as American screenwriter and film producer. She is most known for writing the screenplays to set it up and booksmart(2019).Zoey Deutch is one of two main characters in this film. She has been in more movies, such as Before i fall, Vampire academy, Why him? and many others. Zoey Deutch is known for being the daughter of director Howard Deutch and actress-director Lea Tompson. She gained recognition fo her roles in the film Everybody wants some!!, Netflix comedy series The politician and obviously the Netflix film Set it up. Glen Powell is another main character is this film. Glen Powell's career started to turn in 2016, when he delivered a scene-stealing one-two punch, first as an elder statesman collage baseball player in Richards Linklater's 2016 film, Everybody wants some!!, and then as John Glenn in the critical and commercial surprise hit Hidden FiguresIn my opinion this film is showing us that there is so many more ways to fall in love with someone. It shows that even your closest friends can become more important to you than you could have ever imagined, it explaines that you must believe that what your doing it right until the pages turn and you no longer feel the way you used to. The movie symbolizes that once you have already made the mistake, you then realize that the only thing that you can do is own up to what you have done. This film hints that when someone tells you that what you have done is wrong and you then go and disagree with them it's because you don't want to admit that they are right. Then one you finally gone and done the right thing, the person you care about most isn't there to hold you because you already messed it up. What i dislike about this movie is that it's only shown from two points of view, Harper (Zoey Deutch) and Charlie (Glen Powell). Harper and Charlie are setting up their bosses so that they don't have to work long hours, but i believe that it should be shown from Kristen and Ricks (the bosses) view, as the storyline is based upon them two being together (in order for more free time). Harper wants free time because she wants a love life and because she wants to write articles for Kristen. Charlie wants free time becayse he wants to spend more time with his girlfriend. So that's why they came up with idea to begin with.Hope you like my review and if you haven't yet watched the film the you should check it out. :)March 1st, 2021 Written by-lpurple28",Set It Up

142,nickdaly29,Rom-com with flaws,5,22 July 2018,"Before seeing this movie, I had high expectations. A 62 Metacritic is fairly impressive for a movie like this, but after watching it I realized that it only had 14 critic reviews, not many. Hence, 62 makes sense. If this movie wasn't released on Netflix and it had a worldwide release, I bet you the Metacritic score would be around a 50, where it should be. Long story short, Set it Up revolves around 2 assistants, Harper and Charlie, who are so overworked by their bosses day in and day out that it seems they have lost themselves in the process. They are unable to have a social life because their bosses take up way too much of their time. They decide to set up their bosses so that they will spend more time with each other meaning they won't be in the office. This would give the assistants some time to themselves. In all honesty, it seems like a reasonable plan. This plot is something I haven't heard of so I was intrigued. However, once you watch the first ten minutes, you can predict how the majority of the movie will turn out. If you are really good, you may even be able to predict how the movie will turn out just by watching the trailer. I knew deep down how this movie would turn out, but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. Overall, it was as basic as rom-coms get. The highlight of this movie was definitely the hidden connection between Zoey Deutch (Harper) and Glen Powell (Charlie). They were cast perfectly for their roles and you can tell the chemistry is there regardless of the characters they play. On the other hand, I feel that there were major miscasting decisions. Lucy Liu (Kirsten) does her best to play the role of the power female in charge, but something about her performance falls flat. It's as if her character is supposed to have this hidden depth to it, but we never quite see her come full circle until the last few minutes. She is a brilliant and hardworking woman, but for some reasons in movies like these, the powerful women fail to see the truth until the very end. Taye Diggs (Rick) was completely miscast along was others like Joan Smalls (Suze). I can tell he tried to do his best with the script he was given, but he missed the mark for some reason. I understand that he is technically a supporting role, but his character just simply wasn't as memorable as the mean boss who is 'secretly' still in love with his ex-wife should be. The script had its up and downs. It was definitely more 'rom' than 'com' so it was missing a lot of comedic aspects. This was disappointing because I feel as if this movie had a lot of room for comedy especially since I know Zoey and Glen could have sold the jokes. There were some comedy attempts, but none of them really worked except the occasional Creepy Tim moments. I must admit that his character definitely gave me a few laughs, but I would have loved a lot more laughs from this movie all around. This movie would definitely be a 6 or 7 out of 10 if: 1-The bosses were recast, 2-It had more comedic relief, and 3- The script was less predictable. But other than that, it was your average rom-com. Hats off to Zoey and Glen for their acting and chemistry...",Set It Up

It portrayed all the coloured people (Lui,Diggs, and Smalls) as the evil characters in the movie (although Lui gets better at the end) being rude, condescending, narcissistic, angry, violent, cheaters. While the two main characters (both white) are at their mercy, seemingly innocent, and your made to feel bad for them, seek their revenge on these evil people. The other coloured characters (Ouzts and Burgess) play fools in the movie (the delivery guy who pees in the elevator and the creepy tim) like c'mon who wrote this movie, and why would Lui and Diggs even sign off on it. It is hard not to see that all the coloured characters were given stereotypical raciest roles and Hollywood and Netflix could do better.",Set It Up
164,agusgc-67312,Set It Up: Netflix's successful attempt at reviving romantic comedies,9,17 January 2019,"How long has it been since you have seen Hollywood make a good rom-com, that had you laughing for the entire movie? The romantic comedy genre had been going through a little bit of a drought the last few years. But all of that changed when Netflix released their own rom-com, Set It Up, during June of 2018. The exciting aspect of this movie is that not only does it have the classic rom-com elements but it also has that modern twist that we all enjoy.Set It Up tells the story of two underpaid and overworked assistants who meet while trying to get their bosses dinner. To lighten up their workload and be able to have free time, they make a master plan to make their bosses fall in love with each other. Like any other rom-com movie, nothing goes according to plan so Harper (Zoey Deutch) and Charlie Young (Glen Powell) have to work together to ensure that their plan works. As they are trying to accomplish their mission, they use technology as well as their, more like Harper's, knowledge of romantic movies.Harper and Charlie compare their plan to that of ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Cyrano de Bergerac."" I couldn't agree with this statement more . One of the reasons why this movie works so well is because it has all of the key elements of the classical movies, those that we all love so much but with a modern touch. Rom- coms have become so outdated that the newer generations can't relate to them anymore which is regrettable for those of us who enjoy watching them. Set it Up embraces and combines our favorite romantic movies to make an even better love story.Another reason as to why this is a great movie is due to an amazing set of supporting characters. Kirsten Stevens (Lucy Liu), Harper's boss, is a well renowned sports editor who is feared by everyone. Lucy Liu is an incredible actress that has worked in many of Hollywood's best films. One of them being Charlie's Angels where she played of the main roles as Alex Munday, one of the three angels. Tituss Burgess (""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"") brings his silliness or wackiness in the role of creepy tim, the elevator operator of the building where Harper and Charlie work. The character of Duncan (Pete Davidson) was not really well executed in my opinion. He is Charlie's gay roommate and friend which you don't know if he is trying to make you laugh or actually has a deeper purpose that no one has been able to decipher.One of the best scenes in the movie is when Harper and Charlie go on a journey to get pizza and safely transport it to Charlie's room. Harper shows once again her corky side by treating the pizza like her love of her life as well as her child. Once they get to Charlie's room, after they climbed the fire escape stairs, they share a very cute moment where we can clearly see the love tension. They have a great chemistry that really shows in the characters, we get to people who joke around like best friends but can also have the type of love that you have with a partner.These two young assistants take us through a fun journey of people finding love or realizing deep statements about themselves. If you are tired of watching the classical rom-com from Hollywood over and over again, trust my advice and enjoy the beauty of Set It Up. That is if you are ready to laugh from beginning till end.",Set It Up
165,amh-07822,Just Another Rom-com,4,20 February 2019,"Two overworked, underpaid assistants follow their bosses around doing everything asked of them while they are at work. Working long hours, receiving endless yelling, and having almost no social life is how Harper and Charlie live their lives until they come up with the brilliant plan to set up their bosses. The movie Set It Up is a Netflix original movie which tells the lives of the two assistants and their mission to set up their bosses. The rom-com starring Zoey Deutch (Harper), Glenn Powell (Charlie), Taye Diggs (Rick), and Lucy Liu (Kirsten) has a promising story, but unfortunately it does not pull through.When the two assistants, Harper and Charlie, first meet each other when arguing over dinner for their bosses, we already know that they're going to have more interactions and eventually fall in love with each other. As a romantic comedy on Netflix, we know that the two main characters are going to end up together at the end of the movie, which is why most of us are watching it. To get an unrealistic feel for what being in a relationship is, we watch these cheesy, romantic, comedic movies. What makes these movies stand out from one another is the plot within the movie. Set It Up, directed by Claire Scanlon was hyped up as being the return of the rom-com. However, with too much background information on some people, and the underdevelopment of other characters, the movie, unfortunately, did not live up to its expectations.""Jessica the phones! Jonathan cancel my 10:00. Conor, get in here. Conor? Bring me my lunch! What's my password?"" The first things you hear from the movie automatically sets the tone of how the movie will flow. Soon after, as everyone is leaving the office, we're introduced to Harper. A young girl, somewhere in her twenties telling everyone to ""be free"" and ""save yourself,"" is seen on one of the highest floors in the building when suddenly her boss, Kirsten, starts screaming at her to get her dinner. We're then switched to a scene of a guy, Charlie, waiting outside of a high class bar for his boss, Rick, late at night. The first 10 minutes of the movie immediately shows us who the bosses and assistants are, and how they act towards each other.Introducing the assistants' best friends seemed well planned for the story to develop, but unfortunately Becca and Duncan's characters weren't developed too much. We find out that Becca is going to get married soon, and that Duncan is gay, but other than that, they aren't mentioned much more throughout the movie. Although Becca comes back towards the end of the movie saying ""you like because, and you love despite,"" Becca's character is not developed. She appears and disappears randomly, and we aren't given the opportunity to understand who she is. Duncan on the other hand, only comes back into the story when he's either having sex, or trying to invite other people to places he's not supposed to.Harper and Charlie never meet each other in the workplace until they get into a fight over their boss's dinners and come up with the idea of setting up their bosses. Their lives are instantly connected. Through secret meetings, and getting their bosses to meet at the same places ""coincidentally,"" Harper and Charlie, unsurprisingly, are successful in getting their bosses together. However, when Rick cheats on Kirsten with his ex-wife, things get messy. Finding out about the cheating on their way to their wedding, Kirsten calls off the wedding and leaves the airport. Rick was stranded alone and we find that this is not the setup the movie title is referring to. As Harper is retrieving her stuff from her desk after being fired for deceiving her boss, she finds herself being setup with Charlie by Kirsten. ""Coincidentally,"" Charlie is waiting just outside of the building waiting to meet Kirsten. The two find themselves in love with each other after fighting with each other over food and attempting to setup their bosses.Set It Up had a promising storyline in the beginning, but as time dragged on, the movie got more and more predictable. This predictable, boring, time consuming movie ends with the two characters together in the end like they're supposed to be. Kirsten, Harper's seemingly hateful and much too intense boss, turns into the ""good guy,"" helping Harper with her writing and setting up Harper with Charlie. The combination of underdeveloped characters and a predictable story plot ""set it up"" for failure.",Set It Up
