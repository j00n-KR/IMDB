0,nogodnomasters,Madness Gives us Words,8,8 April 2019,"This is the tale of the unorthodox beginnings of the Oxford dictionary. James A.H. Murray, who has limited schooling, impresses and leads a group of Oxford professors in the undertaking. He is aided by an American schizophrenic, Dr. William Chester Minor who is locked up in an asylum for the criminally insane. He shot and killed a man, believing he was an individual who was after him. It appears some of his issues may be PTSD.Mel Gibson plays the professor and Sean Penn the madman. This is a well acted period piece that most likely few people will see and then they will be shocked on Oscar night.",The Professor and the Madman
1,kosmasp,Who's mad?,9,18 February 2020,"Sometimes you have to wonder, how mad some people can be. On the other hand, who defines their madness and how can you help them? A situation that is similar to the ""help me, to help you"". Well in this case help is being received, even if the person receiving the second chance may seem not worthy of that. But Sean Penn and Mel Gibson really are on top of their game.This is based on a true story and while that may feel like something some viewers dread, it does work in this case. Really thrilling and filled with suspense and human drama, this has it almost all. Very well made and quite a rollercoaster ride of a movie (if you like dramas)",The Professor and the Madman
2,classicsoncall,"""Together we shall shrink the darkness, until there is only light.""",8,7 December 2019,"I thought the story here was fairly compelling, though after a while I began to find it almost comical the amount of time and effort that was being put into defining the meaning of a single word. All for a good cause of course, because this was how the Oxford English Dictionary came about, but even with Dr. James Murray's (Mel Gibson) devotion to duty, one intuitively realizes that a project like this could never be finished. Finished in the sense that the language would at some point stop evolving. It's a pretty safe bet that 'emoji' wasn't in that first edition.In an unusual pairing, Mel Gibson and Sean Penn are cast opposite each other here as meaningful collaborators, but it comes with a twist. Penn's character is a former Civil War Army surgeon found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. The man truly is insane with regard to the conspiracy he holds in his mind of an elusive stalker who is intent on killing him. The narrative doesn't give even an inkling of anyone who might be out to 'get him', so to speak, and that delusion remains with Dr. William Chester Minor (Penn) throughout the story. However in his more lucid moments, Dr. Minor is repentant over the death of the man he mistakenly killed, and spends his entire prison life attempting to make it up to the victim's widow, both monetarily and by way of teaching the woman how to read. In time, Eliza Merrett's (Natalie Dormer) initial negative assessment of Minor turns to thoughts of forgiveness and love, an idea that Minor can't cope with in a rational way. Taking it to an extreme, Minor castrates himself to insure that he can never return favor back to the woman he caused to become a widow.Penn, who I'm no fan of, really does do a remarkable job in the role of Minor, particularly during that phase of the picture in which he envisions no chance at redemption given Mrs. Merrett's ambiguous profession of love. As Mr. Murray struggles with his own efforts to move the dictionary process along, his relationship with Minor becomes personal upon repeated visits to the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum where Minor is held. With unlimited passion, Murray prevails upon the authorities to come up with a way to free Minor and provide him some measure of relief from both his imprisonment and his self imposed mental isolation. In due course, Murray himself is vindicated for the passion he put into his work at Oxford, and is allowed to continue leadership on the team that eventually fulfilled the mission some years following his death.It's probably fair to say that not all viewers will find the film quite as intriguing as I did. It moves rather slow and the subject matter is rather tepid, so action junkies ought skip this one altogether. For others though, the picture can be quite engaging with a lot to offer if you're a fan of the principals and wish to witness some very fine acting. Gibson and Penn are both superb.",The Professor and the Madman
3,CinemaSerf,Penn & Gibson really immerse themselves in their roles...,7,15 April 2020,"This is the best effort I've seen from Sean Penn since ""Milk"" almost twelve years ago. His portrayal of the schizophrenic William Chester Minor who, having spent almost 40 years of his life in Broadmoor psychiatric hospital, became one of the single most significant contributors to the orginal Oxford Dictionary of English is superb. He captures the flaws of this paranoid etymologist warts and all, and gels very well with Mel Gibson who, as the compiler of the tome - Dr. James Murray - also turns in a good, strong and, latterly, sympathetic and understanding performance too. This is essentially a double-hander with Natalie Dormer, Eddie Marsan and Steve Coogan helping to explain the story and releasing some of the emotional steam from time to time. It's a little slow in places, two hours could have done justice to this interesting story which seems overly padded at time. As you'd expect; it looks great with plenty of serious attention to detail and it also shines a little light on Victorian/Edwardian attitudes to mental illness.",The Professor and the Madman
4,deloudelouvain,It's okay but certainly not Oscar-worthy.,6,23 October 2019,"First of all I think everybody should calm down, or at least the ones that speak of Oscar winning performances. There is no doubt the acting was good, and that's what you should expect from names like Sean Penn, Natalie Dormer and Mel Gibson, but I can assure you they won't win an Oscar for this movie. Let's just be realistic, the movie is sometimes a bit long and boring, not really a captivating movie as the story concerns. And it's not because it's based on a true story that it makes it better. But like said before the acting is good so for that alone it's a movie worth watching. Would I watch it a second time though? No, absolutely not.",The Professor and the Madman
5,ksf-2,interesting meeting of very different people...spoilers,7,28 September 2020,"SPOILERS ...one of the two films directed by iranian Farhad Safinia. Sean Penn and Mel Gibson. James Murray (Gibson) is compiling a collection of every word used in the english language, and receives numerous entries from Dr. Minor. Minor (Penn) happens to be a patient in the asylum for the insane. according to wikipedia dot org, there was quite the legal battle involving GIbson, Safinia, and the production company; due to being denied permission to film in Oxford, Gibson claimed he was not allowed to complete the film; he lost the case, and was forced to complete filming in alternate locations. also acc to wikipedia, the actual doctor minor mutilated himself horribly, and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. the film itself is quite graphic and violent, and not for the children! British author and comic Steve Coogan is Frederick Furnivall. interesting intersection of people coming together from different walks of life. pretty graphic though.",The Professor and the Madman
6,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Sadly underwhelming historical biography,4,5 April 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDr. William Chester Minor (Sean Penn), a former American civil war commander, is found not guilty by way of insanity of murder, and sent to Broadmoor Mental Asylum. After saving the life of a young guard, he wins special favour among the guards and senior doctors at the asylum, and is allowed to indulge his seemingly crazy tasks that they can't make sense of. Meanwhile, Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson), a commoner, is attempting to write the definitive edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. The two men form an unlikely partnership in achieving this task, whilst developing a personal friendship and affinity for each other's cause.The recessionary air still lingers over Hollywood, where anything that doesn't guarantee a cash return won't make it to the screen. Whilst rehashes of long dormant franchises still seem like a sure bet, more obscure, independent stuff can still find itself banished to the wayside, as seems to be the case with Farhad Safina's historical biopic set in 19th century England. While the story of how the concise Oxford English dictionary was put together is an interesting story in itself, it maybe doesn't have the right dynamism for a feature film, a problem that makes itself known in Farhad's film.Such a lightweight story gets a much needed boost by having two powerhouse leads to inject it with some passion and gravitas, and so we have Gibson retrieving his Braveheart Scottish lilt, and Penn saturating his role with the deranged intensity he's known for. While both seem committed and immersed in their roles, there's an unfortunate hamminess and over-emanation to them that wears them down a bit. Safina doesn't pace the film evenly enough over the course of two hours, and the really starts to drag in the latter half.It's a story that needed to be told, but maybe film wasn't the right format for it. It just isn't enthralling or edgy enough to really get into it, especially for its duration. The historical accuracy of the time period, and costume design, is convincingly caught, and the performances, from the leads as well as a supporting cast including Eddie Marsan, Steve Coogan and Laurence Fox, are too impassioned to be truly awful, but you come away thinking it might have fallen to the wayside for other reasons than it's profit margin. **",The Professor and the Madman
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Solid but forgettable.,6,20 May 2020,"By all accounts, the film's production was a complete mess. Missing scenes, unfulfilled obligations and lack of promised finance all led towards a lawsuit and a distinctly splintered release. It was so bad, apparently, that Gibson actively discourages his fans from watching the thing, and the director - who may or may not have been replaced during filming - is credited only as 'P.B. Shemran'. Thankfully, aside from having a couple of out-of-place 'GoPro' shots, 'The Professor And The Madman (2019)' doesn't seem to be affected by its tumultuous creation. It tells the tale of the man who spearheaded the first edition of the Oxford English dictionary, while also chronicling his friendship with a Schizophrenic doctor residing in Broadmoor Hospital. It's an entertaining enough period piece with an interesting setting, even if it isn't exactly enthralling or, even, all that memorable. The performances are good and the script is steady. Ultimately, it's a generally solid experience. It doesn't have all that much impact, though. In fact, it sort of goes in one ear and out the other. That's not necessarily bad, mind you. The piece passes the time admirably and it is, perhaps surprisingly, generally well-made. If you think you'll like it, you probably will. 6/10",The Professor and the Madman
8,westsideschl,Fairly Accurate Retelling,10,30 August 2019,"I can't seem to find/recall the source. A couple of years back I remember seeing a movie telling a similar story, but w/little on the Merrett & Dr. Minor aspect. Anyway, a fairly accurate dramatization of the history of ""A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles"" (aka Oxford English Dictionary) 1857-1928: The Dictionary is published in fascicles (installments) w/major revisions up to 1992. In 1928 it comprised 12 vol., 414,825 words, 1,827,306 quotations showing usage. And as we all know the language is constantly changing/evolving.Kudos to the actors & production crew; you know a story is well told when you find yourself holding your breath with a sense of stillness during certain scenes particularly the meetings at the asylum first between Dr. Minor & Murray, and then with Merrett.",The Professor and the Madman
9,ops-52535,"if wrongsplet, blaim mr.murray",10,16 April 2019,"This was a fantastic and brilliantly made historical drama, about the real creation of the 1st edition of the oxford english dictionary. how historically correct it is i shall not judge,but as to wikipedia, he got his proffesorate almost post mortem in 1908, so the accuracy may be a bit of level,but james murray i knew who he was. its a film for everyone, but some interest in the alphabet, and a bit knowledge of history may boost this film alot. its is also a film for the profound lover of filology, because its filology to the fingertips. the only thng i really miss in this glorious production, are the timelineinformation, because earth wasnt made in one day,and so wasnt the OED either, it was completed officially sometime in the late 1920's.tha cast consists of a ton of hevyweighters from british,american to australian actors, and the highlander and geordie dialects tweets like a songbird throughout the whole movie. i love the choice of sean penn as the madman, he does act and have the appearence of a mad man for sure, in a setup like this film the normal choice of delivery for this kind of film would normally have been ben kingsley i'm glad they didnt cause i guess mr kingsley would SPLIT into thousand pieces of GLASS, in seer dispair of all the biographical roles he has acted, ghandi,eichman and so on. also mel gibso gives this film the glory it shall have because they played darn good together, mr gibson and mr penn.bravo
i must also mention the character mr munch, the prison/hospital guard played by eddie marsan and mre murray played by jennifer ehle, they both make some excellent performances on the screen, they give sanity,hope and humanity to this film by their acting.i love the way they talked or conversated in this movie, and that mustve been due to a good script, and possibly by help from a linguist. the diction and tone a so very well balanced thats it a sheer joy to just listen to what is said. the score are of the same era of time, and see if you can count how many times it pauses, or for how long you forget that the music are really there. magnificently done and dacapo to that.the filmography and editing are in my sense of view flawless, the glow of light and sound near perfect, and the playtime were , for an old grumpy man, with a hang on weird science and history, perfect. its a great movie that you should not miss, its a lovely and positive in its use of word and action.",The Professor and the Madman
10,Thanos_Alfie,The first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary...,6,4 March 2020,"""The Professor and the Madman"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the story of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. It started in the mid 19th century from Professor James Murray who received help (10,000 entries) from Dr. William Minor who was a patient at Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting story which is based in true events. The interpretations of both Sean Penn who played as Dr. William Chester Minor and Mel Gibson who played as Professor James Murray were exceptional. I also have to say that the interpretations of Jennifer Ehle's who played as Ada Murray and Natalie Dormer's who played as Eliza Merrett were equally good. Regarding the direction which was made by Farhad Safinia, I believe that he did a good job on it and he presented very well the stereotypes of that time, the difficulties of life on that time and how high society was influencing people and their opinion. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because except of the nice way of presenting those time in England, it's a good way of learning how the first Oxford English dictionary was created and of course the story behind it.",The Professor and the Madman
11,eddie_baggins,A dramatic failure,2,22 December 2019,"On paper a film that seems to scream prestige potential, The Professor and the Madman is a sadly lifeless dramatic biopic that's myriad of problems behind the scenes has clearly ridden the film unsalvagable from its lifeless and generic final product.A passion project for its star and producer Mel Gibson, who purchased the rights to Simon Winchester's novel on which the film is based way back in 1999, only for him to struggle to bring the story to the big screen until now with the help of his Apocalypto writer Farhad Safinia (here going by the name of P.B. Sherman due to legal battles), which is unfortunate, as the wait has certainly not been worth it.It's nothing to do with Gibson as such, whose as good as his been over the last decade or so as real life Oxford dictionary master James Murray, but despite a sizable budget, a formidable cast and the amazing story of how the most well-known dictionary of all time came to be, Madman wastes every single tool at its disposable along its journey to shine a light on Murray's trials and those of Sean Penn's murderous and clearly insane war veteran Dr. William Chester Minor.The film is nothing more than a series of boxes being ticked off, told with little heart, care or imagination and where fault is to be pinpointed is hard to do as Safinia himself and Gibson disowned the project well before final completion in a bitter feud with its financiers, who ended up taking matters into their own hands and finalising the end product and extra filming courtesy of Todd Komarnicki, in what's a film that was abandoned by its heart and soul.Not many films end up achieving much good when these type of unfortunate circumstances and bickering's take place and while elements of the lethargic offering lay mostly at the feet of this issue, its also no excuse for its extremely tame and care free delving into of the dictionary's birth and the friendship that sprung up between Murray and Minor.Completely overplayed by a mumbling, jumbling Sean Penn (who has been out of form for years now), Minor is tough character to portray no doubt but as our decade spanning narrative takes us along for the journey these two men took, by the end of it we end up feeling just as cold as we do when we first meet these men as Safinia and Komarnicki fail to create any spark in the editing suite or in the filming of this material that makes a tour hour run time seem like an endless slog.So much so that not even the likes of supports such as Natalie Dormer, Ioan Gruffudd, Steve Coogan or Jennifer Ehle can add any extra spice to a film that so clearly could've been but unfortunately isn't, a missed opportunity to shine a light on an intriguing friendship centred around an important moment in our human history.Final Say -Facing an uphill battle to even have seen the light of day due to behind the scenes raucous, The Professor and the Madman would've been served better to remain heard of but never seen as this dull and uninviting drama fails to ignite in any way, shape or form despite its loaded material.1 luscious beard out of 5",The Professor and the Madman
12,imseeg,"Any bad? Yes, it's too slow and it lasts way too long.",5,24 April 2020,"This is an EDUCATIONAL (dont run away) and a dramatic movie with good acting by 2 leading actors, whom have made flop after flop recently, but both Sean Penn AND Mel Gibson perform excellently this time around. They still can act well! Many splendid supporting actors as well.The good: the story about the creation of one of the first dictionaries seemed boring at first glance; how does one make an interesting movie about a dictionary? They made it interesting because all the characters in this movie are being portrayed with so much verve and wit.Any bad? Yes, this story lasts 2 hours, which is about half an hour too long, therefore it becomes pretty tedious to watch half way through. Had more potential. Not recommended, yet not discarded either...",The Professor and the Madman
13,billcr12,Penn Rules,9,24 April 2019,"It is only April as I write this review, but Sean Penn can begin preparing his Oscar speech for best actor next year. He is absolutely riveting as Dr. William Minor, an American surgeon who lost his marbles during the Civil War and wound up in England for a little r & r. Under severe delusions he killed a completely innocent man and ended up at Broadmoor, Britain's infamous asylum. Through a series of improbable events, Minor connects with Professor James Murray, a man obsessed with the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. The pair combine for the creation of the great book. The movie is based upon the book by Simon Winchester, and it is faithful adaptation of the excellent read. Mel Gibson is Murray and he is as equally believable as Penn is as Minor. The supporting cast are also excellent. So far, The Professor and the Madman is the best movie of the year.",The Professor and the Madman

16,peterp-450-298716,I was fascinated by this movie. And not only because of their imposing beards.,7,5 September 2019,"If I am to fashion a book,
I'll need a spine.Sometimes you are awed by cinema films because of the immensely beautiful special effects and the use of unparalleled images. The other time it's the inventiveness of a story and the way it's structured. And in other films, you look with admiration at the way certain actors play their role. Is it obligatory that a movie looks phenomenal to you? Or does it happen sometimes that while reading a novel, in which the sophisticated juggling with words creates literary excitement, you have difficulties to keep your eyes open and your head nods back after a short period after which a little snoring is heard? Well, in that case, it might be better for you to ignore this film. Because in ""The Professor and the Madman"" there are no breathtaking special effects to be found and the emphasis is on the literature from this world. For me, this was a masterful and fascinating story about how the world-famous ""Oxford Dictionary"" was put together.Even though this takes place around 1850, there are certain facts that can be found in our contemporary society. And, of course, there are also substantial differences. The film is not just about the realization of an almost impossible assignment with limited resources. It's also about the existence of class differences, scientific ignorance and the application of inhumane practices in psychiatric institutions. It demonstrates the pretentious behavior of the wealthy class and the political juggling in intellectual circles. And in between these topics, there's the Scotsman James Murray (Mel Gibson) who, with the help of countless strips of paper, miles of knitting yarn and with a ton of patience, tries to contain and interpret every existing English word in literary history. An assignment that requires immense efforts to the detriment of his wife and children.I'm aware that literature (at least for me) isn't exactly a sexy subject. I already assumed that this film wouldn't be intense or exciting. But just like with ""Kill your Darlings"", this historical drama fascinated me. And this because of the challenge Murray took on. I looked in disbelief at the method that was applied. And I was constantly wondering if this was achievable. It's an era where people didn't know the word digital yet (one word they don't need to concentrate on) and they didn't have computers at their disposal. No indexed work file with linked cross-reference tables on which one could release SQL statements, to do big data analyses. No, everything was scribbled down with old-fashioned ink pens on sheets of paper and then attached to the walls. Can it be more primitive? It's wonderful to see that James Murray actually applies the principle of content management here by encouraging the English people to write down English words and send them to them by mail (indeed no e-mail).It's mainly the brilliant acting of the gentlemen Mel Gibson and Sean Penn that makes the film more interesting. Gibson plays the Scottish academic and autodidact who, despite the opposition of the established values from the Oxford Board of Directors, is appointed as the driving force behind this renowned work and is a model of perseverance. My favorite scene is where he's introduced to these intellectual snobs who don't even bother to hide their aversion. The moment Murray lists all the languages he knows and I saw those bewildered faces of the narcissistic academics, it immediately reminded me of the scene in a student bar with Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"". There, too, such a rich man's son with a snobbish attitude was put in his place in a brilliant way.Mel Gibson's sparring partner is William Chester Minor (Sean Penn), an American army-doctor and war veteran who is haunted by delusions. In a phase of extreme madness and schizophrenia, he kills an innocent passer-by and ends up in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. In short, an institution for criminal madmen. The doctor on duty there, Dr. Richard Brayn (Stephen Dillane), initially envisages a decent treatment (which leads to certain privileges such as a large room with a gigantic library). But towards the end, he eventually seems to be a supporter of terrible techniques anyway. It's thanks to a book that Minor received from his victim's widow (In my eyes, the weakest aspect in this film) that he finds out that Murray asked the English people for help. And that's the impetus for Minor to get to work and to overload Murray with thousands of words for the dictionary. The way Penn plays this tormented and insane man is simply formidable. And yes, this tends to look like overacting. But isn't it necessary to portray this type of individual? Minor is after all nuts.There are several facets that are beautifully worked out. Such as the detailed decor in which the story takes place. London during the 19th century with its typical costumes, way people behave and attributes. But above all, the interaction between the two extremely brilliant gentlemen is perfectly portrayed. Two tortured intellectuals. The one because of the obstructions and impossibility of the assignment. The other because of the inner demons that make his life unbearable. An individual suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An unknown condition in those days. The dialogues in which the two gentlemen show their love for English vocabulary is sublime to watch. The way in which they both perk up while saying one word after the other with a smile is a feast for the eyes. Perhaps the corny storyline about the widow Eliza Merrett (Natalie ""Game of Thrones"" Dormer) didn't really fit in with the whole and the emphatic message about regret and forgiveness was a bit over-the-top. But despite those shortcomings, I found this historic film based on true facts fascinating enough. So if you have questions about the origin of dictionaries, you shouldn't miss this film. At the same time, you also have an idea about academic intellectualism (and their self-righteous and arrogant attitude) and the horror of 19th-century psychiatry. But what I wondered the most: are Gibson's and Penn's beard the result of natural beard growth or props?More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Professor and the Madman
17,truemythmedia,"Fascinating Story, Boring Movie",4,22 November 2019,"Though I've given this film a two star rating, I want to say that I don't think this movie is bad, but it's not particularly good either. The story it tells is interesting, but it's bogged down with needless side plots and characters, to the point where the movie just feels like it's plodding along endlessly through the second act. The direction is sort of lifeless throughout the movie, and it makes moments of earnestness seem far more melodramatic than they ever needed to be. The themes that were hinted at in this movie were never fully developed, and in the end, we come away feeling a bit unsatisfied with how the whole thing wraps up. That being said, I learned a lot about the Oxford dictionary, far more than I ever thought I would have, and the story beneath it all is quite fascinating, which is why, I'm sure, this was Gibson's passion project for a number of years.

Also about the man who became his friend and colleague, William Chester Minor, who submitted more than 10,000 entries while he was confined at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum after being found not guilty of murder due to insanity.It has Mel Gibson and Sean Penn in the leading roles, playing James Murray and William Chester Minor. Two phenomenal performances that deserved attention from the critics, but you the viewer will most likely find it to be quite amazing. It's possibly among the actors' best performances, nailing the accents and mannerisms plus the mental breakdown that Sean Penn's character has he makes it so believable. Natalie Dormer, Eddie Marsan, Jennifer Ehle, Jeremy Irvine, David O'Hara, Ioan Gruffudd, Stephen Dillane, Laurence Fox, and Steve Coogan is among the supporting cast. Everyone does a fantastic job, I didn't really see any bad acting throughout the two hour length.Why did this film get so much hate from the critics? Is it because of Mel Gibson and all the behind the scenes drama? Possibly, but what I know is that they're wrong. The Professor and The Madman is a great biopic, on paper this should be ""unfilmable"" as a critic wrote but it's honestly such a great adaption and a memorable film.

25,jrarichards,Wonderfully-acted and spellbinding portrayal of a real-life story mostly presented FAITHFULLY,10,24 February 2021,"History, like life, is complex and nuanced and regularly fed by doses of unlikely or even impossible circumstances or coincidences.None of us were around in Victorian times, so each time we try to put ourselves in their shoes, we get only an approximation of it - even when, as with the storyline in ""The Professor and the Madman"", we have handsomely rich documentation from the time available, thanks: a) to the mixture of meticulousness, duty, devotion and energy that were the best features of that time, and b) to the fact that that era generated enough power and stability of institutions and systems in the United Kingdom that the country stood up very well thank you to the worst that the world could throw at it for 100 years and more. Unlike in, say, Poland, its heritage was not destroyed or ransacked by merciless invaders, and was nurtured and kept safe and intact.The vision and mission on show is to celebrate the love of English, and the vision of Scotsman James Murray (1837-1915) (here played stunningly well by Mel Gibson) - the process of building that Oxford English Dictonary (eventually ""finished"" in 1928 at least in the first ""round"" of its work begun in 1857, and featuring Murray from the 1870s on) was to be a democractic one operating bottom-up, from the people, more than top-down (from the elite).Along with Russell Crowe, Mel Gibson is made for roles of determined, driven, near-obsessively passionate individuals, and this portrayal is GREAT. Of course, that means a long-suffering wife (very sensitively done by Jeniffer Ehle), and children who would have looked a bit neglected, had they not (really) been roped into the immense and near-endless work to compile the Dictionary!Happily, the re-creation of the contact and contrast between the self-taught Scotsman and the dons of Oxford trying to get the dictionary done at last is indeed a matter of nuance. It is not overall the cliche clash with the snobs (even if some of that is present), as Murray the schoolmaster but also basically bank clerk is genius enough to have won advocates among the academics, not least Frederick Furnivall (1825-1910) (here played - again very nicely - by Steve Coogan, no less!). Take 5 minutes to scan the bio of Furnivall - it's a CLASSICALLY Victorian one - warts and all, which shows those people at their baffingly magnificent and diverse best. Though we don't see too much of it here, Furnivall was as major a contributor of OED definitions and examples from history as was the legendary Dr William Chester Minor (1834-1920) - the stunningly interesting, conflicted, tortured and sad character that Sean Penn conveys so amazingly here.Yes, indeed, as American/Brit Bill Bryson noted a long time ago in his as usual witty but highly competent summary of the situation (in the book ""Mother Tongue""), a significant chunk of the OED WAS compiled by a sufferer of persecution mania from the United States incarcerated on British soil at the famous Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. That had only opened in 1863 - less than a decade before the events in the film, and - in one of the few liberties the film takes - Superintendent Richard Brayn (a great piece of work here by Stephen Dillane) was NOT actually there until 1896. However, both he and his real-life predecessors did indeed believe that their mission was to try and cure, and not merely lock up ... or punish.Now the film would be magnificent without the William Minor plotline, but that would not be the true story, and - while the threads featuring Minor look increasingly strained or implausible as the film progresses - they are indeed LARGELY TRUE! Yes, Minor DID castrate himself while locked up! Yes, the widow of the man he shot in a moment of mania (here played - again well - by Natalie Dormer) DID visit and befriend him in the end (love - who knows? but not inconceivable that there was). Yes. the man who eventually allowed for Minor to return to the USA in 1910 (for 10 more years of life there) was indeed ... Winston Churchill (as Home Secretary).Now it has to be said that - not for the first time - I found myself slightly disappointed by the later developments in the film (the first half is SPELLBINDING AND INTENSELY MOVING) - primarily because I believed the flm-makers played a little too much with their subject matter.BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY SO.The topic is such an amazing, broad, emotional and intellectually-meaningful one that of course it deserved a film. And indeed it deserved THIS film with THESE actors in it. The fact that the work descended into controversy in real life - and was even disowned by many of those involved - is of passing interest to me. They created something beautiful and warm and amazing anyway, and I love them for it. I do also appreciate their sticking rather (surprisingly) closely to the facts.For those who know the story (I did) will be captivated by the re-creation of it; while those who do not know it will - if there is any justice and reason left in this world - have their eyes opened by it in every possible way.",The Professor and the Madman

31,skepticskeptical,Quirky Story,7,17 February 2020,"The Professor and the Madman is likely to interest only logophiles and geeks. In some ways, it´s the story of OCD, and what men will do in a quest for completion. Sean Penn´s performance is truly outstanding as the ¨madman¨ wracked with guilt over a crime which was itself a result of equally guilt-ridden, phantasmagoric delusions. He came to believe that he was being pursued by a soldier whom he had harmed (branding him with a ´D´ for ´deserter´ on his face) during the war. Ultimately, it appears that he has gone nuts as a result of profound regret for all of what he did during his military service. As for Mel Gibson, he is pretty convincing as the Scottish autodidact and polyglot who somehow persuaded Oxford to allow him to head up the massive dictionary project.I would characterize this as an intellectual film, as there is lots to think about here, including the distinction between criminals and the criminally insane, the role of psychiatry in ¨treating¨ such persons, and of course some critical perspectives of academia and bureaucratic institutions more generally.Action flick aficionados will likely be bored to tears, as the only signs of violence are the branding and what appear to be holes drilled into the poor madman´s head as a part of the new ¨more invasive¨ treatments of which he was made the victim. For history buffs, there is much to like in this period piece. Plenty of grist for the mills of psychiatry critics/skeptics as well.",The Professor and the Madman

Where were the awards at?I didn't think a film about the creation of the dictionary could be so engaging. It held my interest throughout, such was the effective way it portrayed the humanity in the characters and the real-life challenges of those involved.The performances by Gibson, Penn and Marsan certainly elevated this above the average biopic or historical fare. Hell, it even made me want to casually flick through a dictionary and learn new words!At its heart, it's a film about friendship and redemption. It explores these themes well, while maintaining an engaging narrative about the dictionary itself. Definitely recommend for those into historical true stories, or who are fans of Penn or Gibson.",The Professor and the Madman
33,MrDHWong,Takes an otherwise improbable subject for onscreen treatment and turns it into something surprisingly entertaining,7,2 July 2020,"The Professor and the Madman is a biographical drama film based on the non-fiction book ""The Surgeon of Crowthorne"" by Simon Winchester. Starring Mel Gibson and Sean Penn in the leading roles, it takes an otherwise improbable subject for onscreen treatment and turns it into something surprisingly entertaining.In 1872 in London, retired US Army doctor William Chester Minor (Sean Penn) is put on trial for the murder of an innocent man but is later found not guilty by reason of insanity and is sent to Broadmoor Mental Asylum. Meanwhile in Oxford, Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson) is given the monumental task of overseeing and editing a collection of every word used in the English language. In an attempt to aid him in this difficult assignment, Murray sends out written appeals to as many English speakers as possible around the world to contribute their own definitions of words. One of these appeals finds its way to Broadmoor, which Minor comes into possession of and decides to send in over 10,000 entries, some of which are of incredibly obscure and rarely used words. Stunned by these unique contributions, Murray decides to meet with Minor and the two form an unlikely partnership in creating what would later become the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.On paper, the origins of the first English dictionary ever conceived sounds like it would never work as a film in the broadest of terms. However, thanks to the efforts of the great acting from its two leads and the proper treatment of its historical subject matter, ""The Professor and the Madman"" succeeds on screen for the most part. Throughout the film, we are reminded how large the English language truly is and how every contribution counts towards us gaining a better understanding of the importance of expanding our vocabularies. While I wouldn't say it's essential to have an unyielding love of etymology (the study of words) like I do, I believe it certainly comes in handy when watching something like this. Personally, I'm part of that niche audience who likes films about historical events no matter how overlooked they are so I can't really speak for all potential viewers out there. With that in mind though, I think there is enough for casual filmgoers to appreciate that shouldn't bore them too much.Director Farhad Safinia, who previously collaborated with Mel Gibson in 2006's ""Apocalypto"", juggles the two intersecting plotlines of a schizophrenic doctor and an Oxford professor with varying degrees of success. He chooses to juxtapose the character of Dr. Minor, whose brilliant mind has been permanently damaged by his civil war PTSD, with that of the steadfast Professor Murray, who has a strong determination to complete what he has been assigned with, and this combination of conflicting personalities is what drove things along for me. The anticipation of knowing that these two will eventually meet and decide to work together makes for an intriguing story and had me curious as to how it will turn out. There were times, though, where it felt like moments of sensationalism were added in simply for entertainment purposes rather than as a means to advance the plot. For example, there were some long and drawn out scenes involving Dr. Minor's collapsing mental state that felt unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the story. Thankfully these weren't too frequent but they still left an unfavourable impression on me and likely anyone else who might be watching.Both Sean Penn and Mel Gibson played their roles convincingly and had solid onscreen chemistry with one another. Their personal lives aside, I still think the two of them are great actors capable of holding the viewer's attention even through some of the most exposition laden of scenes. Penn has always had a knack for playing mentally unstable characters capable of bouts of impulsiveness whereas Mel Gibson has often shone as reserved individuals whose unpredictable nature may or may not be acted upon. This film uses their talents to its advantage and it comes as a surprise that this is the first time the two have starred alongside each other as their interactions felt uncannily natural to watch. I wouldn't mind seeing more films with these two actors in the future should they ever choose to work together again.Overall, while casual viewers may be put off by the concept of a film about the origins of the dictionary, I think there should be a select few out there who will appreciate the efforts in bringing such an important but neglected historical event to the big screen. It's easy to take for granted the language that over 20% of the world's population speaks but it's nice to know that a film like this exists to help show us that it can still make for something entertaining. I do wonder, however, if there will be a spiritual sequel involving the creation of the Thesaurus. I guess we'll have to wait and see/view/perceive/observe/watch...I rate it 7/10",The Professor and the Madman
34,ridi-arahan,Relationships can sometimes come from some odd places; the ones we rarely looked towards,8,28 December 2020,"What worked:
performances by the lead actors; it's hard to ignore the stellar performances by Sean Penn and Mel Gibson, both equally par on their characters, and also resembling that Penn had larger scope in his character.the real story; what makes it even more interesting is the movie is based on the real story and is quiet enjoyable and entertainingWhat did not work:
Screenplay; I think the negative reviews from the critics come from the lack of congruency and consistency in the story telling, which is not as horrible as it is made out to be. But we must acknowledge that the movie shifted its narrative from the mission of the genius mind to the emotional and sentimental value of one of the lead. The movie then geared towards his mental health issues, the affection and finally towards his redemption and release. Maybe it's during this transition of the movie that the viewers lose the slight focus from the main agenda of the movie . On the contrary , maybe the movie was not trying to glorify their work but was trying to focus on the humane aspect, friendship, salvation and the love.

36,bbewnylorac,Great effort to make a movie about a very unlikely topic,7,19 May 2019,"A film about the creation of the Oxford Dictionary sounds like a very boring idea. Luckily, one of the key contributors in 19th Century England, in real life, was a deranged surgeon, a veteran of the US Civil war called Chester Minor. Dr Minor was imprisoned indefinitely at the notorious Broadmoor asylum - and lucky not to be executed - after his paranoid delusions (probably caused by PTSD) caused him to shoot dead an innocent man one night in London. Dr Minor thought the man was out to get him, when in fact he was just walking down the street. Sean Penn makes a great fist of playing Dr Minor, as an almost irretrievably damaged man. In several brief flashbacks, we see Dr Minor performing amputations and even brandings in his years of Civil War service. At the asylum, Dr Minor is treated with great respect and kindness by the resident psychiatrist, who encourages him to take on a project - reading books to create definitions for the new dictionary. The offer is much appreciated by the dictionary's editor, a Scot played by Mel Gibson, whose perfectionism, and the sheer scope of the task, means he's unlikely to meet the ambitious deadlines of his own editors. It's only later on that Gibson realises that one of his key contributors is ''mad'' and incarcerated at Broadmoor ""at Her Majesty's Pleasure'' for murder. Gibson has a good eye for visual effects and poetry. I loved the settings, acting and design of this production. The script is great. However the film goes on too long. We're expected to believe that the wife of the stranger that Minor killed - a poor London mother of many children - visited Minor many times and even kissed him. It just doesn't make sense to me. I actually switched off the movie at this point as being too far-fetched. The mother character was also too doe-eyed and melodramatic. It didn't detract, however from my enjoyment of the earlier scenes. Sean Penn brings great compassion to his character - who wouldn't go made if they'd spent years as a field surgeon in the Civil War? It makes a good case that working on a project greater than oneself - a pioneering dictionary - can give even the most broken man self-respect, joy and purpose. The movie suggests that for Dr Minor, redemption might be possible. Maybe at one stage he could have even been released. However if you read about what happened to him later in his life, it's not a happy ending, which is sad.",The Professor and the Madman

Mel Gibson is beardy and Scottish. Sean Penn is an incomprehensible mess.Natalie Dormer is apparently incapable of aging over the several decades in which the film is set, and Jennifer Ehle is entirely unnecessary.Steve Coogan is a nice addition, and Stephen Dillane gives the most intriguing and nuanced performance, as a well-meaning phrenologist quack unintentionally doing terrible harm.The movie has a cheap, flat, made-for-British-TV look about it, with not a single memorable shot in the whole thing. The script is poor. The editing is confusing. It's a half hour too long and it drags. The attempts at building tension and drama and emotion are cliched and hamfisted. The Oxford 'bad guys' are about at the level of Scooby Doo villains.For all that, it's still somehow a watchable movie - if only just, and only just the once.

Enter Dr. William Minor who is in an insane asylum for killing the wrong husband of the woman he was sleeping with. Dr. Minor finds a way to provide numerous words for Murray's task and he also shows a way to make the process simpler. In the meantime Dr. Minor still feels tremendous guilt over the wrongful death and offers his pension from the U.S. Army to compensate the widow Eliza Merrett (Natalie Dormer) for her loss.This movie isn't so much about how the dictionary comes about, but more about the friendship between Murray and Dr. William Minor. Also we see that Mrs. Merrett slowly comes to forgive Dr. Minor and may be falling ln love with him. Because of Dr. Minor's contributions to the Dictionary work, Murray tries to get him partial credit for the work. This is denied.The acting all around is first rate, but one must listen carefully due to the accents involved as many characters talk low and fast. The pace is excellent and we are fully engaged. I am not familiar with Natalie Dormer, but she outdid her performance, and she is pretty, too. (Took you long enough to get that in) An Oscar for Sean Penn? Hmmm.......possible.Notables: Jennifer Ehie as Ada Murray, James Murray's wife; Eddie Marsan as Officer Munci who acted as a go-between with Dr. Minor and Mrs. Merrett; Henry Bradley as Loan Gruffudd, Murray's research assistant; Charlie Hall as Jeremy Irvine also a research assistant; Stephen Dillland as Dr. Richard Brayne, Dr. Minor's doctor; Steve Coogan as Frederick James Furnival as Murray's biggest supporter on the Oxford Board and he approached Murray to do the job even though Murray had no academic degrees.A very good story of how the Oxford English Dictionary came about with major inroads to the relationship between James Murray and Dr. Minor and a possible love interest with Mrs. Merrett.

The stellar cast is very much responsible for this unexpected success. For starters. Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime (it's gonna be hard for him to top this one off).

This has a great cast of actors but the casting is terrible. Some of the scenes are laughable for their over earnest attempt to be period correct. This movie also has a lot of plot point elements that should be interesting but aren't which you can only blame on the directing. Too many elements and too many messages and all told in the most banal way. The costume design and production sets are well done but then why wouldn't they be considering how many films, and series have been made about this time period just in the past few years. I really wanted to like this movie but half way thru I was too bored for words. I also felt like I'd been bludgeoned by victorian era nerds. There's just too many historical messages they're trying to get across both clumsily and 'ham handed'. 1) the story hinges on sympathy for penn's character. Fail. Epic fail. 2) the story hinges on sympathy for mel gibson's character. Fail. The story is cliche. To make it a dramatic piece they of course have to make the main character struggle against great adversities but they never quite make it relatable and clear how difficult it was to make a dictionary, or what real adversities he had to deal with.
It could be done but it wasn't in this movie. Similarly they never quite make it relatable and clear how backward psychiatry was in the victorian period. It can be done and it has been done before on film but not in this film. 3) the story hinges on sympathy for natalie dormer's character. Fail. Her performance was wonderful to watch but I wonder if she knew how comical she looked in different scenes with regard to the context of the story. We only see her a few times but we're expected to believe that she makes this great transition in every scene throughout the movie. I know that they're dumbing down films for audiences but this is a bit too far. My advice to everyone behind this production, go back to film school and pay attention this time. I predict that this movie will be a flop and the backers will claim it's a film genre not in favor by the audience today but that's nonsense. If it was a well told, well cast, well acted story, audiences wouldn't hesitate plopping down $15 to see it.Here's one not in the movie: definition of twiat - an adjective; little used phrase for stupidity or complete ignorance. Most commonly used by the celts to remove the obviously undesirable strands of rna/dna from the gene pool by breeding.

54,ilovesaturdays,"Oh, for the love of words!",9,24 July 2020,"Sometimes, you don't need words to describe your feelings, while other times a correct and succinct word can convey so much emotion. This is a movie for all those who love words and language. There have been so many times when the use of a rare or obscure word by people has brought a smile on my face, just like the one you get when you remember an old friend! Clearly, I also love language and knowing that it has played a very important role in human evolution has made it all the more dear to me. This movie celebrates the lives of lexicographers who put an enormous amount of effort in cataloging and researching each and every word of a language to make it more accessible for everyone.The movie is about the genesis of Oxford English Dictionary. An autodidact, James Murray who hadn't had much of a formal education is assigned to be the head of the project because he's a genius with languages. The task is humongous and needs contributions from speakers of English from all over the world. A particularly prolific contributor is Dr. William Minor, a retired US Army Surgeon, presently in the mental asylum, who in a fit of delusion, had killed an innocent man. Both men are very passionate about their literary endeavor and slowly develop a great friendship.This is a powerful movie that illustrates how a deep passion towards a goal can bring out the best in even those who seem to be beyond redemption. The scene when Dr. Minor tells the asylum Superintendent that he should be allowed to contribute to the dictionary as he will be alright with this work is particularly poignant. Another heart-warming scene is the one between Dr. Minor and the widow Merrett where he describes to her how reading makes his demons disappear. The film also raises interesting questions about repentance, redemption and love. All the cast turned in stellar performances.

I saw two main themes in the movie: a) The madman's (Penn) crime/love/passion story and b) The creation of the dictionary. Neither of them touched my feelings.I think that the madman's story is a twisted one and I think people have polarizing opinions regarding it. However, the second theme is where I was absolutely indifferent. They have concentrated on the creation of English dictionary and presented it as one of the greatest achievements of humanity. Is it? I wonder what an average English speaking person thinks about that. For some reason, seeing 'The Professor and the Madman' reminded me of 'Amazing Grace', though the latter cares about people and the former about books.",The Professor and the Madman

The story did drag on quite a bit, however it was very intriguing and interesting to watch. Excellent acting once again by Sean Penn, who creates a believable character. As a Scotsman myself, I can spot a fake Scottish accent, sorry Mel.

A rare thing to see in today's cinema.Mostly Britishers are shown as pompous eggheads in most period movies but here there was a slight shift. Putting that aside, I think Sean Penn can never act bad, per se. I have never seen him go wrong with any character he has played. Mel Gibson's character was not multi-layered as much but was played to perfection too. Natalie Dormer, Game of Thrones fame actress did a wonderful job and showcased her true talent of acting.I was immediately attracted to the synopsis of the movie here on IMDb and I knew I would enjoy it. I not only enjoyed it but thoroughly loved it. There is no other story arcs than the one mentioned in it's description so I don't think I am delivering any spoilers.

70,PeachesIR,"Interesting, moving, maybe too sentimental",7,22 October 2019,"I did not know about the conflicts that surrounded the production of ""The Professor and the Madman,"" which may have harmed its theatrical release. Apparently, the movie was hardly marketed to the viewing public, and I missed it until it came on my streaming services. The big-name cast--Mel Gibson, Sean Penn, Stephen Dillane, etc.--caught my attention, so I watched it and really enjoyed it. It's hard to believe that Gibson and the director wanted to dissociate themselves from the finished movie, but from what I read, they had strong creative differences with the studio and didn't feel that the final product reflected their vision. It's based on the true story of the creation of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the personalities and personal sacrifices made by the men and women involved in this monumental project. Sean Penn plays Dr. William Minor, an essential volunteer contributor to the OED, who was also mentally ill and confined to an asylum (one which, as portrayed in the film, seemed rather luxurious for its era). Gibson is Professor James Murray, the Scottish editor in chief of the dictionary, who befriends Minor. The movie focuses more on Minor's heartbreaking struggles with his mental illness and treatment, and his relationship with a young widow played by Natalie Dormer, who is luminous and seems almost too angelic at times, but perhaps that was how Minor viewed her. ""The Professor and the Madman"" offers excellent acting and a rich, moving, interesting story based on real events (and seems to be rather faithful to the facts for a movie). There are some gritty, grim scenes that portray the real, horrifying situations that these individuals endured, but I was never disturbed or grossed out. One criticism is that the movie veers too far into sentimentality and romanticizing its characters' interactions, and this strained my credulity at times. It may also be a bit too long.

In short, a very well directed film, with emotionally descriptive scenes and with a cast of the first order. Do not go looking for shots, bursts of simultaneous action and rampant sex.

The task undertaken in compiling the dictionary is staggering - so that as a back drop leaves you in awe. That and the relationship between the professor and the ""mad man"" is truly a work of fiction, and coupled with forgiveness, kind men, misguided individuals and men who pursued their own agenda weaves a plot that ultimately brings a tale to light which should be more commonly known.

THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN is based on the biography by Simon Winchester, but is as exciting as any fictional story can be. The script that in any other circumstances would earn an Oscar nomination has sustained serious damage by various law suits and troubled production, which forced the director Farhad Safinia (a many time Mel Gibson collaborator) to take his name off the final cut. Yes, the film suffers from missing on the final comprehensive editing, where the rougher edges could be smoothed (and the length reduced) although as it is, there are not many faults to be found.The acting is superb, even from the supporting cast, the costumes and the times feel authentic and the valsy soundtrack from Bear McCreary is a delight. This is a spectacular story, given that is amazingly based on history.There are elements of a thriller, a love story and a buddy drama. All wrapped up nicely into a historical package.

This film was fascinating to watch as the two main characters in this film create something that some have always taken for granted.. the dictionary. Or the first edition of the original Oxford Dictionary to be precise. I liked how the film explained and described how daunting the task of collecting every single word ever spoken (even within the public domain) actually was. From the earliest usage and pronunciation of these words to the origins. This film made you feel the weight and the importance of such a task.
Where it lost me was the undercurrent of a message: REDEMPTION
The very talented Natalie Dormer plays the newly widowed Eliza Merrett whose husband was murdered at her very feet by a deranged William Chester Minor (Sean Penn) under mistaken identity. After having her life destroyed by the death of her husband, leading to prostitution to support her family. We are lad to believe that something in her psyche finds forgiveness (and possibly LOVE) with the man who murdered her husband to begin with. REALLY? THAT part of the story left me bewildered. BUT it's based on a true story so who am I to argue? Just that tiny bit of ridiculousness doesn't take away from a brilliant film with AMAZING acting.

104,TheDreadedChampion2019,PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN,7,12 May 2019,"Was very interested to see this having heard Mel Gibson bought the rights to the book on which it is based back in 1998 and had been developing it as a passion project ever since. I become even more fascinated by it having heard of all the production troubles that happened, with Mel and Director Farhad Safina suing Voltage Pictures and basically disowning the finished (or unfinished) film....But I was willing to give it a try. I thought it was an excellent film - thoroughly involving, well acted by everyone, crisp intelligent dialogue, beautifully shot, and by the end it moves you and leaves you thinking. The movie concerns the ambitious undertaking of compiling the Oxford English dictionary. Gibson plays the professor and Penn the madman, and the film examines their unusual friendship that proves to be a very fruitful partnership as well...There were some events that happen over the course of the movie that I found to be...unbelievable. Whether or not they actually happened I am not sure, but it certainly didn't ruin the movie either. I felt maybe they could have developed Penn and Gibson's relationship a bit more as well...But overall this was a solid movie. Good to see Mel Gibson can still act!",The Professor and the Madman
105,cjmoviebuff,Excellent!!,10,16 April 2019,"Didn't know anything about this movie and I thought it was really quite touching.Excellent acting from everyone involved and a historical story few of us know anything about.
Very good film.",The Professor and the Madman
106,linkogecko,An endeavour of unanticipated heft,8,21 March 2019,"Unforeseen: when a movie about people LITERALLY writing a dictionary turns out to be captivating, specially the further it strays from the actual dictionary-writing. ""The Professor and the Madman"" features Sean Penn and Mel Gibson both retaking characteristics from some of their better-known, pre-controversy roles, with Gibson going back to the ""Braveheart"" Scottish accent and Penn to the ""Dead Man Walking"" maybe-redeemable inmate murderer; resulting in a very strong on-screen chemistry.By the time this movie is released in most markets, its fame will likely stem from its legal issues which lead to Mel Gibson basically disavowing it and director Farhad Safinia doing so in full (the movie is credited to ""P.B. Shemran"", an Alan Smithee-like alias if there's ever been one). I find this decision suprising as for most of the film I could have easily bought this as a Mel Gibson-directed work. As a filmmaker, he might not have the strongest of auteurial signatures, but said signature that can most easily be defined in the depiction of gore, a fascination with language and Christian faith elements (most obvious in ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge""), definitely makes an appearance here.Not content with Gibson-like directorial decisions, the screenplay fortunately digs deeper into some topics than any Gibson script has. Penn's character's arc in particular is well-developed in creating empathy towards the mentally ill, which is still not common enough nowadays, nevermind in a time when phrenology was still a valid study. The word ""redemption"", so rare yet supposed to be the most Christian of virtues as well, gets a very strong definition with this character arc. Obsession is touched upon as well, not to Aronofsky-an levels, but still enough to be worthy of a mention.Considering the unforeseen depth of the treatment of these topics, it's truly unfortunate that there are some cases where the movie relies of the most shallow of tropes to force tension. The worst case of this is the almost-mustache-twirling-villain characters, with no depth or motive beyond antagonizing and foiling our brave heroes. One case in particular is not as tragic when a (until then) well-developed and rounded character inexplicably takes that villanous turn, at least having given us a solid base before. Additionally, the visuals suffer with some establishing shots clearly having made with inferior digital video quality, creating a jarring effect that takes you out of the movie. All in all, despite these shortcomings, ""The Professor and the Madman"" is a worthy story that goes into unanticipated and fortuitous depths, intensities, profoundities.",The Professor and the Madman

113,cammymadden,Who thought a movie about the dictionary could be so deeply profound!,9,18 June 2019,"When I heard that Gibson and Penn would be uniting to tell the story of the creation of the dictionary, I couldn't have been less excited, even more so when I discovered that Gibson would once again be yanking William Wallace's soul through the dirt in his misguided attempts at successfully pulling off a Scottish accent.However, after seeing the trailer I was certainly intrigued. So, one bored morning I decided to give this movie a shot. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The acting by everyone (apart from one side character who is the villain to Penn and Gibson's characters in this movie) was fantastic, and I felt truly moved by their performances.This movie does more that tell the origin of the dictionary, although it does manage to do that in an interesting way. This story is about redemption, love, frienship, and the terrible mental health practices that existed in the early 1900s. At times I felt pride, at others I felt digust and contempt. 'The Professor and the Madman' isn't afriad to get its hands dirty (or bloody), but it does so without over the top gore. Camera angles allow for excellent story telling, and allow all shocks to come from the sheer fact of any event, rather than from the sight of any injuries.I probably won't watch this movie again in a hurry, but I'm certainly glad I took the time to watch it in the first place.",The Professor and the Madman

It is 2 hours long and yes, it is a bit slow, but this kind of movie can't be done in any other way and it is a story, I thought, had to be told.
Penn is dynamite!! I love his acting style, where you can see his character's feelings from head to toe. He simply drew me in in every scene to the point where scenes without him in it paled in comparison.

119,harryfreakingpotter-60734,I wanted to like this,6,10 February 2021,"Let me say this right off the bat: I don't know what percentage of this film is completely accurate. With that said, some of what I say may disapprove of the real parts of the film without my knowing.I sincerely enjoyed the first half of the film. I thought it was compelling, and it was unique to see how such an outlier of society fit into something so historically positive. I especially was interested in witnessing William spiral down further into madness. The way that the filmmakers first led us on into believing him (that he wasn't insane) and then showing us his psychotic breakdown was very well done. This really gave us a different perspective through the choices of scenes. The characters were all like-able, and of course, the acting phenomenal.Yet, I didn't enjoy the second half as much. The message of the film became less clear. I suppose the message was ""We're all a little mad"", but that doesn't translate well into the story of a murderer. Furthermore, Mrs. Merrett falling in love with William was uncomfortable to watch. It felt really odd and bizarre, especially when you consider the fact that she took all of her young children to see their father's murderer. Traumatizing much? I also really didn't understand Murray's attempts to get William released into society. The man was clearly unstable. I get that the methods of ""treatment"" he was receiving were terrible, but it would've made a lot more sense to fight for a transfer right from the start.",The Professor and the Madman

As usual a film can only do so much justice for a well-written book. Given the amount of material the film gives the bare bones of the story. People who like to learn about historical figures, who had an impact on society, this film will work for you. Today they would have diagnosed Dr. W.C. Minor with PTSD rather than schizophrenia. I wish they would have made it clear that Dr. Minor was forced by army regulations in the Civil War to brand someone, because I doubt many people watching the film understand that aspect. Acting is strong... maybe at times a bit over the top... and still hard to get used to hearing Mel Gibson with a Scottish ascent. Pretty good for Hollywood considering the mindless and violent films they are doing today.",The Professor and the Madman
122,roycevenuter,Ode to the OED,9,24 February 2020,"Having read Simon Winchester's electrifying book, ""The Professor and the Madman,"" I was still overwhelmed by the cinematic victory that the movie achieves. Probably the very best that any cinematic rendition of a great book could ever achieve is a dramatic outline hitting the most salient scenes, emotions and lyrics. The makers of this film have gleaned the book, then, as Pablo Neruda might have limned, resurrected a work of art that leads in and out of the literary experience, an excitng mobius strip of wonders.

These personalities were at the top of their artistic representation, not to mention the characterization of the character and the depth of the human dimension of each.

That's the core of this fascinating movie that inextricably unites a brilliant, yet tortured mind with that of the most unlikely of allies; a widow, a security guard, and a Professor. All aligned in their belief that beyond pain, beyond suffering and beyond loss there are lessons learned. And love, even in its most simple form, can elicit an understanding of another's trespasses.Brilliant performance by Sean Penn.

I agree that there is a great deal of forced melodrama, as well as too many convenient coincidences to further the plot. I also agree that the visuals could have been better handled. However, none of these things can stop us from thoroughly enjoying it.First of all, the story itself is very interesting. I don't think there are many films (Hollywood or non-Hollywood) that examine so closely the challenges and the hard work that comes with the writing of a dictionary (in this case, the monumental Oxford Dictionary of the English Language). In addition, the film should be commended for the manner in which approaches contrasting themes like insanity versus logic, redemption versus damnation, open-mindedness versus prejudice etc. Both Gibson and Penn give extremely solid, if not powerful, performances and so does the rest of the cast, even if the script sometimes feels noticeably weak. Despite the cliches, the dialogue is quite convincing and this is how we get real-looking, three-dimensional characters to whose ordeal and suffering we can relate.In short, ""The Professor and the Madman"" is a very satisfying and enjoyable film. It is certainly worth watching, if not for the story, then for the excellent acting skills of Mel Gibson and Sean Penn.",The Professor and the Madman

While I agree that some of Mel Gibson's previous drunken antics are not something I support, I CAN and WILL support forgiving him for them, and will not banish and blacklist him for eternity in the way that liberal film critics seem to have (btw, I'm very liberal). Likewise, Mr. Penn seems to have infuriated a variety of conservative elements in his travels, but again, he should not be banished for eternity by them either.

There are certainly better movies, and, yes, the movie should probably have included more content about the effort of finding the words for the dictionary instead of concentrating so much on the characters. However, that was the intention of the movie, and the choice taken. Trying to accomplish both things would have resulted in a longer movie, and it could have been quite difficult and probably confusing. I didn't find the movie slow or boring at all.

And that is what happened to me, lead and supporting roles were so good, I actually ""woke up"" after the story was finished.
Maybe it's intentionally maybe not, but the language used and the sentences formed in this movie seemed to be a message to
the viewer stating the more words you know the more efficiently you could express yourself. Use one word instead of a whole sentence to state your meaning, but maybe that just me;)
CONS:
Like I said beautiful story and wonderful acting but,
In my case there was a small annoyance, like the camera shaking when great dialogs were performed.
The dialogs seemed therefore chaotic and not stand-fast when it was meant to be stand-fast making the emotion of that moment
fleeting away quickly, but that is my pet peeve.
The story is a beautiful one, people who made a difference should not be forgotten.
The wonderful acting is immersive although you get out of it quickly, because of the handheld camera.
Therefore I give this movie a 7.",The Professor and the Madman

I even started watching something else on my iPad I thought would grab me more. The iPad was out of juice and died. I was going to change the channel, but next thing you know I was sucked in and watched the whole thing. it was the same thing as happened when I read the book. It just sucked me right in. The book had more about the dictionary, which did not diminish it, but it's no surprise they had to have less of that in the movie. This story is remarkable.

Just enjoy it ! This was a passion project for Gibson, Penn, and Safinia and they were screwed by the production companies.This is why I almost never look at critic reviews.

The men's lives who were portrayed in this film are owed a debt of gratitude for their service as the English language is ever evolving and growing. At the time these men undertook the task it was a monumental task of incredible proportions. All they had were small pages of old letters, documents, or books that were long out of print that had old words used only a few times. These men went through all the records they could find and established the English language and it's vast vocabulary the best they could so that we have what is available today. They created what is known as the oxford dictionary which is the most complete English dictionary in the world. The acting is very well done and on par with the time period.

I saw this movie with zero knowledge of what it was about. I was scrolling
thru movies to watch and saw Mel Gibson and Sean Penn, whom are two
of my all time favorite actors. So, I decided, ok.. let's watch this movie.

Mr Penn didn't seem to overact and Mr Gibson pulled off a really good Scottish accent, (better than his Oscar winning movie anyway).
Most of the acting was well done, the story was magnificent. The scenery for the time period was good, the dress code too was spot on. There was a lapse though when over a time period everyone aged except Mr Gibsons children, but that is being picky and getting away from the the story.

Therefore, I will say nothing about Mr. Penn.The movie is terrific. I liked almost everything about the film, and have only one quibble. Ms. Dormer's character is supposed to be a poor, widow; yet she constantly wears a different outfit of high quality (as does her children) in every scene. Yes, I know the Penn character sends her money, but he's not exactly rolling in cash himself as he's in asylum.The acting is fine, the story (which is true) is well told, and it is one of the best movies I've seen this year.

But he took his role in this film to a different level and couldn't have been done any better by anyone else. Mel Gibson's role was just as powerful and I don't think anyone could have done it better than him and goes to prove that Mel can still play a leading role and still be considered at the top of the list to make a memorable movie. Sean Penn will definitely be a contender to win another oscar and in my opinion, he should win it again because I highly doubt he'll be surpassed this year by another actor.

I think he worked on it quite a bit, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounded (at least to my American ear) playing James Murray. I wasn't sure how a movie about the creation of the first Oxford dictionary would be interesting. Little did I know that the American Civil War doctor (played by Sean Penn) actually played an important role in its creation. I thought Sean Penn stole the show, what a phenomenal acting performance. Being able to go from an intelligent, well-spoken doctor to a madman throughout the movie was a joy to watch. I have to call out Bear McCreary's score also. I found it such a beautiful score that fit very well into the movie, and as a stand alone score, it is also equally a pleasure to listen to. I cannot oversell this move enough.

The bad reviews are obviously a backlash to personal opinions about the personal lives of Sean Penn and Mel Gibson, both of whom deliver Oscar-worthy performances. Actually, the entire cast, set and costume design, and script are all top notch. To successfully take the story of the creation of the Oxford American dictionary and make it this engaging is high art. This is the rare film that one can describe as intelligent.The bottom line is that these critics need to separate the quality of the art from the the politics and personal lives of the creators. Woody Allen is experiencing the same thing but unfortunately, in my humble opinion, he is not delivering the goods.On a final note, I found watching this film with the CC on ensured that I didn't miss one bit of dialogue!

One review I saw seemed to be desperately hunting for something, anything to criticise, no matter how incidental to the story. Perhaps there are just not enough explosions, car chases and action heroes for modern taste. What's wrong with a true story, accurately and engagingly told, about amazing and important events from history?At the heart of this movie is the heroic project that produced the Oxford English Dictionary. But the film brings it to life by telling the story of the people who made it all happen. I had the advantage of previously reading the book, The Surgeon of Crowthorne, on which the movie is largely based. However, the movie brings it to life that a written summary can never do.
The acting was superb, with a cast studded with well-known actors. The sets, cinematography and editing created a sense of the atmosphere of the time. Perhaps most important of all, the script shows how the characters develop over time, revealing how humanity succeeds in the end.",The Professor and the Madman

This film further surprises with unconvention. We see a psychiatrist who truly believes his misguided treatment is a mission of mercy. We aren't required to demonize him in order to reject his methods any more than we are expected to reject a man with mental health issues who murders another man in front of his wife. There are a few villains, but the dark cynicism that stars in so much entertainment these days is shoved aside by realism and hope.Sean Penn may be type-cast as a tortured soul, but he does it so, so well.

The use of language, the play on words, and the overall intelligence of the writing is brought to life by the actors and actresses who deliver this tale in a way that moves the mind and soul as well as heart all at once. Gibson, you're back and should remain doing period style dramas. I loved hearing him play a Scot again. Penn as always is a delight to watch as he inherits everything his characters are. I have adored Dormer since her days on ""The Tudors"" and she again delights the screen with her simple yet striking beauty and shows us all the power of forgiveness.A must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of the beauty of friendship, love, kindness and humanity.

Sean Penn might be the best actor to portray vulnerability ever. Mel Gibson is on his A-game as well with a portrayal of a man who wishes to do right by his wife and his friend, Penn's character. The supporting cast is top notch. The widow, the security guard, superintendent doctor and so on. This is a film everyone involved believed in... And for good reason. It's a shame nobody else did. This is not an easy watch, but it isn't a brutal one either. The director and cinematographer really did a wonderful job of using architecture as a character in this film.

This incredible true story highlights the captivating and tragic friendship between two brilliant men. Where words become a code of friendship and the thin line between beauty and madness.The Professor and the Madman is based off a noval by Simon Winchester. The story tells of Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson) who is charged with drafting the first ever Oxford dictionary of the English language. Murray, knowing the enormity of the task, appealed to all English speaking people via a letter skillfully placed within the covers of books asking them to help gather every word, definition and date they came across, inviting them to send their words by post.William Chester Minor (Sean Penn), a former American military surgeon, who mistakenly killed an innocent man due to his schizophrenic delusions of being chased and haunted by a man from his past, was condemned to living in an asylum, after being declared insane by the English courts. Minor, receiving a book from the asylum guards as a Christmas gift, found the appeal made by Professor Murray, thus beginning a whirlwind of brilliance, maddness, forgiveness, friendship and love.
The ""professional"" critics loathed this film for being ""off rhythm"" and ""slow"", and Mel Gibson not promote the film at all due to legal battles.
The beauty of this film is in the storytelling and the true to life tonal cinematic contrasts that keep this film perfectly off-balance. There's the impenetrable darkness that surrounds Minor's story that can be seen and felt in the film. Watching Penn reach into his abilities to project the pain of a burning mind held captive by mental illness was truly an honor to watch. The other side of the story is sunnier, which also can be seen and felt with Murray trying to balance being a father, husband and editor, as well as a man of God battling his way through the doubt of Oxford leadership.Its truly a shame this film didn't get the credit it deserves.

Few of us, academics or otherwise, will achieve the satisfaction of knowing that you have contributed to something as everlasting as the Oxford English Dictionary. But we can all live in the hope that we can move things forward in our lives if only just a smidgen. Look that last word up in the Oxford English to understand how it differs from a regular dictionary. It helped me understand the film in that I was ignorant of the difference until a month or so before watching it.

So much happens in the first 8 minutes alone! This is the kind of movie I miss-brisk, emotional, reflective, and documenting the larger than life.

A fellow author recommended, because I wouldn't have watched it based on the trailer. It's an exquisitely crafted work. The messages of redemption, love, friendship, and forgiveness were unabashedly demonstrated by the award-worthy acting of Mel Gibson and Sean Penn. We're still talking about it this morning. The film is a challenge to us authors to effect change in this world, not just our circle of believers. To not be afraid of the impossible, but understand the cost. Then remembering that true friendship sees past the challenges to the heart of the person--seeing who God created them to be.

373,elzaar,Poor Critic reviews are strongest indication to Watch?,9,24 February 2021,"I didn't even know this movie existed until I was scrolling for something to watch. After watching I was curious for more information and found one scathing critical review after another. Then I saw that actual people not being paid to write a review gave it awesome reviews. There might be a clue there.This is a very good film. Gibson portrays a character who is pretty much what I would expect the lead in creating a massive book of words would be. He is fascinated by words. Why this somehow offends people who make their living with words eludes me, but Gibson plays the role brilliantly.Sean Penn plays an insane man suffering from PSTD resulting from his time in the Civil War. He goes from rages, to despondent, to brilliant, with phases being a normal human with normal emotions and desires in between. Apologies to supposed movie critic experts who feel this is over-acting, but this is what an extreme case of PTSD, possibly with other mental issues thrown in, looks like. Penn feels like a guy who is sick, terrified, remorseful, and conflicted who fines a sense of purpose and value through his love of words.The scenes between Penn and Gibson are well done and touching. It isn't much of a spoiler, but the two of them tossing words back and forth is just the sort of thing people that fascinated by words might do.It's as if the critics are upset to see actors portraying people as normal people. The supporting actors have moments when they are supportive or understanding, they have moments when they aren't. Wow. Like, how real. You mean to tell me a spouse can be both supportive one day and frustrated and fed up on another in a span of years? Stunning.This isn't a story of people charging down halls and throwing doors open in triumph. There aren't times when someone has a life-changing epiphany with the music rising and crashing in crescendo. There are no implausible romantic breakthroughs or happily ever afters.
There shouldn't be. This is a fascinating story about real people who come from real backgrounds who each have great personal challenges to overcome while dealing with other people with different agendas. If it sounds a lot like real life, that is because it is.It seems that the social programming machine that is Hollywood must just have it out for people who won't conform to their expectations. Actors, writers, directors were once celebrated for actually being artists. Now it feels more than ever like a high school popularity contest with in crowds and unpopular folks. Ironic that a movie about societal outcasts struggling against a system that doesn't want to accept them even as it needs them, has to deal with the same hypocrisy in real life. Perhaps that is why Gibson and Penn chose to do it.A final note that to me sums up how desperate critics were to pan this thing. They are upset that a historical event that takes place primarily at Oxford isn't actually filmed at Oxford. Perhaps they haven't noticed that most films with a plot occurring in Seattle, New York, LA or wherever are actually filmed in Canada - other than the shots done on a sound stage in Hollywood, I mean.If today's supposed movie experts say a movie is bad.

I have to state that the performances of the main characters navigated the heaviness of the subject with significant confidence and grace.

Eddie Marsan who I love acting but his care and love with his relationship with Minor as his prison warden. So easy being the other way. Natalie Dormer wow what a performance.

Sadly, it is my opinion that the legal battle that ensued when the film was taken from Mel Gibson prior to completion is the reason for the cold shoulder.

I watched the preview, and was intrigued by the characters and a glimpse of the performances by Mel Gibson and Sean Penn and thought it might be interesting. After watching this film, I had to check back and read the reviews because I was absolutely stunned about my reaction to the performances by Gibson and Penn, never being a particulary big fan before, and how mesmerized I was by the storyline, the writing, etc. I just simply thought it was spectacular film and I couldn't remember the last time I felt as though I would review a film 10/10. I was curious to see if this film experience has the same affect on others. At first I checked a few of the critic Reviews, expecting to see Oscar worthy accolades for everything. Needless to say I was shocked when one after another review provided only negative remarks about the actors, writing, directing, blah, blah blah.

The script, the settings, costume design, the cinematography, the music, the pace of the film and most of all, the outstanding acting performances hold this film together. I saw one braindead critic say Penn was overacting but clearly that critic has no empathy or understanding of the human condition. Imagine being a person involved in a terrible war, having to brand someone and then later committing murder thinking it was the same person coming to torment them and then having to deal with the guilt as well as the dead man's wife and 6 children who were starving due to this being set in a time long before the welfare state. Clearly this critic (and his ilk couldn't) as it seems he thought Sean Penn seemed a bit too sad at times and didn't play the role as one whose favourite programmeis likely to be Thunderbirds might expect. No doubt with Gibson and Fox in the cast, there is a need to run this film down by some people ever eager to cast the first stone along with a few boulders to boot.
