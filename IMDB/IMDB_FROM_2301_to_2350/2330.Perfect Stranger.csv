0,SnoopyStyle,Mostly boring whodunnit and bad twist ending,4,9 May 2014,"Rowena Price (Halle Berry) is an investigative journalist who quits after her story gets pulled by a powerful politician. Her childhood friend Grace has some information on ad exec Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis). She's a mess and claims to have had an online affair with Hill. She ends up dead, and Rowena starts investigating Hill with help from friend co-worker Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi). She goes undercover with a fake name as a new temp in Hill's company.It tries to be a noir thriller. It's slow. Sometimes it creates a nice quiet atmosphere but mostly it is slow and boring. Halle Berry never really achieves the undercover journalist feel. It's too bland and looks too good. The internet chat is also boring as heck. There is way too much boring static computer work with the computer voice.It's a lot of whodunnit but I'm not sure if I care. Bruce Willis doesn't have enough natural menace but he does an OK job. It just takes too long, and there isn't more sense of danger. And the twist ending is horrible. The investigation is boring to begin with but the ending reduces it to nothingness.",Perfect Stranger
1,claudio_carvalho,Everybody Has a Secret,7,21 October 2007,"In New York, the investigative reporter Rowena Price (Halle Berry) sees her scoop about a gay senator spiked by her editor. She quits her job in the newspaper and meets with her childhood friend Grace (Nicki Aycox) by chance in the subway. Grace tells Ro that she had just been dumped by the powerful and wealthy owner of the greatest New Yorker advertising agency, Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), and she was threatening to tell his wife about their affair. When Grace is found dead, Harrison becomes Rowena's prime suspect. With the support of her hacker friend and former colleague Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi), Ro is hired for a temporary work in Harrison's agency to get close to the executive and investigate his life.""Perfect Stranger"" has a good story, with a surprising twist; the lead cast has the names of Halle Berry, Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi; unfortunately, the screenplay does not work well since it does not create an empathy of the viewer with the characters, which have dirty secrets. In the end, this film is a good and forgettable entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Estranha Perfeita"" (""The Perfect Stranger"")",Perfect Stranger
2,kosmasp,Thriller wanna be,4,18 April 2007,"A thriller with Halle Berry and Bruce Willis. Although at least the latter seems ridiculously miscast. Giovanni Ribisi is underused, so there's not much left. The story maybe, but even that has been done better before.Something bad will happen in this movie and then it will be the case of why did the person do this, but more importantly, can you nail that person? And no I'm not talking about the director of the movie here ... ;o) Seriously though, you know the drill, if you've watched at least one other thriller in your life (there's always something bad going to happen) and you won't miss too much, if you don't watch this movie!",Perfect Stranger
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"Just remember, this cost $60m to make.",6,27 August 2018,"Unlike many of the reviewers on here, I quite liked the main body of the film. I love murder mysteries, suspense, whodunits, so it's always nice when a big budget mystery comes out.TV mysteries are always the best, Agatha Christie penned mysteries are definitely the best, you are given clues, taken up blind alleys, but if you're smart, you can work out the puzzle. The problem with Perfect Stranger, is that the ending feels like it was tagged on because nobody was smart enough to come up with an intelligent, logical conclusion, that actually made sense. I felt robbed by the twist, the whole conclusion made absolutely no sense. The closing twenty minutes almost made me feel like I'd switched channels, which is a shame, because the build up was really smart, I enjoyed the tension, I liked the way the story was going, the eye pictures, drops etc, it was clever, then we get the rug pulled from underneath our feet.Halle Berry did a great job, Bruce Willis was also very good, in a very different role for him. Disheartening, but with the likes of Gone Girl and Girl on a Train the genre is still alive.Watchable, 6/10",Perfect Stranger
4,lee_eisenberg,"Errol Brown, RIP",4,13 May 2015,"James Foley's ""Perfect Stranger"" has an interesting plot but comes out flat. This story of a reporter going after a businessman gets severely weakened by the blatant product placement. Halle Berry and Bruce Willis starred in better movies before this (she in ""Bulworth"" and ""Monster's Ball"", he in ""The Fifth Element"" and ""The Sixth Sense"") have starred in better movies since this (she in ""Movie 43"", he in ""Moonrise Kingdom"").The truth is, I wish that there were movies based on books. For example, Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Years of Rice and Salt"" needs to get filmed. There also needs to be a movie about the 1811 slave uprising in Louisiana.Oh, and Errol Brown? He was the lead singer of Hot Chocolate, which did ""You Sexy Thing"" (played during the fashion show in ""Perfect Stranger""). He recently died.",Perfect Stranger
5,rmax304823,Routine Mystery.,4,27 April 2008,"Halle Berry is a reporter whose best friend is murdered. She pursues the case over the objections of her editor, who finally fires her. (If she were a cop, this would be the scene in which she hands over her gun and badge.) With the help of a friend at the paper, Giovanni Ribisi, she goes undercover and is hired by the prime suspect, Bruce Willis, a nasty executive at the firm where Berry's friend last worked, a guy who exudes menace and embodies a kind of serpentine lechery. It's a pretty tough slog for the viewer. The writers have done what they could but not much of interest happens, despite some trumped-up suspense plug-ins. Red herrings abound. Everybody turns out to have secrets of one sort or another and they are uncovered, one by one, except for those of the murderer.Halle Berry looks delicious, though she is no longer the cherub of yesteryear. That's not necessarily a disadvantage. The part calls for a fully grown and determined woman, not a cutie pie. Her acting is seasoned and pedestrian. Giovanni Ribisi is a good nerd but occupies so much screen time that we KNOW he's more than just a helping hand. Bruce Willis is toggled into his minimalist mode, which renders him more ominous but less human than in his usual action movies. I prefer him dashing along steel girders with a pistol in hand.The ending calls for a suspension of disbelief uncommon outside of frank delusions. I don't know why this is so dull. Maybe -- at least in part -- because no one has yet found a way to make participation in internet chat exciting.",Perfect Stranger
6,blanche-2,not good,5,7 April 2014,"Halle Berry stars with Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi in ""Perfect Stranger,"" a 2007 film directed by James Foley.Berry plays Rowena Price, a writer who goes by the name of David Shane and finds salacious stories for her newspaper. When a particularly hot story is quashed by her boss, she quits. On her way home, she runs into a childhood friend, Grace (Nicki Aycox), whom she's not too happy to see. Grace gives her a bunch of emails from Harrison Hill, a famous, powerful ad executive, married to money. Grace has been in a chat room with him; they finally met and had a hot time together. Grace takes the emails but seems annoyed by the whole encounter.When Grace winds up dead, Rowena gets a temp job in Hill's office and, with the help of a friend from her old job, Miles (Ribisi), she starts investigating Hill, whom she believes killed Grace.Other than the fact that Berry is a knockout, one would walk away from this film asking how she won an Oscar and who wrote and directed this thing. The script is all over the place (for good reason - it turns out there were three different endings) and it's badly directed. For some reason, it also has a cheap feel to it.Kathleen Chalfont plays Grace's mother - she's a well respected, brilliant stage actress who has about one minute of screen time, and it was fun to see Patti D'Arbanville again as someone who works for Hill.Bruce Willis and Berry exhibited no real chemistry. Willis in this film is 52; Berry is around 41 but could pass for early thirties. She seems a little young for him.We really don't get to know much about these characters -- we pick up pieces of Rowena's past, but we don't learn enough about anyone else to make us care. Actually we don't really care all that much about Rowena except to see her next outfit.Disappointing. Given the talent involved, this should have been better.",Perfect Stranger
7,edwagreen,The Imperfection of Perfect Stranger **,5,23 February 2008,"Something goes terribly awry in this film.Bruce Willis seems to have really aged in this film. He could have played the father of Halle Berry. He's ruthless, cunning and a real stinker, but what's really going on with him, if anything.There is a surprising excellent supporting performance by Giovanni Ribisi. The latter is an up and coming thespian who will be walking down the aisle one day with an Oscar in his hand. Trouble is that his acting talents are wasted here due to the end of this unconvincing plot.The film starts off well. A reporter has the goods on a gay senator but everything gets dropped due to politics. Angry and embittered, the reporter played by a devilish Halle Berry, resigns but soon finds herself caught up in the murder of a childhood friend. The latter was carrying on an affair with advertising executive Bruce Willis.You really don't expect Berry to turn out as the culprit. Nothing really led up to this.Berry really comes off as a monster here. Was she emulating ""Monster's Ball?"" If so, it sure doesn't work.",Perfect Stranger
8,sunwarrior13,A Techno-Thriller Without Thrills,7,1 October 2012,"Perfect Stranger is a neo-noir psychological thriller film that stars Halle Berry and Bruce Willis together with Giovanni Ribisi,Florencia Lozano, Jason Antoon and Patti D'Arbanville. It is about a hard-nosed star reporter learns who her real friends are and gets in way over her head while investigating a murder.It was directed by James Foley.Rowena is a prominent New York journalist who writes using a pseudonym to entrap some of the tri-state area's most corrupt individuals, using a network of informants, acquaintances, and digital gadgets. When her latest exposé is buried at the behest of her paper's corporate backers, she walks off the job and into a personal quagmire. Her childhood friend Grace is murdered when she threatens to reveal she's been sleeping with married advertising mogul Harrison Hill. With the help of her loyal tech expert friend Miles, she goes undercover to find the smoking gun that will indict Hill. But Rowena soon finds herself caught in a web of manipulation, deceit, and false truths as she suspects Hill of the crime.She goes undercover by posing as two highly alluring women: Katherine, a sexy temp who works within his agency, and Veronica, a seductive temptress he chats up online.Engaging in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, both Rowena and Hill begin to realize things may not be what they seem. For some people will go to great lengths to protect their secrets, even if it means risking everything.The movie would perhaps like to say something serious about the ease with which modern communications allows us to be multiple personalities, but that effort is lost in ineptitude.What's worse,despite the presence of Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, its plot is too convoluted to work, and features a twist ending that's irritating and superfluous. It suffers from being a techno-thriller without thrills.",Perfect Stranger
9,jotix100,The Hemingway daiquiri,5,9 June 2008,"This must have been a vehicle designed for Halle Berry, an actress that had her fifteen minutes of fame in ""Monster's Ball"". After all, in that film she had several things going for her, namely, her director, Marc Forster, a meaty role, and Billy Bob Thornton who showed great chemistry with Ms. Berry. Bruce Willis seems to have been an after thought since he doesn't have much to do in this film.""Perfect Stranger"" alas, is a manipulative film that doesn't make sense. As directed by James Foley, this movie asks us to stretch our imagination in believing that our heroine, who is a nasty piece of work, can do the things she does. From threatening a politician who has been involved in an unsavory situation, she goes into an overkill mode in trying to avenge the death of a childhood friend, a situation that we don't believe from one second.""Perfect Stranger"" dwells in the world of the New York media with its glossy setting, steamy sex and double entendre situations. It is also a film that shamelessly show two prominent brands, Victoria's Secret and Reebok. Then there is a question of credibility in which our heroine, who is not computer savvy is asked to get into her would be lover's computer without any knowledge in how to go about it. Also, for that matter, the case against Harrison Hill is pure fantasy as it is based on circumstantial evidence that any trial lawyer would be able to dismiss in no time.Halle Berry is a beautiful woman. That said, she shows no chemistry with her co-star Bruce Willis even in their steamier scenes. Creepy Giovanni Ribisi does another of his weird interpretations as the hacker who should have known more about his friend, but paid a dear price for not realizing who he was dealing with.",Perfect Stranger
10,dbborroughs,The kind of movie that makes you think Halle Berry's Oscar was a fluke,2,2 September 2007,"Halle Berry in a ""What were they thinking"" movie that has to have been made up on the fly or cobbled together from eight other movies. The basic plot, I'll stick with that because I don't want to try to explain the real plot, has Halle Berry investigating the murder of a friend. The trail leads to Bruce Willis as the head of a PR firm who's married and has a kinky side.Possibly as bad as Catwoman this movie is a real stinker.Everyone is in a different movie, there is no sense of whats going on and as the revelations start coming and coming and coming and you begin to realize that the reason there is no sense of whats going on is that there is no plot to make sense of. The final plot twists are of the sort that make you go-""get the *#$% out of here"" or ""What you talking' 'bout Halle"".To be fair, There's one or two tiny things that make me not sure if this is a good bad movie or a bad bad movie since it straddles the line, but its not really worth splitting hairs over so I'm leaning towards calling it a complete dirtball stinker.Avoid this one at all costs.",Perfect Stranger
11,zardoz-13,Perfectly Awful Halle Berry Flick,1,20 May 2007,"Good movie mysteries give the audience a fair chance to guess who really done it. Unfortunately, the new Halle Berry & Bruce Willis psycho-sexual murder melodrama ""Perfect Stranger"" (* out of ****), haphazardly contrived by veteran director James Foley and sophomore scenarist Todd Komarnicki, would baffle a psychic. Reportedly, Foley and Komarnicki dreamed up three endings and apparently selected the least plausible, least predictable, but by far the biggest cheat for a finale since the 1927 Agatha Christie novel ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."" Moreover, ""Perfect Stranger"" recalls two awful epics from the 1990s that swindled audiences with surprise endings. First, Rebecca De Mornay starred in a whodunit with Antonio Banderas called ""Never Talk To Strangers"" where the heroine stalked herself. Second, the Sharon Stone thriller ""Sliver"" (1993) with Tom Berenger served up an ending that defied all the clues that the filmmakers had carefully planted before they decided to give everything a fatal twist that made no sense. Indeed, the surprise ending of ""Perfect Stranger"" constitutes more of a shock than a surprise because the filmmakers have deliberately withheld crucial clues from the audience.""Perfect Stranger"" casts Academy Awarding actress Halle Berry of ""Monster's Ball"" as a beautiful but tenacious Nancy Drew investigative reporter writing for a fictitious New York City tabloid called The New York Courier. As the film opens, Rowena Price (Halle Berry) has gotten the goods on U.S. Senator Sachs (Gordon MacDonald of ""The Thin Red Line"") and threatens to expose the congressman for his illicit affair with a young male intern. The congressman pleads futilely with Rowena to abandon the story. Our heroine, however, refuses to squash her own scoop and celebrates her journalistic triumph with a friendly computer savvy colleague Miles (Giovanni Ribisi of ""The Mod Squad"") who helped her nail Sachs. Just as they are toasting their success at a nearby bar, they learn to their chagrin that the powerful senator has managed to bribe the informant and the Courier winds up pulling the story off the front page. A furious Rowena refuses to listen to her editor and storms off the paper in disgust. On the way to the subway, she encounters a friend, Grace (Nicki Aycox who played Christina Rush in ten episodes of CBS-TV's ""Cold Case"") that she has known since childhood. Grace confides in Rowena about own juicy scandal. She has been having an adulterous affair with an advertising tycoon, Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis whose fourth ""Die Hard"" movie is scheduled for a June release), and she entrusts Rowena with a treasure trove of Hill's incriminating e-mails. Predictably, Grace turns up missing not long afterward and then her slain body is discovered along with the revelation that she was pregnant. Of course, all of this happened after she told Rowena that she had planned on confronting Hill with the news about her baby. Smelling another scoop, Rowena and Miles team up, and Rowena takes a job as a temp at Hill's advertising agency.The first half of the ""Perfect Stranger"" creates a reasonable amount of suspense. Although she isn't a role model for journalists, Rowena appears sympathetic enough at the outset. She isn't afraid to pursue big targets but she plays fast and loose with ethics. Basically, she is prepared to do whatever it takes to get enough evidence to convict Hill. Bruce Willis alternates between being urbane and suspicious as Hill. Willis must have needed a paycheck to play such a routine villain. Rowena tries to seduce him in a cyberspace chat room under an assumed name. Not surprisingly, Hill gets wise about Rowena's deception and is willing to bed down with her, even though his current wife has all the money in the family and has taken him to court before for his philandering antics.The second half of ""Perfect Stranger"" differs drastically from the first. Foley and Komarnicki twist this steamy, R-rated, 110-minute escapade into incomprehensible knots with unexpected revelations that seem to occur as an afterthought. Literally, they turn everything upside down for an ending that you aren't prepared for in light of everything that had transpired from the outset. Mind you, James Foley is no slouch as a director. His films include the tricky conman movie ""Confidence"" (2003), the explosive urban shoot'em up ""The Corrupter"" (1999), the top-notch David Mamet thriller ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" (1992), and the tense father & son crime saga ""At Close Range"" (1986). Presumably, everything about Todd Komarnicki's screenplay must have been so easy to unravel that Foley decided to complicate matters and make it impossible to guess the outcome. Fans of CBS-TV's ""Crime Scene Investigation"" should keep their eyes peeled for Gary Dourdan's cameo as Berry's two-timing boyfriend. Forget it, guys, Halle doesn't bare his bodacious berries here as she did in ""Swordfish"" and her sex scenes with Willis generate none of the chemistry of ""Monster's Ball."" Since the movie takes place in an advertising setting, the filmmakers take advantage of product placement to expose audiences to ads fro Reebok, Victoria's Secret, and Heineken. Altogether, absolutely nothing about ""Perfect Stranger"" qualifies remotely as perfect.",Perfect Stranger
12,george.schmidt,Sub-par Eszterhausian schlock; one of the year's worst!,1,17 April 2007,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***PERFECT STRANGER (2007) * Halle Berry, Bruce Willis, Giovanni Ribisi, Richard Portnow, Gary Dourdan, Florencia Lozano, Nicki Aycox, Kathleen Chalfant, Daniella Van Graas, Paula Miranda, Patti D'Arbanville, Clea Lewis, Tamara Feldman, (Cameo as herself: Heidi Klum) Abysmal sub- Joe Eszterhaus' erotic thriller (no thanks to the screenplay by newcomer Todd Komarnicki based on a story by Jon Bokenkamp) ) with miscast Berry as a gritty NYC tabloid investigative journalist who goes after an advertising exec (a surprisingly one-note Willis) who may have killed her girlfriend who may have been harboring more than the secret of carrying his baby. Horrible on all counts particularly the character of Ribisi's who is supposed to be a sharp twist in the plot that is ludicrously awful and it doesn't help that Berry chews the scenery and her character is equally unlikable (including her 'twist' to her character by the film's ridiculous 'twist' ending!)

13,neil-476,Not fair to audiences,5,7 January 2009,"Who knew Halle Berry and Bruce Willis had made a film together? Not me, until I spotted the DVD of this movie.And it turned out to be a tolerable psychological thriller, with Halle Berry as a jaundiced investigative reporter on the trailer of powerful executive Bruce Willis who looks as if he may have murdered Berry's childhood friend. Or perhaps it was his wife....? With the help of her co-worker Giovanni Ribisi she sets about adopting false personalities in order to collect evidence.And so it goes, unfurling in fairly typical psychological thriller mode until......well, let's be honest, it goes to pieces. It doesn't even try to play fair with the audience and, as a result, any good work in the first 80% is completely destroyed.The cast do the best they can, I suppose. Berry is nicely decorative. Ribisi is intense, odd, sometimes funny and sometimes worrying. Willis oozes charisma but never convinces. Gary Dourdan turns up in a non-role.And a slap on the wrist for the screenwriter - if you're going to do that, you have to put some sort of justification in beforehand otherwise you are simply going to alienate your audience - in this case me. I'm so cross with you I'm not even going to look up your name to quote it here, which I would normally do. Go back to screenwriter school.",Perfect Stranger
14,Uriah43,A Good Story Plagued by Too Many Sudden Twists at the End,5,22 October 2020,"This film essentially involves a young reporter by the name of ""Rowena Price"" (Halle Berry) who had done her best to get some incriminating evidence on a popular U.S. Senator only to have her report stifled by the newspaper editor for partisan reasons. Needless to say this infuriates Rowena after all of the hard work she and a colleague named ""Miles Haley"" (Giovanni Ribisi) spent on getting the information. Left with no real idea on what to report on next she is suddenly visited by a childhood friend by the name of ""Grace Clayton"" (Nicki Aycox) who tells her of an affair she had been having with an extremely popular advertising executive named ""Harrison Hill"" (Bruce Willis) who was now refusing to return her calls. So in a fit of anger she gives Rowena enough evidence to publish an embarrassing story in the newspaper in order to humiliate him. Not long after that Grace is found dead and when Rowena finds out she becomes convinced that Harrison had something to do with it. From that point on both her and Miles become committed to gathering enough evidence to prove their case beyond any doubt. What neither of them realize, however, is that both of them are keeping secrets from each other which will ultimately have a big impact on their overall objective. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was one of those films which had good potential but was diminished by too many twists and turns at the end. I should also mention that while Halle Berry was quite attractive there were a couple of scenes which could have used a bit more passion as well. In any case, while this wasn't a great neo-noir by any means, it was sufficient for the time spent and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Perfect Stranger
15,anaconda-40658,Imperfect Stranger.,5,3 June 2015,"Perfect Stranger (2007): Dir: James Foley / Cast: Halle Berry, Bruce Willis, Giovanni Ribisi, Nicki Aycox, Florencia Lozano: Flawed yet entertaining thriller about identities particularly those over the Internet chat lines. Halle Berry plays a journalist who goes undercover in an attempt to expose an advertising giant whom she believes is responsible for a friend's murder. Director James Foley manages some suspense yet humour comes off as corny. Foley has made such films as The Chamber and The Corrupter. Structure is pure formula with an ending that will either surprise or disappoint. Berry holds her own as a woman fired from her job in the opening when a job goes wrong. From there she applies as a temp in order to reveal someone in criminal activity. Bruce Willis plays Harrison Hill, ad executive who has much to conceal, and he is smart enough to fire Berry when he figures her out. Giovanni Ribisi as a computer geek has an interesting back story of his own. Nicki Aycox appears briefly to introduce Berry to the whole Hill situation but when she is found murdered, it sets off Berry to investigate. More on Aycox is revealed towards the conclusion that brings into fruition much information. Other roles are more on the standard conventions and nothing more.

She starts an online flirtation and get a job in his office, and since she's so pretty, it's no wonder he's immediately drawn to her. Waiting in the wings is faithful friend Giovanni Ribisi who also has a crush on Halle.If you didn't grow up hearing everyone in your family compare your dad to Bruce Willis, you'll probably really enjoy this romantic thriller. I did, so I try not to watch Bruce Willis in movies where he might have a sex scene, but I did end up finding quite a bit of this movie enjoyable. It's very suspenseful, and Halle looks very pretty. There's a bit of violence, and a fantastic twist, so it's one I'd recommend for a fun girls' night movie or a rental during a rainy day! It might even make a good choice for a steamy date night, if you and your sweetie pie are really close.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Sometimes trailers can be misleading, sadly this is not the case and I was treated (for lack of a better term) to a terribly contrived movie about a investigative journalist (Halle Berry) who starts looking into a mogul (Willis) after her friend dies mysteriously. Awful dialog and sub-par acting (save for Bruce who at least tries somewhat) is coupled with an inane story and ""twists"" that exist for no other logical reason than to merely have twists.

18,gradyharp,Swiss Cheese of a Script and the Audience is One of the Holes,5,23 August 2007,"PERFECT STRANGER is a fast-paced little crime mystery of a film that despite the innumerable sidebars of undeveloped information scattered throughout the script does manage to surprise the audience at the end. The movie seems to be a vehicle for the beautiful Halle Berry to show off her skills and other assets: Bruce Willis is billed as a co-star but his role is minor and unexpectedly underplayed - a nice little tour de force for the king of action flicks.Berry plays a reporter with a man's nom de plume that allows her to uncover secrets of famous people for newsy stories. Once fired from her job for uncovering the deeds of a Senator who is promoted by her newspaper, she teams her good buddy Giovanni Ribisi, a wizard of information about the media and internet spying, and the two go after a wealthy ad executive (Bruce Willis) when the murder of one of Berry's old girlfriends stirs both her wrath and her own secret demons. The chase is on with Berry playing games of deceit backed by the skills of Ribisi. And just when the plot seems to have uncovered the murderer, then another line of story involving Ribisi and Berry explodes the audience's tracking of the crime with a rather good ending.Berry is fine in her role as is Ribisi with his: Willis is not on the screen long enough to form an opinion, a fact that is actually rather a refreshing twist! The camera loves Berry in all her glamour and manages to turn sordid when the plot elements necessitate that. It is a fair evening's diversion and were it not for all the 'dropped ideas' that plead development, it would be a stronger thriller. Grady Harp",Perfect Stranger

With Perfect Stranger I thought I figured everything out from the beginning and I was completely wrong. Didn't see it coming at all, and that what makes a movie like this one better then others in the same genre. I never have been a big fan of Halle Berry, besides her obvious beauty she's not that of a great actress, but in Perfect Stranger she's okay. Not the greatest though, just okay. The storyline is more then okay, full of intrigues and twists until the end. You won't be bored for a second watching this movie. I don't really get why people are watching this kind of movies if they don't like it to begin with. I hate musicals so I just don't watch them, simple as that.

20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Perfect Stranger,5,4 August 2007,"Perfect Stranger is far from perfect, and this is yet another classic example of the marketers taking the source material, and letting their own imagination run wild to get bums on seats. Bruce Willis in a seedy role, and Halle Berry oozing sex appeal with assets spilling out of her dress? That's what the trailers would have led us to believe, that the movie's a classical sexy thriller, but the movie is many miles away, southwards in direction.Halle Berry plays Rowena Price, one of those journalist for gossipy mags, or if you prefer to upmarket her profession, an investigating journalist who digs the lowdown on the bigwigs and unveils the skeletons in their closet. A friend is found murdered, but not before giving her leads that her potential murderer could be Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), New York's top advertising executive, with a penchant for kinky online sex, having spend most of his free time when he's not running the business, in chatrooms, and wining and dining fast ladies for the real thing.So it's up to Rowena to hike her skirt and plunge her neckline to get into Hill's agency to dig for dirt, and naturally to engage in a little naughty online experience with Hill's virtual persona. Add in a jealous assistant in Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi), we get quite a threesome relationship tussle going on, with plenty of sexual innuendos and meanings between lines.But herein lies the problem. In trying to cramp too much into too little time, and having a schizophrenic demeanour in its narrative, Perfect Stranger tries just too damn hard to be too smart with its twists and about turns, and ended up with so many clichés (the horny husband, the rich and beautiful wife, the tech savvy friend, etc) and boring moments, that you can see things coming way before they actually happen. Willis becomes too smug as he sleepwalks through his role, nothing too unfamiliar given previous experience in films like Color of Night (opposite Jane March, who faded into obscurity), and Berry offers nothing more than what we've already *ahem* seen in her earlier works, ever since Swordfish provided that eye-opening experience. Everything in the movie follows a plot which is a tad too convenient, and having had shot 3 different endings for the movie, tells you a lot about how they treated the material. What could have been engaging, or intriguing, turns out to be a yawn.Perfect Stranger suffered from the shall-we-end-here-or-later syndrome, anti-climaxing the plot with a pathetic whimper, and couldn't decide just when to pull the plug, plunging it deeper and deeper into the realm of the ridiculous. Touted as provocative, and highlighted the potential dangers of online chats with identities anonymous and anyone could feign to be somebody else, in actuality Perfect Stranger was very tame and unsexy. What made it worse here is for the distributor to submit an edited version of it in attempts to get more people into the theatres. They really should have left it uncut, and gotten a higher rating.There are other better movies out there worth your time and money, so you can safely give Perfect Stranger the perfect parting gift - the skip.",Perfect Stranger

I mean it's so bad that I just almost hanged myself in my room, it just had the most unoriginal story that I could imagine. Not to mention it was such a waste of good actors. Now I like Halle Barry, and of course, I'm a huge fan of Bruce Willis, so the combo seemed good enough for me and the story seemed sexy and exciting. But it turns out to be an unoriginal dud that does not excite people or keeps them guessing because the story just bangs your head around.Ro is a writer who's ex best friend is murdered, before the murder her best friend tells her about an affair she had with Harrison Hill, a big boss executive at an ad agency and how he wanted to end the affair, but she wanted to continue the relationship or she'd go to his wife. Ro decides to go undercover and discover Hill's dark secrets along with the help of her perverted friend, Miles. Then there are other little stories throughout the film that don't seem that relevant, so I won't bother mentioning.I should have known that when I read the back of the cover's reviews ""Halle Berry is sexy and steams up the screen"", what did that have to do with the movie? It's like that was the only nice thing the critic had to say about Perfect Stranger. I highly recommend that you stay away from this film, I've lost total hope now for Berry, she hasn't made smart choices since Monster's Ball or X-Men. But at least Bruce still has his chance to pull himself back up, just trust me when I say that this is a very bad film.1/10",Perfect Stranger
22,KineticSeoul,Life is already unfair as it is,4,24 October 2009,"This film is a prime example of how to bring down a Oscar winning actress and her reputation. The synopsis of this movie is about a reporter that decides to investigates the murder of her friend's death after her last report she works hard on gets shut down and thinks the link is with a two timing husband who's has a wife that owns a big time wealthy advertising executive thanks to her father. But if the husband is caught cheating, he can kiss the good life goodbye. But all is not what it seems when the twist hits and let me tell you the twist is far from being brilliant. Nothing about this film is remotely creative and they try to sell the movie by making Halle Berry attractive as possible and she is hot. Despite Halle Berry being attractive in this there is no sense of whats going on and that is cause there is nothing to make sense of, even the ending which I am not going to spoil make any sense. The ending is completely irrational since nothing in the course of the film leads to the conclusion, it sort of pops out of nowhere. It almost has nothing to do with the story beforehand, even the clues and evidence has very little to nothing to do with the ending, so it makes you feel cheated, even if the plot is Halle Berry trying to dig in to the cheaters life. It is said to be a psychological thriller, but just about nothing in this film is psychological unless you count the characters that act like idiots and the thriller part of it is very lame. It also jerks the audience around for no reason, where everything comes to a climax there is literally no point in the rest of the plot. It had a mediocre start and a ridiculous finish.4.5/10",Perfect Stranger
23,OllieSuave-007,Typical Crime Drama with poor acting.,4,9 September 2007,"This is a typical drama with a twist at the end. Journalist Rowen Price (Halle Berry) goes undercover to try to expose powerful businessman Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis). In order to enter his world, with the help of friend and colleague Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi), she poses as two individuals: one as a new employee of his and one as an online chat buddy. The concept sounds exciting, but Price posing as the online chat buddy was not emphasized enough. In addition, Price's mission to root out the misconducts of Hill is often interrupted by the subplot of Haley's own personal vendetta in this mission, and his secret love-interest for Price. Many scenes were focused on the Haley and Price subplot, which sways away from the main problem of the movie.Overall, the acting was very cheesy and bland, with dull drama and an unexciting film. Grade D-",Perfect Stranger
24,sddavis63,Dreadfully Dull With Way Too Many Plot Twists,4,31 August 2017,"The cast was promising - the stars of this are Bruce Willis as Harrison and Halle Berry as Ro - and the story seemed mildly interesting. Ro's friend is murdered, and Ro tries to figure out who the killer is, suspecting a guy that her friend was having an anonymous internet romance with. OK. Like I said - it seemed promising. But it turned out to be dreadfully dull for most of its runtime.It starts with an actual interesting story about Ro (an investigative reporter) confronting a US Senator about a sex scandal. But that turns out to have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie. I guess it just establishes that Ro is a hotshot investigative reporter. OK. You could have just told us that. Then her friend gets murdered and she has to figure out who did it. So we spend a huge amount of time watching Ro pretending to be someone else, sending online messages to ""ADEX,"" who she thinks is Harrison. Meanwhile Ro's friend Miles is some sort of tech wizard who spends a lot of his time hacking. Is this serious? Even in 2007 online romances and hacking would have seemed a bit dated. But by 2017? Let's just say that this ten year old movie already seems much older. But I get the sense that the viewer is supposed to be dazzled by this high tech wizardry. The movie meanders and sputters along, with none of it being especially interesting. Then - after 75-80 minutes of boredom, it's as if writer Todd Komarnicki suddenly realized that the script was a dud and filled the last 20- 25 minutes with no fewer than three plot twists. So we go from the killer that the whole movie had suggested, to a new killer, only to find that the old killer was really the killer, only to discover that there was actually a different killer. My mind had gone numb by this point. For the record - plot twist # 1 (which dealt with Miles' relationship with Ro) was the most interesting, and plot twist # 3 (which revealed the real killer) was, I confess, totally unexpected. But, still, you can't save a movie that's been boring for almost an hour and a half with plot twist after plot twist after plot twist. Komarnicki also gives us a lot of unnecessary backstory about Ro's childhood and her abusive father and he throws in the ""f"" word a lot. In my experience overuse of the ""f"" word is a sure sign that a writer knows he's written a dud, and rather than actually fixing the script he throws in the ""f"" word as much as possible, apparently thinking that prolific use of the ""f"" word will make a movie seem hard-hitting and exciting. (Memo to all script writers: IT DOESN'T WORK!!) Not a movie I would recommend at all. (4/10)",Perfect Stranger
25,Buddy-51,"""Imperfect"" would be more like it",4,16 December 2007,"At this point in her career, Halle Berry should probably give some serious consideration to firing her agent. ""Perfect Stranger"" is just the latest in a long line of inferior films in which the actress has appeared since winning the Oscar a few years back for ""Monster's Ball."" Berry plays Rowena Price, an investigative reporter who goes undercover as a temp at an ad agency after a childhood friend of hers turns up dead in the Hudson River. It appears that the friend had just broken up with the married CEO of the company (Bruce Willis) and was on the verge of exposing his wrongdoing to the public.""Perfect Stranger"" is an unimaginative, plodding thriller that believes it can redeem itself in its closing stages with one of those ""surprise"" - but actually utterly implausible - whipsaw endings that have become all the rage these days. It doesn't work - and, in fact, all we feel is resentful, manhandled and cheated because we sense that the filmmakers have not been playing fair with us or abiding by the very same rules of logic that they themselves have laid down for us to follow.Berry may be one of the great beauties of modern cinema, but her acting, in this movie at least, leaves much to be desired. Her shallow reactions and atonal reading of lines suggest that she needs to either hit some serious acting classes again or, at the very least, find roles that will challenge her to go beyond the surface in her performances. Willis is his usual sturdy self, though the screenplay doesn't really give him all that much to do, while Giovanni Ribisi, as Rowena's fellow reporter, gets to perform most of the heavy lifting in the acting department.""Perfect Stranger"" is yet another disposable and instantly forgettable addition to the increasingly unimpressive oeuvre of Miss Halle Berry.",Perfect Stranger
26,gridoon,"Mediocre start and finish, fair middle",4,20 April 2007,"Before seeing ""Perfect Stranger"", I was hoping for another hidden gem like ""Twisted"" (2004), which was also a murder mystery with a female lead and other big names in the cast and also got bad reviews; sadly, this film isn't it.The film starts off poorly - it's a whodunit, but the victim is a character who appears in just one scene before getting bumped off, so we don't have enough time to like or even hate (as it usually happens in, say, the Agatha Christie mysteries) her; so it's harder to find a reason to care who killed her. The film improves somewhat in the middle, with a couple of tense scenes (like the one in the car with Willis suspecting Berry of being a spy, or Berry's entrance into Ribisi's ""secret room""), and a few interesting (if brief) views of the net-chatting world. But then the ending comes, and it's a cheat - the perfect planning required for it is simply too far-fetched (IMDB trivia says they filmed three alternative endings with three alternative killers: the one chosen in the final cut was probably the worst).Halle Berry is GORGEOUS in this movie - I personally think this woman is getting more beautiful every year - but her acting is a bit forced, especially at her ""big"" moments. Bruce Willis has a couple of good scenes, but the rest of the time he pretty much sleepwalks through his role. Another problem is that both their characters are not very interesting, and yet another one is that there is no erotic heat between them, because Bruce is too old for Halle - although their age difference is only 11 years, he would even be more acceptable as her father than as her lover! In a supporting role, Giovani Ribisi is marginally more interesting than the two leads.All in all, this movie is between a 4 and a 5 out of 10, mostly rental material.",Perfect Stranger
27,Robert_duder,Seemingly strong thriller ends up falling flat,6,26 April 2007,"As always I was excited to see another Bruce Willis film because in all fairness he hasn't had the greatest roles as of late. I also admit that I am in the minority of people and do NOT like Halle Berry. I have never seen her anything that is brilliant or captivating and her roles could have been performed by any one but still I anxiously waited to see The Perfect Stranger. The premise is simple enough but the film is chock full of twists and turns that unfortunately don't really keep you riveted as much as they do confused and everything just seems too forced like they purposely threw together certain elements to create suspense when a good writer should get that effect without forcing events. Director James Foley has had a stash of less than stellar and less known films although he had a bit of break through with 1996's teen cult thriller 'Fear' but for the most part I don't think he has the talent or experience to pull off a twisted thriller like this should have been. Same could be said for co-writers Todd Komarnicki, and Jon Bokenkamp, neither of whom have done anything like this to any great degree of success. There just wasn't enough talent of experience on the executive team to make this worthwhile despite the Hollywood elite cast.Halle Berry is tough as nails, Lois Lane like reporter Rowena with a troubled past of sexual abuse and hidden resentment towards men. Berry does an alright job but she came across as far too exotic, sexual and glamorous for this 'girl next door' kind of role. She just wasn't believable. That being said she's not completely wrong for the role and does what's given to her in a decent fashion. Bruce Willis is Harrison Hill, the millionaire ad executive who quickly becomes the suspect in the brutal murder of Rowena's childhood friend. Harrison is a womanizer and a hard guy to work for and has a certain slimy quality about him. Willis is pretty good in this role although it wasn't written quite as flamboyantly slimy as it could have been but then that might have been done on purpose (for the twist at the end.) I happen to think...also probably in a minority...that Willis can be a very versatile and strong actor with terrific screen presence and he proves some of that with this role. He certainly captures your attention on screen and they seem to built the film up before showing up really giving him that leading man quality. Giovanni Ribisi, as he often does, almost steals the show with a small yet effective and well done role as Rowanda's partner and good friend Miles who is secretly infatuated with her. Ribisi's quiet demeanor and effective character acting makes Miles a viable suspect and at the same time you feel a certain amount of sympathy for him. I think out of the three of them (Willis being a very close second) Ribisi had the best performance.Now let's talk twist. A really good twist has to be completely out of the blue, something that makes your mouth drop to the floor is disbelief and sends you back to see the movie again to watch it knowing what you know now and appreciate it on a whole different level. A Perfect Stranger does not give you that kind of twist. It felt more like the writers sat down and said well what would be 'cool', not shocking but what could we do that we think...because we watch CSI and 24...would be 'cool' and they slapped it together. I understand they did several different endings and if that's the cast they picked the wrong one. First of all I had my suspicions half way through the film and I am dumb as a post when it comes to figuring out movies like this and I had it nailed. I 'think' they properly pieced together the film so that the ending made sense and yet I didn't really care. However the addition of the neighbor watching the killer from across the street was a very intriguing part of the ending and added a certain Alfred Hitchcock/Rear Window type moment, implying justice will be served in the end or they will have to kill again. The film is not unredeemable, it has it's moments but it's not the best thriller out there right now, watch it when you have a chance but nothing to rush out to. 6/10",Perfect Stranger
28,MLDinTN,Lackluter thriller with A list stars,6,24 February 2008,"This is a murder mystery; too bad there wasn't enough suspense or chemistry between the lead actors.

It's certainly not a predictable movie, every twist and turn that comes along is unexpected, but they are never pleasing and won't be putting audiences at the edge of their seats. I like Halle Berry and Bruce Willis as actors, but they are both awful in this movie, these roles do not suit them whatsoever, Berry tries to play an undercover journalist with little effect, and Willis's performance as a creepy businessman is wrong and I was genuinely upset watching him portray a character who had some of the worse dialogue I've ever heard. The ending is definitely the weakest moment, it leaves a ton of questions left unanswered, and a ginormous cliffhanger, but thankfully, it's not interesting enough to make you wonder what happened. Poorly written and cringe worthy performances, there is nothing about Perfect Stranger that would make me recommend it to anyone.

30,Dr_Coulardeau,Sad more than thrilling,7,24 April 2010,"It is difficult to speak about this film without spoiling any kind of pleasure because the suspense of this thriller is all contained in the several last minute revelations. Let say that The logic of the story is as simple as simple can be. A child who sees a crime will be traumatized for life and will become either a blackmailer or a criminal, according to the degree of involvement in the initial crime. Then the best cover up for your perversions is to become a journalist that will discover and publicize the little secrets of the powerful. And if the powerful you are targeting have no little secrets, then just build some for them and you may even send them to prison in your place, if you are swift enough. In other words there is only mud and manure in this world and those who carry most of it are those who expose others, and at times without any basis at all, just out of spite and jealousy, or fear and vengeance.

31,filipemanuelneto,It gives too much value to what has no importance at all.,2,30 December 2018,"This movie initially did not seem to me as bad as many say it is. Seriously, it's nice when we see it, but it gets worse when we think about it. The story revolves around a journalist trying to find out the killer of a childhood friend who had told her she was having an affair with a powerful executive at an advertising firm. Of course, the journalist immediately suspects him and decides to infiltrate the company and seduce him to discover the truth.The film has a good initial premise and provides good entertainment and even some pleasant suspense. The problem comes when we think of what we are seeing. Right from the beginning, the journalist tries to expose a politician who, despite being a homosexual, positions himself as an opponent of LGBT rights. At least that's what I understood! I understand that being gay and being publicly homophobic is a contradiction, but it still does not seem to me a reason for a journalistic bore, even when holding public office. The personal life of each one only concerns each one, each one should see the contradictions that may exist and be honest. And as if that were not enough, the journalist then decides to seduce a married man, who she knows to be a womanizer and a contumacious adulterer, to know if he killed her friend. These CEO is portrayed as an adulterer who sexually assaults the female employees... but if sexual harassment is a crime what we see in the film is not: I only saw female employees almost throw themselves into the boss's lap... All this ends up making us forget the homicide, which should be the focus of the film and which loses its importance as the seduction game become more intense. Another thing that does not have any kind of relevance, but the film highlights as far as it can, is the torrid sexual encounters of the main character. Okay, sex sells, but even sex must have a purpose in a movie.Honestly, the problem with this film is the poor script construction, which values the ancillary and forgets the fundamental. Another problem I noticed is the poor build of the characters, who are unable to empathize with the audience, even though I liked the idea that they all had their own ""dark side"", their skeleton in the closet. But this is a consequence of the bad script. Hale Berry tried to show talent and still achieves a satisfactory performance, but did not receive material to shine. Bruce Willis, despite being in a character that allows him to take full advantage of his charm, also did not seem at his best. The two actors built good chemistry, but that's it. Giovanni Ribisi is simply stupid and Nicki Aycox had a character with no credibility whatsoever.The movie entertains, but it is better to see without thinking about it.

Berry and Willis are nice, especially when they play with and against each other, Ribisi is a sophisticated extra, but even they cannot assist in making the movie continuously thrilling. Undertones and nuances change too smoothly - and so does Berry's character.

34,Chris_Docker,"A quiet B-movie, worth watching for those who like to follow murder-mystery plots",5,16 April 2007,"Have you ever met someone who you didn't like at first but, after you made an effort, they kinda got your attention?I had to make the effort with Perfect Stranger. It is not an easy movie to like. Its direction seems pedestrian, the camera-work and editing wanting, and the acting wasted. The characters are not very nice people, but not evil enough to be anti-heroes.But let's work backwards. It has a killer ending. If you worked hard to follow the complex plot, your efforts pay off. That makes you feel good. Like listening to a person you can't get away from who has droned for an hour and a half and then suddenly what they are saying makes a warped kind of sense. The plot might be convoluted, but I have to admire the way it fits the horrible, cynical pieces together. An hour afterwards, it reminds me of old B-movies that you might dig up and pick little gems from their rotting carcass.So what's it about? Well, it could be about anything - no, that's me being too disingenuous. It's a mystery thriller. A whodunnit. It has Halle Berry moving through several personas and Bruce Willis being quite disgusting and yet getting our sympathies. She's an investigative reporter. He's the head of an advertising agency. Then there's some fabulous shots from the newly-completed 7 World Trade Center, the first of the new buildings on the former WTC site. Look out for stunning wraparound views of Lower Manhattan, the Hudson River, and New Jersey.Annoyingly, the film doesn't glamorise its strengths. A key early conversation between Halle Berry (Rowena) and her pal Grace is almost overpowered by the background noise of the subway trains. Almost, but not quite - are you paying attention? The views of New York are more impressive when you think back to them. But at the time we see them, we are trying to figure out what kind of game Harrison Hill is playing. Similarly, an early scene of outrage that could have grandstanded Berry's acting talents is subsumed into a very ordinary establishing shot. But condemn it early on at your peril. Dismiss it and you forego the enjoyment of a well-constructed mystery, even if it doesn't live up to the star ratings its big names might suggest. This film doesn't follow the 'good' rules, you long for something to spice it up. Some flashy camera-work, fancy edits maybe. Or something sexy with Halle Berry's legs? And you don't get much of that. Does the story have you by the balls yet? Probably not. ""Stroke a man's (beep), you get him for one night - stroke his ego and you get him for life."" Grace's comment only hits us after we leave the cinema. It might not be that simple, but Rowena, like any good journalist, only does 'sexy' here for effect.Rowena's pal winds up dead. Very dead. Horribly, bloated, facelessly dead. At this point, I was still thinking how they 'should' have directed the movie to give it more impact. Later on, I appreciate the understated style. It also leaves you free to follow the plot more carefully than if you are having clues and red herrings rammed down your throat.Rowena takes on another identity to get a job at Harrison Hill's agency, as well as some more online personas. The powerful Mr Hill seems to have been in everyone's pants (even though he has a genuinely stunning wife). Yet Willis plays the role with such honesty that we almost don't want him to get caught out. He might be a sleaze but Rowena's co-investigator, Miles, is a sleaze-ball of a different kind. Miles does online jiggery-pokery to find out stuff for Rowena. But he is also a different kind of twisted power-tripper and runs rings around her.Perfect Stranger lulls us into moral condemnation. Its outlook of the world is totally cynical. ""Show me a beautiful woman and I'll show you a man who's tired of (beep)ing her,"" confides a Hill employee to Berry. When you meet the perfect stranger do you assume the best? Or do you assume the worst?""To a certain extent, everybody lives a double life,"" says Academy Award winner Halle Berry. ""We're all complicated beings; we're different people all the time - for example, a woman might act differently at work than she does at home. We all hide something, even from our best friends. This movie highlights that and takes it to the next level, showing what we're capable of when we're forced to come to terms with it.""OK, we know that nothing and no-one is perfect, and we accept that they everyone and everything is 'packaged', right down to the Veronica Secret gift bag that the ad agency is giving away. But ultimately Perfect Stranger is packaged as carelessly as if it were wrapped in second-hand gift wrap. That makes it easy to dismiss. Or loathe. But its self-effacing, redeeming qualities are perhaps sufficient not to ignore. Mystery thriller geeks, get your ticket now, before it is condemned to obscurity.(note - I have censored certain words from the quotes from the film for this site)",Perfect Stranger

Posing as one of his temps and aided by associate Miles Haley they enter into an online game of cat-and-mouse.

Unfortunately, it takes us a little too far down that road. Eventually we end up at the point where the truth is long out of the reach of common sense and logical explanation. If the over acting, and derivative storyline, and a way over-rushed first act (providing no exposition) don't bother you, this will. Well it could've been worse I suppose. I'm not gonna argue that Perfect Stranger is a bad movie. Occasionally it provides the space for some tension to build, and it has some quirky moments as well (which may sound odd for a dark thriller). The movie has its weak areas too of course. None of the cast are given any good direction or original dialogue. director James Foley seems to be mislead into thinking that overacting is the key to being compelling. Halle Berry and Bruce Willis are both unfortunate victims of such clumsy direction. Instead of character, Foley actually seems more interested in making New York look ritzy, which he does well, though it doesn't help the story much.I'm probably being more generous to Perfect Stranger than I should be.

Okay, so now you know it's not Harrison Hill. That is not a big surprise as you watch the movie - you just know it's not him. Then who? Of course we get a huge explanation of just how things went in life for our killer.Now, let's look back and see where the clues were. Funny thing, they aren't anywhere to be found. We had no clue. Of course, the big explanation tells all and still we are not satisfied. I was fuming at the end of this. No wonder Bruce Willis had a smirk on his face as he was bored to death.So what we have here is good acting, good dialogue, good story until the extremely weak ending. I was not amused.

42,chrichtonsworld,no edge on your seat thriller but it is definitely not boring,6,2 July 2007,"After reading several negative comments on this site I was very hesitant to watch this movie! I think Halle Berry is very beautiful and also is able to act quite good! With ""Gothika"" she started the trend to play in bad movies! To be honest I can't blame her! She had the opportunity to be a lead character in some high budget movies. There are not many black actresses around who can say the same! I wouldn't say that ""Perfect Stranger"" is a top notch thriller! But I thought that Halle Berry was more than decent in this one! She did what could be expected of her! She was convincing as the journalist! Of course the twist was a bit much! But that is the point of the twist isn't it? The twist itself was believable (it could have happened)! Although ""Perfect Stranger"" isn't fast paced it never gets boring! There aren't many twists and turns and that may be the reason people are disappointed! But I have to disagree with many reviewers to say that this is a bad movie,because it isn't! It may be quite light but what is wrong with that! At least I enjoyed it much better than say ""Premonition""! Give this movie a chance!",Perfect Stranger

A colleague at Berry's former paper (Giovanni Ribisi) helps her land a job at Willis' company as a temp, where she can better watch Willis. From this point on, it's all downhill. Berry is absolutely unconvincing as a crusading journalist now on a personal mission, and Willis telephones in his performance as a womanizer with a wealthy wife who finances his lifestyle. The surprise ending lacks all logic. You want to see Berry in satisfying action, watch GOTHIKA. a Gothic ghost story set in a lunatic asylum that seems much more ""real"" than this.",Perfect Stranger
44,Sirus_the_Virus,It's not that bad.,6,22 September 2009,"I didn't think that Perfect stranger was that bad. It's not a great film but it's not that bad. I thought that the twist in the end was surprising, but I didn't like it. The twist in the end of the film is definitely surprising, but it is somewhat irritating. You are watching this film, thinking that Bruce Willis is evil, then the film slaps you in the face. I like surprises though. Halle Berry stars as a journalist. When she finds out that her friend is murdered, then she goes undercover. She starts working for Harrison Hill(The very good Bruce Willis), who she thinks killed her friend. Because her friend is the village bicycle. Berry's character and Harrison Hill start to flirt. But she is flirting with danger.I'll admit that this isn't a great film. I do think it is at least worth a rental. Perfect stranger is neither fantastic or disaster. I think it's an okay thriller that has twists that you don't expect. don't believe what you hear. I think that you should at least rent Perfect stranger. You may disagree with me, but I didn't think that it was that bad. Perfect stranger:**1/2 out of ****",Perfect Stranger

It doesn't lack thrills and pshycology, being it a phsycological thriller. Played intensely, with moments of entertainment not delicious but decent though, everything's spoiled by the foolish and outrageous ending - the mystery resolution is too convoluted. It looks like a pre-packedged thriller, ""homogenized"" I'd say, with much part of it taking place in chats. Bruce Willis and Halle Berry have acted much better in past, but are watchable regardless, as well as Giovanni Ribisi; suspense thriller is made bearable but eventually degenerates..",Perfect Stranger
46,rupie,doesn't play fair,3,31 December 2007,"I would second the viewer who commented that the film does not play fair with the viewer, by throwing in at the very end - in an oh-so-cheesy ""so that's how you did it"" sequence - all the explanatory and evidentiary information that had been denied to the viewer in the progress of the film, to wrap things up in a most unconvincing way. To its credit, the film does keep one's interest going throughout its course, but to sucker punch the viewer with such an unfair conclusion is inexcusable. Hitchcock would turn over in his grave. The other sad thing is that Bruce Willis is a finer actor than he seems to give himself credit for (e.g. his work in ""Nobody's Fool""); why does he persist in making dreck like this?",Perfect Stranger

The film is decent for the first half hour but then, thanks to sinfully poorly written scenes, it deteriorates into a banal mish-mosh. The Big Surprise at the end is the clumsiest part, which is a shame because it could have worked - there were enough 'clues' (along with some disturbing dream/flashback sequences) thrown in to warrant this ending but it just falls flat. In all movies, and particularly in this kind of a movie, execution is everything (no pun intended).",Perfect Stranger
48,jdkraus,Thriller delivery: Feeble and Unsatisfying,3,14 April 2007,"Being a natural Bruce Willis fan, and fancying Halle Berry, I decided to see this movie. All I can say is do not expect a psychological thriller like ""Silence of the Lambs"" or even a suspense like ""Premonition"". The film jumped around and drifted from one scene to another with some of the poorest editing I have seen since ""Wicker Park"", containing a lot of ""fade-ins"" and ""fade outs"" and blackening transitioning. Addition to the poor transitions, the camera techniques tried to develop the mystery with a lot of ""Sixth Sense"" similar, odd camera angles which were quite laughable. The whole film was laughable (unintentionally). I was honestly afraid to laugh, fearing other members of the audiences' reactions, but many of them laughed too (I had an excuse to chuckle). The story was not solid, and the script was quite lame, leaving plot holes and an ending so unexpected and so pointless that it made no sense. In other words, the film gave no evidence to lead to the conclusion of the actual killer. The performances were equally bad. Although Bruce Willis still held to his usual, ""tough guy"" charm, he was still limited in the film. Halle Berry was somewhat fit with her role, but not nearly as good as some of her other roles. The only really good actor was Giovanni Ribisi who played Berry's ""nut job"" partner in reporting. He was a bit on the creepy side but he made the film interesting enough for me not to leave the theater.However, the film managed to hold some elements that kept me mildly interested. It is not even worth bothering to see in the theaters. If you want to see it, wait for rental; it is not worth six bucks. Maybe, a dollar at most. Because of Mr. Ribisi's charm, and the unintentional loads of humor, I give it a two out of five.",Perfect Stranger
49,rajdoctor,Perfect Stranger,5,15 April 2007,"Perfect Stranger I had read really bad reviews of the movie on the internet and I was not sure whether I should go to see this movie or not. I had to choose between a 1918 Austrian silent movie and this. I chose this, just because it was a new movie.The story is about a journalist  played by Halle Berry, who does sting operations on rich powerful businessmen. With one mission unsuccessful due to politics and power-play in not covering the sting by the news industry and she quitting her job; she pursues Harrison Hill  played by Bruce Willis  to expose the murder of her friend. She takes the help of her colleague Miles  played by Giovanni Ribisi. I would not disclose the expose and let the last frame suspense let out.The movie is quite engaging throughout, and I found the reviews a bit harsh and lopsided. It is not such a bad movie as made out to be by film critics. The mystery quotient shifts from one character to another, I had guessed one when the murder took place, but due to the course of engrossing events and incidences  I lost that thought; only to re-emerge as the mystery I had guessed in the first place.The ending was a bit lame, and there are lots of loose ends hanging. Halle Berry looks good and tries to act sincerely. At times she has captured some emotions perfectly. Bruce Willis does not have much to do and as usual he mumbles his way through the movie and at times displays his whimsical temper. The surprise pack was Giovanni Ribisi  as the colleague and close friend of Halle Berry  who has a huge crush on her and manipulates Halle's effort to solve the mystery.James Foley  the director, lost the plot in the end, but leaves behind an engrossing story overall.(Stars 5.25 out of 10)",Perfect Stranger
50,museumofdave,"Not A Masterpiece, But An Involving Thriller Which Fooled Me Twice",7,5 March 2013,"I have noticed that a good deal of film criticism seems to have taken place before someone has even seen the film, that a hostile attitude is in place as the film begins, perhaps because of the star, perhaps the money paid, perhaps a reflection of the dismaying trend in politics to not engage, the attitude that the film has got to please in every way in a manner expected or it's bad.I mention this simply because there are a lot of things this suspense thriller is not. But there's much that it is, and it fooled me--and then fooled me again. Are you ever in the mood for a thriller? Just sort of good grade carnival ride that holds together and takes you to a world you never want to inhabit but love to watch for a few hours? This is not a great film by any means, but it is an efficiently made suspense tale that held together for me, anchored by convincing central performances, and without too much gratuitous gore or sophomoric attitude.Berry and Ribisi develop a strange friendship that holds them together in times of stress, and Bruce Willis walks through the film knowing you'll just watch Bruce Willis ambling smoothly through a film--but is he a killer or isn't he?

Thrillers only work when they are hard or even impossible to predict, when they build a decent tension field and when the plot twists they use are more or less plausible. This film fails at all these and therefore fails, and fails very badly.The story itself doesn't start half bad - it is all too plausible in these days of virtual danger turning into real danger. But then the film enters the long and boring stage that builds up towards its climax and that build up is just too long, too slow. Then the climax comes and adds to the insult by being so far fetched that it might just as well be another film added to the original one.

It kept me guessing all the way through the movie as to who was the actual killer. There were a lot of twists and turns that I was not expecting. As thrillers go this was not very predictable. I thought I knew who did it most of the way through the film, but it tricked me well.The acting was really good throughout by everyone. The movie stars Halle Berry, Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi. Halle did an amazing job. Her character was so colourful and strong. She played it very convincing. You can see why she is an Oscar winner. Bruce also did a good job playing the businessman that is being accused. But Giovanni is such a good actor that he seems to be very good in everything that he does.The movie had some good action sequences, but was more about getting you thinking. The only thing I was disappointed with was the ending. Don't get me wrong, I liked it and it was a very interesting twist that I did not see coming at all but it just felt like the twist at the end was added for extra shock.

It was produced by Revolution Studios for Columbia Pictures.A journalist goes undercover to investigate her friend's unresolved murder, for which a wealthy businessman might be responsible. She poses as an employee and engages in a game of cat-and-mouse chase.In my opinion, this is one of Halle Berry's best films - in terms of her performance as an actress and her screen presence, this is one of the most satisfying films she has ever made. It capitalizes on her strengths and she owns the picture, from start to finish with a strong performance and a cool twist overcoming the conventional plot.

Director James Foley thinks he can pull it off with ""Perfect Stranger"" and the result is a straight-to-video howler with A-List actors - Halle Berry (continuing her losing streak), Bruce Willis.Berry, plays Ro (for Rowena), an investigative reporter who calls it quits after her breaking story about a senator's extramarital shenanigans is denied of publication due to the lawmaker's connection with the bosses of the print company she works for.But all is not over yet as far as investigating goes because one night, Grace (Nicki Aycox), a friend from way, back bumps into her and reveals she had slept with ad executive boss Harrison Hill (Willis) after meeting him online and exchanging emails for some time. A few days later, Grace ends up brutally murdered with Hill being the primary suspect so Ro decides to get down to the bottom of things with the help of his computer-whiz friend Miles (Giovanni Ribisi).The screenplay by Todd Komanicki is confusing, trying so hard to throw as much red herrings as it can, hoping that audience would never see the ending, which in the first place is so annoyingly absurd as to be foreseeable. The narrative is more coherent than the earlier ""The Number 23"" but more preposterous. Foley, meanwhile, doesn't generate any sense of suspense in the proceedings and the whole film is deficient of tension and atmosphere that in fact I never realized the film was already in the climax until I checked my watch and found out that the film was good enough for just a few minutes more.Berry, who strode into the annals of moviedom success with her Oscar for ""Monster's Ball"" now seems unable to get her bearings back, churning out disappointing projects one after the other, and this one is no better.

With the help of her computer geek co-worker, Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi), Rowena assumes two identities and works her way into Hill's office as a temp, and in a second identity, as his chat room turn on.The film develops as a mystery thriller, and then becomes a 'who done it,' as we're thrown some red herrings to widen the scope of who might have been the real killer.Others have noted that three different endings were filmed to reveal who killed Grace and how the murder was committed. I think we're going to have to wait for the DVD that contains all three endings to decide which one works best. The one on the Columbia 2007 DVD has an ending that is surprising, but it comes totally out of left field. We are given almost no clues during the movie that set the table for the possibility of this person being the actual murderer. In this sense, the movie doesn't play fair as a mystery.The movie is enjoyable, nonetheless. I was completely unaware of the product placement and Internet naiveté in the film that some other critics focused on. It was just great watching the too beautiful Halle Berry, the stone faced non-actor (in this film, at least) Bruce Willis, and the nutso geek Giovanni Ribisi, who actually had the the second biggest part.Clearly, Halle Berry was the star and almost every scene revolved around her. Way to go girl! She was too beautiful to be an investigative journalist; she would have been more believable as an international model trying to unravel the death of her best friend. If this film is any indication, Bruce Willis, unless he is either being tortured, as in '12 Monkeys' (1995) or is in avenging mode, as in the various John McClain's such as 'Die Hard 3' (1995), or 'Live Free and Die Hard' (2007) doesn't have much going for him as an actor. Here he's mostly a stone face, especially during his trial for murder.And the clichés! The love starved computer geek. And how many times in how many movies (it was even used on 'Desperate Housewives'!) have we seen a character use a secret key to unlock a door to a suspect's room to see a bizarre and perverse collection of pictures and objects?

It's a gathering of many talented Hollywood-onians, so to speak, with Halle Berry and Bruce Willis headlining a great cast that also includes up and comer Giovanni Ribisi. It's directed by one of Hollywood's finest directors, James Foley, and the plot is intriguing and engaging. It's a fine film that is a great addition to the drama/suspense genre.The plot is interesting from the start, with Halle Berry being followed by a mysterious friend. Through an unpredictable series of twists and turns, we eventually find ourselves in the office of the rich and powerful Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis). We also see that the comic relief character (Giovanni Ribisi) is certainly more than that.Now here's the reason Perfect Stranger is getting a bad rap, and I'll be spoiling the ending here so if you haven't seen the film please skip this. If you'll remember the Johnny Depp film ""Secret Window"", the killer was indeed the film's hero, who was the last person we'd expect. The same is true with Perfect Stranger.

I'm not surprised Halle Berry would do a movie like this especially since I could care less about her anyhow,but i'm surprised that Bruce Willis would be in something this bad.It wasn't worth the money I paid to see it but if it was a free screening(I wish it was)then I guess I could say it wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen but it was disappointing.

70,thomvic,Disappointed when it was going quite well.,5,18 December 2010,"After hearing the negative reviews once again for another Halle Berry film after Catwoman, I wondered to myself - surely the critics are just being harsh on her again and are looking too deep into this movie? I thought the premise of this movie sounded quite interesting so I was curious to check it out.And what I will say is that it is entertaining but what the film is telling you throughout it and what it gives you at the end is a bit flat and you didn't see it coming - because the clues didn't make sense.Halle Berry plays Rowena who works in exposing big powerful men dealing in hypocritical or corrupt images of themselves to the public. After her first assignment in exposing a suspected gay senator who is denying gay rights to citizens is jeopardised, she quits her job disgruntled. Her friend Grace, is murdered and the suspect is advertising boss Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis) who is a flirtatious womanizer. Rowena gets the help of her nerdy computer friend Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) to hack into a ton of computer files to help her on her way to justice.There is nothing wrong with this premise. It was quite interesting and I thought Halle Berry gave a decent performance. I thought Bruce Willis however felt a bit flat and didn't have that feeling of intimidation his character is meant to portray.This is one of those films with the big twist at the end. The problem is that the twist is something quite unoriginal, though I didn't see it coming. It would have been a lot more credible if the clues given to us in the film led to this conclusion which it doesn't really go that way. All I will say is that it has to do with who the killer is and you get led on to believe it could be a number of people and then the person who is the culprit is not really given the clues the audience needs to think 'wow I can't believe it!'. You can't believe it because the scenes added at the end that reveal the story weren't anywhere in the movie beforehand! Also, I find it hard to believe that Rowena goes through this chatroom thing at work, and yet Harrison hasn't made a proper check to go through his employee's internet history at work and would have found out that Rowena was chatting to him.I think a lot more thought should have gone into this film as it could have been a really original thriller. Halle Berry is a good actress, but her talents are not used to the potential that it can be unless she gets the right material to work with.",Perfect Stranger

72,lhhung_himself,Really Bad,2,4 July 2007,"Wasn't expecting much from this - it has Bruce Willis and Halle Berry so how bad can it be?Well, really really bad. The plot was just a complete mess, slow, confusing, contradictory, just plain stupid. It's like they shot a beginning, 3 possible endings (none of which relate to the beginning) and then tried to fill in the rest of the dead time. And there's a lot of dead time since there is no action, no sex, not even some cheap laughs to help you make it through awake. Instead, the movie plods along with absolutely no suspense, no reason or rhyme for any of the characters actions with scenes that are completely extraneous and a pretty dumb ending.Complete waste of time.",Perfect Stranger
73,simonparker1990,Has the sexiness of a peanut,2,13 April 2007,"What happened to Halle Berry? A few years back she was the new thing, an actress with an Oscar, done a great supporting role in a Bond movie, had some other pretty credible roles, and starred in the blockbuster X-Men and X-Men 2. And then she went off to star in Catwoman. Why she signed on to star in that loathsome little movie is still beyond me, but she clearly learnt here lesson as she collected her Razzie for the movie in person. But after her little performance in this pathetic little Basic Instinct wannabe I am really not sure whether Halle Berry will ever be able to recover. In all fairness she is the best thing in this movie, she at least does make an effort. But I can't say that for the rest of the movie. I suppose the saddening thing here is that this could have worked, with a better script and with a little effort this movie might be good old dumb fun. Unfortunately instead its a plodding caper without an idea where its going and chucking so many red herrings at us it eventually realises it has none left and leaves us with the only other possible ending.The first thing I suppose I will go on about is the acting. Halle Berry as I said is the best thing in this movie, she does her job efficiently. By no means is she good in the movie, but she comes out of the film with her dignity intact. Its amazing she managed to do this as her character is so badly written, so badly characterised that its a wonder any actress could give the character a sense of humanity. However, her opposite lead, Bruce Willis manages to come out of this mearlly sporting his ridiculous set of hair. Not only is his character poorly written, but Bruce Willis is also badly miscast. The role of Harrison Hill requires someone at least a bit younger, and also with a tiny bit of chemistry with Halle Berry. The scenes where the two try to be sexy to one another comes across as skin crawlingly unbearable. The supporting cast are if truth be told even worse. Halle Berry's friend and ally, Miles, played by Giovanni Ribisi just doesn't work. His character at least becomes a bit interesting in the end, but at first he just seems stupid. Basically everyone else is superfluous.The actual storyline of Perfect Stranger could have worked, I mean its your typical sexy thriller and whodunit. These types of movie should play out pretty well, I mean all you have to do is stick to the set of rules that every other one has laid out and your guaranteed something passable. But what that requires is sex appeal, and unfortunately this movie has all the sex appeal of a peanut. While the thriller side manages to scrap average, the sex side of the movie drags the movies quality down to rock bottom. It tries to be slick, sexy, a bit of a Basic Instinct for a new generation. While Basic Instinct was no classic it still worked on certain levels. All of which Perfect Stranger fails pathetically on. The other major issue with the film has to be the plot twist. Now this might make some people like the movie, it will make others groan and moan about how increasingly stupid the movie gets. For me it seemed, well odd, but I suppose it works. I mean I wouldn't have chosen that ending, but I suppose in the end it was kind of inevitable. Doesn't come close to redeeming the movie though.Perfect Stranger is a desperately dull movie lacking, charm, sexiness and anything remotely like a thrill. Halle Berry manages to save this from complete and utter disaster, but its still a very, very bad movie.",Perfect Stranger
74,TheGOLDENWALRUS,"Just an OK movie with one of those poorly, thought out, crammed in twist",5,3 September 2007,"My dad kept telling me to see this movie and so did most the customers at the video store. It only received 14% on rotten tomatoes so I was skeptical to see it. The movie wasn't that bad.First of all, I disagree with most of you with Halle Berry's acting in this movie. I thought she was pretty solid for the lame script. I loved the part where she told her boss to f*** off. It would be handled very similar if I was in her situation. Bruce Willis was OK. He really didn't have that difficult role to play. Giovanni Ribisi was great. He played a demented character that loved to drink and seemed to be very interested in Halle Berry's character.Now the big problem with the film was the editing and script. A lot of people complain that they were losing interest early in the film and didn't care if there was any payoff or not. I absolutely agree. Comparing the to The Usual Suspects would be like comparing a 3 year old to Babe Ruth. Perfect Stranger was not thought out properly and the twist(s) wasn't satisfying enough. I quickly forgot I even watched the film.All is all, I would check the film out. Those that are easily entertained will most likely really enjoy the film (at least the customers keep raving about it). Those of you that need more then a twist (such as character development), will probably hate this film such as most of the critics. I usually never agree with the critics but they were correct on this one in my eyes.4.5/10 is my verdict",Perfect Stranger
75,the_Poppuns,Noir-ish surprise,8,13 April 2007,"I've read all the negative comments and I'm starting to think someone who hates Halle Berry has created multiple accounts. I hadn't intended on seeing it, I just felt like going to the movies this afternoon. The movie I wanted to see didn't start until later so I said 'what the heck, I'll give it a try'. This movie was a pleasant surprise for me.I called it noir-ish because that's the feeling I got from it. And I have to say that sitting in the theater I thought, 'Gee, it's nice to see a movie with two real live movies stars in it.' You get all kinds of weird combinations these days with stars and starlets and rap artists that it's no wonder that most movies are awful.In this case you have a story about a woman played by Halle Berry who is an investigative reporter for a major newspaper. She has a great story that her paper decides to not use. In anger, she quits, and at the same time a maybe even more important story, involving an advertising giant played by Bruce Willis, falls in her lap. So the movie is about her trying to get to the bottom of this story along with the help of her friend/colleague, played by Giovanni Ribisi. Now I'm purposely not including any spoilers because I personally like to know as little as possible going into a film.I think a good number of people who like movies like The Usual Suspects or Lucky Number Slevin will like something like this. Now where I think we can really tell is if you also saw and didn't hate the Black Dahlia. A lot of people didn't like it. I loved it. But being very specific there were people who didn't like it because they felt the ending was too quick and that there was no way you could have figured it out with the information at hand until the movie explained it for you at the end. I disagree but those people may have a problem with this. Anyone who wants to figure mysteries out before the end and doesn't want to go along for the ride may have the age old complaint of ""how are we supposed to figure it out if they only told you (insert important plot point) at the end?"" I'm not one of those people. I like to go along for the ride. That being said, I do think there is enough info that if you really want to guess at the ending you could do it.The acting was great. I'm not that big on Halle Berry but she did the best job I've seen her do in a while. Bruce is becoming someone I definitely trust with my money. And, imo, it's Giovanni Ribisi who stole the show here. He's getting better all the time.This movie is for adults, not that it's too much for a teenager to handle. I just don't really think it's something your average teen would be interested in. And it's an R for a couple of reasons. So I'm going to recommend it for older mystery and/or noir fans who don't mind not being able to figure out the ending.",Perfect Stranger
76,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Poorly executed and LAME.,3,30 March 2009,"My girlfriend wanted me to watch this movie with her. From the reviews of this movie, I knew before hand what I was about to get myself into, which was wasted time. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by not watching this with her. So I let Perfect Stranger speak for itself.Now let me say that this movie is overall pretty weak in most aspects. The acting is somewhat sub par and didn't make sense in certain sequences. The perverse Giovanni Ribisi was probably the only complex character that had any memorable performance, other than that it was sheer unemotional script. Bruce Willis seemed disinterested in his role and probably known he was bound for better roles than this. As for Halle Berry, this ranks in the bottom with Catwoman as far as performance. Any attempt of suspense was dumbed down by Halle Berry's character trying to seduce the corporate tycoon played by Bruce Willis. Givoanni Ribisi's secret obsession with Halle Berry was just nonsense, and yet another distraction to the story. As for the synopsis of the whole plot, the script and direction made it so obvious that the philandering Bruce Willis wasn't the killer. That fact was slammed into my face repeatedly throughout this waste of time. The disappointing ending is not only awful, it makes the mystery of this movie about who killed Halle Berry's friend absolutely irrelevant. It's not that it destroyed any greatness of this movie anyway, because there wasn't anything in this movie to like. This is without a doubt one of the most poorly executed story lines I have ever seen. Overall, I can't recommend this movie. Watch Usual Suspects instead to know what a good mystery movie is.",Perfect Stranger
77,muons,A pitiful suspense thriller with an incredibly pretentious script,1,23 July 2018,"This is a suspense thriller with the quality of mediocre tv series. Well at least, this was my impression in the first hour or so. Through its normal flow, the movie has already been limping with bad acting, pedestrian directing and haphazard editing of a drab story but the pathetic twist at the end topped it all. Some mystery fans like to guess plot twists from small clues of unfolding events. There's no way one can predict this one which totally turns upside down the whole plot on its head. But make no mistake. This is not a praise for the scriptwriter who apparently got carried away in his attempt to challenge those predictors instead of writing a coherent story. After the final plot which came out of nowhere, nothing you've seen until that time makes sense in this miserable dreck. Avoid it at all cost unless you take pleasure in your intelligence being insulted.",Perfect Stranger

She is this successful reporter who offs this childhood friend who really has no gripe against Berry; but, more against her aging (practically dead) mother who had killed and buried Berry's father in a grave outside her home. Berry was a child at the time! The first 3/4 of the movie draws you in. It is thrilling and you want the pieces of the puzzle filled in.

As a thriller it disappointed me, the story keeps going and going to somewhere that you almost know which one is!, i left the theater totally disappointed with the film. It's like the director prolonged a movie minute by minute only to reach the average 100 minutes and show the long expected end. If you read this, i recommend that go and rent Basic Instinct (the first one of course) that is 1000 times better. The only good thing of the movie was to see in a movie the ""ground zero"", the place where the attack of the world trade center happened. On the trivia they say that for this movie, three different endings were filmed; this was for fun?, or just because they didn't have decided the script?.

82,tsmith417,A confusing premise all the way.,3,2 November 2008,"Enough has been said by other reviewers about the acting, lack of suspense, and lame ending, so I'd like to concentrate on the nonsensical aspects of the story and the characters.Rowena is tortured by nightmares about the sexual abuse she endured from her father, yet she shows no indication of her mental anguish when she's awake, lives a productive and successful life, and apparently does not seek professional help for her problems.I would think that after suffering like that she would be wary, if not completely frightened of men, yet she wears skin-tight, cleavage-revealing clothing to attract men -- any men -- in a sexual way and seems to have suffered no long-lasting damage to her libido.Miles has a job, but apparently doesn't work at it too hard because he's always available to hack into someone else's computer at the ring of a cell phone. He doesn't even have to know what kind of operating system the victim is using because he apparently has this universal software that can be used on any type computer on any type network.He does some of his hacking from his office computer and his boss not only condones it, but praises him for it. You would think the boss would tell him to cut it out, for fear of liability issues, but nooooo.Harrison Hill is a high-profile ad executive who has meetings with clients, attends advertising galas, and has something going with someone every night of the week, yet when he goes on trial for murder he can't come up with an alibi or a single witness to prove he couldn't have done it. You'd think with all his wife's money he could afford a lawyer who could find someone -- anyone -- to testify on his behalf.And I don't know about you, but if I found out that my friend had a secret shrine dedicated to me -- and why must it be secret if it's in his own apartment anyway? -- with pictures taken without my knowledge plastered all over the walls and my head stuck on a naked body as his screensaver, I think I'd be just a little too creeped-out to be friendly with that person for much longer and I certainly wouldn't allow him back into my house.As for the minor characters, minor is not the word to describe them. Rowena's boyfriend has no purpose to the story, Harrison's wife doesn't even get a speaking line and is sort of creepy herself, and there was no reason for Harrison's assistant to be a lesbian, unless the producers thought that just using that word would bring in the young male audience. Anybdy named Esmeralda would call herself by a nickname, and I don't know how many offices you've worked in, but if someone who looked and dressed like Rowena Price ever walked into any place I ever worked, no other female would be her immediate best buddy.The whole movie was stupid, the ending was indeed lame, the characters were unbelievable, and with all the prominent product placements it looked more like an infomercial than a serious drama; I kept waiting for Ron Popeil to show up as a cop or cabdriver.",Perfect Stranger
83,baba44713,"Awful, awful, awful",2,24 December 2007,"What's the point of trying to figure out a whodunit movie if the movie doesn't play fair, not just by withholding crucial information, but by contradicting and faking almost every scene throughout, jerking the audience around just because, well, it can? This movie calls itself a ""psychological thriller"" but the only psychological thing about it is the sheer underestimation of audience's intelligence, and pretty much all the thrills are fake. Take the infamous ""frozen picture"" scene for example: somehow an incriminating picture gets ""frozen"" on Hale Berry's computer screen while ""supposed antagonist no 1"" Bruce Willis approaches her. She tries in vein to turn off the power supply with her foot for about a minute, and I guess we should all be at the edge of our seat, biting nails, pulling hair and whatnot. Now, even if we forget the fact that every monitor usually has a rather convenient on/off button, the scene doesn't even make sense after we learn, well, whatever is the thing we learn afterwards. And you can apply similar logic to almost every scene right until the ending credits.And the ending, oh boy, the ending. I wasn't this disappointed (or insulted) by a movie's resolution since ""The Forgotten"".

The story is pitiful and the direction is sluggish and terrible at best. Bruce Willis brings a nice performance that is wasted in a movie that should have never been made. Halle Berry is one of the weakest actresses to ever hit the screen. This is another example of her lack of acting ability. What she needs to do is find a fantastic director that can work with her limited talent and bring a decent performance out of her. The movies she chooses are some of the worse films to hit the theaters. I would suggest that you avoid this movie at all costs. It is not even worth a rental price.,Perfect Stranger

If not, then move on to something else because this stinker is based on so many improbable coincidences that would never, could ever, have happened that when you see the end you will realize you've been made a chump of the first magnitude. Besides all this, there was no chemistry between any of the actors nor did any of them seem like anything more than actors reading their lines.

87,keiichi73,What's the point of guessing if the movie doesn't play fair?,2,15 April 2007,"After viewing Perfect Stranger, I went on the film's page at the IMDb, and found out that there were three different endings filmed, each one with a different character being guilty. This does not surprise me at all. This is a movie that jerks us around simply for the sole fact that it wants to jerk us around. It doesn't want us to figure it out, and it doesn't play fair. When I realized that there was no point in following the clues and the movie simply plays to the demands of the filmmaker and which ending worked best with test audiences, it made me hate this shallow and silly excuse for a thriller even more.The film centers on an investigative journalist named Rowena (Halle Berry) who specializes in going undercover and exposing corporate and political frauds with the help of her creepy best friend and co-worker Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) who seems to have a certain unhealthy obsession with her that is painfully obvious to the audience, yet Rowena seems blissfully ignorant to. Rowena's having a tough time after she quits her job due to one of her stories falling through and a childhood friend of hers named Grace (Nicki Aycox) turns up dead. The two women just happened to have a chance meeting in a subway shortly before Grace's murder, and she told Rowena about how she had been having an on-line affair with a powerful New York ad executive named Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis). Grace had mentioned that their relationship had recently soured, and that Harrison was no longer talking to her. When evidence pops up that Grace may have been pregnant, Harrison becomes all the more suspicious to Rowena, especially since the man is married and has a long history of past affairs. Deciding to investigate on her own, Rowena turns up at Harrison's corporate office as a Temp and tries to get close to him, with Miles trying to dig up more dirt on the guy. Naturally, things are not what they seem, and the movie has more red herrings than a fresh fish market to keep us guessing in sheer futility.There's nothing exactly wrong with the concept behind Perfect Stranger, and director James Foley certainly gives the movie an attractive look. The problem lies with the screenplay by Todd Komarnicki. He seems to be trying to make an erotic murder thriller along the lines of Basic Instinct, but the movie is not very erotic nor is it very thrilling. The pace is leisurely to the point of being nearly stagnant, and the few sex scenes contained within the film are completely and instantly forgettable. I guess we're supposed to be enthralled by the twisting plot that casts everyone who plays a major role into a shadowy light. The movie stresses time and time again that everyone has dirty secrets, and yes, many secrets are exposed. The problem is almost all of these secrets exist simply to throw us off course. Not one leads to the correct answer. The answer exists simply in whatever of the three endings worked out the best. A thriller like this has to be planned out and lead to one true answer, not whatever answer the filmmakers feel like. Long before we find out that the movie doesn't even want to play fair, Perfect Stranger never truly captures our attention to start with. The characters are murky at best and, as previously mentioned, exist simply to lead us in multiple directions. They are victims of a plot that knows it's clever. They have no personality and no real motivation other than to act as red herrings. A good example is the character of Harrison Hill, who is slimy simply because he is supposed to be slimy for the sake of the story. He cheats on his wife, he threatens his business enemies, and when he finds out that one of his employees has been leaking info to an outside source, he physically abuses him right in front of all the other employees. None of these actions truly matter. They have no motivation and they do not drive his character to any sort of goal. We can't become attached to these people, because they're not even human to start with.Since winning the Oscar for Monster's Ball, Halle Berry seems to be on a strange single-minded quest to kill her career. Chalk up another loss for Berry. She's passable at best, but just about any other actress could have filled her shoes, and she brings nothing to the character. Same goes for Bruce Willis, who has absolutely no charisma, and we cannot understand why he is such a ladies man except for the fact that the movie tells us he is. The only performance that does stand out is Giovanni Ribisi as Miles, and it's for all the wrong reasons. He is immediately suspicious to us, because Ribisi plays up the weirdness of his character almost from the instant he walks onto the screen. This makes the fact that Berry's character does not even seem the least bit unnerved by him make her come across as a total idiot. I will not reveal the ending of Perfect Stranger, but I will say this. When the ending comes, did you personally see anything during the course of the movie that could have led us to the conclusion it wants to lead us to? We don't get the full story beforehand. All the clues, all the evidence, all the paths it had led us down had nothing to do with anything. The movie is a great big exploding cigar that laughs at us when everything blows up in our face. There are no right and wrong answers. Just one very uninteresting movie that doesn't even have the nerve to play fair.",Perfect Stranger

90,eurograd,"loose ties, sloppy editing, good acting",7,30 March 2013,"Perfect Stranger is one of this movies that revisits some often-used (some might say overused) plot involving a high-wheeled corporate person and somebody looking to prove herself and cast away her own demons by engaging in a truth-seeking overture that becomes more than what she had originally signed up for. It is not exactly an innovative opening line, but one that has yielded good movies last 10-12 years.The movie has some serious good acting, especially on he part of Giovanni Ribisi, who proved himself in a role more complex and mature than what he's most known for coming up with on recent years. It also has some subtle but ingenious references to The Devil Wears Prada that are quite easy to notice if you paid attention to the latter. However, the editing has left many loose ties. Some characters have their construction reversed in a manner that appears totally disconnected from the plot. We can try see through the ambiguity of some characters to wonder into their minds, but that doesn't happen at all except for Halle's character (Rowena Price).

91,poyrazbaklan,it is much dumber than it acts like it,3,26 December 2012,"I watched perfect stranger in hopes of a smart thriller, maybe close to(but not like) identity or insomnia. Yet the main premise is so dull and unpromising that not only it bored the stuff out of me, it also made me shout at how dumb the characters were. First of all, Halle Berry's character is supposedly a smart journalist, yet she is definitely computer illiterate. In one scene she had this picture on the screen that her boss isn't supposed to see, and of course he shows up, at the same time the screen somehow freezes. And what does she do instead of turning the screen off? She panics and tries to unplug the cable with her foot. I know scenes like this are supposed to build up tension but come on! In another one she uploads a virus and gets busted by the antivirus software. Instead of shutting the software, she calls giovanni ribisi and this time he(apparently more computer-savvy than her) tells her there is no way past it and they will try later. In any case the movie is so slow paced and so devoid of any actual thrills that you never feel hooked up to it. Even in the end you see what is coming(the other characters somehow fail to do it) and watch the credits dumbfounded and not entertained in any way.",Perfect Stranger
92,sobeit712,"A loosely scripted, uninspired thriller with a twist",2,1 July 2007,"An ambitious and ferocious reporter's life took a strange turn after one of her story got shut down.It has a set up of an intriguing thriller, but turned out to be an 90 minutes long advertisement campaign. There not much a coherent story here. And it requires a great deal of leap of faith and suspense of believe to drag the plot along. Eventually, it ends with a killer twist that makes you go ""what the heck?"" Within these 90 minutes, Halle Berry parades with different sexy outfit, alternating between night gown, tight skirts and cocktail party dresses. There are few scenes the camera literally fixated on her butt for quite a few minutes. Beside that, you got bombarded with blatant product placements.The plot is propelled along basically by the unrealistic hacking capability of Halle Berry's psychotic and geeky coworker played by Giovanni Ribisi. He's the sole excuse of all the impossible tricks the director pulled. It's like ""oh well"", we got a geek here, so we can hack into everything. Therefore, anything is possible. So don't expect anything in this movie to be able to stand test of reason.It's obvious that this is one of those movies that were made for the sole purpose of making a quick buck. For this reason, I rated 1 notch lower than otherwise innocent failed attempt.",Perfect Stranger
93,rcbbo,Take It For What It's Worth,6,12 April 2007,"Is it Friday night? Are you sitting at home with nothing to do? Well, I got something for you to do.Perfect Stranger stars Halle Berry as a journalist named Rowena who goes undercover to bust the man she suspects killed her former friend Grace (Nicki Aycox) After becoming frustrated with her employer, Rowena quits her job at a newspaper and decides to pursue stories on her own without the shackles of censorship.After she discovers that Grace has been murdered, Rowena and her close friend from the paper, Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) decide to go on an investigative mission inside the business run by the man she believes killed her friend, Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis) Over the next 1h49m, we watch as Rowena is hired as a temp at Hill's offices, and as she looks for evidence to prove that Hill killed Grace after she threatened to reveal their affair to his wife. She talks to the office gossip, Gina (Clea Lewis) and chats with Hill over the internet under an alias in order to get to know him better so she can get close and get the info she needs.Rowena gathers the proof along with the friend she so unappreciatively neglects, Miles, as she inches closer to seducing Hill into the trap she's about to spring.Halle Berry is really awful in this movie. Really awful. Willis is OK, but the movie is clearly stolen by two actors. The first is the very surprising Clea Lewis. She is by far the most likable character and she plays it well. The second is the VERY undervalued Giovanni Ribisi who doesn't get the respect he deserves as a very talented actor. I have always loved Ribisi. Ribisi and Lewis have a certain charisma to them that sets their performances so far apart from everyone else's.Is the movie a great movie in the typical sense? No. Not really. Is the ending contrived? Very much so. But the fact is that this movie is not trying to be something it's not. It's not trying to be a great thriller like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs, instead it's simply trying to be a Friday night popcorn flick with a bit of an edge, and in that context, it succeeds to an extent.Overall this movie is decent for what it's trying to be and probably doesn't deserve the horrid reviews it's been getting so far. People need to take it for what it's worth and if you do that, you may find yourself somewhat entertained.6/10",Perfect Stranger
94,alan_v35,Waste of time....,4,13 September 2007,"This mystery/suspense project seems to be mainly concerned with being a jiggle fest for Berry with plenty of slow, panning body shots of her. Now, don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing, but it seems to interrupt the focus off of the story, which flounders in spots and then has an ending that is like throwing a bucket of paint. It gets everything, but nothing is done well.Berry plays Rowena, an investigative journalist who, in a round about way, comes to be investigating her friend's murder. Her only suspect is Harrison Hill, a womanizing advertising mogul, played by Bruce Willis, who seems to have had an Internet romance, turned real with the victim. More evidence is needed (as it always is) so Rowena goes undercover in Hill's company to try to get close to him and his computer. Since online relationships figure somewhat prominently in this movie there are a lot of scenes of the characters typing furiously that kind of reminded me of a cross between Disclosure and You Got Mail. Anyway, Rowena and her friend Miles (who sure seems to have a lot of time on his hands) go after Harrison in all the ways they can think of.Not a bad movie, but it's missing the elements that could have made it a good movie. The acting is average, but the script offered the performers little to work with. It is crammed full of wooden cliché dialog and the characters have little about them to make us care. On top of that the story lacks a sharp focus. Suitable fare for hardcore mystery fans and those who just want to look at Halle Berry for a couple of hours.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com",Perfect Stranger

99,puzgolac,A complete waste of time (and that's an understatement),2,30 September 2007,"I've never commented movies here but I just had to write a word of warning to anyone who's planning on watching this. The movie is slow, boring, without suspense or tension. The story is lame, nothing new nor original, nor even interesting. One is under the impression that they just threw ideas on paper not bothering to shape them into a coherent story (and I use the term ""idea"" in the broadest possible meaning). Hence all the holes and illogic places in the plot. Sorry guys, but a few close-ups of Halle Berry's ass aren't going to make up for the terrible story. The characters are so underdeveloped that they are not even two-dimensional. Acting is just terrible and even though none of the actors did well, Halle Berry must be singled out as absolutely the worst of them. She just can't act. Even when she forces herself to change facial expression nothing really changes in her acting. She might as well be reading the phone book out loud. Scenes which should be dramatic and emotional are just plain ridiculous. Plus, she's too old for the role she was playing here. Curiously enough, she's not the one wearing the most makeup in this movie. Cue Bruce Willis. He is now running neck to neck with Sylwester Stallone in the ""who's wearing the most makeup"" race. Apart from that, he's just being there doing his thing, being exactly the same as in any other movie he's acted in. One wonders why they even bother to change the name his characters, because he portrays them all in the same way.As for the ""twist"" in the end, it would be equally sensible to blame it all on the Monty Python's killer rabbit. No, wait, that would actually make more sense.I was going to give this movie 1 star but I'm giving it 2 so that people wouldn't say that my only goal was to lower the movie's rating.

There is a story here that is interesting to hear and see on the big screen, but without some of the screw ups.

If this remark suggests that being good is irrelevant, inconsequential and immaterial, then why should God have to be good ? and why should you expect him to be so ? and why should you have to try to be like God ? The angry vociferation, ""Money is the root of all evil"", wrongfully dismissed as a misreading, uttered by one badly bitten and badly burnt by money clearly rings more true and is more trenchant and more poignant than the very same yet subtle insinuation contained in the biblical apophthegm. The fact that you would sooner damn love than damn money, clearly tells me what you secretly love and would rather have, and most certainly cannot do without. Is God so inadequate in himself that he now has to need the use of money to save ? Is God greater than money or is money greater than God ?

The portrait of an annoying but also charming detective, David Addison, who takes life on the light side but his love more serious than he would like to show, gained our sympathy. I remember him saying ""this story is as weak as a toilet paper"" in one of the episodes. I really don't know the original script but at least it was translated like that to Turkish. When I saw old David Addison as Harrison Hill in ""Perfect Stranger"", I recalled that line.The movie has got the beauty of Halle Berry and the name of Mr. Willis on board and I assume they thought that would be enough.

You have to bypass your logic in order to watch it without calling some occasions and reactions by the characters rubbish.""Perfect Stranger"" also has a problem with genre... It seems to be a thriller - suspense movie but in times it was shot as if it were a horror movie. Halle Berry is way far from her Oscar winning performance. Bruce Willis who acted in many good movies, but also has a habit of not disappointing his fans even with his average flicks delivers a wooden performance as Mr. Hill.

108,Terminator97C,Perfect Stranger is a perfect mess,2,20 April 2007,"Just when I thought movies could not be anymore bland, Hollywood goes and makes ""Perfect Stranger."" This movie is completely and utterly unoriginal. The film never moves the viewer towards any captivating moments, and frankly you really don't care. ""Perfect Stranger"" is a thriller that follows journalist Rowena (Halle Berry), with the help of her friend Miles (Giovanni Ribisi), as she attempts to solve the murder of her childhood friend. She believes high powered advertisement executive Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis) is the one responsible. Hill is well known as a womanizer, so Rowena, in undercover fashion, begins working at his agency at a temp. Here she can gather evidence against him. However, no one is who they appear to be as the mystery of her friend's murder grows deeper.""Perfect Stranger"" was only filmed for two reasons; showing off Berry's body and for the allegedly overwhelming ending. The events within the film just happen to allow Berry to dress in many different dresses and provocative outfits. How convenient. Even more so, she has to play sexy in order to catch the eye of Hill. I wonder how it feels to be an Academy Award winning actress and to only be picked for a role because of your physical appearance.And this can't miss endingI saw it coming. Honestly, I did. You only have three characters to choose from that could have logically (not that that always matters) committed this murder. Two of them you can rule out fairly early because they are too obvious.Not to give anything away, but this ending does not even make sense. It negates the entire story. So everything that the viewer just watched was a sham; no purpose what so ever. That becomes really frustrating.Films have done this before such as ""The Usual Suspects,"" but most of the time they are done with much more cunning. Even then, the rest of the film still has a purpose.""Perfect Stranger"" heavily relies and dies on this 'shock' ending. The film is also shamefully filled with product placement. Heineken alone must have stiffed the bill for the entire film because ""Perfect Stranger"" is littered with their green bottles. Anytime Rowena comes home she cracks open a nice cold Heineken. Anytime her and Miles begin to do some investigating, Heineken. Neon signs glowing brightly in the back of a bar, you guessed it; Heineken. Any film worth its merit is not going to be stuffed full of such advertisements. I don't mind product placement in small doses or from varying companies but anything of this sole magnitude becomes degrading. Halle Berry, please, you are an Oscar winning actress; stop signing up to do terrible movies. Ever since receiving her Academy Award for best actress in ""Monster's Ball,"" Berry has not taken any roles that would further demonstrate her acting capabilities. It's disappointing to see an actress win that prestigious award and then continue to star in the substandard movies that made her popular. ""Perfect Stranger"" develops into a lifeless, uneventful and entirely preposterous film. Miss it if at all possible; unless you crave Berry.

109,daeris,What was the point of making this movie?,4,10 October 2007,"Is it possible that some people thought ""we basically do not have any interesting story and we do not have any idea about what the story we have is about but we have Halle and Bruce so let's do it""? Apparently it is. Really. Because yes - this movie has no storyline. There is of course some plot but it just does not work. No sense, almost no logical connection between scenes, nothing. And since there was nothing interesting in the story someone thought it could be splendid idea to add some networking/computer/Internet mumbo-jumbo to blur it even more. And it worked perfectly as always when someone from Hollywood tries to input some ""hacking"" into the movie. Inconsequences are countless here, as countless as it is pointless to point them one by one. Together with all that crap we have Bruce, who tries to be charming or brutal randomly and Halle, who is... well, she just is. Can't find better description of her ""acting"" since there is no actual acting there... On the other hand even the best actor need to have some role given to act and it looks like no one actually bothered to give it to those two.

111,Lauren_Simpson,Sexy Berry but Far from Perfect,4,13 April 2007,"Aptly set in the smug, sexed-up world of commercial advertising, ""Perfect Stranger"" is itself an imposter. A pumped-up product of Hollywood's Madison Avenue mentality, the film is awash with product placement, from Reebok to Victoria's Secret, and judging from the number of over-emphasized shots of her bodily assets, Halle Berry's for sale too.Directed by con artiste James Foley, whose last film was 2003's ""Confidence,"" ""Perfect Stranger"" is a film attempting to be a techno-thriller, playing on the way the internet masks identities and can host all kinds of dirty little secrets.Berry is Rowena, a reporter who lusts after news stories that dish the dirt on wealthy, corrupt men. One of these men, high profile ad executive Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), becomes the reporter's prime target after an old friend tracks her down and spins her a tale of web seduction, adultery and rejection.In reality, the ""I-got-dumped-by-a-married-man"" story isn't too juicy for a reporter hoping to nab a Pulitzer, but Rowena takes it. The stakes are raised when the friend ends up dead, provoking an undercover stint at Hill's ad agency, where Rowena hopes to bait the lecherous boss-man albeit with the help of her on-call tech wiz, Miles (Giovanni Ribisi). This is where ""Perfect Stranger"" starts to get silly.We all know that sex sells but, when packaged poorly, it can be a big turn off. Berry is gorgeous and, at times, channels Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct."" Nevertheless, due to flaws in the script and Foley's heavy-handed direction, the film suffers from being over-sexualized, which pushes key scenes into embarrassingly cringe-worthy territory.Worse than that, the third act reveals that ""Perfect Stranger"" is not really about sex or its corrupting power. It's about something entirely different: hidden traumas, self-loathing and lingering guilt. Repeatedly featuring Victoria's Secret throughout the narrative does not count as a clever way to explore themes related to non-disclosure and yet ""Perfect Stranger"" milks the panty peddler for all it's worth.Rowena is a layered character but we don't fully understand her complexities until the end of the film. It's not wrong for a film to lead the audience on; the best thrillers, in fact, capitalize on this technique. They do this, however, by suffusing the first two acts with details that will make audience members think, ""I knew it all along,"" as the final act concludes, even when they didn't.That skill is one that co-writer Jon Bokenkamp seemed to have mastered when he penned ""Taking Lives,"" a film that ""Perfect Stranger"" emulates. Unfortunately he and co-writer Todd Komarnicki failed to reproduce the effect and we're left floundering, with a movie that does nothing but infuriate the viewer and mocks itself further in the last few frames.It'll be hard to sit through most of it, but if you're going to do it, don't miss the last ten minutes. They contain information barely alluded to in the preceding 100 minutes but they are the most important ten minutes in the entire production. Those instructions aside, ""Perfect Stranger"" does not come highly recommended unless, of course, you enjoy watching an Oscar winner add another defeat to her now infamous losing streak.Copyright (c) 2006 by Lauren Simpson",Perfect Stranger
112,mistertcj,Not at all bad.....but Halle Berry disappoints.,6,18 January 2017,"First of all, I would rate this film about 6.5 but it's no way good enough for a 7, so I have rounded down. The movie is quite a riveting 'film noir' with several twist and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat but my main problem with the film is the normally excellent.....the star of the show, Halle Berry. Sure, Giovanni Riblisi can be one of the most classic of over actors but, I don't know what it is about him, but he has this knack of doing it with such style. He does it again here, but it was nothing compared to Halle Berry's performance. To me, she was unusually over the top and very disappointing. And then there's the ever reliable Bruce Willis in, for him, a very different role. But he copes very well as the Mr Sleaze that Halle Berry is trying to bring down for the murder of her friend. Now, I love a film with a major twist at the end and this certainly doesn't disappoint. And the twist certainly hits you suddenly. I hope that I'm not giving away too much here, but when that twist arrived, I wasn't sure whether to be disappointed at the outcome or not. The reason? Because the movie doesn't have any likable characters to properly route for. As I have said, Bruce Willis' character is a sleaze, Giovanni Riblisi's character is creepy, and Halle Berry's 'heroin' is a journalist (need I say more!!!).

113,WolfHai,Too artificial; too much!,4,13 May 2009,"Some movies are disappointing right from the beginning. They start cheap, they continue cheap, you don't want to know more about the story or the characters, and you turn off after 30 minutes.This movie is different. It starts rather good. Halle Berry is beautiful, interesting in her face and as her character. A murder happens, we want to know who it was. We enjoy the classy ambiance of the advertising agency, the restaurants, the fashion. The relationships between the characters makes us curious which directions the relationships will take. Bruce Willis, likable and smart, with the vices of a successful womanizer. I was still into the story after about 1 1/2 hours! But then it happens: Everyone of the important characters starts to reveal more and more tragic entanglements, weird obsessions, strange pasts, and mean streaks, more and weirder (a) than is humanly possible and (b) than fit into a two-hour movie or a viewer's heart. Even worse, these newly revealed secrets do not fit the characters, seem just artificially and arbitrarily added on. The characters begin to lose credibility. At this point, I stopped to identify with and lost interest in them. The story fell apart. The end was neither intellectually nor emotionally satisfying, leaving the viewer with a bad aftertaste.If the makers had not tried to be too clever by putting twist upon twist upon twists into this thriller, but had just let the characters' natural development guide them, it could have been a good movie.",Perfect Stranger

116,wwfxfl2004,Movie was decent with a unpredictable ending,7,10 April 2007,"The movie was alright,I believe they made the most of it with such a sub -par story line. The acting in this picture was great especially for Ribisi performance ,I think the movie would have somewhat fell flat without his humor mix into the suspense thriller.Bruce sure is looking old now ,I think the die hard movie should be a great way to leave on a positive note, unless it falters or course but he could always pull producer/director like Mel Gibson. I really hope they have alternate endings on the DVD when it gets released,oh and having Warrick from CSI was a great move for his rather tiny supporting role. I recommend to check the movie out, it's not like a movie you'd purchase though. more of a one time watch.",Perfect Stranger
117,DSP919,"Computer thriller, what's the big deal?",7,14 April 2007,"I think the relentless attacks on this movie particularly by critics are just totally unfair. Reviews are running about 10-1 against it in some major publications. It is frequently referred to as ""conventional"" or clichéd. In the first place, they criticize it for pandering to public interest because it is partially about computer sex, and also about a congressman who has illicit affairs with boys, and an investigative reporter who tries to find the lowdown on a powerful ad executive who is cheating on his wife. The Congressman/boy scandal actually happened last year in Washington,D.C. In many movies nowadays computers and cell phones play a role (""The Departed"" for example) and at least two recent highly-praised movies (""Me And You and Everyone We Know"" and ""Hard Candy"") are specifically about computer sex. Sex always sells (there are numerous sexual references as well in ""Blades Of Glory"", but this is just Will Ferrell showing his Saturday Night Live! background, it is funny, and to a large extent ""Blades"" rises above this) and to criticize ""Perfect Stranger"" for being sleazy for this reason is hardly fair. Then they criticize the acting performances. I think Halle Berry should be allowed to do her thing. With this movie, she should become an even bigger box office draw. The movie's fast pace really impressed me. It was somewhat like ""The Departed"" in this respect, and ""The Departed"" won an Oscar for editing. You have to stay on your toes to understand what is happening. I thought the detail about Harrison Hill's wife's connection with belladonna was interesting, and it is historically accurate that serial killers have used atropine for years to kill people. I thought Giovanni Ribisi's character as a sleazy computer geek who has his secret lust for Rowena was well-done. There being all types of abnormal psychology, from multiple personality to neurotic, this one seems somewhat middling, perhaps above average, on a scale of 1-10. and the movie has many interesting minor characters, like Rowena's mother, who in the end plays a significant role. I enjoyed the arrest, trial and conviction of Hill--but things are not as they appear to be. Certainly not a movie for rubes or farmers or children, I think this is a sophisticated New York thriller worth the $6 price of admission, though not perfect. I also enjoyed both ""Premonition"" and ""The Reaping"" which movies were likewise trashed by critics for the same reasons.",Perfect Stranger
118,optimusprime12345,this movie was great,8,25 August 2007,The movie started slow but kept us going and from then on it was really good and really suspenseful. Anyway I like too tell you I never would of saw this film if it wasn't for my mother she wrote me a letter saying this film was so wonderful so I saw it and it was more then wonderful.The performances by Halley and Bruce were amazing.I really like too say if you didn't see this then see it.I would like too say it is one of this years best suspense.I would like too say if it were not for my mom I would of never seen it.,Perfect Stranger

120,sakoulas,What ending?,3,20 May 2007,"I saw this flick two days ago and i must say that for a thriller, well, it was not a thriller.... The story lacked character depth - especially Roe - so, not much sympathy for the main character. Acting - leaving Ribisi out - was pretty poor and on occasions the so called 'stars' were at least bored doing their job - acting that is - and the ending was JUST terrible...SPOILER HERE - Anyway, until the last 15 minutes let's say that the movie was going somewhat fine. And then there was the ending 'twist'. WHAT KIND OF IDIOTIC TWIST IS THAT? WHAT KIND OF IDIOTIC ENDING IS THAT? Where was the explanation for Roe's agenda with Grace? Protecting her mother? Please..... Come on people, where is your fantasy? And the idea for implicating an innocent man framing him for murder? One that Roe didn't even know? OK, he was a slime-ball, but murder? She supposedly focused on corrupted ones, not your next door slime-ball but still just the every day businessman. Man, the whole movie went ashtray just from that very very distasteful ending. Well up to the last 15 minutes it deserved a 5.5. But for the ending alone a mere 3. Piece of advice - Go and watch the movie. But when the ending is about to come, run like hell out of the theater and create your own pleasing ending, because the one in the movie will ruin everything for you.",Perfect Stranger
121,voxradu,My Guilty Pleasure Movie,8,17 April 2014,"This movie is in some way one of my guilty pleasures because I always feel good when I'm watching it. The movie brings something new to the thriller genre. It's that feeling you get that makes you want more of it and to be honest I can't understand why the other reviews for this movie are so bad. The plot was great but the twist at the end was a little to much for me too; but not to the point at which I will give the movie a 1/2 out of 10. Leaving all that a side let's talk a little bit about the plot of this movie, no spoilers ahead, so don't worry. Rowena is a girl who works for a local newspaper and she has the job of bringing the secrets of the famous people to light. One day, she is given the task to prove that a very wealthy man (Harrison) is having numerous affairs with different women, one of those being her friend Grace who wants to bring the case of Harrison to light with the help of her friend. Soon, we discover many hidden secrets that lie behind every person that takes part in the story, that being one of the best parts of ""Perfect Stranger"". Go watch this movie in the near future and I can say that you won't be disappointed. You will probably be disappointed by the ending but the rest is pretty much great. 8/10",Perfect Stranger
122,junktodelete-155-36017,Great under-rated movie!,10,4 June 2017,"Boy what a find! Critics only rated the movie 5-6 but what were they thinking? I gave it a 10 just because it's overall average rating was so undeservedly low. I've never done that before but what an injustice to the writers for a 9-ish performance. Halle has never been more beautiful, wow! She also did a 10 performance I thought. The only reason I gave the writers 8-9... is the computer hacking guy's skills were too unrealistic; if he's so good what's he doing working for a newspaper etc? And the online interactions were a little confusing to me but I was able to overlook all of that and enjoyed the movie. I got it cheap as it's so old now and and I don't know anyone who would regret watching it and quite the opposite. It's a minimum of an 8 and should be rated even higher in my opinion. Halles undercover roles to me were very convincing. I could actually see her doing those roles in real life...",Perfect Stranger

124,iztok-gartner-1,A very reliable representative of the genre,7,20 April 2007,"Perfect Stranger is one of those movies of which it is not too wise to talk about too much, because we might reveal very important parts of the story and all its turning points. Many different angles of the plot and convincing twist elements, which there are just about the right amount of to please the audience. Of course, the director's chair was taken by James Foley, the author of two very good movies Glengary Glen Ross and Confidence, by the man who really knows his craft. Halle Berry plays a news reporter Rowena, an ingenious, courageous and sexy enough lady, who starts breathing down Harrison Hill's neck (Bruce Willis), a very wealthy and cunning owner of the advertising agency, whose greatest turn on is internet dating - the thing that got him between the legs of Rowena's childhood friend Grace (Nicki Aycox), who's found dead later on. Intense, sexy, elegant, charming, convincing and well-played thriller, which knows how to pull off it's complex story from start to finish.",Perfect Stranger
125,DJGilby,Excellent Movie,10,16 November 2007,"This movie was outstanding and one of the better movies I have seen in a while. It was a refreshing thriller which kept you guessing until the very end. The acting by everyone in the movie was great. Throughout the entire movie I was trying to figure out if Harrison Hill was the bad guy or if it was Miles or the wife. It was so unexpected that Ro was the killer. The end is what tied the whole movie together and I do not understand why so many people hated this ending. All of the twists kept the movie from never getting boring. I also liked the fact that everyone in the movie had both a kind side and a dark side to their personality. This movie was one of the best this year, so I obviously recommend this movie.",Perfect Stranger
126,Ethabell,Edge of the seat thriller,8,15 April 2007,"First, I loved seeing the brand new 7 World Trade Center close up and WTC developer, Larry Silverstein, in a walk-by in the building's lobby scene; second, the Ansonia, on Broadway on the Upper West Side, third, Sapa... New York, New York. As a recent relo to Los Angeles, I miss that city.The story kept the theater audience enrapt and there were applause at the end. Bad reviews? I should have known Halle, Bruce and Giovanni would never be part of a loser film. It was good, maybe a bit far fetched but there is a crazy world out there that gets crazier every day... so may be not so far-fetched... Spider Man? Now, that's far-fetched!",Perfect Stranger
127,nonefornow,Just another twist movie with an uncreative storyline,2,11 April 2007,"I watched Perfect Stranger at a preview at my local theater this past weekend, and next to the scantily clad Halle Berry, there was no reason to go watch this movie. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with movies with twists, but as long as they're done with thought, taste, and creativity. The problem in this movie is writers have all the freedom in the world to guide a viewer's mind and place where the twists lie. It is too easy for writers to trick the audience, and to some audience members, the simple trick in itself is good enough to make the movie ""great."" Well, this doesn't cut it for me. I want a movie that connects, makes me think, has me connect with a character, or even teaches me something. Perfect Stranger lacked meaning, taste, and creativity and is just another one of those ""movies with a twist."" FYI: The movie was a long advertisement with way too much product placement. Even if the movie does bomb, the movie industry would have made up for the loss with the amount of advertising they put in the movie.",Perfect Stranger

(Heck, even if you go to the theater every week I wouldn't bother with it.) The acting is mostly poor, especially Halle Berry, but that's not the real problem with this movie. The plot is uninteresting to begin with, and then the surprise twist makes so little sense that you walk out of the theater shaking your head.Even more distasteful is the copious and shameless product placement. Having real products in a movie isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when it's done like this, it just wants to make you puke.Honestly, I wouldn't even waste a rental on this thing, unless you really need to see a few shots of Halle Berry's semi-naked body. But you can see far more in other movies.",Perfect Stranger
130,MartaRusek,Miss it if you can,1,13 April 2007,"When the lovely Halle Berry and Giovanni Ribisi came to introduce 'Perfect Stranger' at an exclusive screening in Philadelphia, PA a few weeks ago, they pleaded, ""Don't give away the ending, or you'll ruin the surprise for everyone else."" The ending, and all that comes before it, is mindless, dismissible crap. It attempts to be like 'The Sixth Sense,' where all that we thought is turned on its head, but it fell flat. The ending and its connection to the rest of the film took too long to explain. A great ending requires no explanation: we get it as soon as it happens, and it stays with us.The only other thing I'll say about this waste of time and money is that people were laughing during this movie, and it wasn't a comedy in the slightest (at least not intentionally).Mayor John Street, the next time you pass a law that names a calendar day after a movie, see the movie first to make sure it's not an embarrassment.",Perfect Stranger
131,darbea,No wonder I haven't heard of it,3,30 September 2007,"I gave it 3 stars only because of the 3 actors in it: Willis, Berry, and Ribisi, all actors of better quality than this poor film opportunes them. The script, editing, directing, and so forth were plodding at best; They must have left the good stuff on the cutting room floor.There was no sense of mystery or thrill, just an overwhelming desire to end watching this movie. The ending, though unexpected, was hardly surprising. Seen it too many times before. Here's the spoiler, so if you don't want to know the end, stop reading:Frankly, I thought the wife was doing it, until I saw Ribisi's shrine. Then, of course, I thought he done it. Although I did have my doubts, he always gets stuck with the creepo roles, I thought he would get a reprieve here.Then the 'TWIST' at the end, used too many times, we find that HAlle did it, because she was abused by her father or stepfather (or whatever he was, I'm sure they said it in the movie, but I didn't care), when she was a little girl.My question is why did these actors sign on to this movie? I heard Bruce Willis say that he signed on for the chance to work and flirt with Halle; I guess I'd do it too. Who wouldn't want a chance to really flirt with with her? But then again, how come she can't stay married in real life? Does she just make bad choices in men, or is she somebody totally different in real life? But what does that matter with this movie, anyway?Her movie choices have been beneath her talent lately, or else there aren't many choices coming her way, I don't know. As far as her nude scene in that John Travolta movie a few years ago, although it was just amazing (from a guy's point of view), it took the mystery out. Some of the sexiest women in movies never showed it all (darn-it); I guess that was part of their mystique. It just wasn't the right vehicle for her to do it in. Not that I'm complaining... but I digress. As for Ribisi, I wish he would try other characters... I'm sure he has the talent... He wasn't a creep in ""Private Ryan"", I would hate to see him typecast.Anyway, a bad movie, wasting good talent.",Perfect Stranger
132,davidtussey,Just never clicks...,2,1 September 2007,"I've often heard of movies where ""there's just no chemistry between the stars"". Now I've seen one. This movie, although loaded with stars and grand shots of New York, is just flat, flat, flat. It never builds suspense or any level of tension. And the whole basic premise of online sexual conversations is so 90's. As the head of a hot ad agency in New York City, Bruce has more supermodels hanging off him than you can imagine. Why would I believe that he needs to go online to find women? Just not credible. Bruce Willis basically smirks throughout the whole movie. That's his role. Halle Berry looks fabulous, but there's not a single clue as to her role in the ending. The whole movie just doesn't work. In the end -- I just didn't care about any of the characters or the outcome. Disappointing.",Perfect Stranger
133,rzk357,In the same spirit of this movie,2,4 September 2007,"let me just say this: It sucks. Boring, boring, boring. Seemed like a four hour movie. This film is about nothing. Don't waste your time. I have to wonder why Hollywood churned this one out. Unrealistic people, and no, was supposed to be realistic, not stupid. Almost had a storyline at times, making one hope that the sleep section was over, but then it drifts back into nothingness. What the movie lacked in story, it tried to make up for in foul language that didn't advance the plot. All movie audiences are accustomed to the four letter words. This movie thought it was the first to use them. At odd times. At odd places. For odd reasons. All of the above is really too bad, for it certainly had capable people in it, but they were in bad need of a script to match their talents.",Perfect Stranger
134,storer90,Has Potential,5,1 April 2008,"Perfect Stranger was in the $10 DVD bin at Target so I picked it up without having any prior expectations of it.It could have been good; it really could have been a brilliant film. However, there are too many undeveloped sub-plots and concepts that were never pursued because of the fact that there were three endings. Had they picked their ending and placed the pieces strategically throughout the film to support that one ending, it would have been awesome.I can say that I didn't guess the ending; I doubt many people would because it comes completely out of nowhere. The relationship with Grace is not well developed, the childhood abuse sub-plot is only dumped in at the end with little precursors, and the fact that Rowena continues to talk and meet with Miles after what she discovers in his apartment is, literally, unbelievable.The cinematography is good, and it is a very visually pleasing movie. The acting is okay, no real standouts except for Ribisi, who played the freak very well. The real problem is with the screenplay and writing. So 5 out of 10 for potential. A remake could be a serious improvement.",Perfect Stranger

So when childhood friend Grace Clayton, who was having an affair with married advertising executive Harrison (Bruce Willis), turns up murdered, Rowena is determined to find the truth. Thanks to her associate, tech-savvy Miles (Giovanni Ribisi), Rowena gains access to Grace's e-mail and learns that Grace was threatening to go to Hill's wife. Armed with that knowledge, Rowena goes undercover and becomes the perfect stranger  first as a temp, Katherine, in Hill's advertising agency, and then as Rocketgirl aka Veronica, another one of his online paramours. She watches the unsuspecting Hill from all sides, taking note of his wife doing the same. This is a man with an appetite for power, a weakness for women, and a wife on alert. But in exposing Hill's secrets Ro unwittingly discovers a connection between Grace and two significant people in her life; her boyfriend, Cameron (Gary Dourdan) and her best friend, Miles, leaving her feeling confused, betrayed, and with no one to trust on this journey. The closer Ro gets to the truth, the more we begin to ask: What was this secret Grace had? And why would someone kill to protect it?

What I mean is: Halle Berry a temporary office helper at lower position at worlds biggest agency blabla, well she is a small new office chick BUT she is able to afford an apartment at the Insomnia building on central park west! And even when her boss comes to pick her up to work he didn't ask: Do we pay too way much to brand new office assistants if they make a living on the upper west side?? A mulitmilliondollar neighborhood- Since Willis owned an apartment with Demi Moore just a few blocks away in the nineties he should know, at least :o) Anyways, H2A is located in a HIGH-END agency building with picture ID-card access and Berry is able to enter on a fake Id. With a fake lousy CV, who cares- Nevermind, even if some the people keep theirs keys right on top or underneath their doorsteps, in a wicked place like NYC- Those little goofs make the whole picture a little bit questionable to me but its been still worth seeing it- I'd bet they'll offer different endings on the DVD which is not out here in Germany since the movie is just out now.",Perfect Stranger

It's not a good movie, it's quite sloppy, mediocre and the twist feels like it was pulled out of the writers' asses... but it is entertaining. The acting is not the best and i blame the script, there's just something that feels unnatural about the way these people speak, the characters talk too much and say nothing at all.It had potential, when the second act picked up it started being more exciting and the revelation of Hill's dirty deeds and Miles' hidden truth brought the suspense to a new level but then they had to bring up an ending. The movie never alluded to that conclusion save for the scene where Rowena is nervous after Grace's death in the police station, and the vague flashbacks of her life with her mom and stepfather that were overshadowed by the present events.

It's more of a b-movie, to watch on some rainy Sunday when you're done washing the dishes and cleaned your house. The main informations are going way too fast, and you lose track, and just start to wonder how the director would end the picture. The movie could have been shorter, because we feel that it streches a bit too long and we just wonder WHEN OH WHEN are they going to turn on the lights in the cinema.

When Halle's character first reports for her undercover role in Harrison's offices, a character at a counter in the lobby turns toward the camera and walks to the right side of the frame. It's Lucky Larry Silverstein, the man who purchased the lease on the World Trade Center in July 2001, invested a few million bucks of his own in the purchase, slapped an insurance policy on the property to protect against terrorism, and cleaned up to the tune of $4.5 Billion (and got his down payment back) when the events of 9/11 unfolded.

Booooring!Halle Berry did definitely not the best of what she could, and Bruce just becomes older.. Their couple looks weird, but still worth seeing it!

Well i watched it because nothing else was playing,and and it was nothing that i thought it would be,it was so much worst.First of all,i love Hallie berry,so this is not easy for me to write, i think she is an amazing person and gorgeous,but berry your amazing looks just could not save this movie from it ugly acting.I thought her acting was terrible,she was even better in the Flintstones.The movie started off boring until close to the end. I thought thrillers were suppose to capture the audience attention from start to finish.The writers i think tried too hard to display catchy intense lines that did nothing but send me to boredom land. The actor who plays Hollie's best friend was also trying way too hard in his acting to come off creepy and lunatic,so you definitely knew he wasn't the killer. Also Bruce Willis character i figured could not be the killer for the main reason that he was being focused on,i have watched may thrillers and suspense movies to know that the person who is mostly portrayed as the killer is never the killer,esp in the first 10mins of the movie.Way too drawn out and i feel the director tried too hard to capture the intensity and the suspense that a good thriller must have. Overall i was not a fan of this movie,the only positive thing i must say was the twist however, it needed better writing,screen-shots,and BETTER Directing. Maybe if the movie contained those elements it would have been a major hit with Hallie berry fans and Bruce Willis.Watch this movie for the sole purpose of seeing how lame the plot is and how better it could have been with better elements like acting and a writing.",Perfect Stranger

148,edwinpblue,could have had a better ending,4,12 September 2007,"I was disappointed with the ending of this film. I love movies that have a twist or two at the end but this was ridiculous. Had I been directing, I would have had Miles confront Rowena in a similar fashion but with one major twist. I would have kept his murder as part of the seen but then I would have had Rowena somehow notice the ""wire"" the Miles was wearing. Perhaps I would have had the police storm in when Miles is killed; imagine her surprise when they come storming in to the kitchen. Having another ""rear window"" type voyeur was a little too much though. A better ending would have been that slime ball Harrison passing Rowena as he is being released from prison and show is riding in on the bus. Overall I give it four stars.",Perfect Stranger
149,jodatoufin-863-92036,Not that bad,4,6 January 2015,"This movie was made with three different endings one for each of the three main characters. It is full of Red Herrings, making you believe one ending when it is really another. The movie is actually rather humbling, you believe that you have figured it out 20 minutes into the beginning when you really haven't. I and was surprised by the ending feel rather dumb being so.That being said, the movie isn't great. It is in an area that makes you creeped out but not creeped out enough to be entertained. It is unnecessarily vulgar at times. It also seems that they dragged it out in an ill-fated attempt to make it more successful.I do want to give this film so credit where it is due. Director James Foley and lead actress Halle Berry have a pretty good performances considering the weak script. This movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of Halle Berry and/or suspense dramas.",Perfect Stranger
150,urbannme-1,Not fair,4,20 April 2007,"There is no point of finding who the killer is. There is no clues either. It's not *SCREAM* here. I knew from the first 13 minutes of the movie that my best bet would be on the character you guess is the only one that couldn't kill a non-moving-near-death-fly. And since that the trailer says: ""You cannot guess how it'll end"". It's even easier to guess !!And you won your bet right? I did too!The last 10 minutes is a rush of what motivated the killer to accomplish his art. So as I said, there's no point of collecting proofs since you all get them on a silver plate. To make long story short, you can skip the first hour and half snoozing in the theater as I should have done and then walk up to your car with a depressing face, it will have the same effect.And Oh! the whole thing around Victoria SECRET...

If it had been a book.... I would have tossed it after the first 3 or 4 chapters. In that it is a movie @ 2/3 of the way through it I started to do sits up while at the same time hoping it would end. Somewhat surprising is that Willis would sign on to this..although no actor can know how the finished product will turn out. There were at times (in my imind) that it seemed as the lines were ad=-libed...eg; when Willis' characther flubs the speech at the Vict. Secrets party. Many instances like that where it seemed like the director said...""oh just keep rolling..no big deal..no one will notice..."" Many better movies to invest 2 hours of your life with. Even of you are a Willis fan (as I am) ...tread carefully. See Wallstreet instead for corp. greed and suspense.",Perfect Stranger

As I sat watching this movie in a invite only screener, I noticed in the first ten minutes that Halle Berry cannot act. Her acting was mediocre, but the actor Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi saved this movie. Halle Berry is a beautiful face, but that is all she offered here.This movie had some nice twists coupled with a nice elements likened to the game Clue. I say that because you constantly go through the assumptions of who did it, and how it was performed. I am glad I got to see it for free. It is worth taking a date to, but definitely will not win any awards.

153,CDoswell,I don't know why the movie was even released.,3,23 April 2007,"The only reason i can see for this movie to be released is because celebrities are in it. But, Halle Berry over-acts a choppy and shallowly developed character. I spent the whole movie waiting for the plot to really get going, but instead what i got was a whole bunch of disconnected plot points and irrelevant characters. It is supposed to be suspenseful, but mostly i just wanted it to be over. When the end came, yes, it was a surprise, but by that time I did not care about the story at all. And it was only ""surprising"" because the whole story is random events all loosely, very loosely connected to the end. It was almost...amateur. The story does not give enough background on most characters to evoke sympathy, emotion, or interest...ESPECIALLY Willis' character. It's a movie that is good in theory, but wasn't focused enough to be held in the same esteem as other psychological thrillers. The most developed and well acted character is really Ribisi's. His performance is noteworthy and enough to warrant the 3 out of 10.",Perfect Stranger

Unfortunately the plot was ridiculous and very confusing which spoiled it a lot.Bruce Willis was great though as the charismatic head of a New York advertising agency.I didn't expect him to be good because i saw him as an action hero, a la John McLain from Die Hard, into physical action with blood everywhere. I didn't expect him playing a boring business man to be interesting.However the character he developed was believable as the successful, charismatic and aggressive head of the agency. He played the successful 50-something executive with a passion for beautiful younger women very well and the character was exciting.There were also several scenes near the end of the movie, when he discovered that he had been betrayed, which were genuinely scary and the audience was left on the edge of their seats waiting for him to violently explode.7/10 for the movie and 10/10 for Bruce Willis.",Perfect Stranger

Edward Norton's 2002 film ""25th Hour"" actually shows the site being cleaned up prominently for a good span, and some commentary about it.Berry doesn't feel right for most this flick.

Sadly I will not purchase this movie.I also believe if the movie was a tad bit longer and slowed down in parts,it would help.What I should have done is sat back and counted the bad word that was repeated over and over again.I am no writer,but my nieces and nephews could have written one word a hundred times over without thinking about it too.",Perfect Stranger

Halle's performance showed how dynamic and reminds you what a great actress she is. Bruce another great performance along with Giovanni the plot and synopsis could have been more detailed and the writers could have made the murder scene a lot more vivid in how the person gets murdered for example: a visual reenactment or something along those lines. For a two hour long movie they could have been more descriptive that would be the only downfall. other then that the movies was watchable. the way the plot twists is exceptional which is what kept awake through the whole thing. although i feel little regret in not going to see ""Distrubia"", the movie was good.",Perfect Stranger

Although it holds mild interest in the initial stages, it quickly morphs into a manipulative, formalistic, contrived mess that does nothing to restore my faith in Hollywood. I am always amazed that credible actors like Willis and Berry agree to appear in this kind of stuff. Perhaps they either did not read the script or the almighty dollar caused them to shelve their artistic sense and act in a movie that is destined for the DVD ""Bargain Bin"" at Walmart faster than you can say ""stinker"".

I feel I'm not alone in my disgust as the fellow movie-goer sitting next me was out cold snoring 20 minutes into the film. As painful as it was from scene to scene, the movie just seemed to get worse and worse, quickly spiraling out of control.

Acting on Halle Berry's and Bruce Willis' part wasn't too bad, although I've seen them both do better. Overall, I would recommend it to see once, but that's really all you need.

Bruce will too knew how to play his role, ad same thing as Giovanni Ribisi he was perfect too .

It was very hard for me to believe that Bruce Wills was the killer. He is a great actor just like Halle Berry. Just for the previous that I saw i knew it was going to be good.

Also this has got to be a low point in Bruce Willis's career, thank god he has Die Hard 4.0 to fall back on.Halle is starting to build up a list of pathetic thrillers, Gothika and now this rubbish, don't give up your modeling career just yet........Trust me on this one, only watch if you have nothing to do other than rent the backpage titles of your local video store....3 out of 10",Perfect Stranger

But although I don't think it has to be clear to the audience who was the murder, there was some clues. We knew there was something strange going on in Ro's past. Something that had to mean something. And as we saw in the end. It did. So I don't agree with the first comment about the movie. I definitely don't understand people's criticism.

Unfortunately, it turned out to be an average film yet still entertaining for a night out. What it lacks is pace and style. It could have been such a stylish film taking place in NYC, in the advertising industry with Halle Berry. It turned out to be poorly put together. I will surely remember the film director so I can avoid his next films.The seldom cat walk scenes from Halle Berry and the predictable thriller twist at the end are worth the wait but do not save the film.

169,TheOnlineMagic,"""Perfect Stranger"" Perfect Gem",8,24 August 2007,"This is an eloquent movie. Everyone has secrets and most all of us keep them at bay, those demons in our lives about a decision or decisions we've made, in the past, that could make us be viewed by others as being a ""Bad"" person. We would be judged and for most of us we try and avoid this type of situation. Although, most of us have not committed murder, this is an excellent portrayal of a person who has and tries to survive to keep this type of secret in the past, least deal with it on a daily basis. Halle Berry envelopes her character beautifully. Putting on many faces in this movie and looking in the mirror asking herself who she really is and what she has become, Halle has got it down to the ""T."" She lives vicariously through the different roles she performs in this movie, not knowing her true self. The tension she's created for this role is wonderful. Having Bruce Willis in a role other than the ""Good Guy"" couldn't have been a better choice. It places suspicion on his character so naturally and he projects that very well. Being a psycho-drama/thriller film enthusiast I was completely surprised at the end of the movie. The last 5 minutes were well worth waiting for. It took me by complete surprise. This is a movie that requires you to think a little, listen a little and watch a lot. The clues are there for you. I must have been wrapped up in the journey as a whole so I didn't figure out the ending ahead of its time. The direction is quite marvelous. James Foley, the Director, captured pretty much all the emotions, angles and story lines possible for this story to work on the main screen. He makes you ask yourself, ""What could happen next?"" The photography and lighting is very good at representing the movies mode. Each scene is splashed with subliminal opposites from set, color and textures: hot and cold, smooth and rough, dark and light, monochrome and color. I went into watching this movie blindly. I didn't see any trailers, read any articles nor talked to anyone about the movie, so I wasn't influenced by any outside sources. I recommend this movie as a great view away from all the action packed, standard plots, sex filled and BIG budgeted movies. It truly is a gem to watch. Who but yourself could be the ""Perfect Stranger"".",Perfect Stranger
170,rookiemonkeys,Did Not Translate to the Big Screen,3,18 September 2007,"This was a film I and my wife had been eagerly awaiting for years. We both grew up in the Midwest, settling in with our respective families on Friday nights to see what new, zany adventure was in store for the lovable roommates Larry Appleton and Balki Bartokomous (and sometimes on again, off again girlfriends Jennifer and Mary Anne). It seemed the creatively brilliant writers were to always come up with a new naive miscommunication for our immigrant friend Balki or a get rich quick scheme for Larry. In either case, calamity was sure to ensue and a great deal of laughter along with.NOT (I repeat NOT) the case for the recent effort to make this a feature length film. While I applaud the idea, everything after that falls severely short of expectation. At first impression, I was OK with Bruce Willis's more intense approach to the character of Larry, but as the film dragged on, I failed to see parallel with the original work done by Mark Linn-Baker. And come on, Bruce, would it really deal a blow to your artistic integrity to throw a colorful cardigan on once in a while for those us that came looking for the 1980's nostalgia? But if Bruce Willis's work demanded a C+, Halle Berry's portrayal of Balki Bartokomous was a solid D. Again, I realize its 2007 and the movie goer wants more sex appeal, so I accept using a femme fatale for one of the roommates, but it didn't seem Ms. Berry did her research AT ALL. Her comedic value was zero and shame on the speech coaches for her atrocious Myposian accent. I have no doubt that Bronson Pinchot was not available for consultation on the set.My assessment is that Willis and Berry may have success on the big screen yet, but any true Perfect Strangers fan should save their $10 and wait patiently for the next time our friends in Hollywood give it a go.",Perfect Stranger

Contrary to most of the negative posts (of which we have read only a very few!) this is a great who-done-it. We read comments about not being able to figure it out and that it isn't fair. Well tell that to Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock! If you look back to many of the things shown in the movie it will all be supported by the end--what more could you ask? We enjoyed the performances of everyone in the movie and have liked them all in the movies we have seen. We watch to be entertained and if a movie will make us guess and guess and, in the end, give us a Wow, then we are very pleased.Back to the comment that too many 'could have done it'-think about Murder on the Orient Express and each person, once examined, was thought to be the guilty party. This is not a new angle but a tried and true one.We also prefer to watch a movie before reading about it as we have found that only in a few cases are the comments or critics in agreement with us.

172,Mark8911-1,Somewhat implausible Hollywood politics,4,30 March 2008,"I like movies with a little political angle. This one starts out in typical Hollywood fashion: Halle Berry, the beautiful, heroic investigative reporter exposing a hypocritical gay Republican Senator who's foursquare for family values except when he's frolicking in the hot tub with his comely male intern. So far so good, until the beautiful reporter's story is spiked by her corrupt bosses because, get this, the powerful Republican Senator paid them off. Just to put human faces on this, it's like Larry Craig paying off Pinch Sulzberger not to run a story that would ruin his political career. Then, if you can choke that one down, Halle Berry speculates that the editors spiked it because they endorsed the Senator's campaign.So a story implicating a conservative Senator in a gay sex scandal can't find a willing New York newspaper publisher to print it because they're all out endorsing family-values candidates. The mind reels.Halle Berry lays on the self-righteous indignation a little thick, and is rather implausibly unconcerned about losing her job. Giovanni Ribisi is weirdly likable and Bruce Willis does his usual note-perfect Bruce Willis impression. A heavy-hearted thumbs down.",Perfect Stranger

It's so true to life, that the people you meet in life and think you know, you really don't! I took away from this film that the premise is that everyone has secrets, secrets that if you knew, you probably would not be associating with those people, or maybe you would, and the lengths people will go to, to keep secrets and keep people from finding out about their indiscretions and not so perfect past.

The characters are credible, the give aways are there to be seen for those who want...just consider the way Berry changes her reactions to other people as she moves from one scene/relationship to another.

177,red_talon_ragabash,Ugh,1,20 October 2007,"I don't normally comment on this. I drift though IMDb at best. But this I couldn't ignore.The film is poor, it seems to get by poorly on the names of the stars. I watched it purely for Giovanni Ribisi, and even then came out disappointed.The film's core idea isn't bad. I'll give it that. Where it flounders is in it's conception of that, and in it's use of the Internet.While I can't believe the people who created this film have never used the internet in their life, the film suggests it. The writers seem to have little to no idea about how the internet, or people who use the internet work. To quote a conversation I had with my girlfriend:""He's evil! He's using the internet to have anonymous cybersex"" ""...and?"" ""He's pretending to be someone else!"" ""...Because we've never done that before?""While Ribisi doesn't turn out to be The big-bad, he's written as one of them, purely because he does things on the internet that everyone has done at one point or another (I challenge anyone who disagrees to prove that they've never imitated someone else or lied about themselves for their own gratification while on the internet).The ending deserves it's own mention. 3 versions were filmed, one for each of the main characters. The fact that by the end of the film there was still enough undecided that this was a practical consideration speaks for itself - was there really so little plot development in the film that the three people who spent most of their rime on screen could have been a cold-blooded-killer? In some genres, maybe, but in this type of film, this kind of ending should not be possible, and suggests indecisiveness and indifference on the part of the writer.This truly was a film written in an attempt to pander to the general public, and because of that it fails miserably.",Perfect Stranger
178,ryanjw1987,Don't you feel like a Vouyer!??,6,2 September 2007,"So, I believe the point of the movie is not to be only an erotic thriller as others have claimed. It has a depth for which the average modern movie goer seems to have a distaste. The film seems to capitalize on the taboo of voyeurism and plays with our senses of what is right and what is wrong. It allows us to look at the scenario from different people's perspectives - the best friend holding unrequited love - the seemingly guilty bystander - the victim. All of these people have roles that we have previously defined in society. These people are guilty the personality we place upon them until they prove otherwise. The voyeur feelings come into play when you realize that they people aren't really who we thought they were supposed to be. We see people in situations that they aren't necessarily supposed to be in for the role we've placed them in. The best friend listening to the lovemaking session and engaging in internet sex with his friend, the little girl watching from the window, and the man watching the murder.... The filming lends itself to this. Take note of the angles that things are shot in and the way people look at the lens. You seem to be either peering from behind something or are being ""caught in the act"". The script does this as well. Where you feel as though you weren't given enough information, this could be because you peeped in in the middle of a conversation. This is not to say that this was the best movie ever. There could have been a lot done with the obviousness of some scenes and the downplaying of others but that could be due to explaining the background of a story without revealing too much at the wrong time, or making the movie extremely long.",Perfect Stranger
