0,TheLittleSongbird,Hopelessly bland,2,1 October 2011,"The premise of the movie, the veteran cast and a talented director were the reasons why I wanted to see this film, despite Taylor Lautner and that the trailer looked awful. Okay, I'll give the film some credit, it is not as bad as the trailer suggested.However, the rest is hopelessly bland. The direction is rather plodding and never really that focused. Abduction doesn't necessarily look cheap, but the editing lacks finesse and feels stilted and the camera angles often have a dry and frenzied look to it particularly in the action sequences.The music had some decent rock tunes on its own, but they don't always suit the tone of the film. The action itself is alright, but I couldn't properly enjoy it because the editing felt very awkward and frenzied, so any skill and intimacy was lost.Dialogue-wise, Abduction is awful. It is very laboured, cliché-ridden and doesn't flow very well at all, complete with pop-culture references that I agree will date quickly. I liked the concept of the film, but I wasn't engaged by the story. The more dramatic scenes are unemotive, stodgy and contains Abduction's most stilted moments, while the ending is anti-climatic, the beginning was cheesy and plot points are poorly incorporated and resolved. I admire films that deal with themes that people can identify with, with Abduction using isolation and loss. The film's problem however is that it doesn't do anything with them.Abduction's acting doesn't fare much better, with nobody looking natural in their roles. Taylor Lautner(he as an actor and the Twilight films I am very indifferent to) is wooden in a very irritating sense. He doesn't have enough charisma for the action and he seems very disconnected in the dramatic elements of the film. His abs look great but that's it. Lily Collins looks wonderful, but does or is given little else beyond that. Alfred Molina is a good actor, but not given much to do, while Jason Isaacs is wasted and Sigourney Weaver tries her best but hindered by awful dialogue and a character, like everyone else in all fairness, that I didn't care for at the end of the day.Overall, a hopelessly bland, derivative, poorly acted and stilted film. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Abduction
1,bkoganbing,That Martial Arts Training Comes In Real Handy,4,23 September 2011,"Abduction which is Taylor Lautner's first starring vehicle as a teen star has the young man with the perfect body as your not so average teen with anger management issues and great martial arts skills. Those skills are patiently taught him by the man who turns out not to be his father.Lautner finds a baby picture of himself on a missing child website and that turns out to be a blind. In fact it's a ruse to locate him and flush his real father, some CIA super agent out in the open. Both the CIA personified by Alfred Molina and bad guy Michael Nyqvist are looking hard for Lautner after his surrogate parents are killed. A neighbor girl, Lily Collins, sees the murders and Lautner flees with her. No one is really abducted in Abduction, but that's not for lack of trying. Also one very big unexplained hole in this plot is we never now who independent Black Ops operator Michael Nyqvist is actually working for. We do know they are ruthless.There are some similarities with the River Phoenix/Sidney Poitier classic Little Nikita involving teens on the run. But River never could handle himself the way Taylor does.Taylor's world wide legion of fans who find him drop dead gorgeous aren't really going to worry about the staying power of Abduction. But I'm betting he would rather have had a better vehicle to go out on his own after the Twilight saga films brought him stardom.",Abduction
2,Leofwine_draca,Eye-poppingly terrible,2,17 January 2014,"Conceived as an action vehicle for TWILIGHT star Taylor Lautner, ABDUCTION is an absolutely terrible film from start to finish; I mean, this goes beyond mere bad to become eye-poppingly, gratuitously awful. It's truly one of the worst films I've seen recently and the worst Hollywood picture of 2011.The extraordinarily wooden Lautner - an actor who fails to invest his character with any humour, charisma, or intelligence - plays a kid who's wanted by the government for some reason or another. Pretty soon (but not soon enough), assassins show up on his tail, but unfortunately for the viewer they don't kill him. Instead, we have to put up with an endless chase format, with faceless and uninteresting bad guys chasing an equally uninteresting hero and his vapid girlfriend.It's hard to choose the worst thing about this film; whether it's the stultifying dialogue (the script was written by a kid and for some unfathomable reason had no rewrites), the terrible acting or the insipid direction. It's quite a surprise to see some of the famous faces turning up at the trough for their paycheques; Alfred Molina should know better, but at least Jason Isaacs and Mario Bello have the grace to give the only semi-decent performances in the entire thing. Michael Nydvist plays yet ANOTHER stock villain (after MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL), but most disappointing of the lot is Sigourney Weaver. How far she has fallen!",Abduction
3,SnoopyStyle,Taylor just can't lead,5,1 December 2013,"Nathan (Taylor Lautner) has a troubling feeling that something is wrong with his life. With his friend Karen (Lily Collins), he finds a picture that looks like him on a website for missing children. He contacts the website but the chat gets creepy. He hangs up, but it's too late. It's a trap, and a vast organization has sent men to retrieve him.Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins are actually pretty similar. They're both beautiful. They both have questionable acting skills. And they both need to prove themselves sooner rather than later. They certainly didn't prove themselves here.This is the latest John Singleton film. I'm not sure what he's trying to do. Maybe he sees making teenie films for the tween set is where he has to go now. I think it's a mistake. This is not really his type of movie.The premise has some promise. I like the set up of a kid with a secret revealed. The movie has some good action moments. I don't want to be mean about this. But I just don't think Lautner has it in him to lead a movie. He can physically do it, but he can't emotionally do it.",Abduction
4,Prismark10,Missing person,4,7 April 2016,"A change of pace from gritty urban director John Singleton who tries to go for a Hitchcock type thriller with a teen audience in mind. Singleton in the past directed a Fast and Furious sequel so he has a previous in this type of movies. Taylor Lautner is a teenage High school kid who whilst working on an assignment discovers a photo of him as a kid on a missing person's website. He realises that people looking after him are not his real parents and that he is a missing person. When he and his girlfriend, Lily Collins delve into it more, they suddenly find that his supposed parents are attacked and killed by ruthless Russian agents. Lautner and Collins find themselves on the run with few people they can trust.Lautner discovers that the childhood memories which always haunted him were true and that his real mother was attacked and killed. His real father is a high level secret agent that the bad guys want to smoke out as he has access to a list of rogue agents. The couple raising him were also agents who wanted to protect him. Therefore they raised him to fight and have survival skills in case it were needed one day.Veteran actors such as Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver drop by as people who might help or hinder the runaway pair.Abduction is an efficient action thriller with a corny script. Lautner does well enough with the action scenes and he seems to be doing a lot of his own stunts. He is let down by his dramatic acting, not helped by being saddled with poor lines. However I have noticed that he seems to come across a lot better in comedy subsequent comedy roles. Collins is there as eye candy only and Singleton handles the action scenes well and keeps the tension going but the movie is never more than average.",Abduction
5,claudio_carvalho,"Brainless and Lame Story, Poor Lead Actor",4,9 November 2012,"The teenager Nathan (Taylor Lautner) feels outcast at home; has nightmares; and is shy. His father practices self-defense with him; he has consultations with the psychologist Dr. Bennett (Sigourney Weaver); and he has a crush on his classmate and next door neighbor Karen (Lily Collins).When he finds a website with photos of missing children with Karen, he suspects that he might have been adopted. He also contacts the site and the attendant locates him and calls Nikola Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist) in Europe and the guy travels with his gang to USA. Soon his mother discloses that she is his foster mother but his parents are murdered by two criminals. Before dying, her father asks him to run away. He takes Karen to the hospital and Dr. Bennett tells him that he is in danger and gives an address in Pittsburgh to him with the names of two persons that he can trust on. Now Nathan and Karen are hunted down by Kozlow and his men and also by the CIA. The teenagers do not know who is reliable and travels to the address Dr. Bennett gave to them.""Abduction"" is a thriller that wannabe another Bourne Identity-like movie. However, the brainless and lame story has many flaws and despite the cast with Sigourney Weaver, Michael Nyqvist, Maria Bello and Alfred Molina, the lead actor Taylor Lautner is a reasonable and unconvincing athlete and ruins any chance that this flick might have had. Lily Collins is gorgeous and nothing else. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Sem Saída"" (""No Way Out"")",Abduction
6,nogodnomasters,TRUST HAS GOT TO BE EARNED,6,9 April 2019,"A boy named Nathan, who looks like he might turn into a werewolf at any time, has anger management issues. He boxes and wrestles to help control those issues. He also has a weird reoccurring dream which he relates to his shrink, who has an alien growing inside her (Sigourney Weaver). He is thrust together with his neighbor, Karen (Lily Collins) into a HS sociology project. They have been making goo-goo eyes at each other for the first part of the movie. They are looking up abducted children when Nathan finds a photo of a child that looked like him. He decides to investigate further.Since the title of the movie is ""Abduction"" we now know the bare bone plot. The question remains are the details and twists going to make this an interesting film? Yawn!But then all of a sudden the action literally explodes onto the screen. The movie becomes fast paced with a good rapid sound track. Nathan along with his traveling girl friend quickly develop the skills of a movie CIA operative while Taylor Lautner's acting abilities have remained unchanged. In one scene Karen is screaming, but her lips aren't moving...some poor dubbing. Nathan's flashbacks to his father teaching how to fight was very cliche. There is also the teen heart throb aspect of the movie, as clearly this movie was geared toward them.This is an action film for teenagers.Teen safe. No f-bomb, sex, or nudity...just some teens making out.",Abduction
7,kosmasp,Off to a good start,5,10 March 2012,"I did like how the movie started off. With the ""rascal"" Lautner (his character) and the mystery surrounding him. You get the wildest ideas (especially if you haven't heard about the story) where this might go. But as you may already know it gets pretty bog-standard after that. Lautner does his action-shtick and Singleton seems to do a for hire job after all.The clichés keep mounting up and the action scenes keep on coming (not that it makes much sense). Someone like Jason Isaacs might have been able to ground the whole thing, if they'd let him (but they got other ideas for him). Mostly for Lautner fans and people who like simple action entertainment",Abduction
8,jboothmillard,Abduction,4,23 February 2012,"From director John Singleton (Boyz n the Hood, Shaft, 2 Fast 2 Furious), I saw the trailer or some clips for this and thought it looked worth watching, so I gave it a chance. Basically Pennslyvania teenager Nathan Harper (The Twilight Saga's Taylor Lautner) is a slightly odd young man who lives at home with his parents, Mara (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) and Kevin (Harry Potter's Jason Isaacs), and has recurring nightmares that he discusses with psychiatrist Dr. Geraldine 'Geri' Bennett (Sigourney Weaver). One day while browsing the internet, he and his neighbour and longtime friend Karen Murphy (The Blind Side's Lily Collins) come across a website with photographs of children who are apparently missing and reported abducted, and using the ageing tool they see one of the children, named Steven Price, looks just like Nathan. He contacts the person who created the website to find out what is going on, but the person on the phone only wants to know his whereabouts and details, so he quickly hangs up, but of course the person phones someone in Europe to let them know someone on the list called. Nathan mentions this discovery to his ""mother"" and questions if she and his ""father"" are really his parents, but when she is about to explain the situation two men show up claiming to cops, but pull out guns and kill them both. Nathan knows that the people looking for him might to find him through his friends, he saves Karen from a house explosion, and they head for hospital so that she can recover. Nathan calls the police to report what is going, but he ends up talking to supposed CIA operative Frank Burton (Alfred Molina) who claims that he worked alongside his parents, and he tells him that he will be picked. Before they can get to him though he and Karen are picked up by Dr. Bennett telling them that they have to keep running, and she explains the situation with his parents, they were taking care of him for his real mother and father, and she warns him not to trust Burton. Now on the run the two ""fugitive"" friends head for the location she told them, an apartment in Virginia, and when they get there Nathan finds things to give him an insight into his father, and they end up having to run again after Karen calls her parents and Burton picked up. They also found the location of Nathan's biological mother Lorna Price (Elisabeth Röhm), but when they get there she is dead and buried in a near cemetery, and at her gravestone there are fresh flowers, so they get details of who put them there, it was a man called Paul Rasen. This man is somewhere in Nebraska, so with new fake identification cards they travel by train, but they are closely followed Nikola Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist), the man who was part of the website, and he has two agents on their tail as well. After escaping the train and running through the woods Burton catches up to them, and he convinces Nathan that they should talk, and he explains that the reason he is being chased is because his parents had a list of names that are of great value, and they now have that, and Burton himself is on it. After Burton and his partner Agent Sandra Burns (Antonique Smith) let him and Karen, as well as the terrorists get away, Nathan decides that he should phone Kozlow and make a deal for the list, as Kozlow says he will kill Karen's parents if he does not get it. So they arrange to meet each other in a public place, at a Pirates baseball game, and they do indeed sit by each other to carry out the exchange, of course Nathan is actually wanting to try and kill the man he is next to. By the end end of the film Kozlow and his agents are killed, the list is passed over to Burton, Dr. Bennett comes back to give them details about a new life Nathan and Karen can live, and Nathan even gets a call from his real father Martin Price (Dermot Mulroney) to explain that it is all over, but he will keep watch of him. Also starring Denzel Whitaker as Gilly and Ilia Volok as Sweater. Lautner is a little expressionless at times, but anyone who enjoys the Twilight films won't be disappointed with his pretty boy appeal, the supporting cast, particularly Molina and Weaver, do their parts as well as they can too. I will agree that it is a little flimsy at times, and the story is a bit patchy with its ideas, but it is a near enough interesting concept, and the chase sequences are certainly good viewing, so it is not a completely disappointing action thriller. Okay!",Abduction
9,blanche-2,bad acting brings this one way down,5,26 February 2014,"Taylor Lautner stars in ""Abduction,"" a 2011 film that can't even get the title right.The film also stars Jason Isaacs, Maria Bello, Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina, and Lily Collins. Lily Collins promises to become one of the great beauties on screen with some maturity, though that's not enough reason to watch a film.Lautner plays Nathan, a teenager who sees childhood photos and an age-enhanced photo on a website for missing children, shown to him by his neighbor Karen (Collins). The enhanced photo looks just like him.Almost immediately, the people he believes are his parents (Bello and Isaacs) are killed, and there's a bomb in the stove. Nathan and Karen go on the run, helped along the way by Nathan's psychiatrist (Weaver). Nathan not only doesn't know who he is, but whom to trust. There seem to be two factions after him.First of all, since no one was abducted, I fail to understand the meaning of the title.Second, why put Taylor Lautner as the lead in a movie? He can't act.Actually this isn't a bad story, if the acting and direction had gone up a notch. What is bad about it is that, without giving anything away, it concerns a stolen list of people who have had dealings with the enemy. Well, that was the plot of Skyfall (except it was a list of agents) and I don't know how many other thriller/espionage movies. Can't anyone come up with anything else except a list of names on which to base a plot? I guess this film was supposed to appeal to teenagers. Since I'm not one, it didn't appeal to me.",Abduction
10,BandSAboutMovies,Pure hatred,2,24 February 2020,"So this whole month is about flops. And this movie, well, it made $82 million worldwide against its $35 million production budget, so that's anything more than a flop. But it's also John Singleton's last movie - a career that had the promise of Boyz n the Hood ended with a vehicle for the werewolf boy from Twilight. Then again, he also made Four Brothers and 2 Fast 2 Furious, so maybe I'm being too generous to his promise.Maybe I'm just upset because Abduction is the limpest of limp action movies and has the balls to be set in my hometown of Pittsburgh. Then again, most of it was shot in Hampton and Mount Lebanon, two neighborhoods rich with privileged folks who look down on our town's yinzer soul. None of this will mean anything to you if didn't grow up within earshot of the voice of Myron Cope, but Taylor Lautner is exactly the kind of kid who hung out at South Hills Village or Ross Park before his dad's pals from the country club got him a cushy job so he could ogle and harass the interns, always a step ahead of you because there is no middle class here.Ah, maybe I'm being hard on Taylor. After all, he was a wolf boy. And here, he plays a kid with Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello as his adoptive parents and a kindly Sigourney Weaver as a therapist who maybe isn't all that kindly, but lives in one of those wacky houses you always stare up at Mt. Washington and wonder - who lives there?Soon, his kinda sorta parents are dead, his house has been blown up real good and Alfred Molina is trying to kill him. What's there to do but fall in love with Phil Collins' daughter and try and find your real dad, only to discover that he's Dylan McDermott or Dermot Mulroney?Michael Nyqvist, who played Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl With...films, is also in this. Perhaps this is out American take on these spy thrillers, where instead of sexy and fashion forward Lisbeth Salander, we get young Taylor rocking out his best American Eagle duds?This movie got the kind of reviews that I can only dream of making, with one claiming that Bert from Sesame Street had more range than Taylor and the fact that an actual abduction would be preferable to watching this film.Abduction and Lautner won the Teen Choice Awards for Choice Action Movie and Choice Action Actor. Meanwhile, the man who was once Jacob Black lost his bid to win a Razzie to Adam Sandler, who had the year actors like Cash Flagg could only dream about, as in 2011 he made Jack and Jill and Just Go With It.",Abduction

Said it all, really...",5,24 May 2020,"Now we've all done it - got the best ingredients; the nicest ribbon and colourful hundreds and thousands to sprinkle it with, but the cake just hasn't risen... Well this is the cinematic equivalent... Taylor Lautner is ""Nathan"" the all-American, good looking beefcake cutie who discovers that after years of playing happy families, his ""parents"" might not actually be who they claim to be; nor for that matter is his shrink (every good looking, sporty, easily-gets-the-girl kid ought to have one) - Sigourney Weaver. Curiously, just as ""Nathan"" starts to doubt his own progeny his ""parents"" are gunned down and so he and girlfriend ""Karen"" (Lily Collins) are on the run not knowing whom to trust, yada yada. It's really just a vehicle for folks to ogle Lautner - whose acting ""skills"" have always played a very distant second fiddle to his muscular looks; the rest of it - especially the ending - is just fluff with bullets. Alfred Molina stands out as the CIA agent - and, unfortunately, that rather robs the film of any of it's jeopardy. It's watchable while you're making a real cake....",Abduction
12,grantss,Conventional action-drama,4,7 January 2017,"Nathan is at high school. He discovers a younger picture of himself on a missing persons register. Once he starts investigating, he is drawn into a game of intrigue involving the CIA and foreign agents, where nothing is what it seems and nobody can be trusted.A pretty conventional action-drama. Has a degree of intrigue but this just feels contrived and implausible. Plot develops in random, get-to-the-next-action-scene fashion, meaning that not much makes sense after a while.Cast should be a give away that this wasn't going to be anything more than a weak teen-orientated fluff piece. While we do have the gravitas of such great performers as Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina, we also have the talentless Taylor Lautner in the lead role. Clearly just there for his muscles and to get the moronic Twilight fans to watch the movie, he really doesn't help the movie. What little credibility it had disappeared once he was cast and he lives up to the reputation, giving a very wooden performance. Lily Collins plays the love interest and puts in a solid performance, especially considering the (weak) material she had to work with.Sad that John Singleton's career has come to this. Considering that he directed Boyz n the Hood and Higher Learning, two great social commentaries, this movie is truly beneath him.",Abduction
13,anaconda-40658,How Did Lily Collins Free Herself?,4,10 September 2015,"Abduction (2011): Dir: John Singleton / Cast: Taylor Lautner, Lily Collins, Alfred Molina, Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs: Here is an action film about the abduction of identity. Taylor Lautner plays a teenager who discovers that his parents are not for real and that he is a missing person. His supposed parents are attacked and murdered and Lautner is on the run with his girlfriend who was over for a school project. Lautner fares okay as someone struggling to figure out who he is. He learns that his mother was murdered when he was young and his mind blocked it out. His father is a secret agent who stayed out of sight. The couple raising him were agents, as is his therapist who assists in his getaway. John Singleton has made such provocative films as Baby Boy and Four Brothers but selling Lautner's Twilight fame is a marketing mistake. Those female Twilight fans will not likely be interested in an action film generally aimed at males who are likely not be interested in the whole Twilight thing. Lautner survives despite a climax that consists of ass kicking. Lily Collins is strikingly beautiful but never rises above the romantic prop. Her parents are conveniently out of town, and a scene where she is bound and gagged hands above head makes no sense when she shatters a glass. It is not indicated how she freed herself. Alfred Molina is flat as a corrupt agent. Sigourney Weaver steals scenes as Lautner's therapist who is actually an agent although her final scene is kinda corny. Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello play Lautner's secret agent parents who meet their end. Well made marketing misfire. Score: 4 / 10",Abduction

Or are they? He brings along a girl he fancies, and they get into all sorts of scrapes. Or do they? Singleton blasted his way into our lives twenty years ago with his phenomenal debut, and now he's directing a vehicle for the one from Twilight who isn't a vampire.And it's what you'd expect. A bland teen action movie, with no subtlety or common sense. But it's not a horrid film to watch. Despite it's blandness, it's quite watchable, but runs out of steam toward the final act.Lautner proves there is no life after Twilight with the exception of Stewart, and looks out of place whenever he has his shirt on.Issacs and Bello are wasted in their minor roles, and Weaver and Molina are just there for filler and a bit of gravitas.But still, it's the best thing Lautner has been in, but thats not saying much really.Or is it?",Abduction

16,gradyharp,Coming of Age for Taylor Lautner,8,29 December 2011,"ABDUCTION as written by Shawn Christensen and directed by John Singleton is not only an entertaining thriller, it also offers Taylor Lautner the chance to break out of his werewolf status and enter the realm of thriller/romance as a regular human And he manages the advance in his film career quite well. While the film is not without flaws in the plot and overdoes it a bit in the killing arena, it still manages to present a story that has more than one direction to follow.Nathan (Taylor Lautner) is a likable high school teenager whose friends Gilly (Denzel Whitaker) and Billy (Allen Williamson) share a rather dangerous lust for life. Nathan's parents (Maria Bello and Ken Arnold) are supportive: the father teaches Nathan martial arts, the mother runs a strict household. Nathan gets drunk at a party, is grounded, and when given an assignment in Sociology with his across the street neighbor Karen (Lily Collins) the two discover a website for missing children: Nathan's picture appears there and that begins the trek to discover who his real parents are. In the process his adoptive parents are killed by a Russian group and Nathan and Karen are on the run. The CIA chief (Alfred Molina) informs the runaways that they are in danger and must hide. Nathan realizes he holds a code to an encrypted number system and must retain that at all costs. The plots gets a bit confused when we discover that Nathan's psychiatrist (Sigourney Weaver) is also with the CIA and that Nathan is to pass the code in a certain convoluted manner, all the while Nathan is looking for his biological father and for some meaning to his lifeLautner and Collins have a credible screen chemistry and it appears that Lautner is doing the majority of the stunts himself. This is a tense hunt and chase thriller, and while there are some holes in the story that need better definition and a huge cast of hunters for the code being killed right and left and never seem to be diminished in additional help (!), the pace is breakneck and the ending is satisfactory. This marks a fine debut of Taylor Lautner as a lead man - and he is supported by a very fine and very large cast of actors. Grady Harp",Abduction
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Abduction,5,22 September 2011,"Could we be staring at Hollywood's next action hero in Taylor Lautner, having the young, buffed adult being the marquee of a loud action film, with never ending efforts to highlight as much as possible that he can hold his own when it comes to the rough and tumble, the camera rarely shying away for a placeholder stuntman? From spending lots of time sans his shirt in the Twilight movies, Taylor Lautner now keeps most of it on anyway save for the obligatory scene that has to be snuck in, to allow the young princeling to step into the shoes of illustrious beefcakes of the past who now only have roles in The Expendables franchise.Abduction is a misnomer for the title, as nobody gets abducted in the film save for Karen, played by Lily Collins, who becomes fodder actually, collateral and disposable as she screams her way through disbelief of being caught up in a web of intrigue far beyond her upscaled life of comfort. Her neighbour is Nathan (Lautner), the risky neighbourhood hunk with a suspect attitude and emotional baggage so much so that he has schedule visits to see a psychiatrist (Sigourney Weaver) in spite of having some of the best folks as parents (Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello), having a dad who condones violence in the name of self defense.For director John Singleton, things are kept extremely simple and in PG territory (compared to his Four Brothers) as Nathan gets to question his identity, where his birthright is something more than meets the eye, having some Eastern European badass after him as a bargaining chip, making his life a living held as a fugitive as he and token girlfriend Karen run from point to point trying to stay above their confused state of minds, and figuring out in double quick time just what they needed to do to stay alive. Trust no one becomes the mantra as they struggle to stay one step ahead of dodgy people from all angles, as they inevitably fall in love and were one minute step away from statutory raping each other, at far as their characters go if measured by the law in this part of the world.Expectedly, the story by Shawn Christensen has loopholes galore that just begs for your attention. For instance, it was a smart idea to arrange a meet up with villains (led by Michael Nyqvist of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo fame) in a public location, and a stadium no less with metal detectors and scanners at the point of entry, just in case your enemy decides to pack a gun to finish you off when bargaining for your life. But lo and behold, a metallic revolver got snuck in the venue in the first place. It's either Nathan has very powerful friends, or can conjure weapons out of sheer will. Then there's the constant, convenient help from best pal Gilly (Denzel Whitaker), whom you think the villains, always boasting about their network and intelligence capabilities, would have already done something to neutralize Gilly since they're bugging the entire world, but no, these details get let slip.Shoddy storytelling may be forgiven for an action film you may say, so long as the action set pieces are bang for the buck. Unfortunately I was hoping that Taylor Lautner gets as much opportunity in this aspect as possible, since in Twilight his computer generated wolfman moment always stole the limelight (besides his rock hard abs). Alas the filmmakers played it safe for fear of wrecking that Vampire Vs Wolf franchise, and I thought the trailer made the action a lot more thrilling than the actual product. The finale was one of the most anti- climatic seen where the hero flees and gets outside help that got dropped into his lap in a bid to hurriedly wrap things up. So much for being the alpha male.Lautner does his best to act, but all he can muster and master is the scowl, which I blame Twilight for sustaining this as a bad habit to kick if he has intent to expand his range of emotions. His abs when they come on screen steals his limelight. Lily Collins also does her best pouty impression and adds a little bit of unseen spunk opposite Lautner, and why Mario Bello, Jason Isaacs, Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver are in this, is anyone's guess besides needing spare change to pay the bills.It's not going to be a classic, but thanks to Lautner fans firmly set within Team Jacob this film could perhaps have a long shot at becoming a fanatical cult favourite for his fans who obsess with needing to see him in every conceivable film that he makes outside of the Twilight franchise where he obviously plays second fiddle in the love triangle. At least here he gets to ride toward the sunset with celebratory limp.",Abduction
18,StevePulaski,The awkward part is more than just the abduction,4,4 August 2013,"Abduction would work as competent, more functional action entertainment if it (a) wasn't so undistinguished and bland, (b) wasn't directed by John Singleton, the master behind the direct opposite filmmaking this kind of film requires, and (c) wasn't so peculiar and awkward in places. Other than those glaring issues, there's minor fun to be had here, if you're not to busy laughing at what is on display.Taylor Lautner of The Twilight Saga stars as Nathan Harper, an emotionally and mentally troubled eighteen year old with known anger issues. He lives with two people, whom he thinks are his parents, and tries to live a normal life even though these mental problems sometimes control his dominant actions. While researching for a lengthy paper one night with his neighbor and crush Karen (Lily Collins), Nathan finds a picture of a child he believes was once him on a missing persons website. He digs deeper into the odd coincidence, and discovers it was indeed him, and that he has been part of a convoluted CIA conspiracy/abduction practice since he was a young child.This could've been extremely serviceable-fare moreso than it already is if it would minimize the awkward instances I mentioned earlier. Specifically during the exposition scenes of the film, which takes up roughly thirty minutes of the runtime and are easily the strongest points of the film, certain lines of dialog and actions taken by the lead characters make for a strangely mood-killing, out of place series of cringe-worthy instances in the film that throw off the entire pace. For example, when Karen goes up to Nathan's room to research, she is immediately followed by Nathan's mother in the obligatory ""behavior yourself"" lecture. When asked if they want the door open, Nathan simply replies, ""closed,"" with the camera zooming out to capture Karen's definitely surprised and embarrassed look on her face.Almost immediately following the scene is one of Nathan and Karen studying, with Nathan leaning over Karen's shoulder, watching her navigate a website. Karen then looks over to Nathan's bicep, which is only mere inches from her faith and makes a notable ""god, what a bicep"" look that teen girls make in the presence of a hunky guy. Scenes like this are more fit for a low-budget pornographic picture; they are subtle, but questionable instances that don't really belong in an action film and are a tad shocking even if you're trying to set up a love-interest.But these aren't all the awkward scenes in the film. Without going into too much detail, some others involve Nathan breaking down during this mess, Nathan and Karen namedropping celebrity face-mashups while navigating another missing persons site that shows how a missing child may look now, and in another scene, Nathan's father remarks how ""hot"" Karen got since she was a little girl.Lautner will forever get heat for starring in the Twilight films, and to be fair, he isn't completely great here, but to criticize him heavily for just being in the film is too harsh. I simply view him as an actor victim to a flat, but lucrative franchise who will hopefully find guidance and direction in similar paths to other actors such as Channing Tatum. This is a speed-bump in a career that - optimistically speaking - will have a lot in store for him.The film was directed by John Singleton, which I honestly can't believe. He must've been in a highly experimental phase, is all I can say. Singleton is responsible for three terrific films, Boyz N The Hood, Poetic Justice, and Baby Boy - nicknamed his ""hood"" trilogy. Those films humanize South Central Los Angeles into a place where blacks are real people with real problems that have gone ignored due to rampant stereotyping and little humanizing. All three hit home on some complex emotional level, whether it be because of an event or a startling truth about Singleton's depictions of urban areas.The irony is Abduction is emotionally cold throughout its entire runtime. Its ending even falls flat on its face because there is almost nothing about these characters to care about. A half-hour devoted to decent exposition is disregarded entirely because the film feels the need to rush every instance and every situation without a clear direction.I am shocked (and somewhat baffled) to note that the film was written by Shawn Christensen, who just won an Oscar for his live action short, ""Curfew,"" which I declared my personal favorite after watching and reviewing all the shorts. To think that prior to filming that work of art he wasted his time and talent on a routine action flick is a tad heartbreaking. Not much left to say besides he seems to be moving in the right direction as of now.Starring: Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins. Directed by: John Singleton.",Abduction

It did not work.Abduction was an incredible rip-off and they spent very little time making it a movie on its own. And this was unbelievable with the amount of talent they had signed up for the film, including Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina and Maria Bello. No, of course I wasn't talking about the talentless Taylor Lautner.Sure, he's fine to look at, but that should stop at underwear ad poster. He cannot carry a movie and even though he's nowhere near as bad as his Twilight counterparts, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, he's just blah and probably should've just gone into porn.The movie follows Lautner's Nathan as he finds out he's a missing child and wanted for literally stupid reasons. He's thrown into a Goosebumps mystery, but luckily his non-charismatic ""father"" taught him to fight. How this movie didn't just land on the direct-to-DVD schedule is beyond me.

20,bowmanblue,The Bourne Identity (for early teens),6,29 May 2014,"I don't know whether I should be ashamed for liking this film or not. There's absolutely nothing new here that you haven't already seen (assuming you've been consuming a basic diet of Hollywood mainstream movies for the last two decades like I have).Abduction is about a boy Taylor Lautner (from Twilight fame) who discovers he is suddenly on the run from a group of baddies (you know the type - foreign accents, plenty of disposable henchmen and can only shoot bottles when firing machine guns at a teenager). Um, that's about it really. Taylor gets chased here, Taylor gets chased there, hooks up with a pretty young girl with big eyebrows along the way - that sort of thing.However, Abduction's big difference is that, instead of an adult being hunted by baddies who can't shoot straight (or overpower a fifteen year old), it's the afore-mentioned fifteen year old. And, baring in mind that there's minimal violence (defined by a lack of the red stuff when people get shot), this film is largely aimed at mid teens. It has plenty of pop culture references to Lady Gaga and Facebook that will amuse their generation.I couldn't really think of anything wrong with it. Okay, I've seen it all before and it ticks all boxes. It's not a classic, but it's entertaining enough.If you haven't seen this type of sinister-conspiracy-CIA-chase-type-film before, you'll probably love it and give it 5/5 (or just someone from 'Team Jacob').If however, you grew up collecting the original Star Wars toys and can remember when Transformers had nothing to do with Michael Bay, you may feel like it's Beverly Hills 90210 mixed with Jason Bourne and your score will be more around the 3/5 mark.Maybe I'm just a child at heart. I actually appreciated it for a piece of silly, chase-orientated action entertainment. Plus it had Sigourney Weaver in it - and Ripley rocks.Give it a go.

Anyways, it doesn't take Taylor Lautner long to get his shirt off. He sure looks good, but too bad his acting isn't. His acting is pretty bad in this and Lilly Collins isn't anything to talk about either. This is an action flick for teens. Lautner plays Nathan, a teen whose real parents are CIA operatives and his dad has made a bad guy angry. So that guy is after Nathan to use as ransom.

24,tabuno,A Decent Start But Descends Into Average Action,6,2 August 2021,"This action-thriller starts out with a macho, high octane teenage masculine adrenaline beginning with a father's penchant for the same (contrast with Ben Affleck in The Accountant, 2016). The dominate male stereotype presence in the beginning becomes so prominent as to possibly become off-putting to some. The basic premise of this abduction theme makes for a difficult writing script challenge in which the early portions of the movie are stitched together with both an uneasy unfolding drama and awkward humor along with a number of typical movie cliches. Then the challenge is the casting of Mario Bello and Jason Isaacs, solid reputable actors, as Nathan's parents. Both do a rather competent job in maintaining the seeming normalcy of real life for Nathan within the context of the typical family movie. Somehow the overall comedic tone of American Ultra (2015) allows Jesse Eisenberg's normal but mysterious character to thrive smoothly throughout his movie. But in this movie even without the comedic tone, the script does manages to transition between normal to hyper-action in a credible way. There is even an effective explosion (if not completely authentic) scene that rises above movies in how its handled. The subsequent action scenes are not embellished nor fantastic, giving the audience a better focus on the thrills of humanly possible action instead of special effects. But a little halfway the movie takes a familiar but unfortunately cliché naivete mistake leading to the typical have to a rather unreasonable scenario found in most horror movies and of course it has to be the ""dumb"" female who does this. There are attempts to salvage a continuing series of unbelievable surveillance plot devices but the decent quality nature of the movie descends one step with specific movie concepts that do not quite resonate well becoming more pedestrian and stitched together by a writer connecting the dots to fit a preconceived storyline that also has holes (like how can there be a convenient unsecured telephone line with Nathan?). There is even a weak ""summer time"" question that goes unanswered scene as well as the no-gun, disguise, no broken finger bones, even the less than effective self-defense lessons (except to include an action scene), and how inept our intelligence services really is in unconvincing build-up and lack of the use of facial recognitions when you need it), and why a physical confrontation necessarily has to occur (except to have another action scene) issues, and less than completely persuasive reason for Nathan's importance (Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, 2003 had a much more intriguing concept). The movie over-extends itself with a plot that does not retain its original sense of authenticity and oddly becomes more of the macho-adrenaline beginning and has a surprisingly disappointing soft landing. Sigourney Weaver presence and performance in the movie in helped to give the movie a comforting substance while Alfred Molina presence does not have the same intense impact as found as in such movies like Bourne Identity (2002). Even actor Dermot Mulroney gets a cameo role in the movie. Other movies to check out would be: Enemy of the State (1998), Wanted (2008) even The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996). Maybe it is a small complaint or not but the lead character Taylor Lautner has a strange squinty looking face with his eyes, somehow out of character as a leading action figure for movies.",Abduction
25,The-Sarkologist,"Not bad, but not outstandingly brilliant either",7,14 October 2011,"Well, this movie was okay, but nowhere near as good as Hanna or Chuck. I say this because this is basically a spy film about a teenager who discovers that his entire family is connected with the spy world, and that he had been trained from a very young age to defend himself when the time comes to defend himself. As it turns out, everybody that he is connected to (with the exception of the girl and his school friends) are all connected to the spy world, and the bad guys want him because he holds the key to them getting what they want.The premise sounded interesting in that while doing a research project on abducted children he comes across a photo of himself on a webpage and decides to dig deeper. Unfortunately this alerts his enemies to his location and suddenly his quiet suburban American home life is turned upside down. The people he thought were his mum and dad turn out not to be, and are killed, and he is now on the run, with the girl from across the road, from numerous enemies that he cannot even quantify.I guess this is a sort of coming of age movie where our hero begins the movie at a teenage party and ends up not so much saving the world, but rather solving the mystery that he was thrust into the middle of and outwitting the bad guys. He finishes the film an adult, with the girl, and with a choice. While at the beginning he is in therapy, it turns out that his therapist was one of the many handlers that were keeping an eye on him. Further, it is a sort of 'like father like son' type film where the father is a high level secret agent, and our hero turns out to have inherited a number of similar qualities. However, while I did enjoy the film, it is not one that I am going to rush out and obtain simply to see it again. I've seen it once and that will probably do it for me.",Abduction

In order to enjoy this movie one must suspend the Team Jacob identity. Yes, it is a tough one to handle because there are times one would expect Nathan to turn into a wolf and take care of business. The problem is that he continues to give that scowling look (before turning into the wolf) throughout the story like he did in the Twilight Series. This is a vehicle for Lautner to become, in time, the next Matt Damon with Jason Bourne expectations. And, it is also a vehicle for Lautner's introduction to star in his own movie. Have to start somewhere. (Now, with all that out of the way, how was this movie?) Okay, not bad, watchable and the acting was somewhat tentative by Lautner. And, he must have gone to the Kristen Stewart school of acting that only permits one or two facial expressions per movie. He'll learn in time and show us his ranges. The rest of the cast were spot on. The action scenes were good and I am not sure if CGI was involved, but it didn't look like it. However, the fight scenes were so downright real and brutal, I checked into the hospital ER anyway, just in case. (That it?) Not exactly. After Nathan makes that phone call to the missing person web site, bad guy Koslow (Nyqvist), now knows where he is and he wants Nathan in order to get to Martin Price (Mulroney), who has something Koslow desperately wants. So most of the movie is Nathan and girl friend Karen (Collins) on the run not knowing who to trust and that includes the CIA. Attempts at tension and suspense were subdued, probably caused by the too fast pacing for many of the scenes. Nothing was allowed to build. (Now, who was abducted?)

36,TheUnknown837-1,Self-delusional hokum and ennui blended with a fountain of unintentional laughs,3,15 January 2012,"There is a difference - a monstrous difference - between being childlike and being young at heart. Now it is a wonderful thing to be young at heart, but it is a bad thing to be childlike. Worse still is not being able to differentiate between the two, which can probably be said of Shawn Christensen, the writer for one of the most incompetent and hopelessly misguided so-called action movies I've ever seen. It is called ""Abduction"" and it stars up-and-coming teen idol Taylor Lautner as a rough-and-tough high school student with temper tantrum issues. He's a good kid at heart, so he vents his anger problems by seeing a shrink, wrestling, and getting the tar beaten out of him by his father for staying out late.But as it turns out, young Mr. Lautner has been living with strangers. Get this. He gets assigned a partner for writing a research paper on child abductions. His partner just happens to be the pretty cheerleader (Lily Collins) he has always had a crush on. They both like each other, but do not have the nerve to make a move. That is until they discover Mr. Lautner's baby picture on a missing-child's website. The plot thickens, and takes turns for the wildly ridiculous, when bad guys show up at the house, his parents turn out to be CIA agents assigned to guard him, and Mr. Lautner and Miss Collins are forced to go on the run while they (and we, the audience) try to figure out just what the heck is going on. Well, watching ""Abduction"" I think I displayed more signs of anger and frustration than Mr. Lautner.Shawn Christensen's screenplay is a murky retelling of an adolescent fantasy: running from bad guys and protecting the pretty high school classmate who you are deluding yourself into believing you'll be with for the rest of your life. So right off the bat, Mr. Christensen is delving into the territory of really bad ideas and unfortunately does not provide the panache and zest to redeem his premise. All children and adolescents have moments where they relish the idea of power over adults - even trained assassins and agents - but remember, this takes place inside the mind. It's a fantasy, and the real-life issue of kidnapping and missing children and adopted children who do not know they are adopted seems a little too touchy an issue to be melding with a silly fantasy.Even more silly is the plot that unfolds from this loony setup. ""Abduction"" could very well had been assembled from a collection of dreams, for that's how ludicrous it becomes, and how quickly it changes mood. Moments start off in a serious, somber mood and then laugh themselves away half a minute later, such as a moment in a cemetery. But the key moment is when Mr. Lautner and Miss Collins, having been on the run for a while now, are still running, and hiding on board a train. Rather that confront their issue at hand, they succumb to hot-blooded impulses, given pseudo-romantic dialogue, and start knocking over the set in what I feared was going to be the prelude for a sex scene. And given how careless the screenplay is with its subject matter, and its own credibility for that matter, I wouldn't be surprised if it had been originally planned that way, but cut in fear of parents' protest. After all, the target audience for this movie is the teenage minority.Mr. Lautner is wooden-faced and bogus in a role that frankly should have only been commanded by an experienced and immensely talented actor, and Miss Collins is hardly any better in her thankless part. Seeing either or both of them attempt to emote is laugh-inducing. But then again, maybe these two young performers are not to be blamed. After all, the movie also has first-rate talents such as Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver and they, too, are absolutely unbearable. I would not be surprised if their lack of screen-time was due to a clause in their contracts as compensation for signing onto such a plainly horrendous story. The movie was directed by John Singleton, who started his career with a landmark (being the youngest person ever nominated for Best Director by the Academy Awards) and seems to have gone steadily downhill since. He gives a lazy attempt here, showing frequent issues with jump cuts and continuity mistakes that really lash out at the screen like bullwhips. The action sequences, in particular, are dreadful with the camera twisting this way and that, in hopes that the viewer won't realize how limp and bungling they really are.How could this movie have worked? Well, should anybody have the nerve to tackle it, they should have transitioned the mindset of the movie from the childlike to the young at heart, or maybe beyond that to the serious. What would really happen if a child learned they were adopted? And let's say, what if there were really assassins coming after them? How would they really react? Is it too much to ask that they use some intellect and not their hormones? If ""Abduction"" has focused on elements such as these, it might have found the young at heart mindset that was done so well in, say, J.J. Abrams's ""Super 8"" a much, much better film about the lives of young people mixed with their fantasies. But as it is, hopelessly misguided and incompetently-written, ""Abduction"" just comes across as tedium blended with a fountain of unintentional laughs.",Abduction

I would say he was basically finished by 1997. Like Oliver Stone, Spike Lee, and quite a few others. At least Lee has done a few good films recently. This film could have been decent. Lautner was decent in it. He could have been a star, for more than a minute, had things turned out a bit different. Molina, though a great actor, just did not shine, and he was not a particularly credible spy.Michael Nyqvist was great, as usual. So was Signorney Weaver. The high school kids were credible too. I think the direction was loose, and the script did not have much to offer.",Abduction
42,MovieGuy01,A very good action movie!,8,8 March 2012,"I really enjoyed watching Abduction. I found it to have a very good storyline, i particularity thought that Taylor Lautner (Nathan) and Lily Collins (Karen) acting was great. One day Nathan & Karen are over at Nathan's parents home and Karen happens to come across a website which has lots of photos of children who are missing or may have somehow been abducted. all of a sudden Karen is sat at the computer and she manages to age one of the photos on the website. Suddenly the photo turns out to be one of Nathan when he was just a child. Nathan becomes really confused and wants to know exactly what is going on because his mother will not tell him. He then start to think that he may have been abducted, and that his parents are not really his real ones. The movie really kept me interested all the way through. The storyline was very gripping and kept me on the edge of my seat almost the whole length of the movie. I would really recommend people to see this movie as it has a lot of great action happening in it.",Abduction
43,troyputland,Silly nonsense from John Singleton,2,4 May 2015,"With the film titled Abduction we'd at least expect (or hope) Taylor Lautner's high school-er will be abducted. No? Maybe he was abducted before, hence the parents who look nothing like him but have different skin colour too. Nathan (Lautner) also miraculously knows how to defend himself. Convincing? Not in a million years. A lukewarm story accompanied by a enigmatic script awards Lautner zero edge and maximum cheesiness. Lily Collins, although very pretty and adept at acting these days, has little to do but gawp. Their romance is ruined by one foul line and an even fouler kiss. Someone wants Nathan dead, someone connected to his real father. He's wiggled out of hiding with his surrogate parents (Bello and Isaacs) by an unconvincing terrorist (Nyqvist) who wants an important list that's kept on a mobile phone. Cleverness doesn't come in to Abduction's vocabulary. Even Nathan's psychologist Dr. Bennett's (Weaver) balloon-camera cover-up trick in a hospital feels stupid.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",Abduction

There were some very ridiculous events that made me very uncomfortable throughout.
the acting was really bad in some scenes.I didn't like it briefly just a movie that you can watch without getting bored but it's not good.",Abduction
45,cosmic_quest,The Bourne Identity for kiddies.,4,2 October 2011,"I have to admit that I was quite interested in this film purely because of such names as Jason Isaacs and Signourney Weaver being attached to it. I should have known better when I also saw a trailer heavily featuring Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins that this was to be a teeny-fest.'Abduction' centres around eighteen-year-old Nathan who leads a happy life with his parents in a nice big house filled with Apple products. Happy until his class is assigned a project about missing children and Nathan then happens upon a website featuring a photo of a missing child who bears a striking resemblance to himself. After his 'parents' are murdered by assassins, Nathan finds himself embroiled in a CIA conspiracy and on the run along with his crush Karen.The main problem with this film is that it relies too heavily on the young cast of Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins and neither of them are solely able to carry a film. What doesn't help the younger pair's rather bland acting skills is the fact that both of the characters they play are not only dull but are as thick as two planks ('yes, we know the CIA/bad guys can trace phones but let's still use the phone to call folk!' or 'let's split up despite the fact we're being hunted'). Karen is also an utterly redundant character and there is absolutely no point to her other than to provide some teen romance.The one positive is that Lautner can handle himself in the action scenes, which again why he might have pulled this film off if he'd had a stronger actor to work alongside and guide him. In fact, they might have produced a fairly decent popcorn flick if they had kept the much more talented adult cast involved heavily alongside Lautner, for example, if they'd had Weaver or Isaac's character on the run with Nathan rather than the pointless Karen. But clearly the producers were not that bothered with making a decent film.Now I do enjoy a good action film but first we have about forty-five minutes of Nathan's boring high school life then we go from fight to chase all because the two characters are too stupid to properly protect themselves and make one stupid decision after another. In between, we are bombarded with messages about how cool Apple and BMW are (why does Nathan need a Macbook, an iMac and an iPad?).People are comparing this to 'Spy Kids' but at least the two wee moppets in that film were smart and interesting. I'd say 'Abduction' is more 'The Bourne Identity' for kids and young teens. They should have just rated this a PG and advertised this for kids because I can't imagine anyone past high school age being interested in this (other than girls only interested in seeing Lautner).",Abduction
46,FallenEye,Abduction: Recoverable,6,19 June 2016,"This movie is actually not all that bad. There are certain points in fact, that gave me goose bumps... Like when Martin called Nathan and said; ""Because I'm here son""... However, this movie contains a lot of Adult Themes, given the fact that the stars are supposedly in high school. It doesn't quite have that innocence it's supposed to have within all that chaos, you know, like with Transformers for example. For instance; where and how does a high school kid have the necessary connections, to have a loaded gun duct-taped to the bottom of a seat in a stadium? Also, the near sex scene, who's allure you could even feel approaching, long before the scene itself, because the movie's tone, is of kids doing adult stuff. This isn't really a complaint, and I don't really have a problem with it... It's just that, I wonder if it diminishes the intended complexion of the movie perhaps, and also... You ask yourself; Why wasn't this script given to adults in the 1st place?!Lautner's acting has never been the best, so that's a minus, which is unfortunate for him - because this movie had a story line worthy of making this Lautner's ""Taken""/""007""/""Bourne"". However I have to say, Lautner's athleticism impressed me. Certain parts of the movie didn't flow, especially in the beginning, and I wish they would've kept Martin's identity a secret... That would've worked wonders for suspense and a successful sequel... While we're busy asking, ""Who is Martin"", the studio has made room for it to be perhaps, Gerald Butler/Jason Statham/anyone else, who can live up to the hype.Anyway, Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina were necessary talents, who brought some firmness, to what was otherwise, a flimsy, though still, not all that bad, action thriller.5.8/10...

They like different, not good. This movie is the exact opposite... it's good, not different. There's nothing exceptional about this film. Taylor Lautner's acting range is still very limited so I'm not sure how many more lead roles he'll get in mainstream cinema. He's still young so he could still become an impressive action star because he's got the skill set for it in terms of fighting and athletic ability but if his acting doesn't improve he'll just be another of the bunch. The rest of the cast did a solid job though and the action sequences were done well. Lautner doing his own stunts helped in that area. The story, while not necessarily unique, still developed well.

The genre of spy/action/suspense and drama rolled into one has run its course through the industry. With the likes of Alfred Molina, Maria Bello(gorgeous as always)Jason Isaacs, and Sigourney Weaver helped the interest, the wrong casting was the lead of Lautner who is just dull. The movie did move quickly and was able to hold interest throughout. The fight scene were decently choreographed, the action scenes could have been better evolved in the genre of things.

This I presume is aimed at teenage girls and the bloke obliges within seconds of the start of the movie by ripping his shirt off. The story is slightly beyond far fetched for example his foster parents simply give up their lives to protect a list? a college kid who appears not to be the sharpest tool in the box outwits the CIA, international assassins? never mind at least the dialogue was audible and it progressed at a decent pace.

52,OneAnjel,The only objective review,7,5 July 2021,"I clicked on this film thinking it was based on a true story. I quickly realized the lead character was the young man from Twilight. I knew he had become popular acting beside Robert Pattinson. But since I'm not a young person, I didn't keep watching because I thought he was a hottie; I watched because the film was actually interesting & moved along quickly. In fact, my younger self thinks Pattinson was the hotter of the two (and may I say Lily Collins would have been much better in the part of Bella). As I continued watching, seeing other bigger names like Sigourney Weaver, I found myself engaged in the story. Bottom line is, Taylor proves himself a viable actor here, although he could stand to improve on the lack of expression in his face. Although the action sequences were well-executed, Taylor's tender features and lack of personality probably has not garnered him more action films, & his features do keep reminding one of the reason he was selected as a werewolf for Twilight. This film is a great teen flick and is more than watchable for anyone who just wants to be entertained. Idky there are so many complaints that Taylor is presented as a sex-symbol -- Hollywood has been filled with them for decades. There are plenty who never could act but who are now household names. At least here we actually see decent acting (and no musical interludes).",Abduction
53,Jonathon_Natsis,Just refuses to admit it's a B-movie.,3,23 September 2011,"Let me open with what any film review should address: I did not enjoy this movie. But first, a disclaimer: despite my reasons, I want to assure you that none of my negative points will verbally lambast lead actor Taylor Lautner just because 'he's some guy from Twilight.' Nor will I make scalding reference to his gratuitous lack of upper body wear; the kind that one would hope comes off as witty commentary but ends up sounding more like an awkward combination of contempt and jealousy. So, with that out of the way, let's get started.When the shy but short-tempered Nathan (Lautner) is paired up with girl next door Karen (Lily Collins) for a school research assignment, he is shocked to find an image of his younger self on a 'missing persons' website, prompting him to question everything he thought was normal about his life. When the cover is blown, he and Karen find themselves on the run, unable to trust anyone in their search for the truth.Not only will I not target any more of this review towards Lautner personally, I will even concede that he does his best on what is otherwise a sinking ship from the opening scene. Naturally, his acting skills do need refinement, and I expect we're not looking at the next De Niro here, but his occasionally lackluster delivery is simply a branch of a much bigger problem- the script.As an unapologetic actioner, it should be expected that Abduction possesses some of the clunky dialogue clichés associated with the genre. These include, but are not limited to 'trust has to be earned', 'I'm not leaving without her' and perennial favourite 'waithow do you know my name?', which is actually used more than once. But among these tired expressions is a handful of headscratchers; lines intended to act as cool quips but possessing an undoubtedly cringe-worthy aftertaste. For example, after Gerry (Sigourney Weaver) helps Nathan escape using balloons to cover security cameras (a la Ocean's Eleven) she releases them with the deadpan, utterly serious line of 'I hate balloons'. So you see my point.The set pieces are just as ludicrous, asking the viewer to buy into the movie too much when we have not been given any reason to engage with the plot in the first place. In one instance, we bear witness to a CIA agent (operating undercover as a suburban housewife) easily take out two trained assassins. The climax set at a baseball game is a storytelling train wreck, fraught with inconsistencies and overly convenient outcomes. At the very least, I hoped a film set in Pittsburgh would show some love for the mighty Steelers instead of the lowly Pirates, but I digress.General flaws in logic and realism are other aspects that can be attributed to this type of movie without having them become a major concern. Often, we tend to overlook moments which would result in serious injury for the hero in real life simply because he's just that, a hero. I'm also willing to pass these moments off, but in Abduction they occur so often, and on such a noticeable scale that they severely detract from any engagement with the film that could be developed as it progresses, and therein lies its greatest letdown.I commend the satisfactory action scenes, which minimised the kind of close-up, rapid camera movement that has drawn the bulk of my ire in recent months. Also, I was pleased to see the film show a bit of gumption by avoiding an entirely happy, alls-well-that-ends-well conclusion, but these upsides are not enough to sweeten what is otherwise an inherently flawed film.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

58,rawiri42,"Before you criticize, let's see you do better! Well worth watching.",7,25 June 2012,"I wasn't going to write a review for Abduction - mainly because I didn't feel there was anything much to say. For me, the movie was fun and worth watching. But it wasn't exceptional (either way)! I should mention here that I always score the movies in my collection BEFORE looking at the IMDb average and I must admit that Abduction did leave me a little unsure of what to give it. However, my ultimate criterion for the score I give is always primarily based on how I felt right after watching a film rather than on a critical and clinical analysis of such ""nut-and- bolts"" as the quality of the acting, direction, lighting, special effects and so on. So, with that in mind, I gave Abduction 7.1 - and only then did I look at the IMDb rating of 4.6 and that, in turn, led me to look at the reviews already posted because I considered it to be overly harsh. Well, people, I can only assume that all of you who have slammed this film for poor direction, poor acting and just about poor everything else are all Oscar-winning directors, producers or actors yourselves! It is clearly obvious that you could have taken the original plot and written a better screenplay and then directed it with young lead actors and won another Oscar! Come on!! In particular, Jason Lautner is frequently vilified as being weak, ineffectual and lots of other negative things. However, I would like to suggest that he played the part AS SCRIPTED extremely well. He as SUPPOSED to be a timid, teenager! People have compared him to Bond, Bourne and goodness-knows what other adult male super-hero action figures. Why? He is a kid (albeit a handsome one with a nice body) who's dad - unbeknown to him at the time - is trying to prepare him for what will (possibly) happen later in his life because he knows who Nathan (Lautner) really is. It reminded me of Johnny Cash's ""Boy name Sue""!Anyway, Dad (who, as we very soon learn, is not actually his real dad) very soon turns out to be correct in his fears for the young Nathan when the bad guys arrive and kill him and his wife. (I REALLY loved the way she handled herself in her final minutes! WOW!! What a capable woman! That was most entertaining.)Without wanting to spoil the story, we soon learn that there is no certainty at the outset as to who are actually the good guys and who are not (and that's probably the main theme of the mystery). Of course, we then have the insertion into the plot of Nathan's long-fancied but too- shy-to-act-on classmate girl (remember, this IS a movie and there needs to be a romantic element). Suffice to say that (step-)dad's training soon manifests itself in young Nathan when he is virtually forced to defend himself (and his girl) against ruthless antagonists and, considering his inexperience, he doesn't do too bad a job. But then I suppose all the 'knockers' who have vilified Lautner for ""cheesy"" acting forgot about that! He actually comes across very well as a young guy forced to fight for his life with no notice and I think he did so very well.No, Abduction is not a block-buster - but it IS an attention-grabbing adventure that does what it sets out to do - entertain. So, if you happen to be reading this before deciding to watch Abduction, please ignore all the 'knockers' who, as I have said, would probably do a lot worse themselves (be it acting, directing, or writing!). Don't expect the best action movie of the year but just sit back and be entertained. By the way, I am NOT a teenager. Actually, I'm retired!",Abduction

How do I know this... Because this films story - even though its not cannon or anything special - is good and decent. It's your standard action flick with a ton of good actors and some surprises thrown into the mix... Whats not to like? Singleton may not have created a masterpiece here - maybe the films purpose is to grant Lautner and Collins some time in the spotlight since they're both up and going actors. Maybe the idea is just to make a simple action flick or maybe it's a simple cash-in. Hell I don't know but I DO KNOW that the content here is entertaining and respectable. The acting is solid, the film doesn't look cheap in any way and the story - while feeling quite rushed and there are loop holes present - isn't bad. The potential is there though it isn't utilized to it's full extent. Having said that that can be said about almost every single movie nowadays... If you like watching a respectable but nothing major action flick with a bunch of good actors who all do their part well then this film is a good choice. Maybe some kind of Sunday night entertainment or something or just for killing time .. Hell if I know.

Stop throwing your hateful ratings all over the Twillight cast's other movies. Your ratings are anything but objective and you're dooming the films one eyesight rather than on content.

If he is to succeed, headline, lead and star in major blockbusters,, then certainly his performance in 'Abduction' clearly has made that option null and void and doomed! What a static poser! His expressions are so lame and stiff! What is wrong with these casting directors?

62,the_rattlesnake25,Abduction should be kidnapped from cinematic distribution...,2,8 October 2011,"Two decades ago John Singleton wrote and directed the Oscar nominated 'Boys n the Hood,' and a mere six years after his last feature was released, he has returned with what can only described as a terribly generic action thriller. 'Abduction' brings together deplorable acting, a terrible script and an unoriginal idea which is executed poorly. Viewing this film is the cinematic equivalent of watching a car crash in slow-motion, the audience observes the disaster and devastation unfold on-screen, but the only way for them to avoid this horrifying event is to simply vacate their theatre seat and approach the box office for a welcome refund on the admission price of their ticket.Nathan Harper (Taylor Lautner) is your typical teenage boy, but when he is paired with his long-time crush Karen (Lily Collins) on a sociology project, his life begins to unravel as they find his picture on a missing children's website. Nathan and Karen are left to fend for themselves as they find themselves in the cross-hairs of a major Eastern European criminal, whilst they must also decide whether or not to trust the CIA operative Frank Burton (Alfred Molina) who insists that he is there to help the young couple. What follows is an hour and a half of action sequences involving a teenage boy who not only manages to outsmart many experienced villains, but also the Central Intelligence Agency.Generic, conventionalised, and unoriginal, are just a few words to describe the narrative of 'Abduction,' it's incredibly surprising that Shawn Christensen's script was sold to Lionsgate for an estimated one million dollars due to its preposterous and unintentionally hilarious nature. One particularly terrible scene takes place just after Nathan's 'parents' (Jason Isaacs, Maria Bello) have been murdered, as an injured henchman tells the young couple; ""I'm not going to die herethere's a bomb in the oven."" Seconds later, they reach the oven which contains the stereotypical bomb with visible timer before the house is blown into smithereens. While this is just one of many examples, to give Mr Christensen his dues, it is not always the script that sends the film into an infinite hallway of absurdity. Lautner's performance also readily helps this aspect along.The young 'Twilight' star has so far unfortunately only developed two facial expressions, one which displays his tight-lipped macho bravado and the other is a wide-eyed smile. This is most evident in the scene briefly after they have avoided the bomb in the oven as CIA operative Frank Burton contacts the young man. Asking how he is feeling after he has just watched his parents being murdered, his expression doesn't change as he nonchalantly mentions that he is OK. Expressions, emotions and acting in general seem to have been excluded from Singleton's reasoning during the direction of this film, because even the experienced Alfred Molina, Maria Bello, and Sigourney Weaver are shown to be seemingly 'phoning-in' performances as they no doubt realised what kind of production they had unfortunately become a part of.'Abduction' should be a film which is written about and praised alongside the likes of 'Airplane!' and 'Young Frankenstein,' because it is the perfect spoof of the action-thriller genre, encompassing every single cliché together with a laughable script and incredibly dubious acting, yet the sad thing is, this film is not a parody, but it is instead entirely serious motion picture. John Singleton's latest offering does leave the audience pondering one of life's most difficult questions however: why was this film commissioned for theatrical distribution?",Abduction
63,Marc_Action,Aduct me from this movie please!,4,23 September 2012,"Teen sensation Taylor Lautner stars in this John Singleton film about a high school teenager who discovers his life is not the reality he thought it was. After seeing his face on a website for missing children, the comfortable suburban life he's lived for as long as he can remember comes crashing down around him. His parents are soon killed and he finds himself the target of the CIA and a gang of murderous thugs. He goes on the run and learns that his parents were not really his parents, but rather CIA agents whose mission was to protect him. He also learns that his biological father was a former CIA agent that had stolen an electronic list containing the names of corrupt CIA agents from a really bad guy. The really bad guy wants the list back really bad, and so the rest of the film finds Nathan and his high school sweetheart/childhood friend, Karen (Lily Collins) running from this really bad guy and the CIA. Ho-Hum.If you saw the previews for Abduction, then you already know the film borrows heavily from the Bourne Identity franchise and attempts to paint Lautner as the next action hero. Sorry to say but the film comes up short and leaves one wondering why they spent 106 minutes of their life watching this. To be clear, the film is not horrible, but there are several issues that prevent it from being even mediocre. Oh, let me count the ways...1. Taylor Lautner - he's a passable actor when it comes to Fantasy/ Romance films. He's even more charming here in the lead role as Nathan than he was in the role that put him on the map - Jacob Black in the Twilight series. That's the problem, Lautner is too charming and is more than a tad bit in over his head here in an action film. 2. The whole CIA thing is a long played-out plot element. Can we honestly get anything new out of this type of storyline? So there's a list of corrupt CIA agents, you say? How original! Why is there always a list? Anyway, I find it rather hard to fathom why CIA agents and bad guys in films like this are always portrayed as a group of people who obviously have no life outside of sitting around in some type of command center 24/7, trying to track every move of the lead character. Did I mention the speed at which they tap into random building surveillance cameras (that likely aren't linked to an external network in the first place)? How about their ability to take over a 9-1-1 call when they don't even know where their target is? It's just unbelievable, even in today's NSA-snooping society. 3. The overall plot - The story is a little slow to pick up, but once it does the action is decent enough; however, stupid plot elements begin to pile up very quickly from this point on. Writer Shawn Christensen does a sloppy job. There are several pieces of the story introduced that only serve as a way to move the plot along. There are too many loose ends remaining at the end of the movie and a few things occur that just aren't logical. By the time the credits role anyone with 1/4 a brain just won't believe the CIA went through that much trouble to hide a boy for years who, in the end, didn't even have access to the electronic list (and honestly, if you think about it, he never really should have) until well after the thugs came looking for him.",Abduction
64,hthbrr2,"Messy, non-sense making ""movie""",1,27 December 2011,"Spoilers!I wanted to watch this movie just out of sheer boredom. I thought to myself; ""How bad could it be?"" It was so bad that after I was done watching it my head was spinning with confusion.The reason I was so confused was because I did not know what I had just watched. I had hoped it would be a fun movie AT LEAST; comedy, action, romance. But it was instead a mishmash of nonsense. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING made sense in this movie; the setup, the character motivations, the characters themselves, the time frame, the ""plot"" ""twists"", the ending.So the setup is that this guy is not sure if his parents are his real parents. Is this guy stupid!? He looks NOTHING like EITHER of them! Wow! His skin is darker than them too! And what a cheap way for him to happen upon this website that shows him he was adopted. It was a class assignment! Wow!Now to the character motivations. So these two adoptive parents spent THEIR WHOLE LIVES to kept this kid secret so that some list would not get out? They died for that? And this guy who was adopted what does he care? His fake parents are loving, and he is living a great life!Now the characters themselves. How in the HELL can this adopted guy NOT have the CONFIDENCE to talk to this uni-browed girl? He is beyond in- shape, happy, social, on teams, etc... But he is ""awkward"" with the ladies? Huh? And what's so special about this girl? Also when they killed his adoptive parents how did no one come to help? This seems like a wealthy neighborhood. They have NO security!? NO ONE cares? You'd think that TWO CIA agents would invest in SOME kind of security. They raised this kid! They have had just about TWO DECADES to prepare for this. But did they? No. None of these people make sense.Time frame: this movie, after the adoptive parents are killed, seems to take place in two days. They sleep near some river then the rest of the movie takes place in daylight. During the credits we see the guy and the girl limping off into the sunset. OK... so, they ran away to a hospital, then went to some house, then on a train - going where? It's never really explained. Then it's like noon in the stadium, they run around and suddenly a couple of HOURS have passed. Can't be more than an hour. Not much occurs as the whole thing was a chase then a small convo, so it's fast.Now to the so called ""plot"" ""twists."" I put them in quotations since there really is no plot for this movie. Check the summary on IMDb it just DESCRIBES the first half of the movie! All that happens in this movie is that it jumps from one insane thing to another. First we think this guy is a daredevil. Next we see he is a drunk. Next we are told he can't talk to girls. Now we are led to believe he is a nice guy. Then he becomes a target for a worldwide conspiracy. He could not even defeat his adoptive father but now we must believe he can kick @$$ and take names. Earlier in the movie the girl tells the guy that she is not doing all the work for the group project. Meaning he is a stupid slacker, but we are next to believe that he is a master of mind games and ruffing it. We are to believe that he can outwit and outrun: the CIA, the police, professional hit men, and a group of hackers. Throughout the movie we are led to believe that the world is against this boy. Yet the end wraps up so nicely that you are left saying WTF!? So this ONE guy is the only corruption? Umm, what? So they just take him away at the end? No handcuffs even?It really seems as if the writers wrote the movie AS they were shooting it. In this age of twitter, exclusives, scoops, gossip mags, leaks, and paparazzi were the creators worried that the plot might leak so they wrote it as they went!? Or were they just lazy? Because if you were to watch the movie again NONE of what happened will make sense. I would like to re-watch the movie to make sure. But the acting was so HORRIBLE that it's not even worth it!",Abduction
65,jcallows,how the mighty have fallen,6,18 August 2013,"How did Sigourney Weaver end up in this? And Alfred Molina too? He was headed in the right direction when he took that huge role in Spider-Man 2 after not capitalizing on the success of his role in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Now he just took a step back into obscurity. This film was even beneath Maria Bello. With a fairly decent supporting cast and a decent director in John Singleton, you'd expect at least a decent film, despite Taylor what's-his-face. But this film managed to beat the odds and stank. This film was a derivative of many films. It even lifted lines directly from a little known 90's film called Sneakers. I guess the writers thought nobody would remember that movie. But, unfortunately, I did because Sneakers, unlike this one, was a pretty good and actually an underrated film.Besides some obvious similarities to a certain Matt Damon series of films, this film did have potential. And it did have a few good action sequences. Because of this, it did take me away from my texting and video gaming every now and then and brought my attention back to the movie.",Abduction
66,ptsj-music,Sadly Bad,2,13 February 2017,"Sorry, Taylor Lautner, but your parody of a college look doesn't help very much to making this a good movie, even though your acting is some of the best in this show. It takes about half an hour with silly and pointless presentation of the main characters to get to some point in the plot, and from then on - very few surprises, if any. Movies with a cast on this level normally get saved by some good acting, but this is low quality all the way. BMW can't have been too satisfied with their brand placement. It's actually sad to see what used to be very good actors, like Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver, waste their talent on this. Are roles hard to get? Something went wrong in the directing. You can actually see that they're trying hard not to overact, as they are told to on the set. And the great Swedish actor, Michael Nyquist, seems to have ended up as playing only super mean and no brained bad guys with four lines per film. So much for having a scarred face and crazy eyes. John singleton must be very pretentious, and it doesn't work. It's just sadly bad. I give it two stars just because I got sympathy for the crew.",Abduction
67,mharah,Wow! The Haters sure came down on this one!,5,20 October 2018,"Okay, it's not a great film. What was John Singleton thinking? I can see why Taylor Lautner did it, however. Change of pace, great director, good cast. But I'm a little puzzled as to why Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs thought they needed to take it - to work with John Singleton probably. Maria Bello and Alfred Molina? Well, they both do seem to turn up in mediocre stuff as well as the good ones all too often, don't they? That having been said - sorry, Haters - this was not bad. 5 out of 10. The pacing was good, the cast acquitted themselves intelligently, the production elements were satisfactory. Stop hating on Taylor, guys and gals. Twilight was an anomaly. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it was Twilight - a category all its own: Romantic drivel, unless you like that sort of thing. But the Twilight cast - Lautner, Stewart and Pattinson deserve to be judged apart from that. So far, Taylor has been just okay. His biggest problem is that he keeps getting cast in films he shouldn't be doing. I'm not advocating type-casting as a rule, but an actor needs to start out doing what he can do well, expanding his talent little by little. Taylor is not a natural, but he seems to learn quickly if only given a chance. That doesn't - for now, at least - include blue collar roles, action star roles, tough guys roles. Taylor is a nice, Upper Middle Class guy. He needs to capitalize on that and on Twilight - romantic leads - quiet, intense, proud, probably a little soft. (Sure, get his clothes off. That's part of what he does well, and there's no reason to hide ii ) So far, he has tried roles he really isn't ready for. (Valentine's Day was a good idea.) As for the script, it needed work. Quite a bit of lame dialogue and contorted plot twists. This could have been remedied, especially since the script was apparently well enough regarded to make the top of The Black List.

70,MosHr,Somehow manages to feel low-budget,5,18 September 2011,"I saw this movie at the 20 city live red carpet cast premiere. Even though the movie has lots of talented cast like Mario Bello, Jason Issacs, Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina - the movie and the poster squarely focuses on Taylor Lautner. The red carpet talk was about his martial arts background and the numerous cuts and bruises everyone had suffered during the filming process. I was expecting an stunt based, action oriented movie; even more by the talk and comparisons made to the Bourne Identity Matt Damon and Mission Impossible Tom Cruise.First and foremost, the writing is sloppy, the story is riddled with weak dialog and clichés, tones changes on a whim - there isn't much more to the plot than what's given in the trailer - a missing children website leading to the world of guns, secret agents, CIAs etc etc. This movie continues a trend in modern CSI-CIA-crime writing; a lack of understanding of the basic principles of technology and I guess it won't bother most people but for me the whole plot seemed rather forced.The most disappointing thing was that the action never felt like a high grade action movie. The much vaunted stunts came out as weak and the fights were just basic B-movie stuff that would have been acceptable in an early 90s action movie. There are no big car chases and the big stadium final set-piece is bit anti-climatic since the writing couldn't cover up the basic lack of oomph in it. This is even more surprising since the director John Singleton's last movie is the ultra-violent ""Four Brothers"".The man Taylor Lautner himself does his thing and manages to not look like turning into a werewolf every time. He doesn't impress with his acting or his martial arts; which begs on why he didn't insist on a full team of martial arts coaches and stunt-men to make this movie into his action star vehicle. Lily Collins as Nathan's love interest looks a bit plain jane and has no personality; and doesn't quite create the chemistry with Taylor Lautner. The train kissing scene, which we were told would leave many a girls jealous, feels more voyeuristic and uncomfortable than jealousy-inducing explosive.I hate to say it but it feels like a quick cash in on Taylor Lautner's name and fame. Everything is so undercooked and cheap feeling with numerous blatant and obtrusive product placements that it's just a big dupe to get the Twilight fans and teenager's ticket sales before anyone realizes that this isn't a good movie.",Abduction

73,markdroulston,"As dumb as its star, but has a few laughs",4,5 February 2012,"John Singleton's ABDUCTION is the type of movie not seen as often nowadays as in the past: the action star vehicle. These films, which seemed to come in an endless supply during the 1980s action star heyday, usually exist for no other reason than to promote their leading man (or occasionally woman) and their often dubious talents. Here, Taylor Lautner steps out of his supporting role in the TWILIGHT franchise and into his first starring role as Nathan, the high schooler on the run from a past he knows nothing about. As is typical of the star vehicle, Lautner's shortcomings as an actor, not to mention those of dreadful love interest Lily Collins, are minimised by surrounding him with strong supporting players such as Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina, and, clearly having a blast as Nathan's 'parents', Maria Bello and Jason Isaacs. The trick works for the most part, with Weaver being the only disappointing exception, as she delivers her lines in such an unconvincing manner, and is clearly only in it for the paycheck.As colossally stupid as the film is, ABDUCTION moves along at a brisk pace and never feels particularly boring. There's a certain masochistic pleasure in watching Lautner do his best to display any kind of emotion other than broody squinting, and while at times he honestly looks like he has no idea what he is doing, Singleton gives him several opportunities to take his shirt off and show the only real reason that he's a star. Which brings me to maybe the most underwhelming aspect of this entire mess, Singleton himself. How did this filmmaker, the youngest ever to be nominated for a directing Oscar (for BOYZ IN THE HOOD), end up making this kind of throwaway teen trash? With the exception of 2001's excellent but underseen BABY BOY, Singleton seems to have moved further and further away from the initial promise he displayed, and ABDUCTION is without question his lowest point yet. In the right crowd, it is probably a fun film with plenty to poke fun at but, much like its star, is ultimately a vapid and moronic product wrapped in a pretty package.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Abduction

It looked like it had potential and I felt like it was a good time to break out Taylor Lautner, beings though the end to the ""Twilight Saga"" is near. I'm not sure were to start with this movie. There are so many things wrong, awkward, or just plain mind boggling that I'm just not quite sure were to begin. For one, there wasn't a whole lot of ""good"" action in this film. The action scenes made me feel like Taylor Lautner didn't do enough or he didn't do enough personal training. Some action parts of this movie just make you shake your head. Then he(Taylor Lautner) needs to work on his acting. There were just some parts were he made you feel like he could have just simply done better. This movie feels like it was a little rushed. The plot wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The plot definitely could have used some work. Even the sub plot is suspect. I know they could have thought of a better way for the two love birds to link up in this movie. I'm a little surprised this movie came to theater. I'm giving this movie a 5 out of 10.

77,sugar_daddyo,What the?,3,4 June 2012,"This movie suffered from a debilitating case of ""cash in on the Twilight mania"". From the opening scene of what's-his-name sitting on the hood of a truck doing 70 mph, to the shirtless scene so many commenters have already noted, to the overly long hyperbole of fake, but caring, dad beating the crap out of him to teach him some survival skills: the first 30 minutes of this movie was an obvious pandering to the millions of preteen girls who squeal at the very sight of him (I use him because I can't actually recall the actor's name and I am too lazy to click the back button on my browser to check as I type this).This was of course very surprising given the presence of other billed actors like Sigourney Weaver. Why she and some of the others would associate themselves with this script I am not certain.I can see the storyboard now. Kid being chased by both the CIA and a Russian black ops team for some valuable information only he possesses. Throw in a girl, some car chases, a few fist fights: OK not bad. I can see how this would make a good plot device. However, this one failed miserably.Maybe if the opening scene had started from the train this movie could have garnered some of my respect. However, that would require dispensing with the pointless back story. So if you try to piece together some of the plot points you just end up spraining your brain. That's how bad the plot is.Many have noted the similarities to Bourne Identity. Hahahahahahahahahaha. Are you serious? The only similarity is they are both movies. No more. OK, I'm done.",Abduction
78,eline-hoskens,"Pretty naive storytelling and sadly enough, not much more.",4,8 June 2014,"If you're irrationally fond of actor Taylor Lautner, you might like this movie. But even then, I would recommend you to create your own cut of 'sweaty shirtlessness' out of YouTube scraps. It would save a lot of time and would allow you to add the same exhilarating semi-naked scenes more than once. Personally I don't manage to look passed his huge potato nose but I remember having been fond of tanned dark-haired and brown-eyed types myself as a teenager so I'm not judging his fans whatsoever.If you're looking for a good, coherent story though, I would skip this movie. (Here I am again with another of my annoying story-centered reviews) The opening scene is already very irritating, and I'm not just talking about the shallow score. I believe the intended function of that scene is suggesting the main character is a borderline juvenile delinquent bad boy who prefers transportation by lazing on the hood of a car before crashing garden parties and dozing off in his own puke. He does not like to obey his caring mom and peculiar and slightly sadistic dad, who reminded me of one of my former martial arts teachers.The writers then introduced a school project to both establish his romantic interest (the girl across door) and to introduce him to a missing persons website that features his picture (and which turns out to be simple bait afterwards while he turns out to be simple leverage in a plot in which he has no further importance). He then loses his parents and home and is forced to run with his just as forced sidekick girlfriend-to-be ('cause as his shrink suggested him, he'd better left her in the car under her protection as she seemed to be able to manage herself). Then there's a succession of explosions, gunfire and chases to fill the rest of the plot. The whole is explained by vague and naive mumbling about a former CIA dad, a secret list of people who traded government secrets (that was in a cell phone Nathan had nothing to do with and wouldn't even have found in the first place if it wasn't for this unnatural plot development) and lack of details. I suspect that the writers did not know themselves how to tie this story together which lead to this faint infusion of a storyline. There's nothing really exciting about a story that revolves around a character who remains invisible and which flaws are masked by a main character whose only contribution is taking his shirt off once in a while, or is this a witty reference to the Twilight series that I missed? And knowing the semi-good as well as the bad guys have all the devices to track the main characters at all times does not add a lot of tension or necessity to the story. This movie is a bit belittling in that it assumes people only need a popular lead actor to appreciate a movie and that it considers its audience not smart enough to notice their attempts to cover the plot holes with a vague secret list of important names. It's also a sad waste of time for a great talent like Sigourney Weaver.Despite its bad reviews I gave this movie a chance. Although a majority of bad reviews does not always mean a movie is crappy (if you can ever claim this objectively at all), in this case I would indeed not specifically recommend it to anyone. But if you plan to watch it anyway, I won't try to stop you. See if you enjoy it for yourself.",Abduction

Most of it appears to be based on Taylor Lautner and his ""shirtless"" persona from the Twilight films. Despite being a prolific movie-watcher, I have not as yet watched any of the Twilight films, for whatever reason. Perhaps this is a good thing, as I had no preconceived notions of Lautner going in, and had no expectations one way or another.The drunken party scene was well-executed, and served a purpose in developing his character, being that his Dad challenged him to a fight (with gloves) when he got home, apparently to teach him never to let his guard down. Whatever people want to say about his acting (and I thought it was decent), he is a skilled martial artist in real life. Thus, the fight scenes were realistic, and we didn't have to suffer through a shaky camera trying to disguise an actor's athletic shortcomings, as is the case in many action movies out there. The casting was good (so refreshing to see a real teen play a teen). The cinematography is excellent. The final 20 minutes or so, set in and around PNC Park in Pittsburg, was a visual treat. Amid the action and drama, we actually get to see a few pitches thrown, and even a home-run over the center field fence. The film had a denouement, and didn't leave you muttering to yourself ""What the heck just happened?"" The movie had a few flaws, but those have been beaten to death and are exaggerated beyond recognition. No, this isn't Die Hard, nor does it try to be. (Even if it had tried, no doubt people would be screaming ""Die Hard ripoff!"") It is a good, solid teen action movie with Phil Collins' lovely daughter Lily as the co-star. Personally, I recommend it, for whatever that's worth. (Nothing, I know.) Seriously, this does not deserve the vicious thrashing that many reviewers are meting out. Is it blockbuster material?

Lautner is NOT an actor, he cannot act if his life depended on it. The problem, however, with this ""film"" is not only Lautner but everything from casting down to directing and editing. Not one thing was in tune and felt believable or interesting, it was as if a group of high-school kids got their camcorders and make a film for a school project. Beyond amateur from beginning to the end. The only ones who can possibly enjoy this are teenage girls (boys) who have a blind infatuation with the semi-cute Lautner and possibly their mothers, who haven't seen a decent film since they started dating their husbands back in the 70's.Save a couple of hours of your life and skip this train wreck don't do the same mistake I did... Go watch paint dry or something else more worth while.",Abduction
89,lalitdevraj,Not like Twilight,7,2 February 2012,"Yes, its Taylor Lautner, but personally I do not feel that this movie is in the 4-5 band. I feel it is greater than a 6, but less than a 7.Possibly it is an overflow of hatred from the protagonist in this movie being in the Twilight series which averaged down the rating for this, but I must say it is a good movie.The storyline is rather basic with minor twists, but the screenplay did augment the movie overall. Cast, except Taylor who is the USP for the movie, could have been better.Worth a watch as it does display the 'Thriller' genre as stated but at the PG-13 level of course.",Abduction
90,nickbassett1981,A movie that's as badly directed as it is acted.,3,29 September 2011,"Lautner plays Nathan, a seventeen year old guy who seems to live two separate lives. He is the popular adrenaline-seeking kid who rides to school on car bonnets, gets drunk at house parties, and has unspoken feelings for the girl next door, Karen - overacted here by Lily Collin. He's basically Mr 90210, with less cash.But then there is the other side to Nathan. Behind closed doors, he regularly spars with his father in physical battles that become increasingly aggressive and relentless. He also suffers from insomnia and bouts of rage, issues that he discusses with his therapist, Dr Bennett (Weaver) in regular counselling sessions. In short, he is a mixed up young man.And if life wasn't tough already, it's about to deal him one more major bad hand. When assigned to work with Karen on a project about missing kids, Nathan's life comes crashing down around him, when he sees his face staring back from one of the ads. Suddenly he has to deal with the fact that his parents aren't who they say they are, that his whole life is built upon a lie, and that everything he thought he knew, he didn't.It's no surprise then, that he is rather preoccupied by the time the bad guys arrive to get him. Men with guns turn up, Nathan does a runner with lusty Karen in tow, and what ensues is a cat and mouse chase across the country. It usually sees the youngsters get to one place, a phone call gets tapped, and then they move on. Then some foreign guy turns up to beat them up, they beat him up. They move on. It's quite straightforward really. Predictable to a 't'.That's not to say that it's not entertaining. Remember in the '90s, those action movies where the ability to act was a 'would like', and the ability to kick the asses of Eastern European villains was a 'must have'? Well, those action movies were EVERYWHERE. A corrupt government or body take on one guy who is pretty good at high kicks, and which typically ended in some mass chase-cum-action sequence, set in a massive public forum such as a football game or a crowded theatre.That is the standard of movie we're talking here. And if we consider Lautner's performance at that level, then he didn't do too badly at all. He may still have the acting prowess of Joey Tribbiani from 'Friends', but there's also something rather watchable about him.But, my guess is that this wasn't supposed to be seen as a B movie. It feels like a botched attempt to put together a Bourne movie aimed at the teen market. But the Bourne movies appealed to the teen market, so why dumb the formulae down? One of the big failings of 'Abduction' is that rationale and reason becomes so diluted, that you have to throw all common sense out of the window, for this movie to hold together.But that's the least of the worries. By far, the biggest problem with this movie was the script and direction which was absolutely diabolical.The camera work seems very lazy. When chatting with his therapist, the camera just pans back and forth, back and forth between Nathan and Dr Bennett, as if the man behind the lens is filming a wedding. Scenes in the gym with the Nathan and his pals, have so much happening on screen that you don't know who to look at. But with Lautner skipping up and down off centre, in a vest and short combo, you can imagine where my eyes were focused.The worst part - or funniest part, depending on how I look at it - was that you never felt you were watching a natural performance from anyone involved. It felt SO staged throughout. In fact, this is the first time that I have watched a movie at the cinema and literally felt like I could input the director's comments at every appropriate moment.""Taylor, hold her in your arms. Kiss her head. Now look up to the sky."" What makes me feel like this is more a direction fault is that it was not exclusive to Lautner. Even acting legend, Sigourney Weaver moves like a spasmodic marionette, and whilst she delivers her dialogue, there is no real emotion behind them.With lines like ""I hate balloons"" followed by a dramatic pause, you can understand why she might not be investing everything in to this rather underused character. But if she wasn't happy with the script, she'd have not taken the role. The romance between the two youngsters is supposed to be fledgling and, to give them their dues, there is chemistry there. However, when the pair aren't getting amorous, the dialogue is laboured and riddled with clichés that leave you either laughing out loud, or cringing in to your seat.Karen: Two days ago, we were high school kids. That seems like a lifetime ago.Nathan: That's because(pause)it was.As the pace picks up, Lautner actually leaves the cocksure Nathan behind him, which comes as a relief, and indeed shows some actual character progression. A few big bangs, and action sequences are thrown in to the mix and those also help to maintain general interest levels, entertaining the audience for fleeting moments in time.However the final denouement is a real let down. No originality. No risk. No surprise. The bog standard, by-the-book ending is as lazy as the direction and I left the cinema feeling a little bit cheated. If 'Abduction' had presented itself as the kind of movie that it ended up being, I'd have known what I was letting myself in for. This is a no-frills B-Movie. Don't let the supporting cast make you think otherwise.",Abduction
91,kowboykaziklibey,Writer(s) Should Be Embarrassed,2,27 March 2019,"Must begin by disclosing that I have no idea who Taylor Lautner is, but it appears this movie was for whatever reason tailored for him to star in.
Perhaps if Abducted had been intended to be a comedy, and stuck with that genre, I could have rated it more highly. About a quarter of the way through, right after the boring beginning, it did have me laughing a lot.
Also, I'm not sure if it's ethical to use a script for a movie that must have been lifted from a committed mental patient's delusional ramblings. Very difficult to take this movie seriously it's so full of holes.",Abduction
92,tcbently,Teen thriller,7,30 September 2011,"I'm usually a sucker for any teen movie but this one is a little strange. It's a cross between a genre thriller like Mission Impossible or James Bond (Goldfinger) and a US high school romance.The plot is a bit thin and I tend to get irritated by scenes where black-clad agents frantically tap computer keyboards in an effort to trace the hero. Abduction even features Russian agents with peel-off finger-prints to add to the run-of-the-mill spy genre feel, almost as if it's a follow-up to Spy Kids for slightly older... kids.However, overall this film held my attention largely due to the realistic performances of the two young leads who are given sterling support from the likes of Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina. It does help if you're a Taylor Lautner fan too :)",Abduction
93,ashhub,RapidReview~9,4,22 December 2011,I wondered at the low rating but by the end of the film i understood why~The lead actor was poor ~ he could only manage about 2 expressions ~ shame because the rest of the cast did a pretty good job in a basic but not terrible action thriller~Aimed primarily at teeny~boppers on their first date ~ with many probably giving it an OMG! ~ 10/10 ~ but for a 36 year old it has all been seen before only much better~Much of the film was mediocre but watchable (with some pretty good action scenes) but the ending was just trite ~ painful to watch and mawkish dropping it from a 5 to 4~,Abduction
94,JoySLeigh,"Gorgeous guy, great acting - this one you'll want to buy!",7,20 March 2015,"Taylor Lautner, to start with, who is best known as Jacob in Twilight, offers a pleasantly surprising role that shows his depth of character (meaning, he's not acting when he plays this part; he's sharing himself as one who's experienced what his character portrays.The movie, itself, has a solid plot, and the Director should be commended for successfully capturing us as an audience and in the way he chose to capture us by relating. It had this subtle hold on me, and I found I just didn't want to even pause it for a moment. This is a rare surprise, 'cause it's been awhile since a movie was that good and riveting. Best of all? You get to watch a total hulk become a man, in a tender, moving storyline, while blending the thrill of watching ""Men in Action"". Great movie!",Abduction
95,crazybilby,Awful... Abysmal... so bad it was funny,2,30 September 2011,"I couldn't help but laugh at how poorly done this film was. Taylor Lautner, aka one of the worst actors of our time has really tried not at all to change that reputation...He has managed to take his stilted, generic, or just downright awful dialogue and deliver just as you'd expect: bland, uninteresting, and pretty unemotional (his face is wet with tears, but his voice says ""what do you mean I'm meant to change inflection and tone?"") His performance unfortunately doesn't stand out from the veteran actors around him seem to be amiss as to how to turn around their dialogue and lack of character depth into something salvageable.There's no amazing twists or turns, no big surprises. The plot goes along just as you'd expect it, unless you were expecting imagination. I kept laughing at Lautner's bad delivery, at the obvious clichés or stupid plot devices. It gives its twists away quite deliberately leaving nothing for the end but a poor attempt at a tear jerking introduction of Nathan's father. Some things don't even make sense, like how Nathan keeps travelling - as he's on the run, he obviously is going to try and get out of the city right? - but he can conveniently call his best friend to come meet up with him somewhere to give him things (this happens more than once in less than 24 hours. Where did he run to? Down the street?) Thank goodness the CIA didn't think to tap his friend's phone!The entire movie seems to reek of an uninspired first draft.",Abduction
96,seamysmama,Fairly action packed,8,12 April 2019,"First off, this movie is not bad. It starts off slightly slow with Lautner's character Nathan coming off a bit of a bad boy; he rides on rhe hoods of cars, drinks to the point of passing out, and sees a therapist for his anger issues. To spice things up, he has a thing for the literal girl next door, Karen, that he doesn't pursue. Then, surprise! He is paired up with Karen for a school project. It's during this project that involves looking stuff up online that the duo come across a missing kids website that shows a profile that is clearly Nathan. He pursues this info, which brings the bad guys to his house, where they kill his undercover agent parents who really aren't his parents, sending Nathan and Karen on the run for the rest of the movie. The bad guys, the CIA - everyone is in pursuit as Nathan comes into some info everyone wants. Sure, there are cliches and moments where he is tracked in the most impossible ways where everyone in pursuit is only 2 steps behind. Some of it really makes no sense - but - it's entertaining. Lautner does a lot of his own stunts here, and they are pretty cool to see. Don't go into this with preconceived notions. Just enjoy this guilty pleasure for what it is.",Abduction
97,redmaxdrive,"Not an Oscar contender, but not all that bad either",7,8 October 2011,"I can't say that I went into this thinking it was Oscar material. I knew that it was most likely a pretty brainless piece of action fluff, but I went because I'm a fan of the main star and I wanted to watch something that didn't require too much intellectual involvement on my part. In that regard, Abduction succeeded admirably. While the acting could've been better, the action sequences were top-notch; I especially liked the parts where Taylor was able to use his martial-arts skills to near-lethal advantage. And Sigourney Weaver did more than I thought possible with her rather limited screen time. That's how good an actress she is. As for Mr. Lautner, I do believe that he has a bright future in action movies; he just needs a little more seasoning before the next time. To any moviegoers reading this: I urge you to ignore whatever negative comments you may have heard and give this one a shot. It may surprise you.",Abduction
98,pannpost,"Keep your shirt on Taylor, you've got a great career ahead",8,27 September 2011,"I have no idea why this movie is so panned. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've never particularly taken to either Lautner or Lily Collins to date, but I found them both personable in this. I wish Directors would let Lautner keep his clothes on though. We're not all 13 year old ""Team Jacob"" ninnies you know, we can actually enjoy a well muscled man with his clothes on! Imagination people, it works wonders. Anyway, about the movie. The premise is interesting, and I feel, fairly well carried out although I would have liked the movie to go another 15 or so minutes to really build the suspense more, I blame sloppy Direction for that. The actors all acquitted themselves well, but I'm getting a little weary at Mario Bello turning up all over the place as everyone's mother. I've never forgiven her for her painful portrayal of Evie O'Connell in Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, her accent was like fingernails down a blackboard - that was a criminal piece of miscasting. Moving along, I think any problems with this movie lay completely in the lap of the direction-less Director and Writers who should have kept the script tighter. I've read other reviews that said there wasn't enough action, I disagree. There was plenty of action, there was just more time spent on inconsequential's than background to the story. I gave it 8 stars which is generous, normally I would have give a movie of this quality a 7, but it needs a boost from the 3 stars it's currently sitting on. I actually think the cause of the resistance is in no small part because Taylor Lautner is in it. And not because he isn't any good, it's the Twi-cringe factor.... I'll be very pleased when the whole Twilight franchise is over and buried so we can all forget it and judge the actors and their future roles on their own merits. It was fun at first, but now it's just old. If Taylor Lautner can keep getting parts like this and do them as well as he did this one (those kicks were impressive) I'm sure he'll be making movies into his 30s at least. If only he were taller! As for Lily Collins, I'm now looking forward to seeing her in Mortal Instruments, I just hope someone does something about those ghastly thick eyebrows of hers - they're disturbing, and worse than that, distracting.",Abduction

101,Quiestar,Yet another celebrity exploitation film...,3,24 December 2020,"""Hey, that kid that everybody loved in Twilight is available for a few weeks! Let's pretend we have a great action thriller and sign him as the lead before someone puts him in a real movie!"" said the producers long before they had a film script.I remember once placing Sigourney Weaver in my top list of film actors. I imagine her talent still exists, it just lies dormant as she trudges through one bad screenplay after another. She and the film's lead, Taylor Lautner, must have the same agent.Lautner, noted for his role in the Twilight franchise, seems out of his comfort zone (as would any legitimate actor upon reading the script). 'Abduction' is yet another celebrity exploitation film that banks on Lautner's Twilight reputation and his fan base. Unfortunately, that fan base might begin to fade away if he doesn't land an epic role that proves he's a Hollywood staple.After watching ' Abduction, some might wonder if Taylor Lautner can handle a lead role in a feature film. Watching this film, one might be inclined to say no. I don't think that would be a fair assessment. How could one judge his abilities as an actor based on this one film that seems to have been made up as the director went? Lautner definitely needs a better agent who can negotiate better roles in the future or his fate will be sealed.Producers and directors of 'Abduction' tried desperately to create a feature-length story out of an inexpensive low-budget television script. You can almost hear director, John Singleton say, ""What do you guys think should happen next?"" after each scene was shot. Singleton seemed to come up with a solution to making a terrible script usable, as demonstrated by the introduction to an continually growing list of two-dimensional characters we don't know or care for; a unusually timed kissing scene on a train; more thugs with bad intentions, drawn out fisticuffs, and vague and outlandish conspiratorial plot twists that are necessary yet left unresolved and Ultimately, we get a story that's reminiscent of a child's game of ""Let's pretend!"" This is a tragedy no actor can overcome.Oh yeah, the female protagonist is the daughter of Phil Collins. She did well to look cute throughout the film. Um, yep...",Abduction
102,skyme,'Abduction' ...not bad & pretty much what you would expect,7,17 February 2012,"Watched this last night, and it was mostly what I expected. After a wonky beginning, it's generally a popcorn, action/date movie that's not exactly high-art. The film is not the worst thing you've ever seen - it's really just an escape, with a good production, and that's it.Zillions of reviews say Lautner was horrible. Huh? I really think people are just jealous. He was fine and didn't overact - he was sincere, fit the role & there is little reason to be upset.These reviews lacerating Lautner were like people destroying Paris Hilton from ""House of Wax,"" when in actuality, she was honestly alright in that. Not a big deal. Granted, I don't have strong feelings about either performer.With a strong budget of $30M, the film looked confident and solid by John Singleton, the film is a fairly easy watch as it goes along, & the supporting cast of admired actors (Weaver, Molina, Bello) were fine.Singleton isn't too flashy, and might just be cashing a check... but one thing he would do is make sure that the actors would have their moments, instead of too many quick cutaways.The story is kind of fun in the moment, but, sure it's silly when you think about it afterwards. But, mehh. It was fun. Nothing is horrendous about 'Abduction.' I saw two of the Twilight films and thought they were easy to watch as well & not really a big deal. And Lautner's disposition is somewhat similar in Abduction as he was in Twilight. I think that's alright & he fit the roles fine.If I were to complain about anything is that ½ of the fighting looked good, but ½ wasn't that great. Secondly, the dialog was usually fine, but it could get so dull/ cliché I felt sorry for the actors.Thirdly, the ending climax with the villain was just straight-forward; you really see it coming. It's not clever at all & it felt very '80s. Fourthly, some of the chasing sequences were good, but sometimes they could lack blood-pumping momentum. Despite the complaints, the film is still a fun adventure.I'd read so many bad reviews of this film...that maybe my expectations were low. But honestly, the film was fine and kinda fun.

And River didn't see the need to take his shirt off every 5 minutes to distract you from the fact that he can't act... because he actually could.And for another ""teenager gets caught up in spy stuff"" movie, check out Gotcha!

From the opening scenes, so many questions go unanswered.One must ask why include these scenes at all!Moreover, each of these scenes is filled with multiple incongruities that remove all traces of verisimilitude.While this film strives to be a sentimental spy-action romcom combined with a teen angst drama, it fails miserably on all counts.

Is this movie truly so very bad or do we simply have a bunch of Twilight haters amongst us? I hope there will be a time when we all can grow up and get over ourselves and jump off the 'lets bash all things Twilight' wagon and start reviewing one movie at the time because its simply unfair to incorporate ones own bias into whatever report we share on the www. Let's start over and assumeLautner to be a brand new actor with no association to vampires or werewolves and a small town in the beautiful state of WA. Suddenly we can see Abduction for what it is. An action thriller with a heavy dose of martial arts, cunning stunts and an unfortunately overused 'sexation' of a young man who admittedly acts rather clumsy with his love interest and has a few unnecessary kissing scenes which were in part also placed rather poorly by the director. Overall however Abduction is a good 'watchable' film which reminded me a bit of Bourne Identity and Wanted with the misfortune of having been aimed at a (female) teenage audience. And so we grown-ups have to put up with the unnecessary swipe of the strand of hair in the woods which he does for no reason at all and the odd statement of, ""hey, I'm hungry!"" just as things were heating up in the get-away train. All of the 'Oh so' dissatisfied adults here who claim they want their time and money back, let me ask you seriously, what did you expect from this movie?

108,SpiritedAngel,Surprising,8,14 February 2012,"I didn't go to see this movie when it was out in cinemas, I was told by a few friends who had seen it that I shouldn't bother. I now wish I hadn't listened. Although it starts off a little slow there were so many good things about this movie that no one seems to want to point out. Contrary to what most of the opinions I have seen in many reviews, I think the acting was pretty good; not amazing I have to admit, but its not the worst thing I've ever seen. The acting in my opinion didn't distract me from what was happening, I didn't stop to think about how Launter could have had 'better expressions' in certain scenes; but I don't think many people would be in the situation that Nathan was in and be particularly expressive. Honestly, I wouldn't be thinking about my expressions, I'd much rather stay alive a little bit longer than pause to express myself. Personally I see nothing wrong with Launter or the way he acts, I think many of the people who think he is terrible at acting just don't like him for some reason, probably something to do with not liking Twilight or not liking his character in that, but I digress. The plot is decent, there were a few things that I felt could have changed but it still worked the way it was. I actually liked all the different twists that other people think were there simply to keep the audience interested. I also liked the fact that the title made me have certain thoughts about what would happen, or what would be found out, and yet it was completely different. All in all I would say this is a pretty decent film, and people should learn to lighten up and not judge everything so harshly if there is one little thing that they don't like.",Abduction

One thing he doesn't seem too great at, though, is carrying his rather bulky frame. He hulks where most would walk, and there's actually something about his gait that reminds me of a particular gentleman in my old gym who seemed to spend more time working on his quads than he did walking on them.Still, what would Taylor be without his hulking bulkNice to see Hollywood still like their identikit female companion to run holding hands, scream at the bad guys, hand Jacob (whoops, Nathan) weapons on cue, kiss-and-hold in the quiet moments, and ask that all important question: ""are we going to die, Nathan?""Surrounding them are the appropriately menacing Russian bad guys, inept and untrustworthy CIA agents and Little Miss ""I'll do a small cameo for a big cheque"" Weaver. At times, CIA chief Alfred Molina tries his hardest to channel Tommy Lee Jones' Fugitive lawman, but doesn't quite manage to be the put-upon man of experience.The story is a dippy mish-mash of the action-thriller genre and certainly doesn't give you any of those 'oh hell' moments that these films really need to make your heart beat fast.Abduction is just about good enough to make sure Taylor will get another crack at leading man; just next time, maybe try a couple more topless shots, son.",Abduction

I will not be deterred from seeing something just because somebody says they didn't like it. That said, it was a good overall movie. I was entertained. The first 20 minutes was a bit slow, but after that it pulled me in. I didn't focus on the acting & rarely do. It was fun. My 17 yr old granddaughter streamed it & I just happened to be in the room. We both enjoyed it & had some good interaction with certain parts, like when Sigourney's car explodes & when the house exploded. I liked the international aspect of it. Everybody was after him.

None the less, I did find the film enjoyable and should easily warrant a 6 or so. Quite contrary to some reviews I was very impressed with the lead, Taylor Lautner, and I think he has a natural and honest way to him that makes even this kind of dialogue digestible. The problem is that this movie is aimed at teenagers and therefore lacks all dark or threatening elements, making the movie a tad to much Disney. The screen writing is a bit sloppy and childish, which further accentuates the b-movie quality. None of this is the lead's fault though, I mean what could he do to change the concept of this movie? Turn it down? No, even this movie obviously never would have been made if it wasn't for the studio wanting to bank on the Twilight popularity, I actually felt Lautner made it enjoyable.",Abduction

Think of it as a Singletons darkest, nastiest, greasiest career screw up, the one 10 Oscars can't wash off. Why this movie was made in the first place is the question we need to ask ourselves. To torture audience? To prove that it is possible to make a movie worse that Troll 2? To prove that in Hollywood you can make money with a pile of garbage? I have no idea.... So no spoilers in my review, if you don't count the movie itself which is a major mood spoiler. I honestly can't remember when I watched such a bad movie. It was, in fact, so bad that I had to write this commentary in order to save 106 minutes of somebody's life saying these words: For the love of all that is sacred; don't watch this movie. Don't watch it even if you are some weird wrist cutting masochist, because it will hurt your brain, more than a tomahawk between the eyes. The reason why Michael Nyqvist, an actor of a higher caliber, accepted to participate in this Hollywood farce still evades my imagination. If it was money Michael; believe me it was not worth it.",Abduction

The movie began alright, and moved into the thriller suspense genre smooth enough. Even the initial action scenes were acceptable. Then came the wall known as linear plot development. Things stop making sense, became totally unbelievable and I stopped caring. The leading lady looks like a petite fourteen year old with thick eyebrows, like a Russian bear. The make out scenes border on illegal voyeuristic stomach turning filth. She is an unconvincing leading actor. Taylor passes the grade as a leading man, but just barely. Then why did I give it seven stars ? Because the first half succeeded in knotting my stomach and getting me excited before the all too common in Hollywood, devastating mess they called an ending.

114,demma52,Baby Bourne not all that bad,8,29 September 2011,"Just walked out of an afternoon showing of Abduction, which I found pleasantly diverting. However, I walked in with low expectations, expecting a 'Baby Bourne' that would be slightly cheesy, corny and tweeny, as indeed it was, but so what? Having started out with those limitations in mind, the film seemed quite OK as a vehicle for the young Mr. Lautner to stretch a bit, despite the silly villains and cumbersome plot holes. TL is certainly gorgeous to look at and the camera indulges in a bit of excess adulation, but is he really all that bad as an actor, bad enough to merit the screeching reviews spewing out over the blog-o-sphere? I've been an acting teacher/theater director for 30 years and the 19 year old seems to these old eyes - again - ""quite OK"", with a genuine capacity to express anguish and determination through the simplest facial expressions. This is coupled with a simmering penetrating stare. In fact, not since Lauren Bacall in the Bogie movies of the 40's have we seen a more sizzling ""Look."" (Being a bit 'tongue in cheek' there) He can speak a line with truthfulness, simplicity and directness and is really quite convincing, without affectation or embellishment. Does he 'intone and inflect"" so much less effectively than Ryan Gosling, another actor of the silent, tough guy ""type"" who was so highly praised for DRIVE? Only when sitting across the table from a veteran actor like Alfred Molina, do we notice the disparity in depth and intonation, but then Taylor's only 19. His voice is also somewhat thin in the higher registers (like Gosling), reminiscent of a younger Justin Timberlake, who also had trouble holding his own opposite actors of the caliber of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Much of the review screeching seems to have been done by males offended that Lautner does not fit their image of the ""Alpha Male."" Pity he's so civilized. Pity, as well, he's just so beautiful. I suspect a lot of the rage being directed towards him is fueled by simple jealously. Otherwise, the criticisms would be considerably more muted and restrained. When people start to screech, watch out, the ego is in play. Not being a New Moon fan (walked out of the third one) and not being a Lautner hater (or adorer), I went in just curious. Could the kid hold his own? Yes, he can - in about five years. The script is hammy, not his acting, which is just fine given the limitations put upon him. There's something a little bit 'sick' about the animosity being directed against this kid at the moment. He doesn't deserve it. Gave it 8 stars just to counteract the haters, though it really deserves about a 7 in my opinion.",Abduction
115,sputnik29,Expecting and getting is far away from each other,2,2 November 2011,"The trailer awakes expectations which were definitely not satisfied.The story is assumable, simple ""constructed"" and far from reality or authentic...Bourne Identity I-III has similar background, that the main character discovers his true past combined with a story, which most people would believe and it feels real.This movie presents nothing. The starting was surprising, the mother fought like Bruce Lee :) Then - after short time - it became hard to follow the story because the main plot is diffuse. Many scenes with acting but without a message. Some examples of scenes perfect for cut:in a hospital, were they prevent showing faces into the cameras by balloons...when they reach the car, they show themselves in a provoking way and ""funny"" statement - unnecessary scene;the lady was supposed to be dead, OK she appears later again;the friend who organizes tickets, stuff and so on by receiving order via mobile, didn't they (CIA) check it like in other parts (cemetery, even camera everywhere)?the scene in the train: one bad guy was watching behind the door...like in Halloween one of the worst scenes was (also in the train), how he broke the glasses of a bad guy and also threw him out of the train...I think a bad idol for kids, who believe that Nathan is/should be the herothe end: real daddy helped suddenly, the lady appeared and became new mama of Nathan ;)my conclusion is: a movie which is not necessaryI just remember some stupid scenes and kept almost nothing, because I was not fascinated - disappointed instead",Abduction

Why do you think he is constantly topless, not because he likes to show of his muscles but because as an Alpaca he's not used to wearing T shirts it makes him rather uncomfortable. In Abduction he doesn't stray too far away from the acting he does in twilight, serious face, run a little bit, serious face, go topless, serious face, run, go topless, put shirt back on, go topless again, serious face and then finally topless. But of course all of the teenage girls and homosexual males feel all warm inside and out when they see him on screen, this means that no matter how bad his movie is he will always get the money, the box office will be rolling in money all because some people are attracted to men who like like animals. Now the movie won't disappoint the Alpaca lovers but for everyone else it is an awful movie, it currently holds a 4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and quite frankly it deserves it, I think it's time for Lautner to retire and go to a farm in the west country to live out his later years in luxury.

118,charybdis-m,I kept waiting for the werewolf to come out...,5,23 October 2011,"I had some issues with Taylor Lautner's acting here in Abduction. The movie itself was okay, but I just kept waiting for the werewolf to pop out at some point. His acting was quite good, but it's the danger with casting actors who are famous for iconic roles (just like we can't ever see Daniel Radcliffe NOT being Harry Potter, or see Robert Pattinson as something other than a vampire, or see Sarah Michelle Gellar not being Buffy, and so on and so forth). Especially with Taylor looking so much like the Jacob he plays in the Twilight Saga.About Abduction: I liked the storyline. Made me wonder what I'd think if I would ever find myself on a missing children's website. But come on, he didn't look anything like his 'parents'. Some bells must've been going off in his head! That being said, I rate Abduction a 5 out of 10. It was entertaining, but it would be more believable with someone else in the lead role. Go ahead, see for yourself!",Abduction

A fast pacing movie enjoyable after a day at work. Twilight haters are being too harsh on the reviews, Taylor appears without his shirts as often as any leading character on any action movie. Lily Collins is such a beautiful girl with a promising career, I am looking forward to see her again.

121,pioneerkaren-677-931756,Interesting Concept Defeated by Sub-Par screenplay,7,27 July 2013,"I had high hopes for this film based on the original concept and the caliber of the casting. Unfortunately, the direction of the screenplay did nothing but create implausible developments and dispassionate dialog.Many reviewers have placed sole blame for the film's shortcomings on the shoulders of Taylor Lautner, but I feel that he, and the entire cast, did the best work possible with the script available.To begin with, Lautner portrays well the average, privileged high school student with normal adolescent problems- like how to ask out the girl he likes. The film creates a strong family dynamic for Nathan and his parents, Kevin and Mara. Yet, when Nathan believes he sees his picture on a missing children website, he doesn't go to them with his questions. This begins the screenplay's failure to portray any semblance of reality. The attack that killed his parents could have occurred while Nathan was learning the truth thus sending him on the run and in search of the missing pieces of his past.The script limits Nathan on the amount of grief, indeed the amount of residual effects, he suffers over the loss of his parents. In fact, no other character ever refers to Kevin and Mara as his parents. Since they did, in fact, raise him... they should be acknowledged as his parents. In removing that emotional connection, the screenplay voids much of Nathan's attachment to them.The screenwriter relies heavily on gimmicks rather than focusing on substantial content dialog. Even the veteran actors' characters seem to be hollow with no real depth. To lay blame on the shoulders of the young star is to sell him short when he does the best he can with the script he was given. Even with its shortcomings, I still enjoyed the movie... more as a tongue-in-cheek nod to an action movie, but still enjoyable. I suggest watching it again paying close attention to dialog and content rather than putting Lautner alone under the microscope.",Abduction

This film will start Lautner's career as a multi-character star. ABDUCTON (2011) was a spectacular movie, and as a bonus, one of my all-time favorite actors Sigourney Weaver outstandingly played a minor but critical role as Dr. Bennett. ABDUCTION moved at a very fast pace, the directing and settings were riveting, and all of the cast were superbly casted in their respective roles. This emotional roller-coaster left me completely spellbound and glued to the screen, and never lost its realism or frame of reference. As an avid fan of thrillers, mysteries, and intense psychological dramas, this movie did not fail to disappoint in any respect.

127,nikkiharvey1989,I thought it was GREAT for a first time!!!!,9,4 October 2011,"First off, let me say that I have never been a fan the critics. They go in writing a movie, based off of how well they like a actor in my opinion. they will smash some of the most amazing movies, and praise some the dumbest ones known to man. This movie, is no exception. Critics despise Twilight films and anyone associated with Twilight so, it's only natural that they bash this movie. It's a good thing that these actors aren't in it for the acceptance or praise from critics. To me, the people are the real critics. OK, no this movie is not an Oscar worthy movie but it is good for it being Taylor's first movie to carry by himself. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when he beating the guy in the house that murdered his ""parents"". the emotion and intensity that he shows bc of what this man has done. not to mention he just found out not too long ago that his parents weren't his. but scenes like that and commitment like Taylor is what is going to make him an exceptional actor in the future. So, to me this movie was GREAT!!! I will certainly be getting this on DVD when it comes out and recommending it. The 9 stars are bc I don't understand how Karen(Lily Collins), got free in that one scene so it drives me mad!!! but other than that great supporting cast, and a great job for your first time Taylor!!!",Abduction
128,sweetiebeattie,It's like a bad action movie,6,8 October 2011,"It starts off like this; Nathan (Launter) riding the bonnet of his friend's car to a house party, obviously appearing very popular and OBVIOUSLY very fit, yet he still gets tongue-tied around his crush Karen (Collins). His two best friends and him are always together like they're the SITC girls; very cliché, but hey, it's a teenage thriller, good for it's genre. Then it goes down. They get partners for sociology, and surprise surprise Nathan gets Karen as a partner. She goes to his house and they start researching their topic, which is missing children, or children, or missing people; we have no idea and apparently this isn't crucial enough to add in a little line from one of them. They stumble across a website for little children that have gone missing and they find a child just like him, in a tee- shirt that he has, identical with the same stains. (Which leads to questions, why does cool guy Nathan still have a tee- shirt from when he was seven?) So then Nathan and Karen start going 'wow it's you' yada yada yada. He acts really moody around his parents without asking them, and when he does, his mum goes 'I'll go get your dad and we'll explain together'... And then she opens the door to these spies who are CIA agents or something, ohmygod we had no idea, at the end of the day all the spies looked the same. The mum, who also ends up being a spy, starts knocks out the trained assassins and it ends the house blowing up and he and Karen run away. That's basically the synopsis of the movie. Karen (for some reason decides to get involved) and Nathan run away from everyone, the good guys, the bad guys. It's awkward because- and I'm not blaming Lily Collins, but the lousy stylists and scripts- Karen tries so hard to act like the cool, popular and witty popular girl, Nathan's side-kick, but she just comes out as being the damsel he has to save, with the silly eyebrows and the pathetic everything. The online chemistry is terrible, it's so cringey for the whole audience, especially in the make-out scene. At first it's quite good, when they're kissing, but when it gets all weird and Nathan hitches her up on his hips and it's so forced. Nathan's character is so wooden, he never smiles and we don't know anything about his personality apart from he's good at boxing. Lautner really can't act- sorry. It is literally a movie full of car-chases, Lautner's abs, confusing tech hacking and good guys that are bad and bad guys that are good. It tries to keep us in suspense throughout the whole movie but it really doesn't work. There are too many loopholes- it's like a bad action manga comic. (For example, they have a pool, a motorbike, two Ferrari's, two Macs for Nathan- yet not a dishwasher? Seriously.) Should be four stars, but an extra two for, well I'm feeling bad for Lautner.

130,starfighter11,Generic CIA story with a few highlights,7,10 January 2012,"You don't expect acting from Taylor Lautner. A twen playing a 15 year- old. He majored in workout I guess, plus wrestling, as is made clear in the beginning. Lily Collins has a prettier face, and she can display emotions more effectively, but that's about it with the couple. The well-acted and fast-paced intensity of the too short appearances of Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs , and Maria Bello save the first half of the movie. The second half is large-scale intelligence warfare. The usual thriller suspense is created more or less by involving the secret service's hi-tech surveillance, which is matched by their adversary's, and some okayish shootouts. But i don't want to go into the details for the benefit of the still curious viewer. The film is fairly entertaining as a mid-level thriller. Of course it can't compete with the latest Bonds or Bournes, but you would need way more money and different protagonists to do that.

It is not terrible and is worth watching.First off, I'll start with good things about this film...Lautner is great. Because he's popular with the ladies, I think people don't notice his acting skills. He portrays a very convincing and complicated role of teenager, Nathan. Secondly, this movie is full of action. Literally, there is not a dull moment. It is moderately violent, but no major injury detail which is good if you don't like blood! The plot is complicated enough to keep you interested but not overly confusing. However. There are times when the effects and directing could have been improved. The movie has so much potential.

He gets attacked and he runs away and he finds himself running away from these people. That's it. There's so many cons to this movie and not even one pro. This movie is absolutely ridiculous from start to finish. There's no tension, the story line is terrible, it's actually not even funny, it is genuinely terrible. All this movie is a chase that's it, 2 hours of just a chase, how meaningless and boring is that. I don't know what happened here or who came up with something like this, but this is quite frankly the Worst movie I ever seen. I definitely do not recommend watching this.

This film is filled with cheesy lines and over dramatic actors. In this movie Nathan Harper (Taylor Lautner) is a regular teenage boy. He lives a normal life with his normal parents. He is most concerned with getting the girl and not getting bullied. His parents have made sure that Nathan can defend and protect himself. Little does he know that he is not the only one needing the protection. Nathan finds out that his parents, the people he has known since he was little, are not actually his parents. Nathan finds out that his adoptive parents are actually CIA secret agents. And his real father is neither good or bad. His real dad's nemesis killed his mom. And he is trying to kill him. This movie was meant to be serious but obviously failed. Even though John Singleton (director) failed to make this movie serious, he still made a good movie. When I say good movie I mean there is stupidity to a point of comedy. If you hate stupid acting and too much drama, this movie is not for you. Yes, this movie has really bad acting and directing, but those two factors were channeled towards comedy (not on purpose).

But, I will agree that it moved a little too fast in the beginning when the people in the suits came, and there was a bomb in the oven... But don't leave just because of that scene! It's never as scary as it is there...A few things bother me, like how Koslo had all this technology that could never exist in the real world (probably) And there were some times when the dialogue was lacking in something, like during Nathan's 911 call, and other times.And, sure, there are things they don't explain like the gun under the chair in the stadium, or Karyn setting herself free, but you are supposed to put two-and-two together! This is also a mystery, after all!Remember how Nathan asked Zeke is he had done ""what I asked""? I think that was putting the gun under the chair...

It makes me wonder just how much of the exaggeration and negativity is the result of envy for the young man as opposed to the movie itself. I'm glad that I decided to take a chance on the film because my family and I found it quite enjoyable and engaging (including my 83 year old father).The story was interesting with a few twists and turns that held our attention throughout the film. There were a few loopholes in the script, but not so much that they distracted from the story as a whole or caused you to get lost in the plot. I found the action sequences to be well done because Taylor did the majority of his own stunts and the shots weren't being jerked around trying to disguise a stunt double. This young man definitely has the physicality for an action movie.The young teenage actors held their own with the support of a very seasoned veteran cast. Do they still need to grow with their acting...of course they do...but they demonstrated great potential and played their teenage parts admirably. The kissing scene was a little clumsy, but then again, the characters are teenagers under stress kissing for the first time since middle school. Who wouldn't be clumsy under the circumstances?There were a few curse words, but they weren't numerous and the ""violence"" was not bloody or gory. This is not a movie filled with CGI effects. It is dependent upon the action between the characters and their environment which it does very well.Overall, the movie is a teenage action flick that even adults will find entertaining if they just sit back and enjoy without over analyzing each nuance of the film. I would recommend this movie for an evening of family entertainment when you're in the mood for an action movie without a lot of violent scenes.",Abduction

144,shhh_222,Poor Acting. Vague,3,20 December 2011,"Movie starts of with college party, actress drops of her guy and to take up our hero in 2 scenes. The sequences are very school drama type, there was no real screenplay. The Guy just shows off his body and that's it. Parents die before him, he goes back to save her love and wants to screw her even in that situation. The Guy spoiled the whole movie with his acting, he was rigid and there was no expression. HE needs to improve a lot in acting. The movie looked like it was directed by a guy straight out of school. The storyline was much worse. A guy saves some information about high officials in govt. and gets his son new identity for his safety. He keeps the data idle until the boy becomes a teenager. The teenage boy finds out he lives on a false identity and confronts his mother who is a appointed protector for him. She doesn't check on how he found out but cries like a adopted mother. The parents who brought him up are dead and he is chased by bad guys but he takes leisure time to make love to his GF. Atlast the data is handed over to correct authority, it shows as though the details was about current officials for which his wife was murdered and he keeps his son hidden until his teenage.

145,ingmark,No one is abducted?,2,23 August 2012,"Hmmmm... so the film is called abduction, I'm not sure if I missed a crucial piece of story (I was drifting to be honest), but at no point is anyone actually abducted?! The title is the least of the problems though. While I will admit that there is some decent action, the film was seriously lacking in story. I think it did actually have potential and despite the bad reviews of Taylor Lautner, I do believe him capable of something a great deal better. The fact that there are some fantastic actors present shows that a bad story coupled with bad dialogue can make any actor look terrible.It just needed a grounding in reality. Throw some real plausibility in to this and it could have been a great gritty thriller. Unfortunately it ends up in a ridiculous fantasy world... his parents might as well have turned out to really be aliens.",Abduction

Sometimes there are movies so bad that they're funny - this is not one of them. It's frustratingly bad because they're trying so hard to be serious.The writing is horrendous, but not because it's bad (which it is, very much so) but because it's a collage. Every scrap of this movie is an idea cut out from another movie, then acted out poorly. Lets go through some of the list:Contemplative while sitting at a desk scene- Check. Cute girl flirts with unattractive guy to gain access- Check. Mysterious aiding character - Check Nobody can be trusted- Check. Unfulfilled sexual attraction (with non-developed character relationship) - CheckThen you can add insane character decisions due to the unskilled writers. At one point, a character has a gun, pointed at another person holding a gun, and guess what he does? Fire the gun ? Wrong. Instead of pulling a trigger this experienced armsman decides to do a flying tackle over a counter. Good move, looks like all of that target practice paid off. Did I mention he was visibly holding the gun while tackling the 'bad guy'? Be careful, you might accidentally shoot him...Lautner may become a leading man one day, and this movie may have been good practice, but he's definitely not ready yet. This goes for both leading actors. Instead of actors trying to be characters, it's as if they are trying to be actors they've seen - play that part of the movie, in that other movie, that one time.

Taylor Lautner has the aggressive acting equivalent to that of a five-year olds tantrum in a super market when denied a junk snack from mommy. My gosh! this film was terrible! Horrendous! I cringed at every chiche and cheesy line the cast spoke on. The chemistry of the characters was even worse!

Never really got into the whole Twilight think but I have no prejudice against a movie he plays in. I watched this movie because the commercials had looked interesting enough to me. But boy was I wrong. First off this movie was very high speed. To fast in fact that I could care less for anything that happened to the main character. First he finds his picture on a false lost and found site, then explosions everything blows up literally. He watches his fake parents die before his eyes,and he only shields two tears when he wakes from a dream,after that he pretty much disowns them calling them by first name and appearing emotionless. Then a character that should have died lives some how. This was just so unrealistic and bland that even the fighting couldn't save it.

151,Alexgargiulo98,"Tries to be mind-boggling and exciting, but fails on all fronts.",3,20 October 2013,"To start this review right, I've got to tell you-- I hated this movie. Surprisingly, it wasn't Taylor Lautner that ruined it, but of course he was a part of it. Let's start by talking about Lautner. He's definitely a good stuntman, but beyond that... he's just boring. The only thing he can do is overact, or not act at all. He's either stoic and unfeeling, or crying for no reason. His character is a blank slate, that remains a black slate. Within the first 5 minutes he resorts to being shirtless.The lines aren't badly delivered, they're just bad. Cliché count: ""How do you know my name"" 3 times ""Trust has to be earned"" 2 times ""Kids.../Teenagers..."" 3 times The rest of the non-cliché dialogs is just bad, kind of like The Room, but with a larger budget. Lines like ""Can I take a shower"" or ""Your baby shirt!"" are always a laugh. The camera work is atrocious, I'd argue it's worse than the Hunger Games camera. In action scenes, the camera continuously cuts and takes shots from random angles. No shot can stay in the same spot for more than 3 seconds. It just pulls you out of the moment. When the scene is slow, the camera has to zoom in and out for no reason whatsoever. The characters, like a said, are just awful. They take no time to develop them, because they movie is too busy trying to explain its stupidly overly complex plot to a group of preteens who likely just want to see Lautner fight ninjas shirtless. The main characters share no chemistry, and everyone else acts like more of a robot than Taylor does. Many things remain unexplored, and the main characters never seem to react to the fact that their lives have been torn apart. We get to the end, and they expect us to believe that non of these characters have been changed or scarred. It's all just BS. People may say the action is good, but in reality, it isn't the movie doesn't try and does all it can to pull viewers in with nothing more than Taylor Laughter and guns.",Abduction

When soccer mom starts kicking butt I knew it was on! I know of the Twilight series but have never watched it and don't intend to.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of his but he is constantly being attacked by reviewers 'cause of his poor acting skills and his disability to wear a T-shirt. I really am sorry for the 'Team Jacob' fans out there but I really have to agree with every single one of these reviewers because unfortunately...THEY ARE RIGHT! Other than being an expert in taking his shirt off in front of camera, the guy isn't that good. Now don't get me wrong, I don't hate Lautner and I really am sorry for him...Even though I read a couple of reviews before watching this movie, I wanted to create an opinion for myself and I watched it very open minded hoping that I will be pleased with Taylor's performance but I wasn't.In my opinion the script was the major problem in this movie, it seemed to me that there wasn't much time given into this script, I mean maybe if the writer gave it a little bit more time this movie would have been...well not epic, but enjoyable.Putting the script aside, Taylor Lautner gave his normal performance which isn't that good...yet.

158,poweroftigers,Loses momentum constantly,3,28 January 2012,The main problem with this movie is the directors inability to let go of Taylor's current twilight audience and appeal to the action genre audience- this is why we are left wanting. The momentum staggers constantly in this film due to terrible editing like the girl stumbling down the bank just so Taylor can catch her. This hot chick baggage gradually and easily becomes just annoying and the movie would have been a lot better if they simply explored the main character as angry and lethal- Without the insipid bonding of the girl and hero- In an action movie the chick sometimes plays a significant role- but there is nothing significant about this girls role apart from letting teenage girls dream they were her as Taylor holds her hand constantly. Taylor needs to choose his roles more carefully in the future if he doesn't want to be typecast as a young pretty face. A fate most actors his age seem to be unable to escape.,Abduction

I found this movie very entertaining, I found it kept my attention throughout the whole film, and I enjoyed the ending.

Don't really understand why there are so many negative reviews on this movie. The movie did start out a little slow, but once it got going, it held our attention till the very end. A lot of people say this movie is a cheap made for TV thriller at best, but I disagree. Plenty of drama, plenty of action, an interesting storyline made this movie worthwhile. Granted we went to the matinée and paid $14 to see this movie, but we still thought we got our money's worth. I felt the acting was good and pretty much spot on during most the movie. Yes, there may be some resemblance to the Bourne movies, but just enjoy Abduction for what it is, a solid thriller/action flick that was a lot of fun to watch.

I get that his recent popularity Is what most people are going to see, but come on...... What 16 year old kid can take down a bunch of CIA People, oh wait, Taylor Lautner can. The story was very unrealistic. Not at all what I had hoped for. I will say that Lily Collins did a pretty good job In the film though, I expect great things out of her. But I just cant get over Taylor Lautner. If you want to go see a film that emphasize on seeing him ripped and many situations where his body is shown off, then this film may be for you.

162,dfh6,Laughably Bad,2,23 September 2011,"As a film major I have a whole list of analytical problems with this movie, but from a typical audience member's point of view, this movie was just BAD. Nothing made sense, the acting was terrible, and half the scenes were painful to watch. The ""action"" was decent at best, and the ""romance"" was a joke. The entire theater (which was quite full) was dying from laughter throughout the entire film. If you thought the trailer looked bad, the rest of the film is worse.As I mentioned, nothing seemed to make sense. The characters travel from Pittsburgh to Virginia to halfway to Nebraska then back to Pittsburgh all in about a day, but I'm not even sure if that's correct because nothing is ever made clear or explained. We see scenes begin to unravel, then suddenly they jump forward in time with no explanation. For example, Karen (Lily Collins) is tied up in a room. We see her knock a glass cup off a counter and it shatters. She starts kicking the broken glass towards her hands which are tied up around a chair leg, but then we cut back to Nathan (Taylor Lautner) who is fighting some Russian guy and suddenly she shows up in the doorway. What happened?? How did she cut herself loose?? And this isn't just a one time thing - it happens all throughout the film! Who made them lunch in the café? It was empty!! And who put the gun under his seat at the stadium?!Film flubs aside, the acting is terrible. Karen is decent, but Nathan is a joke. Even Sigourney Weaver sounds like she's reading the lines off the script. The only time we ever hear even a small dose of emotion from her is the very end of the film. Any moment that was supposed to be taken seriously was ruined by the acting and the film's attempt to be ""cool."" Most the humor was topical (Justin Bieber jokes, Facebook references) and the romance plot was pathetic. All in all this movie was BAD. The action was alright, but if you want to see an action film go watch something else. The romance was dumb. The acting was mostly awful and the story was sub-par.

There was plenty of action in this ACTION movie. The script was what one should expect from an action movie - it supports the action scenes.

Another reason why I only give it 8/10 is because of a few things that happened in the film *spoiler* such as Nathan hurting his ankle at the end then suddenly being OK *spoiler end*, but other than that the storyline was really good, actors/actresses were good as well. I also like to give films a good rating if the have a good ending. I hate watching a film for the ending to be pointless.

For example, trying to call your uncle even though people powerful enough to trace your calls are trying to get you. The purpose of such stupidity by the main characters is, of course, so the bad guys can find them, and lead the plot to its next action sequence. Also, the film failed to capture the main character's internal angst and confusion in a way that makes the audience care. Instead, he stumbles through the film with a whiny love interest with whom he has no real chemistry. I know Taylor can be charismatic and have chemistry - he pulled it off in Twilight. But it is not easy to pull it off when the script is so weak.I had really wanted to like this film, and had hoped for a youthful, energetic Bourne Identity.

With slap-me-in-the-face-with-a-sledgehammer-I-cringed-so-hard lines such as ""are we going to die?"" and the timeless ""Noooo"" screech, it is not hard to see the reason behind this films flop.This is my first film review, and yes in case you hadn't already guessed I am subject to my own first paragraph. I feel cheated that I have tore myself away from revision to bash this movie (Cough), although in some way I feel like revenge has been served. Time is money.Max",Abduction
177,TheSwedishDuck,Well that was............Awful,1,7 January 2013,"WOW what a horrible peace of sh#t. I mean take away the bad acting, the horrible dialog and the fact that Taylor Lautner has as much facial expression as a rock, And this ""movie"" might have been at least decent. But nooooo instead we get a movie that makes some of the best actors look like kids in a fifth grade play. I mean this had to be an evil plan of some sort to make Taylor Lautner look like a good actor and in this evil plan they tried to make real actors like Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver look worse then him. But it's good to now that even Alfred Molina on his worst days acts 3 times better then Taylor Lautner. So to sum it all up horrible acting, laughable dialog and a very weak story equals an awful experience.Do yourself a favor and don't watch this........... EVER!!!",Abduction
178,jillian-schroeder116,it was great!,9,13 July 2012,"i love that they stared Taylor for the role of Nathan. I don't know what people are talking about, but the acting was great! A lot of the stunts were done by Taylor himself like the first scene where Taylor is on the hood of the truck. It was very interesting and I liked how they showed how dangerous the internet can be. The movie actually shows kids that the internet isn't always fun and games, but it can be used by other people to track you and it can be very dangerous. overall i'd give it a nearly perfect mark, i found only 1 thing that i didn't like about it, and that was the kissing scene on the train. i did not like that part. It is too sudden and in-depth for the audience. The movie would have been a lot better if they would have kept that to a minimum, or better yet, taken it out all together.",Abduction
179,truehimself-471-468782,Loved it,9,13 January 2013,"Well, if are like most people, you're not going to like this movie. Obviously, I am different from most people. I had a blast. Do I have lower standards? Hell no! I find 9 out of every 10 American films too boring to watch. The only hook I that can actually make me watch a movie is superb acting or great action, preferably both. I rarely find a movie thrilling, but for me this one was all the way. I love the edge-of-your-seat drama-action type movies or shows like 24, The Event, Nikita and this was an endless thrill ride. No, there were no Oscar winning performances, but the performances given wee just fine, thank you very much. I saw many of those high budget that were rated higher than 8, including The Avengers, and enjoyed this one so much more. Story line was elaborate, unpredictable, plenty of initial mystery and the action was non stop. If you are looking for heart felt performances go elsewhere. If you want to have a 2 hour adrenaline pumping experience in a well done action flick, look no further. It totally did it for me (as a comparison I almost fell asleep at The Avengers)One more thing, some people do not enjoy fast paced sequences, or intense action and this kind of people will naturally evaluate a movie based on the acting or other things, and I don't blame them for it. Viewers who can easily get into high action, will enjoy an action/drama movie provided the acting and storyline were decent. The acting in Abduction was more than reasonable for me. Certainly, good enough for me to enjoy the entire movie. This is not Jackie Chan type acting, but a rather dramatic style acting and VERY believable in my opinion. In fact, Taylor Launter did a fine job portraying exactly the type of character he was supposed to be portraying. I really enjoyed the constant thrill which started in the first few moments and only built up much more as the movie went along.",Abduction
180,zippers94,Bourne Identity meets Twilight,4,6 November 2012,"In the movie Abduction, directed by John Singleton, Nathan Harper (Taylor Lautner) is on a quest to discover his true identity. In this action thriller there is the typical love story, villain, and a young, cute actor. This film puts Taylor Lautner in motion and is not a bad film, as long as he remains in motion. Abduction resembles the Bourne Identity movies. A young man out on the run from some other society mixed in with a love story. The credit goes to John Singleton for the great cinematography, music, and pictures. The cinematography in the action scenes are exceptional. Also, the music fits what is happening on the screen and it draws the viewers into the movie. The camera swoons this heart throbbing 19 years old boy, especially with many close ups; however, Taylor's acting is another story. Taylor Lautner is exceptional at martial arts, which helps shape his perfectly sculpted abs. This teen star was stiff, easy to read, and predictable. It seemed as if Lautner was trying a little too hard to fit into his role and just memorized and recited his lines without matching the role. I would not say this film is a successful thriller but more of a chick-flick. I would recommend this movie to any teenage girl that wants someone good to look at, but not for anyone that would want watch a good action/ thriller.",Abduction
181,kwdzr3,Enjoyable film for what it is,8,5 June 2013,"I'll start off by saying that this is my first review for a movie, and that I actually created an account on this website just to comment on it. Was the movie so amazingly mind-blowing that I needed to tell the world about it? No, but most of the reviews are very misleading and all of the hate coming down on Lautner is just ridiculous. All the reviews about how the movie is just about his abs, its ABSolutely about taylor lautner etc. are obviously coming from a bunch of fatties because guess what, LAUTNER Doesn't TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF AT ANY POINT DURING THE WHOLE F*** MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! OK there is 1 scene like 5 minutes in where he wakes up completely smashed from the night before with just his pants on, but that's it. He got super drunk and lost his shirt, then he's in a scene for 10 seconds helping clean up the party with no shirt on. Big f*** deal, get of the couch you fatasses! What about the scene where he crawls out of the freezing river with the hot girl and they're both soaking wet shivering, that would've been a perfect opportunity to lose the clothes and prounce around in his underwear if he really wanted to, but no they just go to sleep in their wet clothes (lol). I couldn't believe people are making MULTIPLE hater reviews about how the movie solely focuses on his abs... ridiculous.As for the movie itself, I think it was a very enjoyable action flic and it was very believable at times (Lautner actually hurts his hand punching someone's face, actually hurts his leg coming down off a big jump -- something you'd never see tommmy cruzcruz admit to), the acting was very solid in my opinion from lead and support, and it was simply realistic FOR THE MOST PART. No crazy scenes where there's a 1 handed head shot from 50 yds away while flying through the air or getting rushed by 40 bad guys yet they all decide to attack you one at a time. Once scene I didn't like was when a good guy is creeping up on a bad guy and they both have guns, the good guy gets the jump on him but instead of shooting he decides to do a flying tackle... what? Oh well, I guess he just needed to die for the plot.The story was jumpy at times, kind of skipped around a bit and Lautner makes some stupid tactical decisions at times but looking back I'd say it's to be expected as a kid being thrown into a crazy situation like that. I very much enjoyed the fact that I EXPECTED it to be stupid over the top action combined with Lautner butchering every scene with desperation for attention, but instead it was pretty solid, realistic action.I only have 2 negative remarks - Lautner needs to work on some different facial expressions, and the story could've used a bit more twists or emotion or something; I felt like it should've been a bit more suspenseful and gut-clenching considering the storyline. OK, so maybe that is a result of bad acting. So Lautner needs to work on his emotional delivery. At least he kept his shirt on.In reality more like a 6/10, but it gets an 8 because I expected it to be a 4 and most people gave it a 2.",Abduction
182,Dina-Arobi-Films,Awful and Incompetent,1,21 June 2014,"Hands-down one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Nothing about this movie is good. All of its aspects fail to provide a good quality movie. A movie done without passion and with a lack and/or waste of talents. John Singleton might still be the youngest Best Director Oscar nominee ever, but his work on this film proves that this is far far behind us.A lot of the movie doesn't make any sense (Nathan really never noticed he didn't had any picture of him as a baby? He still has that small t- shirt, with the mark still on it? How does his friend conveniently provides him with IDs and tickets? Where is the 'abduction'? ), and a lot of it is also so bad its hilarious, like ""lets get some food!"" while we are kissing passionately, or ""I'll kill all your people, including your teachers, you will have no more friends on Facebook!"", and would you really smile at how good the car looks while there are people out there trying to kill you? The directing is bad, the writing is terrible, the acting ranges from awful to forgettable, the score is unoriginal, some of the cinematography is questionable, and the worst thing about this movie is the editing. Seriously, this has to be the worst editing I've ever seen (1 second long shots in a conversation scene?).Anyway, I didn't had any expectations out of an action-thriller starring Taylor Lautner, but I didn't expect such an impressive level of awfulness from start to finish. Avoid it at all cost.",Abduction
183,nortonvicky,It's not that bad!,7,15 November 2014,"I can't understand why everyone's so down on this movie. In fact I'm giving it an extra star because I feel sorry for it. For heaven's sake, what were you expecting, Shakespeare? It's a teen movie! I know there are better teen movies for adults out there, but if you're just looking for a little action, a little entertainment, a couple of cute leads, and a little bit of angst and peril, this is your movie. I also don't know why everyone's giving Taylor Lautner such a hard time—it's a movie where he finds out his parents aren't his parents right before they're killed in front of him. He acts perfectly believably in this situation. Not sure what people are expecting. And why are you looking for a fabulous script when the show is about TEENAGERS, who aren't known for their wit and snappy dialogue? Yes, there are cringeworthy lines and clichés, and the ending resolution, as far as his family situation, is a bit weird, but again, I'm not waiting for a Sherlock-level script here. Plus the problem people have with Taylor being 'shirtless' within five minutes. He's passed out on the floor, guys, not standing around flexing. Just chill the hell out, make some popcorn, and enjoy some mindless action and eye candy.",Abduction
184,katelouiseward,A Teen Dream- Not For Avid Action Fans,5,28 February 2015,"In Taylor Lautner's breakout role from the 'Twilight' saga, this film did possess some potential to showcase his range, depth and quality as an actor. However, one of the only things it appeared he did showcase was his bare chest. Not that I'm complaining. To be fair to Lautner, who played the film's protagonist Nathan, the script was extremely limited and I felt that the action scenes he was involved in built up tension and added some much needed spice to an otherwise dry and predictable wordplay. I did warm to Nathan's character, although there was rarely any character development as the story centred around him finding his picture on a missing child website and the action-packed aftermath of the revelation.The unnecessary love story between Nathan and Karen, the girl next door who he had secretly been crushing on, is rushed and although the two actors have great chemistry, the relationship seems to stem from nowhere and Karen's character is about as intriguing and useful as a wet floor mop. Acting by supporting roles such as Isaacs, Molina and Weaver were also adequate in fulfilling their purpose but again, lack of character development does not allow for a great understanding.Undoubtedly the film did have potential and some really interesting moments, however the in some places flat plot and diabolical script writing left me feeling confused, and wishing that Lautner could land a role allowing him to break free from the brooding teenage love interest that he seemingly escaped from in his previous films. I do think critics have been harsh on 'Abduction', after all it is rated PG 13, I mean were they expecting 'The Matrix'?Overall the action scenes were the saviour of the entire film for me, as I found myself gripped particularly in the end scene at the baseball game. The fact that Lautner performs most stunts himself adds authenticity and again, allows the female viewers some entertainment. I would say this film definitely appeals to the teenage target audience,and if you're just looking for some serious thrills and spills, disregarding the storyline itself, the movie is perfectly enjoyable. However,if you were anticipating a riveting action film with a fully engaging plot, you will most likely be disappointed.",Abduction

186,khorton-33806,A great film with plenty of gore!,7,14 November 2016,"If you're into sporting movies with a mix of racy scenes of violence then this is type of movie for you. On the other hand if you're not too keen on the sight of blood then you need to choose something with a rating below a 12. The love story between the two main characters is heart throbbing with a mixture of weird cringe scenes. The music throughout the movie is very current to the latest in hip hop, there are links of music from the old Rocky films. I would say there is a tiny amount of gore the main graphic parts are swelling to Adonis's face and blood. We would rate this movie a credulous 7 out of 10.I would definitely encourage you to watch this!",Abduction
187,Celesta8,"I paid more for a sneak preview movie that was barely mediocre, had plenty of loopholes and raw acting, but at least there's Taylor Lautner",4,23 September 2011,"I managed to convince my friends to watch this movie because I told them the trailer was killer. But, boy was I proved wrong. The movie was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENTSneak preview tickets are more expensive than normal movies. But I thought it was gonna be good so I paid for it. Only to end up watching a very bland, non-climactic movie with a very poorly written storyline. The only highlight of the show was seeing Taylor Lautner acting as a normal high school kid instead of a werewolf. But still, sad to say his acting had no charisma at all. His co-actress Lily Collins was no better, or maybe it was just her character that was so unlikeable, it made the whole movie really draggy. First quarter of the movie was still fine, but then it started to get cheesy.... There were so many loopholes in the movie and it just feels like the script and plot were very poorly planned. I sense sloppy work there. I left the theatre feeling so bewildered. So you might say:""it's just a movie.... not everything makes sense"" But comparing to big action-spy movie names like Bourne, Mission Impossible and Die Hard which have delivered an excellent movie experiences which leaves you at the edge of your seat, Abduction feels more like a chick-flick packed with more action, or maybe a budget action film. It's very subtle.The parts I enjoyed in the movie was the presence of veterans like Sigourney Weaver, Mario Bello and my favourite, Jason Isaacs who plays Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. They are always a joy to have and see in movies. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Unless you just want to see Taylor Lautner, I would rather you give this show a miss. If you really want to go for it, don't get your hopes too high.",Abduction
