0,Leofwine_draca,"Surreal, one of a kind, visual feast",7,26 December 2015,"This is a weird movie. The best thing you can say about it is that it's fairly original, especially the scenes taking place inside dream landscapes. Such moments in film are hard to capture but I found them well realised here, and pretty believable. The structure of the film is rather predictable, and there's a gritty vibe running through it the same as in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Detectives, including a surprisingly decent Vince Vaughn, are on the trail of a supremely sick serial killer, played to the hilt by a highly disturbing Vincent D'Onofrio. This guy has a fetish for kidnapping and trapping women in glass tanks that slowly fill with water, drowning them.Eventually, the guy is caught, only to go into a coma. Thanks to a sci-fi element, scientists are able to enter the man's consciousness and now they need to find out where a girl is hiddenand the film runs with that premise. For a start, the imagination here is way out. The serial killer's mind is full of sickening imagery, and there's a central torture sequence that turned my stomach. Strong sauce indeed. Then there's a cast who actually do the material justice – including Dylan Baker's twitchy scientist, Jake Weber's serious fed and best of all Jennifer Lopez, as the smart, sassy and fearless heroine.The film is suspenseful and twisted, as thrillers should be, and it kept me gripped until the very end. Looking back, I see it as one of the most atypical Hollywood films out there – and it benefits from this status. Recommended.",The Cell
1,SnoopyStyle,Another serial killer movie with unique killer visuals,9,17 November 2013,"Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a psychologist who uses an experimental treatment that literally goes into the dreams of her patients. Captured serial killer Carl Rudolph Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and FBI Agent Novak (Vince Vaughn) convinces Deane to go into his mind to find his last victim before she's killed in an automatic water chamber.Director Tarsem Singh uses the well worn serial killer movie to add an amazing visual depiction of the dreamworld. The serial killing is dark and creepy like 'Se7en'. It's been done before, but the dreamscape visuals are a completely different story. It is stunningly beautiful and disturbing, an artistic view on dreamscapes. The style is unlike anything I've seen before. For that, I must give it full marks.",The Cell
2,lee_eisenberg,"how to ""cell"" an idea",6,29 April 2006,"Sort of expanding on ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Cell"" portrays a woman (Jennifer Lopez) entering a comatose killer's (Vincent D'Onofrio) mind so that he can help her find his latest victim. I guess that this movie is really all about the visuals as she drifts through his subconscious. If the movie has any problem, it's the casting of Jennifer Lopez. She actually does a good job here, but given that she's only starred in idiotic movies since, it's almost hard to take her seriously (and at times, it seems like they're just trying to show off her underwear). Fortunately, D'Onofrio makes a really creepy killer, and Vince Vaughn is also passable as Lopez's cohort.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie above all others. It's more of a way to pass time. Still, it is a pretty original idea with some impressive scenes. Also starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste.",The Cell
3,jboothmillard,The Cell,5,11 July 2005,"When I heard about this I thought it might be quite good, how wrong I was. It isn't rubbish, I just don't know if I want to see it again. The main reason I wanted to see it was because it mentioned sexual references. Also, it had the wonderfully shaped Jennifer Lopez in it. But of course, it didn't have any sex or nudity at all, apart from some woman in a tank. Basically this is only good because some people are doing illegal experiments on people in a tank in The Cell. Lopez is obviously the woman that tries to stop it with the help of the government. There are some moments where she is attractive in a bikini, but that's as far as she will go. Dodgeball's Vince Vaughn as FBI Agent Peter Novak, Full Metal Jacket's Vincent D'Onofrio as Carl Rudolph Stargher, Dawn of the Dead's Jake Weber as FBI Special Agent Gordon Ramsey, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Henry West and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Dr. Miriam Kent. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Worth watching!",The Cell
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Fantastic Visuals But Very Sordid, Unpleasant Story",5,12 December 2006,"This film has some of the wildest visuals I'd seen up to the time of my first viewing of this in April of 2001. The visuals were easily the highlight of the film. It isn't the story because that's too much on the sordid side. Sometimes, it's just plain too uncomfortable.It's another demented serial killer story, this one as sick an individual as I've seen, although, thankfully, there are not a lot of scenes with him. The switch is that he is captured early on but is in a catatonic-like state and unable to talk. His latest victim must be found quickly or she will die as the others did. The only way to find where this woman is stashed is by going inside his brain and try to solve the puzzle. That's Jennifer Lopez's role here as ""Catherine Deane."" When she enters, the visuals are perhaps like someone on LSD, and they are very interesting, along with good sound effects. It's a bizarre story that keeps your attention, although gruesome at times. I haven't seen this film since 2002 and since then became a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio's detective character in Law and Order: Criminal Intent. I'm not sure I want to go back and see him as this sick killer now that I am used to seeing him as a ""good guy."" However, I am curious about that.The bad points of the film, to me, were (1) a definite anti-Christian cheap shot in which it is shown that the killer was first ""tortured"" when he was baptized through immersion and held too long under water by his sadistic father. In addition to the obvious bias, it also shows you how theologically ignorant Hollywood is, thinking the parent does the baptizing. Wrong. Anway, in conjunction with that, the killer is shown ore as a young boy than any other period and then is seen to be a sympathetic figure! Only with Liberals, is there sympathy for the sadistic killer more than his victims!! At least there is one cop in here who states that a horrible childhood doesn't have to turn someone into a sick killer.So th question for me wound up being: are the visuals worth putting up with the unpleasant story. The answer wound up being ""no.""",The Cell
5,BA_Harrison,Girlfriend in a coma.,7,23 June 2009,"Silence Of The Lambs meets Dreamscape in this slick, sick sci-fi/horror which stars J-Lo as Catherine Deane, a psychologist who enters the mind of comatose serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) in an attempt to discover the whereabouts of his latest victim, Anne Marie Vicksey, who is trapped in a glass room that is slowly filling with water.When Catherine runs into trouble whilst inside Stargher's twisted subconscious world, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) plunges himself into the nightmare in an attempt to save her.As far as dazzling eye candy is concerned, The Cell is a real winner: packed with arresting cinematography, surrealist effects, striking set design, and incredibly creative costumes, the film is simply stunning to look at and, for this reason alone, is well worth checking out. It's a shame, however, that The Cell's intriguing storyline isn't quite as polished as the visuals.Certain aspects of the story are handled extremely well, such as the abduction and plight of Anne Marie and Stargher's perverted treatment of his victims' bodies, but other areas of the plot make little sense or feel under-developed: Catherine saving Stargher's inner child seems ultimately rather pointless (he's a serial killer; he dies; so who cares); Novak hints at a troubled childhood, but we never learn what it is that happened to him; and the FBI agent's realisation that he knows how to locate Ann-Marie is way too sudden.As far as the performances go, Lopez and Vaughn are adequate, but it is D'Onofrio who steals the show, both as the 'real-life' lank-haired killer (who gets his kicks by suspending himself above his victims' bleached corpses and having a quick hand shandy whilst watching them die on video), and his wicked dream persona—a decadent, sniggering demi-god in a freaky world of his own making.",The Cell
6,Quinoa1984,This is very good,9,18 August 2000,"I think this film might be one of the best of the year for me (if not, better films of the year which is 10-20 on my list) by showcasing some astounding visuals, a exceptional story and well thought out characters. 
Directed by Tarsem Singh (of R.E.M. music video Losing my Religion fame), he brings great visual and original quality to this picture that nowadays are being seen by quite a few music video/comercial directors turned film (Spike Jonze's Being John Malkvoich, David Fichner's Fight Club, David O. Russel's Three Kings, etc.).  And I think that shows that people who have experience directing off screen and then come into film, disrupt the film industry, in a good way.Tarsem has Jennifer Lopez back on the screen after a year absence (she was musical last year) playing a psychologist of the mind, who is hired by FBI to go inside the mind of a killer (Vincent D'Onofrio is a terrifying performance) who is the only one who knows where his last victim might be. One might compare the visuals to 2001, which are similar.  And another might compare the story to Silence of the Lambs, which has many similarities.  One being that this time, D'Onofrio's mind gives the clues the Lopez like how in Lambs Hopkins gave the clues to Foster.  One key thing also is that this film has fantastic visuals and a exceptional story to back it up.  That is how The Matrix last year got to be so good, and how Hollow Man (which had a horrible story) 2 weeks ago was a waste.  Definately a good film, but expect violence and gore more terrifying than the whole third act of Dawn of the Dead.  A+",The Cell
7,sunwarrior13,It Offers Nothing New,8,26 September 2012,"The Cell is a science fiction psychological thriller film starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio. The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vince.It was directed by Tarsem Singh.Child psychiatrist Catherine Deane has developed a technique that allows her to travel through the minds of her patients. When Stargher, a multiple murderer who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped.If she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter.If you're looking for emotional depth, substantial plot, and artistic coherence, this movie is sure to disappoint.It offers a disturbing, stunning eye candy, but it is undermined by a weak and shallow plot line that offers nothing new.It does not hold a candle to the same movie mind-trips genres such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Altered States and What Dreams May Come.",The Cell

9,hitchcockthelegend,Interesting but muddled affair.,6,4 March 2008,"A revolutionary breakthrough in psychotherapy enables therapist Catharine Deane to go into the minds of patients to get to the root cause of the problems. After the police track down serial killer Carl Stargher, they find he has fell into a coma, this is bad news as his last victim is holed up in a cell that fills with water at frequent intervals, she's still alive but only Stargher knows where she is......The Cell to me was working just fine as a standard serial killer maniac on the loose film, we are introduced to the maniac early on {Vincent D'Onofrio on disturbed form}, and we get repulsed to the point that we are in no doubt that this is a troubled mind. The film then shifts from basic formula to one of pure fantasy, and as beautiful as some of the sequences and images are, the film goes dangerously over the top to create style over substance.It's an above average multi genre piece, but the acting is less than great, which in truth evens the films novelty value out. It's certainly worth that once only viewing, but thinking hard about it afterwards will only frustrate you because you realise they got carried away with the gimmick, 6/10.",The Cell
10,Theo Robertson,Visually Striking And Disturbing Virtual Reality Thriller,7,16 January 2010,"A serial killer , Carl Stargher , has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell . He is apprehended by the FBI , but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water Take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it . The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher then sets up a different film entirely This wouldn;'t be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesn't let it end there , things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . We see a third character , a FBI man enter Stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing momentsIt should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable , then involving . One scene where a FBI agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button . You'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one",The Cell
11,LeonLouisRicci,Beautifully DisturbingEdgy and Stunning Serial Killer Art Film,8,29 May 2015,"A Film with the Premise of Probing the Mind of a Very Violent, Sadistic, and Highly Disturbed Serial Killer is, If Done Right, Bound to Be Very Violent, Sadistic, and Highly Disturbing. Indian Director Singh Certainly Got It Right.The Film Left Some Viewers Disgusted and Nauseated. Maybe that's Because the Behavior of the Serial Killer is Disgusting and Nauseating. What Makes the Film Special is the Way it's Framed with an Artsy, Beautiful Template that Completely Goes Against the Aforementioned. It is Contrast Taken to a Level of Disassociation.It's a Disturbing and Haunting Film. The Images on Screen Could be the Most Artistic and Gut-Wrenching of Any Modern Horror Movie. The Combination of Police Procedure, Psychological Interface, and Outrageous Criminal Behavior was Something New in the Year 2000. But, it Might Remind One of a Movie Made More than 80 Years Previously. ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1917).Jennifer Lopez is Perfect in the Role of a Medical Sensitive and Vince Vaughn Delivers a Thankfully Restrained Detective. Vincent D'Onofrio is Outlandishly Outstanding as the Antagonist.Overall, it is a Strange Film that is Definitely Not for Everyone. But will Most Likely be Embraced by Art Film and Horror Movie Fans. It has Images that are Likely to Linger and Although Some are Stunning in Their Surreal Beauty, Others are a Blood-Bath Not So Easy to Forget, Unsettling and Psychically Intrusive.",The Cell
12,poolandrews,Visually striking but thematically empty serial killer thriller.,5,3 August 2009,"The Cell starts as serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) kidnaps Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff) who he intends to be his next victim, Stargher takes Julia to an isolated underground bunker & imprisons her in a large glass tank which will start to fill with water & eventually drown her. However FBI agents lead by agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) are close to catching Stargher & raid his house only to find Stargher comatose on the floor after having some sort of seizure. The doctors say Stargher will never regain consciousness & that his latest victim Julia is doomed to die. Then they decide to use an new technology that allows one person to enter the mind of another using computers, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is given the job of entering the mind of a serial killer & finding out where he has hidden Julia in order to save her life. It isn't pretty inside Stargher's mind & with time running out the pressure is on to find the answers...This American German co-production was the feature film directorial debut of Tarsem Singh & while one cannot deny The Cell is a striking visual experience it's less impressive on other counts. If we forget about the lush & extravagant visuals for a moment there's not that much of a film here to be honest, the serial killer angle is laid bare within the opening sequence & as such there are no twists or surprises in that regard. We know Stargher is the killer from the get-go & the film plays to expectations in this aspect. The character's are fairly poor, the ever awful Jennifer Lopez's character in particular has no sort of story at all, we never find anything out about her & apart from walking around some fancy sets wearing some bizarre clothes she doesn't really have anything to do. Other character are similarly short changed in the development stakes. At about 100 odd minutes the pace is alright but I did like the film better while it was a straight serial killer thriller & I sort of lost interest once Lopez went into Stargher's mind with some surreal & bizarre moments that aren't exactly bad but I didn't really know what to make of them. The actually process in which Lopez enters Stargher's mind is never really explained & it looks more like virtual reality than a computer programme with those suits that they wear. I didn't hate The Cell but I didn't love it either, it looks fantastic but it's also rather shallow & somewhat empty on the inside.As already mentioned by just about everyone else who has ever seen The Cell some of the visuals are stunning from the sets to the special effects & the costumes which are lavish, extravagant & a joy to see. The Cell is a great looking, very arty & frankly gorgeously photographed film. The camera is free flowing, it travels everywhere from high shots to wide shots to tracking shots there's always something to look at & appreciate in The Cell but is that enough? Not really. There's a bit of nastiness with D'Onofrio hanging himself from the ceiling by metal hooks & masturbating over his dead victim & there's also an unpleasant scene in which someones guts are pulled out of their body on a spit roast thing. While it looks great & it's inspiration lies in surreal paintings & other works it's not scary & there's surprisingly little tension as it's fairly predictable with no real twists or surprises.With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 The Cell looks great & has lavish production values & decent CGI effects, filmed in California & Namibia. The acting is OK, I personally hate Jennifer Lopez as I don't think she can act, I don't think shes that good looking & she definitely can't sing so whats the point of her existence?The Cell is a visually striking serial killer thriller that is very easy on the eye & features some truly memorable imagery but it doesn't really cut the mustard on any other count. Followed by a DTV sequel The Cell 2 (2009) which by all accounts is awful.",The Cell
13,lastliberal,Took too long to get anywhere,6,20 April 2007,"I won't lie. I wasted this because of Jennifer Lopez. It was before i knew to despise Vince Vaughn, and I had not started to appreciate Vincent D'Onofrio, so it was just JLo that I was here to see. Of course, she was great, and her makeup and costumes were fantastic. Other than that, I wasn't much impressed with what I saw. I don't like special effects just for the sake of special effects.Now, if you are into Rodriguez/Tarantino violence and blood, then there is some stuff here that you will find to your liking. I won't spoil it and tell you what they do to the women, children and dogs. Nasty stuff.But is really didn't have a credible plot (what science fiction does?) so it just dragged along until the ending.",The Cell
14,zardoz-13,A Flawed But Unforgettable Fantasy That Might Keep You Wired,4,31 May 2008,"After years of toiling in the commercial as well as music video industry, helming videos like R.E.M.'s ""Losing My Religion"" or ads for Nike, director Tarsem Singh makes a memorable cinematic debut with this chilling, atmospheric hybrid of ""Silence of the Lambs"" meets ""The Matrix."" Actually, several other films such as ""Fantastic Voyage,"" ""Altered States,"" ""Dreamscape,"" ""Se7en,"" and Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""Spellbound"" come to mind that resemble Singh's psychiatry-themed parable ""The Cell"" with Jennifer Lopez. Hopefully, Singh will learn from the many mistakes that he made in this vile but visually resplendent mishmash.Slipshod scripting, an anti-climactic reversal of roles, and a passive villain undermine this otherwise picturesque nail-biter about a nervy child therapist who tours the mind of a comatose serial killer so that the FBI can uncover clues about the fiend's last victim before the victim drowns in 48 hours. Bizarre visual imagery enhances this far-fetched tale but doesn't compensate for freshman scenarist Mark Protosevich's muddled but melodramatic yarn about the evil that men do and the redemption they seek for such acts. Moreover, ""The Cell"" depicts women as vulnerable victims that can only be brutalized or saved by strong, resourceful men. The underlying message in ""The Cell"" is that any man, however inexperienced he may be, can do a job better than a woman whose expertise lies in that field.Sexy Jennifer Lopez of ""Out of Sight"" stars as Catherine Dean, a pot-smoking psychologist who uses breakthrough virtual reality brain wave technology to explore the troubled minds of her patients. During the opening sequence of ""The Cell,"" Catherine appears like a princess bride in a flowing wedding dress with white-feathers. She is riding a dark horse across a surrealistic African desert. Dismounting from the steed, which turns into a Dali-like statue, she crosses a sprawling sand dune and saunters toward a small child, Edward Baines (Colton James), standing alone by a huge dead tree. Actually, neither Catherine nor the child is in the desert. She is treating this catatonic child with a transcendental form of mind therapy called neurological synaptic-transfer that allows her to probe his mind as if it were a landscape and converse with him as if he were conscious. In reality, not only are Catherine and Edward both outfitted in skin-tight, corduroy-style suits, but they are also hanging by wires so that they appear to be hovering motionlessly in the air like the corpses in director Michael Crichton's 1978 medical thriller ""Coma."" No matter how hard Catherine tries, she has not been able to bring the child out of his coma and feels as frustrated by her fruitless forays as the boy's dejected parents.Vince Vaughn of ""Psycho"" co-stars as tenacious FBI agent Peter Novak. He is a rough-hewn ""Dirty Harry"" style cop who once prosecuted criminals before he got so fed up with the way that the legal system coddled felons that he joined the Feds instead to catch them. Novak has just nabbed a creepy serial slayer, Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio of ""Full Metal Jacket""), who abducts beautiful women, drowns them, bleaches them white, and uses them to satisfy his ghastly necrophiliac urges.Unfortunately, the FBI caught Stargher moments after he suffered a seizure that plunged him into a coma that doctors diagnose as irreversible. This constitutes another flaw in ""The Cell."" The villain is out for the count, and anything that Stargher does in his perverted mind can be counteracted by Catherine. She has a chicken switch microchip embedded in her hand that that she can activate when things get too hairy for her. The problem here too is that nothing that occurs when Catherine visits the minds of either Edward or Stargher is real. Nevertheless, while she is inside their minds, she believes that she is in an actual place dealing with actual people.Desperate to liberate Stargher's last victim (Tara Subkoff) before a clock mechanism floods an inescapable underground chamber with her trapped in it, agent Novak appeals to Dean and her experimental, high-tech, neurological team. Our stalwart heroine agrees after some initial misgivings, but she discovers that Carl is as dangerous comatose as when he is fully conscious. In Stargher's warped mind, Catherine encounters both Carl as an adult and as a young, innocent child (Jake Thomas) and struggles to ferret out clues to the girl's whereabouts. Eventually, she gets lost in Stargher's Gothic dungeon of a mind. Meanwhile, like the cavalry charging to the rescue, Novak enters Stargher's mind through the dubious synaptic-transfer device so that he can both free Catherine and find the victim. Tarsem and Protosevich treat their sadomasochistic fiend with surprising sympathetic. Evidently, Stargher became a demented monster because his mother abandoned him and his father abused him. The scenes of the evil father whipping his whimpering son with a belt for playing with dolls because the father isn't about to raise a son with what he defines as homosexual tendencies is heavy stuff. Fundamentalist religious groups won't it that Carl's woes began with an old-fashioned river baptism. Protosevich's provocative but unsavory script may repel some people, especially when the serial slayer suspends himself from the ceiling by rings embedded in his back so that he can achieve a weightless feeling before he has intercourse with his eviscerated victims.Sadly, despite its suspenseful finale to save Stargher's last victim, ""The Cell"" collapses long before Novak discovers the damsel-in-distress' location. The filmmakers never explain how the brain wave technology works so credibility lies entirely in the eye of the beholder. While it is possible to overlook this obvious shortcoming because the elaborate virtual reality mind procedure doesn't exist, an even greater flaw both in a dramatic as well as sexual sense which cannot be easily ignored occurs when Catherine cannot complete the task that the FBI assigned her while a less experienced FBI agent performs her job for her! Not only is this anti-climactic, but it also conveys as stereotypical image of women as the weaker sex.",The Cell
15,Boba_Fett1138,Creativly original.,7,1 January 2006,"This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make ""The Cell"" a memorable and above average movie.""The Cell"" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. The movie has some perfectly 'dreamy' sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical Hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. Because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn't fit the role well enough and no, I'm not saying that because I'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.The musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of ""Se7en"" like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.It's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still ""The Cell"" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Cell

It was good enough to hold my attention and get me to wince a little, but that was only due to the special effects. The story was O.K., it reminded me a lot of Dreamscape. Catherine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) is the main character. She plays a psychiatrist that is able to enter the mind of her patients via some secret drug and electronics. Things start getting hectic when she enters the mind of a psychotic killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'onofrio) in order to find out where he has hidden his latest victim.There were plenty of interesting scenes from a cinematic perspective, but the dialogue and story itself did little to make this movie very good. The idea of going into another realm to accomplish something in reality is nothing new even if it is going into someone's mind.

17,Uriah43,Good Special Effects,6,19 April 2015,"""Catherine Deane"" (Jennifer Lopez) is a social worker who has chosen to pursue a unique method of therapy in which she is psychically transported into the mind of a patient while they are dreaming. In one particular case she has volunteered to help a young boy by the name of ""Edward Baines"" (Colton James) who has entered into a coma due to a traumatic experience of some kind and her intention is to get him to talk about it to her in order to help facilitate the healing process. It's at this time that she is apprised of a situation involving a serial killer named ""Carl Stargher"" (Vincent D'Onofrio) who, prior to slipping into a coma, has kidnapped a woman who will certainly die if the authorities cannot find her in time. Realizing that time is of the essence she agrees to go into his mind fully aware that the risks involved in this procedure are seriously elevated due to the mental state of the subject. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that the film itself had some good things going for it. The overall plot was interesting and the special effects were quite good. On the other hand the acting was slightly uneven at times and some of the scenes towards the end could have used some improvement. But in general this was an entertaining movie for the most part and I rate it as slightly above average.",The Cell

Jennifer Lopez hooks to cables and put to sleep where she will interlock within the mind of her subject. When a murderer is found unconscious in his home Lopez must interlock with his mind to find an abducted woman. There is a number of disgusting images but it is a triumph in art direction and visual effects. Interesting plot that borrows from The Silence of the Lambs, The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor yet it still maintains an interesting analysis of who we are within our own thoughts. Inventive directing by Tarsem Singn with Lopez is strong as the heroine who puts herself on the line for the sake of this mindless project of the brain. Vince Vaughn is the typical cop whose purpose is to be a potential romantic fling to Lopez. Best performance is from Vincent D'Onofrio as the derange villain who treats his victims like dolls. Once his body is found it is up to Lopez to unlock his mind and find answers. Other roles are cardboard and no where near as interesting as the premise deserves.

Once we enter the mind of the killer, the film really takes a turn for the better, and becomes very unnerving.Singh knows how to use colours to a psychedelic effect, and the use of shadow and light would make Caligari envious.Lopez is okay in her role, but beauty outweighs her performance as she whispers all her lines for no reason. Vaughn is good, but the film belongs to D'onofrio, he is fantastic as the killer and really makes the whole thing work.The film loses it's pace a little at the end, but it would have been really hard to live up to the second act.well worth seeing, even if you don't like the serial killer sub-genre, it's beautiful to look at.",The Cell

Although the plot seems convoluted, the film is actually easy to follow and it's a veritable feast for the eyes.The best 'feast' is Jennifer in her prime. Also on the female front is Catherine Sutherland as one of the victims. The only thing that takes down my rating is the early scene showing how the sick phukk gets his jollies with female corpses.

How about just hinting at it or describing it verbally?The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot mostly in Southern Cal, e.g. San Diego (neurosciences facility), Los Angeles (hospital), Bakersfield (the silos), Taft & Pomona; as well as the Namib Desert (mind scenes with the boy).GRADE: B.",The Cell

26,Red-Barracuda,Together in dreams...,9,7 August 2012,"In this sci-fi thriller a child psychiatrist is experimenting with a new technology that allows for one person to enter another's mind. Meanwhile, the FBI catches a serial killer who has fallen into a coma. The psychiatrist is tasked with entering his mind in order to find the whereabouts of a girl he has captured and left in a deadly torture cell.This is essentially a serial killer film with a very original angle. The science fiction element is really there purely as a means to allow us to enter the subconscious dream world of the killer. It's here where the movie departs from other films of the same genre. It's also here where The Cell truly marks itself out as a memorable movie. The story isn't all that strong but the look and feel of the dream-world is where this one scores. Visually, it's extremely good, with an especially well-used widescreen frame, and beautiful use of colour. The subconscious worlds are by turns surreal, beautiful and creepy. It is without a doubt the fantastic cinematography, set-design, costumes and lighting that are the strengths of this film.As a means of trying to discover the whereabouts of the trapped girl, the psychiatrist tries to make a connection with the killer. In doing so she realises that he has a good and bad side. The good being his younger self before he became twisted as a result of abuse. It's an unusual angle to attempt to empathise with a serial murderer. Usually audiences are never asked to and I suppose it's an interesting difference. However, it's not an idea that 100% works though as no matter the childhood traumas it's quite difficult sympathising with a man who abducts, tortures and kills young women. This aside though, The Cell remains a highly stylish thriller, whose visual brilliance alone is enough reason for it to be considered a triumph.",The Cell

28,KineticSeoul,It's all about the imageries,6,11 January 2017,"For a movie such as this, it's all about the imageries. The images here are very nightmarish, horrifying and creative. However it's a movie that tries to be artistic but lack true artistic elements. So the plot is about diving into the mind of a mentally disturbed culprit by using a machine that allows people to dive into the mind of a patient. It sort of reminded me of the Animus machine from Assassin's Creed. Anyways the process is to find the location of the killers latest victim. So you as an audience witnesses what is going down within the mind of a serial killer. And the demons and abusive past the killer dealt with in the past. However the drawbacks to this film is how it doesn't really delve into connecting the imagery to the story. What I mean is, you just don't get how some crazy images in this connects with why the killer is the way he is. Which in a way makes the journey lack substance and can become pretentious from time to time. However the crazy, bizarre and yet stunning imageries made this movie a somewhat worthwhile watch.

29,sddavis63,Bizarre!,6,21 July 2001,"Bizarre is the only word that can describe this movie. That isn't to say that it was bad. The point, I'm sure, is that descending into the mind of a serial killer would be expected to be bizarre. So, in that respect because the movie is bizarre, it's to be admired as a success.The action is set in the context of a race against time. The killer (played by Vince D'Onofrio) had kidnapped one last victim, but then due to illness was found lapsed into a coma. The police have to find the victim before she dies in a contraption set up to drown her in 40 hours (just as an aside, I have to confess that this kind of reminded me of the old ""Batman"" TV series; I always used to wonder why the Joker didn't just shoot Batman instead of trying to turn him into a giant milkshake or whatever. But I digress.) Their only hope is to use a device that would allow a psychologist (psychiatrist? social worker? just plain cutie that we can feel protective of? I was never entirely sure on that) to enter the killer's mind and establish communication with him. This role is played by Jennifer Lopez in what has to be one of the more bizarre - there's that word again - casting decisions ever made. There's nothing about Lopez that I can take seriously in this role. My wife said it best: ""does that look like how a professional engaged in serious work would dress?"" (and this was a ""real-life scene"", and not while she was in the killer's mind!)I say it all again: this is BIZARRE! But at the same time, if you can get past Lopez's non-performance, it's good fun, while at the same time totally unbelievable. I can give it a 6/10, and it probably would have been a bit higher if they had found someone more credible than Lopez to play the starring role.",The Cell
30,cherold,"Cool looking, creepy, and not very good",5,1 February 2014,"Visually, The Cell is a very impressive movie, creating interesting and imaginative dreamscapes. The explorations into the unconscious are standard Hollywood dreams - weird and creepy or peaceful and beautiful, but with more internal logic than really dreams - and when the movie is in this alternate reality, it's pretty good.Unfortunately, the movie spends a lot of time in the real world, where it's an unpleasant and unoriginal serial killer flick. The worst scenes are the fetishistically detailed portrayals of the killer torturing and killing his victims before toying with their bodies. These scenes are incredibly creepy and disturbing, which might be a plus for some people, but made the movie very difficult for me to watch.Remove the horrific and the dreamy, and you've got a pretty conventional find-the-serial-killer-before-it's-too-late movie that adds nothing to the genre.

The storyline should have been really riveting, but it was so pedestrian with the way they went along with it. The serial killer himself (Vincent D'Onofrio) is rather scary, and we do get some very striking visuals, but I just got bored with it after a while. It's all style and very little substance in my opinion. I also had trouble with the pacing. It flagged quite a bit in the middle, and my interest only perked up for the interaction between Vince Vaugh & Jennifer Lopez. It doesn't have that much suspense, when it should have a plethora of it. You have a really unique plot here, TAKE ADVANTAGE! It's watchable, but not very entertaining when all is said and done. Jennifer Lopez is adequate here, but also slightly inconsistent. I thought she was too blasé when it came to certain situations and I would have liked her to amp up her intensity. She's certainly easy on the eyes, and she nailed her scenes with Vaughn, but I thought she was off and on. Vince Vaughn has been middling with lame comedies for so many years now, I honestly forgot how good of a serious actor he can be. I enjoyed his intense show here, and he was the main reason that kept me watching, and I'm no Vince Vaughn fan. I don't care for the guy at all, but he has the ability to be a good actor when he wants to. Vincent D'Onofrio is one creepy dude and gave a solid show as the killer. He'll keep your attention, that's for sure. The acting (aside from Lopez's inconsistencies) isn't the problem hereFinal Thoughts: It was alright.

The good things that people say about this film such as great visual effects and great acting by the film's actors maybe true and the killer may have looked bizarre and the music is good by Howard Shore but that is all that is great about this film. Why don't I like it? Simply because this movie show its sucky scenes. It seems like the film can't make up its mind if it wants to show disturbing things or if it wants to show happy things. The film should have in My opinion took a different turn with the story. Why must there be Clive Barker like stuff in this movie? Some of the things were just completely unnecessary.

35,Dr_Coulardeau,Death by schizophrenia,9,30 August 2007,"To bring the mind of a serial killer, in that instance an extreme case of schizophrenia, to the front of the screen or the investigation to be able to save the last kidnapped victim planned to die by some mechanism that will drown her eventually, that's the ambition of the film. But does it make a real thriller? They use a technique that will eventually exist for the large public in the near future. The mind of a doctor or qualified medical personnel gets into the mind of the patient, in this case a criminal, in order to communicate with him and get the information the police needs to get on the track. Risky because with such schizophrenic people, there is only one world and it is theirs. You cannot enter their world without being an intruder and at once they react in making you captive, and you may eventually get catatonic with the patient's mind taking over your own mind. At first by making you their prisoner and later, with a reversal, which is for the medical personnel to let the patient's mind get into his or her mind, eventually to become the tool to satisfy the patient's deepest desire which is to dissolve in the outside world they cannot reach at all, except through your mind and then you are making them die virtually but it can mean real death since the mind controls all mechanisms of the body. It may also for a patient who is not totally enslaved by his death instinct mean a liberation, the desire being to be loved, to love, to be acknowledged. In our case here the attempt enables the medical personnel to satisfy the criminal's self-death instinct, and at the same time to enable the profiler to get into the criminal's mind and see the detail that will make it possible to trace the equipment and then the location of this equipment used to imprison, drown and eventually turn into a sex object the girl who is in the cage. The main interest is the visual exploration of this mental world in which this serial killer is living. The film insists on the triggering of this schizophrenia by traumas coming from his infancy, and particularly his father who, it is shown, brutalized him when a child, but also submitted him to a baptism by total immersion that will give him the model for his crimes as well as the model for his mental death. It is also implied that sexuality was associated to this brutalizing, hence molesting. Yet the question is asked and two points of view are expressed, one considering there is no escape and another considering that one can always manage to escape. This approach is doubled with the question whether it is genetic or accidental. Difficult to say but the film seems to satisfy itself with the idea it is a deep trauma, a deep trouble and that it is so deep that there is only one mental exit and it is mental death, in other words mental suicide. Do we have the right, as the medical personnel does, to help him get mentally killed, in other words to get there and kill him in his own mind? Ethically I doubt it but criminally there is no proof of any violence because it is all mental, virtual. And yet? And what can be the consequences on the medical personnel in time if that person takes pleasure in and becomes enslaved to this power over the minds of other people, to the point of killing them, morbidly satisfying their desire or turning themselves into doctor, police, judge, jury and executioner? No one has that right.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",The Cell
36,Rectangular_businessman,Cool visuals with almost nothing of substance.,4,8 May 2012,"Seeing ""The Cell"" it's like seeing a very long Nine Inch Nails/ Marilyn Manson music video with a shoehorned serial killer story : While I have to admit that some of the images displayed in this movie are actually impressive or fascinating to look at (Some scenes depicting the mental world of the serial killer are both beautiful and disturbing) the truth is that the main plot of the film is not interesting at all, being mostly shallow and filled with many clichés and stereotypes that have been done too many times before. In fact, almost all the events that take place in ""The Cell"" seem just ""excuses"" in order to show lots of weird imagery, combined with some forced symbolism that actually doesn't have very much to do with the plot in order to give this a ""deep"" appearance.Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn are pretty unconvincing in their respective roles, being the main reason of why I have hard time trying to care about their characters. Only Vincent D'Onofrio makes a decent effort in order to portray in a convincing his twisted character, despite all the amount of clichés concerning to the personality of the serial killer.And that's the main reason of why ""The Cell"" doesn't work. If a movie doesn't have a good story and the characters are uninteresting, not even the best visuals can save it. The overall weakness of the plot ruins all the effect that the impressive images have, making this a shallow experience, despite all the violence and disturbing content. Unfortunately, the excessive focus in the style rather than in the substance seems to be a common characteristic of the movies directed by Tarsem Singh, were the splendid visuals are overshadowed by the extremely weak scripts. At least in ""The Fall"", I was able to care about the main characters, and the plot wasn't as boring and pretentious as in this movie.Even with all the nightmarish content that it had ""The Cell"" was a forgettable experience for me.",The Cell

In that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were THERE. Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of this stuff has never been seen in film before.The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim, while in The Cell, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However, despite the unfortunately weak story, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None that have ever been made even come close to it. Also, the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great Out of Sight). Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit, it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history.

What we get is a thinly disguised plot similar to that of  ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) mixed in with a dose of ""The Fantastic Voyage"" (1966).  Jennifer Lopez, in her first film in two years, plays the psychologist who enters the mind of serial killer Vincent D'Onofino while FBI agent Vince Vaughn looks on. Lopez, who I assume chose this role in an attempt to play against type, looks sleepy and lost in the part of the psychologist. Vaughn is wooden as the FBI agent and D'Onofino was not at all frightening as the killer. The special effects and costumes though dazzling, would be better suited to one of Director Tarsen Singh's rock videos.

43,dfranzen70,Mindtrap,6,20 December 2000,"This eerie psychological thriller is laden with all kinds of special effects. I think they even tossed the kitchen sink, too. The basic plot is that there's this really hot-looking doctor (Jennifer Lopez) who undergoes this cool experimental procedure in which she enters the mind of another human being - in her case, a child in a coma. Her skills are tapped when an intrepid detective (Vince Vaughn) has captured a schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onfrio) who is in such an advanced state of psychosis that he's unconscious and is therefore unable to reveal to the police the location of his latest victim, who is apparently trapped in a cell-like glass container that has enough food and water for 72 hours, but no more (then, apparently, the cell floods - you may have seen that in the promos for the movie). Enter Miss Lopez, who wanders into this sicko's mind, finding out why he is what he is and trying her goldangist to find out where the young lady is.If nothing else, this is not a dull movie. In fact, the ""Wow, cool!"" quotient of The Cell is pretty high. Let's just say that if you're into mindbending horror films, this might be the one for you. There IS some gore, there's a whole lot of cussin', and quite frankly no one under 21 should see it. There's no sex, however (darn!). But there's a LOT of visual imagery. Kind of like Beetlejuice combined with Army of Darkness. There is a lot of torture and a few absolutely shocking acts. It's disturbing, never calming. And Lopez is the one who holds it all together. Many models-turned-actresses/singers can't hack it in more than one profession, but clearly there is some talent at work here. She's a delight, never innocent, but never in over her head, either. Her character is strong, resilient, and very intelligent. Vaughn, who doesn't have enough scenes with Lopez, plays against type as the take-charge lawman on the job (although he's a little stereotypical); I usually see him as the bad guy, but here he's Johnny Cop.

He then takes his victims to his house, dips their bodies in bleach and then masturbates (yes he does do it and it is disgusting) over the bodies with hooks inserted directly into his back and ditches the bodies so the FBI can find them.  Now the FBI have asked Catherine if she can go into his mind and try to find out where the missing girl is.  When she does go inside, she sees Carl as a young boy, sweet and innocent.  She also sees the darkside of Carl's mind, in which he has become what Catherine calls, ""An idealized version of himself.""  Now let me say that this movie is very beautiful, dark, and very twisted. 
Now it has also come to my attention that a lot of movies released during the summer of 2000 have received a wide range of reviews that range from incredibly good to incredibly bad.  Examples are Mission: Impossible 2, Hollow Man, and this film.  A lot of people have dissed this film for as far as I can see, no reason.  This movie is good and it should be a classic.*****/*****",The Cell
45,CubsandCulture,A repugnant ending ruins an otherwise fun thriller,6,24 October 2019,The script was never going to going to get high mark for being insightful or for that matter originality but much of it is just competent enough to allow the director to focus on what he wants. In this case it is some trippy visuals that cribs from German Expressionism. It is true that the film nails the dreamlike-nightmarish tone of being in a deranged mind. The visual scope of the film is is vast indeed and with the discordant soundtrack it creates a hypnotic quality. This is like the perfect movie to have on in the background of a Halloween Party.Alas the script decides to have the final story beat an extrajudicial murder along with a terrible set-up of character building trying to justify the immorality of it. The ending sours the entirely experience and commits major character assassination.This film is far less than the sum of its parts.,The Cell

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Utterly unique, surreal, beautiful nightmare",10,3 July 2015,"Tarsem Singh's The Cell is the kind of revelatory, mind blowing, breathtaking, once in a decade kind of fantasy film that is utterly unique, truly memorable and pure artistic creation. Singh utilizes so many visual elements and ideas that you get the notion that you are truly immersed in a human being's subconscious inner realm, and not merely watching a film. It's transcendent. Jennifer Lopez, in a performance of great empathy and serious emotional depth, plays a child psychologist who uses futuristic technology to literally enter the dreams of comatose patients and attempt to heal them. When a seriously disturbed killer (the monumentally talented Vincent D'Onofrio) enters a coma before the FBI can find his latest victim, she is hired to enter his mind to find out the location. A scary setup indeed. The first plunge into his mind is set up with a dread inducing soundtrack cue, and a sudden, Topsy turvy whirlwind of surreal images, sounds and stimuli which are truly eerie and intangible. The art direction, special effects and design of the spirit realm she ventures into are just something you don't see in many films, because most people are afraid to think about that kind of raw, uninhibited subconscious content. Not Singh. He willingly explores the dark, mysterious side of the human mind and soul, with a complexity and understanding that is all to rare. For folks who find that too much surreal imagery and soul disturbing content makes them uneasy (hell, I'M one of those folks) those aspects are balanced out by the clean cut, very grounded in earth time plot line of Vaughn's team helping him out from 'earthside', a standard cops vs. killer mentality to even out the strangeness. They even have a guy from CSI playing one of the cops. Vince Vaughn feels slightly miscast as the head fed, but James Gammon, Dean Norris, Dylan Baker, Marianne Jean Baptiste, Patrick Bachau and Musetta Vander all give stellar support. If you have a strong stomach (this film gets pretty brutal in ways you can't imagine), and a wandering, artistically abstract mind for all things surreal and dreamy, definitely check this out.",The Cell
50,drownnnsoda,Thoroughly Bizarre And Visually Amazing.,8,9 June 2007,"In ""The Cell"", Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine Deane - a psychotherapist who is part of a new-found procedure that allows a person to enter the mind of another person. This special procedure gets a new kind of use when Catherine is asked to enter the mind of a recently captured, very demented comatose serial killer who tortures his victims before killing them, in an attempt to find out where his most recent victim is at. In a race against time, Catherine begins a disturbing journey into the psychopath's mind to try and save a young woman's life that is hanging in the balance.Among the vast pool of serial-killer/detective movies, I can confidently say that ""The Cell"" is likely the most bizarre of any of them. Story-wise, in some instances this film may not seem like much of anything original - detective trying to save a helpless victim from a serial killer in a race against time. In that aspect, it's really not original. However, the spin on the story is the entering of the killer's mind, and the utterly bizarre and disturbing things that can be found in there. The psychopathic murderer in this film is one twisted man, and we learn this before we actually enter his mind, after seeing him hanging himself from hooks and tormenting women, among other things. But the real genius of this film is the somewhat futuristic/sci-fi element of the mind exploration. It's a magnificent idea that hasn't been elaborated enough, and this film does it well.But the most disturbing thing about this film is the twisted, bizarre imagery that we see on display inside of the villain's head. The set decorating, colors, and the general scenario of these scenes are beautiful but terrifying - it's all pure eye candy. The sounds, visuals, and overall atmosphere of the internal-mind sequences are abstract, stunning, and haunting. I can't even begin to describe it, it's something you have to see for yourself. Serious credit needs to be given to the set designers and cinematographers, they did an amazing job, as well as the script and the director's vision (I believe the director of this film is known for directing music videos, which makes sense). Vincent D'Onforio plays the twisted killer excellently, and is the best thing about the film. And while Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn (who also give solid performances) are considered the 'main' characters, we really learn more about the killer than we do anyone else. I'm not sure if that's a bad or good thing, but it is interesting.All in all, ""The Cell"" is a severely strange film, but it is also an excellent and very scary experience. Visually, this film is a complete knock-out, and the story is written well enough also. If you would like to see a (very) different psychological crime/horror film, ""The Cell"" is likely your cup of tea. As for me, I thought it was very well-done, and probably one of the strangest but most visually enthralling films I've seen in quite some time. 8/10.",The Cell
51,davispittman,Very intelligent film,8,26 February 2016,"The Cell (2000) is definitely a very well made and smart movie. The costume design and the visuals are both so stunning and they are so meticulously done so that the audience really gets the full effect of the atmosphere. Jennifer Lopez really outdid herself here, her role in many movies is mostly comedic and light, but her role went through some really disturbing traumatic stuff in The Cell, and she pulled it off wonderfully. Vince Vaughn was pretty good in his part, he certainly looked the part. The rest of the cast did well too, no one actor really gave a bad performance in the film. The dialogue was well written in my opinion. The plot was well constructed and developed I might add. The execution of the material was strong throughout the film. This movies atmosphere is really awesome! It's incredibly suiting for the movie. And that Academy Award nomination for Best Makeup was oh so well deserved, the makeup was amazing here, especially oh JLo's part. 8/10 overall, entertaining well made film.",The Cell
52,MarieGabrielle,Astonishing visuals....,8,30 July 2007,"This film is something you may remember, dream about and even be frightened of a few years after you have seen it.Director Singh and the cinematographer are to be commended for what almost translates to abstract art on screen.The acting requires a bit of suspension of logic, but Lopez does well, looks stunning, and if you can ignore the performance of Vince Vaughn as detective you will enjoy this film.Basically, Jennifer Lopez is a psychologist who must enter the mind of serial killer, 'Starger' (well-portrayed by a frightening Vincent D'Onofrio). Abused since childhood, the killer has endured a private hell, and Lopez finds herself drawn into it, so as she may rescue his most recent hostage. There are scenes of the desert, stark and vibrant. A horse and young boy, fleeing from a horrific phantom image. The ""king"" in the young boy's mind is actually the writhing twisted spirit of the serial killer. It is a character drawn out of a novel by Marquis De Sade, an unspeakable evil which fantasizes about twisting human innards and organs, many of the visuals are seemingly lifted from De Sade's tales of horror.Lopez also has a later scene wherein she looks like a religious Madonna, cherry blossoms and scarlet robes. Visually beautiful. Well worth watching. 8/10.",The Cell
53,rbverhoef,The least it does: looking great,7,29 January 2005,"'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carl's mind.It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.",The Cell

She stars here as a psychologist who agrees to undergo hypnosis in order to enter the mind of a serial killer who murders women for thrills. The FBI believes this is their last resort as every last attempt to catch the sicko has only led to more victims being kidnapped and more bodies turning up. Vince Vaughn plays an FBI agent hot on the sicko's trail. The best part of the film are the visually stunning images that you see once Jennifer Lopez's character enters the mind of the killer. The plot begins to unravel as she proceeds from one corner of his mind to another, revealing his past, childhood and other darks secrets until she finally comes face to face with the monster within.",The Cell
55,eric262003,Too Many Visuals With A Paper-Thin Plot,5,11 January 2020,"We can see where this is going. I may have said this many times before and I might just be saying the same things with different wording, but I can tell that whenever a movie treats to the world of visual eye-candy chances are that all we get from it. In ""The Cell"" the visuals might be among some of the best in the film industry, but then after that what is there to offer? There's very little plot, there's really no character development and the script is just contrived, cliche and lazy. In the silent age of movies, ""The Cell"" would have been ahead of its time, but in this day and age, a plot and decent story is mandatory. Otherwise this movie is nothing more than a glorified picture show you could see in a museum.The plot of the movie is similar to ""The Matrix"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs"" except that it's very inferior to those movies. The thin plot focuses on a brilliant young therapist named Dr. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) who has found a way of literally and physically entering into the minds of comatose patients to see what is malfunctioning inside. She has the back-up from specialists made to look and act important and an apparatus complete with computer panels and licorice looking wires hanging from the ceiling.In the opening scenes, Dr. Deane has used her new device to enter the mind of comatose young boy and had successfully helped him break free from it. Things start to get darker and creepier from these as her new case progresses. Her latest subject comes in the form of a sick, twisted psycho serial killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) who got a bit sloppy with his latest victim and is about to be arrested. It might be too late because he is now in coma and may be near death, and so will his latest victim who's location is unknown and only he knows where she is. So Dr. Deane must enter his mind to trace where she's located and finds images in his inner mind that to put it vaguely are not very pleasant.Stargher's method of torturing his victims is original in unorthodox but it's still, vile, grotesque and disgusting and the images could be very disturbing. His targets are young women, puts them in a cell which comes with a glass enclosure that slowly gets filled with water encased with an automatic timer. He also uses a hoist in his basement as a means to suspend himself above their bodies while he records them as they die. What a gentleman? Through all that macabre ritual, there's never any back story as why he chooses to kill his victims this way. All I know is that we're treated to a lot of demented sexual pleasures and a myriad of flesh.So while Deane has to dig deep to find this shower cell where the victim is held hostage, and from there, the picture show begins and the plot ends. Sure this inner dimensional theme park attraction may be creative from an artistic standpoint, but from a cinematic standpoint, that's a whole new ballpark. This approach is very archaic and quite obsolete in the style of film making. Former MTV director Tarsem Singh seems to have two methods of directing. The first being getting all that wasteful plot devices out of the way and the second going on the haunted house amusement park to look at creepy, macabre images that feel like an over-extended music video rather than a movie.And while the plot itself is formulaic and routine, the haunted house theme park wears out its welcome rapidly. If the plot would have included something of entertainment or originality, maybe this movie would have been a lot better. Due to the failed narrative and lack of a compelling story, ""The Cell"" is just a room full of party decorations but no party.Performance wise, Jennifer Lopez may be easy on the eyes but her acting was atrocious who I always felt she was overrated. She was cast in the lead obviously for her looks and nothing more. Vince Vaughn is badly miscast as the FBI Agent Peter Novak as tries to play roles outside of comedy, he just can't seem to. D'Onofrio who I usually like might have the better performance compared to Lopez and Vaughn, but his role was just made to look scary and his dialogue is underused as he's basically rendered to just whining and screaming.The biggest letdown of ""The Cell"" lays blame mostly to screenwriter Mark Protosevich for writing a lazy script and that the weight of this movie was mostly on the shoulders of Tarsem Singh. Singh who went onto direct REM's 'Losing My Religion"" was far more fun to watch and had an aura of amusement that you won't find in ""The Cell"". At least in the REM video, Singh didn't need to depend on dialogue to get his movie across.If you only wanted to watch the movie for the visuals, then I'm the last person stopping you from seeing it. I give credits that the visuals were very impressive. But I just feel that if I'm being fed meat and potatoes for supper, then feed me the main course, don't just give me the gravy. ""The Cell"" is just that with the visual being the gravy, and the plot and the story that's supposed to be the meat and potatoes just isn't there.",The Cell

Given the name & what type of film it was (horror) I of course was interested, that, & it had a sequel to it.The films plot is very little but it's about a serial killer who murders women & these group of scientists test out this virtual reality type machine out to get into the mind of this serial killer. Something like that, but you know a film is bad when you can't even describe the plot.This film was bad. There was no plot, no character development & no story. It was basically 100 minutes of plot devices, sci-fi scenes slapped together & drab dialogue. I couldn't understand the story at all, it felt rushed & skimmed over. A lot of the time I was sitting there confused as the film played out. No obvious, clear or coherent narrative to speak of.

57,philip_vanderveken,"Not as good as The Silence of the Lambs, but enjoyable.",7,20 December 2004,"The Cell is a weird movie with absolutely stunning special effects and scenes. The story however is a bigger problem. It isn't very original as it has stolen much of the ideas from The Silence of the Lambs (a serial killer kidnaps young women, kills them and does something weird with them), but thanks to the many special scenes, it was quite enjoyable. A company has found a way to enter someone's mind. They use it to get access to schizophrenic people who are in a coma. One day the FBI needs the company to help them. They have arrested a schizophrenic serial killer that has kidnapped and killed several girls in a gruesome way. He's in some kind of coma and will never wake up out of it again. They desperately try to make contact with him, because they want to find his latest victim, who they believe is still alive. As I already said this movie really has a lot of similarities with The Silence of the Lambs. The main difference between the two is that this movie has added an element of science fiction to it, while The Silence of the Lambs had a more realistic feeling. Normally I would have hated the Cell for that, but thanks to many special, dreamlike scenes, I enjoyed it, however not everything about the movie was as convincing as I would like it to be. All in all this is an entertaining movie. It's certainly not as good as The Silence of the Lambs, but it sure was worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10.",The Cell
58,begob,Beautiful and shallow,6,3 April 2015,"Ticking clock police procedural using psychic investigation.I saw this years ago, but forgot about it. On rewatch it reminds me of lots of influences, especially in the visuals in the dream scenes. Opening sequence is really striking and left me wondering if the pyramids in Egypt were modelled on the sand dunes. Anyhow, there's plenty of Gilliam in there, some Beckett, and other reviewers have referenced several artists, eg. Hirst for the horse slicing. And the plot has dollops of Silence and se7en.Well worth looking at, but sadly forgettable. It's big production, big stars, so there's no sense that things might not work out. The psychology of the victim is ignored. And the morality is pure Hollywood, where means justifies the end - no thought given to the ethics and legality of killing someone to save another, especially when the kill comes after they've found the badly hidden crucial clue.Plus there's no sex - guys, you're messing with the subconscious. Marian symbols don't cut it.Overall it looks great but only engages through tension.",The Cell
59,moviewizguy,A Retrospective: Ahead of its time,10,31 July 2015,"Let's just get this out of the way: I absolutely loved The Cell. I loved it in my first viewing and have continued to love it in subsequent viewings. Why? Well, visually speaking, it was ahead of its time, and by today's standards, its imagery has remained unmatched. A film like this would have never been able to get made today, one in which a studio would put millions of dollars into an R rated film that could turn the audience off due to its perverse visuals. Only Tarsem Singh could have created such beauty and disturbing imagery in a directorial debut. But what about the story, you might ask. Yes, I have to admit the story may be secondary, reminding one of The Silence of the Lambs, but remember, this film did dream heists before Inception did.With all this talk about the film's visual execution, some may say that The Cell is merely style over substance. However, I'd argue the style *is* the substance. The film is like an empty canvas where we can witness Tarsem's crazy and absolutely beautiful imagination. Still 15 years later, the visuals hold up incredibly well, provided without some dated CGI, but those are easily forgiven with the many things the film gets right with visual storytelling. Even scenes that take place outside the dream world are shot meticulously, every frame a painting (thanks Tony Zhou for the phrase). The film's cinematographer, Paul Laufer, should be given some recognition as well, providing some of the film's unconventional camera movements. It's a surprise to learn Laufer hasn't shot a film since The Cell, only working on music videos. Sadly, he's a talent untapped by Hollywood.The soundtrack by Howard Shore nicely complements the look of the film, providing a necessary momentum that slowly builds towards an explosive finale that is emotionally compelling as much as it is visually stunning. Despite the flack she gets, Jennifer Lopez is quite good in the film, who gives her character enough layers to be engaging. A young Vince Vaughn is also very good in his role as the FBI agent with an intriguing past the film doesn't delve too deep into. Lastly, Vincent D'Onofrio is outstanding as the film's complex antagonist, effectively playing the different facets of what could have been a forgettable, two dimensional villain. Overall, The Cell is an incredible film, unforgettable in its visual execution. Although the story is familiar, it is nonetheless involving with good performances from the actors who carry it. One wonders whether the film would work better today due to the vast progress of technology, but for now, The Cell is irreplaceable, with no other films that can rival it. At least, visually speaking.",The Cell
60,punishmentpark,The mind can be a stunning thing to exhibit...,7,6 January 2014,"On the artwork, special effects and what not: there is a lot of stunning, beautiful (at many times harrowing) 'stuff' here, a few things are not so great and very few details were simply awful to look at - but all that is probably a matter of taste. The story is rather thin, and the fact that the 'Carver' lead was already right there before anyone had to go into the mind of Carl, is what you might call a plot-hole deluxe - but then we wouldn't have seen what we saw...The acting is pretty much okay, with Vincent D'Onofrio stealing the show - of course. I was much more enthusiastic about 'The Cell' when it first came out; now it remains a film that I love to watch for its artwork, and I shudder at its horrors, but the lack of depth (in characters and story lines) makes the whole thing rather unsatisfactory.But again: it's really quite something just to look at, so: 7 out of 10.",The Cell

This one would be perfect for her if only it was a five minute music video.To be honest, the director kicked royal butt with his images. The story is as silly as they come and a rip off of many other films in this genre. Jennifer Lopez played Catherine as a very boring, wimpy female character, but ya know if she sang it as part of a music video promotion, it would have worked.Who CARES who else was in this film, it was the director's film 100%.

63,baumer,Tries to go one step further into the realm of disgust..,4,31 January 2001,"There is just something about Jennifer Lopez that really bothers me.  She just rubs me the wrong way.  Now I realize that many guys would like her to rub them any way possible, but that is a discussion for another time.  But something about her as an entertainer just irritates me.  That too is a discussion for another time.  But with that in mind I went to see this film and really tried to discard my animosity towards her; because I had heard and read that this was a great film.  I Like films like Seven and Kiss The Girls and The Bone Collector.  Films that have a sick killer that have to be caught before they wreak havoc and kill again.  But there are few problems with this film and to be honest, most of them have been covered in previous reviews.  However, there are a few more that I have to comment on so bear with me.First of all, I am not privy to see what kind of box office draw Lopez is over seas.  I would however like to know what kind of power she has because I have heard in certain circles that she is about to be elevated into Julia Roberts status when it come to paychecks.  And this is something that I just can't fathom.  The Cell opened well enough at 17.5 million and then went on to gross a very respectable 61.3 million dollars, good for 36th place in the year 2000.  Similarly, The Wedding Planner opened at 14 million and will probably go onto to gross about 50 million.  No one is denying that she has drawing power.  But to class her in the same category as Julia Roberts and perhaps Sandra Bullock is not fair.  Not only that but it will probably inflate her ego even more than it already is.  If I hear one more time how nice of an ass she has, I'll think I'll go crazy.  Looks are not always the deciding factor in a box office draw.  While Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks are attractive people, they are certainly not as physically appealing as Lopez and say Brad Pitt but they outdraw them because they pick the right roles. People don't always flock to see the hottest models, if that was the case them Carmen Electra and any number of models would have the biggest roles in Hollywood thrust upon them.  That is just an observation.  Back to the film.The Cell takes Jennifer Lopez and puts her into a very tightly fit suit that is apparently adequate and coducive for travelling into someone's mind.  I would think a pair of jeans and a t-shirt would be more comfortable but hey, I only took my first year of psychology before I went onto political science.  But I'll be sure to ask my university professor the next time I see him.  So, her job is to enter into people's minds to find out what deep catacombs they can enter and then discover what it is that either makes them tick, makes them go off or why it is they are comatose.  So now of course, there is a killer on the loose.  And this killer is even more twisted than Leatherface, more diabolical than Hannibal Lecter and more destructive than psychologically imbalanced than Kevin Spacey's character from Seven.  And that is my biggest problem with this film.  I think we have seen films like this before.  Sure, the entering into a killers mind via psychosis and fancy wires and such is different but that is all that is different.  What remains the same is all the psycho babble bull caca that every psycho has.  He was abused as a kid, his father was a bastard, he lived a sheltered abused life, his mother wasn't around, ya da ya da ya da Yoda.  Big deal.  That is nothing new in a film that wants to pride itself on on new ideas.  And in my opinion, while watching this film, I could seriously imagine a boardroom meeting at New Line between the head honchos there and the guys who had the idea for this movie.  The conversation would go something like this:New Line Guy: Hey, you guys saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre Right?Guys for the film: Yea, like twenty years ago dude.NLG: Okay, well I'm sure you saw Silence Of The Lambs and Seven, right?GFF: Oh yea, those were great kick ass films.NLG: Okay great!  Now, you see, I like the idea for the film, but it needs some more...how do I say this?  More ooomph.  You know, we've all seen the bad ass killer before.  You know, the f***** up nutcase that has bad childhood memories.  So what we need now is to make him even worse than the others.GFF: Worse than Lecter?  How do you do that?NLG: Je ne sais pas ( showing that he is a smart man, he knows French ) how about make him hang from hooks, you know like the ""dude"" from Hellraiser...GFF: Hellraiser?  What is that...NLG: Never mind, but he hangs from hooks that stretch his flesh and he does it because he only feels real when the pain is there, because you know pain is real.  ( Guys For Film are simultaneously fascinated and confused.  But they listen on ) And once we enter into his mind, you know do some weird things like split a horse into seventeen pieces with a giant blade because you know Psyche 101 says that abusive adults first experience aggression and abuse towards animals.GFF: Yea, I've heard that.NLG: And we can have some really scary times with his dad and then we can have a really hot actress play the chick that goes into his head and tries to save him and the audience will eat it up.GFF: (Collectively) YEAAA!! ( High fives all around ).I just look at this film and I see nothing original in terms of ideas. Everything is just looked upon to go a step further than what we have seen before.  The production design is a wonder and they should be commended for a fantastic job, but I had no interest in any of the characters.  And when you are apathetic towards your hero and villain, that is not good for the film.  I just don't appreciate the film the same way some other seem to. I do understand that there are only so many stories you can tell in Hollywood and that eventually they all get recycled but this is just not one of the good ones.The Cell is an average film with the most basic ideas to further a killers ruthlessness.  Stick with SEVEN, unless you just have to see Lopez in a bright shiny suit playing with the two Vinces.4 out of 10",The Cell
64,vithiet,"Very decent and entertaining thriller, quite creative with great visuals",8,30 December 2018,I am not sure why this movie got so much bad press and bad reviews. The acting wasn't that bad and the story is quite original and makes for a very decent thriller. And to top it off it is visually great and very creative. I liked it when it came out and still liked it when watching it recently as it's not aging badly.,The Cell
65,brchthethird,Stylistically inventive at the expense of a substantive story,6,17 July 2015,"Tarsem Singh has basically made his career on films that emphasize style over substance. Prior to this, I only saw a couple of his more recent efforts: MIRROR MIRROR, which I liked well enough, and IMMORTALS, which felt like Zack Snyder-lite and was a bit boring. I wasn't really expecting anything deep when I got this, and my expectations were met. Is it great? No, not really, but the potent cocktail of Tarsem's visual style combined with some (pop) psychological drama was enough to keep my interest throughout. The premise is that there is this technology which allows someone to enter the mind of another person. Jennifer Lopez plays a social worker who enters the mind of comatose patients to see if she can bring them back to consciousness. Vince Vaughn plays an FBI agent/profiler who is after a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) who likes to do some pretty twisted things to his victims. Fortunately, he's captured, but in a comatose state, therefore he has to team up with Jennifer Lopez to enter the killer's mind and try to find the location of the latest woman before she dies. The film actually takes its time getting started, establishing (however lightly), the principal characters. However, once the plot is set in motion it rarely stops. Anyone looking for extensive character development and logical plot might as well give up because you won't find it here. What you will find is an intriguing debut film from a distinctive visual stylist. If I had to describe the fantasy sequences, it would be like Jodorowsky and Del Toro mixed together in the style of a Marilyn Manson or Nine Inch Nails music video. Put simply, those particular sequences were very dreamlike and surreal, with echo-chamber dialogue, jerky cuts/editing, and semi-heavy color saturation. By far, this was the most interesting part of the film. However, the performances weren't bad by any means. Jennifer Lopez acquits herself nicely, and Vince Vaughn shows some range. Vincent D'Onofrio as the villain doesn't get as much dialogue, but a lot comes through in the physical aspect of his performance. On a side note, his hairdo in this film made him look like Philip Seymour Hoffman in BOOGIE NIGHTS. Of additional interest is the score by Howard Shore. Given that this is a thriller, there is, to some degree, a reliance on bombastic music cues that match the action but are still a little over-the-top. The parts I liked best were the quieter moments that featured native Indian instruments (Tarsem Singh is from India). The weakest aspect of the film is undoubtedly the script, which has an overly simple story, thin characters, logical errors, and clichés. There's also a last-act choice that had little motivation other than that it was referenced early on, so they might as well have followed through with it. For what it's worth I was never bored because Tarsem conjured up plenty of cool imagery to take my mind off of the relatively unimportant plot. And for style over substance, THE CELL isn't half bad.",The Cell
66,sarastro7,"Thoroughly unpleasant, highly predictable and not the least bit shocking (if you knew what to expect)",2,19 March 2005,"When The Cell originally opened five years ago, it was part of a smattering of movies about serial killers. I never liked such movies, so I passed it by, despite being a sci-fi buff. Now that I've watched the DVD at a friend's place, I can only say that my original instincts were on target.The movie did nothing for me as entertainment; it was unpleasant throughout, slow-moving and dull, and the decent actors just were not sufficiently interesting or attractive to make it worth watching.The ""Daliesque"" surrealism was not very clever at all, and only two or three scenes struck me as visually interesting; the one where the black dog shakes its head in slow-motion, and the one with the three women sitting in the same position (when Peter first woke up inside the killer's mind).To me, this was in almost every way a forgettable movie. It could possibly have been saved by more charismatic actors and a more interesting storytelling style, but... it wasn't.2 out of 10.",The Cell
67,jhclues,"Visually Stunning, Not Much More",7,11 September 2000,"A new level in the science of psychology is reached as the doctor is literally able to get inside the mind of the patient in `The Cell,' directed by Tarsem Singh and starring Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn.  An original, imaginative concept, being able to actually explore the mind of a schizophrenic from the inside, takes this movie into somewhat virgin territory; the story itself, however, is not all that new, something of a cross between `Silence Of The Lambs,' and `The Matrix.'  It is visually stunning, reminiscent of the `Mind's Eye' videos of the early 90s, but advanced, of course, in keeping with the latest technology.  The visuals are complimented with a driving, rhythmic score that is mesmerizing, especially when set against some of the wide angle shots of the superb cinematography. The scenes depicting the entrance into the patient's mind has the feel of Kubrick's `2001,' making the jump to light speed. 	Lopez gives a credible performance as Catherine Deane, who agrees to enter the mind of the demented Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), but the role isn't much of a stretch for her (nor would it have been for any capable actress).  She does have a wonderful screen presence, however, that blends nicely and actually adds to the already outstanding visuals, all of which makes for some truly memorable images.  Vaughn also does a good job as F.B.I. agent Peter Novak, but there's not a lot of depth to the character. There is some insight into what makes him tick, but it's not much; just enough to take him slightly beyond stereotype.  D'Onofrio's Carl isn't much of a stretch either, but he is frightening (especially in the sequences that show how he sees himself in his own mind), more thanks to a lot of makeup rather than any disarming psychological terror he may have wrought (Carl is a somewhat pale imitation of Hannibal Lecter). 	There are some outstanding supporting performances here, especially by Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Dr. Kent) and Jake Weber (Agent Ramsey); neither character is necessarily cut from original cloth, but they both run with what they have and make them credible.  Jake Thomas also does a notable turn as the young Carl Stargher.  What `The Cell' really delivers is a memorable visual experience that is quite a trip in and of itself; the creative imagery that alternates an almost claustrophobic sense with breathtaking expansive, pacific vistas is worth the price of admission alone.  That the story it frames is credible and interesting as well makes this a film worth seeing.  It won't leave you dizzy with excitement, but there are some tense moments that are going to make you sit up and take notice.  When all is said and done, this is a movie you're going to be glad you took the time to check out.  I rate this one 7/10.",The Cell

This movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your witts. Without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning ,middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special affects. The acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while. It is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation , so a lot of credit must go to Mark Protosovich the writer. 9 out of 10.",The Cell
69,stamper,An OK thriller with some very good moments,7,27 December 2000,"This not a really good film, but it is not a waste of money either. I practically enjoyed it, but cannot say it was good, because I had the feeling the movie could have been better and I feel that the reason it was not better was the director. Tarsem Singh really made a couple of good beautiful shots, but sometimes his way of making us see some things I just did not like. There was for instance that scene when Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) entered Stargher's (Vincent D'Onofrio) mind for the first time. That scene could have been so much better if Singh would not have decided to make it a dream sequence like he did, meaning that the color should have been normal and also the speech. Nevertheless that was one of the very good moments of this film. First of all the beginning of the scene with Catharine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) who reminded me of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi there. Lopez had something of a cat suit instead of a bikini though and I must say she looked very good in that (the hair (two tails all black with red endings), the make up and the red neck - thing did their jobs too though). The whole thing that follows then, between her and Vaughn really was sexy (almost had me a ., well I'll better not tell you kids that) and the rest of the scene in which Lopez wears that costume' is justdisturbing. My other favorite scene is the whole ending, from the arrows until it is over. It is just so intense, I must give Singh credit for that.
What can I say about acting, well all were good (I especially liked the Lopez arrow  scene attitude (call me crazy but I like me a feisty female every once in a while)), but D'Onofrio definitely stole the show as the totally whacko, freaked out lunatic. Maybe he was even a bit too good. I know there is no Oscar here, but he was believable and that's what counts.
Apart from that, you know there has been some commotion over the fact that Lopez' has a rather enormous butt, well I got a good glimpse of it when she went to the fridge in the movie and all I can say is that I liked what I saw. By the way, in this movie, there was some attention spend on the well formed body Lopez has, but be not fooled by the R rating for nudity, it is not her that is nude.

If I set forth to state the premise of The Cell, it'd take about 3 minutes to do so, which is 2.5 minutes too long. The mythos is bizarrely reticulated, both quantitatively AND qualitatively, as in; some of the elements of the belabored premise individually strain credulity past the breaking point.But.... what a visual marvel! En route to driving home the over-wrought concept I daresay you will get your money's worth just in terms of the strenuously-yet-delicately wrought dream sequences.I should add a touch of the snob, here. Bunuel taught me that dreams in movies should dance on the fault line between the inscrutable and being amenable to pithy interpretation. Are these dream sequences so amenable? Yes and no.If it weren't for the extreme nature of the mythic aspect--that is, if they'd been able to drape the amazing visuals over a neater, more streamlined premise--It would've rated at least one more star for sure.So I guess that sums it up. If amazing art direction to flesh out an over-wrought premise is OK with you, the flick is definitely worth watching.",The Cell

The problem is the killer is in a coma so to get at what's in his head, the psychologist must enter it.The movie really cut a new path through serial killer territory since much of it takes place literally inside the killer's mind.

The killer here is truly in his most twisted little alcove of seclusion and there are some truly twisted things there. The movie is made by a first time feature director, but one with a good visual flair. The surreal settings and genuine gruesomeness give their share of thrills and chills.However, since we are in the killer's mind the outcome could have been a bit more original in addition to the set up.

Lopez is a little too glamorous in the central role, though she acquits herself well enough amongst the excesses of Singh's 'mindscape' set-pieces, which alternate between the bizarre, the beautiful and the obscene, often within a single sequence. Culture vultures will have a ball spotting the wealth of pop references (eg. the punchline of the notorious 'horse' sequence was clearly inspired by the works of Damien Hirst), and while the plot doesn't really amount to much, the film derives most of its impact from the twisted grotesqueries conjured by Mark Protosevich's clever screenplay. In the process, Singh generates more than a little sympathy for D'Onofrio's serial killer, whose monstrous pathology was shaped in childhood at the hands of his abusive father, though Singh is careful to balance this compassionate approach with the pain and suffering inflicted on D'Onofrio's traumatized victims. Too grim for some tastes, the movie scores points for trying a new approach to old material.

His latest victim-to-be has to be rescued, before she dies in her cell, with a little help from Jennifer Lopez who can lay an intricate relationship with the serial killer. Well that's yet too much from Silence of the lambs. And not very well set up. The problem is there is no appalling and fascinating Hannibal Lecter in it.

As a trained psychotherapist, I can say that the basic premise and setup of the psychodelia was very accurate, and entirely plausible. Really. I cannot say enough about this movie, except to add: Of all the movies I have EVER seen in my life, this was the only time I ever had the feeling that the director's vision was fully actualized on the screen.

75,Movie-12,One of the most visually stimulating movies ever made. **** (out of four),9,17 September 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)
""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things.""--Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. With a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind-probing, ""The Cell"" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the year's most engrossing films.Making his feature film screenwriting debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for ""The Cell"" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests, mind-probing and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination.The film combines two major narratives, one about scientific exploration of the human mind, and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her empathetic personality, scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in hopes to revive his brain into waking.A sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. Within an abandoned rural farmhouse, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they draw near, until now. A violent seizure renders him comatose. The FBI captures his forever unconscious body. Unfortunately, he already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours, the cell will fill with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim.The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters the mind of Stargher, hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water, sending the woman to a watery grave.The science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it is worth the wait. It is far fetched, but that doesn't matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you don't suspend disbelief, however, the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy.According to the film's production notes, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director, named Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning art direction, and highly developed abilities to tell a story. ""When I wrote 'The Cell',"" explains Protosevich, ""I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painter's paintings or photographs while I was working. So I'm thinking visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director. Tarsem has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration.""Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have accomplished his character any better. He delivers a mysterious, disturbing, and engaging performance. ""I think that my character is, in a way, trapped in himself,"" D'Onofrio ponders. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character. His in-depth performance preparation pays off beautifully.While the actors, writer, and director do wonders with their material, the real honor goes to the film's behind-the-scenes talent. The director of photography Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of ""The Cell"" to life. It's is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings. Some movies you watch, others you experience. ""The Cell"" falls into the later category.",The Cell
76,the red duchess,"A tentative, but welcome, new direction for mainstream cinema.",6,5 December 2000,"You can say what you like, but it's a rare Hollywood movie that leaves you baffled at its content, rather than the fact that it ever got made.  I think there should be MORE pretentiousness in the movies, not less; the future of CGI lies surely not in  trying to 'realistically' recreate lost civilisations, or in mimicking monumental natural disasters, where you can quite clearly and bathetically see the joins, than in magicking up strange worlds of pure artifice, like 'Mission Impossible 2' and this. 
Any film would find it hard to beat that opening - Jennifer Lopez, resplendent in a feathery white, regal gown, astride an ebony black horse riding across the desert, huge, gleaming, yet miraculously tidy sandscapes, a tiny, beautifully white dot climbing these ephemeral mountains.  It's like a magnificent parody of a Depeche Mode video, in colour.  I could watch hours of this - doesn't everyone want to see their dreams filled with a huge budget and otherworldly colour?  Then the problems start.  The dream figures talk, the frayed box of Freudian tricks is opened, narrative, interpretation, explanation, purpose, all the things dreams expel, force their way in, like a clumping great boot stomping on a bubble.  This is why subsequent 'dreams' or entering into others' unconscious, feel like a bit of a cheat - we are always aware of their narrative significance, or their status as character shorthand - when one terrible crisis is reduced to childhood abuse, I groaned. 
And the 'real world' of the detective wins.  These two worlds, that of the detective, and that of the dream adventurer/'psychologist' are gendered in a hackneyed way - the male detective active in solving the crime, can invade the passive world of the female, where she is active only in her mind, but not the other way round.  And just when you're enjoying the exquisite dream worlds, you are thuddingly reminded of the plot - those worlds are so compelling that I don't think anyone would have noticed if we got lost there - when the 'real' and 'dream' worlds got confused for a brief moment, I though the narrative was going to excitingly collapse into real ambiguity, but have no fear.  Because in outline the whole thing is quite traditional, maverick cop, psychological crime story etc.  You hope, like 'Vertigo' or 'Memento', that Novak (see!) will get sucked into a demented mental labyrinth, but he recovers his psychological gung-ho with unconvincing ease.Never mind.  The encouraging thing is that films like this are being made and making money.  The dreams themselves are full of wonderful visual registers, my favourite being the echoes of Joseph Cornell, the Marquis de Sade and Bollywood.  The emphasis on sexual traumas is predictable but refreshingly direct.  Some day we will be able to ditch stories and wallow in this expensive fusion of desire, colour, set-design, beautiful stars as an abstract whole that doesn't need explaining.  Until then, enjoy.",The Cell
77,FlickJunkie-2,Your worst nightmare come true,7,5 January 2001,"To say that `The Cell' is not a pleasant movie would be a gross understatement.  It is a twisted and nightmarish examination of the inner workings of the mind of a psychopath.  The story is a standard race against time by the police to save the psycho's next victim, which is just an excuse to make a demented mind torquing horror flick.The device for delivering this disturbing fantasy is novel.  Technology allows therapist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) to enter the mind of a monster who conveniently goes comatose while his next victim is on autosnuff in a tank that is programmed to fill with water before the movie ends.  Her mission is to transport herself into his sick mind and get his confidence so she can find out where the girl is hidden.  Once inside, writer Mark Protosevich and former music video director Tarsem Singh (directing his first feature film) have carte blanche to let their imaginations run wild, no longer limited by the mundane forces of the physical world.  They pull out all the stops and deliver an ingenious and gruesome adventure that is garishly photographed and deeply disconcerting to the most placid of viewers.  Singh gets high marks for his innovative perspectives in bringing the wry dream world to life.  He has a very good eye and there are some beautiful shots, especially the desert scenes.  Clearly, his music video experience broadened his creative boundaries, which was a plus in shooting a film without any.Jennifer Lopez is a good actress who has let her publicity exploits eclipse her acting ability.  She was in this film more for her looks and outrageous sexiness than her acting, though she did a good job considering her role. She gave it her best shot at creating a sympathetic character, but unfortunately, the effort was lost amid the gore and sensationalism.  Her love of outlandish garb came in handy in this film.  Vincent Donofrio was marvelous as the beast.  He appeared convincingly disturbed, and he was imposing as the monster in the dream scenes.This film is more form than substance.  The story was weak but the horror was strong.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the imaginative direction and photography.  Horror and Lopez lovers add another 1 or 2 points.

Out-dated supposed special-effects are splashed about the film rather like a bad cook would throw in any kind of ingredients in a cake without much idea of what the resulting mess is going to be like: indigestible is the usual outcome, and in this respect the film scores.Whether it is worth fantasizing over Ms. Lopez, who looks nice on one of my screensavers, I leave it to you; but it occurs to me that there are ordinary young ladies walking down my street every day who seem to me far more desiresome and might well be called López, too. Such are the benefits of living in sunny Spain.Inasmuch as this film is rather mindless twaddle and that Ms. Lopez is far from being any kind of serious candidate for actress - as is frequent among other members of the top-model beautiful people squad jetting around all over the place, you would well spend your time twiddling with buttons on your remote control and follow the excitement of a goalless draw on another channel; the ""injured"" player is a far better actor and/or stunt-man, and there aren't any horrendous special-effects to mess up the real effects.",The Cell
80,Eumenides_0,Visionary Tarsem Singh's Visionary Debut,8,15 January 2011,"There is no other 2011 movie that I'm more anxious to watch than Tarsem Singh's Immortals, a new retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Titans. Singh is one of the most visually innovative directors working today but in eleven years this will be his third movie. His refusal to compromise his vision has made him an abnormality in Hollywood. His last movie, The Fall, came out in 2006 and was self-financed; it was the most beautiful movie of that year and no one saw it; it barely had distribution and didn't make a huge profit. But it has created a following. When I saw this movie I thought two things: 1) I couldn't wait to watch his next movie; and 2) he couldn't possible surpass himself.Well, regarding the second one it turns out he already did, with his 2000 debut The Cell, a movie that is hard to categorise because it mixes horror, science fiction, mystery, fantasy and drama in one single coherent and fascinating story. But for simplicity's sake let's call it a horror movie.Serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) becomes comatose shortly after kidnapping a new victim. The police know, from Stargher's modus operandi, that if she isn't found soon she will drown inside an unbreakable glass cell that fills with water (Stargher kindly films the slow death and sends tapes to the cops). So it's up to FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn in a fine performance before his conversion into a mediocre comedy actor) to ask Dr. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) for help. You see, Catherine has helped develop a method that allows people to enter the minds of comatose patients to see if she can wake them up. Of course no one wants Stargher to wake up – they just want clues that can lead them to the final victim.The only problem is that Stargher's psyche has fragmented into three personalities: his abused childhood self, the adult Carl, and a demonic god-like creature that rules supreme over his fantasy mental landscape.I think this premise is good in itself and screenwriter Mark Protosevich deserves congratulations for it. It has a sense of urgency: a life is at stake, the clock is ticking, and the tension keeps us on the edge of our seats anxious to see how they're going to beat Stargher's omnipotent god personality and find out what they came looking for.But the visuals are the main attraction. When the movie takes place in the real world, it's nothing special to look at. But when it gets inside a mind (Stargher's isn't the only one that's visited) it's a parade of classic art-inspired sets, beautiful landscapes, otherworldly costumes (courtesy of Eiko Ishioka, the costume designer of Francis Ford Coppola's unforgettable Dracula), and architecture that mixes the ordinary with the fantastic. Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum, British artist Damien Hirst, and H.R. Giger (of Alien fame) are just some of the artists referenced by Singh in this vast display of artistic erudition. If you're an art fan, you'll have as much fun enjoying the story as you'll have spotting the references, although it's not necessary to know them to appreciate the movie. It's just an extra for people who like to dissect movies.Although the movie is gorgeous to look at, even when it's horrifying (and when it gets inside Stargher's mind the movie may reach uncomfortable levels of misogynistic and bondage imagery for some viewers), Singh also has a good grip on narrative. The first minutes show him deftly developing three different narratives – Catherine, Novak, and Stargher – and slowly making them run into each other until they become integrated.The movie, unexpectedly, also has strong humanist themes running through it. Catherine is a psychiatrist trying to cure comatose patients. We first see her inside a boy's mind trying to help him wake up. Catherine is all love and altruism. When she enters Stargher's mind she feels sorry for him even though he's a serial killer. Although most viewers would like to see Stargher meet a horrible end, Catherine tries to save him from his tormenting demonic ruler so he can have some peace at last. Catherine believes in forgiveness and it's no wonder Christian symbolism is another big part of the movie's imagery.The movie also takes time to show how Stargher developed his hatred for women and doesn't spare us the abuses he endured during childhood at the hands of his brutal father. Modern movies love absolute, mysterious evil – Anton Chigurh, The Joker, etc. – because it's cooler (and simpler to portray?) but the people who study and capture serial killers (people who know real evil, not Hollywood mass-consumption evil) will be the first to say that human monsters are made. So The Cell was quite refreshing and intellectual in this regard too.D'Onofrio steals the show whereas Lopez demonstrates once again that with a good screenplay she can give efficient performances (I've always liked her tough cop roles in The Money Train and Out of Sight), and Vaughn was quite a surprise in an intense dramatic role. Add to their performances a suspenseful story, then make art direction, make-up, costume design and cinematography integral characters of the story, and you have a mesmerising horror thriller that disturbs as much as it moves.Tarsem Singh's debut announced a brave new voice in Hollywood, a voice that audiences have barely heard yet but that carries greatness. Let's hope that with Immortals Singh finally receive his due.",The Cell
81,cariart,'Dreamscape' Meets 'Seven'...,7,8 December 2000,"If you are familiar with the Dennis Quaid 1984 science fiction thriller 'Dreamscape', 'The Cell' will seem like very familiar territory. Replacing the psychic talent Quaid utilized in the earlier film with cutting-edge 21st century technology, therapist Jennifer Lopez' 'spirit' enters a young patient's subconscious, and attempts to repair psychological damage from the inside out, by dealing with the 'demons' that lurk there. Her patient, a child in a coma from a traumatizing experience involving seals, lives in a desert world of magic, which Lopez handles with imagination and compassion. While she hasn't achieved a breakthrough, yet, her love and confidence is sufficient to keep funds for the project flowing.Meanwhile, in the 'real' world, a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, in another of his string of remarkable performances) is drowning then raping young girls, and a team of FBI agents, led by Vince Vaughn, are conducting a frantic manhunt, as yet another girl has disappeared. When evidence leads to the killer, they discover him in a coma, and a crisis arises; they only have 40 hours to discover the whereabouts of the latest victim, before the cell she is imprisoned in fills with water, and she drowns.There is only one avenue with a chance of success, and soon Lopez finds herself in the mind of a madman.This film is a visual 'trip', full of Dali-esquire imagery, and space/time distortions. While the plot twists are predictable (one wishes the imagination shown in the visual effects had been carried into the script, as well), the story will keep your attention, and Lopez proves that she can move from erotic goddess to religious Madonna in the same film, convincingly.If you want a really fascinating double feature, watch 'Dreamscape' AND 'The Cell', and compare the two films! But be careful...seeing the two films in tandem may give you some VERY unsettling dreams.",The Cell
82,ruby_fff,"See this instead of ""Hannibal"" or ""Hollow Man""",6,19 February 2001,"""The Cell"" - The subject matter is controversial and challenging. You can say it's a sci-fi techno crime plus psychoanalysis movie. That's quite ambitious already.Yes, it's scary, has its share of guts and blood, but it has more substance. A tight plotline, dramatic tension, cinematically challenging. It's a successful bold debut from director Tarsem Singh.A stylized piece it is. Visually stunning, creatively bold, imaginative imageries abound. If you appreciate theatrical art, graphical presentations, and studies of the mind and psyche, and not afraid to tread unknown territories, the dream sequences are definitely for you.
It's beyond your regular Hollywood crime suspense thriller, nor does it pretend to be a glamorous sci-fi techno movie. Tarsem Singh has given us more than our money's worth. He was able to amass all the ambitious elements and integrally presented to us ""The Cell.""Visionary exploration of mind-control therapy was demonstrated. It's exciting being led to such frontiers of medical science of what's seemingly possible, immediate future or not. The subject of child abuse was alluded to, certainly not superficially. Music application is also unconventionally bold: Middle Eastern sounds and instruments complement and enhance the film's exciting energy.Jennifer Lopez in her dream sequence costumes is simply too beautiful to behold. The brilliant Japanese woman designer Aiko Ishioka has a hand in this is indisputable.Vincent D'Onofrio, once again, demonstrated he's not afraid to take on out-of-the-ordinary roles, both psychologically and physically challenging. (If you'd like to take a break from all this, try ""The Whole Wide World"" 1996, directed by Dan Ireland; D'Onofrio with Renee Zellweger in a heartwarming film based on a true life story of a timeless friendship.)Vince Vaughn is the central FBI agent on the case encountering help from Lopez, along with Dylan Baker, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Pruitt Taylor-Vince in supportive roles. (If you'd like to see more of Vince Vaughn, he has a substantial role in ""Return to Paradise"" 1998, directed by Joseph Reuben. It's a thought provoking ""hard medicine"" film due to the moral dilemma prompted by the story; Joaquin Phoenix and Anne Heche also gave worthwhile performances.)""The Cell"" is truly an ambitious project. Singh also has to work with a child actor in this film for the dream sequences. He is undaunted, and what a quality result he delivered.

This could be the description to a number of children's fantasy films, if the child in question, were not within the psyche of a man who drowns women, hangs by his skin over their corpses and ejaculates on them as he watches recordings of them struggle.Full of uncommon ugliness and beauty, this sci-fi, cop, pop psychobabble extravaganza, somehow makes it's odd cast and visuals into something coherent and entertaining, much like Luc Besson's ""The Fifth Element"", where if you repeat the events of the film to yourself they don't add up to much, but the actual ""watching"" of the film and seeing all of the elements interconnect, make up for any slack in the story. I watched this again after ""The Fall"", and realized I'd never really given this a fair shake, but even Jennifer Lopez does a decent job here.

85,Al_The_Strange,"""In what world do you live in?""",9,19 October 2013,"Cases of serial killers can be sick as it is, but trying to analyze what could be going on in a killer's head can be a frightening and harrowing look into the face of evil itself. The Cell is a film that traps its characters, and the audience, in the mind of such a killer. Half of the film plays out like a pretty standard crime-thriller mystery, on a similar level to Silence of the Lambs. The rest of The Cell, however, is a truly unique odyssey.It can take a while to establish the initial plot points and concepts, but once the plot complications set in, the film dives into some very interesting and nightmarish territory. With the premise of characters literally exploring the subconscious of a killer's mind, the film progresses through a number of unforgettable sequences that are vividly weird, surreal, and extravagant. Some of the scenes are grungy and dark. Others are flowery and artistic. Most are freaky as hell. All of it is something worth seeing and remembering.The actual story is pretty simple, but it manages to cram in as much as it can, thanks largely to the association of imagery and symbols. Characters aren't the high point necessarily, but the main villain shows a lot of psychological depth that makes him stand out the most, for better or for worse.This film uses very stylish and awesome photography and editing, including a lot of unique camera angles and unusual movements. Acting is okay: it can be a bit hard to take Vince Vaughn or Jennifer Lopez seriously, but I think Vincent D'Onofrio was the best of the lot. Writing is generally okay. This production uses some extremely extravagant and imaginative sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's score is noisy and weird, for better or for worse.The Cell is a trippy experience. It has a cool plot that predates Inception, but it's probably most memorable for its far-out images and its freaky exploration of a psychopath's subconscious. If you think you can handle it, it's certainly recommended.4.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",The Cell
86,AKS-6,Better than expected,7,27 April 2001,"Style over substance... The Cell is a great example of that. However, I was pleasantly surprised that there was in fact more substance to this story than other reviewers have led me to believe. There _is_ an interesting premise in this film and even though there is no real depth here, The Cell is certainly no worse in the ""substance-department"" than other American serial killer thrillers. The story isn't exactly brilliant, but it was more than enough to keep me interested in the characters and the plot through the whole film.The visuals are, of course, dazzling in this movie. It's impressing to say the least. Some scenes look more like paintings than scenes in a movie. This also makes the film very fascinating.The acting... Well, Jennifer Lopez is in it and she's not a very talented actress. She's okay, I guess, but I would have wanted another actress to play Catherine. Vince Vaughn is okay, but Vincent D'Onofrio once again delivers a great performance. He was brilliant in films like Full Metal Jacket and The Whole Wide World and he is brilliant in this film as well. (7/10)",The Cell
87,chrisbrown6453,The Cell is a film that brings to the screen fantastical portrayals of its characters' subconscious minds.,6,9 July 2001,"The Cell initially focuses on child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) whose work with Dr. Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and scientist Henry West (Dylan Baker) involves using a brain-mapping device and a psychotropic drug, which allow her to enter the mind of another person and experience his or her thoughts and fantasies. Catherine uses this revolutionary method to enter a comatose child's mind in an attempt to bring him back to conscious life. Unfortunately, the therapy is not free of risk: wandering through another's subconscious worlds may alter the visitor's own perception of what is real and what is fantasy and consequently, jeopardize his or her sanity. When FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn: Psycho) tracks down serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio: Men in Black, Full Metal Jacket), who is found in his home in an unconscious state, Peter convinces Catherine to use the risky therapy on Carl and try to extract key information that would lead to Carl's last victim, a young woman who is still alive but trapped inside The Cell.The Cell tries to create a suspenseful story around a cop's efforts to capture the murderer and to save the next victim, and establishes the psychologist's interest in understanding the criminal's motives and in forgiving his actions. (In one scene that depicts a fantasy world, Catherine is portrayed in a way that resembles a Virgin Mary, reaching out to forgive/save Carl-the-child.) In spite of this intriguing premise, The Cell benefits most from the magnificent visualizations of Carl's subconscious fantasy world. When Catherine enters Carl's mind, she witnesses the freakish nature of his obsession to dehumanize his victims (which he turns into dolls), as well as the extravagant and depraved kingdom that he has built around his corrupted ego. Also, The Cell includes a series of tableaux that depict captivating surrealist landscapes and spectacular imagery depicting the fantasy worlds. These visualizations reflect the work of renowned production designer Tom Foden (famous for Janet and Michael Jackson's ""Scream"" and Madonna's ""Bedtime Stories"" music videos.) Furthermore, the impressive costume designs of Eiko Ishioka (Bram Stoker's Dracula) accurately complement the settings.
Unfortunately, in spite of the film's ambition to take the horror genre into unexplored venues, The Cell fails to fully integrate the visual representations of the antagonist's monstrous mind with the main narrative line. Thus, in spite of their own magnificence, the bold visualizations alienate rather than seduce the viewer. All in all, The Cell seems to squander its rich, visual artistry along the barren paths of its plot.",The Cell
88,PyrolyticCarbon,"Surprisingly good film, with unusual treatments and great tension.",7,22 January 2003,"Jennifer Lopez, and I almost hate to say this, is not actually bad in this movie. In fact, she turns a rather good performance. The story is extremely well thought through, and the locations of other peoples minds provides for some dazzling backdrops and costumes. The suspense of the slow execution of the serial killers final victim provides a healthy amount of tension, and the film doesn't get lost in the fantasy element, enough of the story is focused on the real world. It can be quite violent, and isn't scared to explore some of the gorier side of the serial killers' mind. It also leaves you with enough of a doubtful mind to wonder a bit longer than the titles.

Decent performances all round; particularly from Jennifer Lopez as Catherine Deane, I thought she played quite a tricky part very well and Vincent D'Onofrio as the serial killer, Carl Stargher. Also worthy of note were; Vince Vaughn in a rare dramatic role as Peter Novak, Jake Weber as Gordon Ramsey, Dylan Baker as Henry West, Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Dr. Miriam Kent and a special mention for Jake Thomas as the young Carl Stargher.I have rarely seen a film that has the scope of this one; it really tests the little grey cells to the maximum. Some scenes are truly off the wall but at the same time totally beautifully conceived and enthralling. It's a shame that the real-world story couldn't quite match the 'dream' world created by the director and his team. Even so, hats off to them for creating some truly stunning (and entirely bonkers) work! I'll admit some of the performances could have been better, but all the same that didn't mar my enjoyment.

It's basically a two hour music video full of interesting ideas that achieve nothing in particular.The Cell has a reasonably promising premise: Jennifer Lopez using a scientific device that allows her to enter the head of Vincent d'Onofrio's serial killer while Vince Vaughan sits around looking like Vince Vaughan usually looks in a film. Cue some nightmarish imagery and some craziness and you could be onto a winner.But it quickly becomes obvious no serious character study is going on here. Sure we're getting some creative visuals, but what they're telling us is actually pretty shallow. With a better script or more skillful director, we could have had a really interesting psychological thriller bought to life by quality actors in Lopez and D'Onofrio. Instead all we have is a lot of kind of arty looking stuff, some disturbing imagery, and talented actors struggling to bring life to characters straight from the cookie cutter.We are left with a film that despite having an interesting premise, good actors and stunning visuals, has nothing of value to say.

He mentioned several times in interviews, how ridiculous he finds the story and how stupid the screenplay is. For him, only pictures are important. And from this point of view, you must agree with him and admit, that the director achieved what he wanted: a huge storm of pictures. The story is extremely unimportant.If the virtual sequences were left out, this movie would run 30 minutes and it would be a bad copy of The Silence of the Lambs`. The virtual sequences are beautiful but they are full of pictures and symbols` that mean nothing. The problem with this thriller is that nothing is real and that's why I wasn't scared at all. This also makes it the ideal movie for Jennifer Lopez: Her unconvincing acting doesn't matter because everything around her is even less real than her character.I hope, there won't be other films like this in future. We have enough musical videoclips and they are not too short, no, they shouldn't be longer. It's not necessary to stretch them and transfer them onto the screen.

94,smakawhat,"Lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE!! Sandwich without the meat",3,22 August 2000,"I was very interested in seeing this film from the initial previews I saw on TV.  They had such cool visual appeal, and looked truly cinematographicaly (that's a mouthful) brilliant.  However, I was skeptical about seeing Lopez as an actress, and the other actors as far as I could see were nobodys.  Yet I really REALLY wanted to see this film, and was finaly getting around to some reviews just recently now that the film had been out. The impression I got from the reviews was evenly split..  So what's the final word in a nutshell...Simply put as this..  ""Lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE"".  This movie is nothing more than a typical televised cop TV show, with visual imagery that seems not to add to the story, but to cover up how ordinary and boring this film really is.  Lopez CAN NOT ACT!  I have read people saying that this film was truly terrifying and that D'Onofrino was the most amazing creppy serial killer on film.  WHAT??  what friggin movie did these people see??  D'Onofrino is HARDLY EVEN IN THIS FILM!! and comparisons to Perkins Hanibal... you have to be kidding me.  Instead D'Onofrino obsession doesn't even come out as twisted or frightning, it's just down right stupid and laughable.There is NO suspense, NO drama, NO thrilling-ness in this film. It isn't even scary!  Yes director Tarsem's imagery is fantastic, but it does nothing for the story.  You can have the greatest shots in a film and imagery, but a film needs to have A good story, and good actors too (which this film is SERIOUSLY lacking).  Instead I just kept waiting for the dream sequences so I could only admire the artistic value of it as if I was viewing a painting or a performance piece.  That sensations lasts for about 10 minutes.For someone who says that the only way you can enjoy this film is to enjoy the 'art' of cinema is a load of tripe.  Good cinematic art ALONE does not make a good movie, 'The Reflecting Skin' PROVES it.  Art in film needs to be coupled with good performances and dialogue, of which there are SEVERAL films that have done this well.  The Cell will NEVER be in this category.These are typical cardboard characters also.  The tortured killer, the determined cop, the sympathetic scientist... ya da ya da..  How could Roger Ebert, a guy whose reviews I find the most to my taste [and enjoyable to read], give this movie 4 stars out of 4??  Uggh...  Then of course it has to follow that STUPID cliche of the cop having to go in and save her, even though he is of course not a doctor.. GROAN...At the end I was waiting for them to just friggin follow the stupid line, and then fall in love, (hey if you're going to play a cliche play all of it).. kiss at the end, but they don't, so what's the point.  This movie is not worth seeing, or even renting.  I'll put it to you this way.  I know I have seen a good movie in a theatre when the ending credits come up and I don't want to get up and leave, like High Fidelity.  I know I have seen a bad movie when I am constantly looking at my watch, and looking for the door 3 minutes before the credits hit the screen.Rating 3 out of 10",The Cell

Flat out, it fails badly. The idea has been done before, in a video game called Killer 7 that most of you will never play or even take the time to look at, but Killer 7 does this splendidly and ends up being one of the most original things I have ever seen. This however, as I said, fails.First, I want to talk about the real world in this movie. It is represented through the mind of a serial killer, and that is represented to the off-beat flashbacks to his underground layer. In case you're clueless: the serial killer in this movie is so ridiculously typical and clichéd. He has a troubled childhood, he started out by killing animals, he has a layer, he only kills women, he has a childish side . . . is there a Hollywood cliché serial killer trait he doesn't have? I've studied real-life serial killers and I will be the first to tell you they do not all have the same cliché traits. So, really, if this director was honestly trying to do something different, he should have at least made the serial killer something other than a spineless pansy who likes to see women dead.Secondly, it steals everything technical from The Matrix. What more is there to say about that? It's so blatantly obvious I'm shocked there wasn't a copyright lawsuit.Third, the surrealist world. Though there were some cool environments, the cliché plot line made it all just stupid. Of course, according to cliché Hollywood, a killer is going to think of himself as a god in his own head. Of course the cliché handbook is going to make the killer have a childish side inside his head that is tortured by a mental dark past. You'd think something that obviously wishes to be different from normal Hollywood would have thought of something, you know, different . . .In the end, I see no reason anyone would want to see this movie unless they have a desire to study endless clichés.

Once you're inside the mind of someone, it goes into fantastical, sometimes surreal, territory. The cell of the title could be seen as the glass cage where a serial killer keeps and drowns his victims. However, I think the cell refers also to being trapped in one's own traumatic memories unable to escape. I enjoyed this film and found it quite stimulating (especially the visuals).There were scenes I had never seen before that were certainly helped a lot by amazing (sometimes over-the-top) costumes, make-up and hair. Despite being a killer, his mindscape was darkly imaginative instead of being realistically gritty (with exceptions). Of particular note were the fractioning horse scene and simply the killer walking down from his ""throne"" with the long trail. Most people will remember this film because of the visuals. However, I found the premise of going into a serial killer's mind singularly fascinating. The how and why I leave for you to discover but let's just say the manhunt aspect is over pretty quickly (something rarely seen but plot convenient) to change into a rescue operation.The serial killer himself was a rather creepy, menacing and tormented man-child played very well by an unrecognizable Vincent D'Onofrio. The killer himself is interesting and has an original modus operandi. Despite his atrocious acts, there's an attempt to try to understand him by showing us parts of his past and him as a child in his mindscape. It makes the viewer somewhat torn between sympathy towards the child and foreboding at his adult self. Jennifer Lopez was very good at showing empathy, not so much at being scared. Vince Vaughn was surprising in a dead-serious FBI agent role. Speaking of scares, the whole aspect of being stuck in that glass cell, especially in the second half, didn't quite work emotionally for me. The actress in it certainly tried her best to show distress, but I was personally more interested into going back to the mindscape.I found everything that happened to the child, and the way the bleached victims looked, way more chilling. Praise to the director on not being overtly graphic letting our imagination fill in the gaps. I think Tarsem is a director in the line of Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam to watch out for because he shows much talent and vision. The Cell defies the expectations of your standard serial killer movie and dazzles with unsettling imagery that I would call original except that several are borrowed from late 20th century artists.

I feel that ""Jacob's Ladder"" was an atmospheric and spiritual masterpiece worth seeing, but I can't imagine why anybody would actually want to see ""The Cell.""  I can't say that I was entertained in ANY WAY by this film, and in order for a movie to be worth something there must be SOME reason to pay the money, walk into the theater, and give 2 hours of time and attention.

Also, the musical score was absolutely, horrendously bad (yes, I pay attention to film scores).  Anyway, I don't have much more to say, because this one will be quickly and thankfully forgotten.  It gave me a stomach ache and brought down my whole week.  6/10.",The Cell
101,basrutten,"Utterly pointless, boring, and unbelievable",2,19 September 2003,"While this movie had a potentially interesting story behind it, it fails to do anything even remotely worthwhile with it. There are plenty of beautiful sceneries and lovely costumes, but that's really it. This movie is so pointless it hurts.First of all, they should have never cast Jennifer Lopez in this. On the one hand, you might say that the role is perfect for her since all she has to do is walk around in fancy dresses and look pretty, which is all OK (I mean, there are worse things to look at), but when you realize that she's supposed to be a scientist it all just falls apart..the whole idea of her playing somebody that actually uses her brain is just too ludicrous.
Then, there's the story, or lack thereof. It starts of as a standard serial killer movie, but then we get the novelty of going into the criminal's mind. Which is all great, if it weren't for the fact that the way that the kidnapped girl is eventually found has next to nothing to do with what happens in the criminal's mind, and is in fact so obvious that you wonder how they could have overlooked it in the first place. This basically makes the entire part in the criminal's mind rather pointless, if you ask me.
This impression is further strenghtened by the fact that the ""mind"" scenes are little more than a series of loosely tacked together sequences of Jennifer running around in increasingly bombastic dresses, with some unexpected pieces of gore thrown in for good (?) measure. Some of the gore was so over the top that I couldn't help but laugh...the scene where a horse gets split into pieces by falling glass blades was so bizarre that I burst into laughter rather than feel disgusted as I probably should have. The fact that I laughing rather than was shocked should give a nice indication of how far this movies misses its mark: the supposedly scare parts are funny, the supposedly exciting parts are predictable and the supposedly entertaining parts are boring in the extreme.  ""The Cell"" is a prime example of somebody having a nice idea for a movie, then screwing it all up in the worst possible way by doing just about everything wrong: wrong cast, wrong direction, wrong pacing, wrong plot. etc. Painfully boring and frustrating to watch1/2 out of **** stars",The Cell
102,Shiva-11,At least the effects are great,7,18 August 2000,"The Cell: Serial killers are a terrifying breed - unlike ""regular"" murderers motivated by passion, or occasionally money, there is never a simple motive for their crimes, which makes them difficult to catch.   The FBI has a special group whose sole job is to track down these monsters:  part cop, part psychologist, part psychic, they use sophisticated diagnostic tools to determine who these killer might be (age, race, etc) and why they kill. When a notorious predator falls into a coma agents desperately try to revive him to find where he is holding his latest victim.  With time running out, they enlist the aid of a child therapist who, using a new technology, literally steps into the mind of the serial killer, and embarks on a terrifying journey.I read several advance reviews that call this movie a fusion of  ""The Matrix"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"".   That annoys me: although the film is about a serial killer, and a missing victim, the similarities end there. ""Silence"" boasted a tight, well-written script, with fleshed out characters, complex relationships and a composite of several real life serial killers (they don't hand out five Oscars on a whim).  Likewise, ""The Matrix"" connection is tenuous at best - its clever, unique plot was bolstered and not completely overwhelmed by  - I hate to use the phrase because it sounds so cliched - its groundbreaking special effects.
 ""The Cell's"" plot is a thin veneer whose sole purpose is to stitch together the numerous digital sequences.  It is haphazardly constructed, inconsistent and at times confusing.  The characters are essentially shadows with minimal dialogue - is there any particular reason that Ms. Lopez whispers throughout the entire film? It seems like a cheap Marilyn Monroe imitation. Vincent D'Onofrio is the only person who gives an above average performance and given the state of his character, the bulk of it is physical. Obviously, that means I didn't enjoy the movie.  Not necessarily.From the opening sequence, the viewer is immersed in an amazing visual spectacle that fluctuates between stunning beauty, frightening decay and utter confusion.   The initial foray into the killer's mind is especially daring and disturbing, definitely one of the most innovative artistic sequences I've seen on film - if Picasso, Warhol and Dali collaborated on a digital imaging project, they would create something like this. Whenever the characters were in the fantasy realm I was totally engrossed whether I was being treated to a warped glass menagerie, sadomasochistic nightmare or bizarre passion play.  Unfortunately, they always returned to lackluster reality, which in this instance is particularly banal.  This could have been a great movie -  as it is, it's still worth the price of admission for the stunning imagery.",The Cell
103,drunken_munki,"Visually interesting, but pretty generic in the end",6,7 October 2020,"I was checking the review score and was a bit puzzled at first why it seemed low. But after completing a watch of this movie, it seems fair enough.The initial concept was interesting and got me hooked in. The serial killer was scary and was a good antagonist for the film. The problem is that there was no real protagonist in this film; it sets up Jenifer Lopez's character to be the protagonist, but then Vince Vaighn turns up as the restless FBI agent trying to catch his man... and he steals the show away.Vaughn wasn't even that special, but he showed up and made miss Lopez look very weak as an actor, I'm sad to report. Anyway, there was a boy who was trapped inside a coma and the scientists created a machine to access his mind in a dream-like world. This technology is used to access the killer's mind after he is 'caught' in an anti-climactic scene. In any case, a girl is trapped somewhere and will drown after a while if she is not found.Now that is it, that's the plot. The rest of the film is filled with the dream world of the killer's twisted mind. Some of it is creepy and well shot, some is random, some is comically rubbish -- particularly the clown like costumes, which I hated.So that is why this is so mixed, the horror aspect was let down by comic-like representation of evil and scary material. As if we were 10 years old or so. The script should have been better written here, because the initial set up was good and the serial killer was already scary enough. I mean, we're all seen 'Seven' right? The blueprint was already there.Overall it was worth a watch as a good movie, but not that memorable or interesting towards the end.6/10.",The Cell
104,Brogan,Silence of the Dreamscape.,7,30 August 2000,"This film reminded me of two thrillers put together into one film. The Oscar winning SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and the cult classic DREAMSCAPE, and put the two films together and you've got THE CELL. And one thing about THE CELL is that is has some of the most spectacular production designs since SLEEPY HOLLOW. THE CELL has a serial killer, Carl Stargher (Vincent D' Onofrio) a man who kidnaps young women and places them in a ""cell"" of sorts where as the hours go on, the glass cell fills with water until his victims drown to death.  He then dumps their bodies and makes them up to look like porcelin dolls. Enter FBI agents Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) who are on the trail of Carl.  They do find Carl, however he is unconscious and it's a matter of time before Carl's latest victim downs in his cage.  So they are suggested a new scientific discovery, where a group of scientist are helping giving people therapy, they enter the troubled person's mind, through their dreams.  And the only way the agents can know about the victim's whereabouts is by entering into Carl's mind.  Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a therapist who is the kindest and gentlest person who can communicate with people better than anyone else.  Catharine is a expert into traveling into other people's minds, so going into the mind of Carl will be a experience into hell that Catharine would never expect. There are some good points and bad points about THE CELL. The good points, THE SET DESIGNS!!!!!  WOW!!!  They are rather well done, a lot of imagination and creativity went into making this film.  I really enjoyed how things seem real or surreal, and how entering another person's nightmares can be scary for the guest just as much as it is for the resident.  I also liked how the movie was in a good pacing.  It can be very suspensful and tense in some scenes and it does take it's time to slow down to catch it's breath. Then the acting is also good.  I always enjoy Jennifer Lopez in SELENA and OUT OF SIGHT, and she did win me over with THE CELL.  Also giving a good performance is Vince Vaughn as the FBI agent who suffers his own nightmares, and Vincent D'Onofrio as the sadistic killer. Then there is the bad points.  The plot does seem muddled and thin at times.  There are scenes where you think that the movie is going to be leading to, then it turns out to be a weak sub-plot.  And with it's mixture of SE7EN and DREAMSCAPE it isn't that original, with the exception of the style of the dreams.  And there are some really disturbing scenes to watch, I mean so disturbing that you will probably be turning green like I did. One of the most horrific scenes is what the Vincent D'Onofrio's character has on his back, and what he likes to do after killing his victims. But I did count more plus points than negative points for this film, so I enjoyed it.  First time film director Tarsem Singh (who directed the symbolic R.E.M. video ""Losing My Religion"") does show the same style of symbolism and images in this film as he did in his music videos.  And it does have some scenes that still can't leave my mind after watching it. It does have a dark and creepy mood to it, and then again, this is a terrifying thriller that works out pretty well.  **** (out of five)",The Cell

Forever many people will be interested in these theme that they enter someone's mental world and see his personal core. What is human mentality built by? I'm curious it strongly.

108,rhinocerosfive-1,cancerous,4,20 November 2007,"I probably would have enjoyed this if I'd seen it in a damp cellar with a bunch of guys in overcoats. But I saw CELL at a Sunday matinée in Canoga Park, or some other garden of urban blight, in a theater full of little children - I mean ten year old children, five year old children, whole families of children, at least fifty altogether. In some cases the parents were in attendance. I knew that I was in the presence of a universal sin, a thing that should not be. To my shame I did not chase everyone out and set fire to the building.The design elements are spectacularly rendered. Its scenes of sexual violence and perversion are among the most effectively pornographic in the whole torture genre, far beyond the abilities of a James Wan or, pardon the expression, a Marcus Nispel. But maybe because it is better made, and more generally appealing, this film is even more of an abomination upon the earth.Movies like this and SE7EN, by their successful blend of style and puerility, allow SAW and the snuff remakes of good movies by Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper to ride the coattails of respectability right into the multiplex. The development strikes me as not a particularly good one. Watch this alone, and masturbate to it in the dark if you must satisfy your lust for human suffering. But don't spread your disease to the mall, where children indulge in the time-honored pastime of sneaking into the rated R stuff. Let them transgress enough to see some sex, but not the pornography of wounds.I am not for censorship. I am for responsibility. Make this movie, show this movie, but show it to adults. We used to give an X to adult movies, and this must be at least as bad for a kid as CLOCKWORK ORANGE or MIDNIGHT COWBOY. The science of early trauma on personality development is irrefutable. If you sell a product this dangerous, and you're not sure whether the distributor's behaving ethically, go find out or reap the consequences: a generation who sees sadism and entertainment as synonymous concepts.So much for morality. Beyond the pale of good and evil, this movie simply sucks whenever it goes outside somebody's head.

The beginning has a surreal feel to it. Miss Lopez has a gift of being able to go inside the mind of traumatised kids to help them.Meanwhile, there is a deranged killer at large named Carl Stargher. This guy is really disturbed. He puts women in a glass cell, and fills it up with water, slowly (it takes forty hours to fill). Then when they are dead, he covers them in bleach and places them on a table. Then he suspends himself above the body via hooks embedded in his skin, and masturbates.When Stargher falls into a coma, Miss Lopez is asked to go inside his mind to discover the location of a victim. The following scenes are where the film excels. Inside Stargher's mind are a collection of spectacular surreal images;  and also a psychedelic trip, when a FBI agent enters the killers mind.These scenes make the film worthwhile, and another positive is ultra sexy Jennifer Lopez; but somehow the film doesn't quite fulfil.

110,BigGuy,"Good visuals, but that's about it",2,21 August 2000,"The Cell is little more than a number of extended MTV music videos strung together with bits and pieces of a plot in between.  As a matter of fact, I think some of them were directly from some music videos.  Well some of the scenes are more out of a photography shoot and some are even quite stunning. But there is much more to a movie than visuals.The underlying idea is being able to enter people's minds to help them is stolen from Dreamscape.  In Dreamscape it was to help with nightmares in The Cell it is to help bring someone out of a coma.  They even stole the idea that it might be possible to die in a dream from psycho-somatic effects.The story is that the technology must be used to save a girl who has a very limited time to live.  To do this there is a battle of wills and psyche between the sick monster guy and the trained psychologist.  Sounds a lot like Silence of the Lambs.  Although Silence of the Lambs was incredibly better thought out and executed.My advice is to take the eight dollars for the movie, buy some NyQuil, and rent Dreamscape and silence of the lambs.  Drink the whole bottle of NyQuil watch the movies and some MTV (a couple of Marilyn Manson/Nine Inch Nails videos with a brief REM losing my religion interlude between them, then one of the super fluffy pastel videos with stuff floating around) and then wait for the crash as the NyQuil wears off.  The cost is the same in both cases and if you choose the non-""The Cell"" option you will get the added bonus of seeing at least one good movie.  Oh and I am not alone.

I not only give kudos to the the director for his idea of bringing the film to the screen, but the writer for getting the director to see his vision. This is a film that I'm, personally, not into, but I like Lopez and I'm a big fan of hers, so, granted it took me over eight years to sit down and watch it, I did it.

The overall look of the film is astounding:  Ranging from absolute stark desolation to rich and verdant lushness.The film is neither as frightening nor as gory as some would have you believe  rather the gore and thrill aspects are required by the plot, the visuals, and the story.The things you see are stunning  unfortunately if you have seen the television commercials you have seen most of the best.From audience reaction I am surprised that for some people this may not be an easy film to watch; but I was intrigued by nearly every moment of it.One technological aspect that I truly enjoyed was the sound of the film  NOT the music or soundtrack  but the way everyday sounds were used to accentuate key moments in the story.The costumes by Ieko Ishioka -- when in the out-of-body' sequences -- were less costume and more sculpture.Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn were completely believable in their roles as the serial killer in a coma and the FBI agent looking for his current victim.This film seemed to be billed as a horror flick but it turned out to be a mental thriller.Not a film for everyone  but if you want to see a Sci-Fi/Thriller/Horror flick with an exotic visual style this IS your film to see.",The Cell

What matters is the sensory experience. Pretty pictures, good music - those are the things that make or break the movie.'The Cell' is strong on the visuals. Tarsem Singh is a master of production design: he brings to life visions, paintings, dreams. 'The Cell' has a wide array of color, exuberant costumes, imaginative settings, unsettling situations.

The surreal sequences present themselves as a look inside a serial killer's twisted psyche, okay, so they're loaded with symbolism, but it rings somehow untrue, like it's too grandiose to be somebody's mind, especially somebody with no artistic ambitions or interests.

Studying surrealism, I could catch a ton of references, from Dali, Escher, Magritte, Devaux, Bellmer... dolls, staircases, horses, eyes, down the rabbit hole we go.Personal PRO:
What I liked were some methods in dream-like, not-logical storytelling: like a montage that features objects, people etc that were introduced the shot before but then change it up. Like elongating / changing a room in the dream world (like J-Lo sitting in the cupboard where the boy locked here and then the room changes into a larger bathroom in the next, opposite shot. I also liked the exotic costumes in the dream-world and some of the scenery-designs (like the ancient market hall or the Tarkowsky-like endless mine field, an Escher-esque stair case). It was a pleasure to look at how they introduce the viewer to the dream world. Sure, it is sometimes 'in your face' and way too obvious, but analyzing it as methods was fun (since I am interested in HOW to make surreal films).CON(s):
I must say: I have seen some things and this film was a tad - too much... for my personal taste. Sure, it had rich elements and scenes, I do enjoy watching them, they are like fireworks - but a not so well choreographed one that just wants to go BOOM BOOM.The way too sexed-up dolls and the horrifying elements (like jump scares, blood and splatter, cresecendoing violin music to increase tension,...) were way too much and - in my point of view - unnecessary. Surreal would have worked without that explicit material and jump-scares. Look at Lynch. Look at Jarmusch. Look!The story itself is simple, the characters quite transparent and of course, there is a happy ending... The performances were okay, perfectly fittet for the adventure, yep. J-Lo had to have her Hollywood ending to keep her Persona up. This is a nice blockbuster, but for sure not an arthouse gem.FAZIT:

Carl Starger, serial killer full time, likes to kidnap beautiful women, take them to his ware house, submit them to several necrophagus rituals to transform into dolls so later he can worship them and throw them dead in driveways.

124,wandereramor,Remarkably not awful,7,15 July 2012,"The Cell is a weird, quickly-forgotten movie from the post-Matrix wave of trippy science fiction starring Jennifer Loepz and (a remarkably skinny) Vince Vaughn of all people. In essence, it's CSI by way of Paprika, with Lopez's character entering the dreamscape of a criminal to try and find his latest victim.It's in these dream sequences that the film really signs. An assortment of horrific images, adapted surrealist art, and jumbled-up psychoanalysis produces a number of segments that are genuinely creepy and creative. It raises the same questions about dream and reality as any number of other films, but what makes The Cell remarkable is the lack of clear answers it gives. In the end we never have a single explanation for why our killer does what he does -- we get some hints at a biological deformity, an abusive childhood, and a strange religious belief system, but none of them are established as a clear answer. The meaning of the dream sequences are similar -- they're cinema that begs for explication, and I always love that.The dream sequences alone make the film worth watching, which is good because other than that there isn't much there. The plot outside of the science-fictional element is a serviceable but generic cop thriller that spends way too much time getting to the point. Vaughn and Lopez are also woefully miscast, which is too bad as their characters really needed good actors to flesh out the hazy writing. There are plenty of cheesy moments and flaws, but I find myself liking the movie despite myself.

Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. The inside-the-mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning, all the leads perform adequately, the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing, but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me, as I had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before, not this fairly successful blending of serial-killer and special-effect-horror genre staples. Sometimes horrifying, often pretty, a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people, but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as.",The Cell

But when you take away the look, you're left with yet another serial-killer-with-a-highly-stylized-and-unlikely-pathology. I do find Jennifer Lopez to be more credible as a social worker turned psychic explorer than, oh, say something silly like Meg Ryan as a cardiac surgeon. And it features the very tall and handsome Vince Vaughn, which can't be a bad thing. I gave it 7 out of 10.",The Cell
127,IrisNo11,A Surrealistic Film That Cannot Be Ignored,10,25 August 2000,"""The Cell"":  A gory tale about a deranged serial killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) who suffers from the harsh memories of his childhood. His schizophrenic mood swings get worse as life goes on, and sadly, he turns to a life of crime.  When he kidnapps Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff), he hides her where no one can find her, leaving the FBI in a chaos.  Soon, FBI agent, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), and the FBI turn to psychotherapist Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who (with brand new and interesting technology) goes into Carl's twisted mind to see where he is hiding Julia.  There, she sees a much softer side to Carl, but not to mention - his vulgar, dark imagination.For me personally, ""The Cell"" was a blessing, because this year, I've seen A LOT of really sh*tty movies (""Scary Movie"" has been branded the number one worse movie I ever seen).  Even when I saw the commercials, I KNEW that I would enjoy this movie.  I didn't expect a few parts yet that's what movies offer unless the plot is pointless or one of those films that you say, ""Seen it before...*yawn*!""Watching this film was like looking at a painting of pure surrealism.  The images of Carl's ""dolls"" were battered with bruises, cuts, blood, needles, and pins that symbolize torture, anger, and pain.  When Catharine is in Carl's mind, you notice the heartache he's suffered from when he was a little boy.  He sees himself as a ruler of a monarch of fear and pain.  Some of the images reminded me of the Nine Inch Nails video, ""Closer"", and a painting by Salvadore Dali called ""I Dream of an Evening Dress"" (or something like that!).I couldn't take my eyes off of any of the scenes, because I was captured by the shear brilliance of this film.  It was NOTHING like I've seen in a film ever before!  Perhaps it's the best film in the new millenium! :)Just a minor warning:  Some of the bloody parts in this movie maybe too hot to handle for some viewers!!!  On the other hand, if you do have high tolerence for scenes such as that - ENJOY!!!",The Cell
128,thomvic,A beautiful nightmare.......,7,11 October 2010,"I remember renting this at the video store in high school about 6 years ago and i didn't think much of this film. However, watching it again recently, I do realise how much this film conveys beauty and darkness into one, thus making it a really fascinating, if at times slow, ride.Essentially the plot is about Jennifer Lopez, who plays Catherine, a psychologist who is able to enter the minds of her patients through a new technology available, where she goes into the patient's mind and talks to them etc etc. She is asked to enter the mind of a serial killer in order to know where he has kept his latest victim who will soon drown. The only problem is that obviously entering a mind like that holds big risks, as she enters the unknown, and she may never get out....Jennifer Lopez gives a reasonably good performance and is definitely watchable. Essentially the plot is a lot like Silence of the Lambs, though you get to know more about the killer, who you often feel sorry for. This film sort of gives reasons for why someone can become crazy, and this film is more sympathetic to the killer.The visuals in this are fantastic and you can only marvel at the creativity. Though it does feel that this is sometimes more for show than heart, and I did feel that the scenes in the serial killer's mind did go a bit slow sometimes. I mean, Catherine is working on a clock and time basis - the victim doesn't have much time so I did think that she could have done it a bit faster, but then obviously she has to go easy and slowly with the killer or it will blow up so it was acceptable.This is essentially a Silence of the Lambs with added Science Fiction thrown in to make it seem more unique. The main problem with the film is that the characters aren't particularly interesting, despite the fact that they could have very well been. Vince Vaughn is also pretty bland in his role as the detective.This is more a thriller than horror, as some people might think it is horror, but I wouldn't recommend watching this at night for the first time since you won't know what is in store. After that, it should be fine.",The Cell
129,InaneSwine,Silly but somewhat entertaining,7,11 April 2006,"In this silly but somewhat entertaining sci-fi thriller, Jennifer Lopez plays a scientist who, using modern technology, can literally enter the mind of another person. She is given the dubious task of entering the twisted mind of psychopath Vincent D'Onofrio, to track down his next victim.A large portion of the film is made up of abstract images that J-Lo witnesses as she travels deeper and deeper into the mind of D'Onofrio, and the rest of the film is made of constant cutbacks to Vince Vaughn loping around, trying to find the ""cell"" in which the psycho's next victim is kept. The film seems to be a pointless exercise in style over content. Nevertheless, the film does move at quite an impressive pace, despite the fact that its point is rather distant.",The Cell
130,rmarkd,Visuals and little else,5,5 September 2000,"Just as the summary above, this movie is all about some nice visuals, some disturbing scenes and one great idea executed badly. The story failed, the ending was the kind you're embarassed to watch. Parts lagged, characters were flatter than a just ironed shirt, and the section marked ""story"" must have been lost in movie production.As a visual exercise it's awesome, but I need more than that from a movie.
What's surprising is the high praise from Roger Ebert, totally forgetting the idea of a critic which is to concentrate on characters and plot, and less on visuals. It's nice to be ""ooohed"" and ""ahhed"", but if that's all there is, you're left with little.This movie is worth seeing only because you won't believe me and that some of you, for some god only knows reason, will actually enjoy this thing.-Mark",The Cell
131,hippiedj,"An engaging experience but not original, it's inspired heavily by other films.",7,12 February 2001,"First things first: yes, I enjoyed The Cell immensely.  Every element worked well and you will definitely be riveted to the screen for the entire length of the film.  HOWEVER, here's where I need to try to get you guys (like Ebert) who thought this was the most original thing they've seen in ages.The plot? Basically a cross between Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs. The visuals? Basically an extended version of Madonna's music video ""Bedtime Stories."" Also, any Terry Gilliam film has done this, and the visions of Hell in What Dreams May Come came pretty close too. And the bodies hanging by wires, say, remember a film from 1978 called Coma?  The idea of going into a person's mind was done on one of those sindicated sci-fi series too... Now I'll admit you combine these elements of other films and with The Cell you have a good film in itself.  It is a film to recommend, and be a part of your collection.  Just remember that this film is an homage to other films and not exceptionally original on its own standing.So, with that in mind, ENJOY!  I did, and was satisfied after it was over and left with a smile on my face.  I think of it as a tribute film in a way, taking nods to other great endeavors and to make a very good film from others and pull it off is some task indeed.  Good work to those involved in this project.  I must admit I was so happy they didn't have Ms. Lopez sing a theme song!",The Cell

The DVD features some interesting special features, most notably the Brain Map and Empathy Test (the deleted scenes and director's commentary are not very notable at all).JH",The Cell
133,chthon2,"Visually Stunning, Standard Plot",7,24 January 2003,"An FBI Agent (Vince Vaughn) has been tracking down a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, in a great performance) who kidnaps women and drowns them in a cell in the basement of an abandoned farmhouse he was paid to dismantle. But when the feds find him, he has gone into a coma. But technology that allows social workers to enter patients minds may be the key to finding out where his latest victim is before the cell drowns her. Enter a gifted psychologist (Jennifer Lopez, the film's lead) who mainly works with traumatized children.  Her initial job is to go in, discover where the victim is, and get out.  But when she discovers that the killer has a tortured inner child, she tries to get emotionally involved, an act which could destroy her mentally. This is, however, Tarsem's film.  If India has more directors like this, then it's a shame we don't see more films from that country.  There is some CGI, but this is mostly makeup and set work; computers are kept to a minimum.  Tarsem shows us a startling portrayal of a killer's mind, which seems very believable.  Mark Protosevich wrote a so-so script, which isn't a bad thing; it just means that when you see this movie, there's three things you should be paying attention to.  The first is Tarsem's visuals.  The second is how the characters interact with the environment. The third, one of my favorite's, is the performance by Vincent D'Onofrio. I swear, this man is a genius, even though he is overshadowed by Tarsem's work.  This is so different from his role on Law & Order: Criminal Intent, it's just amazing how he can move from role to role.  On another note, did anyone notice the similarity between the two Vince's?  I mean, they're both tall, 300 pound gorillas with bad posture.  If you saw one of them from behind, you probably couldn't tell who it is. Overall, worth renting.  And the DVD is much better than the edited version.",The Cell

135,Captain Ed,"Not as bad as I heard, but not very good either -- spoilers!",5,11 July 2001,"The advance word on this movie was that you could hear the giant sucking sound for miles, and so I skipped this one in the theaters.  Too bad -- and I should really know better -- because it would have been nice to see some of the visual effects done on a large screen.That was the best part of the film; the visual presentation, the vivid colors, the disturbing montages.  The director has an eye for the art of filmmaking, and you can expect to see more from him in the future. However, I would encourage him on his next venture to find a better script and spend some time getting actors who can make us believe.The story, as has been commented previously, ""borrows"" heavily from Silence of the Lambs and somewhat less so from The Matrix.  In science fiction, you have to be prepared to accept at least one improbable construct.  In this film, that would be the mind-meld machine that Jennifer Lopez uses to connect to comatose patients.  However, we're also supposed to accept that Vincent D'Onofrio's psychopath can afford to engineer, build, and maintain a drowning cell, bleach bath, permanent hooks all over his body and the automated hoist that they use to suspend him, etc etc etc.  The super-villain is a plausible concept if you establish the particulars: fabulously wealthy, incredibly intelligent, something along those lines. D'Onofrio's character has none of those resources to call on.D'Onofrio, by the way, gives the best performance of the film, but it's that kind of role.  Lopez and Vaughan seem to be sleepwalking (pun intended) through theirs.  Especially Lopez; she's about as convincing as Madonna, or slightly better than Sofia Coppola in Godfather 3.  The script doesn't help; there's precious little character development for anyone except D'Onofrio, and Vaughan alludes to some abuse in his background, which you expect to be revealed when he injects himself into the mind-meld process, but it is never mentioned again.  His haunted look is way over the top (I kept wishing someone would give him a Tylenol 3 and a cot).  There's a quick mention of Lopez having a brother who died in a coma, but it's buried under music and even with headphones I couldn't understand what exactly was said.--spoiler--And while the dream sequences were visually stunning, they didn't seem to make much sense.  Why are all dreams made out to be Salvador Dali-esque flights of fancy?  I could understand that when we were in the killer's twisted mind, but why is there no difference between there and Lopez's mind, or the comatose child in the beginning?  Also, the religious imagery (Lopez as the Madonna -- is that real-life wish-fulfillment for her musical career?) towards the end is just silly.  It gets patently objectionable when she finishes off child-Carl.  Not to mention that we are once again given the all-too familiar powerless, trapped victim, not once but twice (through video replay), who can do nothing much but simper and scream. Ugh.It's worth a look, just for the artwork and the grandeur of the first couple of scenes within Carl's mind.  I would hesitate to expect much more than that.",The Cell
136,DoctorSkyTower,WHAT A STUPID FLICK!,3,21 January 2001,"Puke.That's how I felt after watching this trash. I spent 1/4 of the time counting how many people walked out of the theater, and believe me, quite a few did! However I stayed, just so I could endure the (predictable) ending, and of course, write my review!Story revolves around Ms Lopez being able to enter the subconscious memory of comatose patients via a fancy futuristic mind-gizmo. A serial killer has a 'viral schizophrenic' attack (whatever that means!!) and ends up in a coma. It's up to her to get into his mind and find the whereabouts of his last victim before she dies.WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! There are disturbing sexual images, horrific scenes of death, and a gruesome torture scene that's sure to make you hurl into your popcorn. I felt like I was watching a 2 hour long Marilyn Manson MTV video. Most of the flick was depressing and ugly. Anything beautiful is violently mutilated. We see a horse being sliced into sections, and each section is anatomically presented, still beating and alive. (So that's what goes on in a serial killer's mind!)Ms Lopez is shown as a sort of patron saint, her mind-world is pure and angelic. I had a hard time accepting this one. Suspension of disbelief is required here! And what was up with her husky, barely audible whisper? She also can't act! There are many comments saying how beautiful this flick is. There is nothing beautiful about this flick, period. What it does is bring out the lowest common denominator in the human psyche. This junk will definitely appeal to those who have sick fantasies about corpses.CONCLUSION? If you want to watch a really scary, gruesome visual movie, watch Se7en instead.

137,Michael Kenmore,Stylish but pretentious and empty,2,27 March 2001,"How The Cell is so highly regarded by critics and audience alike is beyond me. It's just yet another empty, formulaic serial killer movie. Hey Hollywood producers, we're sick and tired of serial killer movies as of late now! Somebody needs to put an end to this stupid movie plot device trend. Serial killer movies are so cliched and stereotypical.Haven't we seen the plot in The Cell before? It's Silence of the Lamb meets Se7en with Dreamscape thrown in. The Cell proves the theory that style over substance matters more than plausible plot and character development.The Cell is littered with the repulsive imagery of violence, torture, sadism and gore. This demonstrates the joke that is the MPAA. Why rate more powerful but equally (or less) graphic Requiem for a Dream a NC-17 while The Cell gets the favor of an R rating? I know the parents dragged small children to see the movie, only to scream and cry because the movie is nightmarish and frightening. This borders on child abuse. MPAA board members and Jack Valenti, wake up and get the grip on reality! You should be forced to watch this movie a few times and know the difference!The Cell is a pretentious piece of crap that pretends to know the right from wrong. There's not a single credible acting in the movie, not even Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn. Some certain parts are intentionally written and designed to repulse us, including the exaggerated and graphic description of child sexual abuse coupled with gruesome murder to hammer home a moral lesson. There are pretty good visuals, but that's not good enough to redeem the repugnant nature of this film that pass itself as a mainstream entertainment masquerading as art with moral pretension.It's pathetic pretentious and rotten movies like The Cell become box office hits because of moviegoers' inability to distinguish good movies from garbage, so expect Hollywood to churn out more formulaic serial killer thriller movies in the future.",The Cell
138,ernesti,Just another below average thriller with scifi and bucketful of clichés,2,21 October 2012,"I had seen some fragments of this movie before but now that i managed to almost watch it completely i have to admit that it's a huge mess of a movie. I can understand the surreal dream sequences but they just don't work very well in my opinion. The special effects look digital, bland and quite cheap to me and they'd have worked better with different kind of lighting. Pacing could have been slower to make the film more suspenseful.I found Lopez not to be the best choice to play the role of the main character. There is very little character development and most of the characters in this movie are left one dimensional. Even the bad guy didn't seem to have much depth in his character. He just is the enemy with a troubled childhood and that makes him evil. (Ah, really that's so original *sigh*.) I rarely like scifi elements in a movie and this time it's not an exception. I just hated the whole idea of having a device that has the ability to go into one's mind. If that's combined with a bucketful of clichés presented in this movie it makes a really bad mess with no sense of style.The movie takes itself too seriously and that's the major part of the problem. When a movie has most of its elements that are over the top not believable at all then why should it be so serious. It could just as well be a comedy after seeing the first scene with the bad guy and his victim. It just was so unbelievably over the top silly and disgusting that it can't be taken seriously. There never was an explanation for why he ever became so super evil, so it must have been his childhood.I'm a fan of bad movies but this time i had no idea what to think of this. I'm not very picky but this movie was just disappointing. I'm glad that i never paid anything to see it.In short this movie tries very hard to be artfully surreal but manages to be so over the top that it's very hard to to take it as a serious movie. There isn't much of plot twists in this movie, the bad guy is revealed too early on and the end resolution is fortunate for everyone.It's hard to recommend this movie to anyone so i can just assume that people who like scifi and bad taste might even like it.",The Cell

The cell really had no point,i still figure what it was on about!And the scenes were done poorly,every minute the scenes would change,leaving no logical sense.

140,Anyanwu,Same story with nothing really that much different than anything else.,5,6 September 2000,"I saw The Cell on opening day and I must say since I have not read any of the other reviews I was let down. The story is nothing that we have not seen before in the past. The one plus of the film was, as everyone might say, was the visuals. But, there were not much of them. The film kept going back and forth from the inner non-real world to the real world. It should have stayed in the non real world. Let me put it quickly, from one who is really ""jonesing"" for something different The Cell would have been much more interesting if the following were implemented. 1)Lopez should have been the bad ""guy-girl"". She should have been in Vincent D's place. Lopez would have been cool in this way if not for her voice alone. Lopez is sweet and her voice would have thrown people because of its sweetness masking an evil person/demon killer. Dynamics are enhanced. Sweetness going to Evil Demon is much more stressful. Also, the costumes and makeup would have been so much more interesting on her i.e. black makeup in sword scene. 2)The film should have located itself in the non real world for most of the film-that's where all the interesting s**t was happening. 3) By doing #2 the visual imagery that Tarsem was going after would have been increased and a lot more dynamic. The visuals were cool but we did not get to see them enough. I ask all who have seen the movie, was it not the moment we see Ms Olympia Kim Chivesky-whatever move toward Lopez and swoop her up the ooh aah high point of the movie? That's the s**t. People are overwhelmed by those things that they believe just can't be. And seeing Kim w/the lighting the way it was, handle Lopez in that quick edit was unsettling. That scene was a jar dropper and it is those kinds of scenes that would have made The Cell something that it was selling itself as; a truly visual thriller.",The Cell
141,darkjosh,Who cared about the actors?,6,25 August 2000,"Apparently, not even the director did.  Jennifer Lopez shows her acting skills are minimal, and Vince Vaughn, whom I had confidence might become better as he went along in his craft, here looks hung-over, disinterested, and generally tired and bored.SPOILERS The visuals are very disturbing and well-executed.  One that is sure to become an instant classic is the cut-up horse, in which we see the its still pumping and working guts.  Original, shocking, and memorable.
All in all, however, the film does not really make you care about any one of the characters, including Jennifer Lopez as a dope-smoking child psychologist; Vince Vaughn as a tired FBI agent in a bad suit and tie; and Vincent D'Onofrio as the sick sadistic, yet somehow generic, killer.
Don't go to this film expecting a fantastic thrill ride or a beautifully written and acted film.  See it for what it is: a dark, disturbing, visceral, and purely visual film whose only sign of being Hollywood-ized is its three ""major"" stars.6 out of 10.",The Cell
142,stebird,Your subconscious is our reality,9,13 August 2017,"A visual treat with a strong and intriguing story, that would be the best way to describe The Cell.It's like a precursor to Inception, whereby you venture into the subjects mind to observe and report and to intervene with the person's subconscious , suggestions can be implanted into the subjects mind and questions can be answered too. Visually the film was grade A, crisp, clean focused shots dominated the film and I liked some of the scenes where layers of deep colour were framed perfectly, like during the opening segment where Catherine was in the little boy she was working with's mind, the top layer was deep blue sky, underneath was strong yellow representing sand and the dark silhouette of Catherine framed perfectly in the centre of the shot, the film has many examples such as this, making the overall presentation very artistic. Vince Vaughn was still finding his feet in Hollywood at the time, but showed some serious skill in The Cell, before he became a full time comic actor this was, and Jennifer Lopez showed that she had genuine acting talent and wasn't solely a singer..., the back up cast including the underrated Dean Norris were excellent and fleshed the film out well. Simple, easy to follow science-fiction, this is what happens when science-fiction is done right; one of the best films from the year 2000, a strange year for Hollywood, the final year before the 21st century kicked in and major changes swept across the landscape.",The Cell

It's touching and funny and, while the imagery is the meat of the film, there is a strong storyline and characters that engage and create sympathy in the viewer. I am glad I saw it before I viewed ""The Cell"". Otherwise I would never have gone. I would have read that Singh was involved and said, ""isn't that they guy who did The Cell? No f'n way."" This film is such a vapid mess of style sans substance, flat characters, insipid dialog, exposition ad nauseam and predictable hackneyed plot points, that any allure the imagery might have provided was lost in the mire. I started fast forwarding about 40 minutes in, and I am surprised that I made it that far. Sure enough, I found that you can skip 90% of the dialog and still follow the story. This was mostly digital masturbation. Had I not seen The Fall I would have suggested that Singh go back to music videos and stay there. But having seen it, I know he can do good films. This just isn't one of them. This is CSI for Adult Swim. You might enjoy it if you're stoned enough... but leave the sound off! Not even 'shrooms could save that dialog.",The Cell

It balances showing dark images in the killers mind, with terrible scenes of the killer's past. This movie certainly doesn't excuse murder, but it gives us more of an understanding of a killer's evil ways. The best part of this movie is it's visually stunning and original scenes inside the mind of a cerial killer. I wish there was less of everything outside the killer's mind and more inside in this movie, but what it has definetly in my mind serves up a decent flick.This movie is not for everyone. Some people will be turned off but some of it's suprisingly disturbing scenes, others won't like it because they have a lack of apreciation for originality as I noticed in many of the reviews.

I don't look to Jennifer Lopez getting any academy award nominations in the near future and everyone verged on below average.

154,samgiannn,"""The Cell"" is a Ferociously Original Thriller",6,14 July 2015,"The Cell is unlike a movie I've ever seen before. It's a mix of bizarre special effects, serial murders and fantasy that is far too uncommon in mainstream cinema. There's also the fact that this is a film with Jennifer Lopez that is actually good. The Cell is a sci-fi thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh with Jennifer Lopez in the lead. A social worker, Catherine Deane, is called to enter the mind of a serial killer who has fallen into a coma in order to find his next victim before she's killed. This guy can make Hannibal Lecter seem like small- time; he traps his female victims inside a cell that will slowly fill with water until it drowns them, then bleaches their skin after their dead so that they can be his own personal dolls. After entering the killer's mind, Catherine finds herself lost in his psyche and must find her way out, or else the killer will find her. The Cell has a lot of haunting imagery since it has to build an entire world inside someone's mind. Tarsem builds this world incredibly well and makes the viewer feel like they're trapped with Catherine in there. The serial killer plot itself is a little thin because a majority of the film takes place within the killer's mind, but the way the story is told is so original that most of the film's faults can be forgiven. If you want your average serial killer thriller told in an incredibly original and memorable way, The Cell will give you that and more.",The Cell

The little boy from 'Lizzie McGure'...I think his name is Jake Thomas...did a pretty good job.  Even though he only got about 3 or 4 words throughout the whole movie. The emotion on his face replaced the words.Even though some of the actors are decent, the movie is seriously lacking. Nothing in the movie came together to make sense.  There was also no character development.  The only character that we really got to know was the serial killer.  And I have to say that special effects do not qualify as acting.

Fincher, Jonze and Tarsem Singh all come from music videos. Fincher and Jonze might make the better movies as far as the storylines go, but The Cell is an undeniable proof that Singh has the best visual sense (and by this I'm in no way trashing Fincher's film's visuals). This film is a perfect collaboration between the director and everyone working beneath him. I mean the production design, the photography and especially the score (screw LOTR, this is clearly Howard Shore's best and most beautiful work to date).
Sure the story is old and has been done to death, but what makes The Cell special is that it manages to be original anyway. The headtrips are UNBELIEVABLE.

To the last detail, some were too graphic for words! And the torture he put his victim's through. Just as sadistic, as the rest of this appalling movie!

162,Zoopansick,Well it was weird,3,13 September 2004,"This is the type of movie that strikes me as being not very good but because of it's bizarre visuals will get some high praise from people on IMDb. Really there isn't much of a story here. The FBI is looking for a missing woman who was kidnapped by a deranged killer but is forced to ""go inside the killer's head"" and find out her whereabouts. Once inside his head Lopez basically wanders around the weird visual landscape and asks the various versions of the Killer where the girl is. She finds out that the serial killer was abused as a child (surprise!) and eventually, with the help of Vince Vaughn discovers the location of the girl. There really isn't much dialogue of note here, and the writing plays a back seat to the sets and costumes. In an illogical move Lopez invites the killer into her mind so she can help the ""boy"" trapped inside. It seems rather unnecessary as 1)nothing is real inside that world as they state several times 2)why not just put the man to death on the outside and cease all his brain activity? after all it would be a lot easier since he is stuck in a coma. 3)who cares?I didn't really give a rip about any of the characters as they are merely set pieces in this bizarre fantasy. Some people have touted how disturbing some of the images are here, and I guess from a technical perspective it is well done, but really if you find enjoyment in disturbing images then what does that say about yourself? It's not like there is any real insight given about serial killers here by going into his mind. We learn that his father is in a major way to blame for his actions, but guess what, hundreds of studies have already shown that parental abuse can lead to criminal behavior.In the end I wasn't very entertained with this movie, I didn't think there was much story and none of the characters were particularly interesting as they really were just 2d images in the background. The look of the film was intriguing to me at first, but after awhile it started to wear thin on me as it was all style and little substance. I think this movie would have worked better as a short film and could have done away with the entire kidnapped girl aspect of the movie. If you find disturbing entertaining then by all means rent this movie, but if are looking for something more then surrealist paintings brought to life then look elsewhere.Zoopansick",The Cell

I've seen this plot now with different scenery at least ten times. In this one they turn it into an extended avant-garde music video without the music.

165,Speechless,"Underrated, iconoclastic gem",9,20 November 2000,"The Cell isn't perfect, but it's definitely a much better movie than most of the other reviewers would have you believe.  I think most of the negative reactions are largely based on misunderstandings of what this movie seeks to achieve.People complain that the movie's fantastic imagery is too gory, too twisted, too disturbing, too misogynistic.  I have to ask-- what else would you expect to find inside the psyche of a man who butchers women in his spare time?There are a few story lulls.  But again, I think the critics who say the plot and characters are too thin are missing the point.  The story is just a clothesline for the incredible fantasy sequences, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Nobody complains about a lack of plot when they see a John Woo movie, where the story is only necessary to link gunfight and martial arts sequences together.  The same idea applies here--The Cell is more of a flow of images than a narrative, and that's just fine.  As for the complaint that the acting is bad, I can only reply that I thought the performances were perfectly sufficient.  Nothing Oscar-worthy, but they get the job done. Again, nobody ever complains about the bad acting in lots of other genre movies where the plot exists only for the sake of imagination and imagery. Sure, Mark Hamill's acting in the Star Wars films is pretty bad, but nobody cares except people who are missing the point.No, The Cell isn't the best movie ever made, but it isn't nearly as bad as most reviewers seem to think.

167,silviopellerani,"A good, original and useless video clip",5,30 December 2000,"The Indian American Tarsem Singh is well known in the video clip art world. This well directed film with high impact images is centered in a serial killer who is based in an industrial area with water tanks like aquarium and the victims are left into an empty tub which is filled in up to the final drowning. The problem raises when the last victim is being left in the tub and the serial killer, which meanwhile has been found, became in coma. The only way to save the victim's life is to experiment the recent scientific achievement of entering into the subconscious of the killer to get details of his traumas, solve it and hopefully obtain tools to know where the victim is hidden. The trip scenes from one body to another reminds the well achieved science fiction film ""Innerspace"" by Joe Dante. Film tries to be deep: dream images with dusty paths, the hiding-place is like a terror museum with puppets, the tub, the vital fluid and the holy water basin tries to explain the origin of the life flashbacking to the killer's infancy. The drowning of the victims is revealed partially in the trauma of the baptism. Some scenes are crude like the one where his body is suspended by chains fixed in the flesh. Images when the psychiatric operator (Jennifer Lopez) is ferried into the killer's body are like the best video clip ever seen. Colours are well marked but the result is a poor commercial film with beautiful images and a sensual Jennifer lopez, that does not explore further into the killer's mind and gets particularly benefit of the popularity of Jennifer Lopez and the ""serial killer's film wave"" oughting to be a blockbuster.Rating: 5/10",The Cell

Apparently a crime film, the movie is as original as controversial in opinions. Jennifer Lopez does a good job (but not for an Academy Award) and D'Onofrio rocks with his performance as the psycho-killer. But first, let me point out the plot a little bit.The film starts like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (you'll have to see it..), and then carries on with the typical story about the bad guy killer and the handsome good detective. Then, the film does a 180º turn and changes completely in a succession of surrealistic images in a strange atmosphere. And here is when the film reaches the top, showing to the audience incredible and unbelievable worlds as never seen.And this strange atmosphere gives the original point to The Cell, 'cause without it, the movie will be the same boring story of policeman, criminals and killers.

Anyway, setting aside all the stupidity from uncreative people commenting about this movie you will read on here, This is one of the best movies of the year, period.  It acts with a nightmarish theme, which causes most of the people to miss the whole point that it is not just the typical scary movies that have been coming out recently, rather the reality parts in the film and the dream sequences each being as scary as the other.  It goes to show you truth, and how some peoples morbid minds can attract as much hell as an nightmare could induce.  This film is much better than ""Silence Of The Lambs"", where as it goes beyond  just plain killings and actually into the killers mind, like a sort of playland.  The story was written with such creativity, kind of like what harsh message a poet would want to put across the screen, and the film is shot with such wild camera angles that it reminds you of Hitchcock.  Oh, yeah and the acting is good too (incase you were wondering, Lopez is exCELLent as well).  It is good to see movies with a more broader theme making their way into our generation, it goes to show you we may be allowed to view things a little bit deeper and a little bit further if we allow ourselves, wither it be nice or grim.

171,Sam_Gray,underwhelming in every possible way,4,23 August 2000,"There's a scene in The Cell, very early on, in which Jennifer Lopez is smoking a joint.  It only happens once, isn't mentioned again, and isn't relevant to the plot in any way.  It's as if director Tarsem Singh thought he could up Lopez's appeal to that valuable younger demographic if only he threw in some weed...along with a shot of Lopez's butt.  I'm part of that demographic, by the way, and I'm not at all impressed by this film.Now, let me be clear.  The issue here is not that I have any particular problem with drug use in movies.  I just think the scene sums up the entire film in general.  Got a thin, generic plot?  Throw in some marijuana and semi-nudity; the kids will love you for it.  What, the characters don't have anything interesting to say?  Better fill your movie with repetitive special effects instead.  Huh, no suspense in your suspense thriller?  Put some violence on the screen; they won't know the difference.Really, at some point, The Cell represents just about everything that's wrong with the Hollywood machine.  It has but three character focuses, yet all of them are about as generic as possible.  Lopez is a sexy but capable and good-hearted social worker, Vaughn is a by-the-numbers FBI guy, and D'Onofrio is a completely typical serial killer.  Not one of them much grows during the film.  Not one of them is interesting.And this is also one of those films that asks the viewer to accept every possible coincidence.  D'Onofrio has an ultra rare mental disease, an ultra rare dog, and an ultra rare killing machine.  I just find that to be a few too many ""1 in a million"" types of occurrences.  And don't expect impressive visuals to bear the burden, either.  Granted, what effects the film has are good.  But, after the first forty-five minutes or so, Sighn begins to repeat the same stock images over and over again. There's enough eye candy to fill a decent trailer but nothing more.And, perhaps the worst part about it all is that The Cell is just watchable enough that Hollywood will continue to churn out more movies with the same flaws.  As much as I hated it, I have to admit I wasn't bored during it. But I do regret paying $6.75 to see it.  Wait for video if you still have to see it.  4/10",The Cell
172,Psycho Mantis,A different experience,6,20 June 2001,"This is truly one of the most different movies I´ve seen this year, well during the whole new millennium actually! Musicvideo-director Tarsem Singh brings us a film which isn´t like anything else, although I wish they had given him a better script to work with.
Psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) have discovered a way to enter a persons mind with the help of supermodern technology. She does this to be able to help a little boy who´s in coma. This technique is soon shown to be very helpful for the FBI, led by the serial killer expert Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn). They have managed to catch one of the worst killers ever, Carl Stargher (Vincent D´Onofrio, in a terrific performance!) Unfortunately, Stargher is in a coma and soon his latest victim will meet a terrible death if the FBI doesn´t find her in time. So Catherine has to enter the killer´s mind, to discover his secrets. It will not be a safe trip, though. Tarsem Singh´s debut looks fantastic, I haven´t seen a movie looking this good in a long time. But even if the script allows him to create as strange and stylish environments as possible, the weak script is also The Cell´s downfall. It is simply not interesting enough to follow the FBI:s search for the girl back in the real world, because it feels like you are watching a simple TV-thriller or something. And in the end, Catherine´s journey just becomes too much. But the actors do fine performances, Jennifer Lopez proves that she can act and that she´s not just a pretty face, and Vincent D´Onofrio is very scary as one of the creepiest villains in moviehistory. It is just Vince Vaughn who seems a bit miscast, but he´s OK. Despite the sometimes confusing script, this is still pretty enjoyable, if you can handle all the violence and gore, that is. The movie has some interesting references, for example when Vaughn´s agent says that he believes that a kid who´s been sexually abused and such still can grow up and be a normal person, and not a psycho. It made me think a bit. It´s also fascinating to see, in the end, that many of the events hang together and actually makes sense. * * * ½ out of * * * * *",The Cell

But there is no evidence that this technology helps people to get better, so we expect the operator (jennifer lopez) will do something special to prove it. In the meanwhile, there is a girl missing and FBI desperately wants to use this machine to solve a case and find the serial killer.In the end, our idiot FBI agent ""remember"" to get a better look at the clues instead of killer's mind and realizes that he should look up for the company who built the equipment for our serial killer. Clearly he didn't need this machine to resolve the case. As for serial killer, this special machine only helped to kill him rather than help him. Obviously machine concept is just an excuse to Tarsem show off his visual imagination.Because movie doesn't provide any suspense or thrill like Silence of the Lambs or Seven to follow clues to find the serial killer or his prey.

It is apparent to me that this is one of those studio executive directed flicks. My speculation is they picked a first time director and a MTV Goddess (Jennifer Lopez) so that they would have no problems pushing them around - to make that lowest common denominator movie they seem to love. Who can argue, they sucked in at least $70 million plus rentals for a $33 million dollar budget.

179,sirfire,Artistic stunning cinematography,8,7 September 2012,"I can accept some people will be shocked by this film and if you don't want to look inside the mind of a madman or be curious enough to wonder why serial killers become serial killers then avoid this movie at all costs as it is disturbing.Many seem to compare this movie to imaginary worlds like ""Flatliners"" and ""The Matrix"" and in some ways I can see the similarities.To keep it simple the story is about Jennifer Lopez who is a Child Physiologist Social Worker who is using a new technology of going into children's dreams to try and break them out of the troubles they are in.A Serial killer who is in a comatose before his last potential victims is found and the police a fighting time before she dies and they ask Jennifer Lopez Character to go into his dreams to hopefully save her.You get to see the inside of many serial killers mind and reasons why they become an anti-social psychopath and this lends to the artistic imaginations of the director which in some ways scares many and as in other reviews shocks many. I personally believe it was well done but in other ways it was contrived and with more with the character development less visual effect's it could have been a winner, remember this is a horror/suspense thriller and if you are shocked then the directors goal was achieved.So if you are into visual effects and horror genre with a fascination into a serial killers mind and a point of view based on many case studies and it shows that all madmen are made by society's failures to protect children not born!",The Cell
180,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,This is a movie you should not miss,10,28 August 2000,"The Cell is pretty dammed bizarre to be sure, but it is one of the most challenging films I've seen in quite a while. The detective scenes are as smartly done as those in Se7en, and the dream scape inside the killers' mind scenes are as strange and beautiful as a well-directed NIN or Marilyn Manson video. After watching it for the second time (it's that type of movie), I was struck by how seriously it took its subject matter. There really aren't any light moments in it, but I wasn't bothered by its tone, and I wouldn't call it pretentious,  I was simply fascinated by its energy and endless imagination. I hope that the unusual visuals and slightly bent storyline doesn't scare audiences away. It's a wonderful film and it deserves to be seen, just try not spend the whole movie trying to decipher its images. The bare bones of the plot is easy to follow, but you can go mad while trying to figure out the significance of certain scenes. Save that for the second viewing.Jennifer Lopez is a star, and she really shines in this one. She's naturally so stunningly beautiful that when you see her in her idealized self inside the mind, it is quite a sight. She's a hottie, I just wish she'd give up the singing and get back to making movies on a regular basis. It's good to see Vince Vaughn in a good movie again (Psycho still leaving a bad taste in my mouth). This guy has a lot of potential, he just needs to be in the right projects. Vincent D'Onofrio is an interesting actor, and he seems to make a habit of playing very strange and unusual characters. The guy he plays in this one is creepy even by serial killer standards. He's the kind of killer that gives Dahmer and Manson the creeps. I've seen serial killers portrayed better in other films, but Vincent does well. We're so used to seeing Hannibal Lector, insane genius types in films that his turn as a more simple beast is a little different. He's very methodical, but you don't get any real sense of genius in him, which probably makes him more realistic, just not as fun to watch as Spacey in Se7en or Tom Noonan in Manhunter. The big surprise is Tarsem Singh, former commercial and music video director's (I really need to find out which ones) big screen debut. The world of music videos is turning out some of the most interesting directors in film today (David Fincher immediately comes to mind). He's going to have a hard time finding a project after this that lets him be so free to create whole new worlds of unreality to play in, but I eagerly await his next offering. This movie deserves a 10/10 stars just for being so fresh. I wish more movies showed this kind of imagination. G'night!",The Cell
181,mig28lx,DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW! YOU WON'T LIKE IT!,9,30 December 2000,"This movie is perfect.  I'm not talking about the dialogue, I'm not talking about the acting, I'm not even really talking about the stunning visuals. I'm talking about the amount of discussion it generates.  You either love this movie or you hate this movie.  I think that's MARVELLOUS.  It's like ""Fight Club""; plenty of people hated it, plenty of people marvelled at it. Because a movie is capable of creating such dissention among movie fans, I think that ranks it with the best masterpieces of the past like ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Taxi Driver"", and ""2001"", to name a few.Also, a quick history lesson, which I'm sure many of the more literary readers will already know.  Igor Stravinsky composed one of the finest pieces of ""modern"" music in the early 1900's, ""The Rite of Spring"" ballet. It is today considered a classic.  However, when it premiered in Paris, the audience not only booed...they rioted.  They threw rocks at the orchestra and the dancers in hopes they would discontinue; fights broke out, not only in the performance hall, but on the streets outside.People very often fear what they do not understand, and the least of these people react in a very violent manner...either physically OR verbally. Think about that.  Then go watch this film again.  If you STILL don't like it, more power to you.  All I ask is you give it a chance...because mark my words:This film will be remembered long after the curtain has fallen on our lives.(PLEASE respond to this review if you have any thoughts at all; I welcome the opportunity to defend my argument.)",The Cell

The FBI agents were like stick people.  And Jen L seemed to be modeling barbie clothes, not acting in a movie.   Even the DVD ""extra"" material like the behind the scenes stuff was DULL DUll dull.  And if I hear one more Director talk about how he LOVED one of his deleted scenes even thought it clearly would have added nothing to the movie and made even less sense then the stuff he kept in I will scream.

They did just that here and there are some very clever visuals.The story wasn't all that bad either but it wasn't strong enough to last to the end. You could almost hear it running out of breath as the 2 hour visual marathon counted down.Despite the weak ending I would still recommend seeing this in the theater, at matinee prices.

There is NO tension here, even his struggles to break open her cell are anticlimactic and inevitable. As mean as it sounds it might have been more powerful if they had been too late and he rushes back to Jennifer Lopez' side to help her destroy the evil serial killer.  Forget that, way too complicated.Then there's Jennifer Lopez' desire to save ""the child inside"" of the serial killer, so she goes back in on her own. PLEEEEEASE.  How convenient they built a system where she can easily lock out all the SCIENTISTS and go it alone.  Contrived enough? Nope, she also knows how to set the system up in a specific untried way that allows the killer into her mind.  Well, it happened just like that and in a wonderfully gory sequence she defeats him ""on her turf"".  Now if that's not enough, she manages to save ""the boy inside"" by drowning him in a baptismal-like ceremony. Back in the ""real world"" the killer dies from the relief of being saved? Humm, guess so.Ok, sure - why the heck not?  You want a happy ending, BUT it was so formula and anticlimactic. It would have been much stronger if the killer actually fooled her into thinking she defeated him and used her to escape to another body - like the little boy she was trying to reach in the beginning. Is that possible? Of course it is...this is a movie.",The Cell

If I were to break this film down into components I would say it's an even mixture of ""The Matrix"" and ""Strange Days"" with more than a generous touch of the Grateful Dead to make this journey complete. The movie began true to form, your run of the mill type of serial killer movie. Then, after about the first thirty minutes or so, the movie took a hard right turn onto the exit marked ""Oz"" and never returned. The special effects were very well done, and the acting was decent, but I found the story quite weak. On a scale of 1-10, I gave ""The Cell"" 4 qualudes, and 2 valium for a total of 6.",The Cell

Well, I think she is completely successful as a spunky, sensitive psychiatric social worker with a gift of empathy with disturbed children. Also, people feel that the film is needlessly gory, or simply needless, as it examines the psychotic mind. Hey, folks, this isn't the first film to go up that alley. The envisioning of the psychotic's mind is brilliantly and stunningly communicated through artful and fantastic visions. The plot's hokey? Okay, I'll give you that one (SPOILER: Just where did he get all that running water in the middle of the desert? And how did he get those huge, heavy panes of glass down that little door?). But I think of this film as a science fiction flick, and logical plotting is not the hallmark of the science-fiction world.

But the Visuals (as art of cinematography, not as in pure special effects) just blew me away! Some sequence of the movie reminds me of Bergman's the 7th Seal and Tsui Hark's original Chinese Ghost Story, and Anh Hung Tran's the Scent of Green Papaya!  It's a brilliant debut for Singh.It's definitely a movie should be seen on big screens.",The Cell
187,buyjesus,multi-faced genre-defying debut,7,6 January 2001,"Loaded with potential, The Cell is an ambitious project by first time director Tarsem Singh that falls a bit short.   Jennifer Lopez plays a roamin' around aimlessly in her apartment smokin' pot child psychologist ( in a needlessly gratuitous scene, but hey I'm a guy and it is Jennifer Lopez's ass so I'm not gonna exactly complain per se) involved in an advanced brudgeoning science experiment in which a bunch of electrodes and doowads are connected to two participants, one of which can actually enter the mind of the other.   Lopez's experimental techniques are currently the subject of a comatose son of a famed multimillionaire tycoon.   The project is still in its early phases and making any sort of psychological process in understanding the child's subconscious (who also suffers from autism) is a painstaking process. Suddenly, Lopez's work is cut short for a day by an FBI unit (headed by Vince Vaughn) in dire need of locating a seemingly doomed victim of a serial killer, who has recently been rendered unconscious himself.The film then divides into two parts at this sequence, the dream world and the real world.   Unfortunately, the real world sequence with Agent Vaughn hot on the pursuit is tame, predictable serial killer fodder.  The real hidden gem of this movie lies in the tactful, surreal subconscious cinematography of Lopez's journey into the disturbed brain map of the killer (played by Full Metal Jacket's Gomer Pyle; Vincent D'Onfrio- who makes the most of the script he's given.)  Taking cues from music video, Singh crafts cinemascapes of horrific splendor and imagination that separate this film from your run of the mill suspense/slasher flick.   A great deal of effort was put into making obscene, diseased, and often forgivably nonsensical sensory experience.  He has a knack for the twisted and perverted (much like Mark Romanek's reconstructions of Joel Peter-Witkins photography for Nine Inch Nails' `Closer' video.) and has created a Hollywood movie that defies tradition by trying exploring the seldom explored subconscious (the only other successful example I can think of being Being John Malkovich)  and for that alone, respect is due.   Definitely worth a sitting or two.",The Cell

However, Lopez's performance doesn't add (or detract) from the film.  The rest of the cast does a great job, as well as the visual FX crew...  There are times that the movie seems to be missing a sequence of scenes.  The ""dream"" sequences are great, with stunning visual effects (the Horse scene alone is fascinating!)...  But, there are times when the story loses a chapter and skips ahead.  Some of the plot points do get resolved (the child, for example), but others are just a bit off...,  There are also times when the plot moves ahead TOO quickly and points are missed.  Lopez does get some great lines, but they seem out of place for her character (especially the ""this is my dream"" line...)....

I am impressed with Jennifer Lopez as an actress, she has a conservative but deep portrayal of the social worker turned mind reader.

He keeps his victims in a tank that slowly fills with water until the woman drowns. He has been caught, but not before he could capture one last victim and place her in the tank. Lopez must find where this tank is and save the girl. The mind sequences are fascinating, your eyes are glued to the screen while you sit in awe. Yes, the movie is violent, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, the movie gets its reputation from the disturbing images. Some of the images may be something you'd rather not look at, you won't look away, you may want to, but you don't. It's an intense movie that keeps you interested, and doesn't rely on the visuals, those come as sweet extras. The story that goes along with the visuals seems like a totally separate movie from the mind sequences, you want to watch both.

It is the most visually stunning film that I have ever seen and each scene is an art in its own way and of course it helps if the director takes inspirations from famous paintings. I would rate it as high as Silence of the Lambs and even though it bears a similar premise it adds sci-fi and visual imagery to heighten the effect.

In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time. But, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts.The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite complete).Later on DVD and Video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut (in Germany, there is already such a version around, running approx. 110 minutes).It would be nice, if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavourable rating, so that I as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously, not only as a resource of money.",The Cell

I did have a vague idea of the subject matter, and it may have been that which drew me to it.Potential Spoiler coming.Jennifer Lopez plays a psychiatrist who works in a facility that enables them to enter the minds of others. Reason being, to get through to them if they are in a coma, primarily. A serial killer is apprehended and has fallen into a coma and someone needs to get into his head to find out where he has hidden his last victim, who they are sure is alive, if his past exploits are anything to go by. True enough, she is alive but not for long. Her life is on a timer and they need to get to her fast. This makes for a fascinating peek into the director's version of the mind of a serial killer. This proves to be a very entertaining and uncomfortable picture, capturing the mind of our killer quite beautifully, in all its captivating and miserable honesty. Like watching an accident from a passing car, it is not possible to tear your eyes away from some of the horrors. Not nightmarish in a circus/barnpot type way, but disturbing in a forbidding and threatening fashion. You don't feel Lopez is in any real danger physically, but you fear she may lose her mind, which would appear to be far scarier. I loved the picture. It's use of lighting and sets were exemplary and Lopez seems to enjoy her role, judging by her believable portayal. Not enjoyable but doing everything it can very well to disturb the viewer.

Nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. I had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later. Like ""Silence of the Lambs"" it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors, Like ""Flatliners"" the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and ""making sense"" are not necessary, which makes it a film-maker's dream too.The only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons.

Actually ""delight"" is probably the wrong word, the movie being about a serial killer and all, but you know what I mean.This was the first time I saw a movie based on the director's music video reputation and I was expecting nothing more than flashy cool visuals. However this film has some depth to it too. It doesn't present a clichéd villain but instead the screenwriter has the courage to say it's not as simple as that.  Is it possible to condemn the crime but have sympathy for the killer?  Can you get rid of the evil side of someone and nurture the inner child?While that is going on Protosevich sets a traditional clock ticking as the FBI agent tries to save the last victim in time.Jennifer Lopez's character is only sketched but there is enough detail there to know where she is coming from.

She was excellent in Selena, and pretty good in Money Train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself.  However, roles like this just draw the line.  I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues.  When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.Lopez's acting here is typically below average.  I can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has.  She's no Julia Roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field.  Well, she's not even in the same stadium.  Sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it certainly doesn't carry this one.  With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.Having said all that, this film is visually stunning.  The colors are fabulous, and the story line isn't half bad in a B-movie kind of way.  The audio here is superb as well.

If you have a weak stomach or can't like a movie without everything spelled out very easily for you, then skip this one.Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as the Serial Killer. He shows that there can be humanity in a sick sick person. I can see why he would be drawn to this challenging role.Jennifer Lopez was good. Her job was mostly to seem highly empathetic which she did well in her role as a children's social worker. Many people here don't seem to know that social workers are also often trained and licensed in counseling. I did not find it odd that her character would keep Carl's dog, Valentine. She would remember Carl how he was as a child, trying to survive and sacrificing himself for her good.Vince Vaughan seemed decent and haunted by his past as a horribly abused child himself. If he hadn't seemed such a decent man, the plot wouldn't have worked and I like to see him doing a role other than the smart-ass shallow guy as he has done recently.I find this movie life affirming in many ways, not anti-life. It shows that horribly abused children can grow up to be protectors (Vaughan) not just serial killers. It shows that someone with an organic mental illness (like the serial killer) might have been a good person if his father hadn't been such a horrible abuser and that there is still good in most people.Other than that, it is all about the visuals. Tarsem Singh kicks all kinds of butt with the visuals.

Either my taste in movies has changed (which I think is partially true), or this movie largely stank. Clumsily plotted and paced,  this movie drones on and on without ever really engaging the viewer. Unlike ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Matrix""  (which in recent commercials for this film was compared to), it lacks the emotional dexterity and depth of either. Instead, we get a soggy music video, not any more disturbing than something from 'Nine Inch Nails' and certainly nowhere near the type of harrowing exeprience I expected after seeing the trailers and hearing the buzz. All in all, pretty mediocre. Oh well! Go see it for the trailers of ""Lost Souls"" and ""Unbreakable"", which unlike this film actually seem to contain genuine thrills! We'll see.....",The Cell

211,Kiwi-7,"Stunning surrealist art in a film, and a story too",8,23 May 2001,"I give this film 8/10 overall.  Visually, a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning:  an art director's dream mix of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe--and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form.  Beautiful use of color, form, imagery, environment--and fabulous set decoration, combine with state-of-the-art computer graphics.  So, 10/10 for that! Wow!The plot line is, well, more predictable.  You know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end, but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there.  6/10 for that.Squirm factor...I won't give this a rating, but the film certainly made me squirm, and I was watching it on video on a tv screen.  It would, of course, have a great deal more impact on a big screen.  Graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape--even if beautiful--is highly unpredictable.  The world inside the killer's head is not--thank goodness!--my world.  Because I watched this film on video, I was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going, and I suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time, just for the ""visual art"".General suggestion:  don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you're keen on the visual look of films, like surrealist art, don't mind a bit of kinky gore, and just want to take a bit of a ""mind trip"", this one's a winner.

212,Caustic Pulp,It could've been so memorable and so good...,3,24 August 2000,"Let me first say that this movie doesn't suck, and you should go see it. Because despite its flaws, it entertains, and that's what's important.
The visual effects are stunning to the core and Jennifer Lopez's ass actually doesn't star in this movie. She's proven that she actually CAN act (even if in extremely forced dramatic moments), and she does add a lot to the movie.The script itself is rather thin and is more like a placemat for which the plate of CG goodness is set upon. The visuals are really remarkable, and if the core of the movie didn't stink, it might have been so good.
The movie doesn't really have a good story to tell. It has scenes that will shock you, will disturb you, and will make you laugh (if unintentionally). But for the most part, you're gonna see it for the visuals.The much talked about nun scene is, quite honestly, dumb, forced, and tacky. Vince Vaughn, who I've worshipped since Swingers, doesn't really get his groove on until well into the movie - clunky dialogue and a bad haircut basically ruin any chance of us seeing him act professionally. He has his moments, but he really sucks in this movie.So, to summarize:  Marginal acting  Forced dialogue  Workable plot  Incredible visual effects ...and most importantly, everyone else said that this movie was very self-important. In retrospect, I have to agree. Here's a movie that takes itself too seriously for its own good. A director like Sam Raimi could've turned this into something good, but Tarsem Singh was either trying too hard or was too arrogant about his vision.Go see it, because it IS entertaining. But it's weighted down from being the memorable cult classic it could be by a series of wretched flaws.",The Cell

214,Lt Wolf Maker,Freudian trash. [[spoilers]],5,2 September 2001,"Basically yet ANOTHER predictable, boring, slow paced ""Silence of the Lambs"" rip-off.The Cell is extremely dumbed down for its audience -- they seem to think that we're as inane as our public educations would suggest.  There might as well have been huge yellow arrows pointing at D'Onofrio with ""crazy bad guy"" spelt out nearby, or at that albino dog with ""pseudo-exotic symbol for crazy bad guy's soul.""Lopez (magnanimous as always) is some sort of sugarsweet Mary Poppins character that magically makes everything better for everyone.  A hateless, unhated curly-topped Curly Sue.  The Saint of all Saints?  (How un-sacrilegious of our dear Catholic conceptor and this, his psychological daystallion/nightmare.)  Vaughn, on the other hand, is nasty.  This man couldn't act himself out of bed in the morning.  I'm glad somebody finally disemboweled him.  (I was having an urge to do something similar...)Albeit all that, final remark: I actually recommend at least one sit through.  Simple reason is that the sequences where you FINALLY enter D'Onofrio's brain are beyond words.  Incredible cinematography that hasn't been seen before [aftertaste not of Liquid Television quality, but still interesting].  These vignettes are obviously the only talent of our director -- they are greatly different in style than the surrounding lameness of the ""crime investigation.""

The rest of it (the inexcusable, pathetically boring stale bread surrounding the delectable delicatessen choice meats) is completely avoidable and too predictable to be taken seriously.

Then I pretty much forgot about it, but the other day I saw it in the $1 bin and grabbed it. ""The Cell"" has some incredible cinematography that brings the hallucinations of disturbed minds to vivid life. Very imaginative and extremely creepy. Sadly, it also passes up a chance for one of the greatest visuals of all. It's quite disappointing when there's not even a glimpse of Jennifer Lopez's famous butt. Why hire JLo and then not have her turn around even once? What a waste. Anyway, ""The Cell"" bombed big-time, both critically and box-office-wise, but it's an exquisitely made film that really delivers in all departments. An original concept, a clever script, some fine acting, and the aforementioned visuals that are astounding and striking and imaginative. No CGI, it's all amazing sets and spooky lighting and skillful makeup. It deserved a far better fate than what it got.",The Cell
216,bosochima,"Don't Be Fooled...This is NOT ""The Next Matrix""",6,20 August 2000,"I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 rating, which reflects my disappointment in watching it. The TV advertisements were really cool, so I was surprised to find the movie to be a bit of a chore to get through. The story is similar to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but with a far inferior script and a cast of instantly forgettable actors, including Lopez, who confirms many people's assessment that she can sort of act (and sort of sing and sort of dance) but brings nothing truly interesting or inspired to the art. There were many times during the film I felt like I was watching a really bad TV police drama. A note to Hollywood writers: if you have more than three characters whose main purpose is to sit around waiting for other actors to do something, you have a problem! Also, about every fourth sequence in the movie involved someone being tortured, which I found difficult to watch after a while.As far as the special effects go, they were OK, but had nowhere near the visceral impact of ""The Matrix."" What many in the movie-making industry have yet to figure out is the reason the SFX ""worked"" in that movie (as well as ""Star Wars,"" ""2001,"" heck, even ""The Wizard of Oz"") is because in these movies the EFFECTS served the STORY, not the other way around. There was some nice cinematography, but all in all the visuals weren't great or even very good.If you must see this film, save your money and wait for the video.

The horror is extremely chilling and is all psychologically disturbed and in some points just down-right bizarre. The plot is this: in a future world, where advanced technology can allow human beings to "" walk through the mind of another"" by sending them to sleep and connecting their brains. It is proved useful when a masochistic serial killer who drowns his victims in a glass container, has a seizure and goes into a coma. The whereabouts of his latest victim can only be found in the deranged and warped mind of the killer, which must be explored by J-Lo. The film features some randomly bizarre sequences including a horse being vivisected and a cow's head spinning rapidly like a washing machine and the blood pouring into a bucket. The film also contains some really nasty violence, a guy's intestines are stuck to a roller wheel ( imagine it as a large rolling pin with spikes on it) and then the wheel is slowly turnt unravelling the guy's intestines and wrapping them around the wheel. The horror is amazing and has some truly creepy moments as well as one scene that makes you jump so high you hit the ceiling. Overall, a great film 10 out of 10.",The Cell

221,spazierganger,"Twisted, but incredible",8,19 August 2000,"The Cell has to be one of the most unique movies to come out in a long time. Tarsem Singh has provided us with a great visual movie. Not that it's just based on visuals. While the effects are amazing, the story holds up too. Some people have complained that this is ""just another serial killer movie,"" which is entirely not true, in my opinion. Yes, the villain, Carl Stargher, is a serial killer, but the movie makes us look at him, not so much as a terrible evil person, but as a very sick man who needs help. It makes us feel sorry for him, while still being disgusted by the things he does.That's another thing, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It's rated R, and it earned that rating. In addition to the nudity, the violence in the film is especially gory, and at many times is utterly disgusting. I don't mean that in a bad way, but the movie isn't for everyone. If you can handle it, then it doesn't take away from the film, because it's done in an artful way.The only weak spot in the film, I thought, was the acting of Jennifer Lopez. While not absolutely horrible, there were some spots where she seemed a little wooden, and there are many actresses who could have played the role better. It also could've been worse though. That said, the rest of the acting is great. Vince Vaughn was impressive, and Vincent D'Onofrio was especially good as Carl Stargher. He plays Stargher like a man who knows what he's doing is terrible, but can't stop himself. Like I said before, you almost feel sorry for him. Jake Thomas is also good as the young Stargher.All in all, this is a great movie. It certainly will not appeal to everyone, and if you don't think you can handle the levels of twisted violence, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you don't mind that, you will find a movie with a great, original plot, and absolutely stunning special effects. The Cell is one of the most creative films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.Rating: 9/10 (1 point off for Lopez)",The Cell
222,wezzel,Not that good,7,3 January 2002,"The Cell is not half as good as it thinks it is.  Though the basic premise of the movie is quite good, I just couldn't relate to any of the characters. They are all bland and cold, we don't know a thing about them, and frankly we don't care (at least I didn't).  Also the visuals aren't really that good.  The trip when Vaugn goes to save Lopez was a complete rip off from the one in '2001' and most of the other set-pieces were just boring.  They always reminded me of the video for 'Firestarter' by The Prodigy, and I really hate that song. The Cell will probably get a cult following, but it will never be a match for 'Silence of the Lambs' or 'Se7en'Most Memorable Movie Moment: J-LO showing us why it's a bad idea to get nipple piercings.Rating: 5/10",The Cell
223,oxblood,"Nightmarishly good, but far from perfect.",7,13 January 2005,"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim. Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmare-ish painting in motion, from the landscapes to the costumes. But the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about. Without him, you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only, which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary. Lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway, though she's as gorgeous as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he overacts to boot. He tried too hard to become his character and it showed. Stick to comedy, Vince!

224,benjamin-ryan,The Cell Film Review,3,5 April 2014,"The Cell is all style and no substance, a movie that is visually impressive even by today's standards but with a cast you don't care for, weak dialogue/script including a hollow story that raises many questions about the technology used throughout the film. Additionally, it is a movie that has been done better before, think Silence of the Lambs or the influx of sci fi movies that came out around the same time including (but not limited to); Dark City (1998), The Matrix (1999), The Thirteenth Floor (1999).Although the movie has a relatively short runtime of 1 hour 30minutes it spends too long trying to build suspense and tension. The latest victim of a serial killer, is trapped with only 40 hours to live, unless the FBI find her before she drowns. Building suspense and tension meant it wasn't until half way through the movie where the movie's main 'attraction' or selling point happened with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) entering the mind of Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) who at times appears to channel Norman Bates (quiet, weird, loner type).The films strongest aspect is the wildly vivid imagery and thankfully it still stands up 14 years later. It is clear while watching inside Stargher's mind scenes, that director Tarsem Singh, has taken heavy inspiration from works of art by the likes of; Hirst, Nedrum and Giger. It's as if the director needed an excuse for the plot to show such uniquely disturbing images, that varied in styles including the recurring theme of water, and misogyny which normally in a movie wouldn't blend together. The director came up with the idea of going into the mind of a disturbed schizophrenic, using some kind of newly created experimental technology, which then made it possible to incorporate his eerie dream like sequences. Never once was it explained what this experimental technology was, how it worked, or any detail about the device, the machine was also rather reminiscent of the virtual world used in The Matrix released the previous year and worked in a relatively similar fashion.Other than the vivid imagery, the movies only other saving grace is Vincent D'Onofrio, who excels at what little he has been given to work with. Vincent D'Onofrio is the standout of an otherwise mediocre cast, a cast many people may be scratching their head over. The leads are a singer (Lopez) and a comedian (Vaughn). Having a poor cast is one thing then to go and have no character depth, weak script/writing and clichéd lines these hamper the film even further.The only reason anyone should watch The Cell is for the creative visuals, costumes, set pieces displayed and Vincent D'Onofrio's strong acting, which shows how truly underrated he is as an actor. This has people questioning why he doesn't get much work.Those looking for a good sci fi, horror, thriller should look elsewhere, as this story is forgetful, with no surprises or twists. Its predictable and has a clichéd Hollywood style ending.Further viewing; Silence of the Lambs, Dark City, The Matrix, The Thirteenth Floor.",The Cell

226,Justin-62,The Cell is by far the strangest movie I have ever seen!,7,17 August 2000,"The film starts off with a surreal walk over a massive sand dune to blaring Arabic music, and gets stranger from there.Jennifer Lopez plays psychologist Catherine Deane who, through the wonder of modern science, goes inside the mind of schizophrenic patients.  In the movie's opening scenes, we learn that she is participating in research project to bring catatonic schizophrenics back to reality.  This premise is the set up for the main story in which the FBI is trying to stop a schizophrenic serial killer who's crimes are becoming more frequent.  As luck would have it, the Feebs catch up with the killer as he collapses into a permanent state of catatonia.  The problem is the he is the only one who knows where his latest victim is being hidden.  Desperate to find the girl before she dies (in a manner that gives rise to the film's title) Catherine (Lopez) goes into the mind of the killer in hopes of finding the missing girl.What follows is a series of very strange scenes I really can't find the words to describe.  The visual imagery of The Cell is at times beautiful and at times disturbing.  The sets and costumes are elaborate and well crafted. If the academy isn't turned off by the story, The Cell could pick up a couple of nods in February.A few cautions about this film.  If you do not like movies that jump around with little continuity, I would recommend you pass on this one.  Also, this film is rated ""R"" and I would take the rating very seriously.  Although the language is minimal, there is some violence and numerous depictions of mutilated female bodies (many of them nude).I don't know that I can go so far as to say I liked The Cell, but it was definitely better than I expected.

First off the movie starts off slow, and then when it begins to pick up speed, it falls apart towards the end, with no real accomplishment of what they originally set out to do.

Jennifer Lopez and Vincent Vaughn do a great job in their roles, although Vaughn's could have been explored a little more.  This movie isn't about the characters, though--it's about the visuals.  You will be on the edge of your seat during this entire movie, but be forewarned--it is extremely violent and graphic.

229,Fox in Socks,Lopez through the looking glass,7,17 October 2001,"Aaah, this took me back to the seventies... trippy visuals, psychedelic landscapes, style over substance, sadly also rather wooden acting, unconvincing dialogue and emotionless direction.This was actually very enjoyable; there's a solid serial killer plot, beautiful art direction, and a very good performance by Vincent D'Onofrio in various guises. It's well put together, reasonably gripping, and even made me squirm.There is nothing original here - the standard theme of finding the victim before suffocation has appeared in various films and TV episodes, usually involving coercion of the kidnaper. Go back to 1971 and Dirty Harry for an example. Entering someone's dreams has also been done, although admittedly rarely as well as this (Dreamscape, Freddy Krueger series).
Although very pretty, the movie does ultimately come across as a pop video. Great visuals, good enough for a second viewing, with lovely set pieces. However, it doesn't haunt you. The concepts don't stay with you as they did with ""Videodrome"" or ""Altered States"", and while suspension of disbelief is important in cinema, a little effort to explain HOW J-Lo was getting into the imagination of another character would have helped.

The plot is also top notch (Tarsem Singh & Mark Protosevich are two people i'll keep my eye on) from opening seen to closing credits i was absorbed by this movie.  The acting was kinda...not really bad...but kinda off at the beginning but EVERYONE found their groove as the movie progressed.  This movie should be seen by EVERY horror fan out there.  The Cell is also not style over substance like I feared it would be, the characters' motivations are believable and the characters themselves are truely more than one dimensional cardboard pawns just to get us from one stunning scene to the next.  The costumes, sets, makeup, and visual effects are all Oscar worthy but the writer and director are way to smart to just let the movie be all flash and no substance.  The movie also has some truely harrowing scenes of when Stargher was abused by his father but those scenes needed to be harrowing to further explain and flesh out the character.  All together this is the best movie i've seen since Fight Club and by far The Cell is in my opinion the best serial killer movie ever (yep to me it's a million times better than Silance of the Lambs...but then again so is Se7en).  Great direction, writing, production design, costumes, makeup (including the effects makeup like a great intestines pulling scene), and a great Howard Shore score.

Right from the opening scene, with Jennifer Lopez - looking quite a vision in white! - riding a black horse in a desert, with a very catchy, Indian/Middle-Eastern music playing in the background, to the beginning of the end credits (with the same haunting Indian/Middle- Eastern music playing), this film is quite something!I wonder how did they ever think of such a plot? I mean, OK, they thought of going inside someone else's mind--but to actually show it with such visuals, that's what needs all the appreciation. The entire film is a vision, like a dream, like an exquisite artwork. And the best thing is that the director doesn't waste any time in establishing the plot and his surreal - and a bit disturbing - visions. It's like snap snap snap!--and a scene is done, and I was like: What did I just see now? The locations, the sets, the costumes, the looks of the three main characters when they enter their subconscious zones--the visuals will attract you like a magnet.

234,eric20other2002,Excellent Film...Jennifer's BEST Performance...,8,21 February 2007,"I saw this film while visiting my mothers house for my sister's baby shower, she had owned this film for a while and I never put it on. Every time I saw the trailer I wanted to see the film, but never had it. So finally I said the hell with it and watched. And I think I should slap myself silly(as a movie buff I should've seen it a long time ago). This film is one of those thrillers that doesn't come by very often. The premise is simple and interesting; a serial killer who tortures his victims, kills them, than makes them into dolls is finally caught, but not before he has some sort of seizure that leaves him comatose. If the police don't get to his latest victim within 40 hours she will die, so they need Jennifer Lopez's character to enter into his mind(she's a hypnotherapist)and gain his trust and find out where the victim is. The film is fast paced when it needs to be and it takes its time when it needs to. In other words the editing is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Although, the film is categorized as being Sci-Fi/Thriller, there is quite a bit of Drama involved that gives the killer's character a sympathetic side(like Frankenstein's Monster). And Jennifer Lopez shows that she can definitely act(unlike Mariah Carey who is a better singer than actor). New Line Cinema has also released a pretty decent DVD(New Line is one of the best Horror movie distributors next to Anchor Bay). With two or three commentaries, deleted/alternate scenes and trailers. The only thing I have a problem with is the packaging. It's the easy to scratch type boxes(the kind Rush Hour came in). If New Line ever re-released this I would like a better box for it to come in and a making of documentary. Once again;a great film. If you haven't seen it go see it. If you like this film go see... Manhunter(1988) with Brian Cox as Hannibal Lektor(based on the Thomas Harris book The Red Dragon), Silence of the Lambs(1991) with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector(based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name) and Kiss the Girls(1997) with Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross(based on the John Patterson book of the same name).

I liked how they could expand and be as creative as they wanted with the story since it took place in Carl Starger's head. The directors and producers did a good job at portraying his angry father, and it made the audience dislike him. When they had the kid get all crazy in the desert i liked that and even when they had the women in the crop field when Vince Vaughn went in. I didn't like the fact though that everything had a foundation because if you went into my head, half of everything you wouldn't even understand. Although, they had a couple of intro's into his head that were pretty good but they should have kept on doing that about every couple of minutes or so to understand how different from reality all that is. This is a good movie, and is a little bit crazy. 8/10",The Cell

Throw in some very interesting special effects and you have The Cell.I have a very hard time understanding why anyone would want to watch a movie that so intensely depicts abduction and torture, and the sick mind that might do such things. I am not squeamish, but The Cell went waay too far. Don't let the special effects draw you in--that's why I went.

The acting was lame (my apologies to James Gammon, an actor I admire, who got stuck in this crappy flick, fortunately only for a couple of minutes).  This is one of those movies that will probably make lots of money playing to the stupidity of ignorant people, mainly male, who get off on seeing women tortured.  It's just the sort of thing to set off the lowliest sort of scum in our society.  This is the wrong way to make money.  Certainly the special effects people should be given credit for doing their job well, but that they accepted such a job demonstrates a lack of character and integrity.  The whole point of this movie was to thrill people who enjoy being grossed out, but it wasn't just a gross-out, it went too far into titillating the worst human senses.  There was hardly any plot.  There was almost no character development.  There was nothing but visual effect.  I might consider the dreamlike sequences well done if it were not for lack of control demonstrated by those in charge of creating them.  It is much more challenging to present horror by affecting the audience's imagination, and these special effects people weren't up to the challenge, so they took the easy way out and simply splashed the plastic gore and human degradation all over the screen.  The movie seemed to be providing an instruction manual to sociopaths on fun ways to torture and murder.",The Cell

The director has taken the fantasies, dreams, thoughts and fears from the mind and manifested them on the screen in excrutiatingly evocative images.The script and acting are unremarkable.

241,charly1,Generously gave it a 7 of 10...,7,29 August 2000,"I would love to write a glowing report about the story, the actors, the writing.  Instead, I can say the plot has too many flaws to rank this a must-see film.  We have seen this story before, done much better.  The performances were flat.  The only real performance might be Vincent D'Onofrio, but even he couldn't save the film.Jennifer proves once and for all that her a** is hers and not surgically altered. Many people will see it for that few seconds at her refrigerator.The film has been described as a cross between Matrix and Silence of the Lambs.  That might be said, although I heard fellow movie-goers saying a few other films bred into the screenplay.  Fact is, if you are looking for Silence or Matrix, go and rent them, because this falls short of the mark.After my negative comments, let's look at why I was generous enough to give rehashed plot and characters a 7 out of 10.  The visual imagery is simply stunning, beyond compare.  What the plot and actors lack, the sets more than make up for.  This is a film made for the big screen!  See it in the theater.  DVD isn't even quality enough for this.  Experience it in the theater at least once.Check your brain at the door and just enjoy the colors, bright, dark, emotional.  The cinematography is the real film, not the shoddy story along with it.Spoilers!!!!  Warning, do not read if you do not want to know more...Shoddy detective work by the FBI is simply disappointing.  The whole film pins the detective work on a woman entering a serial killer's mind to find a woman we barely care about.  She is never given much of a soul to make us care if they find her alive or not.  What agent would see a strange piece of machinery, which is obviously part of the mutilation chamber in the killer's home and no one is working on checking that angle until said detective ""goes into"" the killer's mind to save the well experienced child psychologist from remaining trapped.  Then, like a revelation, he sees the symbol from the machinery in the killer's mind and connects it to the real world, calls his people to find the manufacturer.  In the 30 plus hours they had to crack into the killer's brain, the FBI still hadn't finished setting up a grid in the killer's tiny home and no one had bothered to examine the cellar, where they found the incriminating video.  Instead, the FBI had focused on the messy, tiny attic for the grid.The little boy - his father is wealthy and the boy is found on a seal island in a coma.  Why tell us any of that?  Why introduce his parents for 2 minutes and introduce a possible bad relationship between the kid's father and Lopez, then never examine either thing?I feel that Singh has a brilliant career ahead of him if only he can find a more polished screenwriter than Protosevitch, who also might have a career if he puts his own thoughts on his own stories rather than churning out bad imitations of other original screenplays.We already know Lopez has a glorious career ahead of her.  Between modeling, acting, and singing, we will be seeing her for years.  She needs to be more careful about script control.  This character could have been more interesting, but again that falls on a poor writer.  At least she isn't acting with snakes anymore.Vin D'Onofrio needs more vehicles to show his talents.  Certainly, when the bio of Stephen King is made, he should get the role!Vince Vaughn has potential, but also needs to screen his roles more in the future, selecting the best vehicle to display his acting ability.Jake Weber, as usual, plays it low-key, barely noticeable by most movie-goers.  Good character actor.",The Cell
242,mse1576,Stunning Cinematic Sequences; very creative,7,25 August 2000,"I enjoyed what Tarsem Singh tries to accomplish: telling a somewhat familiar tale by using incredible camera tricks in key areas of the film.
Once you see Jennifer Lopez in this film, you will realize that it was not her acting ability that got her the title role. Her beauty make up for her lack of emotion. Yet, she is effective.
However,help thinking that Meryl Streep would have crushed in the female lead role.I think that Hollywood would do well to look outside this country for talented directors. So many trained in America are so influenced by the Hollywood smash-bang blockbuster mentality .What American director would have thought of using the camera like that during the baptism sequence? Not many that come to my mind. It seems that in the movies from India that I have seen the direction is very much focused on visuals, and using the camera creatively. It would be nice to see this in more mainstream Hollywood films.",The Cell

I've seen more disturbing visuals in music videos than in this movie. In fact, now that I think about it the whole movie looked more like a music video than the disturbing thriller it was supposed to be.

245,Benzzo,Daring to be different.,10,24 August 2000,"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations.  This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent.  This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting.  To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point.  This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow.  ""The Cell"" has just opened the door to another world of imagination.  So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more?  Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the ""genre"" is a bit overworked.  The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed.  But ""The Cell"" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another.  Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. ""The Cell"" wants to let you ""see"" what it's all about and not ""how"" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like.  True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another.  Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing.  I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like.  If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself.  Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought ""The Cell"" was.  If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time.  I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as ""weird"" or ""crazy"".  I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley.  Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say ""Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.""  If so, I want what he was smoking.**** (out of 4)",The Cell
246,doug_burton,Visually stimulating film that falls a little short,7,25 August 2000,"Much has been made of the fact that Tarsem Singh, the director, also made the REM video ""Losing my Religion.""  The imagery in this movie is very similar to that of the REM video, and is absolutely stunning, and often disturbing. However, cinematography alone does not a movie make.  There also need to be believable characters and a compelling story.  While I enjoyed the film, because of the cinematography and the basic underlying premise (the technology that allows a psychotherapist to enter the mind of her patient), loose ends and plot holes left me feeling disappointed at the end.Jennifer Lopez, as the child psychologist Catharine Deane, was at her best during the surreal scenes inside the killer's mind, but in the ""real world"", she didn't seem to fit (Dr. Kent even alludes to the fact that Ms. Deane was unimpressive in her interview -- perhaps that was the intent of the director, to have Ms. Deane seem more alive in the dream world?)  Vince Vaughn, as FBI agent Peter Novak, is excellent in his portrayal of a driven man haunted by a past failing, and also (it is hinted) by his own abused past... but here we are only offered tantalizing bits, and are never given any deeper knowledge of his character.  I was hoping this aspect would be more fully explored when he entered the dream world as well, but it was not.Vincent D'Onofrio was both disturbing and, simultaneously, pitiable as the serial killer Carl Stargher.  In one of the most moving scenes, Ms. Deane confronts him as he relives the murder of his first victim -- and tells her of the time he was baptized and his father broke three of his ribs.  It takes a fine actor to be able to convey the menace of this character and at the same time elicit sympathy from the audience.One major plot hole gapes in this movie -- after Agent Novak enters the mind of the killer, he finds a clue that eventually leads to the discovery of the missing victim.  However, that clue was there all along, and did not need to be discovered in the mind of the killer.  How could a group of agents who are so thorough as to find a dog hair that eventually is traceable to the dog's owner, miss following up on an obvious clue in the killer's basement? Of course, if they had followed up on the clue, we wouldn't have needed to enter the mind of the killer, and we would have missed out on all the wonderful cinematography.  This, then, is where the movie falls short for me... the suspension of disbelief, not for the remarkable technology, but for the FBI agents being stupid.Rating: 7 out of 10, for the cinematography, and the fact that they showed clips from the 1973 French animated film, ""Fantastic Planet"".",The Cell
247,plu4085,Well worth watching,8,18 October 2006,"This movie disturbed me enough to write an IMDb comment, which is probably an indication of above-average qualities.Negatives: - Jennifer Lopez character (and to a certain extent acting) did not seem properly developed, and some crucial info may have been lost in the editing. Despite radiating warmth and compassion she remains a puzzle, and not a terrbily intriguing one. - Ditto for Vince Vaughn, though I think he did a better job in terms of acting. - The computer graphics at the beginning of Vaughn's trip weren't bad, but far from the visual imagination of the other trip scenes, and mostly yet another extension of the old ""2001"" stargate.Positives: - Extraordinary visuals in terms of sets, colors and photography for the trip scenes, excellent on every level. The focus on reduction, instead of overkill, is especially impressive. - Awesome costumes and makeup. - Vincent D'Onofrio displays his extraordinary range as an actor once more. - The sense of closure at the end was unusually rewarding for this type of movie, as Lopez' resolution of the serial killer's internal torture is multilayered and ambiguous.The other aspects of the movie, such as the race against time, the Fed investigation etc, were neither particularly good nor particularly bad. The commercial considerations reduce the full power of ""The Cell"" somewhat, but then what else is new?I liked and was partially very impressed with this movie, though it was unpleasant watching - I mean, REALLY unpleasant - at times.",The Cell
248,airviun,An original film that I would call intensive thriller with surrealism,6,8 January 2015,"I like Jennifer Lopez as a singer and as an actress too. In this film she suits her role perfectly as a doctor who enters subconsciousness of patients and tries to help them this way. So there are two worlds in this picture one is a real world we are all living in and the other one is the world of dreams that can be nice and wonderful, but also can be a darkest nightmare. It has some awkward moments that will make all sensitive and sentimental people close their eyes or turn their heads out of the screen. One of the lessons in this film is that if a child has a difficult childhood he can become a maniac in his adulthood. Afterall this film has a happy-end and I felt sympathy for Catherine because she stood her promise and helped Carl to break out from his past and become alright. A fair film that has it's ups and downs but after watching it you'll probably will remember it for long. Though it's not for everyone.",The Cell
249,Translucid2k4,Original and Thought Provoking Addition to the Thriller Genre.,8,11 April 2006,"Before watching this film, I wasn't sure what to expect. I only saw it recently, and since it's initial release in 2000 it seems to have been largely forgotten. That in mind, I wasn't expecting too much from it. However, ""The Cell"" really surprised me and turned out to be one of the very best of it's genre. The film works well on many different levels and is very interesting, original and entertaining. The whole premise for the film is very original I thought, and it has been delivered very well. Jennifer Lopez' character is a child physcologist of sorts who, with the aid of incredible new technology, delves deep into the minds of her patients to try and cure them. When a serial killer is found in a coma, she is hired to try and help discover where his latest victim is being held before it's too late.It's a simple premise and it has been very well delivered - as a viewer you never feel as if the story is running away with itself, everything is very well restrained and measured - it would have been all too easy for the writers to go ahead of themselves with this plot and lose the audience. The best part of the film for me was the amazing scenes in which Lopez is inside the mind of Carl, the clinically insane killer. These scenes have been superbly put together, with all kinds of Camera Lens trickery and some truly amazing visual effects. Probably the most impressive thing about these scenes is that they are all very well integrated and run very smoothly from one to the other - this is an important aspect of the film's success. Visual icons used to make the meaning of scenes and to push the narrative forward could have been too obvious and lost all credibility all to easily, but again these are very well realised and add to the whole strong intelligence of the movie. The use of colour composition and camera work is simply stunning on numerous occasions - the ""dream"" world of the killer's mind has been incredibly realised.The final winning aspect of this film is it's cast. This is the best I've ever seen Jennier Lopez in a serious role - why doesn't such pick such great roles like this anymore? Vince Vaughn puts in a strong performance as the ex-Lawyer turned Cop who is hell bent saving the latest of the killer's victims. Vincent D'Onofrio is outstanding as the deranged serial killer - probably the best performance in the film because he manages to capture the humanity of his evil character perfectly - a mature and sophisticated performance. Direction by Tarsem Singh is good - he has managed to command one of the finest Lopez performances ever here and for that, must be applauded. Overall - this film is a real winner. The cast strong, writing well realised and the cinematography is stunning throughout. An original, thought provoking and valuable addition to the Thriller genre.",The Cell

I was treated to a film that to me was entirely sickening, for a few reasons, firstly because of its explicit imagery of violence and of its linking sex and extreme violence against women and also of its playing down the seriousness of the violence by focusing on both aestheticism and on the ""good child that cannot help what has happenend to him and is therefore no longer responsible for what he has done as a bad man"".This may not be what the film intended to say, but it is what it said to me.

What I got was a visually stunning motion picture with a plot that never truly builds or climaxes. It's also chock-full of hollow characters (aside from Vince Vaughn's generically obsessive g-man) who we don't give a damn about. I keep hearing the phrases ""completely original"" or ""an experience you've never had at the movies"" being tossed around to describe this flick. In its defense- sure, it looks and sounds great with wardrobes, sets, and dream-worlds that are indeed unique and nightmarish. Yet the plot, about a serial killer and his persuers is rehashed from several different films: the gritty style and atmosphere (""Seven""), the heinous murderer (""Silence of the Lambs""), the getting-inside-of-your-mind idea (the forgotten, yet fabulous ""Dreamscape"" from the early-80's and ""Being John Malkovich"", too).Ebert must have known he was going to get a lot of flack for his gushing review (which might as well have hailed it as 2000's ""Citizen Kane"").

It is a very clever story about a psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) who uses a highly advanced virtual-reality device to enter the minds of her patients, which she must use to try and get crucial information from the mind of a comatose serial killer. The mind scenes are of course the most vivid, for they are awe-inspiring and unique. What would the mind of a serial killer look like? The Cell gives us a pretty good idea. Lopez does not need to be a great actress for this role; she puts just enough into this character to make it work. The plot is certainly impossible, and any attempt to explain how the mind probe works would just trivialize the entire film; this is one of those movies where you just need to accept that somehow it all works, and then you can lose yourself in it.

However, other movies in this group don't usually pretend to have a deep-going story. ""The Cell"" did, and that made it really painful to watch.Please forget all the crap you've heard about ""diving into the soul of a serial killer"": This movie was about as profound as an episode of ""Beverly Hills 90210"", in spite of all the suggestive imagery.Music video director Singh has not (yet?) learned one of the fundamental rules of film-making: That the pictures should tell a story, not the story tell some pictures.Summary: Unless you're one of the folks who'll like to drool over Jennifer Lopez' bare thighs, you should consider spending your money on something worthwhile.",The Cell

The characterization of everyone in the film, including the crazed killer who is the focus of all the mind-trotting, are as thin as they come.

If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. And there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. While I feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, I find it to be completely fascinating.Right from the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her ""patients"", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. The camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. If you don't enjoy anything else about ""The Cell"", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.The casting is top notch also. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is fairly convincing as an FBI agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. It's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance from an underrated actor.While ""The Cell"" doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.",The Cell
263,DumaNV,Eicher Meets Michael Parks,6,14 September 2000,Visually this film is stunning.  If you like the works of the surreal artists Eicher and/or Michael Parks then you will be treated to the combination of both.  The real-life sequences vary from basic to repulsive with some images that will stick with you (body piercing is now re-defined in my vocabulary!) but it is the `dream' sequences that are the viewable part of the movie.  Dump the acting and the plot.  The acting is average and the plot is predictable.  The dialogue is sophomoric.  Hold out for the DVD or video.,The Cell
264,K N,Not a lot of substance but great imagery!,7,18 August 2000,"I really think that Ebert should start thinking twice before he throws out another one of those ""best movie of the year"" comments! It certainly does not apply to this movie. The plot is so plain and uninteresting that all the eye-popping and colorful artsy visuals cannot save it. I didn't find the movie pretentious or unrestrained, it's just that there's hardly anything deep to say about it at all. It was fun to watch, but definitely not satisfying to the thinking man.",The Cell
265,slinky-8,Dull Story with CGI Graphics,2,25 December 2000,"What made Silence of the Lambs such a great movie is what made this movie so terrible. Silence has a terrifying villain, a mystery that is far from uncovered, you get to know more about the villain and the mystery, the interplay of the characters, the mystery unraveling... very cool, very interesting. The lack of CGI effects made the directors of Silence focus on a compelling movie and script. Unfortunately, not true for this utterly boring piece of tripe which seems like the directors thought they could provide a cheap rip off and just add CGI effects. Even assuming she could (and it doesn't seem like she is that good) Jennifer Lopez doesn't even have a chance to act in this silliness. Some that do are terrible. You are set up with an overly gory compilation of bad deeds done by a supposedly terrifying villain and the rest is a major draw out with some decent/commonplace CGI effects to discover what you knew completely in the first few minutes of this stupid film. At the end you are saying to yourself ""so what? I've heard Lawnmower Man 2 also went nowhere.""",The Cell

So impressed that I had to buy it when it came out on DVD.  It also didn't help that my wife wanted it because of Vince Vaughn either.  I was certainly glad to see that the transfer to DVD was done so that all the colors that I saw on the big screen showed up very well on the smaller screen.  The Cell is about a psychiatrist who has to help the police locate a missing girl by going ""into the mind"" of the kidnapper who is in a coma.  The idea that was used to enter his mind was done wonderfully and is sometime tough to figure out was is really happening but I love it when that happens. Vincent D'Onofrio is stupendous as the psycho killer/kidnapper and Jennifer Lopez is not bad as the psychiatrist.  This movie is also at times very creepy.The only downside to the DVD is the audio commentary.  I tried listening to it and about fell asleep.  The director is very boring and most of the time it is hard to understand him.  All in all I give this 7-10 stars.",The Cell

The things it does well, it does REALLY WELL, and the things that it does badly, it does REALLY BADLY. It's sad because it could have been a masterpiece. What was great: the cinematography, the imagery, the acting (absolutely phenomenonal), and the overall plot (which was ruined by the awful writing). What was terrible: the script, the writing, and the way the plot is haphazardly and unnaturally constructed. Everything seems so contrived and unnatural. For example, it's way too convenient that the killer has this Seizure thingy and goes into a coma on the same day they come to arrest him, it's way to convenient that somehow the doctor just happens to know off the top of his head of a research laboratory that does inception-like crap and can help them figure out where the girl is being held, it's way too convenient that he has the water sprinklers in the cell set on automatic so that it can fill up without him there, adding to the suspense and time sensitivity of the situation, it's so obvious the connection is made between the killer having a suspension fetish and then when they do their inception-like stuff, they're similarly suspended, it just feels way too forced, and the kid, Edward, had the same type of rare schizophrenia as the killer dude? Come on. This movie is very disappointing, not because it's bad, but because it could have been one of the most amazing movies of all time right up there with Inception, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Memento, Seven, the Butterfly Effect, Donny Darko, Being John Malkovich, the Fountain, the Jacket, Clockwork Orange, and a few more that I am forgetting, movies that are perched front and center on the shelf of any trippy, psychological thriller, mind-bending movie fan. Instead, this movie goes in the pile of beautiful disappointments, kind of like the brilliant child that always disappoints their parents, not because they're a bus driver making an honest living, but because everyone knows that kid could have been president.",The Cell
269,DocFilm,Gorgeous visuals compromised by attempted plot,7,12 September 2004,"The rings on the villain's back must be for a willing suspension of disbelief. The plot and dialog are contrived, intrusive, absurd. We are told that the villain's ""schizophrenia"" is due to the adult manifestation of symptoms of a childhood cerebral viral infection, yet we are shown the story of a compulsive reenactment, with role reversals, of childhood abuse -- perhaps another example of the popular confusion between schizophrenia and ""split personality."" Even the directing and editing have their problems: the good guys are very leisurly in real-time considering that every minute counts to save the victim.Turn off the sound, fast forward through the psycho-babble, and watch the visuals. As with ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett, the visual drama of this film is wonderful (""Elizabeth"" was also directed by a South Asian, Shekhar Kapoor, and Tarsem Singh's ""Cell"" is more obviously influenced by Mughlai miniatures, decoration, and Bollywood).",The Cell

The curiosity value increases further with this being his debut. The movie is about entering the mind of a psychopath to rescue one of his potential victims, using a VR-like sci-fi method. The story itself is uncomplicated, but what sets it apart are the stunning visuals.
Art direction, cinematography, special effects and editing shed their boundaries and merge to provide something not really viewed before. In the twisted mind of a schizophrenic, everything cannot be pleasant though. The background score is suitably haunting. The acting is just fine. Singh seems to have fully understood the power of the medium and takes over the proceedings. Another notable aspect is the absolute dearth of Hollywood formulae. When the movie ends, one gets the feeling of leaving an alternate world and it also sets off a thought process.",The Cell

Both were accomplished in this movie.The locating of the hiding place and the suspense involved in finding it in time, and the trips into the minds of the killer and the boy by psychological team were at various times kept separate and finally combined all in breakneck speed.The dream sequences or invasions into the subconscious were both visually and intellectually stimulating. The fact the Lopez' character had to be submissive while visiting but in control while hosting gave greater plausibility to the entire concept. The actors were perfectly cast. Lopez showed sensitivity in her role. The various doctors and agents were believable in their roles. But the star of the movie was Vincent D'Onofrio. He continues to amaze in his ability to do many different kinds of roles in an exceptional manner.
The director kept things simple in the real world and contrasted them in the torture tank and the dreams so that the emotional roller coaster kept going to the end.This movie should be seen for the effects and for D'Onofrio's performance, not just for the Jennifer Lopez fans.",The Cell

(This was just the beginning.) Somewhere soon though I realized this was just a piece of self-indulgent crap. I really feel the director is not a really smart person-just like me. But, don't we want smart people like Steven Speilberg, or Spike Lee, or Soderbergh, etc to direct the movies we watch. All the effort Singh put in to this is such a waste of time, his and mine.

Then I came across of couple of reviews that rated this film as one of the year's best!  Perplexed, I decided to see this movie.I thought it was great.  I think a lot of the negative reviews were due to the disturbing subject matter, and also because the director got his start in music videos (for some reason that's considered a bad thing by some folks).  Anyway, the visuals in this film were simply jaw-dropping. I particularly enjoyed the opening sequence -- its combination of desert imagery and weird but effective music really set the tone for this film.Most movies these days suffer from poor endings, but this one didn't.  The well-crafted screenplay set up a multi-layered climax that wrapped up the film nicely.  And I thought the acting was good throughout.  This movie is not for everybody.

The heart of the movie is the pure visual appeal and the stunning assault on the senses it creates.  The director was constantly using the full frame of the film as an artist might use a canvas.

Lovely. Not one of the better story lines of that year, in my opinion. Though if it were it would have been a waste, as the people behind this film are clearly not adept at storytelling; the story carried as it is by uninteresting characters and almost completely banal dialogue. What the film does offer is arresting, unique and inventive imagery. Indeed, there is enough of it in the final half hour to merit at least one viewing of the film.

So therefore, he is a talented director.",8,2 March 2011,"***1/2 out of ****So many films promise the cinematic acid trip of a life-time; the seductive visual excitement that no other film can possibly present to you. Few follow up on their promises, but I have many times before enjoyed a good visual trip. But is it right to adore a film for its visual craft alone? Maybe. But when it has the kind of substance that only a select few will see, then there's much reason for one to like it. I am referring to a film such as ""The Cell"". This magnificent piece of cinematic eye-candy is some of the best I've seen in a while, and for quite some time this particular sense of whimsy remains consistent. This certainly helps the film a lot, since director Tarsem Singh, professionally known only by his first name, seems to have the born skill of artful filmmaking. You may not agree with me on my opinion, but I think ""The Cell"" is a mighty fine movie. It exists to thrill the audience with its visuals, and by all means it succeeds. I found myself captivated whenever Tarsem's unique and stunning visuals were on-screen, but a little bored when they weren't. This gives me a chance to say that while it's still wonderful and suitably grand on the visual scale, ""The Cell"" is not perfect. There were some points in the film's story where I felt more narrative detail was needed, and then, as I mentioned, there were times when the lack of amazing eye-candy really hurt the film's entertainment value. None the less, these are the kind of flaws I can easily forgive. I'm perhaps too forgiving of a film like this, but I'm not going to lie; I really enjoyed it. This is one of 2002's more unique films, if not one of its overall best. ""The Cell"" has none the less made me want to see more out of Tarsem, and it's also made me re-evaluate Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn as actors/actresses. Both have had their good days, and then their bad days, but this is one of those times where a director can master them to the best of their ability. This is a great film and Tarsem is a great director. It's not a movie that will appeal to just anyone, but then again what are visually trippy, wholesomely satisfactory cinematic films for? This is what I believe to be the work of a man who has alas been misunderstood by many. If you can look past some of the obvious plot flaws, then you'll most likely enjoy the ""trip"" while it lasts. It's not a film for everyone; some think of it as pretentious, overly-ambitious, and even boring. I think it's a pretty darn good film. And if it means anything, I suppose that counts for something.

True, there have been some interesting twists to the basic format in this movie, but the Matrix puts them to shame. BUT! Don't get me wrong, i was not once bored by this film. The plot may have been less than amazing, but the cinematography and the convincing performances more than made up for that. This has to be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.

The visual and audio effects were astounding as they manipulated my mind and kept me on the edge of the realization that I was watching somebody's inner sanctum.Although at times the plot made me reel back and start to critique the movie with large amounts of cynicism, I thought that the originality of the movie made up for its obviousness in its destination.  I was impressed with the paralleling of scenes, and the lengths the movie went to express the effects of human cruelty.As for the acting, Jennifer Lopez is not something to write home about. However, I believe her character was straight forward and without much depth so it did little to hinder the movie.  Vincent Vaughn had a few moments to impress, and I thought did a commendable job of straying away from his former characters in movies like Swingers.

Sick and crazy - as it should be.The characters were simple, because most people are simple. Catherine and Peter never got together, because that's what normally happens.

And despite Jennifer Lopez's, at times surprisingly respectable, lead performance in this latest addition to the emerging 'Philosophy of Mind' sub-genre of SciFi films (: Matrix, Dark City, Existenz,), Tarsem (Duamdwar Singh)'s ""disturbing, twisted, gnarled, and truly unique"" first vision is too loose in its narrative qualities to be compared to those major films.While highlighting some interesting issues concerning future therapeutic possibilities (and the dire psychological dangers !) of interactive virtual-reality technology, the ""ambiguous"" stance this film takes towards today's materiality, in our ""Prozac world"" of a contemporary behavioralist medical science, while plundering archetypal, awesome visual effects from a Freud/Jungianist spirituality, within the ""dark sides"" of a child schizophrenic's, a serial killer's, and a child therapist's Id's, was just too disconnected to work well. It is, however, a film interesting enough to recommend; if for no other reason than state-of-the-art cinematography of fantastic imagery from those ""dark sides.""Vincent D'Onofrio's performance bears the mark of a gifted actor stunningly capable of the serial- killer/psychopath roles; that is, of one who has gained the immeasurable benefit of having worked with THE director who'd bring out all the craft of any actor's talent : Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket). The subtle homage to David Lynch's Twin Peaks (""Mares eat oats and does eat oats"") WAS a notable insider flourish. Unfortunately, the contemporary 'Hollywood' use of what I refer to as the 'non-casual introduction of recreational drug use to signal an imminent dramatic mental state' did not suffice to effectively mark an interesting possibility for fuller character development; i. e.,  Lopez's ""therapist"" role vis-à-vis the under-developed character of Vince Vaughn's ""FBI agent.""Moral, possibly judicial, concerns surrounding the dubious ethics of new liberties inherent to our therapist's (Lopez's) enhanced  technological ability, most specifically in the 'spiritual' act of that freedom she takes, to virtually exercise a real and effective ""mercy killing,"" as euthanasia without any repercussions - in what could only be construed as the metaphysical 'redemption' of the child-like innocence of an immortal soul - is perhaps the most compelling aspect of a merely visual film.

290,Matt-33,The Cell vs. Thomas Harris,8,23 August 2000,"Let me first start off by saying that I enjoyed ""The Cell"" very much.  The special effects were amazing, and the cinematography was astounding.  But as I was watching the film, it reminded me of Thomas Harris's novels:  ""Red Dragon"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Hannibal"". It seemed to me that the story line for ""The Cell"" was a futuristic compilation of these three novels.I'll start first with characters:  Catherine (Jennifer Lopez) seems very much like Agent Clarice Starling.  Both are unexperienced in their field, but have a particular gift for the job they are performing.  Both of them are plagued by nightmares.  Detective Novak (Vince Vaughn) is similar to Will Grahm of ""Red Dragon."" Both have a similar empathy with the killers and victims they are pursuing.And then there's Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio).  Who seems to me to be a combination of all three villians:  Francis Dolarhyde, Jame Gumb, and Hannibal Lecter.  Dolarhyde (Red Dragon) has a split personality and has a disfigured face.  Dolarhyde's has a powerful personality known as the Red Dragon who wants to eliminate the weaker personality.  Carl has multiple personalities and has steel rings in his back (self-inflicted disfigurement).  Carl also has a powerful personality, and we get the feeling that this personality wants to control the other ones.  Jame Gumb (Silence of the Lambs) treats his victims as objects.  He wants to be a woman so he kidnaps women and skins them in order to make a real ""girl suit.""  After he's through with the bodies, he throws them in a river.  Carl also treats his victims as objects, in this case:  dolls.  Carl also throws his bodies in rivers.  Hannibal Lecter is very similar to the ""Super Personality"" that resides in Carl's mind.  In ""Hannibal"" there is a scene where we enter (symbolically) Hannibal Lecter's mind.  He find that he structures his mind as a castle, and has perfect memory in order to conjure at will any fact.  Carl's mind also seems like a castle, and we are able to see his different memories and dreams.  Hannibal Lecter likes to kill his victims based on literature.  For example:  he made one victim look like ""Wound Man"" a medieval anatomy drawing.  When Carl tortures Novak (Vince Vaughn) by pulling out is entrails, we see later that Carl got the idea from medival torture techniques.Plot: The scenes where Catherine enters the mind of Carl seems very much like Clarice Starling interviewing Hannibal Lecter.  Both are using their time with the madmen in order to learn the whereabouts of a missing girl.  Both Jame Gumb and Carl keep their victims confined in an unique way.  Gumb keeps his women in a well that is in his basement, and Carl keeps his in an air tight cage.  Both Gumb and Carl were ""speeding up"" there patterns.  Every time they kidnapped a women it was sooner after their last one every time. The detectives said that when the killers first started it was months in between kidnappings, and their cycles where getting shorter every time.I'd like to say that this idea is just my thoughts and is pure speculation. I enjoyed ""The Cell,"" and I hope you find this comparison interesting if you agree with it our not.",The Cell
291,Lofwer,Oh the sadness that comes with wasted opportunities,4,21 August 2000,"This could have been a really interesting, possibly great movie, but it is not.  Not by a long shot.  This movie is an empty, pretentious piece of garbage.  Beautiful imagery flows by, but none of it has any meaning. Characters are hollow.  Some would say they are simple, archetypal figures. I would say that they're shells, non-characters parading around AS characters with flimsy back stories and lame characterization devices.  The exploration of a serial killer's mind is handled with exactly the type of smug pop psychology that marks only the worst films of the genre.  It would have been more interesting if first time director Tarsem Singh had explored the morality of invading a person's mind.  But there is none of that. There are no grand themes, there are no real ideas being explored here.  The story is just a rickety excuse to show lots of purty pictures.  Someone should tell Tarsem that purty pictures don't mean a thing if there is nothing behind them.  People have compared this film to 2001, Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club.  THey've compared Tarsem to a burgeoning figure amongst filmmakers, on par with Fincher, PT ANderson, Jonze, and worst of all, Stanley Kubrick.  THis is ludircous, and quite insulting to those genuinely talented people, those genuinely inspired films.  This is garbage. Jennifer Lopez is terrible, purring every line like she's in a cheap 80s video porno.  Vince Vaughn looks like a drunken lout slumming as an actor.",The Cell
292,spacelord,"Great visuals, Little Else",5,26 June 2001,"I must admit that I was looking forward to seeing The Cell. It had an intriguing premise and the trailer looked promising. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. The Cell has great visuals and little else. While its premise is original, the plot itself is by the book. The script lends little depth to the characters, so the actors cannot really be blamed if they do not give their best performances. Over all, I would say that one should only see The Cell if one is really into photography and great images. If you want a good movie, go elsewhere.",The Cell

294,kilgres_bloodmoon,A Dance in the Mind of Madness,9,18 August 2000,"This film is simply amazing as both a story and as a visual wonderland. The entire film is a long, brutal dance with evil that is ever-present, but always a bit untouchable.     ""The Cell"" has forever changed my opinion on first-time directors, as I now view Tarsem Singh as one of two things: 1) A madman with flashes of brilliance or, 2) A brilliant director who has been lost in the world of music videos and commercials. He truly could be one or the other. The outcome of his first foray into major film direction is a breath of fresh air blown directly into the lungs of a disappointing summer crop stagnating with useless special effects and jokes involving anal cavities.     As far as plot goes, this one has it in spades. ""The Cell"" is actually three stories at once, intertwining seamlessly (albeit through the use of jump cuts, which I'm not too fond of)into one frightening journey. The time is the near future. Jennifer Lopez (in a surprising turn toward competent acting) plays Catherine Deane, a child therapist who has volunteered to help a comatose boy escape his neverending dream by linking to his inner mind. She does this by utilizing new technology which allows her to enter the boy's world. But this is not the problem. At the same time, a serial killer has recklessly dumped the body of a young girl in a shallow stream. Using slim clues, the FBI captures him, but only after a freak aneurysm brought on by acute schizophrenia renders him permenently comatose. Enter the new technique.     What follows, as the FBI races to discover the latest girl the killer has condemned to death, is an absolute masterpiece of cinematography and visual effects. The world inside the mind of the killer (played by a vicious Vincent Donofrio) is like a mix of Salvador Dali's paintings and German S&M theater. Lopez, aided by a nervous but focused Vince Vaughn, delves into the the darker corners of the killer's delusions, which are stalked by a dark, majestic being that represents the killer's dark side.     My hat is off to the director, screenwriter and cinematographer of this film. They deserve several oscar nominations, and some wins as well.",The Cell

This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.' Definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape. It won't be half as good on tape.This movie is not for the easily freaked out. It will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget.

Nowhere near as hard as The Matrix or Inception or The Clockwork Orange, so if you get those then you'll have no issues here...With regards to gore/horror I just don't get those reviews and it's laughable 😂
The film is no way near as bad as most horror or slash horrors... If you've seen Saw or Final Destination or even let's say Blade?

299,JonL-2,"Good Eye candy, flat script and flat acting",6,3 September 2000,"I went to The Cell with the expectation of amazing SFX sequences, which it delivers. I won't give up the plot becuase it's already been done here. Safe to say a mild ""Silence of the Lambs"" meets ""Dune"" meets H.R. Geiger.The creepy ""Seven"" imagery and herky-jerky cuts owes as much to the animation of The Quay Brothers as it does to the grotesque photography of Joel Peter Witkin. Unfortunately even the eye-candy imagery and effects can't save this plodding bore of a thriller. Predictable and uneffective script is only worsened by the flat delivery of the dialogue. It may not be the actor's fault (at least not Vaughn's and D'Onofrio's). I don't know how good of an actor Lopez is as I have never seen ""Selena"", but she kind of whiny, whimpering in her lines. I also noticed that Lopez keep a good heavy layer of lip gloss going in her ""reality"" character. I wonder if that helps her out when she's suited up in that rubber suit suspended from the ceiling while psychoanalyzing the killer? One other thing, this film has some rather gruesome images and I wouldn't recommend this for young teenagers or little children, even with the presence of pop ""diva"" Lopez. I am always surprised when I see parents dragging their little kids to films like this. And of course today, I saw no less than 3 small children (10 or under) at this film with parents.

301,Kiwinick,The most disgusting film I have seen in ages,1,19 January 2001,"Although this film is supposedly a psychological thriller about what goes on in the mind of serial killer It is nothing more than a disgusting, voyeristic, pornographic tour of the torture of a woman and the abuse of a child.  I don't say that the film is pornographic because of any nudity or sexual imagery (although there was plenty of the latter).  No, I call it pornographic because we are supposed to sit in our comfortable chairs, happily munching on popcorn, and watch as one young woman suffers by slowly drowning, and another is tortured with drowning, and while a small child is beaten and maimed: this is sadism as entertainment, and I think that the casual display of violence in this way is far more destructive and immoral than any nakedness or sexual activity.  The fact that in this film the violence is sexualised, with young women made out to be dolls and placed in provocative poses highlights my characterisation of the film as pornographic.  At the beginning of my piece, I said that this film is intended to be a ""psychological thriller"".  Well, it isn't.  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the woman in ""The Cell"" will be rescued (or by whom), or if Jennifer Lopez's character will ""come back"" from the killer's mind then you should be in a half-way house, as you will be unable to care for yourself in a modern society.  There is no tension.  There is no examination of anyone's motives or character (with the sole exception of the killer, and even in this case, the only purpose of the examination of his mind is to titillate, not to enlighten).  I cannot understand what merits this film displays apart from the artfulness with which it is shot.  This in itself is not (or should not be) an excuse to display abuse and torture. Those who took part in this film, particularly those who funded it, shame. To those who watched and were not sickened... remember (or indeed learn about for the first time) Kitty Genovese, the woman murdered in front of 38 witnesses, none of whom did anything to help her (not even call the police). Can we really watch very realistic torture scenes such as those constructed for this film and not feel sickened?  I hope not.",The Cell

There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.

307,Sutek_The_Mad,"Cells, tissues, organs...all in this one!",6,4 November 2001,"I had the occasion to view The Cell a little while ago and I must say it was probably one of the more interesting films I have been to.  I left the theatre feeling a little sick to my stomach simply because the plot was so disturbing in its conception.  The Cell, a mix between a psychological thriller and a full-blown horror film is bound to pique your interests one way or the other.  It truly has a wealth of lavish and intensely creative visual effects that draw the patron into the film.mind, body, and  spirit. The plot is relatively mundane in its entirety.  It focuses on Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a charismatic social worker who does not happen to be on the local county payroll.  She is happy making a living by hooking herself up to a machine, which in all honesty is capable of probing the symbolic and often surreal minds of unsuspecting subjects.  I found that the notion of mind probing pretty far fetched, but once the movie starts, you are too captivated by the visuals to worry about the scientific probability of such a machine actually working. Catherine Deane literally infiltrates the mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) and becomes a puppet in his sick and often very disturbing mind.  From the moment she enters the mind of the killer it is as if she has been plopped right into the middle of a terrifying nightmare. The mind of the killer (the setting) is creepy and disturbing, but all the while it is truly enticing and beautiful.  They creators of this movie had a keen ability to bring to life the eerie preoccupations of a sexual abuse victim gone serial killer and they were able to translate his inner suffering through gorgeous costumes, bizarre and lavish settings, and truly ingenious computer aided graphic design. Overall, the script is shoddy at best and lacks any life whatsoever.  The tacky interaction between characters rivals the interactions between the two Disney chipmunks, but I suppose Jennifer Lopez makes it up with her aesthetically pleasing body.   However, if you can get through the dialog, or the lack there of, you will be fine.  The visual effects give this movie its true power.  Otherwise, it would be a pathetic attempt at renewing an already exhausted genre of serial killer movies like Copycat or Seven. I would recommend this movie to everyone, even if you are turned off by the `psy-horror' films.  It is certainly worth the outrageous price of $6.75; all the same, if you are low on cash, it would be just as good as a renter.just not as terrifyingly real as it was in the theatre.",The Cell

The imagination seems to have been spent solely on the graphics, artwork and other sick representations of a twisted mind . *Spoiler*(That thing with the guys nipples being torn out was way unnecessary).While J.

So you'd think that the plot and the script (especially the script) would reflect that.   But no, no it doesn't.   The plot does allow for very interesting twists and very VERY cool special effects and moments of suspense, but I think it could've gone deeper and done more.   Luckily, however, the script fades during the second half and just gives you the necessary information.   The visuals are astounding and absolutely beautiful.  I wouldn't be surprised if The Cell walked away with best costumes and best visual effects at the Oscars.If you're looking for a suspenceful movie that's fun to watch, than I definitely recommend The Cell.

311,Sean Arc,Another 'computer-simulated vitual-reality world' film- yet entertaining.,8,26 August 2000,"The idea of entering a killer's mind to find out where he keeps his trapped victim is interesting yet not totally original.  The movie in some ways makes you think of The Matrix or The Thirteen Floor.  Their plots are different but their main idea is similar- a computer-simulated virtual-reality world that is not real. The Cell shows an interesting point: The audience feels the killer must be punished for his crimes yet as we explore the killer's childhood we begin to understand his motive to the things he had committed.  The movie shows us that even though the man is a killer in his manhood he was not necessary bad when he was a kid.  Conducted by the pain and suffering he went through his childhood he became the man he is. But, since the kid and the man are the same person, when the man is being hurt, the kid will also be hurt. I cannot say Jennifer Lopez gives an outstanding performance but she does give a decent one. Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio are well-admired actors by myself and I enjoyed their performances.

However, the acting and plot are downright average.  If you are looking for a great show and a good scare, watch this.  The only disappointment is that it is a little TOO graphic, making it seem like a cheap horror B-movie.

Jennifer Lopez enters the mind of the killer, and guess what she finds ? Well, a lot of strange things . Demons, literally and help them get killed. And in the process saves a would be victim. And what made the director think Jennifer Lopez was the right person for this role ? Not that she acts badly.

314,Qale-2,The Cell has no heart.,2,20 August 2000,"Directed by a guy who's won awards for music videos, ""The Cell"" does for the big screen what music videos do for the little: Pushes the visuals to the extreme man!  Hell, Jennifer Lopez, who stars as a child pyschologist, is even asked to carry the film's sane side and she's been in several wicked music videos.  Nothing had prepared her for this though.And I'm not really talking so much about the darkness that comprises the entire been there, done that enter-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer plot.  I'm talking about the world of acting where one may need to reach inside oneself and not worry so much about how they look when they give their performance.Since I did mention the dark as sin plot, I guess I should go ahead and admit to walking out of a scene where viewers get to participate in the violent fantasy visuals that comprise the reasoning behind why the pyscho killer is indeed a pyshco.  What can I say?  I can't stand to watch boys being so brutally harmed, be it real or fake.  Others will object to the pyscho's sexual fixation on making his victims doll-like.  It becomes obvious very quickly that the film doesn't know how to keep viewers thrilled, intrigued, and visually stimulated without disturbing a majority of moviegoers at the same time.While a movie can survive without being for everybody, it cannot survive if it has basic problems with it.  Over characterization of the one person you can't stand to hear another thing about, selling out reality by having most of the movie occur in a place where anything goes because it's not real, the odd attempt to victimize the antagonist even to the point of romanticising him, and finally diluting the idea on who the real victim is. Is it the girl who's trapped in his torture device, I don't know anything about her.  Is it Jennifer Lopez trapped inside the mad man's head, I don't know anything about her, really.  Is it the cop?

Lopez is top child therapist Catherine Deane, whose sessions are held inside the client's brain using new technology. While helping her latest client, a young boy named Edward, has proved difficult, Catherine gets a new challenge when she's hired by the FBI to go into the mind of a schizophrenic serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, twice as creepy as he was in ""Full Metal Jacket"") to find out where he's hiding his latest victim. Vince Vaughn plays the hardened prosecutor-turned-FBI agent assigned to the case, Peter. The characters aren't fully developed, and some intriguing questions the film asks aren't properly addressed. We learn at the beginning of the film that Catherine has been having trouble sleeping and has nightmares, but nothing further in the story explains why this could be so. After her first trip inside his mind, Catherine learns that D'Onofrio's killer was physically and sexually abused as a child, and she and Peter discuss whether a childhood of abuse is an excuse for, or always leads to, abusing others in adulthood. ""The Cell"" brings up this question but doesn't sufficiently examine it. Beyond her strong compassion for others, we learn little about Catherine, and Peter, who ditched his career in the D.A.'s office after a dangerous child molester was allowed to walk, even less. While Peter's story is obviously an indictment of the U.S. judicial system, the film's themes of childhood abuse and trauma and its effects as well as schizophrenia could be more developed for a stronger film.

We're than introduced to a rather run of the mill psychopath who likes to torture his victims etc, etc...tedium ensues. Interspersed throughout this bland Law & Order murder mystery are several journeys through the psyche of this schizophrenic madman. Now, this is what I came here to see.

318,carlacryptic,"High art which is also entertaining, psychotherapy which is accessible",10,1 November 2005,"I view this film as one of the best psychological thrillers to have ever been made. It is gorgeous to look at, as seductive as beauty in and of itself can be, but it is also both seductive and satisfying intellectually. Jennifer Lopez has proved herself to be a woman who can portray strength, sensitivity, beauty, and intelligence well, appealing to both men and women at the same time. In this role, she is intellectually and emotionally stronger than she is physically - as a therapist, she has to be, and it is as a therapist that she wages war with her patients' enemies and, when lucky and stubborn enough, doesn't just win a few battles. I liked seeing a good role model for this kind of struggle on the big screen. (In another of Lopez' films, Enough, we see the other side of this, where the battle being waged is both necessary and physical, and I think these two films would make a great double feature. :)I have friends who won't watch this film through to the end no matter how much I encourage them. The film is scary and unsettling at a level which is deep enough to put many people off. If, however, you don't watch to the end, you miss one of the most transcendent sequences in film, one which more than makes up for the route by which it is achieved. More importantly, it's my opinion that we shouldn't shy away from the worst that we are capable of and, instead, should focus our most intense light on it. That's the only way I can see to alter and/or mediate the things which happen which make us afraid, which haunt us, which diminish us. Instead of the simplistic battle of good versus evil, this film tackles the complex battle of healing psychological scars which, along with chemical/hormonal triggers, have created a monster. It's the battle of separating out what is human and reachable from what is inhuman and untouchable in a single mind tortured by the dichotomy. It is the battle of modern life, where there are no clearcut white hats and black, where complexity is unavoidable, and where dealing with people entails dealing with your own demons as well as theirs.But, also, if you are scared or upset by the early stages of the film, you owe yourself the healing and succor of its resolution. This film gets deep into your psyche and stirs things up, especially if you've experienced any of the realities it is trying to reveal. But, especially if that's the case, you owe it to yourself to let the film work its artistic magic on your psyche as it finds a way to heal the various characters it portrays. They are very creative solutions and worth adding to your personal arsenal against whatever bumps in the night of your unconscious mind.The brilliance of the cinematography, direction, musical score, and acting is that, as beautiful and riveting as they all are, they take a back seat to telling the story. If you take the time to watch the various extras on the DVD version, you will not be sorry. For me, it was thrilling to find out how much the hundreds of people, all artists in their own fields, working on the film got to stretch and grow in the experience. It's the kind of collaboration you hope for all of your life and only rarely get to realize. For that, alone, The Cell is wonderful in my eyes.Because I myself am a survivor and know how heady an experience watching this film can be for both people who have been victims (and I'm guessing also for those who have been victimizers), I recommend that people who have such backgrounds watch it with people they trust and/or in a safe environment. Or, if that can't happen, that there is someone you can talk to about the feelings which come up during and/or after the film. This is actually one of the few films which I feel could be used in clinical situations to help advance the healing of people who have these issues to deal with. There are scenes of violence and terror in this film which are evocative and get under your skin... but there are also scenes of transcendence, caring, and healing which are just as powerful if you can get to the last third of the film without turning it off first. :)As a thriller, it's a real roller coaster ride... as a work of art, it's unsurpassed... as an experience, it's fascinating and can be mind-altering. I highly recommend it.",The Cell

322,theo47,Here's a riddle for you...,3,18 August 2000,"Q: What do you get when you give a pretentious music video director a multi-million dollar budget and let him masturbate for 2 hours?A: ""The Cell"".All the talk is about the visions inside the serial killer's head, but we get the visions in the director's head instead -- laborious art pieces and nonsequitors that are tedious instead of meaningful, script be damned. This guy has obviously seen ""2001"" and ""Coma"" too many times. Not that the script is anything special -- it's right off the serial-killer-movie assembly line. The only thing more disheartening than the movie was the previews for all the OTHER serial killer movies we will have to endure this year. ""Se7en"" is the only worthy entry in this genre, taking a formula plot and turning it into an indictment of American life. Any nice moments in ""The Cell"" are wasted, as the movie is only interested in itself. The proof is in the scenes which are NOT in the fantasy world -- they are shot as dry and boring as possible. You can sense the director's impatience during these scenes, anxious to get back into the fantasy world so he can show off his stuff.Word of mouth should give ""The Cell"" an early death in theatres, which is what it deserves. Even a shot or two of The Posterior cannot redeem a sad exercise in directoral masturbation. Save your money -- and that goes for any Hollywood exec wanting to hire the director, too.",The Cell

326,marsman,"I won't say it's awful, but Waterworld doesn't look too bad anymore.",4,21 August 2000,"I can't believe how empty this film was. I was impressed with the performance by Jennifer Lopez only because I had VERY low expectations after I saw her performance in U-Turn. She seems to be a little better than she used to be, however still only manages a level of competence at the role that you might expect from William Shatner doing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, but I digress. The movie borrows heavily from most psychological thrillers you can name, in particular Silence of the Lambs.The only portions of the film that were not recipe were the internal aspects of the killer's mind. The failure of this concept is that, while visually impressive, the images aren't specifically detailed or abstract in any meaningful way. There is no useful symbolism employed in Carl's mind in the way of how the mind operates, or what Schizophrenia is like, or any representation of how they might solve their predicament. As such the movie seems very contrived and does not deliver suspense or thrills. All it delivers is a series of strange and meaningless images that are briefly interesting to view.Two more points: the soundtrack was one of the most painful to listen to since The Untouchables and possibly even before, furthermore, if ONE MORE film tries to mount tension by asserting the ""If your mind thinks you die, then you die in the real world."" premise, I'm going to walk straight out of the theatre.

It has a great premise (In order to save a serial killer's latest victim, they must go inside of his mind), but ultimately falls flat on it's face, causing the viewer to become quite frustrated.  The acting is sub-par, and the plot has a major hole the size of Texas, almost as if this is a b-movie with a big budget.  And much like Hollow Man, the film presents very interesting concepts, and fails to explore them to their fullest.  Another half hour of the mind sequences might have came close, but that is uncertain.

331,noitsme_habibi,Intense,9,18 October 2002,"-- (modified)Brilliant movie. I don't like Hollywood movies much, and was sceptical about the film my GF wanted - no, needed - me to see, knowing not much more about it than that it had big stars and was quite successful and some kind of thriller-thing - and that she wanted, no, needed me to see it. I understand why now.From almost the moment it started I was sitting on the edge of my seat, in one of the most anxious and intense movie experiences I've had. The visual brilliance helped, of course. But The Matrix - that other movie she really wanted me to see - was also visually stunning while stretching your suspension of disbelief - but only scratched at surfaces where this movie just pulled you to it and dragged you right down, to the murkiest depths.I thought it was believable (I already saw that most other reviewers didn't) - not the ""possibility of dying in somebody else's dream"" bit, but the story so inventively told through the gimmick, that of the terrified boy within the sick man, one daring out for help while the other snaps out in anger. 'The serial killers sickness as a prolonged cry of pain' is not exactly a novel idea for a story line, but The Cell tells it in a way that grips you, and it does so through the technical-visual brilliance of its bizarre angle. This guy is so sick that no regular 'playing out' of the traumatised-kid-within story would have been credible - only in the very depths of his mind can that kid be found and that the director thus decided - OK - that's where we'll literally go in the movie, then - is pretty impressive. That they stayed an uncomprimising course, going beyond the thriller suspense but not giving in to the temptation to have her succeed in 'rescuing' him in some happy end either, is, too. The film never gets sappy about the tragedy hidden inside the serial killers head. He is truly and irredeemably rotten, to the core - his violence is beyond the hysteric violence of anger and frustration, it is the studious obsessed violence of a person who's been corrupted, corrupted by terror. The film shows where the terror stems from, adds the why and how come, but without ever excusing him. It's the nightmare of every victim - that his/her assailant will succeed in corrupting him/her to the point where s/he isn't fit for life anymore. Spoilt goods. The films' serial killer is. The film stays consistent in this, refusing the viewer an easy exit into mercy or condemnation. She goes to her limits to where she understands him - but he still has to die.The cruelty of The Cell is no freak show. Nothing gratuitous about it, it's real enough - all over the place, in minds and lives transformed by pain. Some other reviewer lamented that, unlike The Matrix e.a., the film had nothing ""to say about the resilience and optimism of humanity"". Well no, and if you go to the movies for your prescription of hope & belief, this is the wrong one to go see - it has something to say about damage, and how the inner world of terrorized kids turn into nightmare landscapes. Instead of telling that story, this film decided to just show those landscapes. Succeeded. Very disconcerting.",The Cell
332,M. Brub,Extravagance visuelle,8,21 August 2000,"I would definitely recommend this movie for all those adepts of ""weird"" visuals out there (without going as far as recommending it to hard core David Cronenberg fans...) The serial killer storyline in itself is not as disturbing as David Fincher's ""Seven"" for instance(same thing goes for the acting), but the fact that the exceptional visuals are just as spectacular and elaborate (if not superior) as those found in the ""Matrix"", this, in my book, is worth the compliment ""The Cell"" deserves.  I very much enjoyed Vincent D'Onofrio's offering as the schizo serial killer (although I should possibly have researched if the very rare and peculiar form of schizophrenia he displayed was real or fictional before stating this unequivocally). Jennifer Lopez gave us better acting in Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight"".  As for Vince Vaughn, he was decent or ""égal à lui-même"" (nothing can be worse than his horrible performance in ""Swingers"").  Bottom line, the clever/elaborate visuals make this movie a must-see ""techno-fantasy"", not the plot.  For an intricate storyline in that specific genre, I recommend the Spanish ""Open your eyes"" with Penelope Cruz or any David Fincher film (especially ""Fight Club"" and ""The Game"") if you happen to be a Fincher fan (which I am).8 out of 10",The Cell

On the other hand we have Jennifer Lopez playing a psychologist that has spend 18 months trying to communicate with a billionaire's comatose son.So far, so good.The movie falls off it's tracks and just can't get back to speed after they take the killer into custody.To sum it up: take the best parts of Seven, The Matrix, and Altered States.

334,jeremykirk13,Like a music video without the music,6,10 September 2000,"In 1991, Jonathan Demme took us into the mind of a serial killer with `The Silence of the Lambs.'  In 1995, David Fincher showed the world that made a serial killer do what he does with `Se7en.'  In 1998, Gus Van Sant remade `Psycho' giving him the evil eye from audiences everywhere.  In the new thriller `The Cell' first-time director Tarsem Singh literally takes us on a tour of the surreal world that is a serial killer's psyche.  Jennifer Lopez stars as Dr. Catherine Dean, a psychotherapist who has a difficult task set before her by the FBI.  Using her state-of-the-art system that allows her to literally enter someone else's mind, she must travel through the mind of a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is in a coma and discover the location of his latest kidnapped victim.  As time grows shorter and shorter for the kidnapped girl, Dr. Dean begins to not only search for her, she tries to save the life of the serial killer himself who is also trapped with the demons of his own mind.Much like a music video without the music (Which is what `The Cell' ultimately becomes) this film is all visual and little substance.  The twisted visuals that Singh creates of the world in the murderer's head are absolutely breathtaking.  However, these visuals are so much the foreground of the film that when Dr. Dean is not inside the killer's mind, the story lags so much that we cannot wait for her to go back in.  And, as much as these visuals spark the imagination, they never actually hit that peak of apprehension that I feel Singh intended, that sense of angst that you felt every time Clarice Starling was in Dr. Hannibal Lecter's presence in `The Silence of the Lambs.'  It is almost as if Singh is toying with the audience, giving us a fleeting indication of how horrifying this world that Dr. Dean has put herself into can really be and then quickly pulling us away from it.  I am sure it looked good on paper, but the transfer to screen leaves nothing much to be desired and almost everything to the imagination. Singh also backs off when it comes to a subplot involving a small boy in a coma that Dr. Dean is trying to reach.  This boy talks of a `boogie man' that Singh hints at as being the same demon that plagues the mind of the serial killer, that this same evil spirit lurks somewhere inside everyone's 90% of the brain they do not use, yet nothing concrete ever comes of it.  We are only left to speculate at how disturbingly mind-blowing this film's meaning could have been.For what it is worth, the images seen in `The Cell' are some of the finest uses of camera work and set design in recent years.  However, once you have seen the first set of these visuals, the mystery behind them has already worn off, and one must look at the story.  Where films such as `The Matrix' and `Dark City' pick up their storyline after the incredible visuals have been established, `The Cell' slacks off making the capability of the film found only in what we see.  Though that is a very important aspect of a motion picture, it is something that can easily be found watching it on video with the mute button firmly pressed.  This is something that I am sure I will do if I decide to watch `The Cell' again.Grade: C >",The Cell

They are guaranteed escapes from reality that we all share, and we don't need psychedelic drugs to take us there. All we have to do is close our eyes and fall asleep. Our dreams can be vivid, or they can be sketchy. They can be based on what's familiar, or be total fantasies. They can be realms of happiness, or be chambers of horror. There is one thing, however, that we can all agree upon: dreams most certainly are mysterious.I've often wondered if dreams are much, much more than simply a means of purging and recharging the brain. Could our dreams be significant? Could they have meaning? Could we learn from them? Could they be applied to our waking lives and be advantageously used to, perhaps, help solve problems? And if so, could the opposite also be true? Could our dreams harm us, or even kill us? Are we resigned to be merely silent witnesses, forced to go where our dreams lead us, or could we be active participants in them?These questions have been explored in films before, most notably ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Dreamscape"" (both released in 1984) and ""The Matrix"" (1999). The best-selling author Stephen King explored these questions in ""The Stand"" (1978) and ""Insomnia"" (1994). Now, ""The Cell"" can be added to the list. All are based on the theory that within us lies an ability to control the direction, flow and outcome of our dreams...provided that we realize we are dreaming. Once we do, we'll realize we are not constrained by the rules and laws of nature. In dreams, we can create our own rules. In dreams, everything is possible.I believe that the cast of ""The Cell"" could not have been more perfect. Vincent D'Onofrio is phenomenal as Carl Stargher, a serial killer who's perhaps as tortured as his victims. I could not help but feel sorry for this man. He seemed to be ""made"" a murderer against his will by a combination of severe childhood abuse and a virus that destroyed his mind. Vince Vaughn is excellent as Peter Novak, a homicide detective consumed by frustration, exhaustion, and desperation. Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly good as the soft-spoken social worker/parapsychologist, Dr. Catherine Deane, who is as empathetic and courageous as she is beautiful. What unfolds is a compelling story of a race against time to save a killer's last victim...but incredibly, most of the action in this film takes place in the killer's mind. The cinematography, set direction and special effects are mesmerizing, both beautiful and horrific. The bottom line: ""The Cell"" is essentially a sojourn into the nightmarish world created by a sick and tortured mind.I have seen this film at least a dozen times since it's release, and each time I've noticed details that I'd somehow overlooked in the past.

Her experience in this method takes an unexpected turn when an FBI agent comes to ask for a desperate favor. They had just tracked down a serial killer named Carl Stargher, his way of life is to abduct women one at a time and place them in a secret area where they are kept for about 40 hours until they are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma, which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race against time to explore the twisted mind of the killer to get the information she needs, but Carl's damaged personality poses dangers that threaten to overwhelm her.The film is really creative and original on how a mind of a sadistic killer would look like, The film also is very specific with important details dealing with the situation of the film.I also believe that the possible message from the movie is, do not abuse your kids in any way, or they will grow up to become a sick crazy sadistic killer like the one in the movie.You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.",The Cell

Horrible acting from all involved, a laughable bad guy (where did the idiot costume designer get his wig anyway? Was it really a leftover from Dumb & Dumber?) drab sets, uninteresting characters, and about one cliche every second, interspersed with the kind of ugly visuals one gets in pretentious-artist rock videos.It's a real mind-bender of a film, and not in a good way. I've seen some bad films in my time - the Postman, Waterworld, ISHTAR, Battlefield Earth.... but even those films had a fragment of entertainment value (some more unintentionally than others) but this long-winded, self-sumg tribute to the director's ego was caried out with such sterile, all-knowning seriousness that any entertainment value it may have had, even in it's badness, was drained away.It was like a laundry list. I was actively calling the action play-by play. Oh, look! amongst all this horror, a pretty horse! Bet you a thousand bucks it's killed gruesomely in the next fifteen seconds. BANG! SLICE! All this film needed was a fruit-cart being toppled to give it the full ""overused drama cliche"" treatment.I could forgive the film's lack of original ideas, if it hadn't been so undeservedly smug about itself. Keeping in mind that this idea's been done to death a million times, and in far more entertaining films... Hell, even ""Dreamsacpe"" bothered to reinvent the idea, by tossing an attempt to assassinate the president into the mix.And as weird-out, trippy visual art films go, it's barely pale in comparison to a Terry Gilliam film - so it doesn't even win on that account. It's second-rate, rehashed trash - the visuals slipping back and forth between full color and gritty grim-filter drabness in a way that art-school dropouts have been wetting themselves to try ever since ""The Matrix"".I didn't bother to see the end of this stinker, because as I noted in the title of this review - this is the first film I have ever walked out of.

I would have loved to see Helena Bonham Carter in the roll.This is not your typical Hollywood film.  In parts it is an homage to David Lynch, in other parts it is more music video (ala Nine Inch Nails). 
In this summer of laughable films (Patriot, Hollow Man, Bless the Child) I feel quite comfortable recommending The Cell.I honestly believe that anyone who enjoys art-house films will enjoy this one.",The Cell

Yes, we've seen it before, style or substance.  Visual effects can cover up plot holes.  The movie deals with odd situations in dreams, with loads of surreal images.  Not one of those images had a purpose or any meaning.  If this movie was written well, you would have to look deep into the scene, find symbolic meanings for the surreal images and then marvel at the visual effects.  But no thought is needed for this trash fest, just sit back and watch a whole bunch of weird images that don't make any sense.  If you want a good movie that deals with people entering dreams and has weirdness for a reason, watch ""The City of Lost Children.""",The Cell

The Cell is disturbing, yet surprisingly good",8,17 September 2000,"I went to see this having read a number of reviews here in England that were not very favourable. This coupled with an IMDB user rating below 7 and the fact that the director specialised in music videos meant that I went to see The Cell without great expectations. I'm happy to say it far exceeded what I expected. I've seen the film described as a cross between The Matrix and Silence of the Lambs. This is quite an accurate appraisal. The Cell is an original horror movie - a rare beast these days. Originality is something I value highly in horror films and this is different to any horror movie you've ever seen.The character development of the Lopez character and agent Novak is rather lacking and some of the main questions the film is seeking to answer could have been given solutions on a more psychological level. This is not a classic movie or even a horror classic, but it's better than another slasher flick (ironic or otherwise!)Be prepared for some very disturbing, dark images. For me, much worse than anything Se7en or Silence of the Lambs had to offer. You need to steel yourself for this one, but it's worth the effort.",The Cell

I have a tendency to expect too much, especially in the case of this first time film forTarsem Singh. He had directed losing my religion, so Iknew he had an eye for the visually stunning, but I wantedthe story to be quality as well, which it most certainly was.Underneath the fantastic sensory experience that is thisfilm were some very real and raw expressions of developed character and plot. So seldom does a story jump out at us and present itself in full light in a film likethis. Usually it hides itself, darting in and out of specialeffects when a new device is necessary. Here, a masterfuldirector and a superb  screenwriter have managed to expose many facets of a complex idea and complex characters. This film walks a thin line between angel feathers dripping from heaven and the dark slithery thingsthat hide in the somewhere else, always aware of it's ownpurpose. The Cell is never cheap or contrived, and it presents the director's cultural heritage without dumbing itdown for a western audience. The imagery is intense because of its honesty.

354,rmic,"An interesting, and disturbing thriller, it lacks however....",8,18 August 2000,"I have seen many disturbing movies, as well as some movies that contain some rather frightening images.  This movie met both guidelines.  The idea of how they dive into the human mind at a subconscious level is indeed intriguing. However their methods lack.  Instead of going for a surreal method, or a method that only some can understand, they went for a stupidly understandable way of displaying the human psyche and subconscious thinking. I felt that the movie did not lack in directing, as it did script.  The director seems to be fully capable of making a much more emotionally complex movie.  However, with the script, he was incapable.  The acting was also only average.  You were left with several loose ends involving the characters, as well as you learned nothing of the two stars(Lopez & Vaughn). You knew nothing of their backrounds, their personalities, hobbies, etc. In that aspect, the movie lacked.  However, out of sheer beauty, the movie excels.  The director by far was the person who benefitted most from the release of this film.  The deeply dark, and disturbing imagery is brutally magnificent.  The colors and camera angles are also unbelievable.  The director, like David Fincher(Fight Club/Seven) was originally a director of music videos and commercials.  I feel that this sudden surge of new directors is a breath of fresh air in a dying industry.  Never have average movies looked so beautiful, and left with your nerves all shook up. Although this movie lacks in many aspects, I still feel that it is a worth while movie to see, it is somewhat insulting to the intellegence of movie buffs, but for the non-movie fanatic, this is a sure fire winner for a friday evening, even you fanatics should give it a try.",The Cell
355,bob.lindell,Not even mind bending visuals can make The Cell memorable,5,12 September 2000,"Continuing in the tradition of psycho shockers that Se7en started, The Cell forces reactions out of the audience with unimaginable (and unbelievable?) crimes, disturbing visuals, and satanic overtones.Jennifer Lopez does a believable job of delivering the lines that were written for her and can't be held responsible for the lack of character development, she does all she can to make us care about her, but in the end, we don't care enough to get to the edge of our seats. Her foray into the minds of others, as well as the whole ""if you die in your dreams, you die in real life"", is very much a rehash of Nightmare On Elm Street but with more disturbing scenes of child abuse.Some movies take you to a dark place so you can better understand it, some movies take you into a dark place to make you fear it, The Cell brings you into that dark place for recreation. You get the feeling that the movie was pieced together by a team of surreal artists who each were responsible for 10 minutes of the film; after their scenes were shot, a writer came in and tried to piece them all together. All the eye-candy is entertaining, but without a good flow, it's random images, a sort of slideshow that takes place during a plot that we've all seen done before.Something bad happened with the timing of the film also, maybe it peaked too early, or maybe it was just because the ending was so obvious, but by the time they got to the ending, it just didn't seem important. I'd bet $10 that the DVD release is going to have an ""alternate ending"" and ""added footage"" that didn't make it into the big screen version. It's possible that the ending was a scaled down version that would more appeal to the masses than the one originally intended, hopefully it will add something that makes us feel a little bit more about what happens in the end.(It was hard to write a review on this one, for the simple fact that it was so ""blah"". Most of the flashy visuals were shown in the previews and the story was a failure. It's hard to come up with anything constructive to say besides ""it was okay."")",The Cell

Otherwise, might I suggest you wait until it comes out on video or better yet, save the $3 and wait for it to air in HBO. Its sad to see such a promising concept killed by a poorly written script!

Enter Carl Stargher(Vincent D'Onofrio), a rather unconventional serial killer who drowns his victims and turns them into dolls. Paths are crossed when Novak relies on Deane to enter the psychopath's twisted universe in hopes of saving his last would-be victim.Basically what I liked about ""The Cell"" first of all because of the fact that I found the talented Miss Lopez's character to be a woman full of beauty, intelligence, compassion,... and having a constantly changing wardrobe.

362,kmarshall,Astonishing cinema; may be too far ahead of its time,9,23 July 2001,"It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has quite handily established himself with his first feature, which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema.The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a film.  As a thriller, it rises above most of its peers, with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere.  However, it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's jolting sense of terror.As with several recent films, I have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about The Cell; in defence of the film, I will address a few of these issues.  The plot appears to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from The Silence of the Lambs, it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision--simultaneously horrifying and wondrous--is presented to the audience, much in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters, Lecter and Starling.  While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of The Cell, and in the same breath, praise that of The Silence of the Lambs.My final concern is the mention of ""MTV style"" directing.  It pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques.  A camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events; angles, pans, colour adjustment, and so forth, are all used to their full extent in The Cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream-like state that could not have been otherwise achieved.  This is essential to the film, as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious.  If you simply want a series of static shots, stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether.That being said, The Cell is thoroughly entertaining, terrifying, and breathtaking in both its pacing and design.  Anyone who is able to look past the--perhaps uninspired, yet never dull--screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000.",The Cell

Well, now that I've actually viewed it I can state that the above statement is not entirely true. Firstly, the cinematography is otherworldly. The special effects, the lighting, the makeup, the costumes are all absolutely amazing. I cannot stress this fact enough. I knew that this movie was going to look excellent but my expectations on that matter were far exceeded. The interior of a schizophrenics mind is portrayed precisely how you would imagine his mind would look like. This entails very grotesque and bizarre moments that essentially make this movie. Secondly, I will admit that there is some poor dialog scattered throughout this film and there is some decidedly wooden acting (Mrs. Lopez can be thanked for that) but all in all the plot moves quickly and is intriguing, not too dissimilar to a taut episode CSI . It is the root that keeps this film in balance, so it does not stray into mere absurdity. The crime/thriller backbone plot (however, edge-of-your seat captivating it is) is merely a background for the real insanity that is the topography of the killer's mind. I think this movie did poorly when it was released because it did not have a proper audience that would come and see it but, none the less, I think most people who will give this criminally underrated movie a chance will enjoy it like I did.",The Cell

369,Rilkan,Should be on the AFI Top 100 list...,3,28 August 2000,"...of unbelievably disappointing movies.  I can't believe I shelled out 7 bucks to watch this bilge.  I was excited at first, thinking that it would be a souped-up ""Silence of the Lambs"" (which was great), and then I became even more anxious when I saw that Roger Ebert gave it one of his trademark ""Thumbs Up!"" and 4 stars to boot, so I thought it was safe to say that it has enough original content to possibly compete with ""Silence of the Lambs."" However, when I finally sat down in the theater and began to watch it, I was greatly disappointed with what I viewed.  Not only was ""The Cell"" a horribly done recycled plot...no, scratch that...it was like an aluminum can that someone crushed, spit on, thrown to the side of the road, and was then recycled by a good Samaritan attempting to clean up the streets.  Anyway, what I saw was a movie that was too intent on showing us disturbing images and vast environments done completely in CGI...true, some of these images were beautiful, I'll give it that, but, for example, the desert scene at the start pales in comparison to, say, Lawrence of Arabia, which, by the way did not need ""magical"" computer graphics to display stunning visual effects.Not only was Tarsem too intent on ""wowing"" us with fuzzy, dated visuals, he seemed to think that these would replace a solid plot.  I don't think so...in Stargher's subconscious, for instance, there were great scenes of strange and interesting things, but there was no in depth look at his mind. Even ""Being John Malkovich"" achieved at least some insightful looks at how the subconscious could be made up.  But, Tarsem again felt that visual effects would be a suitable substitute.  Also, the plot was very jumpy and shaky that I didn't know how some of the things happened.  I mean, half of the ""problems"" in the movie solved in about the time it takes me to yawn from boredom, and some of them are remedied from out of the blue.So, in conclusion, I must say that this movie was a big disappointment, but I'll admit that some of the scenes were impressive, and D'Nofrio's performance was excellent, but one actor and cool-looking special effects are not enough to make a good movie (look at ""Hollow Plot""--er, uh, ""Hollow Man"").

370,Terror X,"Great Visuals, good storyline, but lacks substance",2,25 August 2000,"The director apparently wanted to make a dark/light contrasting piece of artwork on the screen, which succeeded.  It was a beautiful piece of visual artwork but was not supported music, acting nor character development.The movie had potential with the visuals, story line, and Vincent D'Onofrio as the villain.  Vincent D'Onofrio was under utilized as an actor with few lines that were muffled and soft not lending to a shy man with under developed social skills.  Nor to a mysterious man who wishes to be anonymous.  The components to suggest these things are left to the viewer's imagination.  So Vincent D'Onofrio although gave a great performance he was under utilized.

I probably wouldn't have even seen the movie if my friend didn't offer to get me in for free (he works at the theater). So when we went in the theater I noticed that there was on;y about eight other people in the room with us, so I immediately figured that this movie was going to suck. As it turns out, this is actually I movie that I would have liked to have seen even if it wasn't free. I think if the advertisements were better and focused more on reality, which is where the majority of the movie takes place, and not in the sci-fi world of the cell more people would want to see the movie. I'm not going to tell you exactly what the movie is about, I think it's better if you learn that for yourself. I know that part is contradicting itself. I mean that since the advertisments are already out and you already show some interest in seeing this movie I think it would be more interesting for you if you have no clue what to expect. I'm just gonna stop there before I start to confuse myself. Oh yeah, that's another thing. the commercials are slightly, no, extremely confusing, but the movie is surprisingly easy to follow. So overall I gave this movie a 7/10 stars.

379,Elitist Thirst,The most underrated movie of 2000,8,24 February 2001,"My friend Michael has a nickname for this: ""Silence of the Matrix.""I, of course, disagree with him.  ""The Cell"" is a visionary masterpiece in every sense of the word.  I have always had a special fetish with movies about the mentally disturbed, but rather than rip off from Travis Bickle or Hannibal Lecter, Protosevich (the writer) has created a unique and, oddly, sympathetic monster out of this.  Carl Stargher is an animal and a slave to his impulses, but also to his past.Through a series of very strange journeys into Stargher's bizarre, sadomasochistic personality, we see the abuse he went through as a child and we empathize with him.  He hates the purity of the women around him and seeks to take it away, but at the same time cannot seem to so much as touch it, so he takes their lives instead.  His entire attitude towards the world is based around the frustration of being unable to change what mocks him by being perfect while he sees himself as despicably flawed.  Freud would have a field day with this.The other characters aren't as well-defined, but they're adequate.  Vince Vaughn gives a credible performance, at least.  Jennifer Lopez is, I'm afraid (to quote DigitalBits) a ""blank page.""  She, along with Bruce Willis in ""Unbreakable,"" gave the most hilariously underracted performance in a good movie of 2000.  Her emotional range runs the gamut from ""I'm very concerned about what's going on,"" to ""I'm extra-worried about this,"" with the occasional ""Huh?"" expression plastered on her refined, admittedly beautiful features.  It isn't painful, though; just not up to par with the film.I shouldn't complain too much about her, because this is Tarsem's movie. Unlike other major offerings from former music video directors (such as Dominic Sena's hideous ""Gone in 60 Seconds""), the visual style of the jaw-dropping effects and sets, combined with a score that compliments each new scene almost to perfection gives it a very satisfying feel.  Is it style over substance?  Yes, and that style is absolutely incredible.8 out of 10 for ""The Cell,"" one of 2000's lost treasures.  It's no ""Almost Famous"" or ""American Psycho"" for sure, but it will forever remain a welcome addition to my DVD library.",The Cell
380,barak_pub,definitely worth seeing,8,3 May 2002,"This is an original and intriguing horror movie. It circles around an interesting idea, being able to be in someone else's mind, and develops it well. Lopez quite sucks but overall movie definitely worth seeing. The visuals of the movie is very well done.",The Cell
381,myespion,"Amazing performances, especially by Jake Thomas",9,23 July 2004,"Even though the film is directed towards J-Lo's body, the film will be noted as a terrific thriller. The plot keeps the audience interested while the pace does not skip the details.Vince Vaghun does not overdramatize the most graphic parts of the film and is seen as a hero during the conclusion.The most amazing attribute of the film is Jake Thomas; the boy version of Carl. Thomas doesn't earn any accolades for his performance even though he is the key character to unlock the predicament. He does not phase into this serial killer; he remains as a hurt and innocent child, fearing for his father. The ending is very dramatic and does need to be viewed two times to understand the entire scheme. This film does have a few blunders, but its still a 3 1/2+ star film out of 5. It's much better than what most reviewers gave.",The Cell

383,trigerchic,"Good ideas, somewhat underdeveloped, but visually incredible.",7,17 September 2005,"The Cell is a movie that has really made it's own genre. It has a very unique plot, but the director failed to follow up on it and we are left hanging at the end, with many unanswered questions. However, if you are going into the theater for a good trip and a bit of fun, this may be the movie for you. But be warned. The graphic violence and twisted scenes are not for everybody. Actor Vincent D'Onofrio is excellent, and (unfortunatly) really makes you believe that this could be true. He is very realistic. His seems to be the only character that requires any good acting, and the only one that has any. J.Lo was poorly cast. She does not quite bring the character to life like it could have been. Vince Vaughn did his best in a role that required very little acting at all. All in all, I say D'Onofrio's acting is what made this movie (mostly) work.",The Cell
384,trinka-42782,totally underrated film,10,20 July 2015,"the plot of this movie is, for the most part, just another crime drama about a serial killer. d'nofrio is excellent in submerging himself in his role. Vaughn is also great and should be in more dramatic roles. that being said, the best part of this film is that it is an assault on your senses. visually, it takes you on a journey to some of the places that you would rather not be without a return ticket. it is some of the best imagery ever set to such a disturbing topic, whether it be the transformation of the victims from human to doll to the self image of the killer himself. for those of you who may have a background in behavioral science/psychology such as myself, there are places in the film that you know are very possibly held within the deepest, darkest parts of the human heart and soul. in any case, watch the film for what it is and take a trip into a wonderfully terrifying world that is filled with suspense and mind blowing scenes. btw, lopez isn't too bad in it and I am not really a fan of hers in the first place.",The Cell

Ok so maybe Jennifer Lopez isn't a great actor,neither is Vince Vaughn..but they played their roles quite convicingly and Ms Lopez is a beauty whose presence gives a brilliant stark contrast to the dark images inside a serial killer's mind. ""The Cell"" is one of those movies like ""Se7en"",""Fight Club""and ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"",people are either going to love this movie or hate it with a passion. If you can suspend disbelief and enjoy a movie for what it is..a M-O-V-I-E.then you will like this flick.

The credits were very nice and I loved the composition and from there on we are bombarded with nice (although not that new) visual effects. After the first shock wears out and the viewer begins to think about the plot, it's really nothing special and doesn't really hold up without the effects (which are, at the end of the film, all that I would have wanted to look at).-Reko",The Cell
388,xeslaro,Eye Candy,6,25 August 2000,"I just saw this film today, and I felt compelled to comment on it.  I am sure that a lot of people walked away from The Cell lauding it as an intense thriller.  I, however, am not one of those people.  Having said this, let's get to work.First of all, the pacing is a little slow.  Not slow enough to ruin the picture, but enough so that there were moments when I was aware of the time passing by.  A well paced movie flows from beginning to end, and when it's over you stand up wondering where the two hours went.Secondly, the script leaves a lot to be desired.  The ""thriller"" was rather formulaic in my opinion.  There were no significant plot twists, and I knew exactly how the movie was going to end well before it ended.  Also, the entire set of dream sequences, although impressive, had little to no bearing on the outcome of the story.  Everything that happens as far as cracking the case is concerned occurs in the real world.  For this movie, the sub-plot is far more interesting than the actual plot, which is a big no-no.Perhaps the worst fault in the script is that it is highly implausible. This technology that allows an individual to enter the mind of another is absolutely ludicrous, and I found myself unable to make that leap successfully.Despite these setbacks, the movie does have its good points, the main one being Tarsem Singh.  He took the less-than-extraordinary script to this movie and exploited its strengths to the max, which is a very smart move. The irrelevant dream sequences are absolutely stunning, giving The Cell its well deserved label of ""eye candy.""Also, Singh put his talented cast to good work, allowing them the freedom to add their own unique spin to the characters.  Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn turn in convincing performances, and Vincent D'Onofrio/Jake Thomas play a very disturbing Carl Stargher, even though together they speak about 6 times in the movie.Therefore, on a scale from 1 to 10, this movie falls in the 5-6 range.  If you absolutely must see it, then go see it in a theater, because anything less would be an injustice to the marvelous visual effects being presented. However, don't walk into the theater expecting anything more than impressive eye candy, because you will find yourself sorely disappointed.",The Cell
389,janb-aus-b,Bad Story and extraordinary visuals!,7,9 August 2001,"THE CELL fascinated me at first glance. I was a bit surprised about that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. If it had no story, the film would be better. Bunuels ""Un chien andalou"" comes to my mind- a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is at first a Hollywood-Movie, and only second a piece of art. I'm very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same looks as THE CELL.For film music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely marvelous, but a hard listening experience, because of its very modernistic style.",The Cell

The FBI uses her to get into the minds of a serial killer.  Her task turns from detective work to mothering as she feels sorrow for the serial killer's troubled childhood. There are moments during this film when I wanted to get up and leave because visually I was too overwhelmed.  There were times in the script that seemed unfulfilled.  The acting, too seemed unsatisfying at times.  But nevertheless the quality of the art direction, cinematography, story and terror is truly unique and magical.

I've immensely enjoyed movies like X-Men, Gladiator, Chicken Run, and Perfect Storm.  Then along came The Cell, which ruined what would have otherwise been a respectable summer.  The Cell, in a nutshell: Tacky, over the top, and not in a good way.  Some of the worst performances of the year (Jen Lopez with too much makeup and not enough emotion, Vince Vaughn as a lousy TV cop) coupled with some genuinely cool backdrops and settings.Basically, this movie has been unfairly compared to masterpieces of film like Silence of the Lambs, the Matrix, Fight Club, and 2001.  The visual punch of The Cell doesn't even begin to make up for it's shortcomings- a lousy plot (with a hole so wide that if it hadn't been ignored the movie would be over in half an hour), atrocious dialogue, and all the subtlety of a Marilyn Manson music video.  Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie.  Save the 8 bucks and rent ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Seven"" if you're looking for a quality psychological thriller.",The Cell
395,cricarus,"After a summer of so-so films, ""The Cell"" is a good change",7,21 August 2000,"""The Cell"" is a film that is not for everyone.  It's for people who like to try something different, but like some exotic foods, you have to acquire the taste for it.  This isn't the perfect movie but in a summer of films that continually disappoint (such as the incredibly over-hyped ""X-Men""), ""The Cell"" is a welcome change of pace. Many have cited the plot as being weak.  Granted, the ""on-the-track-of-the-serial-killer-to-save-the-victim"" storyline has been used to ad nauseum.  But it's never been presented visually like this. The direction of the film is marvelous.  Tarsem's direction brings a vivid sense of wonder and imagination to the screen.  One reviewer on this site bemoaned his past as a music video director, but compared to the crop of directors out there creating bland, non-daring films, Tarsem follows in the steps of Fincher in bringing to life bizarre stories in a fascinating and original way. As I mentioned above this film is not for everyone and I can see how one could dislike the film.  New ideas and images in film are met with uncertainty and hostility because they rock the boat (take Stanley Kubrick and reactions to his early works at the time, for example).  ""The Cell"" is a new type of film that one who is curious and marvels at change should see. The story may not rock your world, but the visual originality will.",The Cell

397,davis62,Much too gaudy!,6,27 August 2000,"This movie is far overdone with FX that aren't needed. Hollywood has gone crazy for CGI, using it even when ""normal"" filming techniques would be cheaper and easier. A prime example: Jennifer Lopez ""falls upwards"" out of her cell, and impacts what seems to be water. Why not just put her in a pool, film it and dub? This effect worked great in an Enigma music video. Instead, they hang her on hooks and digitally remove gravity. Overall, this film was bizarre, with some genuinely creepy moments, but the ""in-brain"" sequences relied more on FX than creativity. Silence of the Lambs achieved the same effect much more efficiently.",The Cell

I haven't been moved by imagery so much in a long time, and I saw aspects of video style cinematography in the line of Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Hellraiser, etc., and got a lot of the same feelings I get from a good Boris Vallejo or H.R. Giger painting.  Watch for the horse part.  I won't spoil it, but I am still wondering if they managed to do it all with CGI or with a combination of matte and CGI or something.

The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas.

Money that could have been used to hire an actual writer was wasted upon special effects that were obviously intended to be awesome and mind-blowing but were tired and passe long before they were even a gleam in the director's eye.  It was next to impossible to bond with any of the characters because of the lack of depth and meaningful character interaction.The only thing remarkable about this film is that it takes a potentially interesting, if not new, idea and drags it down to dullness.",The Cell

This world is his and his alone. The cinematography, costume design, and makeup are all brilliant. This is the best looking film since Dark City. Vince Vaugn and Jennifer Lopez are good, but Vincent D'onofrio is excellent.

Vince Vaughn was incredible in this movie, simply because I had never heard of nor seen him before, made watching him even more enjoyable.

Waters & co. are smart enough to know they're not screen actors...anyway), the ludicrous technology (the ""face masks"" are WASH CLOTHS WITH CIRCUIT PATTERNS PRINTED ON THEM) and painful pacing all combine to make this the wost movie ever.Ever.The plot itself, when you remove J-Lo and pretty much everything in the movie, would've been all right.  A psychologist (I think...it's been a while), goes into the mind of her patients, to approach them on their terms, and symbollically work out their problems.  This leads to a lot of pretty but useless scenes, where J-Lo's in a white dress on sand dunes, etc.Which brings up the only good thing about the Cell: it's friggin' gorgeous. The horse vivsection scene alone is great to watch, and it's like a whole movie made out of a Nine Inch Nails video (good thing).It's one of only two movies I ever walked out on (the other being Red Planet.  I think.  Or Mission to Mars.  They both sucked), but the only one I demanded a refund for.What's most sad about this movie, is that it could've been good, but somewhere along the line (*coughJ-Locough*), it fell apart.Don't waste your time, unless you're an art student, looking for ideas. 0/10.

Talk about creepy.  I can't tell you how much I was affected by some of what I saw. The 'Gallery of Dolls' (as I call it)and the scene with the purple cloth were some of my favorites. (SPOILERS OVER) I have to say though, that the main reason I got this film was Vincent D'Onofrio.  He's an amazing actor and even though the movie wasn't the best, his performance certainly was.(CAUTION, *SPOILERS*) In fact, I think that the best scene was the one at the bathtub when Carl talks about his first kill, the baptism thing and his father.  It was a very disturbing scene. I loved the spare gloomy set, the odd intercutting, and above all, Vincent's acting.

Psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) uses an experimental technique to enter the murderer's mind to see if she can learn her location.All of which is a thinly disguised opportunity for scenes, endless and offensive, of young women being murdered and tortured, of gruesome mutilations and so on.  The purpose, I assume, is to illustrate how sick this guy is.

Here we have a movie with some of the most incredible and surreal scenes I've ever seen on film, yet it is marred by a very cliche plot and cheesy sci-fi techy crap that doesn't seem to fit in.Travelling into the mind of a psychotic schitzophrenic sounds like a fabulous idea for a film.  Using this idea one could easily get away with presenting the audience with very abstract visuals.  Indeed there are some absolutely brilliant and shocking scenes in the film with some marvelous and stylish techniques used.  I loved the sudden jerks that the camera makes as well as the metallic sounds crashing now and then to make the killer's mind seem all the more twisted.  I loved the grainy appearance of the surreal sequences as well... and the gore that makes one cringe.However, there could have been MANY more of these scenes in the movie. There weren't enough of them and contrasting these brilliant visuals with the absolutely DULL and and drawn out scenes outside of the killer's mind, made the movie seem like a roller coaster ride between absolute sensory overload and ridiculous schlock.  Jennifer lopez' performance was average if that, and the story was a very predictable one.Also the fusion of a sort of science fiction element to the film made it seem more ridiculous.  The film would have been more unique and scary if the process of entering the mind of the killer would have been more of a spiritual one, rather than involving far fetched and generic looking gadgetry.This movie would have been excellent if it had made no compromises in order to be more accessible to the close minded movie watching public known as ""the shallow choch who loves visuals but doesn't care about plot or acting"".",The Cell

This movie was not worth $7 and I would not be paid any amount to sit through it again.  The only one decent part of it all was the one 3-second scene with Jennifer Lopez' ass.  All of the rest was purely disgusting and I gagged and almost puked 4 or 5 times. I would not recommend this film to anyone.  The only other movie I have hated this bad was Final Destination, but this one is so, soooooo much worse.  I felt guilty for watching it and was purely disgusted by everything in it!  Why this didn't get an NC-17 rating I don't understand.  And for those critics who did like it:  Never, ever, give Kevin Smith any sh%# about the material in his films, because it comes nowhere close to the filth of The Cell.

No surprise whatsoever in the story, everything that has to happen happens, in very slow time (boringly slow). On top of that, hardly any character development. The little there is is a collection of old cliches. What's the point of seeing such a movie? I see none...Interesting visual effects... but not more than a good video clip.

After all, the premise seemed foolproof: Jennifer Lopez and the two talented Vinces (Vaughn and D'Onofrio) starring in a terse psychological thriller set amidst slick, bizarre special effects.  Can't go wrong, I thought.I saw it opening night, and I can say in all sincerity that I never once came close to vomiting.  In fact, I never once came close to even having a clue why this film got all the hype it did.  After we got out of the movie, my friend and I spent the next hour and a half picking it apart, plot hole by inconsistency by ill-advised choice.Basically, it breaks down like this: 2 hours of eye candy does not a good movie make.  Yes, the special effects were beautiful, and yes, they were sufficiently bizarre to garner interesting reactions from my fellow audience members, but when it came down to it, The Cell was just another rehash of the tired old serial-killer genre.  The whole thing started off interesting enough but about halfway through, the movie lost its edge, and I found myself wishing I'd gone to see Spike Lee's new flick instead.  And while I'm on the subject of disappointments, Vince Vaughn, a normally phenomenal actor, seemed to be reading off cue cards the whole time.  Sigh.  So much for the saving grace.",The Cell

This film creates feelings and conflict with computer graphic technology rather than dialogue, and action.  Which is a very difficult task, that has been failed by other films that relay heavily on special effects.  I felt an intensity in many of the scenes that was quite refreshing. The film fell short a bit in the ""real world"" scenes.  I felt distant from the story and rushed.  The conflict Lopez's character felt about entering the mind of the killer seamed forced and the dialogue was week. It was not nearly as entertaining as when she is brought to the throne of the power by the beast of the killer's perversion. The advertizing was acceptable, and saved many of the best scenes for the movie.  It didn't give the plot away.

With commercialism hitting the music industry hard, it was only a matter of time until we could see a great example of it in Hollywood.  The only thing worse than watching people with no talent, but great image, being iconized by media jackals (news as entertainment, MTVedia, bloated recording industry), was watching this movie.Complete fluff from beginning to end.  Lame story, lame (i.e. mindless) visuals (most of you seem to think they were ""stunning, spell-binding, etc."" but they were just colorful and basically unrelated to the movie - Hmmmm, let's put in a chopped up horse part - yes, that would be cool).  Remember, most of the public isn't used to seeing film as art, but film as entertainment.In a society where a person's content no longer matters, but visuals do (clothing, breast implants, lip jobs, hair style, SUV paint-job) it is no surprise to see a movie with such little content, be hailed as it has.

Lets start shooting!""  The story is straightforward enough, but it's like the people who created the film could never quite get the point of it across.  We see some bizzare imagery of the tormented mind of our killer, but that seems to be the entirety of the movie.I had a distinct feeling of eating but not being full after watching this movie.  There were so many more levels that could have been added, but were dropped in favor of gore, or T&A.

Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.

Remember how at the end she went into the simulation but reversed the feed so instead of it putting her in the killer's mind it put the killer inside her mind? The idea, of course, being that in your own mind you have an enormous advantage. You control the ""world"" if you would, you're basically God. But then she totally fails to exploit that. She fights the killer with equal weapons, and doesn't use the terrain to her advantage at all.If it was me in her place the killer would find himself in the middle of a flat plane with his big sword and fetish gear... surrounded by an endless army of superhuman power-armored ninjas toting 20 mm autocannons that he'd have to fight his way through just to get to me. And I'd have turned myself into a 100 foot armored colossus that uses a battleship cannon as a sidearm. As he fought my army I'd be smiting him with thunderbolts and fire from the sky the whole time, and causing the ground to constantly fall away from under his feet, exposing superhot lava from which the zombies of his victims would be constantly trying to grab him and eat his ankles.This is assuming, of course, that I can't just make a cage around him and then arbitrarily raise the world's sea level by ten kilometers or take away the atmosphere and kill him that way.Am I alone in this, or did it occur to other people too?",The Cell

445,philosophous2k,Lacking *more* in style than substance,3,28 April 2006,"I have absolutely no problem with a movie that puts style above substance, but rather than filled with style, I thought the Cell was completely lacking in style. In fact, I thought the movie had more substance than style.In fact, I think Tarsem's biggest flaw is a lack of style. I don't like Tim Burton's style personally, for example, very much either, but Burton is at least very developed stylistically. There's no mistaking a Tim Burton movie: the man has a very unique vision he applies to every one of his films. I don't think Tarsem has that going for him yet, but he's still very early in his career. I also think Tarsem fails to consider the movie as a true, organic whole. He's obviously very visually oriented, but there needs to be more than just visuals even to make the visuals really stand out.I felt there was a very different aesthetic and sense of consistency between, say, the Closer music video and the Cell, though they are often compared. Sure they share similar-looking images at times, but I don't feel there was a very consistent design language that echoed throughout the Cell to really tie the scenes together, and, in terms of atmosphere and accompanying music, I definitely think it's a different aesthetic all together.With a movie like this, I count on the soundtrack equally as much as the visuals to pull the whole thing together, and I felt the Cell was especially lacking in that area. And, before anyone says anything, I can definitely respect all sorts of soundtracks. What I'm looking for is consistency of design - even if I absolutely hate a movie's soundtracks, it's generally easy to tell whether that soundtrack was properly conceived and designed around the visual presentation. Like I said, I don't like Tim Burton's movies for example, but you can tell he has a very pre-conceived notion of the entire thing from costumes to sets to the music. For Tarsem, I believe that he just mixed and matched a bunch of elements which don't go together very well without really considering how they tie together to create a whole.The best thing the movie had going visually was Eiko Ishioka's costume designs, and it's obvious that her designs created Tarsem's favorite images of the movie for which he wisely brought her back in the Fall, but it became too apparent that Tarsem was simply reviving the design style Ishioka had already applied to Bram Stoker's Dracula rather than seeking something unique for the movie (which she could have definitely pulled off), and, unlike Dracula which had that level of consistency tying all the stylistic elements of the movie together (though that movie also not something I particularly cared for, but could respect stylistically), this movie seemed like a jumble of inconsistent, mismatching styles both visually and auditory (I really do think that Tarsem just mixed and match a bunch of conflicting styles without considering how to tie them together).Then again, one could argue that the movie should be that way, as it's supposed to represent someone's stream of consciousness which may not necessarily have anything to tie one thought to the next (especially in the case of a psychotic killer).",The Cell

I didn't really need to see graphic disembowelments, people hanging from rings that pierced their skin, women's dead bodies as sexual objects, and on and on.Which is too bad, because some of the imagery was incredibly beautiful as well.Overall, I give this movie 3 stars because of its slaughterhouse approach to film-making.",The Cell

But it revolves around inept FBI agents, a smart but deranged psychopath and a brilliant yet sexy , single heroine. The film is pretty formulaic to the showdown and rescue. Lopez exuded talent and sex appeal in Selena and Out Of Sight but she pouts her way through this movie. D'onfrio is the saving grace, he seems to be the only one not taking this so serious.  And what is with these seemingly normal individuals who enter the mind of a psycho and come out fine? And did these scientist  have any moral hang-ups about doing this?  How about the parents of Baine adding some conflict by not agreeing to allow the FBI  to occupy the time set aside for their son?

That being said, this is the best movie I've seen this year.  The movie runs away from the typical movie plots.  The FBI agent isn't at odds with the local police department and forced take on the bad guy solo. No, here Vaughn works with the local police perfectly just like they do in real life.  He doesn't bust down the door alone like Jodie Foster, instead he sends in a well armed SWAT team.  It's the little things like this that I enjoy. They also don't play the typical good vs. evil plot where the bad guy is completely one dimensional and inhuman.  Here, D'Onofrio plays a tormented soul who is battling internally with his rage from his excessively abusive childhood.The Cell asks the tough question, can we be compassionate to a killer because he/she was tortured and abused as a child?  Vaughn hints at the idea that he was abused as a child and as a victim you don't have to turn to violence and that it doesn't take away responsibility.Overall we get poignant observations on how we as humans view abuse, pain, death, and compassion and all of this is wrapped up in a tremendously visual experience.  It's the plot of `Silence of the Lambs' with the visuals of `What Dreams May Come' put inside of a Nine Inch Nails video.There's no paltry dialogue or forced love story getting in the way of plot, which is upsetting for typical movie go-ers but, perfect for me.",The Cell

The Cell has a couple of gruesome images (which are only there for shock value), but it never creeps the viewer out the way those two films did.

While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out.  The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not.  Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didn't care what happened to her.  While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example)  Finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky?

Expect Silence of the Lambs in a twisted concept-but just remember the actors who you are dealing with. Anthony Hopkins versus...who?

477,verboten,A comedian is mistaken as a serial killer,8,8 September 2000,"THE CELL * * * *Rated R for violence, sexualityWelcome to HDTV! Yep, fancy videotape was used in making this movie, the remainder shot entirely on 35mm film. It's important because the medium is truly the message and the story here: the high-tech Institute run by detached scientist Henry West (Dylan Baker) employs an unusual and highly derivative treatment room (remember COMA?) that they put empathic child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in to make contact with an autistic child. She's not doing so well and gets fired.An MTV killer, using video and Lakota spiritual practices, is on the loose, gaining momentum and victims by the minute. I guess living in Bakersfield gets boring.The local cops call in the FBI, specifically Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), who is supposed to be the opposite of caring Catherine; he doesn't care if he makes enemies, he knows the killer entraps his young women victims in a bizarre (and I mean weird) human aquarium and kills them over a period of 40 hours. Agent Novak & crew use some unexpected clues to pinpoint their man. The police know their time is limited and twists eyeballs & arms to get Catherine back on her old experimental job at Henry West's High Tech Empathy Transfer Ranch. Only this time Catherine must use the imaginative and controversial neuro-transfer and psychotropic drug system to get some critical details from murderer Carl Stargher's (Vincent D'Onofrio) twisted mind if his latest victim, Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff) is to be saved.We get a mish-mash of visual and thematic shocks and jolts here, spurred on by the entrance into Carl's mind by Catherine: it ranges from Kabuki theater to Fellini-esque phony snowflakes in the hot sun (Namibia, not Colorado) with a host of surprises that will hopefully reveal a clue as to the immediate whereabouts of our latest victim. What we have instead is a prosaic story that relies on that ancient film standby, parallel editing. This old convention using new media is one thing that is drawing such differing critical reactions to this film.One thing about America though, if you can hit the ball, you're in the game. That's what happened to both the director (Tarsem Singh) an East Indian who came from a boarding school in the Himalayas to Harvard to study business (what else?) . It turns out he really does have a knack for finance, since his first commercials won awards that attracted the heavies in the ad industry. The writer is a self-admitted weirdo, Mark Protosevich. It's also his first feature attempt, but it appears both guys ""think visually"" and it shows on the screen. Only in the land of cinema would these fellows pull off such an outrageous stunt, since the film plays much more like a stage version of M BUTTERFLY, but without the interesting character development or story. Instead we get a lavish view of a serial killer's mind: fears of baptism (drowning), sadism at Daddy's heavy hand, and sexuality so repressed that his victims are reduced to a collection of re-animated dolls. The hinge point, and the one redeeming dramatic item, is Catherine's decision to allow Carl to enter her mind, in order to be held, accepted, understood, perceived as human.The ending is questionable. I think it ended well, all things considered, but you'll have to see it yourself to decide. There are a lot of ghastly images of dead, but strangely beautiful, naked young women and I'm not sure if that's what our society really needs more of right now. Of course it's horrifying, but you must ask yourself, is it cool or does it suck? That's pretty much the level of discussion on the movie right now in the chat rooms, but it indicates we may have an innovative newcomer who is not afraid to use startling images to reinvigorate a stale, formulaic industry.

I've read other reviews and heard other opinions from people who have seen this and complained that the film didn't explain itself very well.  It really doesn't but at the same time, that would take up too much time.  Coming from a veteran director of music videos (he directed 'Losing My Religon from REM, and even steals a backdrop from the video for one crucial segment of the film), explanation is not of essence.The film doesn't have a lot of dialogue either and mainly emphasizes on the visual stimulations of the altered world of entering another individual's head.I would definitely recommend this film, although I really can't see too many people enjoying this movie.

493,staceyld,Surprisingly good!,9,7 April 2001,"Surprisingly good!  The promotion didn't do it justice. I would have probably gone to see it in the theater if I had known the plot wasn't the same old psychiatrist/serial killer story.  The effects were great, and Jennifer Lopez's acting wasn't offensive.",The Cell
494,squ1ggle,Dissatisfied,1,18 May 2001,I thought The Cell was a terrible movie. It visually looked good from to time. But the acting was wretched and looked like a vehicle just to expose Jennifer Lopez's body. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It was awful! The makeup was probably the only redeeming factor of this film.,The Cell
495,karjmi62,The idea was great !,4,11 July 2001,"As I said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential. I was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical American mass movie: ""We are in this for the money..."" If only the producers had had more time to actually MAKE the movie. This one was not finished when they let it out...",The Cell
496,yassen222,visual masterpiece,7,30 October 2006,"When I saw the trailer of the film I though,it would be something extravagant.And when I saw the film I though that is an art.The story is usual-a serial killer and a psychologist which is trying to save one of the killer's victims by a new scientific method.But the enormous value of the film is in the scenes when the psychologist and then the cop rove through the sick mind of the killer trying to find answers about the victim who is still alive.Amazing close-ups mixed with beautiful visual effects and compositional decisions.There is a surrealistic harmony in the pictures from the killer's mind.I felt like on the screen there were Salvador Dali'pictures changing one after another.O yeah in this film there is a lot of surrealism and I liked it.Moreover the surrealism is mixed with a story of modern thriller and the replacement of the atmosphere of a thriller and the atmosphere of Dali' picture is also breath-taking.Now there are not so much films with such aesthetic value and that one definitely worths watching.The music is also very impressive.It is oriental and the scene when""Jenny""was talking with the white dog there was music,as a background,which was very similar to the Bulgarian national music.I am a Bulgarian and those rhythm extremely excited me.That film has also very important social idea,about the violence in home and the spoiling of the child's mind.The acting is very successful too.I was surprised to see Jennifer in such role but she is very good.I also think that the film would be even better if there was one actor like Al Pachino,Hopkins or Mell Gibson in the role of the killer for example.As a conclusion-an actual social idea,great visual effects and picturesque outlook,plus horror,drama,triller and sci-fi elements with a lot of surrealism on a background of""beautiful"" music-masterpiece.Congratulations to the director and all the people working on the film.",The Cell
497,hesselm,File under b-movie/gore,2,2 September 2001,"I expected something like se7en, but the lack of suspense is generously compensated by bloody horror gore. Half of the movie is a computer generated non story filled with the sadistic fantasies of the writer/producer. The other half is a boring episode of some FBI series.Lopez has better qualities for another type of b-movie.....The photography was very cool however.",The Cell
498,bcparris-1,So Much Promise. So Little Delivery,3,19 September 2008,The Cell was a brilliant idea that never quite jelled. Visually the film was stunning but the dialog and acting were so flat as to assail my suspension of disbelief. For example when Vince Vaughn's character explains why choose to be an FBI agent it was like the writer said okay I need to tell the audience what his motivation is but I don't feel like going through the effort to make it a logical part of the film. I know I will have him give a monologue on why he is a cop. Well I don't really feel like going to the trouble of making it too original I know I'll just slam a bunch of sappy trite reasons together. This for me was the crux of the problem for the movie. The dialog and plot development just did not live up to what this movie should have been.,The Cell
499,rachelsfg,Best Jenny`s movie ever!!!,10,6 April 2002,"The Cell is the best movie Jenny has ever made!!! It so thrilling... fascinating... besides, it`s got Jenny. The movie catches your attention, you get excited and at the end you just wanna see it again!!! Jenny should act more films like that.",The Cell
500,paraply,Jennifer Lopez best performance.,7,30 December 2003,"I don't normally like movies in this genre, this one was however an exception. The set designs are good and mainly what makes the movie memorable. Also worth mentioning is that Jennifer Lopez (imho) far surpasses herself. In The Cell she is slightly above average. Vincent D'Onofrio is the third thing making this movie worth while. I recommend it.",The Cell
501,Yelsroh_j,The visuals are what makes this movie!,10,25 April 2002,"I saw this movie 5 times in theaters because i just didnt think it would be as stunning on video. I was wrong. The visuals in this movie can be very disturbing for the weak of stomach and of mind. I loved all the dream sequences esp. the ""mechanical dolls"" and the black dog and everyones favorite - the horse! I also enjoyed the footage of the Carls attic and his altered dolls. Also, if you can, try to pay special attention to the soundtrack while watching the movie. I always notice a soundtrack and the first time i saw the opening scene i was amazed and in love with the music!Definetly check this one out if you can handle the disturbing and want a wild visual trip. This is for those of us with a taste for the dark and abstract. Try not to let Lopez scare you away from watching this one - ignore her, watch the movie!",The Cell
502,kacaso,Wow,9,1 September 2002,"The movie is really fantastic. I am amazed at how beautiful it is. I wish it had been longer. The effects were gorgeous, and it was just shot in a really great way. You can't help but be drawn in by it. All I can say it WOW.",The Cell
503,omgitscrazygirl,Vincent D'Onofrio made this movie what it is,8,11 June 2008,"In my opinion Vincent D'Onofrio's performance was one of the greatest aspects of this movie, and without him it really wouldn't have been what it is. Thats not to say that J Lo (an odd but interesting choice) and Vince Vaughn didn't do a good job, not in the least. J Lo's performance was above par and Vince did a very good job considering the role did not suit him too well. But Vincent's performance is what sort of pulled everything together and connected any loose ends that would have otherwise left me squirming in my seat. If you enjoy psychological thrillers such as ""The Bone Collector"" or ""Se7en"" Then consider watching The Cell, you might find that its exactly what your looking for to entertain you.",The Cell
504,asthmaticpunk,It's All In the Pictures,9,5 February 2005,"Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story may be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for it's amazing visual display.",The Cell

I was close to turning off but I was like ""okay now it's getting interesting"" and I couldn't turn away. It was powerful, and almost relatable. I honestly recommend",The Cell
507,rowan-archibald199,One of the best movies ever to watch while tripping balls,9,17 November 2021,"Visually stunning, trippy dream like plot. Watch while high on something on another whole plane. Striking like a French film with out the sub titles and the plot is spot on for a dream.",The Cell
508,agentsarahjane,Meh,7,19 May 2009,"I accidentally started watching this film last night on Starz and really felt obligated to finish it since I noticed that it had Vince Vaughn. ""Okay,"" I thought, ""Here is a film early in his career""- you know like before Jennifer Aniston and the bromances like ""Dodgeball"" and ""The Wedding Crashers."" He seems to be in every movie that has been coming out in the past 5 years.I understand the appeal of Vincent D'onfrio, if you see his work in ""Full Metal Jacket"" ""Men In Black"" and ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" are all I need to show why he has a career. He plays monsters and disturbed people well - gives them a soul rather than making them into frightening behemoths. His reminds you of the dude at the reunion BBQ/pool party who works in the mail room and not the cougar bait neighbor who suns himself by the pool.Jennifer Lopez? I am not so sure either - I can't say she is a terrible actress and I wanted to pin the blame of why this movie could not be awesome but she was adequate - not as good as I think Cate Blanchett would have been.This movie was used as a star vehicle and really should have been acted by more experienced actors- you can see Vaughn trying play the devoted detective and Lopez playing the kind yet seriously devoted child psychologist. Both fall flat because of experience - I don't think that Vaughn knew that he was meant to be a bit crude or the unrefined types. The writers tried to make up for the acting by putting things into the script to explain the story rather than letting the acting and the film explain the story.I could not get into how the invention that got Lopez into the criminal's mind- it almost seemed forced rather than like a graceful way to show us how they will get in. They were almost apologetic for it being science-fiction. Explaining how it got there is not good sci-fi. Saying, ""yeah we got this nifty tool, because this is what we use it for- keep up nerds!"" and instead fumblingly explaining in the dialogue how it works and came to be. Yes, sci-fi lovers care about plot holes- but not about tool props. (Levar Burton wore a gold painted banana clip over his eyes to play Geordi LaForge in Star Trek: The Next Generation. We knew why it was there, but never quite how it worked until later seasons.)If you have ever watched ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" you can see the right way to explain the use of imaginary technology, how it worked and never explained how it came to be unless it was a plot point to make the story arc work.I liked the imagery - D'Onofrio was not wasted in this film and made the script work like the master he was. He couldn't save the film in the same sense that Hopkins couldn't save ""Hannibal"" - they both played their roles well but the hole-y script combined with a weakened female costar made the movie weak.Miss Jenny from the block is not a terrible actress, ""Selena"" is proof of the ability to show a tender side which was what she was meant to show -but she has not been allowed to show her strong side in a more appropriate way - her sharpness has been blunted by the director who is amazing at visuals and stringing together plot with pictures but never quite sure how to get her to show she means business an seems unsure of herself in some ways here. Perhaps this is why Vaughn may have been a wasted resource here too, because if he was more of a bully- in the here he would have balanced the cruel nature of the D'Onofrio character- seeming more cocksure- he would have been great here. Lopez fit into the imagery, especially in the end- a fitting self image especially for Latinas- Scenes shown in this movie could be described as amazing eye candy and I would be remiss to say it helped make the film watchable.",The Cell
509,tua07665,Moments of Beauty,6,18 March 2006,"I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 on sheer aesthetics. I didn't think much of it as a whole but there were parts of the movie so beautiful that i couldn't help but watch it. One scene that sticks out in my mind focuses on a Turtle in a field and then pans out to a road as a car goes by. At least I'm pretty sure thats what happens but whatever the point is that scene sticks out in my mind as being quite pretty. Also scenes in the desert in the beginning and end and the costumes add to this films aesthetic pleasure. I'm not sure what else this director has done, I think an REM video and not much else, but something tells me that he was an art major or something like that, some of the images that beautiful. There are moments of beauty in the cell that are too beautiful for this film. 6/10 and thats generous",The Cell

It's a contrived scenario in which this self-absorbed director can spew forth his twisted visions he should have kept to himself or saved for the canvas.If you claim the visuals are stunning, well then you have an appetite for gruesome, cruel, horrifying images with no grounding in meaning or substance and are simply wading in mindless disturbing and disgusting images for pleasure. And if such things please you, you are disturbed.I can absolutely guarantee you that if you enjoyed this movie, or find it in anyway 'smart' or 'artistic', your IQ is well below mine and you have never produced any work of art yourself that could possibly provide any entertainment or joy to any other sentient being.",The Cell
511,TomThatBomb,Oh dear... J-Lo wasting my time again,3,17 August 2005,"The Cell has such a brilliant concept, (especially since I am very interested in neurology), inside the brain of a serial killer.... where did it all go wrong. Well, first and foremost I will take this opportunity to slate Jenifer Lopez. Maybe I have just seen the wrong J-LO films, maybe I should watch Maid in Manhatten or Giggli..... I THINK NOT! Why on Earth is someone who is famous for being a b*tch and having a nice bum acting in films? This is the first film I have seen her in since Annaconda, both times she has shown her capacity for acting to be about as convincing as a porn star at acting. Other than the ridiculous performance put forward by this stale wench the film had good bits but it should have been much darker than it was. Going through a serial killers mind shouldn't be like walking through an art gallery with pictures of bats, it should be a warped and disturbing place, it just wasn't chaotic enough. ---------------------- Ben Affleck: ""J-Lo you are crap in bed and you can't act""",The Cell
512,szaremba,A roller-coaster ride through the mind using an artistic flair,10,3 August 2016,"Wonderful film. I had to make a review about this to address an argument a lot of people are making: that it lacks substance and it's all about the atmosphere. Words are not the only way in which you can learn about a character. This film is deep. It requires you to sit back and think about it for quite a long time. The answers are there; it was just made by artists who have different methods at storytelling. So yes, it is a visual experience over an oral one. ""The Cell"" seems like a bunch of artists worked together with psychoanalysts. They try to illustrate madness and emotions. What's more, they try to explain the madness. Be prepared for mass symbolism.This is a new favorite film. I gave it 10 points not just for creativity, but also because I knew it must have taken a lot of work to play the mental aspect into the film, as well. Definitely underrated.Similar films? I kept thinking of ""What Dreams May Come"". It also reminded me of the books, ""When Rabbit Howls"" and ""The Yellow Wallpaper.""",The Cell
