0,TheLittleSongbird,"Shouldn't stay in the tomb, shouldn't stay out either",5,28 August 2018,"Really enjoyed the first 'Night at the Museum'. Was less taken with the second, though that was more a mixed feelings sort film rather than a bad one. While not particularly well received, there was interest as to how the third 'Night at the Museum' film would fare and how the trilogy would end. Also the cast are too good to resist. 'Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb' to me didn't turn out to be terrible. Not great, or particularly good, but it is watchable enough and like the second film in being a mixed feelings sort of film. Where does it fare compared to the previous two films? It is for me the weakest of the three and indicative that the series had run its course. It does have enough to warrant a one-time watch, with the special effects and the cast being the best assets.The special effects are all round terrific, elaborate without being overblown and it was clear a lot of effort went into them. The museum setting provides a good atmosphere and all the different historical and such settings and attention to detail are attractive and again a lot of effort went into them. The score is rousing and there are amusing moments as well as thrilling ones.Ben Stiller makes the most out of his material and works hard to make it work. Dan Stevens is a quite exuberant addition as Lancelot, Ricky Gervais is fun and it was interesting seeing Rami Malek and Ben Kingsley together (Malek doesn't quite out-act Kingsley but more than holds his own). Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney (in his final film) make nice small appearances, but other than Stevens the best performance comes from Robin Williams in a performance that's funny and somewhat moving. The monkey is also a scene stealer and just about avoids falling into distaste and the digs and references are quite nice.However, the dialogue tends to be forced and too many of the jokes suffer from fatigue. Larry was written with much more enthusiasm before, he is not particularly interesting here, despite some well-intentioned if cloying father-son development, and he is made to act like too much of an idiot in other places. Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan try too hard and have been much funnier and better used elsewhere, while Rebel Wilson is just irritating. The direction is not as assured.It's the story that comes off worst. It is very tired and predictable, and that is evident in lacklustre pacing and too many been there done that elements, including conflict that is too obvious too early. There is a sense of trying to do too much, hence why things feel muddled, and the characters are too many, some not always relevant. Structurally it feels cobbled together, while the final third is incredibly rushed and over-the-top and culminates in an ending where the sentimentality is too hard to stomach.Concluding, watchable but also rather lacking. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
1,bkoganbing,Teddy and the gang are back,6,17 July 2018,"It will be hard to imagine a fourth Night At The Museum film without Robin Williams playing Teddy Roosevelt so I'm betting this film will end the series with
a trilogy. Still who knows where Ben Stiller will be going next.In this one Stiller learns that the ancient Egyptian tablet that's causing the exhibits to come to life is running out of juice, it needs exposure to the moonlight
every so often for a recharge. The secret is at the British Museum so Stiller and a
select crew from the past two stories accompany him and son Skyler Gisondo.Hero of the first Night At The Museum Rami Malek gets to meet the exhibit of
his father Ben Kingsley the ancient pharoah who created the tablet. Our crew
also has to deal with a rogue Sir Lancelot exhibit who thinks the tablet is the
Holy Grail played by Dan Stevens.The good family entertainment standard is kept up in Secret Of The Tomb. Best scene was Stevens with Stiller and the gang chasing him interrupting a
revival of Camelot on Drury Lane with Hugh Jackman as Arthur as Stevens makes his report to his liege.I kind of hope there's another one, but who could replace Robin Williams?",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
2,SnoopyStyle,Huge Ackman,6,13 June 2015,It's the grand reopening of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History. Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is throwing a party for the glitteraty with all his exhibit friends brought to life by the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. However the Tablet is corroding and the exhibits go wild. Larry discovers that the former security guard Cecil Fredericks was the boy who found the Tablet in Egypt. The magic is disappearing and Larry needs to get Ahkmenrah's father the Pharoah to help but he's in London. Larry and his son Nick travel to the London museum with some of the exhibits and encounter security guard Tilly (Rebel Wilson).The son played by Skyler Gisondo is a bit of a blank. His character is a bad one to begin with and he doesn't help. Rebel Wilson is a great comedic presence and should have had a bigger role. Lancelot is not a particularly great new addition. He's kind of funny but is overshadowed by the bigger stars like Robin Williams. I wish there's a bigger actor for that role like Hugh Jackman. I can only imagine how much funnier it would have been if Rebel had guided the party. There is a father son conflict that tries to give some heart to the movie. It works to some extent but it's not doing anything new. Hugh Jackman (Huge Ackman) is the funniest thing in the movie.,Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
3,nogodnomasters,GOT TO BE REAL,7,23 May 2019,"The museum has been turned into a night time show, one that goes awry. Larry (Ben Stiller) travels with a crate full of characters to the London Museum in order to unravel the secret and restore order. While there we meet Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) and Ben Kingsley, and Rebel Wilson for broader market appeal (i.e. Brits/Aussies buy and see this movie).The film is clearly for kids. The action and drama is low intensity. Larry struggles with his son (Skyler Gisondo) who does not want to attend college.Hugh Jackman manages to play and laugh at himself. There is a speech given by Robin Williams about moving on which was a bit sad. Should be good fun for the kids, although they could have done it without a urinating monkey and BTW Orion doesn't have a bow.Happy Ending",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
4,kosmasp,Going to back to sleep,7,31 May 2015,"It was nice seeing Robin Williams once again on the big screen. Especially because this did outdo the second Night movie. I think it's better written and while it's still a kids movie, it does have adult themes running through it the whole time. Seeing Robin Williams might have been an experience that not everyone will feel the same about, but the movie will entertain you, if you let it.The father and son theme is big here and family in general. Family by blood, but also by other circumstances. The movie has quite a few neat ideas, but also adds new characters to it, that bring the movie to a new level and ""place"" (no pun intended). It should be a good conclusion to the franchise",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
5,jboothmillard,Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,4,23 August 2018,"Obviously with this third film I wanted to complete the trilogy, but it was also significant, being the last movie for both Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams, before their tragic deaths, I assumed it was going to be fairly terrible, but I still watched, directed by Shawn Levy (Big Fat Liar, Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther, Real Steel). Basically a flashback to 1938 in Egypt reveals that the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah was taken by a team of archaeologists in the discovered tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present day New York, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Sacagawea (Mizuo Peck), Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher), Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Octavius (Steve Coogan), Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey (Crystal the Monkey) help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. Larry is also introduced to a new wax Neanderthal named Laaa (Stiller), he resembles Larry and identifies him as his father. Ahkmenrah (Bohemian Rhapsody's Rami Malek) shows Larry that the magical tablet is corroding, it is causing the exhibits to act erratically, this causes mayhem at the reopening of the planetarium. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick (Skyler Gisondo, replacing Jake Cherry) throwing a house party, he is planning on taking a gap year to sort out his life. Larry meets Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), who was part of the Egyptian discovery team, he is now in retirement, he realises the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil says that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre (Sir Ben Kingsley) and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power, but they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) to allow him to ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, and eventually get past suspicious nightguard Tilly (Rebel Wilson). To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter, Rexy and Laaa have come as well, the tablet brings the British Museum exhibits to life. They are joined by a wax Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens), who helps them fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Xiangliu statue and a Triceratops skeleton. Jedediah and Octavius fall through a ventilation shaft and end up in an erupting Pompeii model, but are rescued by Dexter. The group find Ahkmenrah's parents, they learn the tablet empowered through the magic of Khonsu 's power, it can be regenerated by moonlight. But Lancelot mistakes the tablet for the Holy Grail and steals it, leaving to find Camelot, and then Larry and Laa wind up locked in the employee break room by Tilly. They manage to escape, Larry goes after Lancelot, while Laa stays behind to distract Tilly, during which they become attracted to each other. Lancelot interrupts a performance of the stage musical Camelot, mistaking actors Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve for King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but Larry and the others chase him to the theatre roof. The New York exhibits begin to die, Lancelot realises that the quest was about them and gives the tablet back. The moonlight restores the tablet's power, saving the exhibits. It is decided that Ahkmenrah and the tablet should stay in the British Museum, even if it means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends before sunrise. Three years later, Larry took the blame for the planetarium incident, giving McPhee his job back, Larry now works as a teacher. A travelling British Museum exhibit comes to New York, Tilly becomes the new nightguard, and gives McPhee the tablet, showing him its power and the exhibits come to life, Larry watches the party going on from outside. Also starring Mickey Rooney as Gus, Bill Cobbs as Reginald, Rachael Harris as Madeline Phelps, Matt Frewer as Archibald Stanley and Brad Garrett as the voice of the Easter Island Head. The returning cast members are all fine, and newcomers Wilson and Stevens are reasonable, the story is simple enough, but the way it is put together is uneven, the addition of more historical figures may be enjoyable, and the special effects and wonderful views of beloved museums are good, but it is predictable and not as funny as it was previously, a big of a bum note, a disappointing and below average fantasy comedy adventure. Okay!",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
6,BA_Harrison,"R.I.P. Robin Williams, Mickey Rooney, and the Night at the Museum franchise.",5,30 December 2014,"When the tablet of Ahkmenrah begins to lose its magical ability to bring museum exhibits to life, night-watchman Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) takes a trip to the London Museum of Natural History in the hope of finding out how to restore the artefact to full power.The first Night at the Museum movie was a very enjoyable family fantasy that proved entertaining throughout thanks to a highly original concept, the introduction of lots of memorable characters, and loads of great special effects; the second movie was more of the same, but in my opinion made up for any lack of originality by featuring the lovely Amy Adams in very tight trousers. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, the third film in the series, offers absolutely nothing new, delivers precious few genuinely funny moments, and this time around, there are no shots of Ms Adams' delightful derrière to compensate.A monkey peeing on diminutive characters Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and Octavius (Steve Coogan) provides the biggest laugh, which speaks volumes about the film as a whole.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
7,tavm,Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a nice surprise of a conclusion of a series if that's the intention,7,7 January 2015,"Okay, I've previously seen the other two Night at the Museum movies and remember liking both of them somewhat, enough to give both a 6. For some reason, I laughed a little more at this perhaps since I was now familiar with the characters and many of the visual and verbal jokes about them. Oh, and since both Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams died before this was released, I laughed heartily at Rooney's insult at Ben Stiller again, and was chuckling at some of Robin's lines as Theodore Roosevelt but by the time of his last scene, I remember also being quite touched by his last words and facial reactions. So both late players had good final film scenes. I also loved the cameo by an actor known for both playing a superhero and for singing on Broadway. And Ricky Gervais' boss role is way less of a tightwad and does a believable change of attitude when he discovers what he discovers at the end. So on that note, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb seems a nice way to end a series if that's the intention...",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
8,michaelRokeefe,A trip to London to save the magic.,8,8 July 2015,"The NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM franchise continues as night guard Larry(Ben Stiller)has the assignment of managing the museum's new night exhibit. The grand opening presentation goes amok and causes a frightened audience full of dignitaries to run for their lives. Larry finds himself in the worst trouble of his career, but discovers that an ancient tablet in the Egyptian exhibit needs immediate repair and it requires a hurried trip to a museum in London to correct this problem. Larry at this time is also trying to mend a disagreement with his son Nick(Skyler Gisondo).Larry and Nick will make the trip to England with many of the favorite characters of the museum. Teddy Roosevelt(Robin Williams), Attila(Patrick Gallagher), Octavius(Steve Coogan), Dexter the monkey and others will tromp through the museum to locate the Egyptian exhibit to find the secret to repairing the golden Tablet of Ahkmenrah(Rami Malek). Without the tablet, the museum's characters will not be able to come to life at night; losing the magic of the museum.I found this movie more interesting than the previous ""Nights"" in spite of Stiller's lumbering throughout. His scenes trying to understand his son were weak and not genuine. The special effects really made up for the simple story line. William's scenes are bittersweet. The movie does liven up to tunes like ""Calling London"" by The Clash, ""Dancing Queen"" by Abba and ""Shake Your Groove Thing"" by Peaches & Herb.Also in the cast: Ricky Gervais, Mizuo Peck, Owen Wilson, Ben Kingsley, Rebel Wilson and Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot. Also small roles for Dick Van Dyke and the late Mickey Rooney.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
9,studioAT,One last night at the museum,8,22 August 2016,"2nd sequels are hard to get right. Toy Story managed it, Shrek did not. The Night at the Museum series though not only manages to create a third entry that matches the previous two outings, but wraps up the series in good fashion.All the old faces are here, and happily are not underused. There's a good story in place, and the new characters fit in well. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Rebel Wilson, but her energy and humour was good here.It all builds to a suitably big and sentimental finale, but then again the series has form for this. Of course this sadness was greater when you consider that this was Robin Williams' last big movie role.I think everyone concerned should give themselves a pat on the back for creating three old fashioned but timeless family films.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
10,hitchcockthelegend,Night at the Museum: The Closure.,6,27 December 2015,"Part 3 - and expected last instalment - of the poplar NATM series pitches Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) on a mission to save the magic stone that brings his exhibit friends to life. So off he goes to London where new characters and new exhibit creatures join the frothy frolics.In truth it's all very predictable and plays exactly like the money maker it is, but as with the other two films prior to this one, it has bundles of joy for the kiddies, whilst inserting some dark patches and edgy gags for the benefit of the adults. There's fun cameos, one of which is a joyous belter, and all the returning cast members are joined by an ebullient Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot.For a series closer it could have disgraced itself, but with some neat injection of ideas and decent story telling, it winds up as above average. The caveat, though, is that at the same time it convinces that the franchise has very much run its course. 6/10",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
11,Scarecrow-88,Night of the Museum - Secret of the Tomb,6,30 January 2015,"The final film in the Night of the Museum trio of fantasy comedies opens extraordinarily with a search for Egyptian treasures in Cairo where the tablet of magic (that brings to life the exhibits of the Natural History Museum in New York City where Stiller's night watchman works), with its specific hieroglyphics designed to take in the moon light to power it (unbeknownst to all involved). As the tablet corrodes mysteriously, Stiller must find out how to ""cure it"" as the exhibits that come to life once the sun goes down will ""surely perish"" if he doesn't.Honestly, with a plot like this you just have to go with it. The cast of fun faces (Owen Wilson, the late, great Robin Williams (who is so painfully missed), Steve Coogan, and Patrick Gallagher) return, with Ricky Garvais (as Stiller's boss who is unfortunately fired when a night gala presentation for the museum goes awry once the tablet corrodes and the wax figures that are alive go berserk), Dan Stevens (who is an absolute hoot as this dashing Sir Lancelot knight), and Rebel Wilson (as a chatty night watchman at the British Museum) adding humor to the proceedings. Stiller even has a dual part as a Neanderthal that is his likeness (except a bit more muscular and manly)! Anyway, Ben Kingsley and Mizuo Peck are the Egyptian Pharaoh and his Priestess exhibits in the British Museum proud to see their son, Rami Malek, returned to them (Kingsley is the one that knows the secret of the tablet and how to save the exhibits from certain doom if it perishes). The film is loaded with a spectacular cast. Hell, even Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve as themselves show up as King Arthur and Guinevere in a play that Sir Lancelot crashes that nearly steals the film. I have to say that I wanted to see this because it was the final theatrical film of Robin Williams and seeing Stiller say goodbye to him at the end, and in turn us having to as well really brought the tears. Williams, as Teddy Roosevelt (when the tablet corrodes he begins to intimate the former President's famous lines), Wilson as lively Jedediah, the miniature cowboy, Coogan, as miniature Roman Centurion (who services the film as Wilson's most unusual sidekick), Gallagher as the man-of-few-words but loyal-to-the-end Attila the Hun, and Malek's Egyptian prince all join Stiller (along with his adorable pet monkey that my kids absolutely loved) on the journey to the British Museum. The film has skeletal dinosaurs, metal (of various types) animals of all kinds, works of art (when Lancelot and Stiller, and Teddy who also joins in the fray, battle over the tablet within a particularly surreal painting, it gets really crazy!), mounted heads, sculptures, and statues all moving and active so there are plenty of special effects included with the cast to provide entertainment value. The plot doesn't have meat on the bones, and the writing is simple and unobtrusive to what is to be expected: just let the cast do their thing and the resolution leave the audience relatively happy, with wide smiles, and the effects leave an impression when need be. The multiple headed snake sculpture sequence is quite cool. The inclusion of Lancelot is the most pleasant surprise, and Stiller's Neanderthal gets plenty of time on screen to torment the night watchman (their ""sharing time"" where Stiller communicates to the primitive man about his son in the breakroom of the British Museum is a treat) who takes his face within the prehistoric caricature. Rebel Wilson gets her time to run away with her scenes as Stiller allows the actress to shine without getting in the way. Stiller has mastered the ""I'll let you run all over me as I play the straight man to all the shenanigans"" part, as he always gets his chance during the film to earn laughs when he endures embarrassment and difficulties. Stiller proves he can offer entertainments for both families and adults, with the Night at the Museum movies innocuous, harmless family fare you can take your kids to. While none of the actors are a liability, Kingsley is not exactly inspired although his Pharoah's dialogue about the Jews as Stiller uncomfortably shares words that he's not exactly liking what he hears has its amusement. Jackman's standoff with Lancelot after his play is interrupted is a definite highlight.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
12,zardoz-13,Robin Williams' Final Film Performance,8,22 December 2014,"Beyond its worldwide haul of $560 million, the ""Night at the Museum"" movies may not be remembered as the most thought-provoking family-friendly film franchise, but they were neither monotonous nor obnoxious. The final installment ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tablet"" folds up the franchise neatly with fond farewells to both the late Robin Williams and the even later Mickey Rooney, while it doesn't wear out its welcome with maudlin sentimentality. Shawn Levy, who directed both ""Night at the Museum"" (2006), is back at the helm, but scenarists Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon didn't pen this entry. Nevertheless, this featherweight, PG-rated, 97 minute, CGI-laden saga with slapstick galore maintains sufficient momentum. Comparatively, ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" isn't as exciting as ""Night at the Museum."" Ben Stiller is still resourceful as museum security guard Larry Daly. Moreover, Stiller does double duty and also plays a wacky Neanderthal caveman who believes Larry is his pater familias. This constitutes one of several running gags throughout ""Secret of the Tomb."" While they appear briefly at the outset, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs are given far less to do than they did as the kleptomaniacal security guards in the above-average original. In his last film performance, Oscar-winner Robin Williams co-stars again as Rough Riding President Theodore Roosevelt. Enhancing continuity even more, Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan are back respectively as pint-sized cowpoke Jedediah and Roman centurion General Octavius. These two tykes score some of the largest laughs, particularly when they utilize an enormous contraption to post Internet messages. Ricky Gervais returns as persnickety museum director Dr. McPhee; Patrick Gallagher as Attila the Hun; Rami Malek as Ahkmenrah; and Mizuo Peck as Sacajawea. The only change is actor Skyler Gisondo has replaced Jake Cherry as our hero's teenage son Nick; Cherry played Nick in the two earlier epics. Gisondo makes a far less charismatic Nick than Cherry. Further, Larry and Jake's deliberations about the latter's collegiate future could have been left on the cutting room floor. Otherwise, little has changed despite the passage of years. British actress Rebel Wilson, making her debut as Larry's counterpart, a nocturnal British Museum security guard, adds ample spontaneity. ""Downtown Abbey"" star Dan Stevens fleshes out the cast as Sir Lancelot, one of the British Museum exhibits who comes to life, too. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" scribes David Guion & Michael Handelman and Levy freshen up the franchise the third time out with background history surrounding the mysterious Tablet of Akmenrah. Remember, this gilded Egyptian antique is what enabled the inanimate museum exhibits--whether they consisted of wax, bone, or stone--to cavort about after dark as if they possessed life. ""Secret of the Tomb"" unfolds in sun-scorched Egypt back in the year 1938 with an ""Indiana Jones"" prologue. A joint Anglo-American archaeological expedition is searching for a rare artifact, when Chief Archaeologist Robert Fredericks (Brennan Elliott) shoos his meddling son, Cecil (Percy Hynes-White), off the site. Quite by accident, the unsuspecting Cecil stumbles onto the mother lode when the ground collapses under him and he plunges into the pharaoh's burial chamber. Nothing really hair-raising occurs, but this atmospheric incident sets the stage for all subsequent hilarity. Naturally, the locals are more anxious about the tablet's discovery than the myopic archaeologists. Indeed, they warn these outsiders that nothing good can come of this discovery. Eighty years or thereabouts later, the sacred tablet that resembles a colossal keypad displays signs of sea-green corrosion. This oxidization takes a toll on the fixtures so they behave in a menacing manner. During an after-dinner gala fundraiser for museum donors in New York City, pandemonium erupts when the exhibits run rampant and frighten everybody. This debacle deprives Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais of ""Cemetery Junction"") of his job as curator. Young Egyptian King Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek of ""Need for Speed"") suggests Larry (Ben Stiller) fly the afflicted stone tablet back to the British Museum where his astute father, Pharaoh Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley of ""Exodus""), who is one of the exhibits, can clarify what ails the artifact. Of course, the incredulous Dr. McPhee believes none of the claptrap Larry feeds him. Nevertheless, he conspires to help our sincere hero gain access to the facility without arousing suspicion. Evidently, sneaking into a London museum after hours doesn't constitute anything death-defying where British homeland security is concerned. The last thing Larry does before he flies off to handle these hi-jinks is quiz elderly Cecil (Dick Van Dyke of ""Mary Poppins"") about what transpired in Egypt. Eventually, Larry and his eccentric posse, including Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher), Native American princess Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck), Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Octavius (Steve Coogan),Larry's son Nick (Skyler Gisondo), a Neanderthal nitwit named Laa (Ben Stiller), and the adorable capuchin monkey Dexter (Crystal the Monkey) bluff their way past a loquacious security guard, Tilly (Rebel Wilson of ""Fever Pitch""), who has no clue about their intentions. Once they enter the London Museum, our heroes find themselves up to their necks in anarchy orchestrated principally by the conceited, sword-wielding, legendary, Round-Table Knight, Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens), who appropriates the enchanted tablet for himself without realizing the ultimate jeopardy that he threatens one and all into before dawn.The computer-generated shenanigans of the strange London exhibits, a rambunctious triceratops fossil, are every bit as comical and imaginative as the Big Apple exhibits. The highlight of the London mayhem occurs when Larry and Teddy pursue the elusive Lancelot inside an M.C. Escher staircase painting. Predictably, Dexter makes the biggest splash when he gives Jedediah and Octavius a golden shower to save them from the devastation in the Pompeii exhibition. One of the most surprising surprises occurs during Lancelot's interruption of the stage play ""Camelot,"" when he contends with actor Hugh Jackman. As entertaining as the third outing is, ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" surpasses neither ""Night at the Museum"" nor ""Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian.""",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
13,view_and_review,Expect No Surprises,6,20 August 2015,"This movie failed to impress me. Maybe because I was tired after hours of driving or just maybe it was that lackluster. I don't think the movie was bad, just not good.Ben Stiller reprises his role as the night watchman and he did it with the same deadpan style that many of his comedic roles dictate. Stiller as the straight man was never that funny to me. My favorite role of his to this day is Derek Zoolander.The movie is still a good choice for kids. The humor is not too adult and some of the characters can even spark an impromptu history lesson. At the very least I got to see Robin Williams in his final role.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

15,anaconda-40658,Not Much of an Improvement.,3,23 March 2016,"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014): Dir: Shawn Levy / Cast: Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Dan Stevens, Rebel Wilson, Skyler Gisondo: Third and the best of this pathetic trilogy, and that is saying little since this one sucks to. It celebrates life and friendship through its suppose secret in the tomb. It begins in the distant past with the discovery of a tablet that is moved and is eroding so badly that it threatens the existence of the various figures and creatures that come to life after hours. Ben Stiller returns again as the security guard overseeing the museum and befriending the bizarre historical characters. Central plot regards his travels to Britain in order to have the Egyptians that come to life in that museum, examine and fix the tablet. Director Shawn Levy returns again, and the special effects are the big high point. Stiller seems to be reciting this time out as he struggles to maintain order. The sad factor is this being the final on-screen performance by Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt who rides in on his horse. Skyler Gisondo plays Stiller's son who desires to be a disc jockey. Rebel Wilson plays the security guard at the Britain museum. The one shining performance comes from Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot whose best moment arrives when he crashes a play performed by Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve believing him as an imposter and her as his lady love. If only the entire film was this funny. In the end it is a pointless family improvement over the first two films but unfortunately it still belongs in the trash. Perhaps not as far down in the trash as the other two, but in the gutter nonetheless. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
16,FlashCallahan,Huge Ackman?.....,6,13 March 2015,"When the magic of The Tablet of Ahkmenrah begins to die out, endangering the lives of the museum characters, Larry has one day to figure out why and travels to London on a quest to save the magic before it is gone forever.He's also joined by the most famous cast members from the others, and the one from Downtown Abbey, and of course, Sir Ben Kingsley.....I never cared for the first two movies.The first was just one of those high concept movies that looked good on paper, starred man of the moment Stiller, and was released around the holidays to garner multiple big bucks.The second was a cash in, with less charm, and not much else.So its understandable that I had no expectations about this third instalment. Stiller hasn't made a decent film since Dodgeball, and once again, it's released during the holiday, it's all about what to do with the kids on the build up to good old Santa Claus coming down the chimney.And do you know something? This won me over, just.It goes at such a speedy pace, that you can forgive all the plot flaws, yes Stiller wears far too much make up in this, but it's the little things that make the film that little bit more involving than the previous two. The urgency is there a little more, and Dan Stevens is hilarious as Lancelot, one minute the good guy, and then bad, and back and forth and so on.The rest of the cast are back, and despite being given little or nothing to do, they are a welcome return, especially Williams, who gives an ironic, final line in his marvellous career.Stiller though, just seems on autopilot, and Kingsley may have well have just been saying 'cheque please' during every one of his utterances, because he's clearly there just for the money.The final third though, really makes up,for the whole franchise, one moment its hilarious (the Hugh Jackman/Alice Eve cameos are worth the price of admission alone), and then it goes to lump in the throat time.But it has no heirs and graces, the film knows what it is, and if you have children, and endured Levy's career, you'll know what to expect.Not brilliant but far from the disaster you were expecting.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
17,phd_travel,Well done trip over the Atlantic,8,21 January 2015,This is a good 3rd instalment of the series and doesn't disappoint with a trip to London. The Camelot musical tie in with Hugh Jackman is lol funny. Good support from an international cast this time with an unrecognizable Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey as Lancelot and Ben Kingsley as an Egyptian Pharaoh. Rebel Wilson is suitable in her plump security guard role. The British Museum had exteriors and the Great Court portrayed but it would have been nice to see some more familiar objects from the museum featured. The serpent battle was good as was the lions in Trafalgar Square and the little Pompeii. Ben Stiller and his caveman alter ego are good.See it for one of Robin William's last performances. Well done.,Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

19,lasttimeisaw,3 is always a perfect number for a franchise's retirement,4,23 January 2015,"A cinema-going in Shanghai with my cousin, who handpicks this comedy sequel for solace because she has freshly gotten out of a tormenting tug-of-war between her parents and her boyfriend, so I dare not to differ. A five-year gap between the third venture and its predecessor NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN (2009, 5/10) not-so-subtly signifies Twentieth Century Fox's confidence of this money-grubbing family fare is not too strong, or maybe star Ben Stiller's ballooning check is too taxing to meet, anyway, its domestic box-office has been considered a minor misfire ($108 millions income Vs. $127 millions budget after 5 weeks), which may suggest that 3 is always a perfect number for a franchise's retirement.The prologue in Egypt does whip up a bit expectation although the subheading SECRET OF THE TOMB implies that it should not been a surprise at all. With five co-writers billed, the story super-conveniently exploits the origin of the Tablet of Ahkmenrah (not to mention the final solution of its portentous corroding is also super-featherbrained, spoiler alert! we have only one moon, is there any need of globe-trotting?), while not tracing back to the middle east domain, we are forcibly brought to London, and the old same gimmick is put into full- throttle action, e.g. the action piece inside Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher's iconic painting Relativity, the topical gay undertone between Jedediah (Wilson) and Octavius (Coogan), and the scene-stealing stunt by Crystal the Monkey, et al. But the impact is meager, the additions of Rebel Wilson as Tilly, the female equivalent of Larry (Stiller) in the British Museum, is a real hoot, and Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot, guarantees his chivalry stereotype with some insipid friend-or-foe baloney (with a melting nose-job), it is just depressing to find out that Steven chooses this role as his Hollywood stepping-stone and leaves all his DOWNTON ABBEY devotees weeping for his departure, he should fire his agent instantly! Essentially in a more solemn air, one might be emotional to witness two last performances from the late Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney, and delightfully notice that Dick Van Dyke still can boogie in his late-80s. Apart from that, the film is a nondescript throwaway from Hollywood's standard assembly-line, even at its length of 90 minutes, there is inconvenient moment when one can perceivably notice that it has overstayed its welcome, and I'm not just referring to the overlong inter-specific kiss between Larry and the monkey.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
20,KineticSeoul,Whatever...Let's just end this just for the sake of ending it.,4,22 June 2016,"R.I.P. Robin Williams, who was a human being with a amazing heart and brought cheers to peoples. However this just wasn't that good of a send off movie for him and I feel bad for saying that. But this just wasn't a good flick to sit through, it isn't a terrible family film but not something that comes close to standing out. I personally think the second installment is better than this one, at least from what I can remember. The actors seemed to try very hard to act cartoony and comedic for the kid audiences. But I think even kids past the age of 10 would even think some parts came off pretty darn lame. The jokes just came off flat and overdone, like they knew the jokes weren't all that funny. So they try to super exaggerate everything and it goes on and on with it. I am pretty sure most audiences was like ""okay we get the point lets move on already"". It's like Shawn Levy was trying to end it as a trilogy and a cash in. So although he didn't have good enough materials or ideas, he kind of just went with it without much effort. As a matter of fact, most of the actors just didn't seem to care and that includes Hugh Jackman. The whole impression I got from the acting level was just *whatever*. And that practically sums up this movie...Whatever.4.5/10",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
21,Hellmant,The addition of Dan Stevens to the cast was genius!,7,7 January 2015,"'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: SECRET OF THE TOMB': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third, and final, installment in the 'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' film franchise. This one has museum night security guard Larry Daley (once again played by Ben Stiller) trying to keep the magical tablet from corroding and losing it's special powers. He must travel to the British Museum, in order to do this, and save all his exhibit friends. The film was once again directed by Shawn Levy and was written, this time, by David Guion and Michael Handelman (the duo previously wrote the comedy flicks 'THE EX' and 'DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS'). Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais, Rami Malek, Mizuo Peck, Patrick Gallagher and Crystal the Monkey all reprise their roles from the other two films and Dan Stevens, Rebel Wilson, Ben Kingsley and Skyler Gisondo (replacing Jake Cherry from the other movies, as Larry's son) all join the cast. Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs also reprise their roles from the original film (both Rooney and Williams passed away this year, after completing their scenes for this movie). I think it's the best film of the series. The movie begins with a cool 'Indiana Jones' type intro, in 1938 Egypt, where an adventurous archaeologist, and his son, first discover the tablet of Ahkmenrah. Local Egyptian workers warn the archaeologist that if he removes the tablet, ""the end will come"". He of course doesn't listen and, after the story fast forwards to modern day, we learn that they meant 'the end of the tablet's powers would come'. Larry (Stiller) realizes that the tablet is losing it's magical abilities and his friends may go back to being wax exhibits forever. So he travels to the British Museum, in London, in order to talk to Ahkmenrah's father (Kingsley) and prevent this from happening. He joins forces with his exhibit buddies there, who travel by crate, and new museum characters; including a neanderthal that looks just like him (Stiller), another night security guard (Wilson) and Sir Lancelot (Stevens).I was not a big fan of the original 2006 film and I especially didn't care for it's 2009 sequel. I love the cast of the whole franchise but I expected a lot more from the writers of the first two movies (Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, of 'RENO 911!' fame). The jokes felt really forced and extremely dumbed-down (for kids) to me. I haven't lost faith in those two (and still look forward to future movies from them) but I think replacing them, with new writers, helped this third installment greatly. It's more clever, funny and imaginative. I also think the addition of Dan Stevens to the cast was genius. He really made the movie for me and he's had an outstanding year (with this and his star-making turn in 'THE GUEST'). So I went into this movie with pretty low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a satisfying conclusion to a pretty mediocre film series; fans of the franchise should definitely be pleased. I'm still not a fan of Shawn Levy, as a director, but he did an OK job here too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Caps off the series in a respectful and surprisingly resonant way; a fun return to form.,6,5 March 2018,"'Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb (2014)' follows its own established formula almost verbatim, but does cap off the series rather nicely by providing an apt and definitive end in a way which feels respectful and even slightly resonant (though its final dance number does take away from its otherwise surprisingly melancholic mood). The picture is consistently fairly fun and it has few decent laughs along the way. There are also a couple of nice new characters (along with some cool, if strange, cameos) and some noteworthy set-pieces. It's about as good as its immediate predecessor. 6/10",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
23,lesleyharris30,"A Touching Finale to a Great Series of Family Films,",8,25 December 2014,"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a great movie with a well developed plot and a brilliant cast. It was not as great as it could have been, I still think the first one is the best, but it does improve on the second. Thankfully, they got the original characters to play an important role instead of getting a bunch of new characters to take their place, like they did in Battle of the Smithsonian, because although I liked those characters, it's the ones from the first Night at the Museum you want to see. was not very fond of Ben Kingsley's role. I honestly think it was a waste of a good actor, he is not in it for a very long time and does not get to show off any of his acting skills while he is there. It was a poorly written character that easily could have been removed and the plot still would have made perfect sense. The last fifteen minutes are hard to watch, they are certainly the highlight of the whole movie, filled with emotion. I felt sympathy knowing this would be the last time I see these characters, but even more so because it would be the last movie I ever see Robin Williams in, on the big screen. I am happy these got to be his last few minutes of film, because it was a sweet and heartwarming send off that he deserved, and his memory will live on through the many people he made laugh,and sometimes even cry. It is a sweet, simple and fun movie that leans more towards the original in terms of tone, which I feel fans will be pleased with. A fun and entertaining finale, I would recommend Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb to anyone looking for a good family film. Larry and his friends from the museum must head to London to save the power of the tablet before it is gone forever.

26,vincentlynch-moonoi,Enough is enough,6,26 September 2015,"Okay, the ""night In The Museum"" series has been fun. But I think 3 episodes has pretty well covered things. You really only have 2 components here -- special effects and enjoying particular actors. And, there's only so much special effects you can digest until it begins getting old. After all, the plots aren't very deep. In fact, it occurred to me early on that certain elements of the story would have made a very good Indiana Jones story.And so, on to the actors. Ben Stiller is dependable in almost any movie he performs in. Kudos to him for the many hours of enjoyment he has given us! Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt...well, what can I say. A little sad seeing him in one of his very final efforts; I don't really see how the series can continue without him. Owen Wilson...dismissed. Ricky Gervais as the director of the museum...no thanks. Dan Stevens was quite good as Sir Lancelot. I would like to see Rami Malek in other roles; handsome and interesting. Interesting to see Ben Kingsley as a pharaoh. Great to see Dick Van Dyke early on in the film, as well as Mickey Rooney. Cool that Hugh Jackman makes an appearance.The ending -- which by the way was stupid -- seems to be indicating that, indeed, the franchise is over. This one sorta ran out of gas.

27,westsideschl,Cheap,2,16 March 2015,"A really cheaply painted backdrop of pyramids, sky and sand in the opening scene did not instill a lot of confidence in the forthcoming quality. Then a storyline where the boy's weight creates a suddenly appearing hole and entrance to a wealth of artifacts despite the fact that that area was walked and traveled over by countless people and equipment didn't say much for plausibility. Add to that storyline that Westerners decided to immediately loot and steal artifacts shows a poorly written morality. The rest of the movie is best described as unimaginative dialogue such as the warning of a curse ""The end will come."" and the same unimaginative (and cheap to make) retelling typical of most sequels. The movie relies heavily on what is now cheap to make computer graphics. The ending, like the beginning, was a predictable cheap filler of dancing/singing animated museum pieces.

28,Reno-Rangan,"A simple and better than the 2nd movie, But...",5,3 April 2015,"So the final movie in the trilogy. That's what I'm hoping for. Because when the first movie came I thought it was a nice idea and then its sequel was so bad without any further innovative ideas to add up. I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.Ben Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.The rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason. Don't expect high, because it won't serve you.5/10",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

30,filipemanuelneto,The farewell of Robin Williams.,5,23 April 2017,"This is the third and final film of the trilogy ""Night at the Museum"" and takes place mostly in London, at the British Museum. The script consists of a hasty trip to the British capital in order to repair the Egyptian tablet, responsible for animating the figures and statues of the Museum of Natural History, New York. Larry is the right man at the right time, even though his connection to the museum is far more relevant now than a night watchman. The script, however, fails when it tries to create emotive subplots, an error that had already occurred in the previous movie. This time the problem is a no-point family conflict between Larry and his son, who is now a rebellious teenager. This does not interfere with the main plot and ends up being a loose string in the movie, perfectly expendable during the editing stage. More effective in this aim is Laaa's love interest in Tilly, the chubby night guard of the British Museum. Humor and jokes leave a little to be desired, as there is not much new material and old characters have already lost the joke. Its Rebel Wilson, in the role of Tilly, who gets the most memorable jokes along with Dan Stevens, who played Sir Lancelot. Still about the actors, this film retained almost all of the previous cast, notably Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais and Dick Van Dyke, who makes a brief cameo such as Hugh Jackman, in the role of himself. This film, unfortunately, also marks the farewell of Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney, two actors who passed away before the film was released and are honored in the final credits. Thus ends this comic trilogy, with a well closed end that does not allow developments for the future.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
31,leonblackwood,Not that great! 4/10,4,30 May 2015,"Review: I didn't really think that this movie was that great! The jokes weren't that funny and the storyline was a bit silly. Its about a tablet that controls the magic of the museum, which is disintegrating and fading away. Stiller and his trusted museum companions have to take the tablet to a museum in London so they can find out how to stop the tablet from losing its magic. Sir Lancelot confuses the tablet for the Holy Grail and ends up taking it from Stiller and his friends who are fighting to stay alive. The storyline really isn't that great and the movie seemed to go from one unrealistic situation to the next. On the plus side, it does look real and the snake fight was put together well but the patronising humour really didn't work. It seemed more like a final farewell to Robin Williams, who wasn't his usual amusing self and it was one of the last movies starring Mickey Rooney who also sadly pasted away last year. I did like the relationship between Stiller and the little monkey, who shared a touching farewell near the end but there wasn't that many comedic scenes from Stiller. In all, the script really could have done with a rewrite but the CGI is quite impressive. Average!Round-Up: The first movie in this franchise, really worked because it was fresh material and the whole museum coming to life thing was original but they really didn't bring anything new to the table in this project. The director, Shawn Levy, who also made Real Steal, The Watch, The Internship and the awful Pink Panther remake, has directed over 40 movies and TV series but the Night of the Museum franchise has to be his biggest triumph to date. Its a shame that he didn't end the magical museum adventures with a bang! Anyway, Rebel Wilson from Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, put in her usual funny performance alongside Rick Gervais and his dry sense of humour but I did find Stillers son quite annoying. I also liked Sir Lancelot, played by Dan Stevens who starred in the Guest and Stiller played Laaa quite well but the movie seemed more concerned with the CGI than the script.Budget: $127million Worldwide Gross: $360.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their magical/adventure movies about Stiller trying to save the magic in a tablet which brings the museum to life. 4/10",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

Also Rebel Wilson(who plays a funny night guard in London)joins the cast too and former Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens as the hilarious Lancelot who thinks his real and not made out of wax is the films show stealer in my opinion. The humor in this film was great as there was one scene where a monkey urinated on Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan's charcthers.There is no love interest however for Larry this time around and the movie is rather shorter than the first two films. Overall I found this film to be really funny and really entertaining. Although in saying that I did cry my eyes out near the end of the film. If you are a fan of Ben Stiller or the late Robin Williams then check it out. My younger brother was laughing at this when we seen it yesterday with our mom and we all loved.Also keep an eye out (Spoiler Alert) for Xmen and Kate & Leopold star Hugh Jackman who is in the I Camelot play as himself with Alice Eve. Its during the part where Lancelot is finding his love and took the tablet from Larry and mistakes Eve for her and he gets Hugh Jackman's name wrong which was hilarious while Larry says to Jackman ""Hey you have the whole package"".Overall I recommend this film to everyone who loves fantasy and who wants to have a good time at the cinemas.Went to the cinemas: 2/01/20158/10RIP Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney,especially Mr Williams who will be forever missed in our hearts.

For some reason, the tablet is loosing it's power and Ben and Robin have to lead an expedition to England to discover why and how to fix it. That is where they bring in some new characters, including Rebel as the museum security guard of the English museum and Dan as an exhibit there.

Who would've thought that the film would be so successful at the box office to invest in two more sequels? Critics certainly didn't because the film was never warmly received. It was an interesting premise and had a charming cast, but you'd think that the magic had run off by now. I wasn't a fan of the franchise, but I still was entertained by some of the performances and the same can be said about this third film. It has its charming moments, but there are more misses than hits here with the gags. The formula is repeated once again, but one of the positive elements in Night at the Museum is the introduction of Dan Stevens (from The Guest) as Lancelot. He is the funniest character in the film, although he plays sort of the same character as Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story. He thinks he is real and the gags center on that. It is recycled material, but Stevens is funny and makes it work. The other new addition is Rebel Wilson who plays a guard at a British museum, but her character doesn't work. She plays her usual self and the jokes fall flat here. Apart from the lead performance from Ben Stiller and the addition of Lancelot, other positive things about this sequel are the returning characters: Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and Octavius (Steve Coogan) who are perhaps my favorite of the franchise, and the cameos from Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs who return from the first film. Of course the most emotional and engaging scenes are the ones that feature Teddy Roosevelt. It's the opportunity to see Robin Williams in his final feature film. Roosevelt isn't among his best characters, but it was still emotional to see him one last time and get a chance to say good-bye to one of my favorite comedians of all time. The Night of the Museum franchise is family friendly and probably one of the films most families will get together to watch during the Holidays. It is entertaining and kids will enjoy it. There is nothing fresh about this sequel, but I don't think parents will mind. Shawn Levy has made a career of directing these light comedies and his films are mostly average (my favorite of his is Real Steel and that is probably how they got Hugh Jackman to do a cameo for this sequel). There are funny moments, but this isn't one of those comedies that is worth rewatching because the material is recycled. It is fun for a one time watch because of the cast involved, but I don't think audiences will find it funny on a second viewing. There is not much more to add about this film, if you were a fan of the previous two films you will probably end up loving this, but if not it really is more of the same.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

The tablet causes the exhibits there to come alive in the process. (of course) This provides some solid laughs and scenes, and return of familiar characters.

So security guard Larry Daley has to go there and get the tablet fixed before the magic is lost forever.Ben Stiller's character Larry does not get many big comic moments as he mainly gives way to his co-actors to shine. Larry is having issues that his son Nick had unconventional career plans. Stiller does get to do a new role here, that of a new wax model of a Neanderthal man Laa, who was made in Larry's likeness. Unfortunately many of the side-by-side moments between Larry and Laa were hit and miss. Many of these jokes fell flat, with the best parts already shown in the trailer.It was very good to see the old friends we have known and enjoyed in the first two films together again in this concluding episode. These were Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Pharaoh Akhmenrah (Rami Malek), Roman officer Octavius (Steve Coogan), cowboy Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Dexter the capuchin monkey, Attila the Hun, Sacajawea, Rexy the T-Rex skeleton, among others. We also get to see again Dick van Dyke and the late Mickey Rooney who played rival security guards in the first film.When they reach the British Museum, the tablet brings the exhibits there to life. New friends are introduced and more madcap adventures ensue. Aside from the old Pharaoh played by Ben Kingsley, we meet two more important side characters. Rebel Wilson plays female security guard Tilly and she was usually funny. The swashbuckling action of this film was provided by Sir Lancelot, as played by the dashing Dan Stevens. His scene fighting with the Triceratops skeleton was thrillingly choreographed and executed. His scenes with ""King Arthur"" (played by a special uncredited A-list guest star) and those on the rooftop with the melting nose were hilarious.The third act was strangely downbeat for an adventure-comedy film like this. But it has a special sentimental appeal because of the emotional valedictory words delivered by the late beloved actor, Robin Williams. It was not merely Roosevelt saying goodbye to Larry. It felt as if Williams was bidding us (the audience) his farewell. For that special moment alone, this becomes a must-watch for all Robin Williams fans, as this is already his final on screen appearance in a film. 6/10.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
43,ShelbyTMItchell,Final Performances of Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney,8,22 December 2014,"The finale which had been in the planning stages is really one that is bittersweet and the final performances of Robin Williams who will be missed along with Mickey Rooney as both died in the year 2014.Ben Stiller returns as the guard who knows the secrets of the museum coming alive. And how a tablet keeps them that way. But in a black tie affair thing, which went awry due to the fact of the tablet as the animals and people like Teddy Roosevelt that comes to life is about to die down due to the tablet going down.Dick Van Dyke, who in the beginning of the movie, is the boy that originally saw the tablet with his father and other members of a crew. As he is now in the retirement home with Mickey and Bill Cobbs characters. As he helps Ben's character out.In order to solve this and in order to see that the tablet doesn't die down with the museum characters. They must travel the globe, also Ben's son who graduated from HS and is a DJ and taking a year off. Going to London to go to the Museum where they meet security guard, Rebel Wilson again stealing the performances of her co-stars. And Dan Stevens as Lancelot, a funny yet dim-witted soldier that comes to life and will also be linked to the tablet.But still Ben's character also is trying to save not just his job but the museum and Ricky Gervais boss job. Also adds into the plot.Movie is not as good as the original but still, Ben and company pull it off. RIP Robin and Mickey, you both will be missed but forever remembered! :(",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
44,rgkarim,"Diluted Adventure, for Comedic Bluffs, Ending Wraps it up",6,24 December 2014,"Another day, another sequel and this one is unfortunately another kids movie that shouldn't have seen the light of day. I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb. Likes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. Outside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. Now past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. Dislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats which some chose not to. Instead the adventure was put aside for comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson. Sure it happens once or twice I can handle it, but it just kept happening, even at the big, exciting climax, with the lame bad guy. Why can these films not realize the limits of tired jokes? I can't answer it either, but sadly it took away from the movie. Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. Even the normally cute dynamic between father and son was bad, Hollywood choosing to make the son another lame teenager like most movies do. Is it accurate? Probably, but in a movie with magical tablets you would think a little magic could spread to the humans as well. I'm not going to lie, this movie failed me on many levels, and disappointed me for the grand conclusion. Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you wish to pay homage to a few of the stars I wouldn't blame you. My scores for this film are: Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
45,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Looks like back to basics for the finale,6,8 August 2021,"When Night at the Museum (2006) was released it was a box office success and the franchise has proven to be a successful trilogy to boot. Although it's unclear probably to most, how much people really thought it would do well when it first began. It was such a strange idea making a hybrid adventure about something the History Channel would talk about and Pixar's Toy Story (1995). That apparently was enough though to get audiences' attention, not only watch it, but have it financially perform well too. Honestly, it's nothing ground breaking. The whole franchise is more or less a standard kid friendly family adventure franchise. So to say it's below average isn't justified just because not all of the writing is expected to be pure art. Sometimes the most profitable things are of lesser quality. Essentially, that's what the franchise is; escapist entertainment.Of course that doesn't mean its second sequel and finale to the franchise is perfect. It does however round out the stories into a nice little trilogy putting itself back in the same place as the original film. While the film was again directed by Shawn Levy, the writers David Guion and Michael Handelman are brand new to the franchise. They both have one film to their name of which was Dinner for Schmucks (2010). That's not saying a lot but it's something. The story is about again Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) back again at New York's Museum of Natural History heading the evening night show until things go awry when Ahkmenrah's tablet begins losing its energy. Meanwhile Daley is also trying to understand his up and coming son Nick (Skyler Gisondo) with what he plans for his upcoming career.While to storytelling still slips a bit, the writers seemed to have reeled back the cluttering that was in Night at the Museum: Battle for the Smithsonian (2009). Make no mistake there are still some special appearances to be had, but definitely not the same volume as the first sequel. However, these are more like funny cameos as opposed to fully developed roles. What was nice to see was the return of Bill Cobbs, Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke reprising their security guard roles one more time to close the franchise. Despite this, there are still continuity errors riddled between this and the other entries. It seems like no one can tell or knows the full history. And there's also a forced subplot involving another history figure developing a romance with another human, this time a night guard Tilly (Rebel Wilson).Yes, it's for comedic purposes but it makes no logical sense. This also happened in the previous entry, why repeat the same silly plot thread? Unfortunately, comedy in general is still a bit scattershot. Stiller continues to play his character the same way he has for the last two entries which is befuddled and straight faced which only works in certain situations. Other characters like Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) should produce a good number of laughs with what he gets involved in. Then there's also the mediocre humor like a monkey urinating. Oh that's so hilarious, please stop making the audience feel like mindless boneheads. Acting in general though can't be knocked. Everyone performs as to what is called of their character. Everyone from Rami Malek, Ricky Gervais who's looking better in health, Ben Stiller who's not looking as spry as he usually does and lastly Robin Williams in his final on screen performance.The special effects all around still hold up, except for maybe a select few. Considering the budget was less this time than last, it's not bad. Handling the camerawork was Guillermo Navarro, the same director of photography behind Desperado (1995), Spawn (1997) and even Hellboy (2004). While each entry has had a different cinematographer, Navarro helps keep the consistency here too. Lastly the music was once again composed by Alan Silvestri who creates a score to fit this sequel like he did for the last two films. While it's not the most memorable in his works, it does feel like he too put in even more effort since this was the last film in the franchise. It makes all the difference when there's closure to a story and the music is right there helping it along.The final entry in this series still has continuity issues and the comedy is hit and miss. That's not to say it's not worth watching though. The acting is still good, the effects and characters are also more focused. Additionally, the music and camerawork are consistent enough to make this a solid franchise to watch among families.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
46,bobbysing,"A just OK, emotional sequel of the fantasy with some great graphics.",5,5 January 2015,"The third part of fantasy, once again revolving around all familiar characters begins differently from the year 1938 where a few archaeologists are searching for some ancient treasure and they accidentally find it too when a kid falls into a pit. Among the precious finds of that treasure is a magical tablet that later causes all the trouble by making everything alive at night in the museum. And our hero, the night-guard, once again has to set it all right after an unexpected chaos on the night of a big event organized within the museum itself.Written around on a repetitive kind of plot, this time we have more love and emotion in the air along with the usual dinosaurs, Capuchin monkey, Wilson-Coogan's team and all others. Plus Ben Stiller is here in a double role with the hard to recognize one also falling in love with another lonely lady-guard of the British Museum. Supporting the romantic feel Robin Williams also finds a soft corner for Mizuo Peck in this probably final version of the series. And adding to its emotional factor, the film also has a sub-plot devoted to Stiller as a father and his relationship with his young son who wishes to be a DJ.Beginning on an engaging note, the progression loses all its energy in its next hour with various sequences having some historical as well as mythological references too visualized brilliantly like that of a snake demon, exploding volcano and even a tiny Garuda interacting & dancing around in a hilarious manner.In short, the film has its few engaging moments but is not a thoroughly exciting fun ride as one expected it to be. It entertains partially but then makes a soft emotional impact on the viewer towards the end with few moving scenes and the late Robin Williams saying goodbye with a smile. Just a time pass fantasy ride with much less adventure.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
47,quincytheodore,"With some good chuckles and heartwarming scenes, it's an admirable end to the franchise",7,11 January 2015,"After two movies, the assembly of cast grows large and this does bring some pacing issue. It also decides to use old fashioned CG, which honestly isn't crafted very well. Regardless of its campy nature and adventure action gimmick, the movie essentially captures the fun vibe it strives for. The core is performance of the actors who are oddly believable as friends, their farewell fanfare feels sincere and that alone overcomes what flaw it may have.Ben Stiller (Larry) and Robin Williams (Teddy) journey to London for one last adventure. The plot is decent enough ground for the frantic night escapade. A few relationships between the characters are shown, particularly Larry and his sons. This coming of age aspect is unfortunately a bit cliché, although it may be aimed for younger audience who watched the prequels as they grew up. Ben Stiller tries to make the material relatable, but the chemistry just isn't as good as with other actors.Its special effects are also made to cater young audience. While it fits the dreamy theme of the franchise, it's not well polished enough to be memorable nor does it rival fantasy movies in recent years. Many of the creatures seem inorganic and they are there more for obligation than entertainment. Luckily, the script often delivers humorous scenes. Dialogues are witty, more importantly they are delivered by actors who look like they're having a blast.Majority of the humor is done with slapstick. Ben Stiller's cave man clone looks surprisingly decent. However, it still has a couple of persisting problem such as plodding pace at some points, jokes that are made for contemporary audience but don't really pan out. The saving grace of the movie is its cast. Even though the material doesn't have the energy to carry through the movie, the actors perform with guile charm as if this is truly their last reunion. This easily translates to the audience.Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb has its fair share of problems, but it's also a delightful foray and sometimes it's enough for a movie to be enjoyable.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

The pharaoh in NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 3: THE SECRET OF THE TOMB, states that he had 40,000 Jewish pyramid-builders. On the other hand, the pharaoh in EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS, claims that he has 400,000 of Moses' fellow travelers. If my math is correct, these numbers differ by a factor of ten! Had these flicks been made 50 years apart, new research might explain, say, a 50% discrepancy. There's no way to overlook or excuse a 900% difference. This all may be a moot point, in light of THE INTERVIEW's no-religion-mocking-in-the-American-multiplex rule. Tinsel Town could NOT find a theater chain to play a potential NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 4 even IF Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams come back to life. There are far more people in this world who sincerely believe in the classic Gods of Egypt than in THE INTERVIEW's Neo-Korean deity. Obviously, THE INTERVIEW was more or less scrapped and not MUSEUM 3, because Ben Stiller rates higher than Seth Rogen in Hollywood under nepotism rules.

Until recently I've been very down on sequels, it seemed like Hollywood sequels just rode the coattails of the original. I have to say an exception is several of the recent Marvel movies and also this franchise. While this movie is not as creative as the original (sequels never are), they add enough new elements with winning pieces of the old to make a very enjoyable film. Thankfully this time around Gallagher and Peck get the screen time they deserved last time out, and we get to enjoy Williams for the last time, although the original Nick was missed. I daresay Robin wouldn't mind leaving us with his final performance as Roosevelt, a role that was made for him, but we miss him just the same.

54,RforFilm,Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a farewell that pretty much like the previous movies; harmless and family friendly,6,23 December 2014,"Those that have jobs at night can vouch when they claim that the evening takes a different life of it's own. Humans are not meant to live in the late hours, so it's fun to get a different perspective on things. Light shines brighter in the darkness, our senses seem different and even the emotions that run through us feel a bitrebellious. They've made several movies about the night and what we don't know about, including probably the most well known (or at least marketed), Night at the Museum. This family friendly franchise tends to get a mixed reaction; some people love it and some hate it. I actually like the series. Not because of the writing or the performances, but this is just a fantasy that I've had since I was a kid. What child would not think about museums being better then they actually are if the historical figures they came across came to life. The first and second films were big hits for Fox and you would think they would have been quick to get a sequel out, but there was a surprising five year gap. That only sets my expectations a bit more for the third and final movie, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. Museum guard Larry Daley (played by Ben Stiller) has continued to keep his job that allows him to see his historical friends including Theodore Roosevelt (played by Robin Williams), Attila the Hun, Sacagawea, Rexy the T-Rex skeleton and two mini figurines, a cowboy Jedediah (played by Owen Wilson) and a roman Octavius (played by Steve Coogan). The magic that has allowed them to come alive at night comes from a gold tablet that is shown in the beginning of the movie how it was came across. During a museum gala, the exhibits that have come to life to, suddenly act up, causing the party-goers to flee. Larry discovers that the tablets power is running out and needs to figure this out. He's told by the previous night guard Cecil Fredericks (played by Dick Van Dyke) that the museum in London will have the answers. So Larry and some of the exhibits come along to see if they can restore the magic before the corrosion takes hold. On top of it, Larry's son Nicky reveals he wants to take a year off before he goes to college, so he too accompanies his father to save the museum.For those that have seen the previous Night at the Museum's will know the kind of movie their going to get; something that's entertaining, but harmless. So those that did not like the last ones are not going to like this one either. It's the same kind of family friendly humor with maybe one or two adult jokes. In fact, much of the familiar characters are doing the same thing. Theodore is spewing motivational speeches, Jedediah and Octavius are the comic relief and Larry Daley is the straight man to play off everyone. Not that nay of this is bad, but it can get repetitive.The biggest difference here is that while the second movie was filled with celebrity cameos and tried to go bigger, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a smaller, more blunt story that knows that it's last ride needed to be simple. As far as it was, I enjoyed it. Without giving anything away, the movie actually closes on a note where it makes it clear that there are not going to be anymore of these movies. I was surprised by how touching it all was without going too far with the goodbyes.I'll give this six T-Rex skeletons out of ten. While I had fun watching this history lesson, I say that it's time to close the museum for renovations!",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

After an incident occurs at the museum where the exhibits behave very strangely, Larry & Ahkmenrah realize that the magic of Ahkmenrah's tablet is slowly getting exhausted. Now, it is up to Larry to take the tablet to the London museum & find out its secrets before the magic is lost forever & the exhibits don't come to life anymore. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a fun-filled movie. It is on par with the previous two movies of the franchise. I loved the new characters in this movie, especially, Sir Lancelot(Dan Stevens), Tilly(Rebel Wilson) & Laaa(Ben Stiller). The new exhibits at the London museum are innovative & beautiful. The special effects are enchanting. The jokes are mostly for kids but, adults will enjoy this movie as well. Ben Stiller is outstanding as Larry Daley/Laaa. The Neanderthal Laaa is especially hilarious & is one of the highlights of the film. Robin Williams is great as Teddy Roosevelt/Garuda. Owen Wilson is brilliant as Jedediah. Steve Coogan is spectacular as Octavius. Ricky Gervais is impressive as Dr. McPhee. Dan Stevens is awesome as Sir Lancelot. Rebel Wilson is hilarious as Tilly. Skyler Gisondo is impressive as Nick Daley. Rami Malek is good as Ahkmenrah. Patrick Gallagher & Mizuo Peck are effective as Attila the Hun & Sacajawea respectively. Ben Kingsley's talent is somewhat wasted in his small role as Merenkahre. Crystal the Monkey is adorable as Dexter. If I had to pick one flaw in the movie, it's that I miss the character of Amelia Earhart(Amy Adams) from Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian(2009).

57,Danusha_Goska,Enjoyable Enough; Not Great,5,21 December 2014,"You don't go into ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" expecting great art. You expect a few laughs and some moments of wonder as you witness museum displays magically come to life. The first ""Night at the Museum"" disappointed me. The second, ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" surprised me with how much better it was than the first. Amy Adams was wonderful as Amelia Earhart in that film. This new, third installment, ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" was only okay, but it wasn't horrible, either. I really, really wish it had been a bit better. It's one of Robin Williams' and Mickey Rooney's last movies. Both died this year. Robin Williams does look visibly tired and sad. One of my favorite stars makes an unbilled cameo appearance, but it is more awkward than special. Dick Van Dyke, who is a national treasure, is in the film, but only for a few minutes, and he isn't given much to do. Ditto Ben Kingsley as a pharaoh. If I were a director, I'd want to milk Sir Ben Kingsley as a pharaoh for all it was worth. Not here. Dan Stevens, formerly of Downton Abbey, is charismatic and impressive as Sir Lancelot, but his character is demoted from good guy to bad guy, and his face is disfigured, in a way that feels envious. It's as if the movie is punishing him for being a tall, gorgeous, heroic white male. Museum night guard Ben Stiller's relationship with his now teenage son is emphasized, and it doesn't feel real at all.My two favorite scenes involved Luke Wilson as a miniature cowboy and Steve Coogan as a miniature Roman soldier. In one scene these tiny people try to comment on a youtube cat video. In another scene they are saved at the last minute from an exploding volcano. In terms of plot or special effects magic, ""Secret of the Tomb"" doesn't offer anything that you can't get from the two previous films. There are no moments where you say, ""Wow, I am really glad that they made this movie, so that we could see *this.*"" Even so, I mildly enjoyed the movie. If you are looking for a mindless, family-friendly good time, ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" may serve your needs.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
58,bellino-angelo2014,A perfect conclusion for a great trilogy,9,25 January 2019,"I really really loved the first NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, it was funny, enjoyable, full of great CGI, and with great performances by all the actors. The first of the two sequels, BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN, even though not liked by many, it was just as enjoyable, and I liked it very much. This, the concluding chapter of the series, is also very enjoyable.In SECRET OF THE TOMB Larry Daley and his friends (and also his son) have to go to the British Museum for re-charging the tablet because it became green after years and all the exhibits behave very strange. In London Larry and the gang meet Sir Lancelot, a Tryceratops skeleton, a huge 7-headed snake, a Garuda and Akmenrah's parents. And it all ends well, with, after some years, all the exhibits from the British Museum in the New York museum.Even though a bit weak when compared to the first two, this chapter is still good. There is as usually in the series great CGI and special effects. The cast is as always full of famous faces: in small cameos Dick van Dyke, Bill Cobbs and Mickey Rooney (in his final movie), Hugh Jackman as himself, Robin Williams (in his final live action performance) and Ben Kingsley as Akmenrah's dad. But I have to agree with some other reviewers including TheLittleSongbird that Rebel Wilson is very annoying at times.However, while not perfect like his two predecessors, it's still very worth watching also for Robin Williams' final bow.

This is a film you take kids to, nothing very educational or interesting, a little bit funny and that is it. Not really a film for the adults.

It's a sure-shot elevation from its disappointing predecessor even if it doesn't reach the charming heights of the first installment. In this one, Larry (Stiller) spans the globe, uniting favorite and new characters, while embarking on an epic quest to save the magic of the tablet before it is gone forever.Ben Stiller is a hoot especially as his other character, Neanderthal Laa; Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, and Rebel Wilson all pitch in hilarious supporting acts; and new addition to the series, Dan Stevens, completely steals the show as Lancelot - here's an actor and future star - who can seamlessly essay any bloody role scripted for him.However, there are quite a few moments, where the fun and charm seem forced in order to appease the kiddies and family audience, which makes this a scrambled slapstick and bittersweet farewell for Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney. Still, ""Secret of the Tomb"" is a fun enough trilogy finale for every family or fan that has followed the series.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
62,RevRonster,Not my favorite but still fun...,8,1 March 2015,"I loved the first one, I loved the second one and, despite some drawbacks, I love this, too.Sure, the story doesn't develop the backstory of the fact that Cecil (Dick Van Dyke) was there when the Tablet of Ahkmenrah was discovered (since it was pretty interesting, it would have been nice to see a little more development from it) but, what is delivered, serves just fine. Sure, I wasn't the biggest fan of Rebel Wilson's character but she has some amusing moments. And sure, I felt the film didn't have a very strong or central antagonist like they had in the previous films but, for what its worth, what we got was fine.My complaints are minor and didn't really hurt the film for me because it was filled with fun characters, has a lot of great tender moments, great special effects, amazing acting, and it's very funny. Overall, a decent close-out to the franchise that wraps up things nicely and didn't fail to deliver an entertaining family-friendly comedy that I had a lot of fun watching.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

It is entertaining and have good performances, but the spark of genius, spontaneity and fun is slowly wearing of.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
64,MattBrady099,"Good for kids, not for me",5,1 January 2015,"For the final night, the final movie and the film ended...so so.The story is about Museum guard Larry Daley played by Ben Stiller, heads from New York City to London in order to save the magic that brings the displays to life, as the tablet is losing its power.A quick recap of the other two Museums films and then I will talk about the third one: The first Night at the Museum film I thought was pretty good and solid family film. It's harmless and very creative of what the creators can do with the famous figures of are history. But the second movie I thought was a big mess. I remembered not laughing that much while watching the film, and is it just me or the movie was like it was pleading for me to laugh at it but I was left in silence for the all film. So yeah I didn't like the second movie but I liked the first and with the third one I can say.... It's better than the second movie, I can say that at least, but I'm going to be honest here, this isn't a good movie, it isn't bad, it's just not that good.Ben Stiller once again returns to his character ""Larry Daley"" and this time his character isn't the same character where he will wave his finger out at people and say ""Don't do that I'm telling you"", or ""Hey get away from from that"", yeah that kind of character, but in this he changed a little well since this is the last film and probably the writers of the film thought to themselves ""Yeah he needs to stop being a boss pot and lighten up a little"", and I respect that and Ben Stiller did do good in this. All the other cast members all do good even Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke had a scene in this and it was pretty good scene. The movie looks really good has well like the all movie has that Christmas with that light blue color to it.Now let's talk about the ending to this movie and this isn't a big spoiler because you know this is the last movie and all the character's have to say their goodbye's and the scene with Robin Williams and Ben Stiller wrap up moment almost had me in tears. It was like Robin Williams himself was saying goodbye not just to Ben Stiller but to us, yes you the people. I know this isn't fully his last movie because there's another movie that his in called Absolutely Anything and that comes on this year where he plays a talking dog and Simon Pegg is in it as well, so that's really his last role, but the goodbye scene in this was pretty sad and Robin did really good in this movie, like he always do. Now for the things that didn't really work in my eyes like: The cave man in the movie that's suppose to be the comic relief got on my nervous and if you just take him out of the film the all movie wouldn't feel like it's missing something. The writing in this isn't all that great, yeah it's a kids and family film so yeah I can see why they have to dumb it down, but come on the one liners in this fell so flat to me.Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is not a bad film, it's not flawless and the movie isn't trying to be. If somebody ever said to me would I recommend this film to family and kids and I will say yes go a head they would enjoy it... I hope, but it's not for me.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
65,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Sweet and sentimental adventure film, good in its own way",7,5 March 2015,"Night at the Museum was an original, hilarious, fantastical smash hit - but can Secret of the Tomb compensate for Battle of the Smithsonian's misstep? Night at the Museum can be everything an audience wants from a family film for the whole brood. Secret of the Tomb delivers adequately in the way a third film should, with heart, care and laughter.Larry the night guard is still living the dream caring for the exhibits, and familiar characters, that come alive at night at the Museum of Natural History, thanks to the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. But magic is a fickle thing, and the Tablet is deteriorating, causing mayhem, havoc and danger to his pals at the museum. Motivated to save his friends, he ventures on a quest to discover more about the Tablet which brings him to the Museum of London as a last ditch effort to restore the Tablet and preserve his waxy, plastic and ancient companions.With its third and final installment, director Shawn Levy returns to the magic that existed in the original Night at the Museum which ultimately captivated film-goers. As with many sequels, the third installment stays true to the premise of its predecessors and only slightly freshens up the premise with a couple of new characters and a swift change of location. Screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman smartly bring back beloved characters from the first film and don't muddy up the premise or story too much with over-complications.Fans of the franchise will be pleasantly surprised by the heartfelt and sentimental Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. The thoughtfulness and homages to ancient history are present and the jokes have a wide enough range to make any age giggle. Rebel Wilson might be the one drawback for some viewers, as her distinctly loud character is weird and obnoxious and detracts from the sweet film.Film watchers be warned, you might shed many tears by the end of this film, as this film critic did. The poignancy and relevancy of the film's final scenes are nearly too much as this film touches your soul and makes you nostalgic for the wonder that is Robin Williams.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
66,estreet-eva,Increasing self-awareness makes up for a creative sputtering,6,6 April 2015,"Pressing a given comedic premise - in this case that all of the museum pieces come alive at night - into service for a third cinematic treatment will challenge any set of writers and clearly this installment sputters creatively. However, the movie realizes this and fills some of the gaps with what seems like on-set banter including dead-pan Ben Stiller's ""can't we all just get along"" compromising and political correctness. Stiller -as the center of the film - holds the expected wild improvisations of Robin Williams final on-screen effort and Rebel Wilson's latest outing. Kudos to Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan who co-star as tiny diorama figurines and thus don't get to interact with the remainder of the cast for the most part. Jeers to some bottom-of-the-barrel monkey ""comedy"" largely made up of a Capuchin relieving himself. At this point, even eight year old boys have grown bored of that trope. Beyond that if you've seen the first two you've seen this one. In short, much like ""Parental Guidance"", come for the improv and banter rather than the well-trodden story and bring the kids.""",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
67,TaylorYee94,"Goodbye, Larry",7,22 October 2021,"Nice way to wrap up the series: both keeping the original charms & narratives and parting away properly.

69,James_De_Bello,4.5/10,4,31 January 2015,"I hardly define myself as a fan of the Night of the Museum Series, but what I will say is that I saw the second one and had a good time even though I totally forgot it and I have seen the first one a couple of times and find it pretty entertaining even if nothing remarkable. So what I was expecting was to have some cheap laughs, a couple of good ones and have a some 90 minutes of fun without expecting anything special. Unfortunately I came out disappointed.There really isn't any grade that describes this movie better than a 4. There is no reason to give it a lower one, because the movie has nothing to get angry about, nothing that was abnormally weak, but at the same time the movie did nothing more than a couple of ""ha""s. Yet the reason it gets half a grade more for me is the cameo inserted into the fourth act. I don't want to spoil it, but up to that point I was mostly bored and man when that kicked in I laughed out loud for five minutes straight, because not only it is a good handled cameo, it also goes on for some time and spawns genuine good comedy.There isn't really much to go in depth about, was I bored out of my mind and so angry I wanted to leave? No, but at the same time I was bored for many moments. This movie is so mediocre and unremarkable it really isn't in anyway interesting to go into any details. Good moments. Bad Moments. Lots of in the middle. Just one great.Is it fine for a family to go and watch at the theater? Sure. Is it anything a film fan would think of for more than twenty seconds? No.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
70,scottshak_111,A fine farewell to Milan Trenc's tale,6,4 January 2015,"Shawn Levy brings, yet again, another part to the franchise that has so far been successful in raking him decent moolahs. So this one right here is just another endeavour to innovate and elongate the already great Milan Trenc book that should have stopped right at the first part. Nevertheless the movie is a happy hoot and as long as it brings smile to our faces, nobody's complaining.Night at the museum: Secret of the Tomb is just another flick that promises a little bit adventure with a little humour. It does venture into wee bit drama, as its predecessors have, with some side story focusing occasionally at the father and son tension. However, everything still ends up forgettable and dispensable.The best thing about the movie is Rebel Wilson. She tickles your guts with her cool humour. To see Robin Williams come alive once again was actually nice. There were some new introductions and pleasant additions to the story besides the old gang, which I believe might carry forward unless Shawn starts minding the money.Can watch. In fact, perfect for kids. :) And definitely if you want that, once and for all, closure.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
71,shawneofthedead,"Hardly groundbreaking, but a charming and, at times, bittersweet final chapter for the franchise.",6,23 December 2014,"No one would blame you for expecting the worst from Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb. The first film was fun but hardly groundbreaking, and the second a rather forgettable retread. This final entry in the franchise could simply be cashing in before it cashes out: raking in some money at the box office from a holiday season crowd desperate for family-friendly, feel-good fare. What's so unexpected is that there's actually a zany spark of life to Secret Of The Tomb, one which makes the film a joy to watch - even if its plot is decidedly undercooked.Larry (Ben Stiller), the night watchman at one of New York's finest museums, has been privy to its biggest secret for years. Every night, the enchanted Egyptian tablet of Akhmenrah (Rami Malek) glows and all the museum exhibits - from President Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) through to pint-sized cowboy Jed (Owen Wilson) and Roman gladiator Octavius (Steve Coogan) - come to life. But disaster strikes when the tablet begins to rust and the magic starts to fail. Desperate to keep his friends alive, Larry travels with a motley crew to London, hoping that Akhmenrah's parents - currently on exhibit in the British Museum - can help make things right again.Anyone watching Secret Of The Tomb for its plot (um, why?!) will be disappointed. The story is predictable and rather silly, draped as it is around a big, mysterious and ultimately anti-climactic family secret regarding the magical tablet. There's a clumsy attempt to shoehorn some emotional growth and depth into Larry's relationship with Nicky (Skyler Gisondo), his now college-age son who's keen to take a year off to be a DJ in Ibiza. It's hard to shake the feeling, too, that the script was cobbled together to give everyone in its hefty ensemble cast something to do - Jed and Octavius' misadventures in the British Museum, in particular, are fitfully amusing but largely inconsequential.And yet, there's such a lot of joy and heart to the proceedings that it's easy to give into the film's blithely silly moments - of which there are, thankfully, many. Chief among its delights is the addition of Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey fame, showing off a surprisingly keen sense of comic timing) to the mix: the pompous, seriously pretty knight struts through the film with an outsized sense of purpose, and provides most of its belly laughs. We even get a wonderfully-imagined chase sequence set in the loopy twists and turns of an Escher painting, a biblical reference better than most of Exodus: Gods And Kings, and a star cameo so funny that it's easily worth the price of admission.The cast isn't really called upon to do their best work, but they give it their all anyway. Stiller's trademark brand of deadpan haplessness continues to amuse, as he literally pulls double-duty in playing both Larry and Laaa, his new Neanderthal doppelganger. Dick Van Dyke makes a brief but very welcome return to the franchise, as do Bill Cobbs and the late Mickey Rooney (in his last screen appearance).But the emotional heft of the film is really provided by Williams, who plays Teddy with such charm and warmth that you might find yourself tearing up at the most unexpected moments in the film. Each time Larry is forced to confront the possibility that his buddy Teddy might be frozen in wax forever, so too will the audience be reminded that they must savour the talent and energy of one of Hollywood's finest comedians in one of his final movie roles. Franchises like Night At The Museum are simply not intended to set the cinematic world alight with their brilliance and intelligence. But it's nice to see that, at the end of this particular franchise's run, its creators still harbour quite a bit of love for the oddball characters who - quite literally - come to life on screen. Indeed, the resolutely family-friendly Secret Of The Tomb is at its best when Larry fights to save this surrogate family he's found with a little bit of luck and magic.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

Now it's not often that a sequel surpasses the original but in this case I think we have a winner. This latest offering is another rather wonderful example of what the imagination is capable of. We all remember that as kids we wanted our toys to come alive, and like the other two this continues the theme of the museum exhibits assuming life and taking on the personalities of who they represent. This third instalment brings Larry Daly, his son and our museum favourites to England on a mission to repair the golden tablet which is starting to deteriorate. We also learn the history of the tablet, how and why it was created. The usual battles against improbable foes and a race against time ensue and there are laughs along the way. Very poignant moments as we are watching the greats that are Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams, indeed the film remembers them in the credits.

Surprisingly, it didn't feel like a re-hash and was actually funny. It's one of the funniest films this year. Everyone does such a great job. It's a bittersweet end to both the Night at the Museum films and Robin Williams' films. This is a fun movie and its so clever. Hopefully there will be a box set of all three films released so I can watch them back-to-back. I cried because the end is so bittersweet. It's a terrific send-off to the late, great Robin Williams.

In this installment, the tablet that keeps the exhibits alive at night is starting to lose its power and the only way to prevent the magic from disappearing is going to the British museum which would be able to restore the power of the tablet back to its glory, I will say while in some ways it closes one chapter being Larry daily but leaves the story to continue with another.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

77,abouhelier-r,Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,8,8 February 2015,"Larry spans the globe, uniting favourite and new characters while embarking on an epic quest to save the magic before it is gone forever. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is the third Night at the Museum movie which gives us a third adventure. This film was definitely more entertaining than I thought it would be. At this point a third movie is just going to pay checks and have a bunch of CGI dinosaurs running around with historical figures. Don't get me wrong, it is a lot like that but it's pretty good. I may (I know I am) be still a big kid at heart but when I see Lancelot fighting a triceratops: I'm happy. There are some obvious parts in the movie where they could have find some other twists and turns rather than going for the obvious. Keeping in mind that the movie is aiming children nonetheless. The comedy however is historically speaking very smart; beside this cave man thing which is just dumb comedy and is bringing the movie down. If he wasn't in the movie it would have been a pretty solid comedy movie for kids AND adult. Then adult based references start kicking, some surprised cameo as well and that I don't think a child could get them. Moments like that impressed me. Moreover, it engaged children because the magic that brings everyone alive at night is going away but what engage adult is the reliability of human characters, the heart brings us into a kid movie. At the beginning the movie was kind of lacking in this aspect until it excelled which is almost not deliberately done. It's not a spoiler but you know at the end of the film they're all saying goodbye and it's Robin Williams last film... He's saying his goodbye and it is really really deeply sad. It's even hard to watch. OK. I cried. Robin Williams is saying goodbye to us. It made me glad I watched the movie, that was a scene worth seeing for sure. This ending eclipse the rest of the movie and take to a whole new direction. Overall this film has some good jokes, some others fall flat. It's a fun adventure for kids and surprisingly for adult as well. If you are yourself a big kid and a fan of robin Williams I highly recommend it!

The first ""Night at the museum"" was way much better than the sequel. The reason for a grown up to watch it, is Robin Williams because... magic always can happen. The special effect are good enough to keep the interest of children alive, but not the new characters. Beside all the above, a trip to London is always a nice thing to do (even if you don't actually living it), you will enjoy some of the cameo like Hugh Jackman's, and Ben Stiller is again the right person in the right position. If you want definitely to watch this movie, watch it with your kids.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
79,stephendaxter,An emotional and slightly funny conclusion to the trilogy,7,25 February 2015,"This is a movie franchise that i have had mixed feelings about, i really enjoyed the first Night at the Museum but the second film i felt was very messy and i didn't enjoy it anywhere near as much as the first. So going into this third film that i didn't even expect them to do, i had very low expectations. Although this film wasn't quite as good as the first installment, i felt that it did perform above my expectations and was better than the second one (the one i'd rather forget). This film had a very similar plot to that of the first film that seemed to work so well and change it up slightly so that it actually felt like a fresh adventure. Despite being a new adventure it did at times feel a little predictable, mainly because by now we know what to expect from these films in terms of any surprise twists. And the main twist in this was not very surprising, just knowing that it was going to happen made the lead up to this twist at the twist itself not very interesting. So the beginning and end of the film were pretty entertaining, the beginning had more of the jokes you expect from this film and the end ditched the jokes for a more emotional and uplifting tone. Whereas the middle just kind of acted as a lot of filler with not too many effective jokes. There is a really cool celebrity cameo about 3/4 of the way through that completely stole the film for me, it was the most random thing and happened to be the funniest bit of the movie. I wont spoil it but when you see it you will know what i am talking about. Who also stood out in the film was Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot who i have really liked in his previous few roles and i can tell that he has a range of talents after this performance. In the end, this film was a third installment to a franchise that didn't fall completely flat but could have used more consistency by making the middle of the film a little more enjoyable. There are also a few teary moments involving Robin Williams and his character that really make for some emotional scenes. Was good to see him acting in a film one last time. - 6.6",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

And that's what really matters in this, because it's for families, not Oscars.-The story is rushed and doesn't make much sense or hold much weight in the film honestly.-The pace is not bad. It doesn't waste time, but it does drag once or twice.-The acting is meh. I feel like Ben Stiller didn't try that hard, along with some of the supporting cast. A few others however, Robin Williams and Lancelot, are great! -The characters are cheesy, but they are not meant to be super deep, serious people. It's a fun film guys.-The effects range from questionable-to-good, but not Oscar worthy.-The music is good, but really a repeat of the first film.-I will say what makes it good and fun is that it feels more like the first film! It is adventurous and sometimes tearjerking, but still fun throughout.-It is rated PG, so yeah.-So although it has some major cheese and doesn't let up on a pointless story, Night At The Museum 3 is still fun and surprisingly heartwarming.

82,hypestyle,Inoffensive but Light Family Comedy,6,18 April 2015,"""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" is the third installment in the NATM movie series starring Ben Stiller as Larry, the harried night watchman at the New York Museum of Natural History that has to play caretaker to a gaggle of museum exhibits that magically come to life every night.This time around, the plot concerns the magical Egyptian artifact that allows the exhibits to come alive. For obtusely-described reasons, the magic tablet is losing its potency. Several of Larry's museum pals are now acting erratically (or rather, more erratically than what's been par for the course so far in the series). Apparently, the only way to find out exactly what's going on is for Larry and the gang to go to a British museum where an Egyptian Pharaoh and wife are embedded, to hopefully get some answers. (The overseas transport of several human-sized museum statues is treated with matter-of-fact aplomb; one of many such curiosities in the film that are best just accepted.) Along the way, the ragtag group (including stand-ins for Sacajawea and Genghis Khan) encounter a replica Sir Lancelot, who becomes a new companion on their quest. Among the exhibits returning for this affair are Owen Wilson as a miniature cowboy and the late Robin Williams as President Theodore Roosevelt.A father - son bonding subplot is a little lukewarm: Larry's son Nicky (Skylar Gisondo) is presumed to have a strained relationship with his divorced father but the portrayal doesn't seem to revolve around much besides low-key arguments about future plans, in between ducking Triceratops skeletons and snake statues.Also helping add to the fun in the film are cameos from an assortment of known Hollywood personalities. Recent ""It Girl"" Rebel Wilson (""Pitch Perfect"") has an amusing turn as a guard at the British Museum - and it is vaguely hinted that the torch-- or rather, flashlight-- will be passed along to her for any possible future installments.There is not much objectionable here, with the exception of a monkey relieving himself not once, but twice.

It turned out they took us to the cinema. It was one of those surprises that you can't believe was real. We saw the first Night at the Museum. I remember liking the concept very much. I have always found museums fascinating, especially the ones of Natural history. So, the film always appealed to me. I saw it twice. Then in May 2009 a sequel comes out. I remember having a fun time. When I left the cinema I was thinking: ""What will happen in part 3?"". Well, 5 years go by. And, a third film is ready to hit cinemas. I had to wait until February to see it though. I finally got around to doing so today. It was kind of an empty cinema. Kind of a different feeling compared to how packed it was last week when I saw American Sniper. Anyway. I enjoyed the film. It was a good idea to make story about what would happen if the magic ran out. At the end though I felt really sentimental and a bit sad. The credits came up and everyone rushed out. I wondered if the kids today would feel the way I felt watching it. I remembered all the fun times I've had with my friends at school. It was really nice seeing all the character again in their full glory. The last film that made me feel this way was The World's End. But, this one left me thinking more. I had completed a journey. It started out with all my friends and school in the cinema together. And, it ended with me alone. The movie at it's core was about moving on and saying goodbye to the past.

86,Brevin_Campbell,Toy Story 3 and Robin tooo,8,27 December 2014,"Does anyone remember Toy Story 3? Do you remember how emotional we all got when we saw the finale of that film. Well get ready cause Night at the Museum does the exact same thing except we get even more emotional as we say goodbye to the late and great Robin Williams as well in the film. The film had some great beats as the characters rushed to save themselves from dying by fixing the tablet under the moonlight, and bringing them all back to life. While I wasn't super impressed by this movie I did in the end still enjoy it for what it was, and earns two thumbs up from me, because it was in fact a very emotional roller coaster ride that I did in fact highly enjoy. So if you miss Robin Williams, and liked Toy Story 3 then you will enjoy Secret of the Tomb as well",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
87,Elivx,Least favorite of the bunch.,5,4 January 2021,"Unfortunately, the trilogy has now officially died. Both 1st and 2nd films were both successful at the box office with positive reviews from critics and fans. The third part proved also successful at the box office, but not as successful as the previous ones. Night at the Museum movies have now gone from funny and magical films of adventures to tired and boring films of stupidity, In terms of plot and characters, so what went wrong?:1. The plot itself is the biggest reason to the film being bad. The plot is too simple and lot of it rehashed from Part 1. It's basically Part 1 all over again.2. The characters we KNEW in love in the previous films have now gone into a boring and completely muted idiots. It feels like even the actors don't want to be in this film.3. Forgettable new characters. Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) acts as a very annoying idiot just to be with the main ones, then Turns into a villain for no reason, then turns into friendly in the end of the film. Next, we have Tilly (Rebel Wilson), a complete jerk and mess-of-a-girl I've ever seen. She's so annoying that I even skip the parts she's in. Every scenes she's in aren't great. She's also the only character from any of these films supposed to be a jerk.4. Wasted cameos & recasting. For example, the villains from the first film make cameos in this film, (also played with the same actors) and get only like 5 minutes of screentime?!!! Jake Cherry, who played Nicky has been recast with Skylar Gisondo. The problem was that the duo was born on the SAME YEAR. What's the point of recasting someone with someone else, who has born on the same year as him?5. Disrespectful ending. The film ends with Larry Daley quitting his job as a night guard to go work as a historian teacher, because the tablet, which had to be left alone with Ahkmenrah and his parents to London, then turning all the wax figures of New York to wax forever. However, the film cuts to 3 years later with the annoying girl, Tilly now working as the new night guard in the New York museum. A party is currently held in there and the wax figures have came to life due to Ahkmenrah having time in there with them. Outside, Larry Dayle is seen looking at the party while smiling. It feels very disrespectful towards him for not even being invited to the party or just going inside to party.The only good things about this film:1. The battle in the Relativity painting: There's a scene where Larry and Teddy are fighting for the tablet from Lancelot. They accidentally get into one of M.C. Escher's paintings, ""Relativity"" where the laws of gravity do not apply, causing them constantly fail to catch the tablet. The visual effects and CGI- effects are VERY SUPREME in this scene, It's very satisfying to watch.2. Robin Williams' character, Theodore Roosevelt might be the only good character in this film. He still does everything very well and acts very well like in the previous films.3. Mediocre humor.Overall, those 3 good things aren't enough to save this film, which was just a sad possible ending to the series, aswell as a bad last movie to Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney, who both sadly passed away in 2014.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
88,moviescoundrel,"Not So Historical, But a Good, Funny Wrap-Up",7,2 January 2015,"The third film in this series proves to be almost in line with the first as far as originality or creativity, at least better than the second. Not all of the characters are present here, only some can travel to England, among them, the most welcome, the Caveman ""La"" (Stiller) who is a caveman who was molded after Larry's (Stiller) likeness. The exchanges between Jerry and La and pretty much most of the scenes with La are hilarious. There is of course some cheese present and things that happen that feel forced and the humor is sucked right out of them. There are also some original ideas that occur with Larry, Lancelot, and FDR in a painting and a cool idea with Pompeii. That's it for originality, and that is when the film is at its best. I do wish Levy and the writers would have fine-tuned the screen play and come up with more fresh ideas and characters like this as it makes the movie good, and a bit more time in the oven, it could have been great. While not an amazing film, it is better than the second, and worth checking out if you are a fan of the ""Museum"" movies.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
89,AmyJenson1995,Great way to finish a great trilogy,9,24 February 2015,"I just watched this movie at the theater 2 days ago and again I had a wonderful time watching again Ben Stiller, Robin Williams in his final movie (sniff sniff) and their waxy strip revelers mates. This time the movie sends us to the beautiful city of London and the British Museum which will experience what New York Museum of Natural History does every night. That's too bad though that we can't enjoy a wider tour of the City but it's fine. There are great moments in this movie too most notably thanks to the British counterpart of Ben Stiller. She actually steals the show each time she appears. Ben Stiller is equal to himself and plays two characters: Larry and his Neanderthal copycat which copies each of his movement but using the wrong tools which causes a lot of accidents. But I can't talk about this movie without talking about Robin Williams, who died tragically a few months ago saddening the entire world. He takes for the last time the role of Teddy Roosevelt, the 24th US President and we can actually see how a great actor he was. Each of the scenes he appears touched me because I'm a huge fan of his work and this movie is actually a wonderful tribute to his legacy, already filled with great memories. We will miss him for sure. It's simple acting but always spot on. You don't need anything else. It's sober but it gives its effect.

92,OlieRendch,"Don't lie to yourself, you want a Capuchin monkey too.",8,23 December 2014,"You know, Night at the Museum is one of those films where it's not a huge movie, it's not a blockbuster, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just generally not talked about in the film fan world as I've seen it. It is however regarded as a nice family film to sit down and enjoy, so was the second instalment, and this one isn't any different.We all know the premise; a special Egyptian tablet makes it possible for all the exhibits in the museum to come to life at night. What I'm glad about is that this third film is not a rehash of the previous two; it's predecessors had a similar theme of a main villain wanting the table,t which were different enough to enjoy but Secret of the Tomb does something completely different with it's plot and execution which is an awesome change I enjoyed a lot. Of course another thing we enjoy with these movies is the actual museum coming to life and they do some really cool stuff with that idea and it's awesome to see these historical figures interact with statues and even paintings!They brought us some new characters too which included Lancelot who steals so many scenes and has some great lines, I love that character; also we get Ben Kingsley as King Merenkahre who surprisingly didn't actually have much screen time for a big-name actor. Rebel Wilson as a British security guard didn't quite grab me as the other characters did, she was the comedic relief in what was already a comedy so her presence wasn't really needed and could come off as annoying. In the end Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb was a fun ride just like the first two, it has some awesome surprises I wasn't expecting and all round a good family film.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
93,russellingreviews,The end of the magic,5,21 December 2014,"The magic is running out on the tablet of Ahkmenrah, but has the magic run out on Larry and his friends from Night at the Museum? Walking into the cinema... The first film was a magical and a surprisingly endearing experience. Night at the Museum presented a fresh concept that worked within this ensemble of characters. In the second outing to Washington DC, the magic diminished, but can they recapture the magic in this London adventure? Overall rating: 2.5 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Family value: 3 stars The success of the Museum of Natural History in New York and this film series has come to rely on the magic that comes about every night. During a special fundraising event, things go terribly wrong and the much beloved characters of the museum turn on Larry Daly (Ben Stiller) and the event's audience. After all of the years of coming to life in the museum, the magic tablet has begun to corrode and the magical effects are beginning to fade. The urgency of fixing the problem escalates as the museum characters continue to turn back into their wax-like state. The historical solution takes Larry and company across the Atlantic to London. In the original expedition that brought Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) to New York, his parent's sarcophaguses were sent to London. Through a series of events, Larry and crew are sent to London to find the solution to the tablet's problem. Pharaoh Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) holds the answers to the fate of the tablet and the museums. Larry has to work through the London museum and the reaction of the artifacts and displays as they come to life for the first time in England. Through this international adventure, Larry has to come to terms with the eventual changes and conclusion to the the magic of the the tablet, this chapter of his life and the series. The Night at the Museum series has presented another successful run for the director of the Pink Panther and Cheaper by the Dozen series, Shawn Levy. The original Night at the Museum story was rich with fresh ideas and humorous situations, but as the magic fades from the tablet so does the fresh ideas for this series. Even with new characters and the international setting of this film the gags have become predictable and stale. Ben Stiller has made a career out of his dead pan comedic style, but during this instalment he comes off bored with the role. The new setting has the potential to present new twists to the sleepy tale, but in the end leaves a 'been there, done that' feeling to the film. Dan Stevens' (Downton Abby) turn as Sir Lancelot was initially energetic and fun, but eventually lost its lustre as the story continued. Unfortunately, Levy turns to the boorish and tiresome Rebel Wilson (Pitch Perfect), as Tilly the London night guard, to try to infuse new life into the film, but her style has also become predictable and boring. Sadly, when the best twist of the film are the inclusion of key cameos, you know that the series has run its course. Inevitably over the nine years of this film series the human characters have matured and their life situations have changed. The appeal of this film to the younger audience was the relationship between Larry and his son, Nick. The underlying issues of a father trying to connect with his young son, humanised the story's situations and connected people with the characters. In this version of the story, Nick (Skyler Gisondo) has grown up and is becoming an adult. The circumstances around Larry and Nick's relationship have changed over the years. This dynamic causes a disconnect with the younger audience members. Which leaves the direction missing it's target audience and lacking the relational magic of the first film. The film will appeal to the fans of the series, but like the story line, it shows that all things must come to an end. During post-production of this film, Shawn Levy could not have predicted the tragic death of Robin Williams. Unlike the situation with Heath Ledger and The Dark Knight, Williams' performance was bittersweet to experience. Knowing that he was suffering through the beginning of Parkinson's disease and depression made many of the scenes uncomfortable. Also the farewell scenes were haunting and turned this endearing tale into a tragic reality. The story line and the situations outside of the the production caused an introspective experience that probably were not the intent of the film, but could lead to discussions about death, world religions and God. This light-hearted story was dampened by the tragedies that surround the situations off the screen. The film should have finished with an endearing conclusion, but the film leaves you with the hope that the producers will see that the Night at the Museum storyline has run its course and it is time to let it go. Leaving the cinema... In a season of remakes and sequels, Night in the Museum: Secret of the Tomb was benign and harmless. They were looking to restore the magic to the tablet throughout the film, but the magic has gone out of this series. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film 1. Is there life after death? (John 11:25, 1 Corinthians 15:51-57) 2.What value is there to a good relationship between fathers and sons? (Psalms 127:1-5, John 5:19) 3.

94,captainmike-michael,Museum Has Loses All the Magics,4,28 December 2014,"The last night at the museum has its own moments just like the previous two installments, the Egyptian theme and the tomb at the very beginning of the film might bring audiences the feeling of getting back to the first two Mummy films, but soon after that, everything ruins thanks to the easy, lazy story line without a proper exploration on each characters development and to build a logic connection and memory among themselves. It intends to be ridiculous, joyful and hilarious, especially the monkey character, Dexter which impresses the most are all the main factors that the film is suitable for family goers on Christmas. The film would be a complete disaster without Ben Stiller to lead, but this does not save the film to look dull, not so funny with lame jokes, weak scores and to look inert. Overall, it is a disappointment as this family franchise film lacks of inspiring message, burns off the original film's energy and ideas, and ends losing all the magics abruptly.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

It was good fun. Exactly what you've come to expect from the first two movies, this one has extended the basic premise by moving the whole shebang to a different museum, with some new and different characters. Negatives: our whole family finds Rebel Wilson an extremely annoying actress, who can only play one character in every movie she's in, so I really hope the producers don't try to go back to the well for NATM4 starring Rebel Wilson next time. Having the Ben Stiller Neanderthal character was mildly amusing, but the director flogged the joke way longer than sustainable. Also the scene in the theatre - with two actors playing themselves - was also flogged for way too long. Pluses: bringing the three old nightwatchmen back for a short scene was great, lots of star-spotting cameos, all the threads were tied up, the magic of the tablet explained and the movie had a couple of nice messages. But it was very sad watching Robin Williams' final performance. RIP Captain my Captain.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

97,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb Review,7,19 December 2014,"My Thoughts:I have always enjoyed the Night at the Museum series. I was a volunteer at the Air and Space Museum shortly after the movie was released, so it was fun interacting with the visitors that came in and asked about all the things they saw in the movie. Yes, they are not completely accurate, but they are still fun to watch.This time, there is something wrong with the tablet that brings the exhibits to life and the only one that can help them out is Ankmenrah's father, Merenkahre, played by acting great Ben Kingsley. The problem? Merenkahre is in the British Museum.We get to see what it is like for the exhibits when they are brought to life for the first time and how confusing and disconcerting it can be for them trying to figure out what is going on. We get to see this most prominently from Sir Lancelot's (Dan Stevens's) point of view as he helps out the New York visitors get through the museum.Now, for all intents and purposes, this is the last Night at the Museum movie (at least, it seems that way for Ben Stiller). However, they did kind of set it up for Rebel Wilson who plays Tilly, a security guard at the British Museum. I will probably get flack for this, but I hope this isn't so. I am not a big Rebel Wilson fan. I think she is good as a secondary actress, but I don't think she can really hold her own in the primary role. She, like Melissa McCarthy, are one-trick ponies; they do the same shtick over and over again and never seem to bring anything new to the table.This movie is not an all-time great movie, but it is a cute, funny movie that will take your mind of the real world for 90 mins. So, this holiday season, if you are looking for something funny to watch, you can't go wrong with choosing a movie such as this. My Recommendation:Fans of the series will enjoy this latest installment in the franchise. Others, if you haven't seen the first two, you should and then watch this one.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

99,k844140,A good ending,7,9 August 2021,"The third Night at the Museum of course has its problems, but generally it's a good film and a decent ending to the story.Speaking of flaws, there are some of course. For instance, they returned the jokes about monkey's urinating, which wasn't really necessary. And I still don't understand how this tablet works. It brings to life lion statues on London streets while Loncelot passes by, but it never turned the statue before New-York museum to life. Another thing is that in the first film the old guys switched it off by turning the central part, but in this movie everyone turns these plates as they want and nothing happens. Also it looks strange that exhibits can travel on a long distance away from the tablet and still remain animate. Another flaw is some visual effects' performance. While some of them look pretty good, others like the monkey tricks which the real one couldn't perform - they look bad and obvious. New Neanderthal doesn't look funny almost in every scene too. But all this doen't spoil the film too much.Speaking of good parts, they really made me enjoy the movie. Actors look quite fine. Octavius, Jedidiah and Dexter are funny as always. Robin Williams made a great job, and it's sad it is his last movie. The ending with leaving the tablet in Britain doesn't look perfect, but it still makes the farewell to the New-York exhibits really emotional and sad. Also we finally have an explanation of what this tablet really is and how it got in the museum. Loncelot is good as a stereotypical knight and provides us with a bit of a satire. And this cameo of Hugh Jackman was a great surprise. Changing the museum to the British one was a good choice and provided us a few interesting scenes and made the film differ from the two previous ones.All in all, despite all the flaws, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is an enjoyable movie for the ones who like the first two pictures.

This movie's plot is focused that tablet. The movie starts in 1938, as with discovery of the tablet by a young boy. Flash ahead to present date - the tablet which is Gold in color, is now turning Green, and the exhibits start to display strange behavior for them. The first movie completely took place in New York, the 2nd took us to the ""Smithsonian"" in Washington D.C., and the plot drives this final entry to London, to the ""British Museum"". I found the first 2/3rds of the movie mostly ho hum. The final 3rd had some good laughs, including a very funny sequence where a couple of celebrities playing themselves make a surprise cameo, and there are touching moments as all comes to a conclusion. There are couple of scenes where Robin Williams's has lines that are poignant, and sadly appropriate, in what turned out to be his final live action role. It's as if he was bidding us all a sweet farewell. Kids and the Kid in all us should like the movie just fine. The adult part of me – the last 3rd is worth it. 2 ½ out of 4 Stars.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

He brings his final lines over on screen so beautiful, so with emotion that it hits you right in the heart.Number 3 is a good goodbye to an amazing and very successful Film Franchise. And a very good last film of Robin Williams. There is emotion in this film but also many laughs and that balance makes this film great. If you liked the first movie and maybe the second than you certainly love this one. There is a great acting performance of the Casting , except Rebel Wilson really didn't like her. The final story is wonderful. This film is really for all ages. In my opinion they could have given Laaa less playtime. He was really annoying and not funny at all.

105,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,"Third Night at the Museum: Less fantastical, more heart",7,28 December 2014,"You expect a Night at the Museum and you get more than that! There are less fantastical situations and craziness, but more heart in this third installment of the series. Nonetheless, this movie delivers what it promises and more – there's comedy, adventure, fantasy, and even bits of drama—all of these well blended with family audiences in mind. Nothing too weird or too scary. It is definitely entertaining, funny and touching. Will you laugh? Yes, there are plenty of funny moments for both children and adults. My 10 year old daughter laughed and cheered--she was thrilled. Any memorable characters? Absolutely! My favorite character was Sir Lancelot and his quest. So charismatic and dazzling! He adds freshness and plenty of plot twists and surprising scenes. His character has dimension. I also liked the Ben Stiller caveman--he is naive, appealing and charming in a rugged sort of way. In this third movie, the Ben Stiller's Larry character, our hero, has a more mature and calm disposition. Larry's adventure has two layers of story –the deeper human connection and the tablet quest to save his exhibit-friends. This is not a shallow movie. I was surprised to see the several subplots: the friendships, the father and son dynamic, Lancelot's mini-quest, and a hint of a funny-mismatched romance. It's satisfying to see how some of the characters change and grow.Are the special effects any good? They are great! As always, seeing museum exhibits come to life is a delight.Any negatives? There were some things at first that felt sort of random or disconnected, but as the movie progresses, it all comes together well. Now, about Robin Williams' performance... it has a veil of melancholy and sadness. He did not have the happy energy from the first two movies. Ricky Gervais too was a bit less energetic, I would've liked to see more of his typical obnoxious self. Bonus - you get a partial tour of the spectacular British Museum. Overall this is an entertaining and funny movie. Please watch it and enjoy! Cheers.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

Multiple times while I was in the theatre, everybody just broke out in intense laughter.We see the return of Ben Stiller as Larry Daily for one final Night. Sadly, the trilogy doesn't end in the National History Museum, but in the British Museum. But unlike last time, a good chunk of the good characters (Teddy, Sacagawea, Octavius and Jeb, Attila, Dexter, Daily's son Nick, and some random caveman who thinks Ben Stiller is his dad), most of whom were absent from two, are actually in the film. With tons of fun, it's definitely worth one watch. But the ending leaves you with no desire to watch it again, it's that bad.All in all, it's a good comedy, but it's a bit too short and has a terrible ending that almost ruins the film. This film scores a 7/10. Without the terrible ending, it's an 8/10. It's a good film, just they ended it terribly.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
107,Sahl_95,Good Fun,8,21 December 2014,"In the third instalment of the Night at the Museum movies, the tablet that brings the museum exhibits to life is losing it's power and to fix it, Ben Stiller and the gang have to go visit the only person who knows how to fix it, at the London's British Museum.This movie was definitely more entertaining than I thought it would be. Most of the jokes did entertain me despite at times being obvious, although a few do fall flat. However, I did not enjoy the comedy involving caveman Ben Stiller (thankfully, there wasn't much of it). I think the movie would have been better without that character. The story is straightforward as expected, but still good enough to not be boring. The returning cast do a good job. Newcomer Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot was my favourite character and was great fun to watch. There were also some great cameos which I did not expect and won't spoil and was awesome.There are some cool scenes in this movie that really pleased my inner kid, mainly when Sir Lancelot is fighting a triceratops and a scene involving a M.C. Esher painting along with a couple of others. I did also like the ending. It was a bit sad when it came to their goodbyes, especially when it came to Robin Williams'. Overall, it is a solid movie for kids and adults should have an alright time.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
108,mr-abarton,Absolutely Hilarious,8,25 December 2014,"The movie opens in 1938 Egypt during an archaeological dig that's searching for a Tomb, that's believed to contain an all powerful ancient Egyptian tablet. Suddenly a young boy disappears through the sand and finds himself in an ancient tomb. His father and the rest of the party climb down to help him and discover that he's inadvertently led them to their prize.......the tablet of Ahkmenrah. However, as they prepare to remove the tablet, four locals tell them not to as 'the end will come'. The movie then moves to the present and finds Larry (Ben Stiller) in charge at a huge, high profile event, being held at the Museum of Natural History. Larry's gathered all the main exhibits together, Rexy, Attila the Hun, Sacagawea, Dexter and Theodore Roosevelt who are going to put on a show, with the guests, which include the museum's Director, Dr McPhee (Ricky Gervais), believing that they're seeing advanced Animatronics. The event starts well enough with everything going swimmingly......that is until the exhibits start to behave strangely. Larry's informed that the tablet, now housed at the Museum, is turning green and he has no doubt that the strange behaviour is linked to the tablet. After researching the tablet, he discovers that his first port of call, would have to be to see one time Museum security guard Cecil Fredericks (Dick Van Dyke). After telling Cecil what's happened, Cecil tells Larry to seek the help of two important Museum exhibits..... Ahkmenrah's parents. In this hilarious sequel to Night at the Museum and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. All the the cast are on top form, with the humour, one-liners and slapstick, hardly giving you enough time to catch your breath. I think Laa, a new Neanderthal that's been modelled on Larry is hilarious. Seeing the late Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt, one last time made me realise how funny he was and how much he'll be missed. The movie is filled with the usual amazing special effects and takes you far and wide in a fast paced race against time time that will have your sides splitting and your jaw aching.I for one will miss these films if indeed this one proves to be the last.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
109,sweetboyy_99,One of the best in the trilogy,7,17 March 2015,"We were all shocked by the news of Robin Williams death. It was unexpected. That's why I had a hard time watching this movie. I think a lot of people who watched this agrees that the ending was one of the most emotional ones because it was like a personal 'goodbye' from Robin himself. This is the third (and hopefully last) installment of the Night at the Museum films. I remember watching the first one and coming out of the theatre with joy. Robin had brought us lots of laughter in this world and for that we are thankful, he filled our lives with fairy tales and humor beyond imagination. He was so humble, he was so unselfish that he wanted to make us laugh, and forgot about himself. This is his last film in theaters and It hurts to know that we'll never see him again. But he'll live in our hearts. Night at the Museum 3 was actually better than the second one. Actually, the second one was pretty bad, mostly because of the script. It didn't have the magic that the first one brought. So how does this one perform? It did very well. I laughed with tears in my eyes through almost the entire film and it made me happy. The jokes were funny as usual and wasn't too repetitive like a lot of modern comedy films do. But what really saved this film in my opinion was the ending, it was so heartbreaking, multiple people cried in the theatre and I was one of them. The visual effects were awesome as well, and did not disappoint. People complain that the recycled humor and that it was too childish, but that is what this movie is. For children. And even though it's made for children, adults of all ages can enjoy this one too. When I saw the trailer I knew what to expect; a good-hearted kids film that can be enjoyed by adults, teens and children as well. This is no masterpiece by no means. It's not trying to be. It's trying to be a fun and enjoyable film for all ages. And that's what it lives up to. So if you're expecting this to be a comical masterpiece; you probably wanna watch something else. If you just want to have fun, this is a good movie. If you are a Robin Williams fan, this is also a great watch. Although Robin doesn't get as much screen time as we'd hope, every scene with him is still golden. There's nothing special about the musical score, but it's all right. Nothing to get excited about, though. The best thing is the heartfelt moments and the special effects, they're fun, bright and vibrant and they're satisfying to both children and adults. The ending is what bumped up the score a lot to me. So give it a watch if you want a fun and heartfelt movie!",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
110,jimw-63592,Not Very Good or Funny,2,13 June 2015,"I really enjoyed the first Night at the Museum, the second wasn't bad, but this one was not good. I rented this on Blu ray and found myself fast forwarding at different times. It's just not very funny, kind of corny with a weak plot. It does feature many cameos, but it's not enough to save this movie. I felt like this movie was geared more to children under the age of 12 years old. Ben Stiller just seemed like he was going through the motions, almost like he didn't really want to be involved with this movie. I really hope they don't make another, I personally won't spend a penny on seeing it. I feel sorry for those who may have spent $10 or over to see this in the theater.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

Everything was fine until Rebel Wilson entered, sorry but she ruined the movie. When she wasn't in the movie it was good, I watched it and tried to eliminate her from the scenes and it went fine.

113,thefolenangel,Not how it used to be~~,5,6 January 2015,"---Spoilers--- (((DUH))) I remember the tranquility of the series and the mystic of the magic. However that is exactly what the third and final movie is not.Let me start by pointing out some plot-holes.*-*Hey how do we find that buried secret tomb, the director asked, well let's just leave the boy to fall in it. Like yeaaah, because this is not a big excavation with hundred of people that pass on top of the tomb, however once a little boy - who weight less than an adult passes he falls, because reasons...*-* Once inside the boy takes his flashlight out, because let's be reasonable who doesn't carry one around, just in case you find a secret Egyptian tomb, takes a few steps inside...and then maybe a minute after the fall his father comes, not only does he find him for that short time frame, but he also manages to find a ladder so that he can descend inside.*-* Hey do you know how we can enter that British museum, yeah let's just wait for the guard to start sleeping. Because there are no alarms inside.*-* I can dig that objects modeled after people, animals and etc. can come to life, but statues of centaurs? And does the movie actually suggest that they existed? And if not why didn't anything else - like a fire extinguisher come alive?*-* Hey you know what will be cool, to have a room with just one knight inside, said no museum curator EVEEEER.*-* Do you know how to stop giant metal demon? Just electrocute it, while on top. You ask won't that affect you too? Well it should, but if you are the main protagonist it won't.*-* Hugh Jackman.*-* Director: Okay time to end the series. How to, how to, hm...? Well I will just make the main character quit to become a teacher. Wtf?! And after three years I will return the tablet back, which was where exactly? Well it doesn't matter as long as we get our final shot of Larry sadly, but with smile, watching the museum entry doors.Now you will say, well this is a family/comedy movie, it's not supposed to be logical. And I agree, however even if we exclude this moments, it failed at making me laugh.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
114,mober1996,"Better than I would've thought, a fitting end.",7,8 January 2015,"NATM3 (Night At The Museum 3) was the end of a series (or at least a trilogy) that I have been following ever since it started 8 years ago. It has always been full I light humor and sheer silliness. But this one was just full of emotion. Now, don't get me wrong. It was silly and clever and the same light mood that the two previous movies were. But, honestly, I got hit with a lot more emotion in this movie than I probably should have.First off, Teddy Roosevelt was still played by Robin Williams in this film. One of his last roles in any movie. I saw this, plus the memoriam for him at the end of the film right before the credits, and grew really upset (for obvious reasons).Second, the ending to this movie was way sadder then I could've imagined. It was perfect for this style of movie, but not really what I had expected. The only problem with it was that after the ending, they had a really happy epilogue, which was nice, but after the tear-jerkfest that was the ending, it should have ended there. It was understandable that they had the happy epilogue, but it's not really what I would've wanted as a critic.In general, NATM3 is one of those movies that really, I just saw to say that I had finished the series. But honestly, it was better than I would've thought. But not great. This review was pretty short, but honestly there isn't much that you can really write about this movie.

116,flowertimezones,Very funny,7,6 January 2015,"very funny and light-hearted. No major themes to sort out, just a wild ride with very funny characters. The move to the British Museum was a wise one, allowing for new characters (and it never hurts to have a few British accents). Sir Lancelot is especially engaging and is the museum night watch-woman. Robin Williams is wonderful as Teddy once again and I overheard more that one person whisper a tribute during the film. Ben Stiller's character could be a little less insipid, at times I felt bored when he was on. For someone so funny, a few better lines with better timing would have been good. Went with a lot of people, kids included, and we all loved this film.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
117,mozziecat,The magic has gone,4,28 December 2014,"I was really looking forward to this movie and anticipated a great closer to the other 2 movies which I thoroughly enjoyed. On top of that, it was to be set in London's British museum which is one of my favorites. The movie even started off great but went downhill as soon as it landed in London. It made little use of the wonderful British museum at all - especially the Egyptian part which is vast. The plot also got lost in the corridors as well as the characters - under using Ben Kingsley and overusing a caveman double of Larry - could have done without him in particular. Stand outs were a fight scene inside a painting and the character of Sir Lancelot. The cameo appearance of the 3 original guards was way too short, especially since the set up scene in the beginning keyed in on one of those characters (too bad he couldn't have gone to London), and the cameo of Hugh Jackman needed some editing (maybe 2-3 minutes shaved off that one). The plot attempted to find itself several times, but failed due to overplaying some characters. It seemed to want to say goodbye to everyone rather than tell the story. Last, the British guard was wasted, could have done a lot more with her.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
118,yansenringo,Lollipop Movie,4,17 June 2015,"Watching Night at The Museum is like watching a Cinderella or Snow White, you know what to expect and you got it. The movie looks like it runs out of fuel and try to squeeze everything necessary to keep it alive and worth to watch, with the help of good special effect and cameo!The storyline is waayyy too simple, for a franchise which made a big bucks with its first installment, it feels that they have lack of ideas, no surprise, no twists, just plain. They only try to bring life to more and more statues, as a sweetener, with no clear ideas of the story value. This is like eating lots of candies, sweet but not healthy. tThe roles of Owen Wilson (Jedediah) and Steve Coogan (Octavius) are just contrived, if they are not exist in this movie, it wouldn't hurt at all, and the scene seems to be forced, a Pompeii volcano erupted in a micro scale under the museum? Can you believe it? Dude, it's entertaining but come on, this is too much, don't make it a stupid movie and ruin the whole franchise.Rebel Wilson plays it quite well here, but is this just my feeling or what? I think she's mimicking Melissa McCarthy, interesting but not original.Overall, this movie is wayy below the first and second, not really worth to watch, and the last part of the movie is like saying ""I have no more idea, good bye"". But if you only want to eat candies, you may watch this movie.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
119,Franco_Strydom,The most forced comedy I've seeing.,4,3 January 2015,"Since the first preview of the first ""Night at the Museum"" (Levy 2006) film I thought the story concept was promising. It has so much potential for content, interaction and character; so when the second film came around I was sceptical but pleasantly surprised. Then with the third I was looking forward to walking into the cinema and seeing how they incorporated the London content into the established story and characters. I was disappointed. They hardly used any content regarding London beyond the utterly unrealistic and over the top stereotypical British security guard. They had a treasure trove of narrative potential; access to pretty much limitless character options of which they used less than a hand full and even those weren't of the calibre of Attila the Hun or Teddy Roosevelt. Not that the British don't have that calibre of historical figures that could have made for beautiful, natural comedy, drama, romance, horror or whatever else you might want to generate with a script. The film's writing and story staff more than doubled since the first film and yet somehow they decided to only rehash the same story elements from the previous two films, which makes the narrative frustratingly predictable. I'm not expecting a film like ""Secret of the Tomb"" (Levy 2014) to reinvent the comic or family film wheel but there is no reason to not strive for something more than the first thing you can think of. The direction of the film is forced. Director Levy's desires are visible in most of the scenes which is distracting, especially when the forced, awkward comedy elements are dropped into what was a faster paced scene, or just before or just after a potentially dramatic and/or emotional scene, or instead of a dramatic or emotional scene. This draws the film away from the emotional ending that you expect from the genre and franchise. I find very little else of the film really worth commenting on, the effects are well done, the characters look great in terms of costume and makeup, the sound is quality though the soundtrack isn't specifically memorable. The film falls short in that it feels creatively amateur. The technical side of the film is quite enjoyable and I did enjoy it, but the creative decisions feel like they were made by an inexperienced writing, production and directing team. I get no spirit from this film, like the film makers made it because they'd signed the contract to make it.All and all I'm disappointed. The film drew attention to the act of film making in the cinema and didn't leave mush of a narrative; the most profound character development is presented in passing conversation right at the end of the film and that is disappointing.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
120,warriorspirit,When things pop up into life at night,5,24 January 2016,"There has been a fascination in Hollywood over making movies about inanimate objects popping into life. We all remember some very good examples Pinnochio , Toy story and Jumanji in this sub-genre, but as time has gone on, it appears this genre is losing IQ points or is specifically targeted at children. Recent examples I have seen of this Night at the Musueum 1 and 2, Goosebumps are childish. I am going to stick with NATM for this review, with a bonus review for the second part at the end.The action starts at the strike of midnight when our new Museum guard(Ben stiller) takes his first night shift. There is no backtory, no build up, just bham the action begins and within minutes our guard is already naturalized to a museum where the exhibits all come to life and having arguments with stuffed monkeys, negotiating war tactics with little toy people. In real life of course, if such a thing was suppose to happen, the first reaction would be sheer disbelief and dread, then questioning oneself if one is hallucinating, then perhaps passing out and running out of the door in panic. Later, when the prison guards gets his son and a Phd student on the action, they too react as if it was all natural - ""Oh stuffed lion come alive, that happens everyday""The problems with these movies to be zany, funny and weird they dumb down the movie; dumb down the characters; and dumb down the story. It is not necessary that this sub-genre has to be dumb, as Toystory etc show us these can be intelligent and supported by an internal logic and characters reactions can still be believable. Instead, the characters are clichés you have seen in hundreds of movies before; a divorced father who is trying to win custody of his child; a child that is disappointed his father is a nobody; and the other man whose made a move on his family in his absence -- all have been pieced together to make this shameless quick-buck movie franchise.So as I was saying the movie starts the moment he starts his first night shift -- then there is mayhem; then he starts his second night shift on a warning from management, then there is mayhem. Some of the mayhem is entertaining, a lot of it is shrill and annoying and strictly for kids. The second part at Smithsonian institute is even more aimless, messy and Ben stellar(the actor) looks visibly bored. The real lesson that NATM teaches us is how easy it is to for Hollywood to start a franchise. The plot line for this movie could have been written on a handkerchief.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
121,jonfottland,Not a bad movie but...,7,26 June 2021,The third and final entry if the night at the museum franchise is relatively decent. But it does however has a few problems. Some of its humor feels somewhat dated. Even back in 2014.it also does a lot of similar jokes to the first two movies. Particularly around Octavius' and Jedidiah's height. It's literally the same joke in all three movies. It's also a bit disappointing end of one of the greatest bromances (and maybe also romances) in film history. With that being said: The performances are still great the effects are still decent (apart from that snake thing in the middle of the movie) it's a good sendoff of our favorite character that we have grow so much to love. It's sad that this is one of the final movies from. Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney. But the memories we have gotten from those highly beloved actors are still there. I personally think these movies has one if Robin Williams' most underrated performances ever.,Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
122,TBear6000,I never write reviews on here but I wanted to save any other Night at the Museum fans the trouble of trying to scrub this film from their minds,2,25 December 2014,"I don't really know how this film could have been further from the spirit of the franchise. The ending defeated the entire purpose of the two films that came before it. In each of the other films the main driving goal of the plot was to save the tablet so the museum will keep coming to life. In the first film they fight the old night guards and race through Central Park to see that this happens. In the second film they wage an epic battle at the Smithsonian against creatures from the very Netherworld just to see that this happens. In the third and final film they travel all the way to London to see that this happens....and then just give up and decide that it doesn't matter if they come to life or not; they're fine just being lifeless, inanimate museum displays. If that's the case then what was the point of everything they did before? Why not just let the old night guards have the tablet in the first film and be done with it? They not only basically killed off every single character from the franchise, but they did it for no good reason at all. If it was supposedly so important that this Egyptian family be together (which I find hard to care about since we don't even know these characters) why couldn't the parents just come back to New York? They didn't even try. They were just like ""Nope, we're good being dead"" when every film has been about fighting to stay alive. I have no clue what they were thinking here with this plot.To make it even worse they recast the son, Nick, into this new actor who looks nothing like the other boy who probably would be of a somewhat comparable age so it's beyond me why they did it, but the far worse offense than simple recasting was to change the entire personality of the boy. For the previous two films he was a good kid, precocious, close to his dad and loved that the museum came to live. Now he's a lazy, back-talking punk who wants to drop out of school to be an underground DJ having wild parties at his dad's place at 3 in the morning and who seems to care less about the museum or any of its inhabitants. Why rewrite and ruin a character that way for some tromped up father/son angst that feels forced and falls terribly flat?And to top it all off, not only was the plot severely lacking and filled with holes and ludicrousness (like where was security when Lancelot crashed the Hugh Jackman play?) the film wasn't even funny. I was sitting in a packed theater and there was rarely any laughter at all. I loved the first two films but I couldn't have felt more different about this one. The ending where they killed everyone off was just the cherry on top of the disdain I'd already developed for this. In my mind, the franchise stopped at the second film which had a lovely and perfect ending for all the characters. They should have just left well enough alone but they got greedy to make more money where no more story existed.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

I'm going to miss the series. As for comments about Ben Stiller's acting...he acted to character. In the first movie he didn't smile much except at the ending, why would that change for this one. Sometimes critics really over think a film, sometimes you should just go see it for yourself. If you are worried, see it during the matinée.

The scary scenes weren't too intense for the the kids. I got misty-eyed at the last, very fitting- good bye scene with Robin William's character. It was a great final role.

I was pleasantly surprised to see Mickey Rooney though. Whadd'a life HE'S had! Married to the most beautiful Hollywood actress ever! Ava Gardner, back in the '50's. He died also in 2014, but at a ripe old age. Not like the still very young, Robin. There was a hint of his hidden agenda in his voice. He was, as previously mentioned, 'not his usual energetic self'. This didn't affect the film, though. Only me. I enjoyed the movie nevertheless. However, they changed Ben's son. It kind'a spoiled the authenticity of the movie since everyone else was back from the first two films. Newbie Rebel Wilson was funny as she always is. Falling for a Larry Daly wax look-alike didn't fly with me though. Sir Lancelot was a fresh surprise as was Hugh Jackman doing his ""thang"". I have ""Night At The Museum"" 1 & 2 on Blu-ray DVD's.

Rebel Wilson's acting was hilarious, though. Also, expect to get teary- eyed by Robin Williams' last appearance on the big screen.

129,StepsCheerBSB,Still Missing Something...,7,27 December 2014,"I am a big fan of Ben Stiller but I still have this feeling that these films are missing something. When I first saw Night at the Museum, I was hoping to learn something or they would ""uncover a secret"" (e.g. Night at the Museum meets National Treasure) Ben has the opportunity to take movies like this to the next level yet they fall short. They could have gave us unknown/little known facts and tied that into the story line; that way the children are learning something and the adults are intrigued with new information.On a positive note, I did like the special effects, cameos and the overall plot. Sir Lance-a-lot was very funny and his action scenes were entertaining. It was nice they took this film to the British museum. Since, they did not have the characters from the sequel, I would have liked have seen more human-like ones to carry the story line. Also, Ben could have done without his ""son/Nicky"" in the film, he wasn't funny and did not add any depth to film. Since the original ""son"" is not in this film, the newer one did not have good comedic timing nor connection with the cast or audience. He could have made a cameo or played a museum character and no one would have known the difference. This was a special film since this was one of Robin Williams final movies. The audience in the theater was sad at certain points. He reminded us that he has the ability to make us laugh, which is his magic. The same rings true for Mickey Rooney, his screen time was hilarious as well. Overall, it was a good film, but I disagree with critics saying it was better than the first one.

You should go in knowing it is a kids movie - and that is part of what makes it awesome! As an adult, let your wall down, open your imagination and get enjoy the simpleness of the fun! This is a movie you can take your children to and be completely comfortable - there are no double sided jokes, no dirty humor 'you' will get but will go over your child's head. It is a classy movie in that respect. Both us and the young adults completely loved it and talked about it for days! I cried I laughed, I cried some more and then I laughed again - it was an emotional movie, especially since it was Robin's last movie - the ending was bittersweet. I want there to be more movies but it seems like this may be the last - the reunion at the end is wonderful! The monkey, oh gosh the money is the star!",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

You don't really need to have seen the 2 prequels but it helps. Also it might make you look out for them if you did. Kids and adults will love it.

Some new additions were made too including Dan Stevens and Rebel Wilson. As always the jokes were funny and the storyline was good given that I thought they had already exhausted it with the previous two films.It was easy to watch and set a good pace with it neither moving too fast or too slow.

A swashbuckling romp with all the old characters. For around 1+ hour things were going great with a decent storyline and a few new elements to keep things fresh enough. It was shaping up to get a solid 6.7 score.Then all of a sudden the movie changed. It became a sentimental 20 minute ending. It stunk of arrogance by the creators, who must of thought that these characters meant much more to us than they really do. It was as if each was given their own heart breaking goodbye, it became very dull and uncomfortable. This dragged on an on. At one point I couldn't help from saying aloud ""boring"". I don't think anybody heard but they were probably thinking the same. The final ten minutes or so was very strange indeed and the story just seemed to go off the rails, maybe the creator was setting it up so he can make another one with a few different directions?We watched this on Christmas Day hoping for a fun action packed comedy movie. If we had left after one hour we would of left very happy.

136,london-kidd,A true gift for history fans and comedy lovers,10,22 December 2014,"Night at the Museum is my all time favourite film. love the fun of it, each one is action packed and this third film was an absolute treat. There was no better way to say goodbye to Robin Williams than have his last role in this entertaining comedy. I really hope they make a fourth film, as I love Larry's role within the museum and each character is special. Enjoyed the idea of them going to the British Museum, as I love to go there. Sir Lancelot was a real gem in 'Secret of the Tomb'. Also loved the large involvement of Ahkmenrah and the Egyptian culture. Jedediah and Octavius are my favourite characters, as they bond really well together and it has been great to see them progress through the movies. I thought the writers were creative with how they included both 'miniatures' in the different scenes. The Pompeii scene had me on the edge of my seat - loved it!

When I leave the show I want to be relatively happy I saw it. I was not happy with this one. Sorry! We all go to the movies expecting to be entertained and I definitely was entertained and got my money's worth. That doesn't mean I have to be satisfied with the way a certain movie begins or ends. Although I enjoyed the interaction on screen I have to admit I was a bit preoccupied with knowing Robin Williams was gone and had taken his own life. How depressing. I struggled to enjoy his acting presence on screen while dealing with how sad that this man was apparently terminally unhappy. I had the same melancholy feeling while watching the Wizard of Oz for the 10th time but this time knowing about the stagehand hanging in the background. Once you know it kind of changes things and how you feel. Again I am truly sorry but I simply hated the ending here.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

When the sequel came out, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, I watched it and I loved it even more. And 5 years later the third and final Night at the Museum is released. I went and watched it and found my self disappointment and very confused. First of all, it didn't have that ""thrill"" like the other Nights did. Second of all, it had very little exhibits that I was very anticipated for. I was also confused of why the had to end a great franchise in such a plain and boring way! The plot was almost as stupid as the chickens plot to cross the road for no apparent reason! The only thing they had to do in order to save the exhibits was to give the magical tablet a ""little light!"" And being one of the final films that was released with him in it, it did little to no liberty for Robin Williams! In fact it hurt him if anything at all. If I was granted the ability to go back in time and cancel the film, I would do it. If the film had not been made, I wouldn't feel as bad for myself, or for the people who went and paid for something they thought was going to be even a little good!

There was also a cool section near the end when Dan Stevens ended up with Hugh Jackman.My family said it was alright. My brother liked it (considering he's only 4).This movie gave me a couple of smirks and a giggle.

The storyline was also good (which is hard to do with these types of movies). The same characters returned, along with some awesome additions. I also thought that the length of the movie was perfect.

Ben Stiller was going through the motions, the script was not funny and in many places actually makes you cringe. The only saving grace was Lancealot. The rest of the 'new' characters were just terrible. I don't who thought the story was gripping but they were wrong. Taking the story to London may have been a good idea but the rest of it was complete nonsense. It lacked any really 'baddy' and consequently there was never any real feeling of a threat.

I really enjoyed the fact that new themes in the score were unfolded and the old classic themes came back as well from the other two films as well! Excellent cinematography!

145,gamewolf66,One of the worst films of 2014,2,24 January 2015,"Why does this film keep getting good reviews? I'm truly astounded.I remember seeing this in December 2014, and I don't know how to say it but it was horrendous. And that's coming from someone who enjoyed the previous films. Let's start with the characters. Ben Stiller gives a decent performance as Larry, but this movie made him very boring compared to the other two films. His dialogue was filled with the emotion of a piece of cardboard, which, as you know, is very boring. The characters from the other films return, with Robin Williams' final performance being Teddy Roosevelt. It was an unfitting final performance for such a funny man. He was, however, the only enjoyable character. The monkey is back too, along with the Egyptian prince, cowboy and the Roman soldier. I don't quite remember their names. Also, Sacajawea (Spelling?), an important character in the last films, gets a total of 2 lines of dialogue. I counted. There's also Lancelot, who serves as a hero for the first half of the film. There's also Larry's son in the movie, but he adds absolutely nothing to the overall plot. And need I not mention Rebel Wilson's character? Her British accent is terrible and she is an unfunny and boring character. All the other characters are uninteresting. Then there's the plot. It seems that the Magic Tablet that lets the exhibits in the Museum come alive is corroding, causing the exhibits to act weirdly/and/or violently. So they must travel to Britain in order to find Egyptian guy's father, who can help fix the tablet. But first, we get cameos from the three villains of the first movie. This is called padding out a film to increase its run time. After going to Britain, the meet Rebel Wilson and get chased through the British Museum. Lame jokes and boring fight scenes ensue. They meet Lancelot, who helps them. Then he's evil. (I actually didn't see that coming.) Lancelot steals the tablet and the gang must find him before the tablet is destroyed. I won't spoil the rest, but it was a painful and unfunny movie. The jokes were either about outdated pop culture references, or were just unfunny entirely. The characters were stupid, unfunny, and hard to care about. The plot moves unexpectedly quickly for a Night at the Museum movie, which makes me feel like I didn't get to follow much of the plot. Also, Hugh Jackman makes a pointless cameo near the end of this fiasco of a movie. I don't even know why I watched this. Robin Williams deserves a better final movie.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
146,heffe-50874,Spoiler alert,1,30 May 2015,"Warning spoilers ahead.I joined this site just to warn people. The Eurocentrism in this movie is unforgivable. Why does everyone speak English except Atilla? If the magic tablet gives everyone the ability to speak Modern American English, then Atilla should, too. It is somewhat plausible however, that the cave men might not possess the capacity of language. And why does Jedediah have a ""cowboy"" accent? By that reasoning, Lancelot should use ye olde English. By the way, Lancelot is probably the most good and noble knight in Aurthurian Legend. He only had one failing, which was his adulterous affair with Guinevere. The Lancelot in this movie is more like Mordred. This is because he has modern Eurocentric values mixed in with his ""historic"" values. This was somewhat tolerable with the previously mentioned Jedediah in the first two movies having a mix of modern and historical values, but it was both unnecessary and overwhelming to have ALL the new ""historical"" characters have this dual nature. It is like they all have multiple personality disorder. I would not waste any money on this movie. You might want to watch it if it comes with a subscription service like netflix or amazon instant, but make sure you brush up on your ignorance.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
147,forgoodmusic,Pretty darn funny,10,9 December 2016,"Hi everyone I want to write a few sentences on my thoughts on ""Night At The Museum 3"" first it was unique a little artsy even. It features Ben Stiller and Robin Williams, and those two have always been quite funny! Sad about Robin dying before the film was released. And Mickey Rooney died too also sad. But the talent the late great Robin Williams contributed to this film was astronomical it is a gift he had and he seemed to understand people. So he , Robin looked quite natural in the movie talking and being the role he was cast as! He did wonderful! Ben was convincing and his son , now at a late or nearly late teens age (17ish) is playred by Skyler Gisondo. My favorite scene with Skyler is in which Ben Stiller , ""Larry"" comes home and whoa what a party is going on all organized by the young but 17,18 ,young Skyler, who isn't quite sure next year should mean college. Ha funny ....and my favorite character addition ? The little monkey I think that makes for some funny scenes try this one you'll like it ..p.s the first ""Nicky,"" was played by a talented little kid in previous ""Night At The Museum,"" but Skyler is certainly good as a high school senior and this whole movie keeps you guessing in a positive way. The British female cop , is a funny addition heh",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
148,e-07281,night at the museum secret of the tomb,9,2 October 2017,"One last night at the museum At the Museum of Natural History, there's a new exhibit being unveiled. Larry Daley, who manages the night exhibit where the exhibits come to life because of the Tablet of Ahkmenrah, is in charge of the presentation. But when the exhibits go awry, Larry finds himself in trouble. He learns the Tablet is corroding so he does some research and learns that Cecil, the former museum guard, was at the site when the Tablet was discovered. He tells Larry they were warned if they remove it could mean the end. Larry realizes it means the end of the magic. He talks to Ahkmenrah who says that he doesn't know anything. Only his father the Pharoah knows the Tablet's secrets. He learns that the Pharaoh was sent to the London museum. We all know the premise; a special Egyptian tablet makes it possible for all the exhibits in the museum to come to life at night. What I'm glad about is that this third film is not a rehash of the previous two; its predecessors had a similar theme of the main villain wanting the table,t which were different enough to enjoy but Secret of the Tomb does something completely different with its plot and execution which is an awesome change I enjoyed a lot. Of course, another thing we enjoy with these movies is the actual museum coming to life and they do some really cool stuff with that idea and it's awesome to see these historical figures interact with statues and even paintings!To make it even worse they recast the son, Nick, into this new actor who looks nothing like the other boy who probably would be of a somewhat comparable age so it's beyond me why they did it, but the far worse offense than simple recasting was to change the entire personality of the boy. For the previous two films, he was a good kid, precocious, close to his dad and loved that the museum came to live. Now he's a lazy, back- talking punk who wants to drop out of school. Underground DJ having wild parties at his dad's place at 3 in the morning and who seems to care less about the museum or any of its inhabitants. Why rewrite and ruin a character that way for some tromped up father/son angst that feels forced and falls terribly flat?I think that I know of I don't know. I would recommend it to my family.

With that in mind, I managed to avoid extreme disappointment like I should, and the movie did surprise me a bit with a whole new set and characters which took place in the London's museum background, and some decent scenes with good and awe special effects. It did entertain some common spectators, which is why I gave it a 5.But that was pretty much all my impression with the film. Like I expected, jokes fell flat, watching Ben Stiller acting is like watching my chair all day, the old characters except for Robin Williams don't even have a single remarkable quote, they just run around screaming and being useless for 98 minutes, the Pharaoh's story and secrets is beyond lame and has nothing to do with the reason why the tablet are causing problems. The opening scenes wasted all it's potential and has little to none connections with the rest of the movie, never knew why Larry's son is involved in this story, and he even took us a HUGE amount of screen time.Perhaps if you're not really a movie fan but a casual cinema viewer, you might be lucky enough to enjoy this movie.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

His museum friends are in danger, for the tablet of Akmenrah is deteriorating from its magic. So Daley works with some new and old friends in order to restore the tablet. The film relies on the star power of its returning cast (Wilson, Coogan, Williams, Stiller). The jokes are rather juvenile, they will fall flat for preteens and older. Here and there you'll find yourself smiling, especially in Ben Kingsley's cameo. He appears for a few minutes, and does the best he can with a project like this. The film may be a tear jerker. This is Robin Williams' last film appearance that I know of, and the resolution of his character is more powerful than that of the other's. However, it isn't the way most would want to say goodbye to a legend. Overall, NATM 3 is a well done family film that you should feel safe bringing your kids to.

While the story and plot are not the best that you will ever find, it is a fun movie that is very family friendly. As Robin Williams' last film, it is very sentimental to see him one last time on the screen. He gives yet another great performance as Teddy Roosevelt.Overall, this gives the trilogy a very nice finish, but also leaves room for another sequel with Larry's son or Rebel Wilson's character, Tilly. A story line with Wilson could bring a new life to the series, but with Williams' untimely death and an awkward love with a caveman, I doubt that we will see this.

164,ilovepuppiesforever,Best Movie Ever!,9,1 May 2015,"This third movie would teach us a very important lesson. At the end of the movie where they all decided that the gold pad has to stay with the Egyptians in England, all the figures were sad and didn't want to do. Ben Stiller, that last minutes goodbye were emotional and tears couldn't stop streaming down my face. Everyone were sad to go and Ben didn't know what he was going to do if the museum doesn't come alive at night anymore. This might have taught me an important lesson. It taught me that at some point in life, we're going have give up something in life, even if it's really hard. But in life, we have to move on and get on with life.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb

166,ird-90915,This movie is awesome,8,6 December 2017,"in my mind, this movie is awesome. This movie contains magic about of the tomb. It can revive all of the exhibits. And they can walk, talk and some of them love each other. This movie was the most interesting movie i've ever watched. I decided to go to the museum nearly. There are many special scenes and funny moves. It isn't possible in real life but it is really enjoyed. If you didn't watch this movie I advice you to watch this film. Highly recommended.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
167,ganaa-40812,Astonishing,8,12 December 2017,"This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. Levy used all characters from its previous version of this movie and obviously comfortable with Levy's directing style and the film's dramatic tone.
It was brilliant! i have almost lost all my adventures and interests of my life. Thanks to this wonderful film. One thing i didn't like was an expression of the caretaker's son, that was dreadful. I think Levy shouldn't have chosen that actor.
However, rest of the content and actors were okay, just like usual.",Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb
