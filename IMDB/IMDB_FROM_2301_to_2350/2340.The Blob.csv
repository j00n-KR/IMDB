0,Leofwine_draca,Wonderful monster flick is one of the best remakes ever,10,4 December 2015,"Remakes of classic films are usually terrible (especially with the likes of PSYCHO and GODZILLA), but a handful of them are actually rather good, and in some cases improve on the original, which was the case with Cronenberg's remake of THE FLY. THE BLOB happily falls into the latter category, being a adrenaline-pumping tale which mixes horror elements, science fiction moments and has the speed and energy of an action film. While the 1950s original classic starring Steve McQueen was a good, original, monster movie with some frightening moments, it was somewhat lacking in the special effects department, and what effects there were just weren't enough to do it justice. This is where the 1988 remake of THE BLOB comes in.The special effects are spectacular and especially gruesome this time around. In the scenes where a large-scale Blob is attacking people, back projection is obviously being used just like it was in THE STUFF, but this does not detract from the entertainment value. There is a high death rate in the film, and lots of spectacular and bloody deaths mostly involving people melting and being enveloped in the Blob's tentacles, and it's pleasing to see that the effects are not at all CGI-generated, like the similarly slimy tentacles were in DEEP RISING.To move the film along, there are a lot of chase scenes, on motorcycles, in sewers, in the streets, everywhere really. These make the film feel a lot like a roller-coaster ride, and that's exactly what it is. The acting is good all-round, from Shawnee Smith as the tough heroine to Kevin Dillon as the outsider who turns out to be a good guy, with support from a creepy Reverend. All of the actors put in over the top performances in terms of emoting, which is amusing, and they thankfully don't take themselves too seriously. THE BLOB sticks (no pun intended), in terms of plot, to the '50s original, but fleshes out the story a lot (even adding in an up-to-date government conspiracy angle), and generally feels to be a bigger, more packed film. Not a minute goes by without something exciting happening. If you're looking for solid escapist entertainment, then THE BLOB is for you.",The Blob
1,SnoopyStyle,Good cheesy fun,6,2 October 2013,"Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon) is the town teen delinquent. Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith) is the high school head cheerleader. An alien asteroid lands carrying a deadly blob lifeform that consumes everything. Nobody believes when the blob eats Meg's boyfriend.There is some good cheesy fun to be had here. Taking the '59 B-horror classic, it doesn't really need to add much more. Kevin Dillon has the fluffy hair. He needs to do something more than a 1950's cartoon of a ruffian. He's not a bad actor otherwise. Shawnee Smith is cute and compelling. They're both good at taking this cheese seriously.The one thing that bugged me is the lack of reason from the cops. The people at the hospital were definitely killed by something extraordinary. Yet they talk like it's a regular murder case. But you have to allow for B-horror reasoning.There is some good gore and creature feature scares. As a story, it works pretty well and quite effective. It does run into problems when the blob becomes big CG. The graphics at the time just can't do it justice.",The Blob
2,mark.waltz,A frightening remake that really works.,6,5 October 2021,"Okay so it is lacking the campy elements of the original (including the delightful title song), but it is consistently entertaining and suspenseful and frightening and occasionally very funny, with the occasional gross visuals that in this case works. Kevin Dillon takes on the Steve McQueen role at the likeable rebel and you root for him to defeat this hideous mass of goo. What is really frightening though is that you like almost all of the characters including many of the victims and to see them dispatched in this hideous way is disturbing as it occurs.The plot has been altered to where the reason for the blob makes a bit more sense, and Joe Seneca as a government official is a terrific villain. There's a cynical priest, a lovable waitress, her sheriff boyfriend and various teenagers trying to get it on who do nothing but get something else off (mostly heads and limbs), and the action never stops.Among the humorous moments are inquiries of insurance of the initial victim, the sick but funny visuals of what remains of the victims inside the massive, increasing blob and Dillon's comical asides. This was a fun popcorn movie when I first saw it in the theater in 1988, and over 30 years later, still stands the test of time with impressive special effects, and a sequence in the small town's sewer system that is as intense as the desperation to get away from the flooding waters in ""Titanic"". Del Close as the reverend is rather creepy looking, eerily from the moment he comes across a teen buying condoms. Of course the iconic movie theater sequence is utilized, a nice tribute to the original. The ending leaves hints for a sequel that didn't come for years and was too little, too late.",The Blob
3,gavin6942,A Remake Well Worth Making,8,12 March 2007,"A meteorite crashes on Earth and an alien life form escapes, hungry for human flesh. Soon, the slimy creature grows to a very massive size and threatens an entire town. But wait until you find out where the creature came from! We have an all-star cast: Kevin Dillon, the lesser of the Dillon brothers, Shawnee Smith (hidden by her atrocious 1980s hair), Erika Eleniak (""Baywatch"", ""Under Siege""), Candy Clark (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Cat's Eye"", ""Q: The Winged Serpent""). With Frank Darabont helping to write this script, it should come as no surprise that actor Jeffrey DeMunn appears -- Darabont and DeMunn seem to be inseparable. There is a story here, but who knows what it is. Darabont and director Chuck Russell had worked together on two previous horror films, ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" and ""Hell Night"".The use of the classic pharmacist urban legend as part of the plot was clever, and somewhere in here Bill Moseley shows up as a soldier (hint: it is in the sewer). Although this was after ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"", he was apparently not a big enough genre star to get much notice.The special effects are amazing. Rick Baker protégé Tony Gardner is responsible for this, and his work ranks right up there with Rob Bottin, the best in the business. Mike Mayo trashes the film, saying, ""Remake of a perfectly good original is predictably pointless and overblown with a barfbag full of graphic effects."" He goes on to say at some points the effects do not surpass the 1958 version. Mayo is a great reviewer, but he is wrong. Shawnee Smith says the blob was constructed using an ingredient found in McDonald's Shamrock Shakes... whether true or not, it moves and reacts in a very lifelike, and terrifying, manner. To say this effect (which calls to mind Bottin's work ""The Thing"") is no better than effects from 1958 is just wrong. And as much as remakes are generally despised (rightly so), and possibly ""pointless"" as Mayo asserts, this one meets a certain standard that allows it to rival its predecessor, not unlike John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"". This is a fun little film that takes nothing away from the original, and gives off an 80s sentimentality that is hard to dislike.This film is the clear predecessor of James Gunn's ""Slither"", which also features an alien life form that comes in a meteorite and infects a whole town. So, thank you blob, you laid the foundation for the best horror film of 2006.",The Blob
4,lee_eisenberg,an acceptable remake,7,14 October 2005,"Usually, when they attempt a remake of a classic sci-fi/horror flick, they bungle it beyond redemption. ""The Blob"" is actually a pretty good remake, elaborating the original's story. In this case, the protagonist - aside from the title character - is punk Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon). The movie's strength comes from the intrigue that it portrays.Needless to say, now that the censorship laws had eased, they were able to add in some more things. I'll never forget the sink scene (as I call it). And, as I understand it, Donovan starred in this movie (or was it someone else with the name Donovan Leitch?). Oh well, the point is that they eked out a good movie with this remake.",The Blob
5,ma-cortes,New remake with high grade special effects and amazing killings,6,14 September 2007,"This new version from the Steve McQueen's camp classic with more gore and guts than original that was shot with low budget.Again deals about a small town besieged by an enormous, man-eating amoebic mass and fast-growing that land over earth from exterior space.Our hero(Kevin Dillon)is a rebellious young man who saves the damsel(Shawnee Smith)in distress and taking on policeman(Jeffrey DeMoon)and scientific(Joe Seneca).This high budget film contains noisy action, suspense, grisly murders and lots of blood and gore. This sequel provides great load of screams, terror, creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the mound of glop appearing. It's a sleek production with genuine chills, tension, shocks and nice special effects by Dream Quest, making an exciting slimy jello invader and frightening and horrifying to the audience. This remake rips off Irvin S. Yeaworth's version(again remade by Larry Hagman in ¨Beware, the Blob¨) like when the large Glob exploding through the theater screen(meanwhile the spectators are watching a splatter film , Friday,13-alike) and people stampede from cinema, among others. The film packs a good cinematography by Mark Irwin with ominous camera angles, colorful atmospheres and moody woods. The motion picture is well directed by Chuck Russell,who made the third and best version of ¨Nightmare on Elm Street¨. Rating : Acceptable and passable. Well worth watching. This is a cool tribute to the original movie.",The Blob
6,BA_Harrison,Top-notch monster movie delivers the goods!,9,9 July 2006,"Oozing with 80s style and dripping with top-notch gory FX, Chuck Russell's big-budget remake of the 50s classic, The Blob, is a blast from start to finish. With a screenplay co-written by Russell with Frank 'The Shawshank Redemption' Darabont, the script bristles with snappy B-movie dialogue and memorable scenes making The Blob one of the best monster movies of the last 20 years.Kevin Dillon (Matt's younger brother) ably plays Brian Flagg, an archetypal loner-rebel-in-a-small-town, who, along with sexy cheerleader Meg (Shawnee Smith), does battle with the titular glob of deadly pink goo.Arriving from outer space aboard a flaming meteorite, the creature dissolves and devours everyone in its path, growing in size with every victim. Absolutely no-one is safe from the amorphic acidic mass and part of the joy of Russell's retelling is that he deliberately kills off characters you would normally expect to survive such a film in order to catch the audience off-guard. The impact of these deaths is made even greater by the manner in which the blob devours its prey, excreting acid and melting them until their features liquefy beyond recognition.Of course, the effects are the real stars of the film, and for the most part they are very impressive. The monster itself is a wonderfully realised creation, resembling a hideous mass of quivering internal organs. One can only be grateful that this movie was made before the advent of CGI; nowadays, the blob would be rendered digitally and something would definitely be lost in the process.The gruesome death set-pieces are equally fantastic. From the moment we witness the semi-dissolved remains of the first unfortunate to cross the creature's path, we know the makers won't hold back on the gore. Highlights include a man being pulled down a plughole, Erika Eleniak's face being pulled inside out, some truly yucky melted corpses and Robocop's Paul McCrane being snapped in half.This is popcorn horror at its best and any self-respecting fan of the genre should see this movie.",The Blob
7,paul_haakonsen,The ooze from outer space...,6,25 June 2017,"I remember watching this 1988 remake of ""The Blob"" during my teenage years, and it was an entertaining movie back then. In fact, I have watched it several times since then.""The Blob"" is indeed somewhat of a classic in its own rights. And it is definitely a movie that has withstood the test of time quite well. I introduced it to my wife in 2017, and while she was a bit skeptical at first, she was won over and ended up thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The story in the movie is a very typical Sci-Fi story; a foreign body from outer space comes to Earth, where it turns into a deadly and unstoppable killer. Sure, it is a bit generic in terms of originality, but it uses a well-established formula, so it actually works out quite well.Taking into consideration that the movie is from 1988, then I must say that the special effects were actually amazing for its time, and they actually still prove to be good even today. Sure, there were some questionable scenes where you could clearly see that the ooze was fake, but in overall, then it was rather impressive.Granted, I have actually never seen the 1958 original version, so I cannot compare this remake to the original.The cast in ""The Blob"" was quite good, although it was very late 1980s, of course. You have Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith in the lead roles. Furthermore, the movie also have some nice appearances by Jeffrey DeMunn, Paul McCrane, Erika Eleniak, and also horror icon Bill Moseley himself. So there are some very familiar faces on the cast list. People were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters, and they helped bring the story to life quite nicely on the screen.As for the characters in the movie, well I have to say that they are somewhat stereotypical and generic for a Sci-Fi horror movie. But the script and the storyline overshadows this, so you quickly forget about these one-dimensional characters. However, I somehow have a problem with grasping how a Christian minister goes from being a devout Christian into a doomsday preacher just because of what happened to him in the movie. And also, just how did he know what that pinkish crystalline material was, and why did he save it? It just made no sense, except for lining up a potential sequel.""The Blob"" is a very entertaining movie, and it is the type of movie that you can watch again and again with some time passing in between each viewing.",The Blob
8,BandSAboutMovies,I love this one!,8,28 October 2018,"Just like the original, The Blob starts with a meteor crash being investigated by an old man and his dog. But unlike that 1950's science fiction film, this movie exists to confounding expectations. It spends so much time setting up Paul (Donovan Leitch) and Meg (Shawnee Smith, Saw) as the leads that when Paul is eaten by the Blob early in the film, it really comes across as a surprise. The real hero is Brian (Kevin Dillon), who is constantly in trouble with the cops and always rides a Triumph motorcycle, a nod to the star of the original, Steve McQueen.For the rest of the film's running time, Meg and Brian have to convince the town that the Blob is real. By the end, they're trying to expose the fact that whatever the Blob is, it's not from space. No, it's a U.S. government made weapon.The Blob is packed with familiar faces, like Jack ""Eraserhead"" Nance as a doctor, Candy Clark as a doomed waitress, Second City braintrust Del Close as a priest who starts to worship The Blob, Paul McCrane as a cop (he'll always be Emil Antonowsky in RoboCop to me) and Bill Moseley as a memorable soldier who mutters a strange soliloquy about The Blob before dying.The credit for this movie being a sequel that actually works belongs to the team of Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont, who started working together on the film Hell Night and co-wrote A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. There's enough to remind you of the original while aspiring to be a movie on its own merits. It may have been a box office failure, but time has been quite kind to this movie.",The Blob
9,Coventry,"Evil, outer space Flubber",7,22 October 2003,"While writing this review, the word ""remake"" has grown out to be a real taboo ! During the last 5 years or something, horror fans have been overwhelmed by shameful and despicable remakes of ancient classics and there are yet a lot more to come. You'd almost forget that, back in the 80's, they were able to do a great job remaking some forgotten favorites. You have - of course - John Carpenter's The Thing, David Cronenberg's The Fly and also this version of The Blob is more than decent. This movie is an update on a personal 50's SciFi classic of mine starring the legendary Steve McQueen.
Furthermore, The Blob is typically eighties !!***small spoilers, perhaps *** The popular football-jock, the adorable cheerleader, the outcast rebel saving the day and so on and so on...They're all there ! The story is about a quiet town being brutally disturbed by a huge flashy fluid that fell on earth like a meteor. It appears to eat people completely in order to grow bigger. Just when it seems like the town is totally out of hope, a government service arrives. These science-men were prepared for this to happen and they came to isolate the village. But...are they really there to help them ??? ***end spoilers ***The Blob is a good combination of enjoyable horror ( even a bit of entertaining gore ) and comedy. I say comedy because the evil flubber has some very original ways to kill people from time to time ( ever seen a normal-sized man getting sucked into a discharge ?) Director Chuck Russel ( he's also the only one who was ever able to make a decent Nightmare on Elm Street sequel ) succeeds here in creating a light-headed atmosphere without ruining the creepy plot idea. Also a nice to know detail is that Frank Darabont helped in writing the screenplay. This guy later gained much respect for his movie The Shawshank Redemption. In conclusion, a few words about the acting performances... Kevin Dillon never did many leading roles, but he certainly proves here that he can pull it off. Especially in a smaller production. And Shawnee Smith is a beautiful girl who regretfully never made a big break in Hollywood. She's done quite a few things, but nothing really important. If you like her as well, I suggest you check out the TV-series ""Becker"". She has a lovely part in that series.
Favorite ""rewind""-scene : the only really creepy scene is the one in the cinema. Meg wants to get her brother out of there but there's chaos all over the place and, because of the light effects, this becomes a pretty scary scene.",The Blob

12,Theo Robertson,Mean And Nasty Remake,6,16 August 2010,"THE BLOB follows in the footsteps of THE THING and THE FLY as being 1950s science fiction films remade in the 1980s all of which had mixed fortunes . John Carpenters remake of THE THING totally bombed at the box office , though it's now considered a classic . Cronenbergs remake of THE FLY was a big hit and is still fondly remembered perhaps because there were strong human elements amongst the gore and effective make up . THE BLOB remake from 1988 directed by Chuck Russell opened to very lukewarm reviews and disappeared after spending a total of one week in the American top ten box office . It's not a particularly good horror film but one would have expected it to do better since gory horror were very fashionable in that decade The screenplay co written by Rusell and Frank Darabont ( The director of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ) takes the basic structure of the original and embellish it . Unfortunately whilst the original is remembered as a rather camp affair the remake tries to shock and disturb the audience This is summed up by the scene in the cinema . The heroine Meg sees a patron lying on the ground , she turns her over only to find a face that has been totally eaten away by the blob . Some commentators have mentioned that this film has a mean streak and they're right, it's actually quite sadistic . People die graphic deaths . Men , women and children all become victims of the blob regardless if they deserved to die horribly or not , which seems to clash with the light hearted tone in the early part of the movie The is an interesting plot twist that the screenwriters have brought to this version . I say interesting but I don't necessarily think it's a good one and that is the eponymous blob was created by military scientists . It's interesting in that it goes against the grain of what was coming out of Hollywood at the time where John Rambo and his action clones were traveling across the world killing commies . and in many ways this version of THE BLOB mirrors George A Romero's THE CRAZIES with white suited soldiers holding a middle American town hostage . Sadly the villain Dr Meadows is written and acted with no moral ambiguity and is such an obvious baddie that he's impossible to believe in as a real character when the potential for a multi-layered character was there Looking on the bright side this is a movie made before the advent of CGI so that means we have a big man eating jelly that wasn't created on a computer . It doesn't always convince however and isn't helped by a lack of internal continuity where some people are dissolved out of existence but some others are still recognisable when they're absorbed like the sheriff during the phone booth scene . Being a 1980s film also means the fashions have badly dated and if you think Kevin Dillion has a bad hairstyle they you'll be shocked to know a mullet was the height of fashion in those days . Now that really is frightening",The Blob
13,Hey_Sweden,There's always room for The Blob...,8,28 May 2012,"In the tradition of other horror remakes from the 1980s such as ""The Thing"" and ""The Fly"", the 1988 version of ""The Blob"" takes full advantage of the advances made in special effects, creating one Hell of a memorable monster.It's descended to Earth, specifically a small town named Arborville, after its time in space, and proceeds to devour any and all residents of the town. The unlikely young hero is motorcycle riding rebel Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon, sporting an awesome 80s hairdo), assisted by the equally unlikely heroine, cheerleader Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith).It's simply a delight to see Ms. Smith metamorphose from homecoming queen type to a teen aged, small town Ellen Ripley, screaming at The Blob, ""You can do better than that!"" as she shoots at it. The characters are refreshingly more than one dimensional - Brian is not such a bad guy (after all, he's a punk, not a killer), and the sheriff (Jeffrey DeMunn), who would ordinarily be the guys' nemesis, isn't really out to get him and is a very reasonable man. Also, writer / director Chuck Russell and writer Frank Darabont treat all characters as fair game, including children.The energy is fantastic as this speedy story, which takes place in under 24 hours, races through one highly entertaining sequence after another. The Blob effects are excellent, as the hungry mass obliterates one unlucky victim after another. The scene where the diner employee pays the price for attempting to ""plunge"" The Blob is undeniably the highlight. Great atmosphere, cinematography (by Mark Irwin), music (by Michael Hoenig), and humour combine with a phenomenal cast full of familiar faces - Del Close, Paul McCrane, Art La Fleur, Bill Moseley, Frank Collison, Jack Nance, Erika Eleniak, Julie McCullough, Jamison Newlander, and Charlie Spradling. Candy Clark is wonderful as DeMunns' would be love interest, and there's a nice bit of colour blind casting as lovable old pro Joe Seneca (""Crossroads"") plays the resident mad scientist.The movie gets off to a nice, subtly ominous start and is a total blast right through its end credits, with a kick ass song titled ""Brave New Love"" by the group Alien. The ending lends itself to a sequel, and it's really too bad that to date there hasn't been one.If one is a newcomer to and fan of 1980s sci-fi & horror, ""The Blob"" comes highly recommended.Eight out of 10.",The Blob
14,preppy-3,Only a 5.4 rating? This film is FUN!,8,7 May 2004,"A meteor falls near a small town in the USA.  A homeless man goes to see what's in it and a jelly-like substance ""attacks"" him and starts eating away at him.  He's discovered by local tough kid Kevin Dillon and (with pretty Shawnee Smith and prettier Donovan Leitch) drive him to the hospital.  There he's eaten alive while waiting for the doctor and the blob is loose--eating anything in its path. But, in no time flat, a bunch of scientists and military men arrive to help...or are they?I HATED the original one...and I don't care if it was Steve McQueen's first film (he was always a lousy actor anyways).  It was slow, stupid with terrible special effects and a VERY slow-moving blob.  This one has a very funny script that never takes itself too seriously; it moves very quickly; this blob moves like lightning (I was actually getting scared when it chased Smith and Dillon in the diner--you see it following them on the ceiling--and GAINING!); has some great, scary special effects (and no crummy CGI); proudly gives us an R rated horror film (today it would have been cut to a PG-13) and has mostly great acting.  Also the taboo about killing kids in a horror film is surprisingly ignored!Smith (who I thought was hopeless in ""The Desperate Hours"") is surprisingly very good here; Leitch is good too (and prettier than her) but disappears early on; and there's a great supporting cast of good actors with especially nice turns by Candy Clark and Jeffrey DeMunn.  Only Dillon disappoints--he's pretty wooden in his role.  And I REALLY hated the ""origin"" given for the blob--it was totally unnecessary.  And the very end was silly (and an obvious setup for the sequel that never was made).  This was a big hit with horror fans--but didn't do much at the box office.  Too bad.  Maybe it will be rediscovered one of these days.A quick, fast, funny, scary film with great special effects.  Well worth catching.  I'm giving it an 8.",The Blob

16,poolandrews,"'If it's a germ it's the biggest son of a bitch you've ever seen!' An enjoyable, better than expected big budget remake, prepare to be Blob smacked!",8,13 December 2004,"The Blob opens to the eerie and totally deserted streets of a small American town called Arborville. Everyone is at the big game. One of the football players Paul Taylor (Donovan Leitch) asks an attractive cheerleader out named Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith). That night an old man (Billy Beck) who lives out in some woods near Arborville sees a flaming meteorite land nearby. He investigates, he sees a purple jelly substance moving around inside. He unwisely decides to poke it with a stick. The purple jelly slides along the stick and attachés itself to his hand. The towns local petty criminal Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon) is repairing his bike when the old man jumps out from behind some tress at him and tries to cut his own hand off with an axe. The man disappears into the woods, Flagg runs after him. Paul and Meg are on their date when the old man runs out in front of their car and is hit. Paul and Meg take the old man and Flagg to the local hospital. Before long the old man has been more or less completely eaten by the blob and decides Paul looks tasty as well. The blob is loose, it's growing at an extraordinary rate and will eat anything or anyone that moves! The local police, Sheriff Herb Gellar (Jeffery DeMunn) and his deputy Bill Briggs (Paul McCrane) don't believe a word of their story to begin with, but as the population of Arborvile rapidly decreases they have a race against time to stop the blob before it eats the entire town and possibly the whole of America! Then all of a sudden white suited Government agents turn up, lead by the sinister Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca) and Colonel Hargis (Jack Rader), and it soon becomes clear that they aren't the towns saviours as they try and make out. Co-written and directed by Chuck Russell I thought this was a very enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare it but I would imagine this is superior. The script by Russell and Frank Darabont is interesting throughout, entertaining, not too clichéd, has just about enough character development without becoming boring and it keeps things moving at a nice pace. Most of the characters are adults with Meg and Brian as the teenage love interest, the script plays the film straight without any jokey one liners. Acting is OK, Dillon looks a bit uninterested and somewhat flat at times but it's not a huge problem. This also features an early appearance by future Baywatch (1989-1992) star Erika Eleniak as a character who implodes as the blob oozes out of her. The blob effects are pretty cool, and there is a surprising amount of gory deaths including a sequence where an unlucky man named George (Clayton Landey) gets pulled down a plughole by the blob head first, I was impressed. I liked it, a good solid 80's horror film all round. Certainly worth a watch, recommended.",The Blob
17,utgard14,Way Better Than the Original,6,21 April 2014,"Mysterious blob consumes everything and everyone in its path. Two teenagers (Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillon) try to warn everybody. Remake of the 1958 film but it's rare for a remake in that it not only matches the original but surpasses it. Great pace, lots of humor, good special effects. Shawnee Smith, with the smile that launched a million crushes, is incredibly likable and rootable. Kevin Dillon may look silly with his long hair, leather jacket, and motorcycle (is this the '50s?), but he's very funny and one of the best parts of the movie. Jeffrey DeMunn and (surprisingly) Candy Clark offer good support. I say surprisingly as I've been very critical of Clark in other movies. This one's a lot of fun. The '50s meets the '80s.

18,Boba_Fett1138,Aamzing that the '50's B-monster movie version was way more exciting and entertaining than this one.,4,5 December 2010,"People keep saying how this movie is fun to watch as a spoof and satire on the genre, while in fact it was the 1958 movie that did a much better job at not taking itself too serious. Something that did movie could had learned a lot from.This is really a hard movie to get into because it simply isn't an either very exciting or interesting one to watch. There are several reasons as to why. First of all the characters just aren't being really likable or well written enough. They are quite flat and bland and it makes you wonder why the movie is focusing on these characters, while a different approach with different characters would had made the story at least whole lot more interesting to follow. Which brings me to the movie its second problem; it's being too much of a lackluster and too much of a bore. This is not necessarily because there aren't enough killings, or action happening but more because there is never really a good sense of danger in the movie. It also makes the movie fall flat as an horror. You could say that this is also mostly due to the treatment of the blob. It seems to pop up at random places, for some unexplained reason and is more of a monster with tentacles and all than a scary slow moving, all consuming, single cell entity, there is no escaping off and can't be stopped by anything.So no, I just couldn't really enjoy watching this movie, despite its hard efforts to still make this a fun movie to watch. It instead makes this movie more often a ridicules one to watch, since it allows its story to feature some highly unlikely- and just plain silly, bad written, elements. I'm talking about especially the stuff involving the military. This seriously could had better been left out and it perhaps would had strengthened the small town- and desolated feeling and atmosphere of the movie.Needless to say that you are better off watching the original.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Blob
19,view_and_review,The Blob is out of place in 1988,3,17 January 2007,"I was trying to watch the movie as though it was still 1988, my childhood years even, but I still didn't like it. The Blob was just soooo corny. I think the only thing cornier would be The Attack of the Killer Tomatos. I mean, who thought a gelatinous mass of red goo would be a credible monster. When I think of a good horror movie I think, ""Will thoughts of this monster keep me awake at night?"" And after having thought that, the answer was a resounding ""NO!"". The Blob wouldn't even make a cameo appearance in my mildly unpleasant dreams. I'm just not frightened by the idea of my cherry Jello eating me or dissolving me. Apparently this was a remake of a 1958 film with the same title. Maybe in 1958 there was a story going around of a kid whose chewed up bubble gum came alive and ate him so the movie had some type of credibility. But in 1988, after having seen Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and a host of other scary movies, The Blob just doesn't belong.",The Blob
20,george.schmidt,"Nifty, nasty remake of a true sci-fi orig. classic",9,27 February 2003,"THE BLOB (1988) *** Kevin Dillon, Shawnee Smith, Donovan Leitch, Joe Seneca, Candy Clark. Excellent remake of the sci-fi camp classic with rebel Dillon and cheerleader Smith battling the excessively growing man-eating organism wreaking havoc on their small town community.  Gooey grotesque special effects are the true star thanks to director Chuck Russell.  Look sharply for Erika Eleniak as a victim as she's about to be felt up on a date (lucky blob!)",The Blob
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Incredibly enjoyable remake,8,16 May 2015,"Following a rash of mysterious deaths in a small Midwestern town, a local teen finds it to be done by a killer amorphous blob that grows bigger with each body dissolved into it and forces him and his friends to try to find a way to stop it before it gets out of hand. Overall this was an outrageously fun remake that really has a lot going for it and is a lot more enjoyable than expected. One of the better parts here is the ton of high quality special effects on-board, which is quite well removed from the original an serves as this one's biggest influencing factor. With a large portion of that coming mainly from the slimy creature and it's constantly changing appearance, there's some really creepy work done here to make the different incarnations of the creature, going from formless blob and distorted, mechanized mass it eventually turns into as this is quite an impressive creature. Much as that works, this one has a lot of great stuff that gives it a cheesy, enjoyable quality on the special effects front, mainly because of the increased screen-time here for the creature so not only is there more action scenes but they're also highly energetic and enjoyable. The attack on the clinic is a prime example as it just winds through the personnel with a great sense of fun and action as the race to get up from the bed in order to get out before the creature gets to the dissolving victims that generates a lot because of the gory wounds and scars. Due to the how it plays out, that continues on into the finale that really plays up a rather healthy amount of excitement due to the course of the action scenes of the creature's attacks on the different defensive groups in the sewers before the utter fun of the big shootout at the end to really get a lot out of this so there's a lot of impressive elements at work throughout the film. Overall, these are more than enough to hold off the few small flaws here. While providing the film with a lot of great action scenes, the introduction of the biohazard team in the last half doesn't really do much and seems to feel tacked on merely for an added body count since they're not mentioned before then just get dropped into the film without a lot of cleverness to the story. That lack of regard for cohesiveness is what makes their overall purpose hinder the film a tad, and it never really gives a solid explanation for the purpose behind their experimentation either as for how it got loose to begin with. Likewise, the fact that there's a few too many similarities both in terms of storyline and even wholesale sequences that come straight from the original could be a bit problematic for some with this one due to those factors. Overall, though, this one is a lot of fun and has plenty to like about it.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",The Blob

One night, he teams up with beautiful cheerleader Meg Penny(played by Shawnee Smith) when they nearly run down an old man who has something stuck on his arm which kills him in the hospital, then grows rapidly until it threatens the whole town.

23,FlashCallahan,Feeling like a one legged man.....,7,27 July 2013,"A deadly blob which is the spawn of a secret government germ warfare project, consumes everyone in its path. Teenagers try in vain to warn the townsfolk, who refuse to take them seriously.And in the final act, overacting government agents try to cover up the evidence and confine the creature....I've never seen the original, all I know is that the Cooler King is in it, and its one of a spate of monster movies made in the fifties. And while its not the best horror film out there, its a hell of a lot better than any horror remake made in the last five years.Dillon, who always takes the roles his Brother declines, is the hero in this, and of course, he's misunderstood, always being at the wrong place at the wrong time. And the guy from Robocop hates him, but it doesn't matter, because the Sheriff likes him, and the local diner owner makes him sandwiches after hours.Amanda from Saw loses her date to the titular monster, and her and Dillon hook up, to try and warn everyone about the living dessert. But as always its too late and the special effects then go into overtime.For the time, the effects are brilliant, and the make up is almost too good foe such a schlocky B-movie.The film doesn't pull any punches, and you have know idea who is going to live or dies, thanks to some risqué writing and one particular scene in the sewer.It all goes a bit bonkers when the cut price Morgan Freeman shows up with his posh voice and demands that everyone gets shot, and the ending promised a sequel, but if you like your horror movies very tongue in cheek, with a Nast streak, this is for you.",The Blob
24,Aaron1375,Gory remake.,8,14 March 2003,"This is one of those remakes that is better than the original.  This is due mainly to the fact that the people making this movie realized they didn't have to make this movie the same way as the first.  It is all right to change the story around like Carpenter did with the Thing.  What we get here is a purple blob that dissolves you in the most unpleasant way possible.  It even almost has tentacles that can grab people.  We also get to see this blob a lot more than in the original movie.  The story is somewhat the same in the first part as a meteor falls to the earth and an old man finds it and pokes it with a stick.  Like in the original this is when the blob attaches itself to his hand.  Now it starts differing from the original as a host of people gets killed off, and the blob gets bigger.  There is a movie theater scene in this one too, but it is a lot more gruesome.  Then the military shows up to handle this creature, but they seem to have some darker purpose. All in all a great movie, though I can't stand the end.",The Blob
25,Wuchakk,"Sometimes horrifying, sometimes hilarious",6,31 October 2013,"Thirty years after the original ""The Blob"" with Paul Newman we got the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (Larry Hagman also did a sequel in 1972 called ""Beware! the Blob""). The plot is like the original: A mysterious Jello-like substance from outer space lands on earth and attacks the nearest town, devouring people and growing.The movie has the vibe of a Stephen King film -- small town, cartoony characters and a monster of some sort that threatens the town -- sort of like ""Christine"", ""Silver Bullet"", ""The Tommyknockers"", ""Needful Things"" and a gazillion others. It's also reminiscent of the 80's Friday the 13th flicks. So, if you like Stephen King and the Friday the 13th films, you'll probably like this one.As the delinquent teen, Kevin Dillon (in a quasi-mullet, lol) is a surprisingly effective protagonist and Shawnee Smith is too; she plays the popular cheerleader who hesitantly seeks the delinquent's assistance. If you're not familiar with Shawnee, she went on to play the ditzy brunette Linda on ""Becker"". Anyway, it's cool seeing her as a teenager here.In some ways this remake is better than the original. It's in color, it has better F/X (naturally) and a few scenes are much more explicit and horrifying than the original. Two examples jump to mind: When the girl's boyfriend, Paul, buys the farm early on it's one of the greatest horror scenes in cinematic history, no kidding. There's another semi-shocking scene where someone we don't expect to die is hideously consumed by the creature (in the sewers). Speaking of which, one of the movie's strengths is that people you wouldn't expect to die do.But it's less effective in that it sometimes cops a semi-parody vibe, like when the cook at the diner is yanked upside down into a sink by the creature or when Erika Eleniak (in a too-brief role) buys the farm playing some kid's hot date. I couldn't help busting out laughing at these scenes and a couple of others. Were the filmmaker's intentionally shooting for camp here? Ya think?So it's a weird mix, switching from utter horror to amusing non-horror. The addition of a subplot that reveals the creature's origins as decidedly earth-centric takes away from the Blob's otherworldly and scary ambiance in the original. As such, it's not as effective as the original, at least as a serious horror film where less is more, but it IS just as entertaining and maybe more so.Interestingly, the story takes place in a California ski town (notice the snow-making vehicle), but the film was shot in Abbeville, Louisiana, which is hardly known for skiing. The long shots of the town with mountains in the background are obviously not Abbeville and are presumably of a California town.BOTTOM LINE: This is an entertaining 80's remake of ""The Blob"" that strangely bombed at the box office. It shouldn't have as it's on par with the better Stephen King and Friday the 13th flicks of that era.The film runs 95 minutes.GRADE: B",The Blob
26,The_Void,Fifties Sci-Fi meet eighties trash with great results!,8,10 November 2005,"Remakes are often frowned upon by film fans, and for good reason, but Chuck Russell's take on the silly fifties Sci-Fi flick of the same name certainly doesn't disappoint! The film has the fifties plot structure and ideas, but it's been updated to the eighties - which means gratuitous amounts of special effects, a trashy atmosphere and lots and lots of gore! This remake has sentimental value for me personally, as it's the only film in history to make me physically sick. I would have been about seven at the time, and watching this film over breakfast isn't recommended for seven-year-old kids! However, I did, of course, get the day off school. I've grown up a bit since then, but upon watching The Blob again; I've got to say that it's lost none of it's charm, only I managed to hold back on being sick this time. The plot follows an asteroid that comes down from space. Upon inspecting it, a lowly bum finds himself with a strange organism stuck to his hand! The Blob also takes advantage of the eighties teen comedy craze, and after a couple of kids find the tramp on the road, they take him to the hospital, and that's where the fun really starts The special effects are often silly, but nevertheless; very effective! The sequences are very imaginative, and take advantage of the eighties style humour that make eighties horror films what they are. The way that the blob consumes people is always disgusting, and seeing the half-melted outlines of people inside the creature is lots of fun and makes for some really good horror. Because it was made in the eighties; many of the scenes focus on raunchy kids, and this gives The Blob lots of room to manoeuvre the central monster into all kinds of hilarious situations. The acting, as you would expect, is nothing to write home about; but the cast approach their roles with gusto, and the fun performances help to make the film what it is. Chuck Russell does a great job of creating the right sort of atmosphere for the film and the screenplay is better than you would expect for a trashy eighties horror flick. Some will notice that the script was co-written by one Frank Darabont, who would, of course, go on to write and direct one of the 'best films of the nineties'. Personally, I'd rather this watch this film!",The Blob
27,trashgang,better than the original,6,26 August 2009,"As you can read on my review of the original Blob I hated that movie, the reason is online. This remake was made in the period were horrors were a not done item. The slashers era was past, and originality was beyond limits. Only franchises were made but now and then there was some hope. Hope delivered by the remake of The Blob. The storyline is the same, of course, as the original one. We have the wanderer who notice that a meteor is coming down and have his own research. We have the diner, the outlaw, the grindhouse. All in tact but better done and a better storyline. The acting is convincing knowing that Shawnee was only 18 years old. But for me it was a relieve to see that no computer was involved in the effects, they used the good old latex effects. The movie never is really creepy because it can't exist. Should it happen in space it would have been better, you know what I mean? In some ways it's bloody and sometimes it's a bit gory. But I would recommend it for the effects. It's an easy one to catch in the shops and available for a few Euro's/dollars.",The Blob
28,christopher-underwood,probably intended as something of a spoof,6,6 October 2009,"This is OK, enjoyable most of the time but doesn't quite make it as horror, comedy or sci-fi, nor as a combination of the three. Mainly because it's not scary, not funny and not serious enough for sci-fi. In fact for me the film is moving along nicely enough and is interrupted by all the man made asteroid business with the associated men in white suits. I see the screenplay is part credited to Frank Darabont who wrote the later and superior, The Mist, as well as the much acclaimed, Shawshank Redemption. The writing here seems pretty lacklustre but this was probably intended as something of a spoof and therefore intentional. Good excuse anyway. Also made in the eighties, Night of the Creeps is more fun and made only a few years ago, Slither, is much more worrying and gross.",The Blob

Well, what can you say about The Blob? First off, this is the remake of the original Blob from the 50's which was megga cheesy. I have to say that also this movie was megga cheesy, but in some ways just more fun to watch.You know I just love the fact that the cheerleader goes from this cute little girl talking all lightly and being in general you're typical cheerleader, then when she starts to fight back at the blob, she goes all Rambo screaming ""Come on! You want some of this! You son of a..."" well, you get the picture. The characters and plot is very typical, but like I said, I think this was just a cheesy good time for movies. So over all I would recommend this fun little horror movie.

Cheesy dialogue, silly special effects (but some are really good), a little different twist to the story from the original film that is laughable, some very comical moments and, of course, The Blob itself! You might find some characters you like in this movie, I did, but expect some of them to be gotten by The Blob! Surprising to see a character or two that you think might make it to the end of the film and they are bumped off early in the movie! But The Blob doesn't care about your favorite movie characters - it only cares about consuming them! This is definitely a ""popcorn flick"" - one you simply just kick back and enjoy the fun going on the screen. It's not much of a thought provoking film as it is pure crazy fun! 7/10",The Blob

32,thesar-2,Zombie...don't screw this up!,8,8 June 2010,"Surprise, surprise. I gave 1988's remake of the classic B-Movie/Steve McQueen The Blob eight out of 10 stars. Why? It didn't lie to me. And that's one of the qualities I love most about movies – truth.Don't lie to me. Don't make this remake of a B-Movie into a serious drama of goo-attacks. I've heard that Rob Zombie – who had a good track record until Halloween II (2009), is remaking it and I'm sure he'll make it more serious. Make that, the only serious ""Blob"" movie from the three that I know of: The Original, Son of Blob and this remake. Laughing out loud, he said in a quote – at least this is what I read and I'm paraphrasing, that he is going to remake/reimagine The Blob without, well, ""the Blob."" He stated he doesn't think audiences would be scared anymore of a goo, or ""Blob,"" that attacks people. Isn't that like remaking Jaws without the shark, inland and about a boy and his dog?Point is, sure, someone else could come in and make a ""serious"" horror flick. And I would still go see it. But, for this 1988 remake, I was very pleased with the results of making a ""modern"" (for 1988 and 1980s audiences) absolute-B-Movie. It had everything: bad acting, bad dialogue, big-bad government, bad boy (Dillon) with a bad cycle, pretty prom girl, inept cops, parked & horny kids ready for slaughter, tons of gore, suspense, Stephen King-like Minister who knows the end is NEAR!, small town, tongue-in-cheek horror movie references, crowds (well, extras) scrambling from a giant beast of sorts, a strange love story, a twist finale and a growing and indestructible monster with a weakness, if that makes any sense. For this type of movie, who seriously could ask for more?Let's set the scene: Small Town, USA. High School Football unites community. Players wooing the pretty cheerleaders. Kids want into the latest horror ""slice and dice."" Bad Seed returns on a motorcycle. Bum in the woods collects cans for money andsuddenly a strange meteorite lands and some ""goo"" attaches itself to the vagrant's hand with some painful results.Let the gore, barely featured in the movie's predecessors, begin! He attempts to chop off his arm with an axe to no avail; the BLOB simply leap-frogs over the new and obviously painful giant paper cut and continues its digestion of the man's arm.Really, from this moment on is Point A to B to C for anyone who's anyone who's seen a classic B movie. Enter the bad boy who shows some heart, the cheerleader who wants to save the world and the adults who wouldn't believe them if they wrote their experiences in blood. They try to make people believe in the Blob, all the while trying to survive until the inevitable explosive and obvious climax, with the equally predictable twist (""leave it open to a sequel!"" says the producer) finale.It's a small wonder this movie basically made NOTHING at the box office. Perhaps people were expecting what Zombie would direct later. I really don't know why anyone at the time (1988) would have such a problem; this movie is quintessential 1980s horror and definitely a late 80's homage to scary movies of the decade past. It even had some true suspenseful moments and a great ending you would expect from a movie of such caliber.Okay, okay, I grew up on the Blob and it did scare me. For, if it happens to touch you – you're GONE. (As previously mentioned, they prove that theory of mine by the failed attempts to chop off the arm to separate the body from the section being devoured by the Blob.) That said, I wasn't impressed (or liked) the additions/alterations to the Blob, such as the ""arms,"" the ""groans"" or the color pink. I think this is the direction Zombie wants to take it: more alien, less goo. Uh, it's a BLOB, for the love of Pete. It's supposed to be Jell-O from Hell-O.Also, most of the special effects worked, but the ones that didn'twell, they REALLY didn't. Sure, it's labeled as a B-Movie, but cartoons don't belong in an all-live action flick.Only recommended to those who read this review and said, ""Oh, yeah, I loved those times!"" Like me, you'll enjoy this throwback to the good ole pre-CGI days.Side Note: I saw the opening credits and I bypassed Kevin Dillon's name immediately since I already knew who he was and that he was the new anti-hero of the picture. But then, I recognized the name ""Shawnee Smith"" and knew I knew that name. Even watching the entire movie, I still didn't recognize her. Thank you, IMDbaw; she was a Saw III (or part 1 onward) favorite of mine. Man – she does NOT look like she aged much during the decade or so jump from this movie and her first Saw appearance.",The Blob

Above-average of its type, thanks to fun characters, terrific special effects and Chuck Russell's good directing (he had already displayed his talent with ""Nightmare On Elm Street 3"", the best film of that series). It deserves a **1/2 rating.

More fun, more excitement and a nice touch of humour (with its witty writing). Still evident is the spirit of these old-fashion monster films from those early decades (50s and 60s), but it's obviously updated with a considerably unpleasant edge and the icky, elastic special effects look tremendous. It's a refreshing b-movie at heart with a big A-grade budget. Director Chuck Russell dresses up the thrills and humour of the smart material in a pleasing package, as the story does offer some imaginative touches, cheese and puts a spin on certain plot conventions of the original (like the origin of the meteor that was carrying the blob). What it achieves is an unpredictable blend --- knowing when to throw up fearful suspense, grisly shocks and the timing to have a laugh at itself. The performances a very good with the likes of Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith in the leads and well-rounded support characters. An impressively amusing homage.",The Blob

The Blob is a film that you don't really mean to watch, you just find yourself doing so when you come in from the pub at nearly midnight and accidentally switch the TV on. Then you find you're already half way through and, despite not knowing everything about it, sit there glued to the end.I'm one of the few horror lovers who hasn't actually seen the original, so I can't compare it to that. However, I know a decent B-movie when I see one (if that isn't a contradiction in terms). The Blob, well, it's about a blob of pink goo that eats/absorbs people. Nuff said. If you like the sound of that, you'll probably love the film.Yes, the acting is hardly Oscar-worthy and people do some pretty daft things at times. But there are enough shocks, surprises and generally genre-breaking things to keep you laughing into your popcorn until the end of the movie. It's not over long and the effects/gore aren't bad for a B-movie in the eighties.If you can ignore the unfashionable hair and poor man's Morgan Freeman (if you've seen Stephen King's 'Dreamcatcher' you'll probably understand that reference) then you should love this.They don't make 'em like they used to (some may say that's a good thing, but not me!).",The Blob

'The Blob' is a different kind of slasher film, but nevertheless essentially still a slasher movie.It's so good to watch a horror movie with practical effects, excellent make-up and incredible puppetry. Although the blob itself is not that good in terms of visuals, the killing scenes - especially - are visually amazing. With regards to the killings, I must admit it was unpredictable, and relentless. There's also very good character development.As the film progresses, it becomes more intense and action-packed. There are a number of conveniences that could easily have been avoided or fixed, but this is nevertheless a very good watch. Shawnee Smith is a likable hero while Kevin Dillon's character Brian, becomes an unlikely hero. Well done!a",The Blob
38,sol-,Blob Origins,7,25 December 2016,"Made on a bigger budget with better special effects, this 'Blob' remake from 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors' director Chuck Russell and 'The Mist' screenwriter Frank Darabont is a far creepier experience than the original ever was. Memorable, unsettling moments include an arm being ripped off a teenager that the blob is consuming and the shock reveal of a literally half-eaten corpse on a hospital bed. What truly distinguishes the 1988 version from the 1958 take though are the scattered intelligent attempts to explain the presence of the blob and how it landed in the town. At one point, it is likened to a 'plague', possibly part of the asteroid that is said to have wiped out the dinosaurs; at another point, it is speculated that it is military biological warfare with Cold War tensions hinted at. The remake does little to improve on the characters and the performances though. The notion of a town imbued with cynical adults unwilling to believe any teenagers or kids is sadly missing here and the most likable teen character is killed off very early on. Never to mind, the film is entertaining until the end with lots of well-placed humour (condon-buying shenanigans; horror movie cinema audience reaction shots edited against various blob attacks; a cutaway to red jelly being slurped) and while all the carnage during the final few scenes grows a little recycled and tiresome, the sheer terror of the blob is felt throughout.

THE BLOB II was just as much fun as the original, in my opinion, and the reason is obvious: Chuck Russell was the director. Russell directed the only one of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies that I genuinely liked (THE DREAM WARRIORS), so I was looking forward to seeing THE BLOB. It didn't disappoint. The story's a kinda sorta tribute throwback to the 50s REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE scenario(s), and it works with Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith as the leads.

As a fan of McQueen, i consider the original as a classic monster film of the 50s, this one i consider as a creature film of the 80s.It is more violent than the original with lots of body counts including that of a small kid.
It has humor n action too.
While the original is a simple one, this one functions as a biological weapon gone haywired as well as an authoritarian one where the military doesn't care about the citizens.
We have Matt Dillon with mullet n leather jacket n a very young Shawnee Smith.The sheriff's death scene was ahead of its time n later imitated many times in horror movies.
Dr Meddows' death sequence, i believe, inspired the one in Deep Blue Sea involving Morgan Freeman.
Watch out for Bill Moseley in a tiny role of that of a soldier (watch closely the sewer scene).",The Blob
42,videorama-759-859391,89's first welcoming horror surprise,8,13 October 2014,"I must admit I never saw the original, but I love this remake just the same. It has enough scares, goo and gore to warrant a great night at the movies. I think the whole thing here was well done. It wasn't a badly made film. The casting was spot on. Everyone delivers, especially our rebellious hero Flag (Dillon). He rocked here, and by far stole the movie, though we can't forget his fantastic and psychotic soldier in Platoon. Some alien life form in a big jello ball which can take many shapes is killing the occupants of a small town. The town's cheer leading beauty (Smith) teams up with our rebel, where you'll almost hope there's a romantic spark between him as this killer blob of jello, has just consumed her boyfriend. I'm willing to bet that this is obviously more gruesome than the original, but just watching the blob itself, is fun in just seeing what it can do. It's also fun, watching Dillon come off his bike. Real tasty horror, to get your teeth into. You won't be disappointed.",The Blob

I actually prefer the remake (one of the few times you'll hear me say that) because it covered ground that the original failed to cover and the Blob looked meaner and nastier than the original pile of goo. Kevin Dillion stars as the reluctant hero. The story to the remake is very much the same (except for the expected eighties additions and themes). No hokey pokey stuff here folks. If you like the original then you probably wont enjoy this update. More horror than science fiction and the gore level is real high.I hope they don't try and remake this movie again.

Kevin Dillion was enjoyable as the rapscallion who does good and Shawnee Smith is in hot mode, Bill Mosley, Donavan Leitch, Art La Fleur and Candy Clark co-star as well.Recommended.",The Blob
45,jadavix,Entertaining schlock-fests with effects that still hold up,7,20 January 2018,"The blob is a viscid, amorphous creature, which looks like a huge jellyfish. It comes to Earth in the shell of a fallen meteorite, where it immediately dispatches the vagrant who discovers it, and then works through the usual hierarchy of horror movie casualties: sex mad teens, cynical working stiffs, and finally, shady government bureaucrats.The film is a remake of the '58 Steve McQueen vehicle, but, as I'm sure I don't have to tell you, this version's Kevin Dillon is no Steve McQueen. His mullet does steal the show, but he's an obnoxious screen presence; perhaps all too convincing as a moronic delinquent teenager.This remake also came after Watergate, meaning that the government types are maybe the real bad guys; at least, they would be in a better movie, which would have developed these guys to people you hate. Here, they're just callous a-holes.There's also a particularly creepy, unpleasant child actor, who I feel I must have seen in other '80s flicks; or perhaps there were just a bunch of child actors around in the '80s who looked and acted that way, or a lot of roles that required them.The movie also has a cameo from Jack Nance, but this is not a movie you watch for the actors. It's a creature feature, and after all this time, the effects are still really impressive, making ""The Blob"" a great schlock fest, even if its story and characters aren't up to much.",The Blob

The movie tells a story, has an important theme, is well-acted and well-scripted and is well-filmed. The movie is more than just a scare flick. It poses an ethical dilemma: the good of the few versus the good of the many. Is there a time when people are expendable? When Hollywood deals with such an serious themes, the result is usually poor. But in this case, the movie succeeds. As for the blob itself, it's a product of questionable research done without proper controls. That is, it's about science gone wild, and the consequences therefrom. Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon perform wonderfully as the lead characters. Smith definitely should have received recognition for the high quality of her performance. Jeffrey DeMunn and Joe Seneca also give notable performances. Candy Clark looked hot in her waitress uniform and the rest of the cast performed wonderfully. After watching this movie, one will be more careful with gooey things that move.",The Blob

49,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""The biggest son of a bitch you've ever seen!""",10,16 January 2016,"Now here's one rather unsung 80's classic that's quite dear to my heart, I had an absolute blast watching it many times as a kid, it was such a scary thrill ride, and I still feel pretty much the same these days. I think it's miles from being something that could be considered campy or a B-movie it's very slickly directed, I love this movie. It's such a solid little entertainer, I always find it so easy to get into. I like the spooky intro sequence that shows what appears to be a ghost town, foreshadowing how it nearly does end up, until you find out that everyone's at a football game. I love the small town atmosphere, I think that comes across really well. It has something of the feel of a 50's sci-fi film with more modern sensibilities and humour. And the 80's twist on the nature of the Blob is cool and really works, making it a government experiment in germ warfare gone out of control instead of an alien. For me it's the only version of the Blob worth a damn and I find it genuinely scary. The excellent tag-line ""Terror has no shape"" does have meaning to it, there is something extra nightmarish about a faceless gelatinous force that can get anywhere, sneak up on you, and that indiscriminately and ravenously swallows up any unfortunates it comes across and melts them down like acid to component matter that becomes more of its mass. It gets redder and redder throughout the movie as it grows larger and more powerful until it has all the townfolk trapped. The fantastic practical special effects are probably the real standout showpiece of this picture. It has a high kill rate, and the often surprising and brutal death scenes are stunning. It's a very ruthless horror movie, characters who you don't expect to, die horribly. Like the handsome guy who seems like he's going to be the hero until the Blob gets the drop on him in a creepy hospital, or a friendly waitress who's crushing death inside a phone box is a scene of abject terror, a good sheriff who's death is offscreen, and an honest-to-god kid! It even spits him back out for a second so you can admire the half-melted handiwork! The other ones that I can't resist mentioning is the scene that takes the sex equals death rule to the next level as well as to me feeling like a bit of a homage to John Carpenter's The Thing as the Blob explodes out of the sleeping girl as the guy feels her up, the cook who's forced down a tiny drain hole head-first, and also the poor goofy-looking f**k with the yoyo who ends up a wailing freakish horror stuck to the ceiling and the whole awesome theatre attack sequence that soon follows. Perhaps the Blob whipped up that loudmouth guy because it was just trying to watch the movie? These are the kind of special effects sequences that are very memorable, and I love that! They take a lot of everyday places and things and effectively make them disturbing. I love Shawnee Smith in this, who doesn't? She's so cool and natural as the cheerleader who loses her jock, saves the no-good local punk and the whole town! The chemistry between her and Kevin Dillon was terrific and you genuinely bought them as unlikely heroes. This movie is fantastic, it embodies a great deal of what I personally find endearing about 80's monster horror. It proves that you don't need a massive budget to make effective sci-fi horror. You just need a solid script, a cast with good chemistry, some ingenuity, and you can take a little and make it into a lot. Thank you kindly Blob, you engulfed and absorbed me with your charm!",The Blob

Kevin Dillon and a couple of other young actors take over as the leads who discover the original blob attaching itself to an old man. The Dillon character is a recluse who the authorities find hard to believe on anything, so he attaches with a cheerleader in the trek to convince the town of the alien goo-like presence in the city. The blob is much more disgusting and alien-like than the original and gets very big, very quickly. It travels thru the underground sewer systems of the small town, and attacks from below thru sinks etc... It also keeps remnants of those it's devoured making for kind of a chunky-like goo glob(sorry, for the specific grossness displayed here). Anyway, a subplot is added that includes the government covering up info about the whereabouts of the meteorite, which is inept at best. At this point in the movie, I was ready for it to be over. This silly subplot makes the movie worse than the original. Why they decided to do this, I don't know...but it was definitely a bad decision!!

54,ferbs54,"""Blob"" vs. ""Blob""",7,9 November 2007,"So just what does the 1988 remake of the classic 1958 film ""The Blob"" have that the original does not? Well, I can tell you that it does NOT have a classic Burt Bacharach theme song, or a leading man on the order of Steve McQueen, or the originality of the earlier film, or that film's sweet charm. But what it DOES bring to the table are some spectacular gross-out moments, and a Blob monster that is more than just a glop of slow-moving, cherry-colored gelatin. Indeed, this 1980s Blob is a fast-moving, pseudopod-laden, acid-dissolving killing machine that comes off far nastier than the original; to be succinct, better Blob FX in the remake, as would be expected. So while the 1958 film can brag about its endearing likeableness, the newer model's main boast would be its technology. And while our favorite magenta hunk of goo is explained as merely an unfriendly drop-in from space in the first film, here, it is the result of science gone awry and a government cover-up; not as much fun, for me. The spunky teens who first encounter the menace here (Kevin Dillon, Shawnee Smith and Donovan Leitch) are all fine, though, and, to make things interesting, many characters whom we expect to stick around are Blobarized in the film's first half, increasing the unpredictability factor. This remodel also features some exciting set pieces: that movie theatre sequence, a sewer chase, and the classic kitchen sink/plunger scene. And it also gives us the most harrowing telephone booth siege since Tippi Hedren cowered in ""The Birds"" ('63). The film's fictitious town of Arborville, by the way, was filmed in Abbeville, in south coastal Louisiana; let's just hope that this town survived Katrina better than Arborville did the Blob!",The Blob
55,TOMNEL,"Remembered mainly for it's special effects, and man, are they cool!",7,27 January 2009,"The 1980's was the ultimate time to remake old horror movies. The special effects were good enough where the creatures created in previous years could look as amazing as they could, but it was also before computers were big, so the effects were not computer generated. The title character of the Blob here is a technical marvel and great to look at. The story and characters are fairly throw away, but everything adds up to make a decent horror remake.A meteor comes to Earth and out of it comes a liquid substance that eats anything and everything in it's path. A town of people have to avoid being eaten by avoiding this menacing creature. Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith) and outcast Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon) are the main teenagers who try to survive the wrath of this growing pink menace.The main positive of this movie is it's special effects. The Blob itself is really amazing looking, and when it kills people, that too looks great. These are special effects that still hold strong by today's standards. The acting is alright, as is everything else. Other than the blob, this is nothing but a typical teenager movie, mixed with a slasher. There is a mismatched bonding story between the school cheerleader and the bad boy loaner. Then there's the climax of the movie which consists of kids running from the blob as it kills everyone in it's path. The kills are usually unique and cool to look at, but it's just nothing special in the plot of character department.This is a fun remake for it's technical aspects. Other than that, this is no more than a goofy and clichéd good time. Remakes like ""The Fly"" and ""The Thing"" are far superior to this one, but this still stands out as an entertaining piece of '80s horror cinema.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. R for strong violence.",The Blob
56,aidanratesmovies,Fun as h*** and that's all that really matters,9,17 June 2021,"An incredibly fun and entertaining horror flick- The Blob improves upon the flaws of the original to make for an even more timely film. Most of my flaws with the film are rather little and/or simple. The plot can be a bit predictable at times, and as per usual, a few things don't age quite well- but most of its in good fun (or at least is eventually). Besides that though, I truly did enjoy the film for what it was- a highly engaging and special effects loaded horror flick with plenty of scares. I found it impressive how intense the film still is after so many years, which isn't an easy task, let alone its special effects holding up quite well for 1988 and it being always very cool to watch. All the actors did a pretty good job, some can be a bit campy at times, but it truly does add to the fun of the movie. By far, Kevin Dillon is the standout of the film, with his rebellious motorcycle riding attitude- it just serves as the perfect lead for an 80's film- and a very unique point of view for a horror flick to take. The pacing throughout the film is perfect, and the music is quite well done. It has its weaker moments, but in the end, I truly enjoyed The Blob for what it was, a remake that actually improves upon its predecessor- and was all together quite thrilling and fun to watch.My Rating: 9/10.",The Blob

58,Movie-ManDan,"Better In Some Respects, But Also Inferior.",5,31 March 2021,"How on earth can you make a movie about a giant piece of jello that swallows people that people can take seriously? Simple, you can't. A shapeless slime from outer space is beyond cheesy and in 1958, that theory was proven. Luckily, top-notch acting and characters made up for the silly monster. Thirty years later with massive upgrades in technology, it seemed like the perfect time to remake the Steve McQueen classic into something actually scary. 95% or the effects are really good (the remaining five percent are from typical computer effects in the decade), but all the cool effects don't seem to really matter.Steve McQueen was the perfect lead in the original. In this remake, Kevin Dillon plays a leather-wearing loner who we cannot care about. The lead girl is played by Shawnee Smith, who is also not worth it. They try to warn and save the people in their small town, but we do not care as much as we should. This is because the characters are boring and unoriginal.Now let's talk about the actual blob. In the original, it looked like a giant piece of jello. This new one looks more like a burning translucent thingy. But when it kills and consumes people, look out! As mentioned, the majority of the effects are practical and VERY well done. Whether it eats someone or melts them, they are impressive and pretty scary. The CGI may be dated, but we come to forgive it.Horror can't be just blood and kills, there has to be a good hero and a good villain. Otherwise, the kills mean nothing and the movie just becomes a dumb freakshow. ""The Blob"" from 1958 succeeded in making characters to root for, while ""The Blob"" from 1988 tried but was unable to make compelling characters. If you happen to like them, that's great.The whole idea of slime that grows and eats people may never seem actually scary. Studios can only do their best. This one has better effects but worse characters. The old one has better characters, but inferior effects. I wish we get another ""Blob"" remake that's the best of both worlds.I liked the first ""Blob"" in a weird way because I was so invested in the characters and the slime itself was a hoot. The remake? I didn't like the characters but I loved the effects. So this is split.2/4.",The Blob
59,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,So much better than the past two,8,27 May 2012,"In 1958 and in 1972, audiences were able to see the most vile of all alien life forms come onto the screen; the blob. But the word ""vile"" would not be in the interest to use for these films. The blob in both previous films were slow moving and were barely on screen and when they were, it wasn't for long. Thirty years after the first ""blob"" movie, director Chuck Russell, The Mask (1994), takes charge of this franchise and decides to rejuvenate this creature once more. And although, it had a mild reception from critics, it is arguably the best movie of The Blob.The film actually starts out relatively the same as the first in 1958. However, there are several parts to this film's story that are quite different from all the others. For example, in the 1958 version, Steve McQueen starred as the so-called ""hero"", a good-natured kid who was only trying to warn the residents of a flesh eating Jell-O mold. The viewer may be surprised however to find out, that the hero is not who they'd expect it to be.Kevin Dillon plays Brian Flagg, a punk whom nobody likes just because he's a little bit misunderstood. Co-starring with Dillon is Shawnee Smith who plays Meg Penny, a good schoolgirl whom which both encounter The Blob. Another thing that is different from the other films is that this movie doesn't have the main characters trying to find the authorities and convince them of what happened. It seems that the authorities find them more than half the time. Interestingly enough, Russell's direction put quite a twist on the beginning story line. It may not be original, but it definitely good to see something out of the ordinary.There were only a couple elements in this remake that did not really work here. The music was composed and conducted by Michael Hoenig. His music did have a lot of dark tones in it, but it failed to leave a memorable chord and it wasn't scary enough either. The other element that needed work was the dialog. Not all of it was bad, Dillon had some funny exchanges between characters with his wisecracks. But the issue was that much of it was predictable. The viewer will be able to tell what will happen next even before it happens. It's actually disappointing for a remake that was done this well.However, the good outweighs the bad by far. The Blob is so much more appealing to see for its grotesque and vulgar look. The Blob is no longer that solid maroon color from the past two films. To describe it in the most simplistic way, it looks like a mass of human brains that were mashed together as a whole. It really is a mess (in a good way) and that's not all. This particular Blob not only has looks, but is also quick on its feet! The special effects in this film are stunning. Of course it looks dated now but compared to the others, it is by far the best looking.Another great aspect is how much more graphic this film is. The other two for its time, I guess, you could call rated ""R"" but this version, is by all accounts rated ""R"" for a reason. The killing scenes in this movie are just all out gruesome. It's not a blood fest but it can be nasty at times. The last thing to mention about this creature is how closely it followed the traits of The Thing (1982). It seems like anything that resembles these two organisms share the same weaknesses and yet they are very different from each other.Chuck Russell's version of the 1958 ""blob"" not only pays homage to its predecessors but it redefines what The Blob should be like as a terrifying, flesh-eating, gelatinous life form. The only things holding it back are it's somewhat undeveloped dialog and not a dark enough musical soundtrack.",The Blob
60,p-stepien,Shoddy remake of a shoddy original,5,29 October 2012,"Let's recap (and copy paste from the review of the original): When a meteorite falls from the sky, a local hobo comes out to investigate, unwisely trying to closely observe a glutinous substance dripping from within the rock's exterior. The substance soon covers the old man's hand and quickly starts eating away at his flesh. A teenage couple Paul Taylor (Donovan Leitch) and Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith) together with the local rebellious juvenile Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon) happen upon the poor man and decide to transport him to the local hospital. Soon however the blubbering mass devours his first prey and readies itself to consume every human being in town! Thankfully however the government comes to aide the situation...Storywise ""The Blob"" setups extremely nicely, expanding vastly on the rudimentary plot of the original and its unconvincing demeanour. The main improvement stems from a long introduction to certain town individuals (the sheriff, the local diner and its waitress, the town youth and so on), causing the horror to affect affable individuals, not human facades. When people start dying, often irrespective of typical horror logic, viewers truly care and gasp with sorrow. That is until the circus comes to town in the form of government officials and divert attention from the jelly monster to an incredulous plot fronted by hammy, cheesy and downright campy solutions (rife with the worst stereotypes of mad scientists and crazy priests).Many scenes are directly taken from the original (hiding in the freezer, the cinema attack), but with much more fright factor owing largely to vastly improved budget and special effects capabilities. Nonetheless as the monster grows the fear dissipates - the blob becoming to big to truly terrify, as our horrors best lurk in the dark.

 In basic terms, the story is pretty much the same as in the 1958 version. However, there are a few differences throughout.
 Kevin Dillon is ok as the rebellious hero of the hour but he doesn't personify coolness like Steve McQueen did by a long way.

63,PredragReviews,"""Don't eat with your face!""",8,19 May 2016,"A very good remake that is just begging for a religious apocalyptic sequel as we see at the end. Both special effects and the cast are very good in a story tweaked for its time of the Cold War 1980's. Just compare it to the original from 1957. Nice action and character development too. There is a great surprise in character leadership throughout. It was also nice seeing Candy Clark too. Shawnee Smith was wonderful also.The plot actually works in this 1988 quasi-gorefest. It is basically an almost-exact remake of the 1958 film with some minor nuances added like the government's complicity in harboring this ""biological weapon"" and the hero being actually a couple with more of an emphasis on her than him. Basically the other differences were in the precise roles of the various co-stars and featured players, plus the tendency in this remake to kill off more audience-friendly characters, including children. There is also much faster-paced action throughout, as this blob really goes after its meals like each one is its last. The movie really explores the full potential of a giant blob that dissolves and absorbs anything it comes across, and you have to appreciate a story that leaves no stone un-turned.

65,screenman,blobbier than before,6,25 July 2009,"Here's a remake of the old original - I'm tempted to say classic - format of the nameless horror-shock monster that was the staple of teen drive-in fests.The original starred a very youthful Steve McQueen before he got too big for his Stalag. This effort has nobody of particular note - not then or later. The whole bunch scream and run or are devoured by turns, whilst coping with a script which is about on par with their acting.In this movie, perhaps by default, the real star of the show is the blob itself. Gone is the old giant creeping Christmas pudding; this beastie is fast and furious, with an appetite to match. Some of the effects are really quite excellent and I am tempted to compare them to those of Carpenter's 'The Thing'. It's yet another life-form from outer space. A recklessly nosey wino pokes it with a stick and he's suddenly in serious trouble. By degrees it gets bigger, bolder and ever more ravenous. The scale of slaughter becomes both tremendous and indiscriminate. Don't suppose being a kid will save you.Far more engaging than the sluggish original, this was a remake at the right time. Special effects had come on in leaps and bounds during the intervening decades, but (also like 'The Thing')it still predated the rather drab modern dependence upon CGI. Definitely worth a watch if you get the chance. If someone had taken the trouble to write an intelligent script and put a decent ensemble together, this would now be hailed as a horror classic. Instead, it reflects its teen-horror drive-in roots, which is perhaps what the makers only intended.",The Blob
66,arungeorge13,One of the better body-horror flicks of the '80s! [+61%],6,12 May 2020,"The Blob is, as expected, an enjoyably campy 80s body-horror flick. The practical effects used in the film stand good to this day, while the CGI looks dated (when viewed in 2020). Director Chuck Russell delivers the goods better when he focuses on Arborville's civilian storylines than the government conspiracy subplot. Frank Darabont, in one of his earlier co-writing ventures, writes Flagg (a cocky Kevin Dillon) as one of those pretentious 'bad boys' of the times, but with a heart. Shawnee Smith does the screaming (and at times, rescuing) honors neatly. Who knew a then 19-year-old Shawnee would end up becoming Amanda in the Saw series years later?A movie such as The Blob is bound to be remembered for its gooey antagonist creature, brought to life using special effects. Tony Gardner's team has done a remarkable job, to say the least. It obviously draws inspiration from other skilfully made body-horror films such as (John Carpenter's) The Thing, (David Cronenberg's) The Fly, and (Philp Kaufman's) Invasion of the Body Snatchers. However, all the set-pieces involving practical effects remain wholly memorable. These include a restaurant worker being pulled into a plughole face first, the drowning of a telephone booth containing Candy Clark's character, and a teenager's face getting melted.. all by the slimy entity.",The Blob
67,rivertam26,Awesome,9,19 March 2020,"This is not just one of the best remakes of all time it's one of the best movies of all time. The Blob remake is that rare retro film that is an absolute perfect example of it's time. The basis is the same as an alien organism attacks a small town and grows with each new victim while a bad ass cheerleader played by Shawnee Smith (Saw) and the towns bad boy tries to stop it. The movie has the most amazing practical effects and it's so entertaining. The movie theater scene is one of the best things ever put on film. Sure there's not a tremendous amount of character development or layers but what it aims to do it does and amazingly so. It's edge of your seat, intense and the pacing and confident direction from Chuck Russell (Nightmare on elm street 3) are inspired.

69,oneguyrambling,Cheesy tongue in cheek 80s horror fun with insane SFX.,7,8 April 2011,"Here is the classic example of a film taking the most basic of formula but doing it so well that it creates a minor classic. Aside from a catchy alluring title The Blob is merely a device that justifies some quality old school gore SFX while the yet to be devoured spit pithy quips around.In this ""all the way 80s"" horror film replete with mullets Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (just how old are they both?) shout and scream when the situation demands – and run from miniature effects when necessary once a mysterious creature falls from the sky in immortal horror movie fashion.Kevin is the young (mulletted) rebel, Shawnee the high school cheerleader who should never EVER fall for the young rebel – should she? Brian (Kev) spends each day smokin', ridin' and not carin' Meg (Shaw-nee) spends her time cheerin', rosy-cheekin' and aspirin' The threat is a small gelatinous blob (thanks Wayne's World and GTA 3!) that ingests all living tissue that it encounters, absorbing them into an ever-growing – but still blob-ish hungry organism intent on eating new friends and ingesting people.Of course in a small town, especially one featured in a horror movie, it's not a good idea to be horny or a teen – definitely not a horny-teen: of the 6 characters trying to get some on this fateful night 5 end up a little more liquid-e than they perhaps intended.Highlights include a scene in the movie theatre where the lobby comes to the film for some snacks and the subsequent chase into the water system.The gore effects are simply excellent and prove once and for all that CGI can amplify and intensify – but should never be used as a crutch – yes The Wolfman I'm looking straight at you again.The Blob in itself when seen is hardly menacing or scary, but the mere suggestion of being slug-food is revolting, especially when backed up by scenes showing just that where characters are absorbed and basically melted. The Blob takes this suggestion and turns it up to 11, it is an often overlooked 80s film that deserves more attention and admiration.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Definitely hedging more on the ""comedy"" side of horror-comedy, The Blob nonetheless deserves more prominence in the genre's discussion. It is funny, smart and inoffensively disgusting.",The Blob

Flagg left the hospital and meg found him and talked at the diner. The man working in the kitchen was sucked into the blocked kitchen sink and the woman that was going to date the sheriff was eaten at the telephone booth and the sheriff was already inside dissolving into the blob. The two survived by hiding in the refrigerator because it was avoiding cold. They were put into a van by the government scientist. Flagg escaped and meg went after his brother who secretly was watching a horror movie at the cinema theater with his friend. The best killing was the Paul's friend and his date at his car. He had a mini bar at his trunk and his sleeping date turned into a blob. Meg and the two boys escaped the theater where the annoying spoiler machine guy was eaten by the blob. They took refuge down in the sewage canals. There were rats being eaten by the blob. Meg's brother managed to get out but meg couldn't get through and the scientist were after her. They were eaten too and meg dove back into the water where his brothers friend was eaten. Flagg was there by a miraculous coincidence of the 80s and took meg out of the hole into the large cylinder. They avoided the blob with his chopper. They wanted to get out of the sewage system but the scientist didn't let them. He wanted them to be locked up tight down there with an injured scientist. Flagg blew up the hole with the weapon that the scientist had and they got out to convince people of the dubious things their government has been up to. The bald deputy was there and the scientist in charge was eaten and then they all decided to fight it instead of catching it alive. Flagg brought the snow truck and meg blew it up and the blob turned into pink crystal pieces. But the priest who got disfigured by burning on that night took some frozen crystals at the diner and he was up to start another apocalypse when his god tells him the time. Seeing Jigsaw's Amanda as a teenager in a Cronenberg-esque creature feature movie was really lovely,The Blob
71,IonicBreezeMachine,A remake that finds its own voice while respecting the legacy of the original,7,15 October 2021,"In the small California town of Arborville, a meteorite crashes to earth which contains a living gelatinous substance. When a homeless man's hand is absorbed by the substance, three teens outsider/delinquent Brian Flagg(Kevin Dillon),cheerleader Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith), and star football player Paul Taylor (Donovan Leitch) come across the old man and take him to the hospital. Eventually the growth on the man's hand consumes the rest of the old man and becomes a massive blob intent on eating anything and everything it can.Released in 1988, The Blob is a remake of the independently produced 1958 sci-fi film of the same name that served as Steve McQueen's screen debut and helped usher in a flood of independently produced sci-fi creature films aimed at the teen drive-in market (many of which would be given second life on MST3K). A staple of TV airings and even a tongue-in-cheek sequel Beware! The Blob in 1972, the original The Blob was a knowingly camp affair that never took itself that seriously down to the title theme song that became a novelty hit. A reteam of screenwriter Frank Darabont director Chuck Russell who'd previously given audiences the highest grossing Nightmare on Elm Street movie Dream Warriors (also the best reviewed until New Nightmare), the movie featured special effects by Tony Gardner and a darker more cynical edge than the original 1958 film (even reflected in the origin of The Blob itself) and helped to give the 1988 The Blob a unique identity and stand on its own as a unique experience.Much like the original The Blob, the movie is primarily told from the point of view of the Teenagers in this small town albeit updated for a contemporary setting. The character's have a very ""Brat Pack"" inspired approach as opposed to the relatively squeaky clean image of the '58 version with the post WWII optimism replaced with economic and political uncertainty in Reagan era America with Arborville struggling economically due to unreliability of the Ski season to bring in the tourists it once did. No where is that cynicism more present than in Kevin Dillon's Brian Flagg, labeled a ""delinquent"" by the police and community and a societal outsider who can only aspire to leave a town that doesn't want him. Shawnee Smith is quite good as someone who seems like your typical ""Homecoming Queen"" type, but in the second half shows resilience, ingenuity, and drive to survive with some really strong moments character wise. And the Blob itself is a technical marvel, brought to life with some really well done effects, the filmmakers take advantage of the fact the blob doesn't have to be set in one shape (like the '58 original which was mostly rotund) and do some really creative things with the blob in having it charge through doors, stretch out tendrils, or dissolving carcasses.The Blob is the best kind of remake, faithful to the original while adding its own spin. The movie does a nice job of taking the original plot of the '58 film and adding its own additions while still retaining the core appeal that made The Blob work. You can watch the '58 Blob and the '88 Blob and get two unique but memorable experiences.",The Blob
72,Mister-6,Killer Jello for the '80s!,7,18 August 1999,"Gotta give 'em credit: the original was good, but the 1988 remake of ""The Blob"" makes good with the scares.Credit the FX team more than the writers or directors for the scary parts. This updated Blob moves like lightning in terms of action as well as physical motion.  In the '50's the thing just crawled around eating - but this year's Blob pulls you down the sink, traps you in a phone booth, breaks you in two, crawls up into your pressurized suit, just slaps right down on you and makes you disappear in a cloud of dust!  This Blob is downright mean!The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from the '80s, but who watches movies like this for the calibre of acting?

This is the lesser of the three movies, but the other two are fantastic, while this is just plain good. The plot is well told with enough time on the main characters, but not too much to ruin the pacing, and the effects are really well done throughout with great gore and creature based attacks.

74,ivo-cobra8,A horror action classic remake of the 80's - I love this flick!,10,2 May 2016,"The Blob (1988) is an 80's action horror classic remake from Steve McQueen version 1958 film. I love this film to death. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I was 10 years old and a kid when I saw the first time this film and I absolutely loved it. I saw some owner of the video store that was selling movies on VHS one of those films was this film from the 80's The Blob, I wish I could get this film on VHS before it was soled out, but my parents didn't give me the money, than the film disappeared of the air and I have never saw it or watch it. It was never on TV it took me 20 years to watch this movie, recently I found some guys who love this film and I order it on Blu-ray disc and I got it. I absolutely love movie's from the 80's and I love this flick to death it Is my favorite monster movie. I am, putting this flick right between Aliens and Deep Rising right between them as a monster movies. This is my second favorite Chuck Russell film the first one will be A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) that I absolutely love to death, this is the second film I love to death. I definitely appreciate what the original did but, yeah, the '88 Blob is certainly a feast for the eyes. I have always enjoyed this movie and I had such a fun watching it. It is fun, exciting and pure entertaining. Simon West want's to direct the remake of the Blob that is coming out I think this year which is a stupid dumb idea! I don't want to see another remake of this film so no!I love Shawnee Smith as a bad ass - tough cheerleader, she is so beautiful, gorgeous and sexy, I am completely in Love with her! I love her to death in this film. Shawnee Smith will always be Meg Penny for me, not Amanda Young from Saw! I don't care about Saw or the franchise none of those horror films are my favorite! I rather watch films from the 80's and the Blob is one of my favorite monster creature movies! I saw this flick as a kid. Shawnee Smith is gorgeous in this film she saved her younger brother, she tried to save a younger kid Eddie as well and when The Blob eats and swallows a younger kid in the sever she jumps in the water trying to saves him and she couldn't. She fires a machine gun on the Blob and say's ""come on, you can do better than that!"". I love the music score from Michael Hoenig and I love the song on the end of the title Brave New Love by Alien. You also have Paul McCrane in from RoboCop (1987) after seeing him in this film, I recognized him right away, it is Emil M. Antonowsky from RoboCop! The movie has likable characters, fast paced, a lot's of action, fun bits of humor, Paul Flagg (Kevin Dillon) escapes from those government guys, jumps over this little bridge and gives the middle finger when he jumps over the bridge on his motorcycle. I love this scene it was memorable scene I remember it. In the opening scene he crashed down the bridge but now he jumped over which was excellent. Fun bits of dialogue, the budget was used very well against great special effects, I have no problems with them, it is one of my favorites of all time.This film is only shot an hour and thirty-five minutes which is not that long, it is like is said pure entertainment, I grow up with this flick and I love it. I disagree with the reviewers who say the original is much better than this version. I think quite the opposite is true. The 80's ""The Blob"" along with the 80's ""The Fly"" are two of the few remakes that I think far surpass the originals. Sure, it's a schlocky 80's horror movie, but taken in that context, it's damn good!A great script, an excellent combination of FX to achieve the look of the Blob, and absolute horror and carnage... I love it! This is a horror movie with BALLS. Within the first half hour, (spoiler alert) they kill off the guy we're expecting to be the star! They kill little kids! They kill off innocents, characters we like and want to live!This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original, puts an interesting twist into the plot, injects it with good FX, good acting and a decent budget, and you have something far superior to the original. Just like ""Little Shop of Horrors"" -- The cheap and dated original can never hold up to the musical remake.This flick get's a 10 out of 10 by me for been my favorite sci-fi horror flick of all time.",The Blob
75,cchase,A VAT of Lysol Won't Disinfect THIS Germ!,8,5 December 2008,"Most sequels and remakes or ""reimaginations,"" IMNSHO, are about as necessary and useful as having a second nose growing in the middle of your forehead. (And are just about as pleasant to watch.) But every so often, there's one that's redone so well and in a whole new way that it actually equals, if not surpasses the original. THE BLOB definitely fits into the latter category.The original source material that staunch purists know and love from the older Steve McQueen version is here, but with plenty of new updated ""wrinkles""; '80's style, of course. This time Shawnee Smith (in the best role of her career before the SAW series came along) actually is our ""hero"", and Kevin Dillon (Matt's younger sib, pre-ENTOURAGE) is (for lack of a better term) the ""heroine"" whom Smith's character constantly has to get out of some very nasty scrapes.In keeping with the ""new"" cynicism about placing unconditional trust in our government, the titular threat is now not simply some mindless, hungry extraterrestrial protozoan, but part of a secret government weapons development program, (hey, slow down there, folks! Do you REALLY wanna give these morons on the Hill any more bright ideas???) It's also refreshing to see Joe Seneca (CROSSROADS), who usually plays kindly old janitors and such cast as one ruthless old 'mutha', who considers anyone expendable at the cost of bringing his ""pet project"" to a successful conclusion. (Which also makes his ultimate comeuppance that more SA-weet!)Look for some '80's movie staples and dependable character actors to provide great support, like Art La Fleur, Jeffrey De Munn, Candy Clark, Ricky Paul Goldin, Paul McCrane and in a VERY abbreviated cameo, Donovan Leitch, (yes, girls, he may be cute but...well, you'll just have to see what happens. Don't get too attached to him; that's all I'll say.)Some of the visual effects may provoke stifled fits of the squirts-and-giggles, but the practical effects that were missing from the original are more than made up for here, and I still get a little queasy just thinking about them. But hey, the new-and-improved BLOB is a super-germ, and it just does what super germs do, (and if you need more research, see FANTASTIC VOYAGE.)One of the better films of its decade as far as the genre goes.",The Blob
76,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Fun, if imperfect, monster horror",7,27 June 2006,"One night, just outside of a quiet and small town, a bizarre meteor crashes. A man who goes to investigate finds a weird glop that jumps on his arm and puts him into a state of frenzy. Some young people take him to the hospital and we soon see that the weird substance has eaten most of him and it is still hungry...The result is a very entertaining monster flick with a very unusual monster - an amorphous blob. After films like Alien, Predator, The Thing, and others thinking of a good monster idea can be tough. Even John Carpenter's well crafted The Thing is a remake, but that didn't stop the film from becoming one of his best due to a good visceral interpretation of the story. The same goes for this film - a remake of an old movie with a very visceral and gory style. Featuring top-notch aesthetic and even some obviously aged, but nonetheless fun, old computer effects it is more of a thorough re-imagination like The Thing was.However, the film falls a bit on its face when it comes to creating suspense. Many scenes with the title monster are tense and the action good and the gore first-rate, but the connective scenes between them surprisingly lack in tension. With material ripe for an eerie atmosphere it is a shame to see this horror element not fully developed in the film. The result is a fun movie, but it could have been much better. Also the mad scientist/cold war element is a bit stale by today's standards.But, overall it is a fun little flick featuring a truly merciless monster that gobbles up just about anyone (even kids!). Horror/sci-fi fans will definitely want to check this flick out. 7/10Rated R: violence, horror images, and profanity",The Blob

78,Superunknovvn,Silly and full of gore - fans of 80's horror movies will love it,7,8 June 2008,"""The Blob"" is what 80's horror was about: mindless fun with a stupid story, a rebel without a cause-hero, his beautiful cheerleader-love interest and insane gore effects. Amazingly, the Blob still works as an 80's movie monster. If you have read the Stephen King-short story ""The Raft"" (or have seen the movie version in ""Creepshow 2""), you'll get an idea of how this is going down. A slimy creature of unknown origin wraps around its prey - that would be us humans - and digests it alive. That makes for some very cool death scenes and some of the best make up-effects, the 80's had to offer. And hey, if they don't look so great sometimes (a scene with a young Erika Eleniak comes to mind), they are still great to laugh at.See, you can only win with this movie. You're either amused by how dated the haircuts and effects are, or you're blown away by the movies' sheer boldness to show all the killings in detail and to even kill off kids (in a scene which might be among the most memorable of the whole genre).Having spoken of Stephen King earlier: Frank Darabont, director of King works such as ""The Mist"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", has co-written the screenplay for this movie, which gives it that extra King-feeling (only it works a lot better than many actual King-adaptations do). Chuck Russell, the guy who had made the best ""A Nightmare On Elm Street""-sequel just one year earlier, directed and Michael Hoenig wrote the eerie score.After an atmospheric intro, the movie starts off slow. The first few deaths may be a little disappointing, but soon ""The Blob"" gets some go. People start dying left and right, it becomes a downright massacre and after a big showdown we get one of those nice little cliffhangers, that were so prominent in 80's horror movies. And this one looks really great, like the final page of a comic book. Then the credits roll and some ridiculously bad 80's rock music kicks in. That's what I call a the perfect ending for a cheesy horror flick.As a whole ""The Blob"" isn't perfect, of course. It could have used some (deliberate) comedic relief instead of Kevin Dillon's constant straight face. In between the death scenes the movie slows down a bit too often, and the dialog is pretty lame for the most part.However, if you appreciate 80's horror movies, you will find a lot to love here. ""The Blob"" is one of the most overlooked big budget-flicks of the decade. Fans shouldn't miss it!",The Blob
79,Darkside-Reviewer,A great remake,7,7 October 2019,I first saw the original Blob movie with Steve Mcqueen back in college and really enjoyed it but I remember thinking how great the movie would be if it was more gory with more adult themes but obviously with the movie being made in the 50s in black and white and having a very small budget it is in it's own right a classic masterpiece.I only recently found out that there was a remake made in 1988 and it was more a gory horror movie so I of course gave it a watch and I am glad I did because this remake takes what I enjoyed about the original and adds to it the violence and gore the original lacked it's only downside I found is the characters are not very memorable and have your typical highschool teenager tropes you have the jock the cheerleader and the rebel and the adults are just as stereotypical the overprotective parent's the good sheriff with a deputy that's a jerk character even the shady government scientists this isn't to much of an issue though as the main attraction of the movie is of course the Blob monster who we get to watch eat the townsfolk stereotypes and all.The special effects in this movie hold up really well and are simular to the effects in The Thing (1982) using a combination of practical and special effects that look amazing and very bloody gory and gross when the Blob monster absorbs a victim it slowly melts there body away inside of it's pink transparent body still alive you see the terror on the victims faces as they struggle and try to scream in pain and terror as there body slowly melts away it's terrifying to watch and the effects make it look bloody gory and painful the only time I have seen body horror effects look this good is in The Thing (1982).I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys gory horror movies with great effects you will not be disappointed.,The Blob

I love how the movie gives a new explanation of the creature as it was a government experiment that was sent to space and has returned. The film has a very pre-""X-Files"" like feel to it with it's government conspiracy idea and the acting is great even from the co-stars Paul McCrane (""Robocop"" and ""Shawshank Redemption""), Candy Clark, Bill Mosley (""Devil's Rejects"") and Jeffery DuMunn. The special effects by Lyle Conway and Tony Garner are amazing even in these CGI times especially the icky gore effects in amazing detail especially the now infamous death in a kitchen sink sequence.

Comparing apples to apples here, the original movie is like a Sunday drive with your grandparents, slow but ominous. The remake is more like a Grand Prix race with a driver on speed. What the different tempo and special effects could not do is vastly improve upon the original. If this was your first exposure to The Blob, I would say you would hate the 50's version. If you saw that one first, then you will like this movie, just not quite as much. All in all this is a great updating, but it lacks some of the heart.",The Blob

There's more blood, more violence, more gross scenes, more death, you name it. This movie does not take as long to get to the point as the blob begins to absorb the entire town.Some scenes really shocked me. Some made me nearly gag.I liked Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith's characters. They weren't the typical ""struggling teenager with a complicated life with problems to overcome"".

88,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Scary And Terrifying SCI-FI/Horror Remake.",10,30 July 2014,"The Blob is an excellent,scary and terrifying SCI-FI/Horror remake that is filled with amazing direction,a great cast,a wonderful score and terrific special effects. All of those elements make The Blob not only a fantastic SCI-FI/Horror movie and remake but also one the most entertaining Horror movies of the 1980s.The Blob tells the story about a meteorite from space that lands in a small town in California and inside that meteorite is a Blob,jelly substance that kills,eats and absorbs anything and keeps growing and growing at an alarming rate. With their town in danger it is now up to teenagers Brian Flagg(Kevin Dillon)and Meg Penny(Shawnee Smith)to stop the creature and save the town.During the 1970s and 80s there was a wonderful wave of SCI-FI/Horror remakes of genre films from the 1950s. First it was Phillip Kaufman's outstanding and frightening Invasion Of The Body Snatchers in 1978,John Carpenter's excellent and terrifying remake The Thing in 1982,David Cronenberg's brilliant and unforgettable The Fly in 1986 then came Chuck Russell's The Blob in 1988 a remake of the 1958 Cult Classic that starred Steve McQueen in one of his early roles. While The Blob remake wasn't a big hit at the box office at the time,the film has gained a Cult following over the years and is not only considered one of the better remakes ever made but some have said was better than the original. What's great about The Blob remake is that director Chuck Russell takes the concept of the original film and takes it even further giving viewers a scary and intense experience doing not only a great remake but also a great re-imagining that is successful. And While The Blob 88 has some of the camp and silliness of the original the tone is much more serious in this film. The scares and suspense in The Blob are frightening and shocking because with each scary of the scenes there are surprises and unexpected deaths at every turn. What's also amazing about the scary scenes in The Blob and one the reasons I like the film is that the movie kills off characters that you don't expect to get killed off going against some of the conventions of Horror films and when people get killed off in this movie you are on the edge of year seat the whole time with tons of dread feeling anything can happen at anytime. The way that some of the characters are developed makes their deaths more horrific. I also like the fact that nearly the whole movie takes place over the course of one day and night and the fact that The Blob takes over the course of one day and night makes movie move fast and gives it a tight pace and makes the Action and chaos more insane. The blood and gore throughout The Blob is truly effective,disgusting and in my opinion is right up there with John Carpenter's The Thing and David Cronenberg's The Fly in terms of gross and horrific moments. This movie is not for people with weak stomachs so I highly suggest you don't eat anything while watching this film. What's disturbing about the villain The Blob is that it's not a person,it's a creature,a thing,a living organism that has no voice so you can't talk to or plead with it because all it does is eat and eat and gets bigger and bigger the more it eats and The Blob eats anything and anyone no matter what or who you are. The Blob is one cinemas most frightening and unforgettable creatures and will stick with you after you watch this film or the original. The main characters Brian Flagg and Meg Penny are memorable characters because while the two are basically teen Horror movie stereotypes(Brian is the typical teenage rebel,Meg,a typical teenage cheerleader)the two characters are very likable,sympathetic but are also tough,real and seem like unlikely heroes who would save a small town from a destructive creature but as a viewer we are on their side and root for them to succeed. The ending of The Blob is fantastic,haunting and leaves you with a creepy and unsettling feeling that will disturb you after the movie end. A great ending.The cast is great. Kevin Dillon is terrific as Brian,a young rebel who becomes a hero. Shawnee Smith is wonderful and beautiful as Meg,a cheerleader that wants Brian's help. Donovan Leitch does a fine job as Paul,a Football jock that's Meg's date. Jeffrey DeMunn is great as always as Sheriff Herb Geller,the local lawman. Candy Clark is good as Fran,a waitress. Joe Seneca is fantastic as Dr. Meddows,a mysterious scientist. Paul McCrane is fun and memorable as Deputy Bill Briggs,Geller's deputy. Del Close(Reverand Meeker),Beau Billingslea(Moss),Art LeFleur(Mr. Penny),Sharon Spelman(Mrs. Penny),Michael Kenworthy(Kevin Penny),Douglas Emerson(Eddie),Ricky Paull Goldin(Scott),Robert Axelrod(Jennings),Jack Nance(Doctor)and Erika Eleniak(Vicki De Soto)give good performances as well.The direction by Chuck Russell is outstanding,with Russell always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and atmosphere. Great direction,Russell.The score by Michael Hoenig is impressive,suspenseful and fits with the Action and tone of the movie. There is also a song by Alien(Brave New Love)that plays during the end credits.The special make-up and visual effects in The Blob are stunning, realistic and add to the film.In final word,if you love Horror and SCI-FI,I highly suggest you see The Blob an excellent and scary SCI-FI/Horror remake that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Blob
89,loomis78-815-989034,A worthy remake is entertaining horror fun.,8,20 April 2013,"A meteor falls from outer space into the woods outside a small town. A homeless man goes to investigates and the red ooze poring out attach's itself to his hand. Troubled teenager Brain (Dillon) tries to help the man but he runs out onto the road where he is found by Paul (Leitch) and his cheerleader girlfriend Meg (Smith). Paul thinks Brian has something to do with it, and insists that all three of them take him to the hospital. Soon after arriving, the old man is gruesomely consumed by the Blob which then attacks and kills Paul in similar fashion. Brian and Meg try to warn everyone in the small town what is going on but no one will listen. Using the sewer system to move, the Blob continues to grow and kill until a military group shows up and begins its investigation at the expense of the small town. This super fun remake of the cult 1958 film is an absolute joy to watch. Director Chuck Russell working with a script he co-wrote with Frank Darabont keeps his pacing fast and adds some great atmosphere, especially early on in this film. The gory special effects are shocking and first rate to anything going on at this time. Russell, fresh of his impressive direction on ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part III"" knows how to make an effective horror film. The suspense is excellent when the Blob attacks Candy Clark's character Fran in a telephone booth and ends in wonderfully gory fashion! After a fantastic first hour, the film hits a few bumps with the introduction of the government group investigating. These Military types with their own agenda are quite tedious and don't add much to the story. The ending is a bit predictable as well but it doesn't really matter because at the end you will have had a great time watching this under rated horror film. This overlooked gem has great effects, nice atmosphere, good musical score and top notch gore. The most fun you will have watching red Jell-O kill people.",The Blob
90,Mr Parker,Slowly Dissolve with the Blob!,7,10 August 2006,"This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. I mean, come on, what more do you want from a movie that has a slimy pink blob oozing around, slowly digesting the people it consumes? I'm completely at ease with this offering and few things make me feel as good as watching people getting slapped to the ground by giant tentacles or policeman getting folded the wrong way round while trying to set up a barricade. I like seeing people getting sucked through a drainpipe and I also like seeing people slowly dissolve while trying to scream from inside the pulsing, pink mess. People who deserve it get theirs, as well as innocent people. Even kids aren't safe! I love the fact that people you think are gonna pull through don't. I think Chuck Russell did a solid, respectable job with this film, a remake of the cult classic from the 50's. The gore is just right and the Blob itself is pretty nasty. Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon do their jobs well and I thought Del Close and Joe Seneca were both fantastic in this.Bottom line: Want entertaining, B-movie fare? Want to see what a movie theater looks like when you have people running for their lives screaming from the giant piece of chewed up gum that decided to show up? Want to see people slowly dissolve? (Forgive me, but the words, ""slowly dissolve"" have a strange appeal to me) Then go ahead and check this flick out.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.

Now this is a film worth watching, more so than the original.The plot is somewhat similar to the original but with some nice twists. It's implied that the blob is an alien but later it's revealed that the blob is really a microbe mutated by a orbital military experiment gone wrong. Naturally, the government tries to contain and capture the creature but to no avail.The human characters are little more likable even though there some stereotypes like the caring leading lady, the tough guy loner, the stupid priest, mad scientist, etc. Unlike the original blob creature which seems like a mindless, slow moving scavenger, the new blob is a menacing predator that chases it's prey and doesn't mess around. You actually see how it feeds on its victims: it melts you down in a horrifying way with some organic acid and then absorbs the remains. No one is spared by this creature once it gets a hold of you, not even a little kid. Yes, you see a kid die in the worst way! Poor little guy.Bottom line, an excellent monster movie and remake.

Sure, it's b-movie material, but it knows it, and the outrageous special effects and disgustingly decadent death scenes are the real stars at hand. While a handful of effects have not aged well (most noticeably during the finale) they only serve to add to the charm of the film.

Sadly, the movie doesn't go far enough into one or the other direction. It is not purposefully funny enough to be a dark comedy and too funny to be a horror movie, which plants it much closer to the so-bad-that-it's-good territory than to any other.

98,TCurtis9192,THE BLOB,3,29 February 2020,"""THE BLOB"" (1988, Russell) was one of those big budget remakes of horror and sci-fi films from the 50's and 60's. They were kickstarted, I believe, by the sheer brilliance and success of Philip Kaufman's 1978 ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"" and immortalised by ""THE THING"" (1982, Carpenter) and ""THE FLY"" (1986, Cronenberg).""THE BLOB"" (1958, Yeaworth) was an unexpectedly big hit. The monster captured imaginations everywhere and camp aside it was effectively scary. It's pointless to compare the two versions and say which is better, but it is worth pointing out that the remake didn't garner anywhere near the favourable attention the original did.I personally found the 1988 version embarrassing. Yes the effects are great and it was a great idea to make it super gory but the comedy element wasn't needed and the cynicism hasn't aged well. I also detest the Kevin Dillon character and resented having to accept him as the lead character next to Shawnee Smith, who is fine.I would only recommend it for the effects.",The Blob
99,MF210,"Not perfect, but an entertaining B-movie",7,17 October 2009,"My rating: *** out of ****.Spoilers! I will admit that I have not seen the original, ""The Blob"", the 50's film with Steve McQueen as the leading hero. I will admit I have no intention of seeing a cheesy ""horror"" film from the 50's, they just don't have much value for me. That being said, I admit to enjoying this 80's remake of the original, which I thought was a surprisingly entertaining B-film.The story is pretty basic. A meteorite crash lands in the woods of a small California town. An old hermit discovers an oozing substance in the meteorite, which attaches itself to his hand. He is found by three teenagers and brought to a hospital to have the substance removed. However, the substance devours him and in turn grows bigger and becomes a big threat to the town. The film centers around two teenagers, Brian (Kevin Dillon), a loner with a spotty criminal record, and Meg (Shawnee Smith), a high school cheerleader. Meg's date is killed by the Blob at the hospital right after the old man dies and she then turns to Brian for answers. They both encounter government agents who storm the town and meet Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca), who knows more about the Blob then he reveals.The plot of the Blob sounds like your standard B-movie and that certainly would be an accurate description. Director Chuck Russell's resume is spotty with the enjoyable (Eraser, The Mask) and the unbearable (Bless The Child, The Scorpion King), but he knows how to handle the material here. The Blob is unpretentious and fun, it's exactly the right running time and perfectly paced. There's nothing complex about the film nor any hidden meaning, it's good, gory fun.Speaking of gory, one has to mention the special effects. We see peoples faces dissolve in the Blob, arms being ripped off, and a man being sucked down a sink (my favorite). Another enjoyable scene is in the woods when a jock gets his date intoxicated and reaches down his dates shirt only to see the Blob has inhabited her body and leads to a bloody demise, it's a shocking scene and recalls John Carpenters The Thing, which came out only 6 years earlier. The Blob itself is a mixed bag, some scenes look great but then shots from a farther distance look fake. Overall, the special effects hold up pretty well though for a movie from 1988.No one in the cast ever made the A-list, but I give credit to Dillon and Smith. On paper, they are playing types, Dillon your typical bad boy and Smith the pretty cheerleader. It is a credit to them that they actually make their characters likable and not seem like fodder for the Blob to chase after. Smith is beautiful and charming, Dillon shows charisma not unlike his more famous brother, Matt. The only other actor to make an impression is Del Close who plays Reverend Meeker, who sees the Blob as a sign of the apocalypse. Close chews the scenery a bit but presents an individual who is fairly creepy and truly believes the end of the world is near.Pardon me if I reveal an important plot point but I liked how the Blob challenged authority figures, meaning our government. It is revealed that the Blob is actually a man made virus that went awry, it was created by the government for biological warfare with the Soviets as the film takes place during the end of the Cold War. This is nothing new in films from the 80's in particular, Ghostbusters certainly painted a not-so nice picture of the EPA, but it's still nice to see films show that government may not always be there to help.I liked the Blob, it was an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes. At times, it recalled The Thing in certain scenes and in the special effects. No, don't get your hopes up, The Blob is not on the level with John Carpenter's near-masterpiece, it doesn't have the paranoid-cloaked atmosphere and the acting was superior. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by the film and would recommend it, especially now around Halloween.",The Blob

There also seems to be a a few references thrown at the horror genre, such as when the mother of two boys wanting to go watch a slasher flick says it's trash. From what I remember of the original Blob film, this version is a lot more watchable, but not as classic. If you're after a cheesy film to watch with friends, you can't go wrong with The Blob.

I just can't get over that dude's hair! Riding around on the motorcycle, all cool - wouldn't anyone tell him how ridiculous he looked?

102,JurijFedorov,Silly high grade B-movie,7,15 October 2021,"It's some silly fun. The movie is pretty much what you can expect from an 80's horror movie. If you have seen a few you know exactly what to expect here. But if you don't know it's: a few main sets and not too much single character focus, the movie experience is the goal not the journey, it's about the monster, no CGI but plenty of amazing effects, terrible acting, characters are predictable and fit exactly into the typical character molds, if you expect a deeper movie or plot then look somewhere else.People seem to adore the 80's effects from before CGI took over. It's pretty cool to see actual slime and actual dolls used as monsters. Everything here would look terrible if made with CGI even in 2021 with a huge budget. Everything here feels real. I don't know when the last good non-CGI monster movie was made, but it must be over 25 years ago now? So it's kinda a totally forgotten genre of movies that you probably have never seen if you only watch movies post 2000. If you like practical special effect you do need to watch these older movies and this one is one of the main ones to watch. But you also need to understand that the special effects is the movie. It's not about characters, growth, personal journeys or themes. It's about some monster killing people. Often the special effect artists got to decide everything about the plot, events and characters as it took a huge team to create the effects. So everything else is usually very low quality. That's what all these 60s to 90's monster flicks were about. They started with very cheap productions then ramped them up to max in the 80's. In the 90's they started to die out very fast as CGI replaced them. In 2000's they were practically gone. Now you can find a few smaller and cheaper monster movies in this style and they are all CGI. They also lack the silliness, they tend to be extremely serious and gloomy now.This one has great effects and some proper script writing related to the fight against the monster. Of course the characters are jocks, rebels, cheerleaders, cops. It's all movie characters with no deeper wants or needs besides a single character trait like: want to mate, want a boyfriend, want to catch the criminal, want to be the good guy. But this time around the fight vs. The monster actually is well-written as they go from area to area and use the variou tools in the different places. Everything makes sense in that aspect which frankly is not a certainty in these B-movies made to scare and show off cool effects.I think this is a watch. It's not a must-watch as it lacks that extra depth and movie quality. But it's a good waste of time. Just be aware of what you are getting into here. The acting is bad, the people are making nonsensical decisions, the shots and style is silly and over the top, it's about creating a cool movie world not about telling a greater emotional story.",The Blob
103,HorrorFan1984,The Blob,7,28 July 2020,"After a meteor falls from the sky, it'll be up to a couple of teenagers to stop The Blob from wiping out an entire town in this late 80's remake of a beloved classic.Just like the original, a meteor falls out of the sky and releases a strange slimey blob like substance. After it consumes an old mans arm, our main characters Meg, Brian, and Paul pick up him and take him to the hospital. The substance kills the old man in a very gruesome way and then murders Paul right in front of Meg's eyes. The police don't believe Meg when she says it was the blob that did it. It'll be up to her and Brian to defeat the blob before the body count rises even further.This remake was sadly a box office bomb, making only 8 million dollars on a 10 million dollar budget, but I can't see why. I thought director Chuck Russell did a really good job at creating the eerie and ominous atmosphere of the sleepy town which the blob would inevitably attack. This remake also gives us much greater special effects thanks to the times and the larger budget. The gore and death scenes are way more graphic than the 1958 version, very realistic (especially ""the sink scene""). The Blob itself is also way more dangerous than in the original, burning through material and human skin like acid.Acting wise, we get Shawnee Smith who is our lead heroine Meg. I enjoyed her performance a lot, she really made me root for Meg to stay alive and defeat The Blob. Kevin Dillon did a fine job in the male lead, he had some spark with Smith. Candy Clark and Jeffrey De Munn are equally amazing in supporting roles of the sheriff and diner waitress who have a bit of chemistry.The Blob 1988 is a fine remake to a classic horror flick made 30 years prior.

You can not compare to John Rambo and Rocky Balboa as are two different kinds. Indiana Jones is very comics while Stallone adheres more to reality, trying to be as close to reality.

Compared to the original version (1958), this Blob movie has a lot more gore and better acting. If you are a fan of cheesy movies, you will still be entertained.

It never takes itself too seriously, and it features some of the most grotesque (and inventive) death scenes to come out of the 80′s (which is saying a lot, as any subscriber to the macabre will tell you that the 1980s was one of the most prolific periods for this oft- unappreciated genre). That being said, I've decided to review it solely because it's the exact type of movie one would find dwelling underneath a mountain of $2.99 DVDs at Wal-Mart. An uneducated person might dismiss it as being just another low budget snooze-fest, but that uneducated person would, of course, be incorrect in his/her assumptions about this surprisingly fun movie that was penned by none another than Frank Darabont (and a handful of others).The Blob is about well a blob. A meteorite crashes on the outskirts of a small Colorado town, and the only person—at least for the time being—to notice its presence is a homeless man who spends his day crushing cans and playing with his dog. When he investigates the fiery crash site, he finds little more than a piece of smoldering rock. But wait—what's that gelatinous substance pulsing in the center of said meteorite? Only a sane person would pick up a stick and poke it, right? Of course. That's exactly what this gentleman does, only to have the ooze spring to life and attach itself to his hand. He's soon aided by the resident juvenile delinquent (who, of course, turns out not to be such a bad guy after all), a football star, and a cheerleader. Yeah, that's right: the traditional teenage fodder is present and accounted for in The Blob. Thankfully, though, the blob is an equal opportunity eater. No one is safe.And I mean no one.In an unprecedented move—and one that's usually regarded as a cardinal sin in the world of horror movies—a child is eventually killed and digested by the blob. As shocked as I was by this, I have to give credit where it's due. Kudos to The Blob and everyone associated with it for making such a gutsy decision. This sort of thing actually causes the film to garner a fair amount of suspense: if you know children aren't even safe, then logic would dictate that anyone could be picked off at any time. And that's exactly what happens. You'll simultaneously gasp and laugh as the amorphous slime traverses sewers and street corners in an effort to digest every living thing in the immediate vicinity. That, I think, is one of the things that makes this decidedly over-the-top horror movie work so well: it's not about a guy in a hockey mask trying to carve up people. The antagonist doesn't have any backstory, and isn't motivated by emotion, revenge, etc. It's a relatively primitive being (in terms of intelligence, at least) that wants to eat. It's acting on sheer primal instinct, and that's it.Had this been the entirety of the plot, there's a strong chance that The Blob would've elicited an exceptionally strong cult following. But there's a twist: the meteorite that fell to Earth was not, in fact, a meteorite. As it turns out, it was a well-disguised American bioweapon satellite. In the latter half of the film it's explained that the blob started out as a small culture of bacteria which mutated due to the absence of gravity. Instead of the blob being a completely awesome alien life form, it's nothing more than the result of an attempt to overpower Russia via the use of biological warfare. How lame is that?As insignificant as this plot point may seem, it really hampers the overall effect of the movie. It's completely unnecessary, and feels as if it's the ultimate form of contrivance. I mean, let's face it: the movie is called The Blob. People are paying to see it because they want to see horrific deaths filled with gore and cheese. No one goes into a movie like this expecting political commentary, and, unless it's handled in exactly the right way, it comes off as a botched attempt at adding subtext to a movie that doesn't need any.So where does that leave us? The fact remains that The Blob is a well made horror movie with great effects. It's fun, engrossing, and entirely creative—well, at least for 3/4 of the runtime. It's certainly worth a rental on a night you want to watch something mindless with a group of friends, and I'd recommend serving a little Jell-O to enhance the already heightened level of corniness that is about to *er-hem* consume you.",The Blob
107,benjyboom,80s cheesiness in the best way creates a great monster movie,7,11 September 2020,"Everything in this movie Carrie's a really fun, cheesy tone, and even when everything says its shouldn't work, it does. The only thing that feels very serious is the violence, with all of it's horrible noise and slurpy, wet visuals. The characters are quite cliche, and I could see that being annoying if you're not into, but it works so well as a ""teenagers vs monster"" story. The film takes all it needs from the originals, and adds so much more to create an essential summer horror.",The Blob
108,robert3750,Awful remake,1,2 July 2017,"The film starts off well, but instead of a good, creepy monster movie, it decides it wants to be about a silly government conspiracy. The mixing of genres doesn't work. I see that it totally flopped at the box office. I also see that in the forums I frequent, it's never mentioned as being a worthy remake. Both of these things are well deserved.",The Blob
109,80sHorror,Classic cheesy 80's video nasty with plenty of gore.,10,17 December 2011,"A classic 80's horror with plenty of gore. Cheesy story, great for a night in with a few beers. It is currently the trend in Hollywood at the moment to remake classics, and horror is the biggest victim of all genres. Movies such as Dawn of the Dead, the Texas Chiansaw Massacre, The Fog, When a Stranger Calls and The Omen have all received this treatment and the end is result is always the same. Crap! But in the 1980's some truly classic remakes were released that were superior to the originals in many ways (usually because the director was a fan of the original and wanted to pay homage to that). John Carpenter's The Thing and David Cronenberg's The Fly were far more impressive than the 1950's movies they were inspired by and that can also be said for the 1988 remake of The Blob. Inspired by a rather naff Steve McQueen movie, Chuck (A Nightmare On Elm Street 3, The Mask) Russell's reimagining was a fun, gore-packed sci-fi horror that featured Matt Dillon's younger brother Kevin as the lead anti-hero, with Saw's Shawnee Smith as the cheerleader-cum-heroine, who try to save small town America from a jello-like substance that devours everything in its path. While a little cheesy in places, this movie is hugely enjoyable and should be a lesson to modern directors that if you're going to remake a movie, do it properly!There is a glut of horror remakes rearing their heads at the moment but for my money this is one of the best around and dare I say it,even better than the original: Kevin Dillon gives an incredible performance as the leather-jacketed reluctant hero as do the rest of the cast. The story,direction and special effects are similarly impressive and memorable. The sink scene in particuliar sticks in the mind. This is the way a remake of a popular movie should be done:well worth adding to your collection.",The Blob
110,blazesnakes9,"Kind of cheesy, but fun",7,26 October 2013,"Remakes tend to be very disappointing to the average audience. Some remakes are very good like the Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong of 2005, or William Friedkin's remake of the French film, Wages of Fear, Sorcerer. The Blob fits well, but not great. The original Blob came out in 1958 and it told the story of a meteorite from outer space crash landing in a small, quiet town. In that movie, the Blob ate everyone who got in its way, slowly and quickly getting bigger and bigger as it kept devouring people. 30 years later, a remake was born. Instead of Steve McQueen playing the leading role as a teenage rebel, who tries to warn the townspeople, Kevin Dillon plays the teenage rebel and he is convincing as the leading man. Like in the original, the meteorite crashes into the ground and quickly starts to devour the teens. Meanwhile, the police thinks that Dillon killed the first victim, but they realize that what they are dealing with is something worse than a punk kid. Dillon's character realizes that a scientific government team is investigating the remains of the meteorite and tried to cover up the trouble and focusing mainly on the creature, rather than worry about the town. Soon enough, the Blob goes a wild rampage devouring everyone that gets in its way. It eats up teenagers at a movie theater, wreaks havoc on the town and destroys the entire scientific government team. The Blob has a good premise and has a nice touch on the science-fiction/horror element. But, the movie is not as great as the original because this time, it's set in 1988, where teenagers are the main movie-going audience and behave a lot more different than the teenagers in the original. Instead, the movie shows a parody of slasher films, whereas in the original, the movie showcases a B monster movie. I also like how the humor is present in a movie like this. In one scene, the supporting character played by Shawnee Smith, goes out with a guy that was in her father's drugstore. Of course, his buddy has to buy him condoms and the father realizes that it's the same kid that didn't want to buy the condoms himself. (His friend had to paid for them). There's a parody of routine slasher films, in which a local movie theater showcases a parody of what looks like a Friday the 13th rip-off. There are a lot of fine performances by Shawnee Smith, who also plays a teenage girl, who also tries to warn the town. Her relationship with Kevin Dillon's character in this movie is very good and sort of sweet. I like the special effects in The Blob, which is cheesy, but that kind of set-up is what I like about this movie. It doesn't push itself as hard and it's structure and story-telling makes it fun to follow and enjoy. The Blob is a good natural sci-fi remake that does work. ★★★ 3 stars.",The Blob
111,jamhorner,The Blob is Back Again,9,11 July 2007,"This movie was a couple of levels above the 1950's version with Steve McQueen, but just a little. It had tons of gore, creature effects, 80s cheese and it provided an explanation and reason as to why The Blob came here, a mystery many people wanted to know. In this one, it did not come from space. I, however, was horribly frightened by this movie when I was younger and I saw when the blob ate Meg Penny's boyfriend in the clinic. Now when I'm 18 and I watch this movie, I have a deeper appreciation for what was a flop then, but now a huge cult classic. This film did not have great acting, but it wasn't the worst and as far as the love plot that's at the gooey center of all the blood and wax, it like anything else that I've seen in on WGN. But I love this movie anyway, despite that.What I especially enjoyed was the violence and the gore that was mega upped in this version. This aspect is what really scared me. They really emphasized on how vicious and acidic the blob really is that the original portrayed it as. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the original but I think this one really heightened the intensity that the blob has over humans. There are points were the gore can be ridiculously amazing and unnecessary (i.e. it involves a kitchen sink and a projection booth). Not even kids are safe or innocent in the demented eye of the blob, which was stunning. They managed to keep in infamous theater scene and upped the gore in it, what made this scene even more intense was the strobe effect that they used. There weren't any ""jump out scares"" in this film as there is ""bloody scares."" I think if they added this, it would be a whole lot scarier but thank God it's rumored that there is a remake coming out in 2010.Another great aspect of this movie is the multiple plot outlines that overlap each other numerous times throughout. It has a very wooden love story that has a predictable end and a very worn out rising action, but what separates this love tale from the others is how the love tale begins. Just when you think that the hot quarterback is going to be the hero, he isn't..anything..anymore. What I want to applaud is the whole story behind the blob and it's mysterious crash appearance. Honestly, I thought it was an alien but I was dead wrong. Though, because of this plot, it had a very presentable theme of America's ridiculous extreme measures towards the Cold War. There are also some mini plots throughout this movie that just when you think that they may lead somewhere, it's gets cutoff by the blob. Absolutely fantastic.What this movie did not have is good acting, but it did not have horrible acting, it had okay acting in some sense. There were some notable one-lines by Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (i.e. ""Trying to keep there leftovers fresh""). There is some horrible acting by Joe Seneca, Paul McCrane and Donovan Leitch but a great performance by Del Close who plays Reverend Meeker. Though his character has a very small part, later on in the movie his character becomes dark and sets up for a sequel to The Blob. His performance was haunting and charismatic. There was just something about his character that made him uncomfortable but heartwarming at the same time.Overall, I think this movie was a pebble-stone in American horror and will always go down as a true American Cult Classic. Despite some of the crucial elements that make a good horror movie were not met in this movie, it still was a good ride that is very memorable. In the end isn't that what makes a great 80s movie, a movie with an okay plot, some wooden acting, a lot of blood, a remake, something to do with biochemicals or mutations and Shawnee Smith? I think it is. I think that this is a movie that is worth checking out to horror fans of all kinds, but for little horror fans, this may be a bit tense to view. What I especially like is the end credit music, the song Brave New Love by Alien, which was a Swedish band that died in 89' but had great music. It was a very unknown band, but I'm glad it was in The Blob.",The Blob

You see it in the opening scene and mentally beg that it be cut off immediately, but as the film proceeds, it grows steadily.

Couldn't resist the opportunity to see the 1988 remake as a teenager. Even though it's your standard ""monster-run-amok"" movie, it's still good because The Blob is so unique, and that lends itself to unusual ways to kill people off. For example, the old guy in the forest pokes the baby blob with a stick, which promptly crawls up the stick and begins eating old guy; the movie theater scene where The Blob eats the guy running the projector and then attacks the crowd watching a horror movie. Would like to have seen a little more of a battle royale at the end between the military and The Blob, but there are some good action scenes here and the movie overall is well done. Sidebar: I'd like to see The Blob fight dinosaurs or Godzilla someday. I hear there's going to be a remake next year, so I'm anxiously awaiting. I give it a 7 out of 10.",The Blob
116,fishermensmell,Blobbin' Brilliant! Amazing effects and a simple script deliver top entertainment,7,1 February 2021,"A really enjoyable and well-made late-80s sci-fi/action B-movie. This was way better and more entertaining that I thought it would be and I'm scratching my head as to why this isn't a huge cult hit (OK, I know ""huge cult"" is a paradox - but you know what I mean!)The first thing I loved about this film was the Twin Peaks vibe. It's set in a small town populated with familiar, but quirkily rendered characters. It even has Jack Nance in a small role! The film pulls no punches in the death toll and cycles through quite a few characters who I assumed were the lead protagonists in short order before the real leads are revealed: they begin as high school tropes (the bad boy biker and the prom queen) who when put under pressure display qualities that allow them to grow as they struggle to save their town. Both roles are well acted by Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon and I was rooting for them all along. The worst thing about this film is ""bad boy"" Kevin Dillon's long hair - it's been fashioned in a 70s style that makes him look like a member of Emerson Lake & Palmer. But aside from that he does a great job of getting the audience on side as the troubled kid who's actually just misunderstood.The best thing about the film are the visual effects. These are used to really gruesome and stomach-churning effect. I've seen a lot of gory horror films - some really nasty Italian stuff from the 70s and 80s; Asian stuff from the 90s etc - but there's something so gross about the Blob and the way it kills its victims; honestly, I wasn't expecting something this visceral. It's also really creative and some of the deaths will have you laughing as you retch. Aside from a few tell-tale blue screen shots, these physical effects mostly looked utterly believable and I honestly wonder if the big studios can pull this stuff off today or whether this art has been lost.The script adds in a plot twist involving a govt. conspiracy, which feels very X-Files and I think works well to introduce an additional element of mystery, intrigue and danger.Add in a really good synthy score (in the vein of John Carpenter) and you've got a movie that over-delivers on its promises and serves up a big blobby helping of fun!",The Blob

The monster is fast and relentless and everyone is a target sympathetic and nasty alike. Not exactly a ""Game of Thrones"" plot but the action pulls you along enough to not look around too much.Most remakes (lookin' at you, Rob Zombie) bungle almost everything that made the originals good, but this one cranks up both realism and intensity. Worthwhile movie, even with Kevin Dillon's '80s do (stay strong, Bunny).Watchable for: Candy Clark, Jeff DeMunn in a pre-Walking Dead lead role, the crazed preacher at the end, Shawnee Smith bein' cute and the effects are actually kind of special for 1988.

Equal parts ham and cheese, this flick aspires only to deliver schlocky fun. And boy does it succeed.Kevin Dillon overplays the snarky rebel with tongue-in-cheek glee. Shawnee Smith, who will never be mistaken for Meryl Streep, glides through the proceedings with an I-can't-act obliviousness that actually enhances the film.

As the organism consumes everything in its path, growing larger with each victim, cheerleader Meg (Shawnee Smith) teams with the local bad boy Brian (Kevin Dillon) to fight it off. When a secret government department shows up, Meg and Brian must now get to the truth.The brilliance of this film is the practical effects. Director Chuck Russell trusted his effects team to carry this film. The imaging and realism bring out the true horror. There are some special effects areas that are lacking, mainly the cgi and green screen work. All of that is overshadowed by the fantastic practical work on display.The pacing of this film is also a key player in its success. Russell, as well as fellow writer Frank Darabont, are relentless in killing their darlings. When you know no one is safe, it adds a layer of tension to an already grotesque film. The production design brings a small town feeling and helps contain the story as well.Besides the underwhelming CGI in the film, the biggest downfall is the acting. A couple performances stand out but are small roles. This film is carried by the special effects, so adding a cast to get behind would have sealed the deal.The Blob is a fantastic remake of the 1958 classic and has done it's predecessor justice. Having developed a cult following over the years after a disappointing showing at the box office, The Blob is an entertaining monster movie.

For starters, it's a remake of a 50s B-horror flick about some space Jell-O that eats a small town. Sounds like a recipe for disaster, a train wreck waiting to happen, doesn't it? Not in the hands of mad genius' Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont. These two sure throw a helluva party! And with a budget of about $10 million (huge for a horror film at that time) they manage to dazzle us with clever uses of special effects techniques. I had no idea space Jell-O could move that fast!Darabont and Russell provide a script packed full of surprises and pure mayhem. I really enjoy not being able to predict who's going to be lunch in a movie, and this movie has a way of devouring some of the most likable characters when you least expect it. What's that you say? Likable characters in a dead teenager flick? Can't be! Yes, it's true, you might actually be torn between rooting for the Blob or the townsfolk. But I won't blame you for rooting for the Blob. It is very cool to watch something grab people with giant pink tentacles and digest them in front of their loved ones' eyes. This is truly a horror film with some brains, and I think it measures up with anything made today. The special effects (way before CGI) are well done and impressive, not to mention gory.

You went into the cinema or video store to see a movie called ""the Blob"". What would you expect: Oscar winning performances, an intellectually challenging story? It's bad, but in a good way.

It has some interesting scenes, as the one where a man gets pulled head first into a kitchen sink.

The plot does not keep you interested throughout, too much of the action takes place either on the mountains or in the sewers. the killings by the blob get to be boring. I particularly disliked this time around that some very good people get killed, people I thought would be around trying to nail the blob. The last killing was particularly unnecessary and annoying.

Although there are no actors as charismatic as Steve McQueen, there are several characters you become attached to and you hope that they live, but they don't. The first character to die that you come to like is Paul who unfortunately meets his end in the hospital, being digested alive by the Blob. Next is Paul's friend who was planning to have sex with his date while she was unconscious. Fran is killed by the Blob in a phone booth but not before showing her the half-digested remains of Sheriff Herb Geller who was going to save her. The suspense of the Blob surrounding the phone booth had me on edge.The main scientist, Meddows, at first seems nice but it's son revealed that's he the main human villain, trapping Brian and Megg and one of his own men in the sewers to be devoured by the Blob, parking a van so one of it's tires covers the manhole. The scientist who was trapped with them has a rocket launcher, which blows up not only the manhole cover but also the van! Meddows gets his when his is killed and digested by the Blob.In this movie, no characters are safe. The people you think are going to live are killed with the exception of Brain and Meg. Hell, even a young child is dragged underwater by the Blob. Upon jumping in to try and save the kid, Meg is greeted by the kid's half digested body which is screaming in pain.Some characters that you think are going to die (like Reverend Meeker) actually survive, though Meeker has burn scars by the end.The Blob is revealed to not be an alien this time, but a government weapon project. At first, I felt that this was a stupid change but the movie was able to run with it.At the very end, Meeker, who has now lost his mind, shows the small living Blob he has trapped in a jar and says it is the apocalypse and he will release it when God gives him a sign. It's a chilling ending that thankfully didn't result in a sequel.One last thing, there are several editing gags in the film. The first, Brian is preparing to do a stunt jump with his motorbike. The movie cuts to the crowd at the local football game chanting ""GO"" repeatedly. The second, there's a shot of the blob slurping up the can man's arm which cuts to a kid slurping Jell-O off his plate.Overall, this is a great remake when compared to the original. It's well-written and very suspenseful and tense in some places. It does a good job at building up characters who you think will live before killing them off and the gore is top notch, even scary.

126,Horror_Metal,The Blob (1988) is a great remake!,8,6 December 2005,"The first time I saw this movie, it scared the daylights out of me. This truly is a horror film and I get shocked every time I watch it. That's pretty powerful right there. The storyline has been changed around a lot and in my opinion, isn't as good as the old one but this is still a terrific 80's monster movie.There is no opening theme this time (that would have made it campy) but the kool thing about the beginning of this movie is that it makes you think that Paul (the good boy jock) is the main character when it is really the rebellious motorcycle riding leather jacket wearing juvenile delinquent punk Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon), who becomes one of my favorite movie heroes of all time. Whatever happened to Kevin anyway? Well, a meteorite lands (just like last time) and an old man discovers the blob, which attaches itself to his hand, from the meteorite rubble. Paul and his cheerleader girlfriend (Shawnee Smith) find the old man and Flagg, who was the first to discover the parasite on the old man, and go to the hospital where the Blob completely devours the old man then kills Paul in a truly gruesome and terrifying scene. The Blob consumes more people including a young child (!) and Flagg and the cheerleader discover that the blob was man made and a product of germ warfare after meeting a bunch of men in strange uniforms who are the ones responsible for all the damage. They created the capsule that the silmeball was in and sent it onto space where it mutated and can now hunt down its victims. The blob attacks a movie theater in a really shocking scene that makes the same part in the original look like a Care Bears episode. Flagg and the cheerleader finally stop the blob by freezing it (as usual) with a cryogenic truck and a reverend, who was badly burned by accident, has kept a small piece of the blob in a jar for years and will let it loose on mankind when the lord gives him a sign, as he thinks it will be responsible for the end of the world.So yeah, this movie is a lot scarier and gorier than the original but is it better? Nope. The original just had more heart and will always be the best no matter what future Blob movies come my way. This movie is an excellent watch though and I try to see it as much as I can when it comes on TV. There are some things I don't like such as the blob being a predator for germ warfare and how some of the likable characters met horrible fates but all in all, this movie is more good than bad and will always remain one of my favorites. I hear there will be another remake which is good news and bad news. The good news is that it will most likely follow the original storyline and be more true to its source material. The bad news is that I wanted a sequel to this, after the ending set up for one. And I'm also sick of this ridiculous recent slew of remakes because no one can be creative and has to copy off someone else. King Kong is the only remake I'm excited for. And I definitely wouldn't mind seeing another version of the Blob. All in all, this is an excellent horror film and is a worthy entry to the Blob series.",The Blob
127,hippiegal,Beware of the killer silly putty!,6,11 October 2001,"I'd like to say that I enjoy both the Blob movies. Simply because the Blob is a great concept for a monster. It's gross, quiet and munches on people with out leaving bodies around. The thing I enjoy about this movie is how they improved on the monster. It's faster,more scary and gets far more screen time than in the original. Since you get to see the Blob eat people in gory detail, it's almost scary. The rest of the movie unfortunately reminded me of formula 80's teen horror. You have the hoodlum, the football player, the cheerleader, the smart aleck little brother, the housewife mom of the last two and on and on. The amusing thing is how the original also wallows in 50's teen movies cliches as well. Some things never change in Hollywood I guess. I liked the twist on the plot about the Government agents and their agenda with the Blob. It reminded of similar story lines that X-Files would do a billion times. Only this was before X-Files(which borrows greatly from bad sci-fi and horror anyway. In a good way, might I add.) Overall monster A+ the rest of the movie C+",The Blob

129,Logic404,"Fun, Funny and Fantastic!",9,30 May 2006,I loved the humour in this film greatly. It added a lot to the mood of the events that transpired.One of the few problems with this movie was Kevin Dillon's hair. I guess it was an 80's thing. The ending wasen't as good as I thought it could have been. Good enough anyways.I feel that The Blob had some of the best special effects of the 80's and without fancy CGI. Very inventive deaths. Some of the effects were a little cheesy but it really added to the fun feel.I think they should make either another remake with today's effects or a straight out sequel. I'd like to see what can be done with Blob effects these days. (They did kind of open it up for a sequel).One of the best Sci-Fi/Horror/Comedy films of the 80's.Enjoy.,The Blob
130,Andy B-8,A remake that's better,8,25 August 1999,"This, along with The Thing, is probably one of the few remakes that is better than the original film.This is all mainly due to those yucky special-effects.  The scene where the guy is pulled head-first down the sink plug-hole is a stand out.  There are also characters that you would have thought wouldn't get ""blobbed"" - but do.It's a movie that started out as fifties B-movie and I suppose this version had no aspirations to be anything but the same - but it pulls off some great action sequences and some witty dialogue - ""Great, we killed the strawberry jam."".",The Blob

Shawnee Smith is the miss priss who has to unite with Dillon in order to save their stunted town from certain absorbing annihilation at the..well it has no hands so I guess at the blob of the Blob. Joe Seneca shows up as the insidious scientist who knows more than he's letting on. The remake ups the gore ante and death scenes of course but it somehow staves off, for the most part the cheese factor. Smith does get quite whiny and annoying and her late charge as the heroine is pretty laughable but Dillon, Seneca and your favorite toxic waste meltdown man Paul McCrane make up for it.

The Blob embraces its low budget origins, but gives it a sleek, big budget sheen not afforded a lot of movies and Russell uses his large budget carefully and cleverly.Unlike a lot of horror movies, there's more character development and realistic human interactions in this film and the whole project is well cast. Kevin Dillon broods with the best of them as the town's rebel with a cause and Shawnee Smith is equal parts girl next door and action heroine. Veteran actors like Candy Clark even get a chance to shine. Because of this attention to character, the rather silly threat becomes genuinely terrifying.The special effects are just as excellent as the acting with several nasty, showstopping moments that'll have you bolting for your barf bags.The Blob is a fine example of a remake done right.",The Blob

135,Jorgosch,Well aged horror,7,27 April 2012,"I re-watched this movie tonight after 15 years and was surprised how well it holds up. The script moves at a furious pace and is often a step ahead of the viewer, giving him two shocks while he is still anticipating the first one (""The sheriff has gone to the diner""). There's lots of gore, sure, but also a fair amount of tongue-in-cheek which rather servers to throw the viewer off balance instead of granting him relief.The acting is consistent throughout, and the money for special effects is well spent. The camera does not linger to show sfx shortcomings, rather some ingenious mixes are used to overcome them, like the strobe light in the movie theatre to hide the copy/paste blob. In short, the director does everything right and the movie feels like an A-movie more often than not. The biggest shortcoming IMHO is the soundtrack. With an orchestral soundtrack - I'm thinking Jerry Goldsmith - this would have become a horror classic. As it is, The Blob is great popcorn theatre that will glue you to your seat - pun intended.",The Blob
136,atomicpunk40,20 years later The Blob still is one of the better remakes from the 80's,8,5 August 2008,"Yes this review is written on August 5, 2008...20 years ago to the day that the remake of The Blob was unleashed to audiences. And it was... and still is... one of the better creature feature remakes. It was a damn shame the flick bombed at the box office.Note - I will spoil a little of the end, but not much.During the 1980's it seemed like a whole slew of remakes of sci-fi and horror classics from the 50's were being put on the screen. You had the good (The Fly, The Thing), and you had the lousy (Invaders From Mars). The Blob was one of the better ones and it is a shame it went nowhere at the at the box office and only somewhat better on home video because it deserves to be watched. This time everybody's favorite slimeball from space invaders a small Colorado ski town (where it was a small town in New England in the original). Cute-as-a-button cheerleader Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith) and the town troublemaker Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillion in a role that firmly makes him as good an actor as his older bro Matt) are the ones who go up against the Blob and try to stop it.Of course we do have some problems here gang. The original Blob was red.. a sicking BLOOD red. That was one of the reasons it was so scary. Here Mr. Blob is a pinkish-purple. Not frighting. Also the original was a silent predator. You didn't know it was there until you turned around and there it was. This version throws things around, splashes water, and... jinkees... screams! Yes it screams. And I didn't know it even had vocal cords! I'm sorry but silence is golden when it comes to the Blob.On the positive side are two great performances by the two leads and even if it is a bit too much to take Smith's transformation from a peppy cheerleader to an ass-kicking teenage girl version of Rambo. And yes there are the gross out moments. You couldn't have a flick like this without them and this one gives you the goods.Unfortunately we are left with one of those it's-not-over-yet-folks kind of endings. You know what I'm talking about. The monster finally gets it's butt kicked and we think after all the trouble it has caused it has gotten what it deserved and that's that...BUT WAIT! The last shot shows the villain is still alive in one way or another and ready to go out and cause more fun filled chaos. In other words... sequel! What is really irritating with this is that most of the movies that put on this kind of ending usually don't go anywhere financial-wise and therefore we never do see that sequel and we are just left with a somewhat half-opened ending that will never be resolved. And director Chuck Russell allowed The Blob to commit this sin... and this is as much of a spoiler as you will get from me. Just what does Russell do? You'll just have to watch the flick to find out! Knowing the rotten performance that The Blob delivered at the box office we know we will never see The Blob 2. But maybe that's a good thing - no Blob 2 - because with this one just a single trip was very satisfying enough, thank you.So go out and grab a copy. You'll get get caught in it's slimy grip and enjoy every minute it. Happy Birthday, Blob!",The Blob

Most of the time the original is always better than the remake. This is one of the few exceptions. This is movie is better than the original in many ways. First of all the blob is faster, deadlier and overall more badass than the original. The gore and special effects are also extremely well done, Especially for an 80's movie. Another great thing about his movie is that it breaks a lot of horror movie rules like killing the hero early in the movie or killing little kids. This what sets this movie apart from all the others. This is definitely one of the best horror movie remakes of all time. Although due to the extremely large amounts of gore and violence, I wouldn't recommend it to any one under 16.

138,khaosjr,If you're gonna advertise a mucho-grit-and-valor heroine...Let her BE one!,7,31 March 2005,"I've always felt sorry for Shawnee Smith, since many of the movies that she's starred in don't do nearly as much for her as she does for them. Examples include: CRIME OF INNOCENCE, which promised to be ""Midnight Express"" for teens (with Shawnee in the Brad Davis role), and could well have been just that if the ending hadn't been so unbelievably tame (she accepts a settlement, which lets the bad guys off scott-free); DESPERATE HOURS, which just doesn't give her much to do. (Granted, director Michael Cimino was a square peg in a round hole on this one...in fact, the movie cries for a forced-Russian-Roulette sequence by the fugitives against the family members.) And then there's THE BLOB. For all the publicity on how feisty and plucky her character is, Shawnee is upstaged mercilessly with Kevin Dillon. (We don't even learn what's behind his change of heart, or why he comes back to town instead of using the opportunity to bail!) Let's face it: watching ""Meg Penny"" get chased through the streets AND a half-flooded sewer, cornered at the Town Hall, and (clumsily) snag her boot on a snow-maker that's about to explode...It would all be great fun if she were allowed to save herself via her wits and/or adrenaline. But NOOO...The producers have ""Brian Flagg"" (almost magically) pop in at the last minute to save her you-know-what. And it gets worse: after hearing and reading what we know about ""Meg,"" you'd think Shawnee would at least be given a kid brother who seemed worth risking her neck for. Yet ""Kevin Penny"" is a major complainer and troublemaker, not nearly as funny or as smart as he rates himself. And when trapped by *El Blobo* in the Town Hall near this movie's end...well, let's just say he's no Will Robinson.MORAL: Producers, the more effort and time you spend advertising a young and beautiful heroine, the higher your audience's expectations will be for said heroine. They won't just want to see her; they'll want to see her *tapped* in terms of her potential. So if you eclipse her under fire with a male counterpart, and/or saddle her with an irritating younger sib, the audience will *not* thank you for it.(For additional proof of this, check out Bridgette Wilson's career; many of her ""key supporting roles"" have proved to be little more than glorified cameos. Moreover, she has a penchant for doing all her own stunts in action movies...yet she keeps getting demoted to ""damsel-in-distress,"" if not a living, breathing *prop!* It's a major cheat, both for her *and* for us.)",The Blob
139,KillMe666,Terror Has No Shape!,10,12 October 2001,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe this is the second-best remake of any horror film ever (the winner is most certainly John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing from Another World'), this is down to the fact that the special effects are amazing (and sick), the dark humour is amusing and quite frankly my dears I thought the original was dull, McQueen excused.For those that have been living in a dark, damp hole for most of their lives (I apologize if you have been) the film involves a man-made organism that was meant for chemical warfare but went wrong somehow so they shot it off into space, well guess what - it returns! The blob is discovered by the horror movie genre's typical 'disposable tramp guy' who foolishly pokes the organism with a stick (When will they learn eh? Never poke a creature from outer-space with a stick!). The blob, understandably annoyed by this attaches itself to the tramps arm, which starts to dissolve - yeesh. The dying tramp is then found by the stars of the film - a young rebel along with a very annoying girl, they take the tramp to hospital where the blob has time to digest the unfortunate old guy and escape.The blob continues to digest many people along the way in spectacularly sick fashion, growing with each kill. Eventually the 'government guys' come to capture 'their' blob who by this time is enormous in size, the man in charge is a complete tool who doesn't give a damn about the towns people and causes many deaths trying to keep their operation a secret for as long as possible until the rebel eventually gets the police to believe his story. By this time though, the blob is so big the government guys cannot keep control of it, and end up getting picked off as well, so it is up to the rebel and his new found girlfriend to stop the slimy one. Underneath all the special effects you have your typical monster movie - a creature that picks people off one by one (or in some cases loads at a time!), cheesy B-movie acting, disbelieving authorities, the typical romance, and the bad guys who always get their just desserts.But who cares?

It would be good to see some bonus features as well as some remastering, they could surely Polish up some of the bad green screen moments.

The blog is a really amazing practical effect that unlike anything you see today. This is a perfect movie to watch a rainy afternoon on Halloween night. It's an amazing movie that really shows how amazing 1980s action movies are. Unlike other 1980s movies this movie has very little sexism or promotion of the rape culture. Also there's a major twists at the beginning when one of the main characters is immediately killed by The Blob.

It is blatantly obvious that they were trying their hardest to turn this remake, of a not great film anyway, into a actual horrific teen horror movie. No. The premise is just to stupid. A blob?!? Please. The only way it would work was if they turned it into a horror comedy. They didn't try to but it ended up that way anyway. There's this one scene that just made me crack up so much. The bit when an unsuspecting teen sticks his hand down a sleeping woman's top (on purpose, obviously) and the blob comes out and... Well... Does whatever a blob does?! Anyway, if you know what your gonna get and don't mind it, then it's well worth a watch. It's a horror comedy that doesn't know it yet manages to still be a great horror comedy. Besides the crappy practical effects, this film works. Not how it's meant to but it does. Don't go expecting an ending like Godzilla, but it is reasonably good when the blob starts squishing people.

There are bucketloads of gore and the bodies of victims are contorted into grotesque shapes. It's disgusting and beautiful at the same time.The sheer brutality of this film shouldn't be underestimated.

This movie gets it right on nearly every level: great characters, good F/X, and creative death scenes. There's not much more you could want from a science fiction horror movie.I loved Shawnee Smith as the main heroine, Meg. She wasn't just some screaming, whimpering ""final girl"" content with being the victim. She was more like Ellen Ripley in that she took her life into her own hands, picked up a gun, and decided to kick some extraterrestrial ass.Some of the death scenes in this movie are truly memorable and original. One poor victim gets pulled down a drain, face first.There are also many great action sequences that will have you cheering and on the edge of your seat.I highly recommend this movie for anyone tired of the crap remakes being shoveled out these days.

The most notable ones are the following: 1) Vicki gets her face sucked in 2) Janitor at the diner gets pulled into the sink drain 3) The deputy gets folded back in half - head to ankle - and pulled through the bookcase.I enjoyed the development of Brian as the rebellious selfish teen who ends up saving the town. The scene at the beginning with the bike over bridge paid off later in the movie when he tries to escape the scientists.I didn't like the plot-holes. As we see in the movie theater and the final scene, the Blob can swallow numerous people at one time, grab them with long tentacles, crawls through sewers, and seems to go after the nearest living organism to it. But in the hospital scene, after it kills Paul, Meg runs into the room, tries to pull Paul out of the thing, she gets knocked unconscious in the same room and you would think that she's screwed. Yet in the very next scene you see Meg outside with her parents and the cops trying to explain what happened – without any explanation of why the Blob didn't kill her. In the sewer, Meg and her brother are clearly within reach of the Blob when they are climbing up the pipe, but it doesn't grab them. At the end of the film, when Brian gets out of the truck and helps Meg untangle her foot from the ice tank, he clearly has to run past the Blob to get from the truck to the tank, yet the Blob doesn't grab him.There's no explanation for why the Blob would then go from the hospital without killing the remaining staff and patients inside the hospital, end up outside of town in the middle of nowhere to kill the 2 teenagers in the car, and then decide to go back into town through the sewers into the movie diner. It would make more sense if the Blob would just go from room to room in the hospital killing people and then move on to the next building or out in the middle of the street. It was ridiculous how the government scientists are the ones who created the organism, they should know its strengths and weaknesses, they keep shooting bullets at it and blowing it up (one just happens to be carrying around a rocket launcher in the sewer), yet they didn't know to contain the Blob by freezing it.When I first saw this movie as a child, it scared me. Now looking at this film again as an adult, it's more comical than frightening. The Blob is not a good flick at all, but some of the kills were funny and memorable.",The Blob

152,kevinbatek,An Oooey Gooey Good Reimagining!,7,13 August 2021,"""It crawls! It creeps! It eats you alive!!"" These were the words to describe the older 1950's Blob, and are also the perfect words to describe this new creepy 1980's version too! But viewers beware...this Blob is 2.0!!When a large pink colored meteor crashes somewhere on Earth, an unsuspecting and curious man pokes inside with a stick, and ends up pulling out an oooey gooey monster, with an appetite for just about anything! After attaching itself to this man, and slowly, surely, and painfully feasting on his flesh, blood, and bones, the sticky creature grows in size, and slithers towards the doomed little town, devouring anything, and anyone it can smother itself onto! The bravery of a high school boy and girl may just be the only hope to outwit and defeat this hungry, unfeeling gelatinous mass!All of the special effects are incredibly effective and gross! Especially when a doomed moviegoer looks up, and sees another body looking down at him, almost completely assimilated by the creature! While the older 50's Blob appeared to just slowly take its time while sliding around, just slowly smothering, covering, and digesting its prey, this 80's Blob is way smarter! So smart, it makes numerous tentacles and other appendages to make a grab for its prey, as is proven in a diner kitchen, when a cook is suddenly pulled and stuffed all the way down a drain!Shawnee Smith, and Kevin Dillon are both incredible in their roles as the two main characters, Brian and Meg. Between them both however, Shawnee was my personal favorite! Her level of bravery is absolutely amazing! I loved watching her save her younger siblings, and fearlessly battle the blob, luring it into a trap she made.For those who may be introduced to this new version of an older movie, I recommend it! The 1980 Blob will creep, and gross you out for sure!",The Blob
153,tcbdeo,"Very Well-Written, Pay Attention!",8,30 June 2015,"Nothing on screen in The Blob is ever independent: it always relates to some other part of the film. The best example is of the priest who is judgmental of others. Particular attention is paid to him walking home and dropping his bottle of alcohol, a show of him being hypocritical. He is shown, early on, the take a sample of the crystal blob. At The Blob's end, the priest has embraced his evil nature, taking advantage of the weak-minded through religion and at the same time holding the key to the apocalypse. The Blob's ending, then, is provided for: not some curve ball out of nowhere intended to shock the viewer. There is even another subtle detail. The priest is one of the first characters shown in the film, standing in the bleachers of the football game.The method of defeating the blob is introduced in the first few minutes of the film: the snow machine. Deaths are even hinted at through dialogue before they occur: Flagg asks if he is a 'broken man' to Deputy Briggs; forty minutes later, Briggs is broken in half. Nothing in The Blob goes to waste.Why is The Blob's rating only 6.3? Because people don't pay attention to good writing. The rating is only that high because people cannot ignore the film's groundbreaking special effects (which have yet to be outdone, twenty years later).Give The Blob another chance, preferably with the subtitles on! You will be pleasantly surprised at just how good it really is! And lament! For the up and coming remake is bound to be half-assedly written and the digi-blob will look like stiff puke.",The Blob
154,communistgodzilla,Beware! The Remake!,7,28 July 2005,"The old Steve McQueen 'classic' gets a full-on '80s-style horror makeover, and the end result is pretty decent, especially if you're a horror fan.Having not seen the original movie, I don't how faithful this 'Blob' remake is, but the premise is the same: a vile, shapeless alien life form crashes to earth, and proceeds to eat everyone in sight, getting bigger and bigger as it goes along. The military is called in to stop the menace, but are ineffective; luckily the small town of Arborville has some plucky, rebellious teenagers around to save the day.Seeing as how this movie was made with modern technology, the special effects in 'The Blob' are much more advanced than they were in the original flick, and this leads to some fairly startling gross-out sequences. The creature is much faster and deadlier than the original monster, although it does look fake at times. The titular beast is fairly nasty too, and has a habit of eating characters you'd expect to survive a movie like this, which helps keep things a bit unpredictable; the film-makers show some guts, as not even kids are spared the wrath of the Blob. The Blob may have even eaten a dog or two, but I can't be certain about that.In between the numerous special effects sequences, the story manages to stay fairly interesting, albeit a bit predictable, especially if you've seen a lot of horror films. The origin of the creature has a bit of twist to it, which is nice. Still, people won't be watching 'The Blob' for the gripping story, but rather for the scenes where the Blob goes to town, and the movie doesn't disappoint here. Highlight sequences include a Blob rampage in a crowded movie theater, an eventful hospital stay where the Blob performs drastic, life-altering surgery on a couple of folks, and a bit at a diner that features a great - and surprising - death scene.'The Blob' was overlooked in theaters when originally released, but thanks to home video, horror fans can now check it out from the comfort of their own couch. While not as good as the '80s horror remakes of 'The Thing' and 'The Fly', 'The Blob' holds its own. The final scene even sets up a sequel! You can't get much more '80s than that.",The Blob
155,Foolish,Great Remake / Great B-Movie,9,20 January 2000,"Very seldom is a remake superior to the original.  This wonderful B-Movie is an exception. The original film was destined to be forgotten or remade. Thankfully, Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont (The Green Mile) brought just the right mix of camp, cliche and excitement to their version.  The real surprise is just how good it really is.If you like quality B-Movies, then you'll enjoy this one.  It's fun from start to finish, and the effects are great.  It's almost like you're watching a John Carpenter film (and I mean that as praise)!  Not a classic, but worth a look.  Above average for the genre.",The Blob

157,cls0680,Good horror film from the 80's,7,4 November 2015,"In a time when so many ""horror"" films had no story, no point, bad acting, and the same rehashed ""slasher"" villains AND rehashed party teen victims, The Blob was definitely a stand out GOOD horror movie.I'll be honest, I've never seen the old original, so I have no clue how similar or not they are. But I can compare them to similar movies of the 80's and this one is much smarter. There is an intriguing story to it, some decent acting, a couple of well-timed funny moments, thought-out characters, and the ""gore"" level mixed in with simple tasks we all do and take for granted make it a pretty fun watch. I never stick my hand in a sink drain without thinking of this movie! For the time, the effects were also not too bad. Some bad green screen here and there and a couple of wacky things that were probably scary at the time, but for the most part they were believable and scary, and definitely gross.The ending - or the finale anyway - is the worst part. I never really swallowed the solution as believable. Not the idea of the solution, but the execution of it.As far as 80's horror films go, this one is one to see.",The Blob
158,keef7474,Chuck Russell remade a Horror classic with a lot more grunt and great effects,7,12 August 2008,Chuck Russell's 1988 remake of the 'Blob' is a very good remake from the original. The mix of Sci Fi and Horror worked out well in the film. A contributing factor to the terror in this film is the blob has no form which creates 'a sense of unease and suspense' in the film for the people in the film cannot predict it's behavior or its shape. (There is no where really to hide) I enjoyed the film very much as I enjoy Horror. The suspense and build up in the film works well and It seems to flow very well. Also there is a sense of empathy for the main characters Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith which they play out their parts well. Enjoyable Horror a must see.,The Blob

160,Robin_Yutani,"Great effects, but that's about it.",6,1 April 2019,"I haven't seen the original The Blob (1958), so this review doesn't have a bias towards its being a remake.
**Positive Points**
The main highlight of this film is the special effects, which are all very good for the most part. It's bloody, disturbing, and has the balls to kill one of the kid characters which, in my opinion, is commendable. The Shawnee Smith gives what is easily the best performance in the film, but quite a bit of the supporting cast does a good job as well.
**Negative Points**
Until the government people show up, there's almost nothing driving the story. Scenes just start and stop. The guy playing Flagg wasn't a bad actor, but I would've done another take for him a few times. The pacing is lightning fast at some parts or absolute molasses at others. I just watched this last night and was paying attention the whole time, but I barely remember anything else.
**Final Verdict**
While the scenes with the Blob are quite special and fun to watch, you have to get through some forgetful character stuff first. At least it doesn't overstep its bounds and stays under an hour and 45 mins. It's a short fun movie but I won't be returning any time soon.

163,vladanzivanovic,A Brand New Love,10,13 March 2019,"Picked this up on Blu-ray from Umbrella Entertainment. A remake that defines the 80's Horror/Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre. Better than the original, and highly underrated.The effects are great, the gore, the acting is solid with a great choice of casting with very likeable characters with excellent chemistry, humour is also well timed, just great pacing. An awesome soundtrack as well, with the 80's power band Alien and a couple of their better songs in the mix, and one at the end credits ""Band New Love"".Won't go into detail with spoilers, but if you are on the fence with the Blu-ray release? Then I would suggest to just pick up ASAP, sit back and enjoy this definitive release from Umbrella Entertainment.Picture and sound are great, probably the best version you will find at a bargain price, along with the German media book release ""Der Blob"". With either version you decide to get, you cannot go wrong.Love this movie through and through! A real gem, very original and one of the best.",The Blob

First of all the special effects were great especially for an 80's horror movie. needless to say there is definitely plenty of gore also in this movie. The cast was decent enough, i feel like even though the acting was a little all over the place they still did good with what they had. And oh boy the blob looked very awesome!! especially once the blob got to the size of a building now that is terrifying......... The kills I thought were also done very well, my favorite was when the head CDC guy finally got a taste of his own medicine and got sucked into the sewer by the blob. People may rant how bad this movie is but if your a true horror fan this movie will hold a special place in your heart for all horror fanatics. I give 7/10 stars!",The Blob

169,dpmaurer2,double plus good,10,4 December 2001,"a rare gem, indeed: a horror film that is actually horrifying. 'the blob' breaks most of the cardinal rules of cinema ('thou shalt not kill people we like, nor the innocent, nor children'), leaving the viewer adrift, with no safe place to go and no idea what is going to happen next. it makes us genuinely like and care about the characters as if they are people we actually know, then systematically murders them in truly terrible ways, all before our disbelieving eyes.people thought hitchcock was crazy for killing his main character in 'psycho' just a few brief moments into the film, but it stands as a classic today because he made the right decision to truly frighten his audience. 'the blob' is every bit as well crafted, and makes all the right decisions.tight, well-crafted direction. camera movements that help create, magnify and unleash terror. a script that is almost impossibly good, with believable characters that drive the film from the first scene. truly horrific fx that stand the test of time.what you're left with after watching 'the blob' is something you probably haven't experienced in a very long while: insomnia. to watch this film is to be reminded of the truths we do anything and everything to avoid facing: people we like and love will die, without reason - lovers, children, parents, friends - some in truly terrible ways, and nothing we can do - not going to church every day, not being a good person, not abstaining from one thing or another or anything else - can protect us from it.maybe that's why we still need god, at this late date in our history: to keep the truth at bay and give us hope.in its final moments, 'the blob' even takes that away.",The Blob
