0,MartinHafer,"as long as you aren't looking for the Frankenstein story by Mary Shelley, you will be very happy",9,30 March 2006,"I made the mistake of reading the original Mary Shelley version of Frankenstein almost 20 years ago. I say unfortunate, because I then realized that none of the movies have ever come close to approaching the greatness of the novel. Most, such as this famous Universal monster movie, focus too much on the monster and not enough on the moral issues that elevated the novel to greatness. In other words, Shelley's book wasn't focused on the monster as much as how awful and cowardly the doctor was for creating this being and then abandoning it. BUT, if you can look past this, the film is great fun.Colin Clive starred as the doctor in this and the sequel, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. While he certainly wasn't a great actor (he had a very limited range--or at least it appears that way based on the roles he played), he was just right to play a slightly insane and extremely focused ""mad scientist"". Yes his acting was over-the-top, but for this film it was necessary.Boris Karloff played the monster. The role was apparently originally offered to Bela Lugosi (who had just made a name for himself playing Dracula), but he foolishly turned down the role. Karloff made the most of it and did a great job of infusing life and humanity into a mostly mute monster.The movie is appropriately creepy--with lots of spider webs, fog and other scenery guaranteed to set the mood. A beautiful film to look at and unjustly seen by some as just a kids' movie. See it and experience one of the best Universal had to offer.The only misgiving I have at all about giving this wonderful movie a 10 is that some of the other actors really weren't great. A couple of the minor actors in particular clearly misread their lines yet the director, James Whale, did not re-shoot the scenes. An odd little mistake in an otherwise wonderful film.",Frankenstein
1,TheLittleSongbird,Shocking and enthralling interpretation of the classic tale,10,1 May 2010,"There have been complaints that Frankenstein is dated. Personally I don't find that, it isn't the most sumptuous of all films, but it is still a wonderful film, that is still shocking and enthralling to me. The Gothic set design is very imaginative, helped by the beautiful cinematography with suitably bizarre camera angles, and the music score is haunting, melancholy and atmospheric. James Whale's direction is also very impressive, it is very focused and innovative. The story is without a doubt a classic, tense, moody and melancholic, and the Monster itself is just a masterful creation. The cast are superb, Colin Clive is very good as the eccentric Henry Frankenstein, while Mae Clarke is an alluring and sympathetic Elizabeth. There is no doubt in my mind though that Boris Karloff gave the best performance, not only that but the definitive portrayal of the monster. He is almost unrecognisable and scary with his make up, and while he was scary with the towering presence and the frightening look in his eyes, his monster is also somewhat touching, particularly when he reaches up to grasp a ray of sunlight. Overall, shocking, enthralling and just wonderful. ""It's Alive!"" 10/10 Bethany Cox",Frankenstein
2,bkoganbing,Slaughter of the Innocents,10,25 January 2008,"Of all the great Universal horror classics and the legendary monsters who came from them by far the one with the most popular appeal has been Frankenstein. Baron Henry Frankenstein and his creature, the result of him probing into the mysteries of life itself, arouse both horror and sadness at the same time.Colin Clive is the scientist nobleman who's not been as involved as he should be considering he's about to get married to Mae Clarke. She and best friend John Boles are concerned about him, spending days at a time in that laboratory he has in an abandoned old mill. They ought to be concerned, they find him claiming he can create life out a lot of old body parts. He claims also to have discovered the electrical ray that created life itself on this planet.What he creates is played by Boris Karloff in the film that launched his career in the horror genre. With nothing but grunts and spastic movements Karloff captures the essence of new life with the innocence of a newborn and the strength of Atlas.That's the key to the monster's character and why we feel such pity for him. If newborn babies had his power, they'd be as the monster was, striking out at what they don't understand or who does not give them instantly what they want. The monster in fact is a newborn creature and it's when he kills little Marilyn Harris we know he has to be destroyed.Coming over from that other Universal horror classic Dracula are Dwight Frye who plays the hunchback Fritz, Clive's assistant who pays dearly for taunting the monster and Edward Van Sloan who is Clive's professorial mentor. Sadly Van Sloan does not handle the creature quite as well as he does Bela Lugosi.Though Frankenstein and the other Universal horror classics have taken quite a beating from first Abbott&Costello, then the gorier Hammer films recreations and finally from Mel Brooks, Frankenstein still has the power to entertain and to fascinate.",Frankenstein
3,Leofwine_draca,Universal classic - all it lacks is a score,9,19 July 2016,"My feelings were mixed before I saw this one. On one hand, it's one of the most famous horror films ever (who doesn't know what Karloff's Monster looks like?) but on the other hand, I wasn't too keen on Lugosi's Dracula made at the same time (although after a second viewing it's grown on me...). However, I was greatly pleased with this film, a lot better than its companion piece, seeing as it contains more action, better characterisations, better everything really. The only thing the film lacks is the presence of Bela Lugosi, who despite his many detractors was always great value for money.It more than makes up for his absence, however, with the presence of newcomer Boris Karloff, who more than acquits himself in the role and was good enough to become one of the biggest horror movie stars ever in the history of cinema. He would continue his role in horror films for more than thirty years afterwards, up until his death, and really this is the performance that kick-started his floundering career. Karloff evokes sympathy and deeply unsettling horror. It would have been easy to keep the monster as a bland-faced brute but Karloff manages to bring a deep level of understanding for the misunderstood creature, and he manages to do this under a ton of makeup. Like Lee after him, he fleshes out his monster, a very difficult task with which few have succeeded (Glenn Strange never managed to do this).The film has a great Gothic ambiance. It kicks off in the middle of a graveyard, and what better place is there to start a film? With the broken crosses everywhere and the ever present statue of death hovering in the background, you know you're in for a good time. The atmosphere of this opening scene is later recaptured in the famed creation scene, set in a ruined castle on a hill. The atmosphere of these old classics is really something to behold, and I fear that it can never be totally recaptured - there was none of it in the recent adaptation, MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN.Along with this we have some brilliant acting from Colin Clive (who reached the peak of his manic performance when screaming ""It's alive, it's alive!""). It's probably fair to say that Clive's definitive performance was the basis for many more mad scientists in films in the 1950s. Along with Clive and Karloff, Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan from Dracula are along for the ride, Frye being memorable as the hunchbacked assistant (another defining role) and Sloan excelling himself as the stern but kindly professor. Mae Clarke also adds a pretty face to the cast list, but as in many of these films is not given much to do, being the token love interest all she needs to do is scream and faint.Karloff's makeup for his role is also definitive, it is amazing that over sixty years later practically everyone in the western world still remembers his flat head and the bolts from his neck. This film is a true classic in the genre and it's easy to say why. The only thing I would say the film lacks is music, which is sorely missed especially in the dramatic scenes, but there is so much going on (unlike in Dracula) that it is never missed too much. Well worth watching, and it goes without saying that if you are a true horror fan then sooner or later you must see this film.",Frankenstein
4,SnoopyStyle,Boris Karloff terrific,8,4 July 2015,"Henry Frankenstein is a doctor obsessed with bringing back the dead. He needs a brain and his assistant Fritz steals one from a murderous criminal. His fiancée Elizabeth is concerned. Along with her friend Victor Moritz and Henry's mentor Dr. Waldman, they witness the creation of the monster. The monster kills Fritz who was tormenting him with a torch. Frankenstein and Waldman manage to sedate the monster. While Frankenstein is away to marry Elizabeth, the monster wakes up and kills Waldman. He escapes and accidentally kills little Maria. Maria's father riles up a mob to hunt down the monster.This is a classic monster horror. The acting is functional with the exception of Boris Karloff. He creates a monster that is copied and parodied to infinity. The mob is scary and the windmill is a great set piece. It all comes down to the monster and the movie jumps off the screen when he's there. He's a magnetic presence.",Frankenstein
5,Hitchcoc,A Staple of Filmdom,9,13 May 1999,"The original Frankenstein must have been something when first seen. The wonderful instant atmosphere--the foggy graveyard, the two slinking figures waiting for the funeral to end, looking for bodies. Karloff, for the first time, actually interpreting the role, using his expressive face and those enormous hands, the appeal to the world to accept his being. Of course, it is entirely removed from the classic book (who says it has to follow the book, an entirely different medium) where the creature is brought to life by some secret means then goes on to become sentient, philosophical, and vengeful. Still, this hulking reanimation is trying to fit in but can't control his base impulses. His very size is his enemy. The carelessness of Fritz sets everything in motion--had he not panicked we might have had an Albert Schweitzer ""monster"" running through the countryside doing good deeds. Now there's a horror movie!I have grown to love this film, especially its most famous scenes. The bringing of life, using lightning, Colin Clive, almost frothing at the mouth, screaming ""It's alive, it's alive,"" the death of the little girl through a childlike misunderstanding, the encounter with the blind man, and of course, the scene at the windmill, the villagers running with their torches. By the way, where did they get all those torches? Unlike the first reviewer, I urge you to see this film, not because of its lack of faithfulness to the novel, but because of its captivating portrayal of horror. I wish I could have been in a theater in the 30's and seen Edward Van Sloan announce to us that we were about to be terrified. What a moment!",Frankenstein
6,mark.waltz,Monsters lead such interesting lives....,10,31 May 2013,"From Herman Munster to Mel Brooks to a Tim Burton pooch, this beloved creature of Mary Shelley's imagination has had more lives than Shirley MacLaine. He's survived floods, quicksand and fires, and even adult videos have utilized his legend. But in this original version, what the monster remains today was created, and that is not only thanks to Ms. Shelley, but the artistic vision of its director James Whale and the actor who played the unnamed monster, Boris Karloff. So break out your old video copy or even better, the newer DVD collection of most of the series, almost a serial (or ""Dark Shadows"" like soap opera) in its continuity.Universal followed up its enormously popular ""Dracula"" with its tale of the flat-topped, green-skinned mass of muscle that only kills because that's what classic movie monsters do, its own heart breaking when he accidentally drowns a little girl in one of the most notorious death scenes in movie history. It's not all horrific, some humor put into the Igor predecessor who drops the good brain he has been sent to steal when confronted by a hanging skeleton and replaces it with what Mel Brooks would later refer to as belonging to ""Abby Normal"".Like many of the follow-ups, the film utilizes an almost silent movie art direction, obviously influenced by German impressionism and films like ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and ""Nosferatu"". There's some truly frightening moments, especially with Karloff stalking the film's fragile heroine (Mae Clarke) who would need something more than grapefruit (utilized on her in the same year's ""The Public Enemy"") to get rid of this brute. Colin Clive truly steals acting honors here, swinging between rationality and absolute madness in his desire to cross God and go into territories that threaten to doom his soul. Veteran romantic lead John Boles (""Craig's Wife"", ""Stella Dallas"") is wasted as Clive's concerned pal, but Dwight Frye is a riotous delight as the Igor-like assistant who pays dearly for messing with things outside his sensibilities as a human being.",Frankenstein
7,classicsoncall,"""I made him with these hands, and with these hands I'll destroy him.""",9,25 October 2006,"Boris Karloff's first appearance as the Creature is truly striking, done with a facial close up that in it's time must have shocked and horrified. I read once that Mae Clarke was so scared of Karloff in his monster disguise that they worked out a little gimmick between themselves. Whenever they appeared in a scene together, Karloff would wiggle his pinkie finger as a signal to his co-star that he was thinking of her, thus helping her realize that he wasn't really a monster.If you follow the story carefully, there are some plot points that upon careful analysis just don't make sense. Wouldn't Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) have had a mild interest in reading the label on the beaker that contained the 'abnormal brain'? Why would he ever have dressed in a suit and tie in that dungeon of a castle? Why wasn't anyone who was present express amazement when the creature first moved his hand? How did the monster get into the Frankenstein home without being seen while the whole town was turning out for the wedding?For detractors of the film, I DON'T CARE! This is the first iconic Universal Movie monster, and his presentation on the big screen for the first time is wonderful. Karloff's interpretation of the creature is magnificent, going far beyond the requirements of makeup. His stilted walk, accentuated by a forty five degree diagonal posture almost defies gravity. It appears he did everything he could to live up to the narrator's message of warning prior to the start of the story. Karloff is Frankenstein, and Frankenstein is Karloff.For it's time, and I daresay, even for today, Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory is one of the classics of film history. Floating it up to to the top of the castle tower to receive it's life giving energy directly from lightning bolts was inspired. Hearing Frankenstein's exhortation that the creature is ALIVE! has a way of burning itself into the viewer's consciousness, and remains there long after the film has ended. It's the movie's way of convincing it's viewers that Dr. Frankenstein was right when he challenges his guests to accept his dubious triumph. Is it possible to create life from the assembled remains of dead tissue? - ""Tonight you shall have your proof"".",Frankenstein
8,gavin6942,"Legendary, Plain and Simple",8,3 October 2010,"Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has devised a way of reanimating life. Using spare parts, he constructs a man, who is something of a monster (Boris Karloff). Unable to keep the creature under control, it terrorizes the village and surrounding areas...While a superior film to ""Dracula"", there is something to be said here about taking liberties. ""Dracula"" stayed more or less true to the book, whereas ""Frankenstein"" makes a number of divergences. The monster is less intelligent, the method of re-animation is more explicit, the Arctic scene is removed entirely...Great on its own, and highly memorable, this film's real contribution is to the horror world. The monster is now known as Frankenstein, we know he is brought to life by electricity, he has greenish skin and he has bolts in his neck. These all came from this film. And it is so overpowering that there is no bringing back the original concepts.Although I want to keep this review very short, I have to give credit to Dwight Frye. After playing Renfield in ""Dracula"", he came on to this film and played Fritz (the character we commonly call Igor). I don't know what it is about playing horror assistants, but Frye does it perfectly... he regretfully died at age 44.",Frankenstein
9,lee_eisenberg,it's alive and always will be,10,2 August 2005,"Having read Mary Shelley's novel sort of ruined this version for me, but ""Frankenstein"" is still great to watch. Even if it now seems pretty silly to us, I guess that it remains a good lesson about what we shouldn't try to do. Boris Karloff is great as the Monster, with Colin Clive casting an eerie presence as Dr. Henry Frankenstein, and Dwight Frye as his assistant Fritz (not Igor).I'm sure that ""It's alive!"" will remain in our vocabulary for generations to come, while everyone will remember Boris Karloff's interpretation of the monster (with Jack Pierce's makeup). But still, you should read Mary Shelley's novel just to know what the original story was (I recommend the novel over Kenneth Branagh's dry 1994 movie).",Frankenstein
10,jboothmillard,Frankenstein,10,1 July 2005,"Based on the story by Mary Shelley, this is probably the most well known of all the film adaptations, from director James Whale. Basically Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) wants to build a man made of dead bodies, so he and assistant Fritz (Dracula's Dwight Frye) steal a couple of bodies, and Fritz also steals an abnormal criminal brain (after dropping the normal one) from Frankenstein's former teacher Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan). Frankenstein has completed his construction, and he is ready to bring his creation to life, with the help of electrodes and the incoming storm (lightning). Worried for him, Henry's fiancée Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), along with best man Victor Moritz (John Boles) and Dr. Waldman go to see Frankenstein, and they too witness the experiment completion. There is movement from this creature, and a few minutes later, you see The Monster (Boris Karloff) in person. At first, it seems very slow and obedient, but it becomes apparent that it is very aggressive, and they have to lock in a cell, which after killing Fritz, he does manage to escape from. While Frankenstein tries to proceed with his wedding, the Monster is ""playing"" with a little girl, who he throws in the water thinking she will float, but in fact he drowns her, and her father joins the villagers to get the Monster. Frankenstein finds it, and it takes him to the near windmill, where Henry is thrown over the side - lucky to be alive - and it appears that the Monster is burned alive in the tower. Even with its simplicity, it is still a creepy and influential horror film, and Karloff's image is still as iconic as ever, one of the great classics of cinema. It was number 49 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""It's alive! It's alive!""), it was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 56 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 100 Years, 100 Movies. Outstanding!",Frankenstein
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Frankie Was Good In His Day, But.....",6,10 March 2007,"Just because a film is ""the original"" doesn't always mean that whatever follows automatically is going to be inferior. Regarding this one, I much prefer the 1994 ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" a very underrated adaptation.Most of the times I do agree that the original is better than the re- make, but not aways, and particularly when it comes to horror or science-fiction films. A case in point in this classic, which I re-visited on VHS in the '90s after a long hiatus. When I saw it again, I was surprised that very little of the film had the monster coming to life. Most of it centered around what happened before the culmination of Dr. Frankenstein's work. Afterward, we see the result and then the famous last scenes in which the townspeople went after the monster at night with torches.Although slower than I remembered, I still found the first half of the movie interesting. However, I think the film lacked one essential ingredient for a good ""horror movie"" - atmosphere. I saw much more of that atmosphere in ""The Bride Of Frankenstein,"" or the Dracula films - old and new, or the Val Lewton series from back in the 1940s.I will forever remember hearing Colin Clive yelling, ""It's alive!!!"" but other than that, this did not turn out to be that memorable or exciting...at least not now, over 75 years later. A lot of those '30s horror classics look too dated and are too slow. The big exception, of course, is ""King Kong,"" which has never been equaled.",Frankenstein
12,rmax304823,Hubris.,7,10 May 2015,"Best lines in the movie belong to Colin Clive, as Henry Frankenstein, after he creates the monster. ""It's ALIVE! Oh, it's alive! Get beck -- get BECK!"" I've never felt so good in my life as Henry Frankenstein feels at that moment, not even after a foot massage in an Egyptian health café.Unfortunately, Henry has stepped on the toes of God or the gods, and created life, a procedure to which the gods have the franchise. Well, it was to be expected. The novel was written by Percy Shelley's girl friend, Mary Wolstonecraft, in 1816 and the air was filled with electricity, so to speak. Science was beginning to challenge religion along a broad front, culminating in 1859 with the publication of Darwin's ""Origin of Species."" The idea was beginning to take hold that science could do anything. The notion, of course, is incomplete. Even today, almost two hundred years later, there are events that no scientist has ever been able adequately to explain. Why are cats fascinated by flushing toilets? If the universe is expanding, what the hell is it expanding INTO? Why is it that every time I put my T shirts in the dryer they come back inside out? Why is hail always the size of something else?Fritz, the hunchbacked dwarf, who was never in the novel, really screws Frankenstein's experiment up when he drops the ""normal"" brain and substitutes an ""abnormal"" brain. I liked Mel Brooks' take on this incident, when the dwarf is later asked which brain he took, and the dwarf answers, ""A normal brain. Belonged to somebody called A. B. Normal."" Fritz muddied up the story too, because the point is made that the monster is not so abnormal after all. If a little girl treats him politely and asks him to join her in throwing flowers into the lake, the creature whimpers like a puppy. Who know? If he'd been treated with more respect instead of being teased with flaming torches, he might have become a philosopher or a champion polo player.Karloff gets to snarl but not speak, and his monster doesn't merely shuffle around either. It moves quickly when it has to, and even darts from place to place. In one shot -- and I don't know how they pulled this off -- the monster leans forward until his center of gravity is a few inches in front of the tips of his shoes. He's at an acute angle from the perpendicular but he's still upright. They may have nailed his shoes to the floor.I suppose it's a happy ending since Henry Frankenstein gets to marry his girl friend, although they don't show any signs of loving each other. But there have been a number of deaths, including the little girl whom the monster mistakenly throws into the lake. Possibly Henry can break out his Van de Graaff generators and bring her back to life.The movie is short and it's really a cultural icon, so you should see it. If you don't you'll miss a lot of jokes on TV shows, and you'll get all mixed up and start calling the monster ""Frankenstein"", a mistake so gauche that it will enable you to clear a room without using a gun.",Frankenstein

14,BA_Harrison,One of Universal's finest horror classics.,9,6 May 2010,"Fans of Mary Shelley's book may dislike James Whale's Frankenstein for straying too far from its source material, many of today's viewers will no doubt find the film too slow, and as is the case with so many of the classic Universal monster movies, over-familiarity with the material—the result of nearly 80 years of endless sequels, remakes, spoofs, and homages—renders certain aspects of the film amusing rather than horrific (the now clichéd sight of a hunchbacked assistant carrying a brain in a jar or a mob of torch wielding villagers cannot help but cause a snigger).For a more balanced perspective, Frankenstein should, if possible, be viewed with a different mindset: that of a cinema-goer of 1931, for whom grave robbing, man-made monsters, and incredible, electricity-filled laboratories capable of bringing life to the dead were enough to prove utterly terrifying (and were also a great diversion from the real-life horrors of the 'great depression'). Only when seen from this viewpoint can the real magic of the piece be truly appreciated.The creature, for example, might understandably be perceived by today's audiences as distinctly unfrightening, but look beyond the seemingly comical flat-topped-head, over-sized shoulders and platform hobnail boots, and the delicate nuances of Boris Karloff's performance will become apparent: even under Jack Pierce's iconic make-up, Karloff is able to convey a wide range of emotions—fear, anger, frustration, loneliness—all without uttering a word, and at the same time make his audience not only pity the creature and understand its child-like mentality, but also find it absolutely horrific. In contrast, Colin Clive's turn as Herr Frankenstein is deliberately over-the-top; teetering precariously on the brink of insanity, he is often almost as frightening as his creation, and perceivably more of a monster.Whale's assured direction is also worthy of high praise: he makes optimum use of impressive sets and expressionistic lighting to add immensely to the atmosphere of unease (the lab in the watchtower and the ruined windmill, in particular, are superb), and he successfully draws convincing performances from his main players, thereby avoiding the awful staginess that marred much of Tod Browning's Dracula. Some of his supporting actors are unfortunately a trifle hammy in an effort to provide brief moments of levity (Baron Frankenstein and the Burgomaster are clearly played for laughs), and a few of the painted backdrops could do with a good iron to remove the obvious wrinkles, but these minor quibbles aside, Frankenstein is a movie well deserving of its classic status.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Frankenstein
15,Quinoa1984,"Not AS great as you may have heard, but still has a classic vibe",9,24 October 2012,"James Whale and Carl Laemmle Jr's adaptation of Mary Shelly's book is scary in one respect if nothing else: the got the right Monster. Boris Karloff was, apparently, not a known actor by any real stretch, despite working in almost eighty films as a character actor and on stage for quite a while (think about how many actors today could break through at 44?) When combined with Jack Pierce's unique, strange/deranged make-up, it is quite a sight to see the man transform himself into the un-dead 'brute'. His physicality is what makes him an imposing presence, and it's not so much a scare of where he'll come from, but just seeing his face and shape and knowing what damage he can do. I have to think a little of the Hulk, despite being more about anger, had something in debt to Frankenstein's monster.And there is one truly great scene in the film, where the Monster, after escaping possible dissection by Dr. Frankenstein's mentor (this is actually a scary/cool bit where he flicks opens his eyes little by little and then attacks suddenly), and comes upon a little girl by a lake. The little girl is very sweet and understanding, not really knowing that it's a monster of the un-dead, and wants to show him some flowers and how they go on a lake. And then, seeing as he doesn't have flowers, he tosses her into the lake as well. What's shocking here are a few things to me: 1) the action itself, since it seems so sudden, and yet so inevitable, 2) that the scene was cut-out for many years, and yet, in a way, made the Monster less of a 'gray-area' sort of creature, that there *could* be the potential for understanding and human connection, but severed once he did wrong. And 3) that an audience I saw the film with today (on its one-night-re-release in theaters) thought it was funny. My how times change. The rest of the film has some spooky atmosphere of course, if nothing else cause of the tower where Frankenstein does his experiments (and the set is the Grand-daddy of all sci-fi/horror film sets where madness and science collide with electricity and gadgets and such). But there's also dated stuff to it as well, and a brief excursion to show the town in excitement and dancing, shot with a not-so-steady tracking shot, doesn't flow well. And outside of Clive, who plays the doctor, I wasn't very keen on a lot of the performances; Baron Frankenstein especially is tough to watch as he ambles about as a gruff 'Well what is the meaning of this such-and-such' sort that is tiresome after the first minute. And a very last scene where the Frankensteins are seemingly beloved again with a 'toast' is extremely bizarre and not in a way I found amusing.But so much of Frankenstein is just cool to watch, maybe just for the iconic 'It's ALIVE!"" moments, and its beginning which doesn't really waste much time with preamble about who this doctor is: right away, he goes for digging up the bod(ies) and getting to work. While a few moments have become sort of laughable, in general Frankenstein still works as one of the keystones of Universal horror, as Whale had a good eye for detail right at the start of the sound era (though one can only imagine what he could have also done in silent film, seeing as how the Monster, in this film, doesn't speak outside of grunts and ROARS). Oh, and the ending sequence at the tower is excellent, and exciting.",Frankenstein
16,JohnHowardReid,"Classic play, classic movie",10,19 November 2006,"Probably no other film except Gone With The Wind has attracted so much critical and public attention as Frankenstein. And as far as influence is concerned, this movie is the winner. I lost count after 1977, but up to that time there were at least sixty movie spin-offs. How many did GWTW generate? A handful at most. Just about all these movie spin-offs of Frankenstein are direct descendants of the 1823 stage dramatization (in Two Acts) by Richard Brinsley Peake. I looked up Peake's name on IMDb. He has not one single movie credit. Mary Shelley, on the other hand, has over fifty.Peake's adapted his stage play, Presumption or The Fate of Frankenstein, from Mrs Shelley without her knowledge (let alone her collaboration), but ultimately with her full blessing and approval. In fact, she even wrote in her diary: ""Lo and behold, I found myself famous. I was much impressed. The play seemed to excite a breathless eagerness in the audience."" Peake's play received unanimous praise. After a most successful season at London's Covent Garden, the whole company travelled to New York for a Broadway presentation in 1825. This also proved a triumph, with both critics and general theatregoers heaping particular praise on Thomas Potter Cooke who virtually stole the show with his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal of the silent monster, which Cooke played 400 times before the play finally closed. And for the next fifty years, Cooke coasted on his fame in numerous similar vehicles. Peake's play itself enjoyed countless revivals with some of the most famous actors of the day like Henry Irving playing the monster. Three of the differences between Shelley and Peake are really major: 1. In the novel, the monster not only speaks fluently, but has a most impressive vocabulary and eventually becomes quite verbose. In the play, Peake introduces a silent monster who can do no more than grunt. (Wow! So Thomas Potter Cooke, a well-known villain on the London stage in 1823, accepted a role that had no dialogue, yet played that role with such expertise, such understanding and such sympathy, he achieved instant fame)! 2. Peake gives Frankenstein a loyal, eager but not over-bright assistant named Fritz. In the novel, Frankenstein has no assistant at all. 3. The play, like this movie, features a detailed creation sequence; whereas the novel pays extremely scant attention to the actual creation of the monster. Indeed the whole episode is dismissed in a single vague paragraph! Now here's an interesting point. A friend sent me a photocopy of the theatre program for the 1927 adaptation by Peggy Webling at the Preston Theatre. This program acknowledges that Miss Webling's adaptation was based on both Shelley's 1818 novel and Peake's 1823 stage presentation! Yet, when Universal purchased the Webling play for the movies, somehow the ascription to Richard Brinsley Peake disappeared and has remained so to this very day. Finally, we come to the movie. First off, let me say it holds up remarkably well, particularly in Universal's fine DVD version which renders both Arthur Edeson's wondrous visuals and the movie's superlative sound effects in a manner that really duplicates the stunning impact of the movie's first season way back in 1931. Karloff, of course, is magnificent. His twisted, cruel, vicious portrait of a Monster who is still sympathetic despite it all, can never be dimmed by changes in acting styles or current fashions. (As is well-known, the part was first offered to Bela Lugosi who, having no knowledge of British theatre history, rejected it as soon as he discovered the role carried no dialoguea mistake that ruined his entire career and sent him quickly to Poverty Row. Karloff, on the other hand, knew of Peake's play, and more importantly he realized the Monster was actually the role of a lifetime. He not only seized it with both hands but, under Whale's gifted tutelage, brought it off superbly).Not to be outdone by the Monster, Whale cleverly cast his friend, Colin Clive, as Frankenstein. I know there are critics who regard Clive's performance as over the top, but I thought he was perfect. Clive rightly plays Frankenstein as a larger-than-life figure who refuses to allow his creation to dominate the action. After all, he is the Creator!Admittedly, John Boles makes a rather staid ""best friend"" (but after all, it's perfectly in character) and Mae Clarke could have made her heroine a bit more colorful, but the other support players led by Frederick Kerr (who renders some delightful comic relief in his role as the crotchety baron), Dwight Frye (as the hunchbacked little assistant), Marilyn Harris (as Maria, the charming little girl of the lake), Lionel Belmore (the self-important burgomaster) and of course curtain-raiser/doctor Edward Van Sloan are wholly endearing.Fortunately for the movie's present popularity, Whale's directorial technique with its meticulous attention to set dressing and special effects, plus its lavish use of dialogue close-ups interspersed with imaginatively shot and staged action material is now right back in fashion. Arthur Edeson's moodily atmospheric cinematography also enhances tension and terror, as do the heightened sound effects of this early (but definitely not dated) talkie. (One of these days, someone is going to write a book about Arthur Edeson. After all, he photographed four of the most popular movies of all time. The others on that list: All Quiet on the Western Front, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca).",Frankenstein
17,wes-connors,Of Gods and Monsters,10,7 April 2011,"Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" finally comes to life. This was more of a second-hand adaptation of the novel, but it turned out exceptionally well. What Carl Laemmle Jr. and the creepy-minded folks at Universal Pictures picked for the movie medium fit perfectly, and left room for sequels. Beginning with a funeral attended by the grim reaper himself to the climactic windmill on fire, ""Frankenstein"" is filled with astounding set decoration. It's directed and photographed with shadowy style by James Whale with Arthur Edeson.Taking cues from silent German impressionist filmmakers, Mr. Whale creates a vast landscape from a small space. With great monster makeup from Jack Pierce, brutally innocent Boris Karloff startles and shines, especially with little Marilyn Harris (as Maria). Exclaiming, ""It's Alive! It's alive!' creative Colin Clive (as Henry Frankenstein) sends up an appropriately manic performance. Presently, the film can be seen with missing parts resurrected. ""Frankenstein"" remains legendary and influential. Universal created a monster.********** Frankenstein (11/21/31) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Dwight Frye, Marilyn Harris",Frankenstein

It's over 70 years old now and it still remains the strongest, most powerful monster film ever made. This film means a lot to me, but it especially means respect ! Respect for the creators, the incredible cast ( Boris Karloff will always be the creature. Even in another 70 years ) and the special effects creators. The atmosphere hanging around this movie is absolutely amazing. The images of the dark and mysterious windmill still makes your blood pump faster. The loud and vicious thunder never cease to frighten you... You can't afford to call yourself a horror freak before watching the originals.

20,hitchcockthelegend,"Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!",9,26 October 2019,"We will always see debates about which of the original wave of Universal Monster movies is the most important. With Dracula being released just under a year before Frankenstein, that tends to give the vampire crowd a sense of justifiable cause for a trumpet fanfare. Perhaps the more pertinent question is which is the better movie? Surely the most hardened of Dracula fans have to bow their heads in acknowledgement that Frankenstein quite simply is superior on every level - even if it itself is not as good as its sequel...Narrative doesn't quite follow Mary Shelley's original source material (what a brain that lady had!), but the core essence of a tragic tale holds tight. Directing was one James Whale, who here was in his directorial infancy, he himself up for debate about greatest horror genre directors, but his masterful sense of theatrical staging, and that of the terror incarnate for the era, is sublime to the point that come 100 years after its release this will still be held up as a timeless horror classic.The thematics of the story pulse with brilliance, the advent of berserker science, the alienation and confusion flow of the creature grips and stings the heart equally. The later camp of Whale's horror ventures is mostly absent here, instead we have a dark almost miserably bleak tone, which exists right up to the end title card which brings closure after the brilliant and iconic finale has made its mark. Jack Pierce's marvelous make-up and the birth of Karloff as a genre legend seals the deal on what is without doubt one of the genre's most important films. 9/10",Frankenstein
21,Theo Robertson,A Film Of Two Halves - Both Of Them Excellent,9,30 June 2013,"It's been many many years since I first saw this film which was broadcast as a horror double bill which BBC 2 used to broadcast in the Summer . It was shown as a double bill with Tod Browning's 1931 version of Dracula and having a double bill featuring both Dracula and Frankenstein was a big event amongst my school mates . After seeing the two films we all thought Dracula was a pile of rubbish that contained less chills than a Walt Disney film but FRANKENSTEIN still held up as a horror film . I think I only saw it once after that time round about 1989 and it's not a movie that turns up on British television often . I do recall from memory that the film doesn't really take off till the monster appears so sat down earlier tonight thinking it was going to be a film of two halves - one monsterless and bland and one part monsterful That is actually how it turns out but any prejudice I had that the first half was going to be uninvolving and in need of fast forwarding to the monster scenes was quickly unfounded . The first half concentrates on Henry Frankenstein played superbly by Colin Clive and gives a compelling performance as a man driven to break the very boundaries of human taboos by bringing the dead back to life . When people talk of fictional mad scientists this is the definitive performance which turned in to a cultural meme Of course once the Monster itself appears the impact is so powerful that the intelligent and carefully built up atmosphere to this point overwhelms everything that goes before it . Karloff totally dominates the movie with his combination of horror and pathos, so much so that not only does the audience forget all about the first half of the movie but become so compelled that it becomes legend . Hands up anyone who has read the original novel by Mary Shelley ? No one ? I didn't think so but we all know what the Frankenstein monster looks like and "" Iconic "" doesn't start to do it justice FRANKENSTEIN was directed by Briton James Whale who moved to America the previous year to make use of Hollywood's superior sound technology for the war drama JOURNEY'S END and decided to stay . This also explains the why several cast members have British accents . It's very appropriate indeed that it was made by Universal Studios set up by Carl Laemmie a German immigrant . Legend has it that Laemmie named the studios after "" Universal Pipe Fittings "" advertised on a passing truck . Perhaps a more romantic myth that could be added that the studio is best remembered for its horror output and this was down to a cosmopolitan bunch of Europeans such as Whale , Karloff , Lugosi , Clive and Siodmak . When people talk of the horror films it's impossible not to be reminded of the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s and this is the film that started off that cycle which has gained universal immortality",Frankenstein
22,Hey_Sweden,It may thrill you. It may shock you. It may even horrify you.,9,25 April 2021,"Rightfully regarded as one of the top horror films of all time, this initial Universal adaptation of the legendary story has much in it that quickly became iconic. Henry Frankensteins' insane ranting, Boris Karloff's impressive performance as The Monster, Jack Pierces' incredible makeup, the overwhelming atmosphere, Frankensteins' vast array of lab equipment, etc. One will note the short running time, like the vast majority of Universal genre product during this era. In adapting the Mary Shelley story - or rather, the stage adaptation - the writers cut to the ""meat and potatoes"" of the tale. It moves forward at a breakneck pace, and truly does offer a lot of fun - even if it doesn't necessarily ""thrill"", ""shock"", or ""horrify"" modern audiences.Colin Clive is an amazing study in intensity as Henry Frankenstein, the ambitious young scientist who dares to play God by creating his own man-made being. Unfortunately, thanks to the bumbling of his hunchback assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye), the Monster ends up with the warped brain of a criminal. And yet, there is an essential childlike innocence about the Monster. Witness the memorable scene (excised for a number of years) where a little girl is drowned when the Monster attempts to ""play"" with her.The acting is on point, for the most part. John Boles just sort of takes up space as Henry's friend Victor, but Mae Clarke is luminous as Henry's worried bride-to-be Elizabeth. That wonderful character actor Edward Van Sloan is a delight as the esteemed professor Waldmann who knows that nothing good can come of Henry's activities. Frye is fun to watch as Fritz, who makes his big mistake in taunting the Monster with fire. Frederick Kerr, adding comedy relief as Henry's cranky father the Baron, Lionel Belmore, as the Burgomaster, little Marilyn Harris as the young girl Maria, and Michael Mark as Maria's father Ludwig, comprise an excellent supporting cast.Admittedly, this COULD have used a music score, as it would have added to the impact of key scenes, but there's still so much to enjoy here. Karloff in particular gets one of the more memorable entrances for a movie Monster that you're likely to see in films of this kind. James Whale does a fantastic job as director.Followed by a series of sequels, beginning with ""Bride of Frankenstein"" four years later.Not to be missed.Nine out of 10.",Frankenstein
23,Doylenf,James Whales' creation is still a spine-tingler...,7,29 October 2006,"The moment COLIN CLIVE speaks that immortal line: ""It's alive! It's alive!"" you get the kind of chill that makes watching FRANKENSTEIN such fun. Atmospherically, it ranks with the best of the old B&W Universal horror films, although today, watching it produces rather distracting visions of what Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks did with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, adhering to all the traditions of this early version of the tale. And, of course, with a lot of humor that is missing in this grim take on the story.It's Clive and DWIGHT FRYE as his helper, Fritz, that really give two of the film's most memorable performances. The secondary roles played by JOHN BOLES and MAE CLARKE make no particular impression and are merely standard stock parts. EDWARD VAN SLOAN as Dr. Waldman is effective in a lesser role.And, of course, BORIS KARLOFF is truly magnificent as the creature who, indeed, looks as though he's made from dead body parts. Even the haunted expression on his face is enough to chill. He uses his whole body to express anguish and emotion--including his arms, his hands, and his walk. All of his mad rages are extremely well handled by the consummate actor.Karloff manages to bring sympathy and pity for the creature, despite his many manic moments. The suspense builds when he escapes from his confines and all of these climactic scenes still have the power to enthrall, as he strolls through the countryside and terrifies the villagers. The scene by the water with the little girl who befriends him is particularly touching.Summing up: Still chilling after all these years thanks to masterful direction by James Whale, great sets and fine cinematography. Well worth treasuring for preserving BORIS KARLOFF's memorable role.",Frankenstein
24,preppy-3,Quite simply a masterpiece of film,10,8 December 2014,"The classic horror story of Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who makes a monster (Boris Karloff) who is mad and escapes and starts killing people. This is what a good old horror film should be. It moves quickly, is wonderfully directed by James Whale, has incredible sets, some good acting, and is (for its time) pretty violent. This was released on Christmas Eve in California and supposedly the audience was in hysterics by the end. There are accounts of people fainting in the theatre or walking out in utter disgust. The monsters accidental murder of a little girl was cut out completely (it's now back in) due to an angry backlash. It's kind of funny nowadays because this movie is pretty tame stuff. Still it is scary and pretty strong at times. This film understandably made Karloff a star. He's incredible as the creature. He has no lines of course but he has to emote through tons of makeup and a terribly heavy wardrobe. He makes you feel pity for the poor creature while you're still scared about the violence he causes. Quite simply a great film in every sense of the word.",Frankenstein

The first, when Colin Clive's Creation came to Life, He, in a rush of Madness, blurts out...""Now I know what it feels like to be God"". Originally Thunderclaps drowned out that Blasphemy. The second Scene, when the Monster is with the Little Girl and She shows Him her Flower Boats that float, when He no longer has any flowers, He picks Her up and tosses Her in the water so She too will Float. Originally, the Movie cuts the Scene just before that, and the resulting Death is implied.This is a Wonderful Gothic Film that was, with its Companion Piece, Dracula (1931), Seminal and Influential in the Genre and to this Day Iconic, both are Indelible Images in Popular Culture. James Whale only made one Better Movie and that was the Sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935) that is a Perfect Picture. The Director also made the Great Film, The Invisible Man (1933) and although that is Fantastic, His two Frankenstein Movies are better.It is Intelligent and at times the Subtlety is Clever. There is a look of utter Despair and Guilt on the Dr.'s Face when His Father, in a Wedding Toast, wishes that His Son will give Him another Generation to carry on the Family Tradition. Henry Frankenstein knows that He has already done that, Illegitimately. Karloff is Sympathetic, Terrifying, and speaks to the Audience with a Portrayal of a Frightened Newborn with Looks and Gestures that are Eerie and Unforgettable.The Cast is Marvelous and its Expressionistic Sets are Impressive.

26,poolandrews,"""I am astonishingly sane."" Classic film.",7,28 August 2006,"Frankenstein starts with Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) confiding in her friend Victor (John Boles) that she is worried about her fiancé Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), he talks of nothing but his 'experiments' & locks himself away in an old windmill to conduct them. They both decide to go & see him along with his university professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) to try & talk some sense into him. They arrive late one night, as a thunder storm rages outside Dr. Frankenstein admits that he has created a body from stitching corpses together & claims that he has discovered a way to re-animate the body, using his lab equipment & bolts of lightening Dr. Frankenstein's experiments prove to be successful & his creation (Boris Karloff) comes to life. However the monster turns out to be very violent & escapes the lab & begins to terrorise a nearby town...Directed by James Whale this is the classic Frankenstein film which all others have tried to emulate, this one set the standard & still does. Released by Universal in the same year as the just as influential Dracula both helped start a horror boom. Based on the novel by Mary Shelley the extremely effective script by Francis Edward Faragoh & Garrett Fort moves along at a nice pace & is never boring, it manages to create a fair amount of sympathy for the monster & has a good solid story that works well even today, over 75 years since it was made. It's debatable whether a better adaptation of Frankenstein has ever been made, although having said that I personally still think Flesh for Frankenstein (1974) is my favourite version of the tale.Director Whale does a terrific job here, there are some truly classic & iconic images in Frankenstein. The sets are great from the stone castle to the run down windmill to a spooky graveyard. The Frankenstein make-up by Jack Pierce is impressive & is the way everyone now envisions the Frankenstein monster to look like with a flat head, bolts through his neck & stitch work across his body. The special effects are actually pretty good including a burning mill at the end.With a supposed budget of about $291,000 Frankenstein is well made & pretty impressive to watch even today, I'd have thought a lot of time & effort went into the film. The acting was OK, Clive's Dr. Frankenstein is a touch theatrical at times but he has a certain madness that seems appropriate.Frankenstein is a great film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Obviously don't expect any explosions or CGI effects as this is a film which relies on a good story done properly. A must for horror fans & definitely worth a watch for anyone else. A sequel Bride of Frankenstein (1935) was made several years later & in my opinion is actually better than this.",Frankenstein
27,utgard14,"""One man, crazy -- three very sane spectators!""",10,2 June 2014,"My personal favorite of the classic Universal horror films. I saw this for the first time at age 14 and was hooked on classic monster movies from that point on. The story, for those of you living under a rock, is about a scientist named Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) obsessed with unlocking the secrets of life. To this end, he pieces together a body out of parts taken from corpses. He then harnesses the power of lightning to bring this creature (Boris Karloff) to life.Boris Karloff's monster and Colin Clive's Frankenstein are the versions by which all others are measured. Career-defining roles for both actors and they can't be praised enough, in my mind. This movie, along with Dracula, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Frankenstein's monster for decades to come. I don't think it's a stretch to say that this film did more for Frankenstein's popularity than the source material ever did. This is certainly a very different story than the one Mary Shelley crafted, which was more philosophical in nature. In recent decades there have been attempts to produce versions of the story more faithful to Shelley but, so far, they have not been particularly successful endeavors. I have to wonder if that's not because decades of Karloff and Karloff-inspired monsters have left audiences not only expecting this version of the story, but preferring it.In addition to Karloff and Clive, the excellent cast includes Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye, who were both in Dracula. Frederick Kerr provides most of the film's humor as Baron Frankenstein. Mae Clarke plays Henry's fiancée Elizabeth. She would be replaced in Bride of Frankenstein. Boring John Boles is the film's only weak link, playing the guy trying to break up Henry and Elizabeth so he can have her to himself. This was probably a part of the plot insisted upon by the studio for demographic reasons. It adds nothing to the film and Boles' character is dropped completely from the sequel. The tired triangle plot would be reused by Universal later in Werewolf of London with nauseating results. Striking direction by James Whale, who crafts great scene after great scene. When I think of Universal horror, one scene springs to mind immediately: Colin Clive screaming ""It's alive!."" It's one of the defining moments of cinema. The film boasts impressive sets, cool sound and electrical effects, and iconic make-up by Jack Pierce. Some have criticized the lack of music score but I feel it doesn't hurt it. Frankenstein never creaks like Dracula or other early '30s films do. Whale keeps things moving and interesting, overcoming most of the limitations of the era. It's a highly influential film that inspired a host of mad scientist films. There were also some wonderful sequels to this, starting with the equally classic Bride of Frankenstein, argued by many to be even better than this film. It's definitely a must-see for anyone who loves movies and isn't prejudiced against older works.",Frankenstein

29,zardoz-13,"""Frankenstein"" Is A Classic Horror Chiller!!!",10,11 August 2010,"""Waterloo Bridge"" director James Whale's landmark horror classic ""Frankenstein"" came out in November 1931, about nine months after Universal Studios had released ""Dracula"" in February of 1931. Clearly, ""Frankenstein"" surpasses Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" in virtually every respect, except for Bela Lugosi's performance and its black & white photography. Despite having no dialogue other than grunts and snarls, Boris Karloff delivers an extraordinary performance that relies on eloquent body language and costuming to create a character that is both monstrous and sympathetic. Towering about seven feet in height, the monster possesses an imposing physical presence. No sooner has the monster been given life than he finds himself in an inhospitable world that it neither knows nor understands. Mind you, Dracula behaved like a predator from the start because he survived on the blood of others. On the contrary, the Frankenstein monster lacks any of Dracula's mental capacity for evil. Sadly, the monster behaves monstrously but it lacks an awareness of what it does. In some ways, the monster is an insane asylum inmate who has no moral understanding about life. Whereas ""Dracula"" emerged as a more literal film set in an actual moment of history, ""Frankenstein"" qualifies as a fantasy with minor elements of authenticity. Moreover, Whale and scenarists Garrett Fort of ""Dracula"" and Francis Edward Faragoh of ""Little Caesar"" never establish the actual year during which their events transpire. Although the people in ""Frankenstein"" have electricity and contemporary attire, they have no telephones, motor cars, buses, and other Twentieth century accouterments. Similarly, while ""Dracula"" takes place in actual settings, such a Transylvania and London, ""Frankenstein"" occurs somewhere in Central Europe without any specific location revealed, aside from the Goldstadt Medical University. Basically, Whale and his writers have shaped a film that has little to do with the real world. Their world is a world where people can dig up coffins and appropriate the dead on the gallows. ""Dracula"" required a real world setting to differentiate the vampire from humans. Since nobody believed in vampires, setting ""Dracula"" in an actual place at actual time gave the eponymous predator an element of mystery. According to one character in ""Dracula,"" vampires don't exist and their lack of credibility is their strongest weapon against humanity. The Frankenstein monster is a product of a fantasy and the filmmakers have no wish to try and make it real. Nevertheless, it is the fantasy of ""Frankenstein"" that makes it a more interesting movie than the literalness of ""Dracula."" Furthermore, the vampire dies in ""Dracula, but the monster and his creator survive ""Frankenstein"" and reappear in ""The Bride of Frankenstein."" The depth of the plot, the complications that creator and monster encounter, and the bits and pieces of comic relief that Whale and his writes insinuate in the narrative make ""Frankenstein"" a far more interesting film. Remember, the evil of ""Dracula"" is intentional, but the evil of the ""Frankenstein"" monster is accidental. Frankenstein is sympathetic, whereas Dracula lacks sympathy. ""Frankenstein"" is like ""The Wolfman."" The Wolfman is evil, but it is a curse on a man who is transformed on a full moon against its will into a monster. Similarly, Frankenstein—the product of many dissections and corpses—is a monster who never asked to be created but once created becomes the spawn of evil. Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive of ""Journey's End"") is engaged to Elizabeth (Mae Clarke of ""The Public Enemy""), but he is so absorbed in his work that he ignores Elizabeth. Elizabeth and one of Henry's friends, Victor Moritz (John Boles of ""The Desert Song""), visit Henry's mentor, Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan of ""Dracula""), at the Goldstadt Medical University, which Henry had been attending. Dr. Waldman explains that Henry's experiments required things that were not available to him at the university, so he left to conduct his research without limits. During one of the conversations together, Frankenstein explains to Waldman that he began his experiments by reviving dead animals. At one point he managed to keep a human heart beating for three weeks. Henry and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye of ""Dracula"") have scoured the graveyards and the gibbet for bodies, and Frankenstein has cherry picked from these human remains to construct an individual. Elizabeth, Victor and Dr. Waldman find their way to the watchtower where Henry has built a laboratory and is about to harness the power of electricity by means of lightning to give his creation life. Indeed, Elizabeth, Victor and Dr. Waldman watch in fascination as Frankenstein raises a stretcher with a body on it up about twenty feet to a platform atop the watchtower so bolts of lightning can make contact with the electrodes on either side of the monster's neck. Unlike ""Dracula"" who makes his appearance after the opening credits, the ""Frankenstein"" monster doesn't make its appearance until half way through its 70 minute running time. Dr. Waldman and Frankenstein are discussing the monster when it backs into their room and turns to look at the camera. Whereas Tod Browning was a literal, prosaic director, Whale is a visually oriented director with theatricality to his films that Browning lacks because Whale ranks as the more imaginative of the two. Critics and film historians have made much of Whale's fondness for going in one direction and then reversing into another direction. No sooner has Frankenstein made the monster than Fritz torments it with a flaming torch and a bull whip. Eventually, the monster refuses to tolerate Fritz's antics and kills him. When Frankenstein and Waldman discover Fritz's body, they lure the monster out of his room and Waldman thrust a hypodermic needle into its back and incapacitates the creature. Later, Waldman tries to dissect the monster, but it surprises and kills him. The monster escapes and kills a child by accident and everybody grabs a torch and corners it in a windmill. The monster throws its creator from the windmill and the villages burn the windmill. Frankenstein survives with no sight of the monster.",Frankenstein

The Frankenstein creature is a great tragic character and the emotions in this movie are really powerful.The Frankenstein monster is the most classic horror monster in my opinion. Yes, I'm a bigger fan of the Dracula character and movies but there is no denying that the Frankenstein monster is the most intriguing and tragic classic horror movie character. The make-up for the character is fantastic and although Boris Karloff is of course heavily overacting, he's perfect for the role, mainly because of his typical face and eyes.It also was wonderful to see Edward Van Sloan in this. Van Sloan is also known for playing Van Helsing in the classic ""Dracula"" movie and one of its sequels; ""Dracula's Daughter"" and the other classic and well known movie ""The Mummy"", also with Boris Karloff in it. So this guy has basically played in the three best, most influential and most well known horror classics of the '30's. He's a wonderful and great actor, certainly among my favorite of the '30's period along with Bela Lugosi.In my opinion the movie is better as a drama than as an horror movie.

""Dracula"" had been quite a chaotic production, tentatively advertised as 'the greatest passion the world has ever known!' but with audiences willing to accept the supernatural on screen (as opposed to the all too human villains pretending to be from the silent era) the most suitable followup had to be Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus,"" conveniently in the public domain (this effort began as ""Dracula"" ended, with an affirmative speech from actor Edward Van Sloan). Adapted from an unproduced stage version that rendered Shelley's incredibly verbose Monster effectively silent, ""Frankenstein"" became the focus for director Robert Florey, who not only contributed to the script (the brain switch) but envisioned Lugosi himself to play the scientist. Junior had other ideas, so Bela shot test reels of himself as The Monster in Golem-type makeup to an apparently apathetic response, the project taken over by James Whale after his recent success with Mae Clarke's ""Waterloo Bridge"" (Lugosi and Florey were reassigned to ""Murders in the Rue Morgue""). One actor who definitely turned down the mute role was John Carradine, who had just completed ""Heaven on Earth"" for the Laemmles and would do six more titles for them through 1935; he saw the makeup department preparing the application and knew what it was for but declined to take part for the same reason given by Lugosi, that a trained actor wasn't needed. This is where Whale's genius came to the fore since he realized that this man made creation, as envisioned in the script, was indeed little more than a grunting killing machine of little characterization and wanted it to reflect the humanity of a sympathetic outcast. That was the precise moment that a 43 year old actor was finishing up his first Universal talkie ""Graft,"" enjoying lunch in the studio commissary when the director asked to see him: ""your face has interesting possibilities..."" The face of Boris Karloff had been busy indeed in 1931, one that audiences were happy to see opposite stars like Walter Huston (""The Criminal Code""), Wheeler and Woolsey (""Cracked Nuts""), Richard Dix (""Young Donovan's Kid,"" ""The Public Defender""), James Cagney (""Smart Money""), and Edward G. Robinson (""Five Star Final""), toiling in Hollywood in almost total anonymity for 78 films (57 silents), and only now achieving some measure of character fame. Countless hours working in secret with makeup wizard Jack P. Pierce resulted in the most famous design envisioned for Mary Shelley's creature, the square shaped, flat topped appliance with electrodes attached to the neck, an exact fit for the contours of the actor's head (which is why Lon Chaney and Bela Lugosi didn't quite look right, but Glenn Strange did), able to emote freely even under such heavy bulk. Two months of grueling shooting full of long hours into the night soured Karloff on the torturous workload and inspired him to form the Screen Actors Guild to prevent studios from abusing performers under contract. Amazingly, the studio thought so little of their monster that he was not even invited to the premiere, billed in the opening credits as '?' to preserve the mystery of who was behind the makeup. After the passage of an entire century it's difficult to assess just how terrifying it would have been to see Karloff's huge presence on that 1931 theater screen, born an innocent adolescent exulting at the sun's rays, but through the tortures implemented by Dwight Frye's hunchback Fritz becomes enraged with fear and eager to avenge himself on a world that rejects him, in particular the creator who abandons him. The true revelation is Karloff's mostly untapped ability for mime, his all too human Monster inspiring youngsters to identify with and love him despite his misdeeds, 'more sinned against than sinning,' easily the most sympathetic character in the film. One patron was so frightened by the screening that he rang up a dozing James Whale at 3AM to complain: ""I can't sleep because of your picture, and I'll be damned if you're going to sleep too!"" This time Universal made no bones about playing up the horrific nature of their new blockbuster, surpassing all expectations and toppling ""Dracula"" as the new studio champion; coupled with the concurrent release of Paramount's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" the horror genre had arrived with a vengeance, creating a new audience hungering for screen terror.",Frankenstein
33,evanston_dad,A Deserved Classic,9,23 November 2005,"""Frankenstein"" is really nothing like the Mary Shelley book on which it is based, but it instead takes the story and makes it something all its own. Gone are the philosophical and allegorical qualities of the novel, and in its place is a much simpler tale about man's responsibility to the things he creates and the dangers inherent when Mankind tries to play God.Like ""King Kong"" two years later, ""Frankenstein"" manages to create an incredible amount of sympathy for its villain. Like Kong, Frankenstein's monster doesn't ask to be unleashed on the civilized world; it's not really his fault that he doesn't know how to function in it. There are gorgeous moments in this film, like the scene when the monster communicates with a little girl by the side of a lake, all the more effective because the scene quickly transitions to one of horror.And as is typical for films released in the very early days of the 30s, this movie looks better and more technologically advanced than many films that came out in the succeeding decade. The camera is more fluid, there's a more imaginative use of light and shadow, and the effects, especially in the scenes where Dr. Frankenstein brings his creation to life, and later when the angry mob has trapped the monster in a windmill and is burning it to the ground, are quite good.""Frankenstein"" is considered one of the great all-time monster movies, but it's not scary so much as it is sad and fairly moving.Grade: A",Frankenstein
34,AlsExGal,Creating the master race in Weimar Germany...,8,1 August 2018,"... how prescient of Universal Pictures! Well, actually, no. And actually, if you have read the novel, this film only loosely resembles it. For some reason Victor Frankenstein is ""Henry"", and John Bole, a family friend, is named ""Victor"". For some reason and background never given ""Victor"" is in unrequited love with Elizabeth. There is no motivation given here for Dr Frankenstein wanting to give life to a dead being like there is in the novel. And the monster he creates is mute and without reason, also unlike the novel. And yet it all works. Even now, 87 years after it was filmed it is a fun watch, not the shocking one it was in 1931, and we probably have Mel Brooks to thank for that, but that's another story. The big news here is the direction. James Whale, in one of the few smart moves Universal made in the early 30s, was given great authority with what projects he took on to direct and how he executed his job. What he produced is an artistic masterpiece. Why is all of that odd electronics in Dr. Frankenstein's lab? I am an electrical engineer and I don't know. Why did Whale decide to make this film ""present day"" when almost every other filmed version of Frankenstein is set in the 19th century? Again, I don't know, but it works. It allows Mae Clarke as Elizabeth to be dressed to the nines in the fashions of the day, and because ""the townspeople"" themselves are not yet living in modern times, it allows the settings to be gothic. There are just some unforgettable images - the townspeople after the creature as hundreds of torches that spread into the night, the old decrepit windmill almost as a distinct character in the film as the monster's last refuge, the peasant carrying his dead daughter into the celebration of Dr Frankenstein's impending wedding, the monster and the doctor facing each other with the look on the monster's face that says ""you got me into this and you are getting me out - we are in this together"".And Whale does all of this in 70 minutes with minimal dialogue and maximum use of atmosphere with an ending that is left open and is definitely precode. Highly recommended.",Frankenstein
35,Uriah43,Classic Horror Film,10,6 November 2012,"On the outskirts of the town of Goldstadt, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has converted an abandoned windmill into his personal laboratory. Obsessed with creating life from death, he begins by stitching together dead body parts from various corpses. After finally acquiring a brain from a nearby university he harnesses electricity from a lightning storm and reanimates his monstrosity known today as ""Frankenstein"" (Boris Karloff). What he doesn't know is that his assistant, ""Fritz"" (Dwight Frye) accidentally stole an abnormal brain. Because of this, and Fritz constantly tormenting him, the monster eventually goes berserk and embarks on a killing spree. Now, while most people today would find this type of classic horror film rather tame, it was a sensation when it was released in 1931. Most people give high marks for the performances of Colin Clive and Boris Karloff. Rightfully so. However, I thought Dwight Frye' performance has been vastly underrated and deserves equal applause. Likewise, Mae Clarke gave a decent performance as Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé, ""Elizabeth"". In short, although this film was made over 80 years ago it still manages to entertain audiences and I would highly recommend it for all true fans of cinema.",Frankenstein

37,anaconda-40658,It's Alive!,10,4 February 2016,"Frankenstein (1931): Dir: James Whale / Cast: Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, Dwight Frye: Frankenstein has long been presented as the creation of fear and wonder. With effective makeup effects this brutish creature is brought to life through energy and electricity through the maddening desires of Henry Frankenstein whose science aims to bring dead to life. This carries consequences once the creature breaks free and terrorizes a nearby village. Boris Karloff will be forever remembered for an effective makeup work that transforms him into a creature of brute strength. The climax in a windmill is riveting as the chase conclude and angry torch wielding villagers seek justice. Colin Clive plays Henry whose wedding is interfered with by his obsession with the reality of his creation. He will discover that controlling this creature is a whole other risk. Mae Clarke plays Henry's fiancé who cannot understand his aims, and becomes a target of the creature. Edward Van Sloan plays a medical doctor sent by Clarke to attempt to render sense to Henry, but in doing so he has a fatal encounter with the monster on a lab table. Dwight Frye plays Frankenstein's assistant Fritz, a hunchback who will be known as Igor in later versions.

38,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A classic in every sense of the word,10,2 October 2016,"Attempting to finish his experiments, a doctor's quest to reanimate the dead results in the creation of a being made from dead body parts who begins to haunt his very existence trying to keep its identity a secret from others before he's forced to finally deal with the creature once and for all.This was one of the all-time greatest films in the genre and really has a lot to like. What really works so well here for this one is the fact that it really goes overboard in explaining the intricacies of life after death with this one getting an incredibly sinister atmosphere and tone from this work. Their need for gathering up the body and getting it to the laboratory which lets the depths of his insanity take hold in his frantic raving that seals his experiments in the loony variety as his crazy actions give way to the film's highlight sequence of its reanimation. From the opulent sets filled with all manners of electronic gadgets and plenty of fanciful equipment which really bring out the grand nature of the location and the spectacle of the lightning crashing and bringing the hand to stir to life which is still one of the most visually-arresting and chilling scenes in the genre, this whole sequence scores and becomes utterly enjoyable. As well, with the great scenes of them attempting to control it in the laboratory which proves incredibly difficult with his violent tendencies and begins lashing out at them forcing their need to dispose of it before it escapes which is where there's plenty of fun to be had here with the creature loose in the countryside generating more solid fun with the legendary sequence of it with the little girl and finally appearing at the house during the wedding which is another great and truly fun sequence. Finally, the action-packed spectacle that is the finale is one of the best in the genre with its full-scale hunting of the creature out in the mountains and leading to the big battle at the windmill where not only is there the torch-wielding mob to contend with but also the brawling of the doctor that makes for a rather fun and frantic series of scenes here and really give this the kind of spectacular finish needed in this kind of movie. All told these efforts here, as well as the exceptionally chilling monster make-up and the legendary personality given to the creature which is still one of the greatest portrayal of the concept ever, really give this one so much to like that it manages to hold up over the few minor and barely detrimental elements present here which comes from the rather unnecessary and irrelevant scenes of them getting married and celebrating by the atrocious dance-number which is just seemingly endless and really out-of-place in this type of film. That leads to a dull part of the film where they ignore the creature altogether and it really hampers the film somewhat as it sticks out against the rest of the fun action, but otherwise there's a lot to really like with this one.Today's Rating/PG: Violence.",Frankenstein
39,AaronCapenBanner,Boris Karloff's Signature Role.,8,23 October 2013,"James Whale directed this loose but landmark adaptation of Mary Shelly's novel. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein, a driven and obsessed surgeon who digs up graves of the recently deceased in order to build his own living being. Dwight Frye plays his loyal assistant Fritz, Mae Clarke his concerned fiancée Elizabeth, John Boles his concerned friend Victor, Frederick Kerr his ailing but stubborn Baron father. It is Boris Karloff who delivers an Academy Award worthy performance as the creature, playing him with such sympathy and humanity despite his horrid appearance, that it is remarkable. His desperate gestures yet frustrated rage is unforgettable, as are many classic lines and the fiery windmill climax. Only negative is that it is sometimes creaky, and the ""wrap up"" in the castle incongruous, but otherwise this holds up superbly.",Frankenstein

His fiancée Elizabeth and friend Victor are worried about his health, he spends far too long in his laboratory. But he's successful and the creature he's made come to life is gentle, but simple. Henry's father brings his son to his senses and he agrees that the monster should be destroyed. Before they can do so however, the monster escapes and in its innocence, kills a little girl. The villagers rise to destroy the creature........Out of all the Universal Monster classics of the thirties, this is the ultimate one. This is the one that still shocks and endears you at the same time, and that is due to the brilliant portrayal of the creature by Karloff.His body language and his movements say so much about the pain and the anguish that the creature is feeling, and the scene with the little girl still is one of the most shocking scenes to ever feature in a pre 'Gornography' horror world.But even though he doe a what he does, you still feel so much empathy for the creature, and the fact that you know he will get no reprieve for his actions, just makes the film that more harrowing to watch.The rest of the cast are fine, in that thirties acting class way they all appear to have, and again, the sets and the matte paintings only add compliment to the film.Compared to other Monster movies of that era, this is definitely one of the best, and its essential to any horror fan.",Frankenstein
41,The_Void,An amazing achievement for horror cinema,8,23 March 2006,"Along with Tod Browning's Dracula, Frankenstein was one of the films that launched Universal as a major horror studio; and even now, over seven decades since its release; James Whale's cinematic interpretation of Mary Shelly's classic novel is still an outstanding expose of horror. The film is famous for several things; the image of Boris Karloff (credited as '?') in the role of Frankenstein's Monster being the most famous of them. This is the role that announced the great Boris Karloff to the world of cinema, and he justifies that with an outstanding portrayal of the monster. Karloff takes what could have been a cold, lifeless role and gives it warmth - so much, in fact, that it's actually very easy to believe that '?' really is Frankenstein's Monster. The plot will be familiar to anyone who's ever heard the name 'Frankenstein' and follows a mad genius with the idea of creating a corpse and giving it life. Before long, he's harnessed the power and lightning and is screaming ""it's alive!"" But when the monster escapes its creator, Frankenstein's position in high society, his marriage and even his life comes under threat.The fact that the story is so well known harms the film in a way, as you pretty much always know what's coming next. Director James Whale combats this with a constantly foreboding atmosphere, from which he springs high amounts of tension - and even though we know what's coming, Whale makes us want to see it come. The story is rich with moral themes, most notably a parable about the ills of man playing God. This comes across well in Whale's film adaptation, and by the time the stunning climax appears on screen; we are left with no doubt that Dr Frankenstein was wrong to push the limits of science. Some of the acting is a bit wooden; but this is made up for by Colin Clive's energetic performance as the title character. He revels in this role, and that is always obvious as he commands every scene that he's in. If I had to nitpick to find negative elements, I'd highlight the fact that despite the morbid themes on display; the film is largely too pleasant. Maybe it's because of the time it was made; but a darker tone would have fit the tale better. It's a small criticism, however, and overall, Whale's classic tale of horror is still an amazing achievement and will always be a must see for fans of cinema.",Frankenstein
42,Sylviastel,A Classic Frankenstein!,10,16 December 2005,"This was really the first film about Frankenstein. While it is over seventy years old, it is still amazing to watch. It's one of those early cinematographic achievements that remind us the origins of film-making. Colin Clive is superb as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Unfortunately, he died of alcoholism. He could have accomplished so much more in his acting career if he had stayed off the sauce. The monster of Frankenstein has poignant moments like the scene with the little girl by the lake. I don't think he knew his own strength when he threw her into the water. I think he thought it's what she wanted. He didn't know any better. There is a great morality in this tale about cloning and playing God. Doctors today still play God by creating monsters. The cloning issue is a today issue and this film can remind us of the consequences when you play with God. You have to feel sympathy for Frankenstein. HE did not asked to be born or created. I am sure that there will always be remakes but this is the best original Frankenstein. The other version was silent. I felt that this film transcend time and reminded us of the early golden days of Hollywood where they were just happy with speaking in films. Maybe our film industry has gone too far, they have forgotten about language and character development.",Frankenstein

44,StevePulaski,The personification of horror,10,28 October 2013,"One look at Frankenstein's face, complete with his dead eyes, hideous skin, and bolts protruding on opposite signs of his head and you have seen the very personification of horror. After the release of Dracula sparked critical and audience acclaim, Universal had to act fast to assure even longer viability in the slumping U.S. economy. Their knee-jerk reaction to the success of the aforementioned feature led to the creation of James Whale's Frankenstein, a tremendous horror film that functions more like a carefully-pieced together, highly detailed drama that does the impossible - humanize a monster.The film stars Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein, a young scientist who works with his hunchback assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) to create a man out the parts of that have been collected over time. Frankenstein's ultimate goal is to create a human and give him a sustainable life using a variety of electrical devices.And thus, he creates a revolting monster, who is portrayed by the almighty and iconic Boris Karloff (credited as ""?"" in the opening titles). Karloff, whose entire character relies on grunts, groans, and laborious movement, has the biggest challenge in the film and that's to make his greatly limited monster interesting with very little character traits.It is when we, the audience, realize that the monster Dr. Frankenstein has created may indeed have some humanity buried inside of him. Consider the scene when he bonds with a little girl due to her fascination that she can take small flowers and make their buds/pedals float in a body of water (she refers to the discovery as ""boats""). Karloff infuses the lumbering monster with recognizable human traits such as tenderness and empathy, showing a soul exists beneath the rigid exterior.Such a film needs a strong leading man (or monster in this case) in addition to direction that caters to the film in a way that adds rather than basks in ordinariness. Seeing that Whale's scenes are never without significant detail and never conducted ridiculously, the latter trait is met. In addition, Karloff's memorable performance works on a terrific level adding to the film's tonal eeriness.The 1931 adaption of Frankenstein undoubtedly deserves its place among the classic monster films as it's hard to get more iconic than the Mary Shelley character. Its material may be compelling, but its message that humans should never attempt to play or act as God is one of the strongest takeaway points in any monster films I've ever seen.Starring: Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, and Dwight Frye. Directed by: James Whale.",Frankenstein
45,Smells_Like_Cheese,An awesome monster classic,10,15 January 2004,"Frankenstein is one of the best movies of all time, it's certainly memorable and is just such a pleasure to watch, I always make time to watch this movie. There's just something so special about it, I think this was the first monster movie that gave the monster a soul and one that just very much touched our hearts. But what made Frankenstein so scary was how this poor creature was just left alone and never knew his own strength, leading him to do some horrific things. Frankenstein is a beautifully shot movie and the black and white made it just more scary and imaginative. Boris Karloff is just an amazing actor and pulls in a timeless performance and is still remembered to this day. Frankenstein is a movie that will never be forgotten and will always deliver a good cry, laugh, and scare.Dr. Henry Frankenstein is a scientist who has accomplished so much in his life, but there is one thing on his mind to what his next experiment would be, but he wants to re-animate dead tissue, in English, he wants to see if he could bring people back to life. He creates a creature from a hanged criminal, but he doubles the creature in size, making him incredibly strong. The experiment works, but when the creature escapes, he goes onto the village to meet others. He meets a sweet young girl who plays with him, but when he plays with her back, he doesn't realize his own strength and accidentally kills her. The village goes after the creature and they want to destroy Henry's projects along with the monster.Frankenstein is truly a remarkable horror movie, the first Frankenstein movie, when you watch it, I know because of fancy effects of today's horror movies have taken place in what is true horror, which I believe is how a movie could be so intense. Frankenstein is an intense movie that will definitely have you on the edge of your seat and realize how just an incredible performance can pull in a horrific but also loving monster that'll make you scream and cry at the same time. If you are a true movie fan, you have to see Frankenstein, the ultimate monster movie classic.10/10",Frankenstein
46,DKosty123,Creepiest of early Monster Films,7,5 November 2006,"The mood for this film is set with the introduction in the beginning. Despite crude early sound film technology still is use when this was made, the introduction is lived up too. This film is creepy beyond most films.Karloff does fine service as the monster. The rest of the cast in this serious film does great too. In fact, this one is good enough that the second film , The BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is well set up.One of the things that makes this film really scary is the sections where there is no background music or sounds. This is the cinema equivalent of scratching across a blackboard. The lack of sound makes what is really scary even worse as you mind tries to fill in the blankness with the events on the film.This film established UNIVERSAL as the monster film master for many years. Because of this franchise, the studio used the rights to these to make money for many years, & Frankenstsin's likeness was used so often that the process of make-up was actually patented.The film is starting to suffer the ravages of old age, but the plot itself is ageless as recent remakes prove, but none of the remakes gets any eerier than the original.

47,Red-Barracuda,One of the most influential horror films of all time,7,18 August 2013,"It's easy to forget that this adaption of the famous Mary Shelley novel was made 113 years after the book was written. It's such an old movie that it's surprising to think that even now in 2013 we are still a lot closer in time to the movie than the movie was to the book when released. It's partially because Frankenstein is a film that seems so old because it created so many of the rules and iconography of the horror genre. It was in fact one of the first sound horror films as well. So much has been already said about it that there isn't a lot more to add. But needless to say it's a film that will always be appreciated and loved.It also made the character actor Boris Karloff into a horror icon. Up until that point, he had starred in many films but it was only here where he became a superstar. His performance is rightly well regarded; he brings so much pathos to the character of The Monster. Director James Whale has to be given a lot of credit here too because he was responsible for the way that the material was presented. In other hands the creature would have been a homicidal killer and no more but here he is a character to sympathise with. The Monster was similar to the later King Kong in that he was both villain but mostly victim. The film is wildly different to Shelley's novel. It had to be really because the book is a very densely written text full of melodrama and poetic prose. It's very exaggerated and unrealistic and needed a different angle in order to work cinematically. Whale achieved this with some success by underpinning the narrative with a very human story. He is also helped considerably by great set design and expressionistic lighting. The latter showed the definite influence of the silent German horror classics such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. Along with Dracula, which was also released the same year, Frankenstein launched the Universal horror cycle and set the scene for the early 30's horror boom.",Frankenstein

C) The Towns People - The one's that wanted to destroy the monster and stop Frankenstein from more scientific experiments.Maybe no one in this movie is actually evil. The monster could not help the fact he is alive nor could he help the brain that was put into his head. Frankenstein just wants to conduit experiments to keep people alive, living again. The towns people have a right to be afraid of a monster that has killed.The story of Frankenstein has brought many questions as to ethics concerning the dead and dying. Should science meddle in such matters? Each of us know how we feel on the subject - that is up to you.

49,OllieSuave-007,A classic first movie of Frankenstein's monster.,7,20 October 2015,"This is the original film version of Mary Shelley's classic novel about the Dr. Frankenstein and his monstrous creation that came to life. It was a fast-paced, to-the-point movie with an eerie atmosphere and a dark, mysterious cinematography, especially the screen capture of the Dr. Frankenstein's foreboding castle. Boris Karloff gave a very creepy and frighten portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster - his crackling growl, towering height and droopy eyes represented that of a true monster-coming-to-life. He was indeed the highlight of the movie, along with the troubled Dr. Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive. Much of the acting was great and brought on more emotion than those in ""Dracula,"" but much of the plot rushed through, living little for character development and suspense.

50,sddavis63,A Monster We Can Feel Sorry For,7,11 May 2008,"Of all the ""monsters"" constructed out of the human imagination, I can't imagine one more sympathetic than Frankenstein's monster. In fact, I have trouble even thinking of him as a monster. Instead, he surely must be Frankenstein's ""creature"" or Frankenstein's ""creation."" It's the sympathetic nature of the creature that gives the movie it's greatest power - it's perhaps the only ""monster movie"" I can think of where I feel sorry for the actual monster (true, one feels sorry for the afflicted people who become werewolves, but not for the actual werewolf.) Think about this poor creature. After his creation by Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) he is, by Frankenstein's own admission, kept isolated and in darkness, and his only regular ""companionship"" seems to have been from the hunchback Fritz (Dwight Frye) - Frankenstein's assistant who takes great delight in tormenting the creature with torches and whips. Under the circumstances, could the creature have been expected to turn out to be a ballet dancer? This movie is both a social worker's and a psychologist's delight. The social worker will see in the creature a classic depiction of an abused child (for that's what the creature was - as Frankenstein himself put it, he didn't give life back to the dead, this ""body"" had never lived in its new form; it was, in fact, a child.) For the psychologist there's a study of obsession in Frankenstein (who, it seems to me, gives up on his creature altogether too easily) and Fritz is a wonderful character from the psychological perspective: a man probably tormented and ridiculed and abused all his life, who suddenly - when the opportunity presents itself - becomes the tormenter, abuser and ridiculer. But the creature is always an object of sympathy. When he killed Fritz, I thought ""good for him!"" When he killed the little girl Maria (Marilyn Harris) it's clearly portrayed as a dreadful accident - he was playing with her, but he was too strong for her. When the windmill breaks out in flames, how can one not empathize with the creature's terror? And yet - in the powerful sympathetic portrayal of the creature also lies the story's greatest weakness. After constructing the body from the parts of dead bodies (and I must confess that I wondered, when Frankenstein lifted the creature's hand - before it was brought to life - and proudly exclaimed ""no decay"", I wondered ""why?"" It certainly didn't look like there was a refrigerated morgue in that place to keep the body fresh!) Frankenstein sends Fritz to a local medical school to steal a brain. Great play is made from the fact that the brain Fritz came back with was a criminal's brain - an evil one from a violent man, as Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) described it. We're clearly to think that the evil brain was somehow responsible for the creature turning out this way, but that was inconsistent with everything else portrayed here. Here we find an early example of nature vs. nurture. I never thought that the havoc wreaked by the creature was because of its brain. The creature didn't have an evil nature; it was the way it was because of the way it was nurtured. The whole ""evil brain"" story underlying the monster's actions seemed to me to weaken the story.Boris Karloff was magnificent as the creature. In a voiceless role (aside from a few growls) he managed to portray a huge range of emotions: confusion, anger, fear, rage, playfulness, excitement, panic-stricken terror just to name a few. Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman offered what I thought was his best performance in the Universal ""monster movie"" collection - at least of those I've seen. Dr. Waldman seemed more rounded and certainly more emotional than Van Helsing in ""Dracula"" or Muller in ""The Mummy."" Clive did a good job of portraying two sides of Frankenstein - the obsessed scientist who wants to play God, and the repentant one who wants nothing more than to turn the clock back, and Mae Clarke was pretty good as his fiancé Elizabeth. The only disappointment in performances was that of Dwight Frye as Fritz. After a brilliant performance as Renfield in ""Dracula"" I didn't think he really captured this role.Two scenes stay with me from this movie. Maria's death - which clearly the creature didn't mean to happen - and the panicked creature trapped in the burning windmill. (I'd have liked the movie to have ended with that scene, actually.) So - great performances, but the issue of the brain left me a little cold, and detracted from the best and most meaningful issue raised by the story. All in all - 7/10",Frankenstein

52,bensonmum2,"""Crazy, am I? We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.""",9,24 May 2006,"Revisiting Frankenstein is always a wonderful experience. I watch it today with the same enthusiasm and awe I did nearly 35 years ago. Everything about the film is so perfect. Acting, direction, cinematography, set design, plot, dialogue, special effects, etc. are top notch. And although each of these areas deserves to be discussed in detail (and have in the volumes that have been written on Frankenstein), I'll focus on two areas that really standout to me - Boris Karloff as the monster and James Whales direction.Is there a more iconic image in horror than Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster? I sincerely doubt it. Even those who wouldn't be caught dead watching a horror film are familiar with that image. Beyond Jack Pierce's make-up, Karloff is amazing in the role. Even with the make-up, Karloff gives the monster life. We are able to see and feel the emotions the monster goes through. There is no better example than the scene with the monster and the little girl. As the monster stumbles out of the woods, there is a cautious look about him as his experiences with humans have thus far been less than satisfactory. But when the little girl accepts him and wants to play with him, the look of caution is transformed into a look of utter happiness. He smiles, he laughs, and he plays. But that emotion is replaced by one of confusion mixed with anger when he accidentally kills the girl. It's all there on Karloff wonderful face. It's this life that Karloff imbibes in the monster that makes Frankenstein a real classic.I've always thought that James Whale's direction was ahead of its time. In an era when directors were using what I call the ""plant and shoot"" method of filming, Whale made his camera a fluid part of the action. Whale takes the viewer beyond just watching moving images. He uses the camera to take the viewer into the scene. A small example is the way Whale filmed characters moving from one room to the next. The camera moves with the characters. Another example is the tracking shot Whale uses as the father carries his dead child into the town. As I said earlier, it has a fluidity in the way Whale filmed these scenes that makes it seem more natural. Finally, the way Whale introduces the monster is a highlight of the film. The monster backs into the room. As he turns, Whale shows the monster with three quick, ever tighter shots, ending with a close-up of the monster's face. Every Hollywood star of that era could have only wished for an introduction like that.While I have done nothing but praise Frankenstein, I'm not such a fan that I can't spot flaws in the film. The major issue with me has always been the way the scenes of action, horror, and violence are inter-cut with scenes of tranquility and bliss. I realize that was the way things were done in the 30s so people wouldn't, in essence, overload on horror, but it can make the film seem a little disjointed. But it's difficult to hold Whale overly responsible for this custom of the period.",Frankenstein
53,sol-kay,Remember get him alive if you can but Get Him!,8,25 October 2006,"(There are Spoilers) Being infatuated with the thought of creating life out of dead bodies since he was in medical school Dr. Henry Frankenstein, Colin Clive, had locked himself up in a deserted watchtower outside of Goldstadt Germany to continue his research undisturbed.With his faithful but somewhat bumbling assistant Fritz,Dwight Fray, Henry had been raiding graveyards and execution gallows for fresh bodies to assemble and put together in creating a living human being. Now he's just about ready to do it, all he needs is a brain with Fritz send out by Henry to the local medical collage to fetch one.Breaking into the medical school that night Fritz grabs the jar containing a normal human brain but as the bell tolled at midnight he, startled by the sound, dropped it and took in his haste a jar containing the brain of a just executed murderer. The brain being the last piece of the puzzle in Henry's experiment everything was ready for the big night, which was a predicted thunderstorm, for the body made up of different peoples body parts to get a jolt of lighting, or what Henry called the Great Ray, to bring it back to life. Being interrupted by his fiancée Elizabeth, Mae Clarke, and his two friends his professor in collage Dr. Waldman, Edward Von Slone, and Victor Moritz, John Boles,Henry allows them into his watchtower, or laboratory, and out of the rain to be in attendance and see history in the making; The Creation of LIFE!The thing that Henry had put together is lifted up on some kind of pulley and immediately struck by a lighting bolt and withing seconds it amazingly starts to move it's hand! This has Henry go into an hysterical fit screaming with satisfaction, to himself and all those who took him to be an insane lunatic. It Alive! It's Alive! and again It's Alive! Yes it,???, was alive all right and before the movie is finally over It will turn the peaceful and quiet little German village of Goldstadt into a house of horrors.Meek and harmless at first It, the Frankenstein monster, got very pi**ed at Fritz for constantly sticking a flaming torch in It's face. Taking pleasure at pestering the much bigger and stronger monster Fritz is later caught off guard by It who ends up breaking his neck and hanging him up in the watchtower dungeon. Sick and tired of being locked up It takes off, after murdering Dr. Waldman, and goes out into the light terrorizing the countryside. With one of It's victims being little Maria, Marilyn Harris, whom It accidentally killed by throwing her into the lake when It ran out of daisy peddles. Poor Maria was playing a game of daises with the big lug who, in his excitement, just got carried away with it and thus instinctively carried and dumped Maria into the lake where she drowned.The townspeople up in arms over what It did gather together and form a number of posses to get It before It gets them. The mob then chase It into a nearby windmill where It, after confronting and knocking him out, takes It's creator Dr. Henry Frankenstein along with It.Unforgeatable climax with It frantically holding off the good people of Goldstadt who are out to get It dead or alive and ending up trapped in the windmill as It threw Henry, who survived, out of it. With the windmill set on fire by the angry townspeople it was only a matter of time before It would be history. To everyones fear as well as delight It was come back over and over again in films and on the TV, that wasn't around back then in 1931. As the years went by with It becoming new and more improved, due to the evolution of movie special effects, It was to scare the hell out of future generations of moviegoers and TV watchers who were yet to be born when It was supposedly burned to death.",Frankenstein
54,Robert_duder,Quietly brilliant and easily a classic,8,1 November 2012,"I had the great pleasure for seeing this film for what I am sure was the first time ever on the big screen yesterday on Halloween. I am certain I have seen pieces of it over the years but simply never sat down to watch it. What a moving and deeply dark piece of early horror cinema. I know that Frankenstein, the story has always been heralded for having a very deep empathetic emotion for this monster out of its element and trying to survive and find its place but what surprised me is that this film from the thirties actually captures that sensitive, powerful emotion. Unlike Dracula from the same time Frankenstein is not campy or rely on cheesy special effects. The effects are solid, in fact I think even stand up today when you look at them. The work put into this film was clearly intensive and because of that it is still a classic 7 decades later. There are some good performances followed but an astounding performance in the role of the monster.I will start with that role played by Boris Karloff. He has been stereotyped in this role as the monster but I had no idea he did it so brilliantly well. He does not speak a single word and yet gives such a powerful, deeply moving performance. He is frightening and yet you will feel for him. Colin Clive is our Dr. Frankenstein. He certainly plays the mad scientist role well and the chemistry with Karloff is good. Mae Clarke is good although she doesn't have a lot of reason to be in the film other than the woman that keeps Frankenstein grounded. I'm still not sure the point of the character played by John Boles. Handsome guy but pointless to the film and yet has significant screen time. Really enjoyed the small role by Frederick Kerr as Clive's father. He was a great comic relief but done well with taste to the overall feel for the story.Director James Whale told this story so well, especially give its time. The run time is relatively short and yet he manages to take the story and bring to it every aspect you would expect from the novel. The dark gritty setting of the tower and the village all make for a powerful looking film. Obviously a film so old shows its age and it would be impossible not to see the flaws but for a film like this and for its time it is just really wonderful to watch. If you have not seen this and you love classic film you'll depriving yourself of one of the greats. 8/10",Frankenstein
55,ElMaruecan82,"""It's alive!"" ""It's alive!""",9,9 March 2018,"And just as if it embraced the liveliness of the moment, here's perhaps the most climactic non-climactic scene of cinema's history. The thunder resonates in the background, inside the ominous laboratory, an elaborate machinery and confusing electric devices infuse the secret ray of life into a seemingly lifeless body... until a hand starts raising slowly, it's slow, but it's alive, much alive.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) says that he finally knows how it feels to be God, but I don't think the scene is subversive on a religious level as much as it is on the sexual pre-Code fashion. I said the scene is climactic because it truly plays like a climax. And what we saw before, the 'mad scientist' and his hunchback assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) collecting bodies and brain from corpses and medical schools, and the whole machinery, was just the preliminaries.Interestingly, the pre-Monster part (the iconic creature only appears after thirty minutes) is intercut with scenes involving Henry's love interest Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) sharing her concerns with her bland (and obviously infatuated) friend Victor (John Boles). Even the grouchy Baron Frankenstein, the father (played by a scene-stealing Frederick Kerr) is lamenting about his son's disappearance, convinced that there is another woman. There is something too trivial and mundane for a 'horror' movie in these ""where has he gone?"" scenes if it wasn't for the way they establish some sort of cheating. But look at Clive talking about his obsession to create life, his eyes burning with a gleam of defiance, at that point, he doesn't have a God complex. He is God (and aren't we all feeling the same when we're so good at it). When Elizabeth and Victor reach Henry's former tutor Dr. Waldman (Edward Von Sloan), the old man explains that his brilliant pupil took himself for God, wishing to resurrect life and create the perfect human body, that's the kind of cheating he perceived.
Finally, this dichotomy of sexual and religious cheating culminates with the birth of Frankenstein, and when Henry utters the immortal ""It's alive!"" he raises his head and seems to address God, provoking more fury if we judge by the thunder (a failed attempt to censor a controversial line) but look at how his eyes almost bulge as he's at the verge of fainting with an ecstatic look on his face while the men are trying to hold him tight. Colin Clive left that world too soon in 1937 but that was a scene for posterity, this is clearly an orgasm moment, the height of accomplishment, not contradicted but validated by the following scene where he's calmer and discuss his work while smoking.And the film hadn't even reached its first half, we still had to read a second chapter of cinema's history and discover the face of Frankenstein not as Mary Shelley invented it but how a genius designer artist did, with the electrodes, and the asphalt shoes, leaving a new pop culture icon for posterity, after Dracula and the Mommy. As far back as I can remember, from ""The Groovy Ghoolies"" to an ugly mask that used to scare the hell out of me, that's how I pictured Frankenstein, years before seeing the film. Even better, I never imagined him as a bad monster, but always as a slow, dim-witted but well-meaning creature. And it's so satisfying to see that the seminal movie never really contradicts this idea, as soon as Boris Karloff gets his first close-up, it's near impossible to believe that this creature is any bad, even if it didn't have the 'good brain'. ""Frankenstein"" was literally born from that orgasmic birth scene and it embodies the idea that men are born good and get corrupted with time. But the creature can only raise hands to the sky as a sign of divine gratitude. At the same moment, Fritz threatens it with the fire and both he and Henry mistakes the creature's panicked reaction for an attack.The creature illustrates that conception about children going to heaven, it's a child who longs for heaven while condemned to the hell of men, incarnated by that twirling torch. Yet the film is interesting in the way it never turns the Creator into the villain while never making the Creature the villain, It's just as if it questioned our own attitude with religion or God: are we prone to vileness or is it because we do believe we've been created as God's images and we act as bad and unfairly as we think He does with us. Ironically, before regretting it, Henry was also trying to play God and got a good taste of his own medicine.It was extraordinary that Mary Shelly wrote at the age of 19 this thought-provoking commentary about human hubris, and through a simple concept, a man creating a monster making us wonder if he wasn't a monster creating a man. I guess Frankenstein isn't much a man as he's a child, and it's no surprise that his first friendly encounter is with a child. And that the professor, for all the bad things he's done, got away with it after all, is a proof that he succeeded in his God-like role.To conclude, James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" has the word ""iconic"" written in every single frame that it almost distracts a modern audience from fully appreciating its impact on the simple narrative aspect. Instead of listening to the opening disclaimer, I kept thinking of Marge Simpson introduction of a ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode, but concerning the bit when Von Sloan said that it was a tale of life and death, I think in retrospect that the film goes deeper than that, there's a lot of sexual and religious undertones.The film opens with a funeral and ends with a men raising his glass to the birth of a grandson, life and death? Yeah, but can they go never without religion and sex, I doubt it. ""Frankenstein"" might be dated at times for all its smoothly subversive take on life, resolutely modern and holds back pretty well after eight decades.",Frankenstein

It may not be the 'Frankenstein' of Mary Shelley's book, (it leaves out a lot of the novel), but visually it's extraordinary and in Boris Karloff it has a 'monster' unsurpassed to this day. Karloff may have been a dumb hulk prone to chucking obnoxious little girls into lakes but he imbued 'the creature' with a real humanity and with only a few small gestures. The film made him a star though unfortunately he was typecast for the rest of his career. It also should have made Whale one of the hottest directors in Hollywood but perhaps he, too, was typecast. He did make the magnificent sequel a couple of years later and the best screen version of ""Showboat"" but after that, really not much else of note. Still, these were enough to earn him his place in movie legend and this is seventy of the finest minutes in Hollywood history.",Frankenstein

There are a couple of iconic moments, including the fast cut to tight shots on Boris Karloff as we first see Frankenstein's monster. However, after some great initial scenes in the graveyard, the direction by James Whale often takes us away from scenes of interest or tension, and doesn't delve deeply enough into the darkness of 'playing god'. Instead we get silliness, such as the assistant getting the jar marked 'Abnormal Brain'. This one hasn't aged well, and I would 1932's 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'instead.",Frankenstein
58,Cineanalyst,Filmed Reanimation,9,22 August 2018,"Mary Shelley's novel is a rich text for film adaptations. It's about science, electricity, machinery, stitched-together parts, reanimation and creation. Cinema is born of all that. Since re-reading the book, I've been reviewing a bunch of Frankenstein films, and it's disappointing that so few realize the potential of this metaphor, of the monster as movie. Yet, as in everything else, this one is better than most. It's hardly the most faithful adaptation, as if that matters, but much of what it emphasizes and alters adds to the allegory. The original creation from 1816, of course, didn't conceive of an invention decades in the waiting, but it's not the role of film to slavishly render the intent and particulars of a novel's plot--especially not this one, which is about endowing life not by ordinary means, but by an entirely new conception. Thus, it's natural a Frankenstein film create something different.In the beginning, Dr. Frankenstein and his hunchbacked assistant are established as observers, hiding behind the graveyard gate, as they await the end of a burial. This is the filming stage of creation. They, then, proceed onto the set of the graveyard, and, indeed, it's literally and obviously a studio artifice despite its exterior position within the narrative. As it should be, too, because naturalism is antithetical to what ""Frankenstein"" is about, so why not exteriors as artificial as the scientist's creation. They collect the raw material of corpses and a brain--read: the film. These various parts are stitched together - edited - into a new whole. Finally, in a magnificent laboratory of moving machinery and electric flashes, both inside by means of Jacob's Ladders and other gizmos and outside from lightning, they animate the being like the projection of cinema.Live-action film involves the capturing of animate subjects, like people, by turning them into inanimate objects (that is, the capturing of their images as a series of still photographs); then, these inanimate objects are reanimated when they're projected on a screen. Frankenstein's creation and creature assume the same process: animate-inanimate-reanimate. Life, death, and life again. Thus, we have a metaphor of both the processes of filmmaking and of film itself. Some have proposed Ben Franklin as an inspiration for Shelley's story, but in this case, a more apt parallel can be drawn between Frankenstein and Thomas Edison, who was still largely considered in the 1930s to be the inventor of motion pictures, as well as the light bulb and electricity.Many of the deviations here from the book are probably carried over from the stage, including the hunchback, which would figure so prominently in Universal's monster movies, and I assume that's where Henry and Victor's names were traded, as Henry was the name of Victor Frankenstein's friend in the novel. The same thing happened to the Mina and Lucy characters in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" which was also continued in some of the movies. The love triangle between Henry, Victor and Elizabeth and the expansion of Professor Waldman's role, which is similar to the Van Helsing played by the same actor in Universal's prior ""Dracula"" (1931), are likely inventions of this film, though. I like Edward Van Sloan's early part in connecting what would become Universal's shared universe of monsters. By playing the wise doctor and lecturer in Universal's first two entries and by providing the now-lost epilogue to ""Dracula"" and the prologue to ""Frankenstein,"" where he breaks the fourth wall in an address to the audience, he links the pictures. He was also the only actor to reprise his role (although they screwed up his name and character) in ""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936).I also believe that the laboratory here is a radical design; contrary to what some suggest, it's strikingly different than the also-excellent sequence in ""Metropolis"" (1926). The monster's scene with little Maria, indeed, recalls a similar scene from another German film about creation, too, ""The Golem"" (1920), but it's also a variation on the fate of William, Victor Frankenstein's young brother from the book. The burning of the windmill tower has also been compared to a scene from ""The Magician"" (1926), an MGM production, but one that stars Paul Wegener, a German who also made ""The Golem.""The angry mob (another would-be staple of Universal's later monster movies) and the fiery climax are interesting for another reason, though, and that's what it suggests concerning the story's simile with film. Like ""King Kong"" (1933), which is even more explicitly analogous to cinema, the monster that is the surrogate within the narrative for the movie itself wreaks havoc. Quite unlike Shelley's creature, this one kills indiscriminately, as well as for retribution and by mere accident. No wonder that Van Sloan warns spectators ahead of time rather than waiting to comfort them at the end as in ""Dracula,"" lest the mob turn on the film itself like the censors would by dissecting parts they deemed offensive. Ever more, lest they turn on the filmmakers, whom represented by Frankenstein form a metaphorical dopplegänger with the monster--a theme, by the way, that the film does rather well in adapting from Shelley. Additionally, the creature's fear of fire is striking. The nitrate film used back then was extremely combustible, which is why most silent films and many early talkies are now lost. A seeming time capsule, a form of immortality, too many films have had their true mortality revealed by burning. Ablaze, the windmill turning like a reel in a projector is a fitting fiery finale.As an early talkie and really only Universal's second go at the horror genre they largely introduced to Hollywood with ""Dracula"" and confirmed by ""Frankenstein,"" it does seem to be lacking for its creakiness and absence of a score, but that's common of the era. Plus, the monster's lack of speech is refreshing for the age of early talkies, bombarded by inane blather. This one also isn't camped up as with director James Whale's sequel, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), but much of the cast, especially Colin Clive, Dwight Frye and, of course, Boris Karloff, as assisted by make-up artist Jack Pierce, do well at striking a middle ground that is neither realistic or entirely over-the-top. Perhaps, most wanting is a mise-en-abyme, a film-within-the-film, to make the metaphor explicit. The homunculi of Dr. Pretorius provide this in the sequel. Nevertheless, few Frankenstein films near, yet they often imitate, this one's creativity.",Frankenstein

60,secondtake,"More dramatic and disturbing than scary, a defining masterpiece!",10,29 September 2010,"Frankenstein (1931)There is a problem with a movie like this of what to say that hasn't been said. Well, first of all, it's a total trip to watch it still. It's dated in some ways, for sure, and is low budget and that shows sometimes. But if you get in the spirit of that, and wait to get into the castle when the real sparks fly, it's unbelievable. And then you get to the true pathos of the monster loose in the world, and realize you are worried about his well being.It's hard to imagine anyone but Karloff as the monster (Lugosi would have made the movie very different, and would have perhaps tainted how we see Dracula, as well). But the iconic monster with the bolts on the neck (thanks to Jack Pierce, make-up artist) is worth the ride alone. And then the frightened villagers, the innocent girl, the fire in the castle, on and on. For a movie just over an hour long, a lot happens, and a lot happens with gusto.James Whale is famous mostly for this one film. That's fine with me, even though he has some other terrific ones (Bride of Frankenstein as good as this one in many ways, and The Invisible Man, and check out his version of Waterloo Bridge).

I hated how people treated the monster and I was so down in the dumps by the end that I abstained from watching again until recently.The film deviates massively from Mary Shelley's novel (it is adapted via a stage play) with many peculiar changes along way. The epic story and adventure is substituted with Gothic sets maniacal over-acting by the wild-eyed Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein. I guess when Universal opted for a 70-minute quickie the bulk of the story had to go, only the basics remain, but it's still a strong connection to Shelley's work.Maybe it's just my fondness for Herman Munster, but the iconic Universal image of the Monster is definitely the best.

One reason I hadn't watched it in so long was that I remembered how bad the prints were that they showed on t.v. then. So I was very pleased at how pristine the print TCM has been showing is. Quite impressive. Of course, the quality of the print also made the cheap background paintings vividly obvious.I was particularly interested in seeing the film, because just a few days before I had seen another film with John Boles, whom I didn't recognize at all.Like many old films, the directors weren't always very logical about assuring that certain things ""made sense"". For example, why would a university simply leave preserved brains in a classroom overnight? And why does Dr. Frankenstein lock his fiancé in the bedroom on the day of their marriage BEFORE he knows that his doctor/teacher has been killed and that the monster is loose? Despite such mistakes, and considering that this film was released in 1931...it's a masterpiece, and worth watching if only for its historical value.

On the one hand, the film has captivated me with the perfect atmosphere and visually, but on the other, it is so rushed and undeveloped that the characters and the story left me indifferent. This story should convey the message that things are not always what they seem and that the essential villain is not always a monster, but rather that human ambition in playing God, recklessness, and uncontrollable rage of a blinded mass rushing to lynch is true evil. But just an hour of the movie did not give us time to get to know the Monster, understand it fully and develop sympathy and pity for him.

65,ironhorse_iv,Frankenstein was & continues to be a monster hit. It's still alive!,8,28 October 2015,"Made during the American Pre-Code Days. The movie, Frankenstein directed by James Whale is one of most iconic Universal Horror movie productions ever made. I love the black and white Gothic horror romanticism atmosphere and great use of ""progressive close-ups"". It's one of the best-well shot, films. This is also the best-known adaptation of author Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus; which tells the story of a mad-scientist bringing a corpse back to live. While, the movie, Frankenstein is an iconic treasure piece from the 1930s & a lot of things from this movie was accepted methodology and appears in virtually every Frankenstein movie ever since. This movie also tells a much loosed story version of the book. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say; I wish it, was more accuracy. First off, I didn't like, how the movie starts, with actor, Edward Van Sloan playing Dr. Walden stepping from behind a curtain and delivering a brief caution before the opening credits. It really does, hurt the in-universe illusion. Second off, I didn't like his character, Dr. Waldman. In the novel, he only appeared in one chapter, his primary purpose to spark Frankenstein's interest in science. The film, he becomes sort of a mentor to the doctor, and even, overtakes, most of the scenes from Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive). It really takes away, most of the story-arch from Victor, now known in this movie as Henry. This was sad, because Colin Clive wasn't given much, to show, by. Still, he did, his best with his limited role. As much, as I like Clive, here; I really was hoping for Bela Lugosi to play Dr. Frankenstein. I know, they wanted him as the Monster, but I really didn't see him as it. Several disastrous make-up tests, proves that, and sadly, Lugosi left the project for good. Just think, how better, it would had been if Bela Lugosi co-star with Boris Karloff as the Monster and maybe Lou Chaney Jr. as his assistant, Fritz AKA Igor. It would be awesome. Anyways, one of the biggest things, I didn't like, about the film is how the movie change, a major theme from the novel. In Shelley's book, nurture is why the monster became evil. He only wanted friends, and the world treated him horribly for his appearance. In the film, nature is why he's evil. He has the brain of a notorious ex-murderer. Honestly, I don't know, why the movie even, bother to add this, because rather than using the more-cynical, depress, intelligent monster of the book, that would make sense as a murderer. Universal Studios version presents a childlike creature (Boris Karloff), who unsure of the world, in which, he was brought in. I really hate, that you really don't see, the story-arch of the monster's learning anything. I really wish, it was in this movie, rather than the sequels. It really was, missing that sophisticated complexity. While, I do like the naïve behavior of the creature from Karloff; still it doesn't come across as murderous, because there was no animalistic like behavior. A good example of this, was Boris Karloff's snarl, upon finding Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), Dr. Frankenstein's fiancée. It really sounds unintentionally hilarious & corny. His acts of murder, looks more like accidents, than anything else. While, Jack P. Pierce's make up for the creature's physical appearance, looks scary. He wasn't that threatening. I know, the movie was made in the 1930s, when violence scene weren't gory, but couldn't they make the deaths, a little more gruesome and not slow-paced if they were going with the murderous plot-point. I also didn't like, that some people really try hard to censor, this movie. The state of Kansas, alone, requested the cutting of 32 scenes, because, how blasphemous, they felt the movie was. However, two most requested scenes to be censored, were the scene in which the monster throws the little girl into the lake and accidentally drowns & the scene, where Henry admitted, how God must have, felt, when he create life. Upon its original 1931 release, some states cut the scene, right up to, as the Creature is reaching for the girl & muted the line, in which Henry spoke. This made the implications of the two scene much worse. Thank Goodness, those scenes were, later restored in later versions. One thing, that I really didn't like the movie, is the lack of score. It would have, add some much, to the creepy factor. I also didn't like the movie, adding the force happy ending. It really take away, from the powerful North Pole ending, in the book about compassion and forgiveness. However, the movie still has a lot of great themes, worthy to try to dissect, such as dangers of science and knowledge. Others, see the movie as a great discussion about life, consciousness, and the reason of existence. Whatever, they see, the movie is very memorable. Frankly, I'm shocked, how still, well-known, this movie is. The movie is so unforgettable, that, in 1991, the Library of Congress selected Frankenstein for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" Overall: This is a striking achievement in horror. A great watch. A must-have.",Frankenstein

67,tomgillespie2002,A true horror classic,10,26 June 2015,"Boris Karloff's monster in James Whale's magnificent horror milestone Frankenstein is one of the most iconic images in cinema. Originally a role set for Bela Lugosi after the huge success of Dracula earlier the same year, the image of the monster, dead-eyed with electrodes protruding from his neck, is once seen and never forgotten. The make-up is now industry standard for any Frankenstein production despite being virtually nothing like the one described in Mary Shelley's novel. But this makes it easy to forget that Frankenstein is also a great piece of cinema - Gothic, shocking and genuinely moving.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has locked himself away in his desolate laboratory in order to work on his grand experiment - to reanimate life and playing God in the process. His assistant, the hunchback Fritz (Dwight Frye), steals the a brain of a dead convict for the final piece of Frankenstein's macabre creation. His fiancée Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) is concerned by his lengthy absence and goes to visit her husband-to-be, and witnesses the birth of his monster. Repulsed and ashamed by what he has done, Frankenstein leaves his lab to be married, only for the monster, terrified and confused, to escape and head into town.Lugosi's withdrawal from the picture was a true blessing, as Karloff's stirring physical performance really drives home the film's themes. The monster at first seems to be searching for a father, or someone to guide him, and he reaches up into the light of the sky in wonder. It's only once he is abused by Fritz that he becomes violent, and obviously scared. Colin Clive is also very good, depicting Frankenstein as a man driven mad by desire and knowledge, only to feel genuine remorse and guilt over his actions. The film has been so influential that Whale's take on Frankenstein has almost become canon, with almost every adaptation that followed relatively ignoring Shelley's text completely. A true horror classic.",Frankenstein

69,poe426,Patchwork pariah...,10,6 June 2002,"One of the first and, arguably, the finest of the sound Expressionist classics, FRANKENSTEIN owes as much to its star as to its director: Boris Karloff evokes pathos as the put-upon patchwork pariah, and even Jack Peirce's fantastic, horrifying makeup can't hide the heart that beats within the breast of this undying monster. Colin Clive is likewise great as the driven man whose mad dream becomes a lumbering nightmare. Mention must also be made of Dwight Frye as the childishly cruel Fritz. Horror is, indeed, Universal. Mary Shelley would've been proud.",Frankenstein
70,filipemanuelneto,The film of the life of Boris Karloff.,7,15 November 2020,"Some films are more valuable for the inheritance they leave. This film, one of the most classic among the classics of horror cinema, is one such case. I don't know if it's really worth summarizing the script because almost everyone, even those who haven't read the novel, knows the story of Victor Frankenstein, a notable doctor and scientist who lets himself be obsessed with the idea of creating life by his own hands and using electricity to give life to a being made up of pieces of several human bodies. The film fails to recreate the controversial and morally challenging story, written by Mary Shelley in the midst of a snowstorm in Switzerland, and makes very little use of the original material. But it has the merit of bringing to life one of the most popular and revisited creatures in horror cinema for cinema, and of giving us the impeccable work of one of the actors who most competently brought her to the screen: Boris Karloff.Karloff was an anonymous actor before this film and I doubt if he was aware of the impact and the strength he was going to have. After all, Bela Lugosi himself, who was the great horror actor at the time thanks to the way he had given life to Count Dracula (another monstrous character with whom the Frankenstein Monster will meet many times, in several films), had ended to refuse the role of the monster! Karloff does the work of a lifetime in this film, and jumps into immortality. He is so striking that the following actors who brought the Monster to life basically limited themselves to copying the actor's work, manners and physical appearance. And all of this, be amazed, without saying virtually a syllable! The entire remaining cast was overshadowed, including Colin Clive, who played Dr. Frankenstein.The film is also a pearl when it comes to technical aspects, although it is not brilliant or particularly well done. The landscapes are outlined, all the scenarios are summed up to the essential, occasionally covered with artificial dust, visibly false spider webs and other resources that are basic to us, but were good at the time. Black-and-white cinematography works well and looks elegant, and the work of make-up (of the Monster, of course) and costume fulfills its role with pride and distinction.",Frankenstein

73,SAMTHEBESTEST,The First Ever Major Achivement in Sci-Fi Horror genre in World Cinema.,8,16 October 2020,"Frankenstein (1931) :
Movie Review -The First Ever Major Achivement in Sci-Fi Horror genre in World Cinema. Some of the major influencing and significant products came after the end of silent era and mostly in the 30s decade where we have pioneer of every genre. I just came to know that Frankenstein was first ever big achievement in Horror genre but then i realised that ""Dracula"" released just few months before Frankenstein which cannot be overlooked. Therefore, i say, Frankenstein is First Ever Major Achivement in ""Sci-Fi Horror"" as it blends scientific and human factors and not much of monstrous fictional tales. Well, that makes it highly realistic film if you really believe with the mindset of 30s people when many fake stories and ancient tales were global sensations. Frankenstein is about a sane doctor who seems to have lost all senses after his deadly experiments, he dares to tamper with life and death by creating a human monster out of lifeless body parts. The story could be called Groundbreaking certainly for Silver Screen ventures and yes visually appealing and humanly horrifying gesture takes it on high level. And guess what, it all comes in a tight narrative of just 70 minutes means you literally get no chance to move your limbs. Additionally, it is so interesting and engaging that even if we don't believe in the concept we are forced to believe naturally because it all comes organically and smoothly without any intentional and dramatic tricks. The actors are fine in thier roles wherein Colin Clive and Boris Karloff mostly take away all the limelight. The cinematography and art designing is generally attractive and the use of scary background score is chilling and shivering. All credit to director James Whale for his extraordinary vision and incredible execution while covering this Landmark Film to set benchmarks in this genre. Overall, an all time Classic Film which will not be dated ever.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Frankenstein

75,funkyfry,Boris Karloff creates the King of Monsters,9,10 September 2007,"It's always a treat to see James Whale's ""Frankenstein,"" mostly for the thrill of Boris Karloff's classic performance, the one that made him ""King of the Monsters"" for all time. It's also a beautifully photographed film with distinctive Germanic-styled sets that make a strong bass counterpoint to the linear contours of the actors' faces and the scientific equipment that makes up Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory where he hopes to produce synthetic life out of the bodies of the dead. The film-makers have combined material from Mary Shelley's brilliant novel with elements of the popular theatrical version by John Balderston and the story of 19th Century grave-robbers Burke and Hare to create a film story full of grotesque details colored by powerful pathos.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive; the name was changed from the book's ""Victor"" to ""Henry"" for no discernible reason, and the fiancé's friend is now named ""Victor"") is the one doing the collecting, along with his deformed assistant Fritz (cult favorite Dwight David Frye). Mae Clarke is his fiancé Elizabeth and John Boles plays a humorously straight Victor. It's one of those old melodramatic conventions, reproduced from Shelly's novel, where the ""good girl"" has a ""good guy"" but unfortunately is in love with the ""bad guy"", in this case Herr Doctor. There's got to be about a million stories with this set-up (I just saw one last week in ""Jesse James"", with Tyrone Power as the villainous lover and Randolph Scott as the ""more good than the good guy"" protector dude), and I find it one of the film's more conventional and weaker aspects. Also objectionable to some extent is Frederick Kerr's Baron Frankenstein, who's supposed to be the source of the film's humor but just does not amuse modern audiences  Whale improved at this type of humor in the second Frankenstein film and ""The Old Dark House."" The audience's sympathy of the monster is handled more forcefully and directly in ""Bride"", but one could argue it's actually stronger in the original film because of the relative subtlety. On an explicit level the film depicts Henry as a hero and the monster as a villain, but it's hard to imagine anyone hard-hearted enough to watch the film without pitying the monster. And a lot of this is particularly effective because of Karloff's profoundly dignified performance as much as it is the director's understated way of eliciting sympathy. First he's depicted in a horrific way, with 3 very effective close-ups of his face edited so that we get progressively closer to the monster. As long as the monster is captive in Frankenstein's castle he's frightening and dangerous, but as soon as he achieves freedom we start to see that he's only hurtful when confused or scared (something Dr. Pretorius makes explicit through dialog in ""Bride""). The scene with the little girl, which was edited in a particularly unfortunate way in the original film's release (cutting off the scene before he throws her in the water leaves the scene open to sexual interpretations not intended by the film-makers), is particularly heartbreaking in its restored version. Karloff does use some noises that emphasize the animalistic aspects of the monster, but his face shows so much of the humanity that the contrast between the two is both pathetic and vaguely majestic. He truly is the King of Monsters, because he has so much dignity and yet everyone treats him as an animal. It does remind me of ""The Elephant Man"", actually  the monster's plight connects with us much more than Henry or certainly his emotionally remote fiancé because there's a universal human element there. Physicality and mentality are odd bedfellows; rarely do they march strictly in synch. Unfortunately the story has, on the explicit level, watered down Shelley's contemplation in this regard by giving him an ""abnormal"" criminal brain, suggesting a physical determinism behind his more immoral actions. But the story's strength is only mildly diluted by this token explanation for a situation that is truly inexplicable; that is to say the fact that we seem to be angels (or devils) placed in the bodies of dogs, that our physical existence with all its associated bodily functions and dysfunctions provides the absurd counterpoint to our intellectual and moral facilities. And this really is the central problem in Shelley's ""Modern Prometheus"" fable  the question of man ""usurping the proper place of God"" is only a small part of this larger question. Since Whale and the writers have made the decision to make the monster incapable of speech in this first film, this theme is conveyed through Karloff's physical performance, one that rises to the level of the great artistry of Lon Chaney from the silent era. It's one of those rare performances where the effect is so powerful and iconic that it's near impossible to imagine another actor in the role. And it's something that every person should see, and not just absorb through the osmosis of public opinion and highlight scenes.",Frankenstein
76,Anonymous_Maxine,"`Crazy, am I? We'll see whether I'm crazy or not!'",7,16 January 2002,"James Whale's Frankenstein is a VERY loose adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. The spirit of the film is preserved in its most basic sense, but the vast majority of the story has been entirely left out, which is unfortunate. The monster, for example, who possesses tremendous intellect in the novel and who goes on an epic quest seeking acceptance into the world in which he was created, has been reduced to little more than a lumbering klutz whose communication is limited to unearthly shrieks and grunts. Boris Karloff was understandably branded with the performance after the film was released, because it was undeniably a spectacular performance, but the monster's character was severely diminished from the novel. James Whale's adaptation of the story of Frankenstein, while it is clearly and deservedly a horror classic, is tremendously less than it could have and SHOULD have been. There are unexplainable deviations from the novel, such as the fact that Dr. Frankenstein's name was, for some reason, changed from Victor in the novel to Henry in the film, and the film itself really only covers about a quarter to a third of one chapter in the book  that's how much has been left out. There was probably only about 5% or 6% of the full story included in this film, and I am willing to guess that the sheer magnitude of ignored material in the original story is at least as much of a reason that there were so many subsequent Frankenstein films (and Re-Animators and whatnot) as was the film's commercial success. This may, in fact, be one of those rare cases where the imitators may have just wanted to do it right, or at least tell the REST of the story. Despite the fact that there was such a huge amount of material that was sadly left out of the film, it is still to be praised for many different reasons. Boris Karloff, for example, delivered a wonderful performance as Frankenstein's monster, and Colin Clive was absolutely amazing as Dr. Frankenstein. The make-up, especially (and obviously) on the part of the monster, was wonderfully disturbing, and even though so much was left out of the original story, it was clear that the monster was not inherently evil. The entire portion of the novel that is told from the monster's point of view is left out, the vast majority of his unfortunate experiences and his responses to them are removed at the expense of his character, his attempt to get Dr. Frankenstein to make him a female monster so that he will have companionship is left out, and his fascination with the world he found himself in was left out as well (he read Paradise Lost just because it was interesting to him and to learn about that world!). I was also slightly bothered by the way the `criminal brain' was so often mentioned, because the monster was really a good creature that was driven to commit bad deeds because he was so badly treated because of his appearance. The book had so much to say about the way people treat people who are different, and that entire message is lost when we're constantly reminded that it's a criminal brain. The monster was reduced in that way to little more than a mindless villain, and the movie itself was reduced to nothing more than a typical horror movie. (spoilers) The scene where the monster is playing with the little girl near the end of the film was one of the few where it is actually made clear that he is just a creature that is unfamiliar with the world around him, and that he does have a heart inside him, regardless of the fact that it may have been dead for a while. This little girl was throwing daisies into the water, and she gave some to the monster to throw in, too. He was thrilled to no end, and when he ran out of daisies, he threw the girl in. He didn't know that she couldn't swim or even that she would NEED to swim, he just got such a kick out of throwing things out of the water that he didn't see the difference between a flower and a little girl. The rage that followed his unintentional act was one of the closest moments in the film where the misunderstanding of the world towards him was captured. Of course, I tend to doubt that Shelley intended the searches for the monster in her novel to be conducted by gigantic mobs of angry people all carrying torches and screaming at the top of their voices. This is not something that would be entirely difficult to avoid. At any rate, the whole movie has already begun to wind down at this point, and a death for the monster at the hands of the angry mob is invented for the film at the expense of the story. It is tragic that the amazing ending of Shelley's novel was left entirely out of the film, but it is also easy to understand because of budget and production limitations. This is an ironic and unfortunate example of a film that would have really been considered a lot better than it is if it were not for the book upon which it is based. It is clear that the film is strong and that it is well made, but when compared to Shelley's novel, it's really a pretty sad mess. The film by itself is more than able to captivate and impress, but to someone who knows the original story, it is a weak attempt to bring the story of Frankenstein and his monster to the big screen.",Frankenstein

78,A_Kind_Of_CineMagic,Frank-ly dated but still very good.,8,15 March 2009,"There are aspects of this classic horror which which may be termed as 'dated' and are poor quality. I am afraid this does detract from the viewing experience but this still is an important and, in many ways, impressive film. The faults are mostly explained by it being an early talkie where the required film style of speaking did not come easily to many stage actors/silent film stars or to some of the new faces trying their hand as film actors. As a result some of the acting is truly and hilariously bad. The dialogue too is hilariously awful, providing some really great unintentional laughs! This combination would make for a film only to be shown to give people a cheap laugh at film making of this period if it weren't for the many plus points. There is a lot of good stuff in this film which lift it to a degree where it can still thrill and interest new viewers to this day.The story is compelling thanks to the incredible novel on which the film is based. Some sequences magically bring the story to life with wonderful art direction/cinematography which gives an atmospheric, eerie feel and are candy to the eye. Some scenes, particularly where it is pure cinema without dialogue are great and a few of the characters are very well played, especially the monster. Frankenstein's monster is magnificently and movingly depicted by Boris Karloff. Overall still a deservedly famous classic but with flaws that cannot easily be ignored.My rating: 7.5/10",Frankenstein
79,FiendishDramaturgy,Karloff's most memorable,10,26 November 2003,"Even though in 1931 this movie was already a remake, this is an age-old classic. Done in 1931, fully black and white, this amazingly creepy tale still bears the marks of a genuine masterpiece. Having withstood the tests of time, I find this brilliantly directed portrayal just as darkly enchanting as I did 30 years ago. It is hard to believe that it has been over 70 years since this wonderful production was first released, but that not withstanding, it is a hauntingly beautiful, disturbingly tragic work of pure genius which is still just as compelling today as it was when it was made.In my opinion, this is also Karloff's best work. In this desensitized society, I feel honored and humbled to be able to view a movie of this caliber. When it was released, it was the scariest thing to be put on film. Today, there are gore effects, CGI, and a plethora of other mediums with which to shock and amaze us. Soon, the makeup artists of old will be wholly lost to the industry. If for no other reason, we should cherish these classics. Witness the industry when true artisans plied their crafts.The casting of Karloff in this part was the epitome of ideal casting. There was no other actor at that time, who could have contributed to this role, the darkling charm which Karloff demonstrated through this character. Of all the remakes done of this classic, I still favor the original work. The only remake which contains even the smallest degree of the magic of this original was the 1974 Mel Brooks parody, ""Young Frankenstein.""I love this movie, and even by today's standards, it still rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",Frankenstein

81,bsmith5552,It's Alive!....It's Alive!,8,10 May 2004,"""Frankenstein"" is the classic gothic tale from the pen of Mary Shelley that spawned a whole series of films based on the character of Frankenstein's monster. This film together with ""Dracula"", both produced by Universal, launched the popular horror cycle of the 30s. The film opens in a graveyard during a funeral. Laying in wait to rob the grave are the ambitious young doctor Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye). Frankenstein is experimenting with the creation of life. He has assembled a body from the body parts of recently deceased persons. All that is needed is a brain to enable him to achieve his goal. Fritz is sent to the university to steal a brain. Unfortunately he steals an abnormal criminal brain. Meanwhile, Henry's fiance Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his father Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr) and his friend Victor Moritz (John Boles) have concerns over Henry's mysterious experiments. Elizabeth and Victor enlist the aid of Henry's mentor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) to go to Henry's laboratory and try to bring him to his senses. Henry claims not to be a madman and decides to allow them to see his creature brought to life. The creature (Boris Karloff) is at first docile and kept in the dark. He is gaining knowledge and strength but is being tormented by Fritz. Finally the monster's criminal brain comes to the fore and...... This film is memorable for its tall elaborate set pieces and laboratory sequences. Director James Whale has most of the action take place at night so that the shadows and mystery are heightened. He keeps us in suspense by not showing the monster until well into the film. And even then the monster backs into the picture before turning around and revealing the now famous Jack Pierce makeup created for Karloff. Karloff in his first major role, plays the monster convincingly. At first he is a little bewildered at the happenings, turns nasty, invokes pathos in the scene with Little Maria (Marilyn Harris) and finally shows fear and panic in the final scenes. No mean feat with all of that makeup. Actually the part of the monster was first offered to Bela Lugosi in the wake of his success in ""Dracula"", but to his everlasting regret, he turned it down. Karloff got the role and the rest as they say is history. In an interesting opening, Edward Van Sloan talks to the audience, preparing them for what they are about to see. Van Sloan and Dwight Frye had also appeared in ""Dracula"". Frye again steals the scenes in which he appears. It has always been a mystery to me as to why this great character actor didn't have more success.

Following his phrase and a few more lines, he ends it with, ""Well, we've warned you."" Then the opening credits begin, and unlike some other horror movies of that period, it doesn't open with the underscoring of ""Swan Lake.""Set in an unnamed German village at no particular time period, a young scientist named Doctor Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), who, with the help of his hunchback assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), digs up a recently buried body preceded by a funeral, later fashioning the human body to conduct his experiment to see if he can make it come back to life. Learning of what he is doing, his fiancée, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), along with his friend, Victor Moritz (John Boles), and Doctor Waldman (Van Sloan) try to stop him, but to no avail. Frankenstein proves his theory to his skeptics by taking the body he has created, now lying on an operating table, and having the table raised through an opening in the roof during a lightning storm. When the table is back in the lab, the hand of the body slowly rises, with Frankenstein yelling those famous words, ""It's alive, it's alive!"" Time passes. Frankenstein learns from Doctor Waldman that the brain placed on the Monster (Boris Karloff) is actually a criminal brain stolen from his lab by Fritz. The Monster, in a confused state, is constantly teased by the unsympathetic Fritz with a fire torch, and because of this, the angry Monster hangs Fritz with his own whip. After the Monster leaves the lab and into the countryside, he goes out on his rein of terror.""Frankenstein,"" helped advance the career of Boris Karloff, who would reprise his role in two more sequels.

After throwing his last daisy, the Monster looks at his empty hands, holds his hands out and...(CUT to next shot). In the scene now restored, the Monster is shown throwing Maria into the water, and running away in a state of confusion. Also deleted but now restored is the scene earlier in the story in which Frankenstein, after seeing his experiment come to life, saying, ""Oh, in the name of God, now I know what it feels like to be God."" Those lines were taken out, leaving the viewer to see Frankenstein's lips moving without hearing words, but dubbed in laughter of hysterics.Unlike the future sequels, ""Frankenstein"" concentrates more on plot development, focusing on the leading actors played by Clive, Clarke, Boles and Van Sloan, who they are, etc., before it gets down to business with Karloff's Monster, which appears about 30 minutes from the start of the story. There is no underscoring to help it along, but plenty of extreme close-up shots on the central characters, seeing their expressions and wondering what they are thinking at present. The plot itself would set the pattern for future sequels to come. Also in the cast are Frederick Kerr (who lisps whenever pronouncing any word with an ""S"" in it) acting the role as Baron Frankenstein, presented here with some ""comedy relief""; Lionel Bellmore as the Burgomaster, among others. Although John Boles, usually likable playing devoted husbands in dramas or as a singer in light operas, seems out of place here. On a personal level, maybe David Manners, who played the handsome romantic co-star in ""Dracula,"" ""The Mummy"" and ""The Black Cat,"" would have made it work somewhat better as Frankenstein's best friend. Some of the dialog Boles in given to recite somewhat succeeds in weakening the strength of the story. Mae Clarke does get her chance to let out some screams in a classic moment where she is encountered by the Monster in her locked room.On and all, the original sound version of ""Frankenstein"" which has a successful run on American Movie Classics in 1991, revived on AMC from 2001 to 2002, and then Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: October 8, 1998), is quite memorable by all means, thanks to video and DVD distributions as well as Karloff's understanding of his character, but its sequel, ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), however, makes up for some weaknesses in the original.

83,strong-122-478885,He Played God And Built A Monster In His Own Image,6,21 March 2014,"""Fee-Fye-Foe-Fum!"" Even if you happen to be one of the world's most rabid/jaded horror-movie freaks ever, I'd confidently say that (for a mad scientist/monster picture) Frankenstein (which is now 80+ years old) is still a film that's quite capable of giving you chills & thrills that not even modern-day horror can satisfactorily deliver.Featuring some truly impressive sets, superb cinematography, and solid direction by James Whale, Frankenstein (which just drips with dark & gloomy atmosphere) is, undoubtedly, an undisputed classic gem of Gothic horror.Believe me, when the viewer finally gets their first look at the re-animated Frankenstein monster, this has got to be one of the most awesome moments ever captured on screen in horror-movie history.Needless to say, Boris Karloff certainly gave it his best shot as the tragically doomed creature of Henry Frankenstein's creation who was destined to be crucified.Loosely adapted for the screen from the novel of the same name..... Now, I don't mean to sound sexist here - But, it truly amazes me that such a story as this was actually penned, not by a man, but by a woman. Only 21 at the time, like, what could've possibly been going on in young Mary Shelley's head (way back in the year 1818) to have prompted her to write such a macabre tale as this? I sure got a kick out of this film's priceless ""Word of Warning"" opening sequence.",Frankenstein
84,ebiros2,Frankie Goes to Hollywood,7,14 March 2013,"Frankenstein is a many faceted movie. One aspect is the fascination to overcoming death. The other is the aspect of science's tendency to do whatever is possible without considering its implication. Even today, there are many scientific creations that are referred to as the Frankensein's monster. Another aspect is the monster's existence and the pain it goes through for being ""alive"". The movie brought forth all these aspects along with the new kind of horror that was linked with science. If you count the percentages of horror movies since Frankenstein that has scientific angle to it, it's obvious that this was a ground breaking movie. Mary Shelly called this story ""The Modern Prometheus"" which was a prophetic statement. Her creation Frankenstein, after a century goes to Hollywood, and becomes one of the best known movie of all times.The impact the movie had on its audience was obvious. Universal received letters saying that after seeing this movie, the sender of the letter had difficulty sleeping at night. There was a plastic model of the monster sold when I was a child, and I was horrified at the cover art of the box. It's a horror movie, so Universal succeeded in what it set out to do. It's still one of the scariest movie made.There's been many Frankenstein movies made since this one, but none has had the same impact as this which attests to its production value. It's the first, and still the best rendition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.",Frankenstein
85,ackstasis,"""You have created a monster, and it will destroy you!""",9,13 May 2007,"Arguably the most important horror movie ever made, James Whale's 1931 adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic 1818 novel 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' is both beautiful and terrifying, a film that almost single-handedly defined an entire genre for decades (though such a thing might also be said of Tod Browning's 'Dracula,' starring Bela Lugosi). Generally agreed upon to be the first science-fiction novel, Shelley's 'Frankenstein' was a shocking cautionary tale of the dangers of playing God, and a depiction of the influence of violence and maltreatment on the developing human consciousness. Whale's film keeps the novel's themes largely intact, the horror film specialist ensuring that 'Frankenstein' is not a film that we can expect to forget any time soon.Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), an overly-ambitious young scientist, is obsessed with the desire to create life, to feel what it is like to be God. Secluded in his remote laboratory, built within a derelict watch tower atop a hill, and aided only by his loyal hunchback assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), Frankenstein has been working hard to perfect his electrical devices, with which he plans to resurrect a corpse, painstakingly compiled from the body parts of dead people whose graves he has raided. However, when Frankenstein's experiment is successful, and life is created from death, the hideous, malformed creature (Boris Karloff), initially tormented by Fritz, becomes an angry killer.Though every acting performance in this film is spot-on, none received more fame than an English actor by the name of William Henry Pratt (screen name: Boris Karloff), who rose to extraordinary stardom following this film, to such an extent that during the 1930s he was often credited simply as ""Karloff,"" or even ""Karloff the Uncanny."" In fact, Karloff himself is unbilled during the opening credits (the actor portraying The Monster is denoted by a ""?""), possibly to fuel interest about whether or not 'Dracula' star Bela Lugosi had chosen to reconsider his decision not to appear in the film. Nonetheless, Karloff is credited with the role during the closing credits.The physical appearance of Frankenstein's Monster is not based upon Mary Shelley's literary description, but is rather the extraordinary make-up design of Jack Pierce. The preliminary design, with Lugosi planned for the main role, has been described as reminiscent of Paul Wegener's 1920 German film, 'The Golem.' When Whale replaced Robert Florey as director, Pierce's design changed radically, with the addition of the Monster's flattened forehead, the famous electrode ""bolts"" on his neck and a nasty scar where Dr. Frankenstein had accessed the brain cavity. Karloff endured four hours of make-up work daily, and even volunteered to remove a dental plate to give his character sunken cheeks.Even prior to the release of this film, people had been erroneously referring to the Monster as ""Frankenstein,"" despite that name referring to the doctor himself. In Shelley's novel, the Monster remained unnamed (referred to as ""the creature,"" ""the fiend,"" ""the dæmon,"" or ""the wretch""), as does he in this film. However, the title of Whale's highly-successful sequel 'Bride of Frankenstein,' reflects how widespread the misattribution had become. Many commentators have pointed out, however, that, because the Monster may be considered the ""offspring"" of Dr. Frankenstein, referring to the Monster as such may be acceptable.Keeping with the novel's theme, Dr. Frankenstein's Monster is shown not to be an inherently evil killing machine, but the result of abuse and mistreatment from the moment of his creation  though the insertion of an ""abnormal"" criminal brain may suggest otherwise. The most heartbreaking and haunting death in the film is the innocent drowning of a girl by a childlike mind, as the Monster runs out of flowers to throw into the lake, and so decides to see if young Maria will float. The title of the film does, indeed, refer to the true villain of the picture  it is not the Monster, but Dr. Frankenstein himself, who decided to play God, and so unleashed the horrors of the Monster upon the town. I only wish that sweet cinematic justice had prevailed, and that Dr. Frankenstein was inevitably killed by the Monster he so blatantly created.",Frankenstein
86,dee.reid,"""Frankenstein""",10,30 October 2005,"This is a real chiller. Directed by James Whale, it's a bold adaptation of the Mary Shelley story, and has Boris Karloff in the role as the iconic monster constructed from human body parts by a mad scientist (Colin Clive). As I'm sure with most conscious viewers, they could walk away from ""Frankenstein"" with tears in their eyes. Not tears of fear or joy, but sympathy. Because that is what Frankenstein is, an object of sympathy, not horror. He knows not what he is or why, and in the story, not the film, the mad scientist rejects his creation instead of embracing it. But you don't hold something as big as that against it, do you? Of course not, otherwise this 1931 film wouldn't remain a horror classic.10/10",Frankenstein

88,drqshadow-reviews,"A Short, But Unforgettable, Monster Classic",7,7 October 2021,"This rather loose interpretation of Mary Shelley's classic novel picks the bones of the source material before spinning off into something very different. Both involve discredited scientists, experimenting while in isolation, and their successful attempts to create new life from the broken remnants of several others. That's where the similarities end.The movie is certainly less intellectual, less challenging, with a tendency towards a kitschy, garish side. Doctor Frankenstein is more comically unhinged, recklessly dashing about the screen or pantomiming the shapes produced by his personal Tesla coil in a fit of exhilaration. The monster also differs from his printed counterpart, trading eloquence and ambition for a taste of raw, base humanity. In this case, I prefer the film's version: an articulate quarry with existential objections is less compelling than an impulsive toddler in a looming seven-foot frame. Or maybe it's just because this version is so incredible well-realized. Boris Karloff is a showstopper, and not just for the timeless, genre-defining makeup that's weighting him down. There's a sad, quiet pathos to his take on the creature, beneath the fiery temper and blunt physical presence. Even when he's at fault, he draws us in. We wish he were more present as the screen veers back to his tormentors, over and over again. But then again, maybe a larger bite would spoil the flavor.A risky take for its time, one that ran afoul of censors across the globe, Frankenstein is surprisingly well-realized, considering its age, and its morals remain both simple and profound.",Frankenstein

Definitely a classic horror film. The movie has a certain dreamlike feel in which events occur because they seem appropriate in a psychological sense, whether or not the plot justifies them. The Gothic set design is very imaginative, helped by the beautiful cinematography with suitably bizarre camera angles, and the music score is haunting, melancholy and atmospheric. The locations, all made to order on Universal's sprawling back lot, are utterly believable and realistic, and basing most of the film in tucked-away parts of ancient European country sides benefits the graceful aging of the film, since there are many parts of the world that still look just like the settings we see here. This film paved the way for how horror films should be portrayed. Certain elements such as special effects are certainly mandatory when trying to create the feel and visuals of doom and gloom.One of the best ""Gone -Mad- Moments"" in classic horror film history by Colin Clive.It's Alive , It's alive , It's alive ; Oh God !!

On the big silver screen Plus, I got an exclusive tour of the Universal Studios back-lot!",Frankenstein
90,MBunge,It's great!,8,21 July 2011,"In addition to being a true classic in every technical sense of the word, Frankenstein is also surprisingly entertaining for a film made about 8 decades ago. Yes, there are certain aspects to it that haven't aged well, but you can say that about most everything that's been around longer than 2 or 3 generations. There are also aspects to this movie as good or better than anything made today, earning Frankenstein its standing as one of the progenitors of the entire horror genre.I'm not sure it's possible for anyone much over the age of 6 to be unfamiliar with this story. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is the obsessed scientist seeking to usurp the place of God and bestow life onto unliving tissue. He and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) stitch together an awful creature (Boris Karloff) out of a collection of corpses and the abnormal brain of a criminal. But though Frankenstein succeeds in his experiment, his monster proves to be more than he can handle. It escapes into the countryside and arouses a mob of torch bearing villagers that traps both creator and creation in an old windmill, with terrible results.Just about everyone who's ever watched any film has probably seen part of the famous scene where Henry Frankenstein proclaims ""It's alive. It's alive!"". That's somewhat unfortunate, because taken out of context it likely strikes most as over-the-top histrionics. If you actually watch Frankenstein, you can recognize it as a definitely brilliant bit of acting that highlights an electrifying performance by Colin Clive. Few actors in the history of cinema have ever embodied obsession more powerfully than Clive does here, up to and including Frankenstein's almost orgasmic sense of relief when his obsession is finally realized. Clive creates THE archetypal mad scientist; a man who is not evil but whose pursuit of discovery renders him morally insensate and incapable of appreciating any ethical limitations.It is Boris Karloff's work as the creature that gets most of the popular praise instead of Clive, which I don't think is fair, but Karloff is certainly remarkable on his own terms. He's as much mime as thespian in this role and conveys a real mix of humanity and the unnatural. Those fundamental human dimensions are what distinguish the creature from the increasingly inhuman monsters that would follow him in horror films.This is also a beautiful film to look at. Modern technology allows filmmakers to stick a camera anywhere and do anything with it. Director James Whale had much less sophisticated technology to work with, yet was inspired by the things he couldn't do to produce some completely captivating images. With moving the camera being a challenge, Whale had huge, great looking sets created and filmed his actors largely in full figure as they went back and forth, up and down through those sets. It is a joy to watch Clive, Boris Karloff and Dwight Frye act with their whole bodies, not just their faces and parts of their torsos. If anything, the passage of time that had led to the relentless use of frenetic camera movement and extreme close ups makes Frankenstein look even better today than it did in 1931.Whale brings an interesting take on mob violence to this movie as well. In the story, the villagers represent the forces of law and society rising up to deal with the terrifying threat of Frankenstein's monster. However, Whale doesn't shy away from showing the ugly, irrational face of the mob. In Whale's hands, their actions may be justified but he makes the audience very aware of the uncontrolled danger that's ready to erupt from these men.As I mentioned, some of this movie is quite dated. The profoundly non-Germanic nature of this cast of Germanic characters is fairly ridiculous. Frederick Kerr as Baron Frankenstein, Henry's father, is a rather bizarre character. He's like a crotchety old man from a vaudeville routine and plays far too prominent a role in the story. Mae Clarke as Henry's fiancée and John Boles as their friend are also fine examples of the somewhat mannered acting styles of their era. However, Edward Van Sloan as Henry's mentor and Dwight Frye as his hunchbacked assistant are much livelier and more direct in their performances.If Frankenstein were 2 hours long or more, the dated elements of the production might have overwhelmed it. At just about 70 minutes long, the outstanding components of the story and its presentation are still able to shine. Even though you've probably absorbed most of this movie through cultural osmosis, Frankenstein remains a must-see.",Frankenstein
91,CubsandCulture,Even after all these years the film has an unnerving power...,10,18 November 2020,"I am not sure if the film is scary anymore but the expressionistic sets, cinematography, creature design all still make the final film deeply engaging and still creepy and unsettling. That coupled with the film's bluntness around bodies, death etc. make the film resonant with a lot of visceral power. The film feels antique but not dated. It is old and creaky but in a way that keeps the film fresh and striking.A lot of this has to do with the performances. Karloff's career was set because of the film and it is not hard to see why. He turns in a monster performance that is empathic, raw and just the right feel for the Creature. Colin Clive-who struggled with his own demons in his personal life-is unhinged, seductive and possessive. The two performances embody a dark ""romance"" between two diametrically opposite and yet intimately connected characters.The film takes quite a loose approach to the novel; several later adaptations stick closer to Shelley's ideas but I find the script compelling in its own right.",Frankenstein

The plot in a nutshell for those unfamiliar is Frankenstein is actually a scientist who has been experimenting to see if he can bring life to dead things. After small animal tests, he feels he is now ready to resurrect a human so he and his partner Fritz search a graveyard for a worthy body and parts. As everyone knows, his experiment works and his monster awakens much to his ecstatic enthusiasm. The monster can't speak yet manages to convey many emotions. So well in fact that during the story, you kind of care for the old lug. The film is rather simple and while not as scary today as it was in the early 30's, it is neat to see the pure frightening idea shine. Unfortunately, due to a brain mix-up, his actions are clumsy and imposing. Will the monster be able to blend into society?

After watching The Mummy and now this, I may be moving on to greener pastures. While this wasn't really bad, it was a bit boring and there was lots of stuff that didn't make sense. Most of the actors have American and British accents but during the entirely too long pre-wedding scene, everyone is dressed like a German stereotype. I didn't mind that when they were outside in the dark there was tons of echo, I know they didn't have good technology back then. At least they were able to have it really be dark, A feat that tons of later movies couldn't accomplish. But why do the ""mountains"" look like the surface of the moon? There's literally nothing growing in their mountains. The story itself is quite weak with lots of filler. I wasn't expecting much and I didn't get much. But the acting was decent and it looked OK. Four stars.",Frankenstein
96,MissSimonetta,The first great sound horror film,10,15 February 2014,"The 1931 Frankenstein will no doubt come across as primitive to today's audiences who are used to faster pacing and slick CG wizardry, but don't underestimate it. This is a film deserving of its classic status. It is arguably the most influential of all horror films, but that is not the movie's sole merit. We also have some interesting directorial choices by James Whale, great spooky atmosphere reminiscent of 1920s expressionism, and of course, Boris Karloff's beautiful performance as the monster which deserves every bit of praise it has received through the decades.That being said, there are a few shortcomings. The script has multiple plot holes and lapses in logic, and the criminal brain element is problematic. While most of the cast is marvelous, Mae Clarke and John Boles are stiff, though to their credit the roles they were saddled with give them little to do other than be concerned for Henry Frankenstein. (I'm also in the minority who prefers Clarke's Elizabeth to Valerie Hobson's in the sequel; Clarke may be subdued and even wooden at times, but she's never grating like her successor is.)Despite those issues, they are so insubstantial in the long run and some of them even add to the charm of the film. Modern film-goers probably won't like it, but if you're reading this review, it's doubtful you have such a prejudice against pre-1980s cinema anyway. If you have not seen it, then immediately do so.",Frankenstein
97,AAdaSC,Sympathetic monster,6,21 April 2019,"Boris Karloff is the monster as created by Colin Clive (Dr Frankenstein) out of various body parts from the dead.

It doesn't have enough tension and although there are a few standout scenes, more atmosphere could have been created throughout the film instead of concentrating on other story elements. We needed more Karloff and his demented ways. You've got to love the scene with the little girl, Marilyn Harris (Maria), though. Ha ha - a bit sudden! Still, he's a nice monster, really.

98,Cristi_Ciopron,"Classic only insofar it is ancient;yet not only of a historical interest--quite domestic and becoming,in its second part,bland",6,19 April 2008,"This version was conceived as an almost funny domestic bourgeois divertimentonot without merits, though, and execrably acted. All the bizarre clumsy charm of this modern legend was lostall the morbid decadent poetry of the doom. They were replaced by a domestic intrigue, deprived of all interest, and of the grim nihilism and cruelty of the 19th. century junk novel.Yet is leaves an agreeable aftertaste. If compared to his set colleagues, Karloff seems indeed a giant of the composition. He puts, indeed, a certain enthusiasm in performing his role. All the other actors are extremely clumsy and displeasing. I confess that I wanted to see the English novel, or novella, adapted; this is not the film to offer that. But it is interesting and even thrilling in its bourgeois domestic frame of mind; it begins more chillingly, it goes on rather tamed and blandly conciliatory. It doesn't seem plenty aware that it treats of one of the major legends (like the Golem, Dracula, Mr. Hyde, Fu Manchu, Vautrin, etc.).For my taste, the Jewish Golem is far more offering; yet Frankenstein's monster could of been fine enough.The (literary) great scene of the creature's coming to life is completely wrecked and hackneyed.",Frankenstein
99,rooprect,"If you've actually read Frankenstein, you'll hate this",4,23 December 2006,"This is without a doubt the worst film adaptation of a novel. Most people haven't actually read Mary Shelly's classic (probably because they think the story is as ridiculous as this movie), but to those 0.03% who have, I say RUN AWAY.Mrs. Shelly's vision was a profound allegory that entered on the themes of theosophy and the human condition. Her creature was never intended to be seen as a lumbering, mindless brute; he actually possessed superior intelligence, a love of the arts and literature, and above all, the simple desire to understand ""why was I created?"" But unfairly despised by his creator, he decides to seek justice. In the novel, the CREATURE is the protagonist. The ending is as unforgettable and poignant (to our own lives) as anything I've ever read.The movie ignores everything I've just told you about. Instead we get a stumbling, mindless beast who kills without reason, we get a dopey contrived love story thrown into the mix, we get an even more dopey contrived climax (the town suddenly goes wild!), and thus the entire point of the novel is mocked. Folks, it's as if I made a porno flick based on Romeo and Juliet. There are limits to how far you can corrupt an intellectual idea with carnal elements.The shameless corruption of Mary Shelley's novel is only the beginning. The acting is horribly overdone, the plot is predictably linear, and the dialogue is out of a comic book. And don't tell me that all old movies were that way. Haven't you ever seen M by Fritz Lang? People were NOT all idiots back then, and to say that this movie was an outstanding effort is an insult to the movies of the era which actually did hit the mark. FAUST by Murnau (1926) is another benchmark by which we see this film to be little more than an cheesy horror flick. How this movie got an 8.0 rating on IMDb is as baffling as how Lord of the Rings is IMDb's #14 of all time.On the plus side, the sets were quite magnificent. (Heh, that's all I have good to say about Lord of the Rings, too. Hmmm... maybe IMDb voters are mindlessly hypnotized by big sets. I must investigate this theory.)For some reason, the Frankenstein story has never been accurately translated to the screen. Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version was a step in the right direction, but... well... it's Kenneth Branagh (he should really be doing Broadway musicals, not movies). If any of you are familiar with the novel and can tell me of a good movie adaptation, please drop me a message. C'mon people, 200 years and no one has been able to get it right?!",Frankenstein
100,JoeKarlosi,Frankenstein (1931) ****,10,4 July 2004,"The film that made a major star of Boris Karloff remains one of the greatest horror films of all time. What can I say about a movie like this which has already had so many positive things said about it for over 70 years? It's a film that was actually scary to me when I first caught it on television as a child, and while it's not very likely to retain that power for adults, I'd wager that small children would still have nightmares after watching it today, jaded as they are these days.Beginning with Karloff, his performance is impeccable. He gave the Frankenstein Monster a personality and sense of pathos, but could just as capably turn on the nastiness when his creature was persecuted. The cadaverous makeup design by Jack Pierce is one of the most classic and instantly recognized masterpieces ever conceived; often imitated, never duplicated.Colin Clive is perfectly cast as the eccentric and neurotic scientist who stitches together pieces of dead bodies and endows it with life through the means of Kenneth Strickfaden's flashy electrical machinery. IT'S ALIVE...! Director James Whale mostly keeps the proceedings grim and bleak. Thunder, lightning, blackened skies,gloomy castles and graveyards are prevalent, yet occasionally Whale sprinkles his own brand of dark humor throughout the proceedings. He would go on to make BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, a sequel which in many ways outshines its original with heavier emphasis on satire.This is one early horror talkie which actually benefits from having no music soundtrack. One could go through the entire 70 minute running time and never even notice it was missing. Not anything like Mary Shelley's novel, but a Classic in every sense of the word just the same.

That's in large part on account of its existential, post-Christian theme, it being a rare horror movie that not only eschews the supernatural but fairly cries out against concepts of a caring divinity or an afterlife.No wonder the makers felt they needed to say something at the outset about the mistake Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) made of conducting his experiment ""without reckoning with God."" Clearly the idea is to put 1931 moviegoers more at ease, but this introduction, so wryly given by one of the film's actors, Edward Van Sloan, also pushes forward the atheistic theme the rest of the film will pursue less gingerly.Cooped up in a lonely watchtower set against a dark, foreboding sky, Dr. Frankenstein builds his own blasphemy stitched together from robbed bodies. Given life by lightning, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly gives Frankenstein cause to regret his creation, while sowing terror across the countryside.""Have you ever wanted to do something that was dangerous?""

It's this transgressive quality, both in the character and the film named after him, which gives ""Frankenstein"" much of its frisson even today.The chills begin right away, when we first observe Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz skulking around the edges of the world's spookiest cemetery, watching hollow-faced extras who look a few short breaths away from their own funerals mourning someone whose body Henry plans to steal. No middle-class moralist he!There's a lot of artful gloom in ""Frankenstein,"" part of it carried over from German expressionist cinema like ""The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari"" (Dwight Frye as Fritz, Frankenstein's assistant, performs a function here similar to Conrad Veidt's in ""Caligari"") and part of it the function of director James Whale and the others responsible for the look of the film; set dressers, special effects hands, and most notably makeup man Jack Pierce, who gave Karloff his distinctive, deathly look, stronger here than it would ever be again.""Frankenstein"" holds true to its hard tone at some loss to the picture's quality. There is little humor or light in this film, something sorely missed in a dated period piece like this, and the acting around Clive is notably weak across the board, except for Frye and of course, Karloff. It helps Boris that his character remains mute, what with exchanges like: ""But Elizabeth, you can't do that!"" ""I must!"" pocking the script. Clive does well, albeit with a character who is rather inconsistent, going all of a sudden from ready lawbreaker to civic paragon. In the denouement he isn't chased by a mob, but leading it.Though stitches do show in this somewhat patchwork creation (sorry, couldn't resist), there is resilient majesty in its greatest scenes, like our first glimpse of Frankenstein's face (three close ups, each moving further in from a different angle) and the dreadful image near the end of the father taking his daughter in to the village fair. Though I admire ""Frankenstein"" more than I enjoy it, it's still a powerful thing to watch.",Frankenstein
103,Witchfinder-General-666,THE Monster Film,10,20 April 2007,"James Whale's brilliant ""Frankenstein"" of 1931, starring the great Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster, is arguably the single most influential Monster movie of all-time. Creepy, moving, sad and beautiful at the same time, ""Frankenstein"" is an ingenious cult classic whose brilliance is only outshined by its sequel, Whale's ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" of 1935. Perfectly written, brilliantly directed, excellently acted and splendidly photographed, ""Frankenstein"" is the ground-breaking masterpiece that made Boris Karloff the unforgettable Horror-icon he is.I suppose that everybody knows the story of Frankenstein's monster, so I don't find it necessary to write a description of the plot. The acting in this movie is exquisite. Karloff is perfect in the role of his life. No other actor who ever lived could have fit into the role of Frankenstein's Monster as perfectly as Karloff did, and nobody could have played the role with such brilliance (allthough Christopher Lee was, of course, also great in the 1957 Hammer Classic ""The Curse Of Frankenstein""). Nobody else could have given the Monster this incomparable personality of a monster that is feared by everybody, but actually only a pitiable, sad, lonely creature in desperate and hopeless search for an identity and a belonging. Colin Clive delivers a brilliant performance as the young Dr. Frankenstein, who is obsessed with the idea of creating an artificial human being. And the rest of the performances is also great. Dwight Frye is unforgettable as Dr Frankenstein's hunchbacked, sadistic and crazy lab assistant Fritz, and Mae Clarke is excellent as the doctor's worried fiancée. The film is excellently written, brilliantly directed, greatly shot and highly atmospheric, and James Whale has to be described as a genius for bringing Mary Shelley's novel to screen so perfectly and creating one of the most important milestones in motion picture history.""Frankenstein"" is not a movie that lovers of film should see, it is a movie that EVERYBODY MUST SEE! In case you haven't seen it yet you should go and rent it, or, even better, buy it, because this is a movie that should be seen more than once and it shouldn't be missing in any collection! A true masterpiece! Absolutely Brilliant! A Must-See! 10/10",Frankenstein
104,Jonny_Numb,Mob Mentality,6,29 October 2007,"I have viewed James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" twice for academic purposes, and once for pure cinematic pleasure. And while many critics and fans will leap at the opportunity to hail the film's genius (or even champion it as the greatest horror movie ever made), I can't say I've ever been particularly impressed with it--there are good things to be said about it, certainly (most notably Boris Karloff's absolutely tragic portrayal of the Monster), but nearly as many distractions and miscalculations. The most notable flaw (which also afflicts Universal's ""Dracula"") is wandering too far afield of Mary Shelley's source novel, which took a more meditative dramatic approach to things (and free of extravagant setpieces like the lightning-storm ""birth""); here, the screenplay is derived from a stage production, and it shows--a lot of the soap-opera styled dramatics over Henry Frankenstein's (Colin Clive) marriage to Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) seem present to make the material palatable to a wide audience, rather than capitalize on the tense dramatic moments of Shelley's text. Also distracting is the character of the Baron (Frederick Kerr), who plays Henry's father as an endlessly drunk, nattering wino thrown into an expensive suit (the film's syrupy epilogue is made that much worse by his participation). All that aside, Whale has an excellent visual eye, cribbing from the German expressionists ornate, dream-like sets (conveyed through eerie long shots) and images that can be quite profound (the dazed father carrying his drowned daughter past celebrating townsfolk) and tragic (the extreme long shot of the burning windmill). There is also much strength in the performances of Clive and Karloff, their respective roles chipping away at the dramatic density of the script and winding up closer to Shelley's insights on human nature--when Whale seamlessly cuts from the Monster's face to Henry's at the climax, it is quite clear that ""the greater evil"" isn't so clear-cut. ""Frankenstein"" is a film worth watching, but I don't think I am alone in favoring the Hammer versions, which made the human dramatics synchronous with the over-arching storyline, and took themselves seriously enough to eliminate clownish roles.",Frankenstein
105,Steffi_P,"""I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy""",9,20 September 2010,"The 1931 motion picture of Frankenstein begins, famously, with a short introductory word, warning nervous cinema-goers that this was their chance to leave if they felt the horror would be too intense. Was this message, delivered by a chirpy Edward van Sloan with a twinkle in his eye, a genuine customer care measure, or part of Universal Studio's overt yet self-aware product packaging, which also involved crediting the monster with a tantalising question mark? After all, Frankenstein is not the most horrifying picture of the period, even if it was more so by the standards of the day. The Bela Lugosi Dracula, as well as some of the Lon Chaney silent horrors, certainly go to greater lengths to disturb and terrify audiences. Frankenstein features some creepy set design, spooky cinematography and one or two shocks, but it becomes more and more apparent that van Sloan's ""warning"" is in fact a canny and slightly tongue-in-cheek stunt which far from discouraging viewers, challenges their nerves and entices them to stay. Incidentally, Frankenstein was the highest grossing film at the box office for 1931.And that spirit of showmanship pervades Frankenstein. The adaptation contains only a kernel of Mary Shelley's novel, its central premise of a reanimated monster running amok, and then expands that kernel outwards into a new story of its own. Much of this was not invented for the film but was derived from the numerous stage versions, which during the 19th century had developed such embellishments as the hunchbacked assistant and the elaborate sciencey ""It's alive"" sequence. All this is now presented in a kind of cod-Germanic, somewhat Ruritanian realm and indeterminate historical period, which serves to give it an almost fairytale quality. This is another part of the theatrical veneer that director James Whale and producer Carl Laemmle Junior have heartily indulged in, without quite diverting from the mission statement of creating a horror.Let's look a bit more closely at Mr Whale's contribution here. An ex-theatre man himself, his approach to cinema was unique but highly inventive. His unconventional alignment of shots, for example beginning a scene with close-ups and ending it with a wide shot, is occasionally awkward but often brilliant. His roving camera movements are complex, but they do not forcefully draw our focus as Hitchcock's do. Rather, they gently lead us through an environment as if we were entering it ourselves. Nevertheless, Whale is a master of the sudden attention-grabber, suddenly throwing his camera into the midst of a situation at a key point. In short, it's a very pure cinematic technique, yet it has that quality of the showman, drawing us into the flow of the images and then suddenly demanding ""Look at this!"" And while Colin Clive's famous line ""Now I know what it feels like to be God"" was deleted upon release, only to recently be restored for the DVD, Whale himself is responsible for a more subtle bit of visual blasphemy. The shot of the monster's hand stirring to life is a direct parody of the resurrection of Lazarus in Cecil B. DeMille's 1927 King of Kings.Most intriguing of all is the cast of Frankenstein. Colin Clive, as the eponymous doctor, treads a fine line between a stark dramatic figure and an overblown theatrical one. Boris Karloff too treads a similar line between a realistic portrait of a childlike human and a monstrous horror creation. Their co-stars tend to fall either side of this line, either filling in the functional straight roles or presenting with overt caricatures. Of the latter we have that delightful curmudgeon Frederick Kerr, who always gives the impression of having just wandered onto the set and simply bumbled about unscripted. Then there is Dwight Frye, a creepy capering subhuman who has little purpose except to add another facet of weirdness. Frye is also the subject of my favourite bit of humour of the movie, in which he is present but not included as one of the ""three perfectly sane spectators"" described by Clive, presumably occupying a special category of his own. Typically of Frankenstein this gag is not drawn attention to, and looks unintentional.And this is the key to the Laemmle-Whale version of Frankenstein. It is an atmospheric horror, of a creeping, eldritch manner, laced with an oddball silliness which never slips into outright farce but prevents the genuine horror elements from becoming inadvertently comical. The makers of Frankenstein know that the picture can't quite compete in the thrilling or spooking stakes, and so wrap it in a cloak of grand theatrical extravagance, without ever robbing it of its dignity or its horror credentials. Frankenstein is perhaps the first open acknowledgement of the notion that watching a scary movie can be good fun.",Frankenstein
106,adamjohns-42575,It's alive! But it doesn't move with pace.,2,7 November 2021,"This is a very soft interpretation when you consider the more recent versions, but like it's Dracula counterpart of the same year, it still has a brilliance that has lasted throughout the years and set the tone of all of the ones that have followed. It scores slightly higher than Dracula for me as the original concept is better to start with anyway. It's another story that I think could be done a lot better, but is nonetheless enjoyable enough.There are some issues that would never be acceptable in a studio in 2021, for instance they could have ironed the backdrop. I've never seen a sky with creases like that before.There are also some incredibly hammy performances, none more so than Dwight Frye as Fritz but Boris is a close second and Colin Clive isn't too good either.It does seem a little rushed towards the end and not the clearest interpretation I've seen, but I wouldn't turn it off if I was bored and I prefer it to Kenneth's version, although Mr De Niro was brilliant in his role in that.204.85/1000.",Frankenstein

108,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Slight Issues, but Still a Classic",8,21 August 2020,"This was a film that I didn't actually see until after I graduated from college. I got the box set that had I believe all of the Universal monster movies and I decided that I wanted to check out some of the more historical horror films. I know the first time I really didn't care for it as I had higher expectations in my head. This is probably now my third time seeing as part of my Odyssey through the Ones. The synopsis is an obsessed scientist assembles a living being from parts of exhumed corpses.We start this off with a warning about the horrors and mysteries before it actually starts. It then shifts to a funeral. We see Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) are watching in hiding. After it ends, they dig up the body that was buried. They load it on a cart and as they are leaving, they come upon a man who was hung. Henry has Fritz cut him down, but they can't use his brain. His neck was snapped and I believe this is ruining it due to damaged to the brain stem.The film then introduces us to Henry's fiancée, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), and his best friend Victor Moritz (John Boles). They are both concerned for him as he has dropped out of college and conducting odd experiments in a tower. They decide to try to find him as well as help him.Henry has Fritz go to steal a brain for him and he goes to the college that Henry was enrolled in of the Goldstadt Medical College. We see Doctor Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) as he is lecturing on the differences we can see a normal brain as well as the abnormal brain of a criminal. Fritz gets spooked and the normal brain is damaged. The one from criminal is taken instead.Elizabeth and Victor meet Dr. Waldman to try to find out more about what Henry is doing. The trio of them goes to the tower on the night of the experiment. Henry is leery about letting them in, but there it is storming so he relents. They witness the success and the creation of the Frankenstein's Monster (Boris Karloff). It doesn't necessarily give the results that Henry was looking for though and the monster can't be controlled.That is where I will leave my recap and I have to say, I'm glad I've given this one a couple of rewatches. Previous to this viewing, I was able to see it on a 35mm print at the Gateway Film Center. That doesn't mean I don't have my issues still. It does capture that story though since the alternative title to the book was The Modern Day Prometheus. The idea of playing God is theme this movie is using, especially for the character of Henry. These are literally some of the lines he is stating as his experiment is a success and although Prometheus didn't provide humanity with life, he did provide fire if you follow the myth.Something else that really struck me was the monster and what happens to it. It is definitely a tragic figure for sure. I've made the joke that I didn't ask to be born and have to deal with life. I couldn't imagine being born into an adult body. It is trying to learn, but really doesn't understand and the power that it has, it makes it quite difficult to control. This idea really struck me after this viewing. The monster is really an infant in its understanding and knowledge, but in a body with great power. It is going off its base needs of food, water and pleasure here. The idea of him being tragic is reinforced for me.An issue with this film that I've been alluding to is that they really only seem to adapt half of the novel. We don't get any of the monster learning and therefore, we don't make him into the villain like the novel does. There is also the aspect of him being lonely and wanting a mate. That is completely cut out of this film and of course, the sequel. I just think this film is lacking by not having some of that here as I feel that is where the real tension comes from the monster punishing the creator. It also doesn't make sense as to the monster showing up to the mansion during the day of Henry and Elizabeth's wedding.I do have to say that the low running time does make this film fly. It might even move a bit too fast to be honest. A personal gripe I have with most of the Universal films I think that they really are just lacking a sub-plot or two that could deepen the story. That is something that is for sure here. Much like I said with Dracula after this most recent viewing, they don't even need to necessarily develop new ideas. Just using what was cut from the novel would help. I still think that the story we get builds to a solid climax and to an almost Shakespearian ending.Something that I do think that is good here is the acting. Clive is solid as the mad scientist. You can almost see the mania that he is dealing with trying to prove his experiment. When he finally does you almost feel bad for him as he doesn't know what to do with his life. It isn't the success that he though and the lack of control over his creation drains the feeling of being like a god. Clarke is fine as his love interest. What I find interesting about her is that she loves Henry and she has a feeling of dread of the events that are coming up. Boles is intriguing to me as he kind of a snake to me. He loves Elizabeth, but he is Henry's best man. He doesn't act on anything, but I just don't trust him. Karloff is amazing as the monster. He doesn't have any lines, but kills it with his performance to convey the creature. It is all done with body language which is on point. Sloan and Frye are both solid in their respective roles. The rest of the cast definitely rounded this one out as well.As to the effects of the film, there aren't really a lot. You don't expect that to be honest as this is the early era of filmmaking still. I don't love the look of the monster, but I recognize that it is iconic. I'm not entirely sure that they went with the route, but I'm not going to hold it against the movie. I just prefer more of a realistic look myself. The cinematography is well done overall for the era.Now with that said, this is definitely a classic. I like the story of the film and think that it is actually quite relevant even today. The acting really helps to bring it to life for sure. The film could have done with a sub-plot or two to possible deepen the story or even just including what was cut from the source material, but I think that the pacing of the film builds tension to a satisfying climax and conclusion. There wasn't much in the way of effects, but that is more to just the era it was made. The soundtrack of the film is fitting for what they needed, but doesn't necessarily stand out. I don't love this one, but I do recognize that it is a classic. I still feel this is an above average movie, but just lacking for me to put it in the good category.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",Frankenstein
109,Spleen,"Some good scenes, poor whole",5,24 November 1999,"There's no reason to complain about the special effects.  What special effects are required in a story about a stitched-together animated corpse, anyway?  Put some make-up on an actor, make him stumble around, and you've got it.  Boris Karloff did in 1931 exactly what Robert DeNiro did in 1994 - it's just that the monsters are in very different styles.  Oh, and there's also the fact that the 1994 film is much better.For all the striking images and scenes Whale comes up with I don't think he's really stitched together a film.  When and where is it set?  Parts of it seem to take place in Old Transylvania (perhaps Ruritania); but then other parts are set in the modern world (c.1931).  These two worlds can, of course, exist side by side; but I don't like the way Whale simply flits between them as strikes his fancy, confusing us for no good reason.Then there's the question of what the Frankenstein myth (forget Shelly's novel) is really about.  Branagh gets the answer to this question right: if we take the story seriously, it's about a single person's obsession with means rather than ends.  It's about Frankenstein.  Whale, like most people, think the myth is about two things: the plight of the monster, and science over-reaching itself.  His film does not (I was thankful to discover) contain the line, `There are some things Man was not meant to know,' but it easily might have.  Sorry - this version of the myth is simply risible. Ignore the personal tragedy of Frankenstein, and you ignore the most interesting part.  The day after watching Whale's version, I couldn't even remember if his Frankentein had survived or not.  (Does anyone know where I can look this up?)His fiancé, by the way, is a wan, floppy and irritating cipher; and we see as much of her as we do of him.The 1930s was NOT Hollywood's golden age, and many a film from that decade is exactly like this one: a pleasant, watchable dud with one or two classic scenes.",Frankenstein
110,alexanderdavies-99382,A landmark horror film and one of the very best.,10,23 May 2017,"""Frankenstein"" ranks as one of the very best horror films in cinema history. Scene for scene, it is virtually unmatched in its acting, direction, photography and writing. It's influence on the horror films that followed is unparalleled. In my opinion, ""Frankenstein"" overshadows ""Dracula"" as the former movie is a much more professionally made one and is a lot more entertaining. There is nothing I would want changed about ""Frankenstein."" I enjoy this film each time I view it. Boris Karloff was made a star overnight, in a career-making performance and James Whale sealed his own success with this film. Even though Karloff is fourth billed, he steals the film. He turned what could have been a one-dimensional character into one of great depth. Credit must go to Jack Pierce for the exceptional make-up that he created. It is interesting to note how different a film ""Frankenstein"" might have been if the original director Robert Florey and original star Bela Lugosi had remained. Their version would have been just as visually striking as the one James Whale made but a rather depressing film all the same. I doubt Lugosi would have bothered to create much of a performance, seeing as he wasn't very keen when offered the role. His screen test as the Frankenstein creature has long been lost but I am given to understand that his make-up resembled that of the creature from the silent horror film, ""The Golem."" However, James Whale intervened to replace Robert Florey - who wasn't very happy and Boris Karloff was cast as the creature. The rest, as they say, is history. Dwight Frye gives a very good performance as the sadistic assistant, whose untimely end becomes somewhat justified. Colin Clive is very good as Frankenstein - he is far removed from the more evil interpretation given by Peter Cushing. Edward Van Sloan is good but bland, as is John Boles. Mae Clarke is surprisingly effective as the love interest but Frederick Kerr as the elderly baron is absolutely brilliant! The running time of the film is only 66 minutes but what an enthralling 66 minutes it is! Screen horror would rarely be as good as this.",Frankenstein

112,sme_no_densetsu,"""It's alive! It's alive!""",8,3 February 2014,"James Whale's 1931 adaptation of ""Frankenstein"" is one of the crown jewels of Universal's legendary lineup of monster movies. Following close on the heels of ""Dracula"", the studio sought to repeat its earlier success and ended up eclipsing it, both financially and artistically.The story is of course based on the classic novel of the same name by Mary Shelley, though the adaptation is fairly loose. Ironically, the movie's version of the story is now more familiar to the general public than the original story.In a nutshell, that story concerns 'mad scientist' Henry Frankenstein's obsession with creating human life. He succeeds but the results are, in a word, monstrous.Boris Karloff's portrayal of the monster made him an instant star (and deservedly so). Without uttering a single word of dialogue, he gave us a monster that masterfully blended both innocence and menace.Apart from Karloff, the movie also benefited from solid work by Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein. His performance could be classed as over the top but that's part of its charm. In supporting roles, ""Dracula"" returnees Edward Van Sloan & Dwight Frye were a welcome addition.In the director's chair, James Whale shepherded the film with considerable care. What could have been a simple scare-fest instead retained some of the novel's philosophical underpinnings. As a result, Frankenstein's monster emerges as a tragic figure, not just a mindless creature. Special mention should also be made regarding Jack Pierce's makeup for the monster. The iconic look no doubt contributed greatly to Karloff successfully bringing off his performance.While ""Frankenstein"" may show some signs of its age it nevertheless holds up well even today. It was the first of many Frankenstein feature films and perhaps still the best. While some consider the sequel, ""Bride of Frankenstein"", to be superior I feel that the original represents an unmatched combination of horror, psychological insight and cinematic prowess.",Frankenstein

I can be sentimental about its affect on me in the 1970's as a child and recognise its impact on release in 1931, its place in history, but some of the acting is absolutely atrocious and Baron Frankenstein is the most ridiculous and misplaced character and casting I've ever come across.",Frankenstein

116,BrandtSponseller,Whale's First Masterpiece,10,31 January 2005,"After having been kicked out of school for his controversial work, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has been experimenting with the scientific forces behind the creation and perpetuation of life in his private laboratory. With the aid of his assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), Frankenstein finally tries his coup de grace--piecing together human parts to create a ""new"" life. When his experiments do not go exactly as planned, Frankenstein and his fellow villagers are endangered. Like a few other classics, director James Whale's 1931 masterpiece, Frankenstein, is one of those films that deserves to have every frame analyzed. Unlike most, Frankenstein is one of those classics that actually has had almost every frame analyzed. Countless theses and dissertations have been written about the film and its subtexts, so I can't imagine that I'd add anything novel along those lines in the space provided here. Instead, I'll take a brief look at some of the more straightforward aspects of Frankenstein that, in my view, contribute to its masterpiece status. The opening of the film has a very hefty dose of atmosphere, which continues more or less throughout its length. Although it was obviously filmed in a studio--the sky is a painted backdrop complete with wrinkles, this fact actually adds to the atmosphere of the film, even lending a slight surrealism. There is no score to speak of aside from the music playing during the titles, but the sounds that occur are just as effective, such as the ringing bell during the opening. There are also a lot of subtle visuals, and some merely subtly effective, such as the grim reaper at end of a long panning shot in the beginning of the film. The seriousness and realism of the grave-digging scene, complete with Henry Frankenstein throwing dirt at the grim reaper, is beautiful foreshadowing. As in the rest of the film, there is nothing jokey about this situation. Watch how effectively the actors convey a sense of toiling and franticness, how they convey the ""weight"" of the coffin. This is a curious fact about the film overall. Although the material is relatively melodramatic, and occasionally extremely so (especially in the case of Henry Frankenstein), the performances always come across as serious and realistic rather than campy (with the possible exception of a single snarling ""growl"" from the monster when he encounters Elizabeth, Frankenstein's bride-to-be). Contrast this to how Tod Browning's Dracula plays in the present day. In that film, Lugosi--although I love his performance--does come across as occasionally campy, especially in the close-ups of his ""hypnotically staring"" eyes. Even the one character that is meant to give some light comic relief, that of Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr), is comic only in that the character is a bit sarcastic, with a dry sense of humor. As such, Kerr portrays the Baron seriously, also.The production and set design, as in the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), adds volumes to the atmosphere and beauty of the film. The interior of the ""watchtower"", where Frankenstein's private laboratory is located, is reminiscent of German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and they both contrast and cohere wonderfully with the more symmetrical, right-angled lab equipment constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden.Because there is no score, the actors have no help in amping up the emotions in their performances. Despite this, rarely has either Boris Karloff's monster or Colin Clive's mad doctor been matched. Whale helps with some ingenious shots and sequences, such as the ""progressive close-ups"" when we first see the monster. He also gives us a number of ""stage-like"" devices that work remarkably well, such as the pans through cutaways in the set that in the film's world do not really exist. Interestingly, Whale has still had the cutaways decorated as if they are extant in the film's world. Although they may seem dated now, Whale's technique of fading to black between scenes also amplifies the sense of ""literary chapters"" in the story, and gives an effective, ambiguous sense of time passage between the scenes.Whale also achieves some wonderful, more understated scenes of horror in the film, often set up by contrasts. For example the severe contrast of the villager walking into the wedding party with his daughter, and the surreal bucolic adventure of the villagers working their way through the countryside to find the monster. Many younger viewers might have a difficult time watching Frankenstein if they are not used to black & white, slower paced, understated films with a different approach to acting. These classics are an acquired taste for younger generations, but of course it's a taste worth acquiring.",Frankenstein

118,TheUnknown837-1,I'm glad I gave it a second chance,7,2 May 2008,"When I first saw James Whale's 1931 horror film ""Frankenstein"", I think the reason why I did not enjoy it the first time around was due to the fact that I was expecting too much from a film seventy-seven years old. I was expecting something a little more serious, a little more drawn-out, a little longer, and then I remembered that that was not how films were typically made back in the 1930s. When I saw the film a second time, I enjoyed it. I still think it is perhaps a tad bit overrated, but I am very thankful I took the time to see it again, for I do now appreciate it as a horror classic.By today's standards, ""Frankenstein"" is very dated. Many audience members today may find the monster, played by Boris Karloff, to be more funny than frightening. I did at first. But when I pictured myself as an audience member of 1931, I could imagine the film being scary. There was a sequence in the film that I did find pretty intense and the rest of the monster scenes were just flat out fun to watch. The performances are very good, some of the characters are under-developed, but this is made up for by fine acting. Colin Clive was sensational as the somewhat mad and obsessed Dr. Henry Frankenstein and how could anybody forget the classic line ""It's alive!"". Boris Karloff also stole the show as the monster. Karloff did a great job with all of that heavy makeup and padding at making this monster seem frightening at times, and at others, strangely pleasant and even vulnerable.The monster is not always this fearsome creature that stumbles around going ""err! ERRRR!"" Don't get me wrong, he does do this and quite a bit. But there are some scenes where he is shown to be more like a confused, sensitive creature. There is a scene that is almost cute where he still retains some of his humanity and becomes friends with a little girl. In fact, he wasn't shown to be dangerous until provoked. I think a modern retelling of the story could examine this in more detail and with more running time to suit contemporary audiences, but the 1931 film does it fine in its own way.I do feel that ""Frankenstein"" is SLIGHTLY overrated and I wouldn't classify it as one of the best motion pictures of all time. It is, however, a significant horror film and I would call it a classic of that genre. Its limited use of a music score, great acting, and quick pacing makes this film a great means of afternoon or nighttime entertainment. I am so glad I gave it a second chance, it really is a great film.",Frankenstein
119,Stephen_A_Abell,"URGH! Urgh, URGH!",5,17 December 2019,"TheSTORY-1Though this takes the basic elements of the Mary Shelley tale I think there was a case of too many chefs when they started to bake this one. Though there's nothing wrong with it, the screenplay misses the morality tale. The closest it comes is the drowning of the girl... and they were going to cut the scene. It's this scene that makes the film and strengthens the story and the character of the monster.Another downfall was to make Frankie flat-headed. I never understood this and didn't like it back in my youth - I still don't. For me, Robert De Nero's portrayal was one of the best. Why the writers didn't stick to this image, which could have been more horrifying, I don't know.Then there are the characters, which at best are only shadows of Shelley's. Don't get me started on Daddy Baron Von Frankenstein... WTF!theDIRECTION-1I have to admit that I didn't like James Whale's take on the tale. The screenplay was taken off the stage play of the story and Whale decided to keep some of the stage play sets. The trouble with these is that they look like stage sets. Whereas Dracula was filmed in realistic locations, which made the film and story more believable, this has the opposite effect.There are a few, but too few, iconic shots. The best of which is when Frankenstein has reanimated his creation and his fiance and father appear outside the castle. The shot of him looking down on them from a lighted and barred window is perfect for the gothic tale. More of this would have strengthened the story. Whale should have used similar whenever the monster was on screen - making him larger than life and more threatening. This may have worked with the stage sets too.theTEMPO-1At it's best, the story strolls along. At it's worst, it hobbles slowly. This is another of those flicks that slowness and speed could have been utilised better. Especially in the stalking of Frankenstein's fiance and the destruction of his creation. There were times I found myself a tad bored.theACTING-0.75I know some people look fondly on Karloff's creature... but in the battle of the flatheads, I prefer Mr Lee's. Like I stated above, I wish the creature had talked it would have added a depth Karloff's grunting and moaning and screaming didn't. To be honest, I found his vocal talents quite annoying.As for the rest of the cast, well if you like melodrama you'll love them. Everything is so over the top it's cringeworthy.theGRATIFICATION-0.75This is not my favourite Frankie Flick. I may even say it's my least favourite. Would I recommend it? Yes, but only to the die-hard monster and horror fans - and only then if they hadn't seen it before.There's a reason I only remember certain scenes from this film, like the drowning, the rest isn't that good.theSCORE-4.5Pull yourself together and head on over to see where this classic horror ranked in my Absolute Horror list.",Frankenstein
120,Beta_Gallinger,"Dated? Maybe a tad, but nevertheless, it remains a significant part of cinema history",8,2 November 2007,"This 1931 horror film is the first well-known full-length adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel, ""Frankenstein"". It has now been over 7 ½ decades since it was first seen by the public, but it is one of those films that is still regarded as a classic. I must confess that I have never read the novel, so I don't know how this adaptation compares to it (some will compare this movie unfavourably, and it is apparently a lot different), but regardless, it has not failed to impress me.Dr. Henry Frankenstein is a scientist who is determined to create new life! He and his assistant, Fritz go to a graveyard and steal a corpse for the experiment, but Frankenstein discovers that they will have to find a useful brain elsewhere. So, the two go to a medical college, and after the class is dismissed and nobody is in the room, Fritz sneaks in and steals one of the brains. Unfortunately, Frankenstein is unaware of the fact that this is a criminal brain! Meanwhile, several people, including Frankenstein's fiancée, are concerned about the scientist and his experiments, so they go to his castle laboratory, where they witness the finishing of his latest project! Sadly, Frankenstein has just created a dangerous monster! As a horror movie, one would probably expect to find this movie scary. I'm sure it was considered very scary back in the day, but today, many could be disappointed to find that it is not so much so. This is understandable, as times have changed, and this film is obviously a bit tame compared to what is expected from contemporary horror films. However, I have now seen this version of ""Frankenstein"" three times, and although I have never found it very scary, I have still found a lot of it, well, intense, which is good enough for me. I couldn't stay fully intrigued the whole time, but overall, the film had enough intensity to leave me satisfied in the end.If you're used to contemporary horror films, filled with action and special effects, 1931's ""Frankenstein"" could bore you to tears if you're expecting the same from it. However, you have to remember the fact that it took a long time for film-making to get where it is today (it has obviously been a gradual process), and this movie obviously can't do the same for today's viewers as it did for its original audience. Many people today still dig these early horror films, and for those people, I would say this version of ""Frankenstein"" is well worth watching.",Frankenstein

In fact, by today's standards it probably wont shock or scare its audiences, but it will fascinate - which, if a film can leave you with an emotion, then job well done.This is the film which launched Boris Karloff into the mainstream of Hollywood horror. Not just into Hollywood, by on a yearly basis you will probably see kids dressed up Halloween as Karloff's version of the monster.

122,gftbiloxi,A Memorable Monster In A Magnificent DVD Release,10,21 April 2005,"Although I have seen better prints of the film, this DVD issue of Universal Studio's famous FRANKENSTEIN is a magnificent package that is sure to delight any fan of classic horror. The film itself has been restored for content, and the Skal-hosted documentary--which traces the story from Mary Shelly's famous novel through its numerous film incarnations--is a delight, including numerous interviews with various historians, critics, and Karloff's daughter. The bonus audio track by Rudy Behlmer is also quite interesting, as are the various biographies and notes, and although the short film BOO is a spurious mix of footage from NOSFERATU, Dracula, THE CAT AND THE CANARY, and FRANKENSTEIN, it is an enjoyable little throw-away. All in all, it doesn't get much better than this.As for the film itself, the production of FRANKENSTEIN was prompted by the incredible success of the earlier Dracula--but where Dracula is a rather problematic and significantly dated film, FRANKENSTEIN was and remains one of the most original horror films to ever emerge from Hollywood. Much of the credit for this goes to director James Whale, who by all accounts was deeply influenced by silent German film and his own traumatic experiences during World War I--and who mixed those elements with occasional flourishes of macabre humor to create a remarkably consistent vision of Mary Shelly's original novel.Whale was extremely, extremely fortunate in his cast. Colin Clive was a difficult actor, but Whale not only managed to get him through the film but to draw from him his finest screen performance; Mae Clarke is a memorable Elizabeth; and Dwight Frye, so memorable in Dracula, tops himself as Fritz. But all eyes here are on Boris Karloff as the monster. Karloff had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, and although he appeared in quite a few films before FRANKENSTEIN he never really registered with the public. But in this role, acting under heavy make-up, weighed down by lead weights in his shoes and struts around his legs, and without a line of intelligible dialogue he offered a performance that transcended the word ""monster."" This is a suffering being, dangerous mainly through innocence of his own power and the way of the world, goaded from disaster to disaster to disaster. Even some seventy-plus years later, it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part.Karloff would play the monster again in two later films, one of them directed by Whale, but although THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a remarkable film in its own right, this is the original combination of talents and the original vision. Truly a national treasure, to be enjoyed over and over again. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Frankenstein
123,johno-21,Classic cinema based on the novel and not an adaptation of it,9,20 March 2006,"Viewers of this film who are expecting it to be a screen adaptation of the Mary Shelly novel Frankenstein should be aware that this is three times removed from the novel and is based on a stage play adaptation of the novel. In 1927 Playwright Peggy Webling's play Frankenstein An Adventure in the Macabre debuted in London. The play was revived in 1930 in an adaption by John L. Balderson and Robert Florey. Universal acquired the rights of the play for a screen version and Robert Florey, Richard Schayer, Garret Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh wrote the screenplay. Boris Karloff stared as the monster in the stage version but the part for the film was offered to John Carradine who turned it down. The filmmakers took a chance on the star of the play and gave the unknown Karloff the role. Also coming over from the stage play was Colin Clive in reprising his role as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Mae Clark, John Boles, Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan round out the cast. James Whale was chosen as director. He had previously directed Clive in Journey's End and Clark in the original Waterloo Bridge. Whale would go on to make a couple other monster classics in The Invisible Man and Bride of Frankenstein as well as the musical Showboat among the films of his brief directorial career. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson, a film veteran from the early days of the silent movie one-reeler's, photographed this film. He would also go on to film The Invisible Man, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Another veteran of early silent films was Frankenstein's art director Charle D. Hill. Kenneth Strickfaden designed the laboratory's electrical props and Jack Pierce did the makeup. The result is an excellent film from the early days of sound cinema and not to be taken as literal interpretation or misinterpretation of the novel that inspired it. I've seen this many times and would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",Frankenstein
124,KnightsofNi11,A landmark in horror,9,9 February 2011,"If you've never heard the famous lines, ""It's alive! It's alive!"" then there is something severely wrong with you. Mary Shelley's classic horror story Frankenstein is one of the most memorable and remarkable tales of tragedy and horror, and James Whale's 1931 adaptation of the dark tale does it a lot of justice. Frankenstein is the story of the mad scientist Henry Frankenstein, who has set out to create life out of pieces of dead humans. He successfully plays God until he realizes that what he has created is an uncontrollable monster. Yet we the audience get to witness this ""monster's"" actions and it turns the story into a tragically human one when we learn that this creature is just confused and misunderstood, being brought into this world under such inappropriate circumstances.Possibly the most memorable scene of Frankenstein, other than the ""It's alive"" scene, is the scene where the monster meets and accidentally kills the little girl. In this short scene the humanity of this creature and the atrocity of trying to create new life in this way is brought to light. This little girl is not afraid of the monster and sees him as a friendly thing to play with. Upon this acceptance, the monster expresses its first true happiness. We see how he can connect with this little girl, only to have tragedy strike and we see once again just how detached this creation unfortunately is. The two throw flowers into a lake. When the monster runs out of flowers to throw, he sees the little girl as a good substitute. This suggests that this creature is capable of seeing beauty, as he equates the little girl's beauty to that of a flower, only with unfortunate consequences, as the child drowns after being tossed in the lake. Immediately after the monster throws the girl into the lake he realizes his mistake and runs off, expressing true human fear that sadly only the audience gets to witness. This event leads the rest of the town to believe the monster is a mindless killing machine, which leads to the tragic end of the film.Frankenstein thrives off of an aura of mystery surrounding it. The film is very modernist in its lack of detail and exclusion of certain things that we wish would could know or see. The ending of the film leaves two very important questions unanswered, only adding to the tragedy and mystery of the film. The film also surrounds its monster with a lot of mystery, going as far as to leave out Boris Karloff's name from the opening credits. Instead the monster is said to be played by ""?"" This film hones in on our fear of the unknown, which was especially effective in a time where the tides of war were upon America and there was a great fear of the growing fascism overseas. It is very successful in its building of fear and emotion in the viewer, even today.It goes without saying that Frankenstein is one of the staples of classic horror. It is very successful in everything it attempts to accomplish. It is thrilling, emotional, and meaningful, and its final moments will leave you speechless. Frankenstein is an astounding film.",Frankenstein
125,jluis1984,Classic Masterpiece,9,13 December 2005,"In 1931 director James Whale was a promising young director that was set to direct the adaptation to the big screen of Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein. After the success of Tod Browning's ""Dracula"", Universal studios picked ""Frankenstein"" as their next project, and with this, they would change the history of horror movies for ever.The movie is not a faithful adaptation of the novel, in fact, it covers only the first half of it (the rest would be used as the sequel, ""Bride of Frankenstein""); nevertheless, the film was a mixture of raw talent combined to create one of the finest movies ever done. We follow Henry Frankenstein, in his attempt to emulate God and give life to a body he made with corpses. As the experiment succeeds, he rejects the creature who is left alone in a world that rejects him.Many words have been written about this marvelous film and its superb sequel; James Whale constant perfection of his technique would reach a peak in his two next horror movies, but is here where it shows how brilliant his future would be. Following the school of German expressionism, it is notorious how different ""Frankenstein"" was from typical American movies, giving new life to the industry and showing that entertainment could Be art as well.The acting is top notch, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff as two sides of the same coin: Creator and creation, God and Monster; the powerful acting of both stars is pivotal for the movie to succeed. While the rest of the cast is average for its time, it is worth to mention Dwight Frye interpretation of Fritz, the doctor's assistant. His performance, while underrated, was on par with their costars and shines in his supporting role.Jack Pierce is the other name associated with this masterpiece, as he is the main responsible of the iconic image of the monster. No doubt his work was the work of a genius as his vision of Frankenstein's creation is the one that has go down in history as the definitive image of the monster.While certainly a masterpiece, it's incredible that the same team who did this awesome film would surpass themselves with the sequel: ""The Bride of Frankenstein"". This movie is among the most important films ever done,and a must see for everyone interested in film history, or simply willing to spent son good time.James Whale's ""Frankenstein"", is an immortal movie that will be always remembered rightfully as the classic it is. 9/10",Frankenstein
126,gab-14712,"Not Just a Horror Classic, But A Film Classic!",9,22 March 2020,"1931's Frankenstein is considered to be the godfather of horror films. It went on to influence an enormous truckload of horror films. Outside of 1931's Dracula, this film is the beginning of the Universal classic horror films that we have all come to know and love. If you compare it to today's horror films, it's dated and not all the scary. But to the audiences of 1931, they were very scared. In fact, the movie began with an introduction that warned audiences of what is to come. Something that you'll never see with any film really. In the end, this is a short, simple film about a man trying to play God which resulted in dire consequences.I said the film wasn't all that scary to modern times, but it really is easy to see the influence this film had. Frankenstein's monster is the traditional look that we all think of when we think about this story, and it's a terrifying look. Unlike Mary Shelley's important novel, the monster isn't really depicted as an all out brute. He his given some humanity with a hint of sadness. You get the feeling that he knows he is the creature that is not meant to be. He is not an inherently evil creature, just one that is taught the violence he will be known for.After the success of Dracula, actor Bela Lugosi was expected to play the Monster by producer Carl Laemmle Jr. Lugosi instead wanted to play Henry Frankenstein, so Lugosi was not involved with the film. Instead, Boris Karloff was cast. It's a good thing too, because Karloff really captured the essence of the monster. Did I mention that I like his freakish look. Tons of credit is needed for the makeup team. They did an absolutely amazing job.The project was directed by James Whale, a British director who knows a thing or two about horror films. It was definitely an inspired choice. He brought ideas from the German Expressionism movement. For example, Henry Frankenstein kept himself away from society in a dark, dank castle that looked very unforgiving in the midst of a stormy atmosphere. I also liked how Whale decided to get to the action immediately. No monkey business at all here which is great considering the film is only an hour and ten minutes long.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has taken himself away from society, with the exception of his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye), in order to work on his latest creation. People close to him including his father, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr), his best friend Victor (John Boles), and his fiancée Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) worry about him. They take matter into their own hands to intercept him. They discover he has been using body parts from deceased humans (including a brain from a criminal) to create The Monster (Boris Karloff). Everyone tries to convince him that what he is doing is wrong. The Monster escapes from their clutches and terrorizes neighboring towns.The performances, if not over-the-top, are really fun to watch. Colin Clive is known for one of the most memorable lines in cinematic history, ""IT'S ALIVE!!!"" It is unfortunate he died at a young age because he had a promising career. That said, the film's standout is Boris Karloff. He delivers a genuinely unnerving performance that will stick with you forever and one that influenced countless future monsters.The movie, while not overly scary, does feature an incredibly chilly atmosphere with moments of high tension. It's not hard to see why the film's producer wanted to start the film the way he did. Also, I thought the scene in the lab where Frankenstein's monster became amongst the living was a great scene. The special effects are really, really good. In fact, Mel Brooks used the same lab for his spoof Young Frankenstein.Frankenstein has influenced others and been lampooned a countless number of times because of just how popular it was. The famed creatures we know and love today has this movie to thank. This is a movie that gets straight to the action and is fun from start to finish. It's a classic must-own film for any horror buff or film fan for that matter. Thank you, Boris Karloff for your unforgettable performance.My Grade: A-",Frankenstein
127,juliankennedy23,Frankenstein... The brain is useless. We must find another brain.,5,25 October 2009,"Frankenstein: 5 out of 10: Frankenstein is a hard film to review. So much that was shocking in the film when it first came out is muted today. (Desecration of the grave etc.) As a standalone film rather than an “American Classic” Frankenstein leaves much to be desired.The film is very stagy with people exiting stage left and posing theatrically. The fight scene between the monster and the bride on her wedding day is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. The movie is quite short (running about an hour) and character development is minimal. If you real Shelly’s original work you are likely to be appalled by some of the changes.The brain is in the film is one of a criminal (Abby Normal) as opposed to an everyman. This changes a major component of the novel. In the book, Frankenstein became evil because he was rejected by man not because of some predestined nature. The destruction of Frankenstein’s family by his experiment that goes against God’s will is barely touched upon and the romance between Victor (excuse me Henry; they changed the name to Victor’s younger deader brother) and his fiancée is barely touched upon.While the vastly superior Bride of Frankenstein surprised with its effectiveness and advanced film techniques Frankenstein surprises with its brevity and staginess. But in its defense it is a classic and Boris Karloff is great as the monster.",Frankenstein
128,harry-76,Future Shock,9,7 May 2001,"Mary Shelley seemed to be expressing a warning to science in her ""Frankenstein"" to take greater responsibility in experimentation.Recent reports during the past decade of strange phenomena echo her warning: fish found bearing 'human teeth,' unexplained bigfoot creatures, bees that thrive on meat, puzzling unaccounted-for diseases, and the like.  Not to mention a 'deadly' viral strain of which no one knows the origin.
The 'accident' of the exchanged brains in creating the monster seem to symbolize the consequences of such unbridled experimentation-gone-extreme. Colin Clive's scientist seems more interested in ego-gratification than in making a useful contribution to humanity.  Is there much different today, in wild research and experiments which have dubious usefulness.  The mode seems to be to conduct the experiment first, then find its specific usefulness. This reverses the 'scientific method' of first establishing the void and then working to fill that limitation. 
Shelley's work was certainly philosophical, and James Whale's filmic adaptation effectively dramatizes her 'challenge.'  The monster's variable personality traits demonstrate the greater need for built-in safeguards to prevent resulting havoc.  Shelley's message is as urgent today as when she first penned her gothic polemic.",Frankenstein
129,SmileysWorld,The best ever telling of this classic story.,8,19 October 2002,"Oh,the many tellings and variations of this classic story.This,without question,is the best presentation of the classic story by Mary Shelley.

130,jem132,"Great, yet flawed",8,25 April 2006,"James Whale's classic 'Frankenstein' is probably the single most influential horror film ever made. Certainly it set the course for 'talky' horror, and all monster-themed films succeeding it.Not much of Mary Shelley's classic Gothic novel remains in the film. I can't recall any of the original dialogue being used, actually. This film is actually based on a hit stage version of 'Frankenstein', so we can't be too critical. Unfortunately, valuable and fascinating elements of the novel are blatantly missing here, such as the Promethean motif, the exploration of scientific theory and the class-divide that exists between Frankenstein and his creation.But why did they change Frankenstein's first name to Henry in the film? In the book, Henry Clerval is the name of Frankenstein's dear murdered friend. Here, we have a 'Victor Moritz' as Frankenstein's buddy. It's a head-scratching idea, as Victor was a significant name for Shelley's overreaching male protagonist. Also the addition of the brainless Fritz will leave most fans of the novel giggling with amusement.Let's look at what we've got here instead of focusing on what we don't have. We have Karloff, extraordinary in the role as the tortured creation. His performance is not just shock value. Karloff oversteps the gruesome make-up to create a sympathetic portrayal of a 'freak' that did not wish to be created. His incoherent mumbling and reaching hands say a lot more than any 'profound' speeches. Karloff would be known for this for all his working life.Colin Clive is camp and over-the-top as the scientist obsessed with creating new life. The lovely and unfortunately forgotten Mae Clarke, best known for taking a faceful of grapefruit from James Cagney in 'The Public Enemy', plays Elizabeth, the object of Frankenstein's affections. But the cast member(who only occupies the screen for about 5 minutes) that impressed me most was Marilyn Harris as Little Maria.In probably the best scene of the film, Little Maria befriends the monster at a lake near her house. She is the only one who can look past his ghoulish appearance and treat him with respect. We even see a smile from Karloff's creature as he engages with the little girl in her game of tossing flowers in the water. Sadly, he is untrained in the acts of man, so when the flowers run out he simply (and naturally for him) tosses Maria in too. She drowns.The impact of the viewer is pronounced. We are actually sympathetic for the monster here. He commits murder, but he does show remorse for his actions, and how was he to know what was right and wrong in the first place? Tragic.This isn't scary by today's standards, it's more atmospheric than anything else. The graveyard scenes at the start are a little spooky though. The film has no score, a device used to distinguish this early 'talkie' from the silent era. The lack of a score adds to this film. We don't need screeching music to tell us when we should be shocked.8/10.",Frankenstein
131,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Good monster movie, even though strictly speaking it isn't an adaptation.",8,30 January 2007,"The first screen rendition, with sound, of the classic book by Mary Shelley. A determined scientist creates life artificially only to face the consequences.As far as this film is as an adaptation, it could very well qualify as Hollywood heresy. There is a RIDICULOUS simplification of the metaphorical and complex original story. Really only the simplest themes presented in a rather simple way, all in what is today a meager 71 minutes. Even the names of characters and places have been altered.That said, it WAS 1931 when this film was made - that's 76 years ago in 2007! For being 76 years old this film is pretty good looking and the elaborate laboratory set practically gave rise to the mad scientist cliché. The camera work is pretty good and there are plenty of classic shots with shadows, fire, and many different types of sets. The windmill set is particularly intriguing and the fiery climax on that very location has become one of the most influential climaxes in horror cinema. And deservedly so. Stephen Sommers had an homage to it in his 2004 mega-budget monster bash ""Van Helsing."" Interestingly so, it is this Hollywood magic that has given this movie an aura that is just as if not more influential than the book. With the right state of mind when you watch this movie - the fact that it is from 1931 - you can really see and appreciate the rise of the Hollywood monster (movie).Also try to catch the uncut version which contains a ""shocking"" scene by a tranquil lakeside that was cut for the initial release. It's completely tame by today's buckets-o-gore horror standard, but adds some depth and perspective to how much ""horror"" has changed over the years. --- 8/10Not rated, but would probably get a PG for some tense scenes.

132,Atreyu_II,A classic of terror? Really?,7,16 October 2010,"That's funny, I don't consider this film minimally scary. Or maybe it's just me forgetting than the standards of ""terror"" were quite different in the generation of our grandparents. Anyway, considering the standards of the early 1930's, it must have been scary.It's not a bad movie. However, it lacks atmosphere and it could definitely use more suspense, to make it more intense and scarier. Even Frankenstein's monster (greatly portrayed by Boris Karloff), despite his appearance and the things he does, is not really scary. The things he does, he does them not because he likes to but due to a human error upon his creation which resulted in an unpredictable brain and character. I also expected the monster to appear more than he did, considering he's a pivotal character in the film.The disturbing scene when the monster picks up the little girl and throws her into the near lake causing her to drown is perhaps the most famous scene of the film. It has had a long story of controversy. The title ""Frankenstein"" always generates confusion, making many (including me) think it's about the monster when in reality it is the name of its creator.

This movie is a timeless classic that will always be good to watch for generations to come.

135,elvircorhodzic,"It's a monster, shoot it!",8,26 March 2016,"""Frankenstein"" by James Whale I looked several times. Although partly based on stories story is fantastic. This is a classic that even today does not lose its value. The distinctive image and a very good cinema are not unnoticed. Dramaturgy and stage design are very solid. The film captures their traits and elements of expressionist expression and psychological treatment of the central pseudo-protagonists in the character of the monster which is unforgettable starred Boris Karloff.Scientist will create a monster that will be ""his baby"". The monster is a reflection of science and experiments. The desire to create man sinks to the extreme. In this case we are talking about sick necessary. The man who wants to trace and sometimes cracked. The monster is an enigma, and people are wondering what it will do. People need to do something for the monster. After all it is the product of the human mind and hand. Monster, one put into life, will be treated in such a way to attack and their creator, it will attack the Creator himself through the image and likeness of his Freaks. It was awful, miserable, helpless, and hopeless supernatural strongly monstrous. It felt a tenderness toward the girl, but he kills her. It is useless, useless phantom whom the world rejects and prosecuted. I would say that acting variety, on a scale from excellent to good through dubious and bad. Boris Karloff (Monster) is excellent. Prototype of monster and character for which I regularly returned to this movie. The film has no soundtrack and hence its performance is even more meaning. Dwight Frye (Fritz), Edward Von Sloan (Dr. Waldman) and Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein) are all of them good in different roles. Dwight Frye is definitely noticeable. Frederick Kerr has brought a touch of humor, which is welcome. Mae Clarke (Elizabeth) and John Boles (Victor) have not thrilled me. Colin Clive (Frankenstein), no matter how controversial he was an actor in this film is inconclusive. Imperfection that gives off this big-screen adaptation of the story of the little Frankenstein moves us to watch over and over again, with a handsome incentive to experience the sentiment and nostalgia of the past time. This film is considered an absolute classic and I do not have anything to add.",Frankenstein
136,Son_of_Mansfield,"Karloff's monster is still very much alive, even after seventy-six years.",8,8 April 2007,"Boris Karloff's first lumber as the monster still packs a lot of pathos. The way he uses his voice and his face is still stunning. The monster never speaks in this movie, yet he is by far the most interesting character. That is owed to Karloff's subtle performance which has been copied, and paid homage to, in countless movies. A close second is Colin Clive's Dr. Victor Frankenstein whose passion for science blinds him to the danger of creating life. Edward Van Slaon, who would play Van Helsing in Dracula, and Dwight Frye, who is in several Frankenstein movies as a different character, offer support. James Whale is forced to put some typical touches, like Victor's annoying wife and friend that date this movie and keep it from remaining great. The lack of music is also odd and doesn't do the movie any favors. It's effective, as it would be anyway, when it shouldn't be there; but in the scenes where the lack of music is noticeable, the film is hurt. All in all, still a very good movie, but it doesn't hold a torch to the vastly superior Bride of Frankenstein.*Dr. Victor Frankenstein: ""Alive. It's alive. It's alive!

137,FloatingOpera7,Classic Horror: Frankenstein,10,12 November 2007,"Frankenstein (1931): Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles, Frederick Kerr, Edward Von Sloan, Dwight Frye, Lionel Belmore, Marilyn Harris, Arletta Duncan, Ted Billings, Francis Ford, Mary Gordon, Michael Mark, Paul Panzer, Cecilia Parker, Ellinor Vanderveer... Director James Whale, Screenplay John L. Balderston from the play by Peggy Webling.Based on Mary Shelley's 19th century horror novel, this was a huge success for Universal when released in 1931. Drawn from a play, Director James Whale's film would enjoy the same level of acclaim that Dracula with Bela Lugosi did in the same decade. Boris Karloff became a household name in horror along with Lugosi and unfortunately for these actors, these roles were the only ones they were cast in. Frankenstein captures the spirit of Hollywood movies at the time. The Depression was still on, radio and not television was the only other available source of entertainment and so audiences flocked to movie theaters to see movies with melodramatic and incredible plots (King Kong, etc) when they weren't watching romance or their favorite actors in either comedy or serious films. Not entirely accurate to the novel, this movie is built around Boris Karloff portraying the Frankenstein monster. Because this role is that of an overgrown, awkward, dead-looking, automaton creature, it was an impressive performance by Karloff under heavy make up and costume. There's no real need for him to act but even so, he plays the role with sensitivity and humanity in small subtle doses. Much has already been said about the famous scene in which Frankenstein plays with a little girl and is confused by the game she's invented and ultimately kills her. He is a big child and he wants to learn about the human world but it's scary and his strongest instincts are to kill. The thing is this same instinct is inside us as humans. The best performance is that of Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein. He is maniacal, driven by ambition and oozing the classic ""evil scientist"" persona. His scene in which he revives Frankenstein during a lightning storm is one of the most memorable scenes in horror movies. ""It's Alive! It's Alive! At last I know what it is like to play God"". This is the message of the film. Dr. Frankenstein has played God in resurrecting a corpse and the consequences are dire. Still, the novel is a lot stronger in this theme and a lot more haunting. This film is sensational and at the same time filled with ""everyday"" scenes in a village. The ending in which a baby is born in Baron Frankenstein's home is absolutely commonplace. The romance between Elizabeth and Victor is wooden and underdeveloped. This movie was a hit at the time because few movies had reached a level of horror at the time. But it's a classic and all horror film fans should view this as a valuable treasure from the early 30's.",Frankenstein
138,Prichards12345,The most seminal horror film of them all,10,28 May 2006,"How different Frankenstein might have been if Universal Pictures had gone ahead with their original plan of casting Bela Lugosi as the monster, Leslie Howard as his creator, and giving the director's chair to Robert Florey. Not that this version would have been bad - it just could not have equalled the achievement of James Whale in bringing this cinematic masterpiece to the screen.After the hugely successful but somewhat talky Dracula, Lugosi was an overnight star and Carl Laemmle Jr, the film's producer, found a quick follow up for him in this film. Out of copyright, he had Florey adapt an unproduced stage play which featured a far cruder and less child-like creature. Lugosi, submitting to a Golem-like makeup and shooting a test reel which featured him striding around the standing sets of Castle Dracula, lost interest in the part. At that stage it was little more than a grunting murderer, and he was probably right to turn it down, a decision which has brought him much criticism. But at that point he could not possibly have known that Whale would take over, and give the film a dark and meaningful spin through his own unique personality.And thus comes the monster we know and love. A child-like creation uncomprehending of the world at large. In a masterful scene Whale introduces us to him, lurching in through a door backwards, slowly turning to face the camera. Thus the world gets it's first sight of the movies' most famous make-up creation. Underneath the grey-green greasepaint so wonderfully developed by Jack Pierce (who had input from Whale) is the man forever synonymous with the role: Boris Karloff.Frankenstein is a wonderful film; the study of what it's like to be a true outsider, something Whale, always open about his homosexuality, understood all too well. Karloff is magnificent in the part of the monster - a genre defining performance, unmatched and unequalled to this day. The Oscar that year should not have gone to Frederick March as Dr. Jekyll...it should have gone to Boris.Colin Clive is also splendid as the nerve-wracked, tortured creator. And Dwight Frye is on hand as Fritz - another outsider who takes his bitterness out on the monster.The most famous scene, of course, is that of the monster accidentally drowning a young girl. Long shortened after a hysterical preview when Universal cut part of it out, it has at last largely been restored. The poor creature, having caused his new friend's death is utterly scared and grief-stricken. Once viewed it's never forgotten.In all this is a stark, powerful and moving horror film;time cannot shatter its genius.",Frankenstein

142,nickenchuggets,"""It's alive... It's alive!""",10,7 July 2021,"Ask anybody, even someone not very interested in movies, what some of the most important icons of the horror genre are, and chances are they'll mention Frankenstein. A chilling book written in the early 1800s, but mostly remembered today for the classic 1931 film adaptation. By modern standards, it has admittedly lost a lot of its frightening intensity, simply because many other movies have come out that are deeply more unsettling. Still, this film paved the way for many other horror movies afterwards due to its use of a monster as the main villain. It takes the somewhat realistic route, where the monster resembles a human being, but is actually an amalgamation of many humans. The story revolves around a village in Germany, where Dr. Henry Frankenstein assembles a body made from other people's corpses (many of whom were criminals). The body is completed, but Henry still needs a brain to bring his creation to life, or rather unlife. Henry's assistant steals a brain from a local school, but what he doesn't realize is that it's the brain of a criminal. After the brain is in Henry's possession, he invites his girlfriend Elizabeth to watch in stunned horror as the body is hoisted to the roof of Henry's tower during a lightning storm. The electricity gives the monster consciousness. At first, the monster (erroneously called Frankenstein by many, many people) appears to be calm and not hellbent on causing trouble. Henry soon discovers that it is afraid of fire, and the monster attacks and kills Henry's assistant. Henry must now lock the monster away and somehow dispose of it before it becomes a problem for his entire community. After being subdued by a powerful sedative, a professor prepares to operate on the monster, but it wakes up and strangles him. Meanwhile, Henry is preparing to marry Elizabeth, but the monster escapes and causes havoc, eventually dragging him to a windmill. The townsfolk set off in pursuit, armed with pickaxes, pitchforks, torches, and other rudimentary weapons. They burn the windmill with the monster stuck inside, and Henry is saved. Even if you haven't watched this, there's no getting around the fact that it's one of the most recognizable horror films ever made. Frankenstein's monster has become a very familiar horror icon, despite the fact that most people incorrectly call him Frankenstein. Regardless, there are many reasons why this movie is amazing. Karloff's performance as the monster is just unforgettable, especially when combined with the makeup he had for the role. Another thing I like about this movie is that it's pre-code, which allowed the film makers to get away with things that would be considered unacceptable today, such as when the monster throws the little girl into the lake and she drowns. That scene has been cut for a very long time and was rediscovered in the 80s. Also the bit where Henry says how he now knows how it feels to be god after the monster starts to come to life. A little known fact about this film is that it actually contains no music at all other than the beginning, end, and a scene where a band plays. In my view, the lack of music just makes it all the more disturbing. Truly, Frankenstein is one of the classics of the horror genre, and has stood the test of time for almost 100 years.",Frankenstein

Many thinking it would be played by Bela Lugosi the Dracula star.The fun thing about this movie's production for me and pardon me please, is the facts behind it, 1. Kenneth Strickfaden who designed the electrical effects used in creating the monster has come to be referred to in fan circles as ""Strickfadens."" It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one Tesla Coil built by the then-aged Nikola Tesla himself.2. Jack Pierce was the makeup artist who designed the now-iconic ""flat head"" look for Karloff's monster.3. Many don't know unless you have seen this movie or read the book that Frankenstein was the name of the scientist that created the monster, the monster was not named, but many started calling him Frankenstein and that later became the monster's adopted name.This movie would have been scary in the time it was made as sound only came to the silver screen in 1927, and then a movie about monsters came out four years after, that will scare some.The movie plot is about Henry Frankenstein who wanted to create life, he finally achieved this by using science and dead body parts from different corpses.After all the parts have been bound together to make a full body human like form, Frankenstein passed the body through his equipments and then the famous lines were delivered.""It's alive!

The scene with him near the lake with the little girl is ballsy and the people during the 30's had to have their mind blown.

I put it to you that they could not be more wrong.Frankenstein kick-started a short but unparalleled and incredibly successful run of monster movies for Universal, many of them based on classic literature. Mary Shelly's imperfect novel nevertheless contained an incredibly original monster and some powerful themes, and the creative team behind this effort have streamlined and adapted them with surprising sophistication. The monster design has long become a staple of popular culture, a fact not helped by Mel Brooks' spot-on parody. It is to the credit of all involved that the original remains so powerful, a fact in no small part aided by James Wale's expert direction and a star-making turn from Boris Karloff - here cheekily credited as a question mark. It is both Gothic in its aesthetic and minimalistic in its construction, yet surprisingly fluent for an early talking feature.The horror film has evolved a lot since, and not necessarily in a positive way.

149,tankace,"Iconic horror film ,which nowadays isn't as scary.",7,1 June 2017,"Frankenstein of 1931 is one of the most iconic horror film and many of the tropes we take for granted ,like a mad scientist in white,Gothic image, the hunchback sidekick, wild mobs and the look of the creature ,all of them have taken cues from this film. Credits where credits do to Boris Carloff whose acting really sell the film and make you believe that what you see is real, with his movements and facial expressions. Also the reactions of the rest of the cast help to the selling of the illusions very well.And the scenery is very well made. And here is were I will become critical to Frakenstein ,to the readers be gentle.DISpute the status of classic the film has(rightfully so) ,we have to be honest back in the thirties was scary but now it doesn't have the same impact as the next generations we have grown accustomed to it. To add to that scenes that ones scared the crowd now there are two reactions ,""wait I didn't get it?"" and two ""That was funny"". Also what hampers the film more is its short duration, clocking only one hour and a quarter, so the building up of the tension it isn't fully realized. Finally my biggest issue with the flick is who must it differed from the source material making it completely different from the original book of Mary Shelley. The ironic part is that the film was one of the starting points of Gothic Literature and the film similarly was one of the pioneers of this imagery in films. I am OK with the creating freedom for adaptations ,but after a certain point ,my tolerance is used up.In the end ,I see and I knew before I watch the film why it is considered a classic ,however this shouldn't make any product immune to well thought critic for its flaws, which don't diminish its quality, but show what to do better the next time.",Frankenstein

The horror portion, the drama and acting is often totally dated and cartoonish, but the scenes that are played for pure fright are so incredibly effective, I find myself reaching for it again and again. I think the credit all must go to director Whale. Drawing on his experiences in the hell of WW1, he successfully recreated in his images the fear and terror his senses were subjected to while serving in the British army. And thats saying an awful lot. If you are a true fan of Frankenstein, Gods and Monsters is a must see to explain this further.

152,dr_clarke_2,"While the word iconic is overused, in this case it is apt",10,13 July 2020,"Of the many film versions of Frankenstein that have been made over the years, James Whale's 1931 version remains one of the most iconic. Despite it's great age, it remains a truly classic horror film, even if time and familiarity have blunted its ability to scare audiences.
Whale's Frankenstein is based on Peggy Webling's 1927 stage version of Shelley's novel, which is why it deviates somewhat from the original source material. It also has a screenplay with four names attached to it, and which in turn is based on a story by John L. Balderston (who adapted Webling's play) and Richard Schayer. Film's that are so heavily authored are often off to a rocky start, but somehow on this occasion, too many cooks make near-perfect broth. There's no erudite monster challenging its creator's morality here, nor a climax in the Arctic tundra; instead, we get a scientist creating a dumb, childlike monster with a criminal brain, which is ultimately chased down by a torch-wielding mob. Such things are legends made of.
The success is mostly Whale's. Influenced throughout his career by German expressionist films, this is reflected in the impressive, gothic sets and is especially obvious in the distorted perspective angles of the cellar. The lighting is designed to cast deep shadows, which works especially well in the huge laboratory set, itself a classic in part due to special effects designer Kenneth Strickfaden's electrical discharges. The whole film is wonderfully theatrical: pre-credits, Edward Van Sloan (who plays Dr Waldman) addresses the audience and warns them what awaits; the Monster is credited as being played by ""?"" in the opening titles, which are presented over a picture of multiple eyes; the make-up worn by Boris Karloff as the Monster has aged well and makes it arguably still the most recognisable screen version of Frankenstein's creation. Arthur Edeson's cinematography is highly accomplished, most notably during the ""creation"" scene and again at the fiery climax in the windmill, and the first shot of the Monster's face is one of the most famous in horror movie history. The scenes of the villagers hunting the monster are impressively staged, a combination of the cinematography and careful editing.
But appreciation of Whale's art must not overlook the cast he assembles. Karloff doesn't just loom in make-up, he brings the monster to life with a part-bestial, part child-like performance that makes it a tragic creation, especially when it unintentionally (and still chillingly) kills little girl Maria, which results in it being hunted down and killed (at least until the sequel). It's hard not to sympathise when the creature is being tormented by Frankenstein's capering, hunchbacked assistant Fritz, who ends up paying the price for his cruelty (Dwight Frye is gleefully malevolent in the role). Colin Clive is perfectly cast as the obsessive Henry Frankenstein, who's demented cries of ""It's alive, it's alive!"" are as memorable the creature itself. Mae Clarke is also convincing as Frankenstein's doting, worried fiancée Elizabeth, whilst Frederick Kerr's Baron Frankenstein is a lovely character, even if he doesn't get a great deal to do.
Frankenstein spawned many imitators and many sequels, the first of which - The Bride of Frankenstein - reunited Whale, Clive and Karloff, and is if anything even more highly regarded than the original. But while the word iconic is overused, in this case it is apt: the film remains a true classic, not just of the horror genre, but of American cinema as a whole.",Frankenstein

⚪
All in all, this beloved classic might be a milestone in the genre of horror films and tremendously shaped the genre as we know it today, but other than that it didn't really manage to revive the inanimate matter of Mary Shelly's bone-chilling gothic fiction novel and instead becomes something that has nothing to do with it in the slightest. After weeks I have finally had the time to finish my latest novel, one that was both exhausting and fascinating at the same time. Unlike this film, it is the story of a man who perishes thanks to his own hybris and desperately tries to stop the fiend he has unleashed on the world. Seriously, at times it was hard to read, not because it was sophisticated in the writing style but bad for my mental health, as Shelly majorly describes Victor's depression so in detail that it hurt. Aside from this, it was also a piece of social criticism that analyses the thirst for knowledge of scientists who cannot get enough and underestimate the consequences of their actions. That is why I am a little disappointed with this adaptation. I have already seen it five years ago, without any knowledge about the source material and hence found it quite entertaining, but now that I have read the book I cannot help but realising major issues that are upsetting me a lot. At most, only five percent of the brilliant piece of literature were taken into account and most of it was added by the screenwriters. I couldn't recognize the excellent story at all and was confronted with something totally altered. Why would you do that with such a magnificent source? To be honest, I have a strong feeling that I know the answer to that difficult question, and I dislike it a lot. Even if it was common at that time, I couldn't help but realising that Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is only listed in the credits as ""Mrs. Percy Shelley"" and I consider this to be infuriating for many reasons. First of all, the brilliant lady behind the classic novel is only mentioned degraded as the wife of a man and not for herself, even though it has been known for roughly one-hundred years that it was written by a woman. Why would they not give her credit properly? This small detail and the totally disfigured story of the film indicated and gave me the strong feeling that the men who produced this film simply refused to acknowledge the genius, the product and intelligence of a woman. What makes me think that way? Just look at the plot and story. None of the characters, except for Elizabeth maybe, is as described in the novel, and except for the infamous reanimation scene none of the scenes in this film originated from the book. No complex conflict of the actions and immoral behaviour of a haunted man, not in the slightest. Oh, and have I mentioned that the novel was almost exclusively adapted by men? I cannot help but having the strong feeling that they just didn't want to honour her achievement. Even if that is just my personal overreaction, it isn't a masterful film either. The acting is cringe worthy and wooden and the dialogue absolutely cheesy (the same applies to the attempt to include the German language aspect). Boris Karloff's legendary performance as the creature is maybe the one aspect that saves it from being below mediocrity, but that is it already. In the end, it has undoubtedly aged terribly and didn't do it source material justice in the slightest, but I can imagine that it was the horror for people back in the day. But to me, someone who has read the original novel that came out more than hundred years prior (so don't tell me that the people probably would not have been able to deal with the subject matter), it was sadly disappointing upon a re-watch. It simply isn't the detailed essay on the mind and misery of a man who dared to play god, hence I only bestow it this rating for the impact it had and the importance it has to the horror genre.",Frankenstein

156,ReelCheese,Classic Tale,8,11 May 2006,"Though not as spectacular as one would expect of such a classic, this loose interpretation of Mary Shelley's oft-told tale delivers. The familiar story focuses on Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the reclusive, stereotypical mad scientist obsessed with creating new life from stitched-together corpses. But something goes terribly wrong when the brain he uses turns out to be that of a criminal. The film starts out slow but redeems itself with time, particularly the windmill climax scene that by 1931 standards is nothing short of stellar. In one of filmdom's all-time great performances, Boris Karloff plays the monster as a sort of tragic figure unable to comprehend right from wrong, and the audience is left feeling more sympathetic than frightened by him.",Frankenstein

158,happyendingrocks,"Nearly a century later, it's still alive",9,28 October 2009,"Though not as nuanced or intricate as Mary Shelley's source novel, this early Universal monster masterpiece is a relatively faithful telling of her masterfully macabre tale that holds up admirably under modern scrutiny. So many films have referenced Frankenstein that many of its more powerful elements may be lost on viewers discovering it for the first time today, but age has not diluted this classy production, or dulled the most potent of its indelible visuals.Universal's earliest monster outings were constructed much like the dramatic and noir flagstones that propelled the studio into greatness. In essence, they were Gothic stage plays captured on film, using strong acting and atmospherics to stimulate terror where the primitive special effects capabilities of the era could not. Frankenstein is crafted with this same approach, and one of the reasons it has aged so well is because it was developed with a sense of timelessness that befits the timeless nature of the source material.The locations, all made to order on Universal's sprawling backlot, are utterly believable and realistic, and basing most of the film in tucked-away parts of ancient European countrysides benefits the graceful aging of the film, since there are many parts of the world that still look just like the settings we see here.The massive castle sets, particularly Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, are still impressive by modern standards, and though we now have more sophisticated toys than those seen in the lab, the devices in the doctor's dwelling are far more than elaborate set decoration. Each apparatus looks functional and logical, and though most of us have never tried to re-animate a corpse in our basement, we have to concede that the machines we'd need to do so would probably look and work just like the ones we see humming in the house of Frankenstein.Surely, no one reading this has managed to go their whole lives without seeing the iconic image of Boris Karloff's amazingly realized monster. But seeing him in action is another matter altogether, and even stifled under the unforgettable make-up, Karloff gives a brilliant performance as the tragic and misunderstood creature struggling to comprehend its existence after being spurned by its creator. The range of emotions Karloff conveys is astounding, especially considering that he doesn't have a single line in the film, and we surely empathize with the horrid reality of this damned creation as it uncovers each curse brought on by its unnatural birth. The make-up remains truly stunning, and the first time Frankenstein's monster steps into frame is still one of the most powerful and haunting images to ever grace a horror film.Ditto with the controversial drowning scene, which was edited from the film at various points of its history. Those seeing this sequence for the first time may be surprised that such a brief display was deemed so controversial in its day, but the stark simplicity of the image, and the horror that is implied rather than shown, shape an unforgettable scene that is crucial in driving the film to its climax. When the drowned girl's father later carries her limp and battered body down the street, the mourning and furious emptiness in his eyes is one of the film's most compelling images, as it perhaps most completely essays the outrageous evil of Dr. Frankenstein's horrific work.Those not used to classic movies may have trouble acclimating to the film's style, but the rewards of Frankenstein far outweigh any discomfort of adjustment, and there are a multitude of reasons this cinematic landmark has endured the way it has. For anyone who has yet to discover those reasons for themselves, consider your horror acumen woefully malnourished until you've added this certified classic to your library.",Frankenstein
159,quaseprovisorio,"very well filmed, an historical landmark but i prefer the invisible man.",7,5 July 2020,"From a tecnical standpoint this is a great piece. The cinematography is perfect. the opposition between dark and light is very amazing to watch. almost all the scenes are beautifully filmed and there are plenty of memorable frames and shots here. the way the movie manages frankensten's laboratory to be a scary daring place is still mesmerizing. even the make up and characterization of the monster are top notch.the movie flows well too. it's obviously an historical piece and deserves because it is beautiful to watch its black and white images. my problem here is about how the film chooses to be an horror piece. i would prefer less characters. i think if the movie was set almost solely on frankenstein's laboratory could have been perfect. no family, no father. a lover? sure. but not so many people on screen. i know this was an adaptation of mary shelley but...again, it's an adaptation.i can't avoid to compare this with ""the invisible man"" - which i think is a better film.because it has all the same techniques brilliantly applied, the same philosophical questions - at what point can men go to subvert their own mortality, how far are they willing to reach in order to become canons, do we allow science going too far just to fulfill the pretense of some men to become bigger than themselves? at what cost? - but that one has a slasher feel i felt it was lacking here. plus frankenstein's character doesn't seem as mad as jack griffin.it's easier to root for him. and that makes this film for me one step below the invisible man. of course, historically is probably more relevant: this is one of the utmost untouchable monster films. maybe the most known monster film ever. but what i think we have to praise above all is the genious of the director james whale. because he films the hell out of this. without him i think this movie would have been way easier forgotten. but because he filmed this with such a great ability it became an unforgettable experience.i would just prefer a less ""family"" film and a more ""guy in a laboratory in the middle of nowhere"" film. but it's obviously a must watch. for everyone.",Frankenstein

161,PCC0921,An Example of An Early Franchise Being Born,9,9 January 2021,"About 10 months after the release of Tod Browning's Dracula (1931), Universal Pictures would score again. With this new venture, they would launch one of the greatest and earliest film franchises, when Frankenstein (1931), with then, barely known, Boris Karloff, hits the theaters. Just like Dracula (1931), I also had about 20 minutes of Frankenstein on Super-8 film as a kid and was exposed to both films a lot on late night syndication channels and Saturday afternoon Creature Feature shows, all through the 70s and early 80s. I also saw it numerous times in it's entirety on VHS and DVD since then. So, I have seen this film a lot.Say what you want about Boris Karloff. How the gentle giant pulled off a great Frankenstein Monster and how his likeness is now one of the most recognizable pop-cultural icons in the world, even 45 years later after his death, says a lot about his impact. Say what you want about Dwight Frye, who for my money did a great job as Fritz, the hunch-backed assistant in this movie, even better than his portrayal of Renfield in Dracula (1931). Even Edward Van Sloan, who in my opinion, was the best part about Dracula (1931), is also a key player in this film. Even Frederick Kerr, who was a scene stealer as Baron Frankenstein, made this a fun film to enjoy with his off the cuff, almost ad-libbed dialogue, but it was the man who played the son of the Baron, Henry Frankenstein, that stole the whole show.Remember, the movie is about a man named Frankenstein, who builds a monster from the parts of dead victims. It is actually his movie, not the Monster's, not Karloff's, but Colin Clive's (Henry Frankenstein), movie. Clive gives a supreme performance and manages to harness the power needed for that character to thrive with perfection. His disclosure of what philosophy drives him to do what he does establishes a politically and spiritually charged tone that is quite evident throughout the entire film. Topics like playing God or is the human being truly higher than any other animal? What is really the difference between life or death?James Whale's directing is dead on and he manages to capture the horror and frights by inserting an almost ""noir"" feeling in the mix. Close ups, lighting and mood all play into an almost perfect film. It is very easy to see certain mistakes, continuity issues and primitive technical mishaps in a film that is 90 years old, but at the time, this film was a box office smash.It had the impact on a 1931 audience like the Avengers had on a 2012 audience. This was something movie-goers had never seen before. It WAS the embodiment of state of the art technical achievement in film. The make-up, costumes, sets and special effects were the premiere version of the period and, because of that, it demands the respect that it deserves, just like the kind of respect that Henry Frankenstein was searching for. This film should be studied, because as we will see in the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), for Henry Frankenstein and Colin Clive, life will never be the same after Frankenstein.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",Frankenstein
162,Chance2000esl,"Not the Book, But a Beautifully Crafted Film!",8,27 October 2007,"If you've read the magnificent, poignant ""Frankenstein"" (1818) by Mary Wollestonecraft (probably heavily rewritten by Percy Shelly), which is really an allegory about how we, the created from the parts of others (our parents), are brought without our consent into a world of brutality that may treat us cruelly, you'll be totally offended by the liberties that this film, and its sequel, 'The Bride of Frankenstein' (1935) take with the original work. It has too much that is not in the book, and in at least one case (the use of the 'abnormal brain' as a cause for the Monster's cruelty) contradicts the book's theme of one born innocent responding to the world's cruelty with cruelty. None of this is James Whale's fault, as the great DVD commentary in Universal's Legacy Collection explains, since there were so many different plays and sources from which the film's content was drawn.But try to look at the film, as I do now, as 1) how those who first saw the film in 1931 reacted, and 2) what kind of a film making experience it provides those of any age and time. Then we can appreciate that this is a beautifully crafted film! So many pluses: It was the first sound presentation (there had been three silent versions) of the macabre theme, that is, giving life to the dead and creating a new body from others' body parts-- so amazingly presented in the bleakly atmospheric, and suggestive opening sequences with Dwight Frye and Colin Clive. The astonishing way the Monster is first shown-- Frankenstein lowers the lights, the door opens, and the Monster BACKS into the room (heightening the suspense) and then he slowly turns around, and then we see him in three increasingly closer shots! Wow! You'll never see this subtlety in any other Frankenstein film! The prologue by Edward Van Sloan, and the unseen face of the Monster when he comes to life really sets you up for the screams that must have ensued when the cavernous face of Karloff was first shown! From then on, it must have been pure blasphemous shock for audiences of the time! But what about us? This movie passed my ""Test of Time"" test -- I watched it with my 8 and 10 year old grandchildren! They were hypnotized throughout the whole movie (not getting bored to play with their toys) with the 10 year old having a nightmare and waking up at 4:30 a.m. this morning (""I can't sleep!""). (Of course, I've raised them on 'Betty Boop,' and 'Popeye' so they were no strangers to black and white films.)To continue with the pluses: first, Boris Karloff's impressive, compassionate and intelligent performance. The close up of his hands in which he skillfully expressed emotion-- yearning for friendship and connections with others. Of course, it was not unusual in the days of silent films for pathos, feeling and emotion to be expressed with the body; one thinks of, for example, of how Conrad Veidt's hands get scarier and scarier in 'Orlac's Hands' (1925), or of the amazing Lillian Gish, and the use of her eyes to express fear in 'Broken Blossoms' (1919). We still have this great use of silent technique in 1931. Second, the photography. The black outs that allow a brief 'whew' between contrasting macabre scenes with normal movie scenes; the innovative camera angles to show off the off-kilter 'Caligari' sets; the cutaways during lateral shots; the great high and low angle shots in all of the watchtower scenes. Third, the use of James Whale's 'stable' of British actors previously used by him, who did so well in the film. Colin Clive, the precursor of Peter Cushing as the quintessential British scientist, has been immortalized for his manic, hysterical yet justified (as an experimental scientist) cry of ""It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive!"" (Shades of Rotwang in 'Metropolis'!), even though he is fine throughout the film. Mae Clark and Frederick Kerr as the cantankerous Baron (and even John Boles) perform their roles well. All with good direction by Whale, that places this way above the (mostly) stagy, stilted acting of 'Dracula' (also 1931).Therefore, the more we watch this film, the more we see how well crafted it is on its own terms.",Frankenstein
163,freaky_dave,Probably the best of the original movie monsters,10,21 October 2006,"Frankenstein, and this does not include the sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is probably the best made movie of the three big ones which include Dracula and The Wolf Man.All three of these movies are classics in their own right, but the one I seemed to like the most would have to be Frankenstein. Boris Karloff brings something to the role of the creature that makes one see that he was just a misunderstood victim in a cold world. Colin Clive was also very good as Henry Frankenstein, the man who created the monster, as were all the others. Not one of the characters is really made out to be evil, and I kind of liked seeing that in a movie.I also enjoyed the Gothic settings and scenery. This movie carried the right mood and lighting to create a wonderful atmosphere which is just the way it should be. When I think of Frankenstein, or even the other two films, I can easily pick up on why the scenery was so important to all three films. It is the type of scenery that should be a part of any movie which involves the three biggest monsters of all time.Frankenstein was probably the most thrilling of the three movies as well. When I compare the three I would say that Dracula faded near the end and The Wolf Man was just a little too much talk, but Frankenstein seemed to find the right amount of storytelling and character development to make it the most beloved of all the universal monsters. I haven't seen Bride of Frankenstein yet, but I've been told it's even better than Frankenstein. I guess I'll have to watch it and see.",Frankenstein
164,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Nice but the characters lack depth,6,5 April 2015,"The first time I have watched the original Frankenstein movie was a long time ago and on a revisit I only remembered a few things. The one I did remember was the one where the monster interacted with the little girl ending in tragedy. On a revisit it is still the most gripping scene of the movie. The movie is short and moves fast, starts immediately with Frankenstein junior collecting body parts to create his ""monster"" together with the usual humpback helper. You really want to have sympathy for the monster but the movie does not give me enough time for that. Also the other characters really do not get much depth including Henry Frankenstein. Anyway for a first not a bad effort.",Frankenstein
165,LanceBrave,He is Not Born a Monster,10,23 November 2013,"The earliest scenes of ""Frankenstein"" are haunted by the spectres of death. The opening burial, taken place in a barren, stark graveyard, is watched over by a gruesome grim reaper statue. Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein literally throws dirt in Death's face in this scene. Another early moment featuring Edward Von Sloan's Dr. Waldman is framed by shelves full of skulls. Fritz' robbery of the brain, his shadow cast huge on the wall, is foiled by a hanging library skeleton. The morbidity of the subject matter extends to the very structure of the film.I can't believe I never noticed the deeply expressionistic sets in this movie before. The pattern on the floor of Frankenstein's laboratory are criss-crossed at conflicting angle, putting the viewer off. The beams and walls in the tower are at askew angles, subtly evoking an otherworldly atmosphere. The Monster's prison are the sets most obviously indebted to ""Caligari"" and its ilk. The sole window appears in the center of a slouching triangle while the door is tightly squeezed between two encroaching walls. Even the hallways of the ancestral Frankenstein home are slightly in the same style. The film's extensive use of shadows and lightening seals it. ""Frankenstein"" is the extreme surreal stylings of 1920s German cinema streamlined for an American audience.Colin Clive's performance as the Doctor is sort of underrated. His more manic moments are the most famous but his quieter scenes work well too. In Mary Shelley's novel, the desire to recreate life is born out of a desire to conquer the death in his own life. In a monologue, Clive's Doctor reveals that his experiments steam from what he sees as a natural progression of man's curiosity and science. Even his softer scenes with Elizabeth have a warmest to them. Dwight Fry ultimately isn't given too much to do, due to Fritz' monosyllabic nature, but his body language still sells the character. In the final version of the film, the character of Victor doesn't serve much of a purpose. Originally there to be beside Elizabeth after Henry's demise, the revised, happier ending ultimately leaves the love triangle unresolved. It's a bit of a shame since John Boles makes the usually aggravating third wheel of the obligatory love triangle actually a pretty nice guy.The nature of Karloff's monster has been discussed endlessly. Listening to Ruby Belhmer's informative, if overly studious commentary, it's not surprising to learn that the ""criminal brain"" aspect of the script was a late addition. It seems to me that James Whale's intention was that the Creature was a pure innocent, totally child-like in nature. His reaction to Maria the flower girl's drowning is one of abject horror. He is not born a monster, but rather transformed into one by the cruelty and rejection of the world. His only truly malicious move is the murder of Dr. Waldman. Even the attempted abduction of Elizabeth could be explained away by a naive curiosity. In the original script, the doctor's laboratory was also the climatic windmill. In light of this, the Monster dragging Henry's limp body back there becomes a frightened, confused creature returning to the only home he's ever known with the only person to show him anything but cruelty in hand. The film is even more a tragedy then ever before.James Whale seems fond of side-way sliding dolly shots. He uses them numerous times, passing through the set's walls as if they were a stage play. Undoubtedly, the most memorable of these types of shot is Maria's father carrying her body through the village. Behind him, the celebrating faces of the villagers transform into frozen faces of terror, their songs dissolving into horrified screams. Though the sequel would make it obvious, ""Frankenstein"" does contain some of Whale's trademark camp humor. The elder Baron Frankenstein, fed up and disgusted with his son's antics, is the film's primarily comic relief and far more subtle then the era's usual style. The film certainly never suffers from the pacing problems ""Dracula"" has.Long time readers should know how much this film means to me. I could ramble on for pages. Instead, I'll cut it off here. ""Frankenstein"" is a great, great movie. If you haven't seen it, you've got no excuse.",Frankenstein
166,NerdBat,Deserving of its title,7,25 June 2018,"Of course, one of the best monster movies of all time, and one of which we all know, it's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. What's funny is most people get confused, and think the monster is called Frankenstein. In reality, Frankenstein is the name of the scientist who created it. Being that this film is from 1931, starring the amazing Boris Karloff, it really is far ahead of its time. Beautiful effects, and a plot line that doesn't drag along and bore you like a lot of older monster films. In the age it was made, the film must have been absolutely terrifying. A humongous mash up of body parts made into a body that has the mind of a criminal. Sounds like some kind of horrific drug trip. My overall opinion of the movie though? It's wonderful.

167,schroeder-gustavo,A Must Watch for Any Horror Enthusiast,9,8 July 2015,"One of the most influential not only horror, but movies in general of all time, Frankenstein is a classic. The influence this movie has in pop culture is incredible, everyone knows at least to some extent the story of Frankenstein's Monster. But does it deserve its status as a classic? Does the movie hold up to today's standards?For the most part, yes, I do believe Frankenstein is an excellent movie for several reasons. First, the cinematography is amazing, even by today's standards. Thanks to it, the movie has a dark, Gothic atmosphere that is constant during the film. Second, the acting. Boris Karloff in an iconic performance as the Monster and Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein is great, as well. This movie had so many original ideas, like the mad scientist, the angry mob.I do think the movie is flawed in a way that they never explain a few things. Like why is Frankenstein so strong, yet walks like he feels weak? The movie has aged very well, except in maybe a few scenes. The biggest flaw of the movie is the ending. The movie simply ends so abruptly, you get no sense of closure. The movie is an hour and ten minutes long, so maybe it should have been a bit longer just to get the ending right.But I loved so many things about this movie and the thing I love the most is the fact that it makes you question yourself several times during the film and after it ended. Is the Monster good or evil? Is it not the Creator who is evil, instead of the Creature? Is it not cruel to chain the monster in a dungeon? How would you react if they did that to you? What are the consequences to playing God? I love it when a movie makes you think and Frankenstein is certainly a film that does that. I also found it very impressive that they use no music at all during the movie, except in the opening titles and credits, which is a tough feat to pull off, but they did it.Frankenstein is an excellent film. It is an iconic classic about the nature of life itself, it makes you think and, if you think hard enough, it is a film with a powerful message.",Frankenstein
168,Condemned-Soul,'Frankenstein' puts forward the question: Who is the real monster?,8,22 August 2018,"Old but not dated, 'Frankenstein' set the standard for horror films, influencing them for decades to come with a very simple story of man and monster. Flawlessly cast and strongly written, its a convincing achievement in palpable dread and unease. 
Boris Karloff's iconic portrayal of the misunderstood monster, who's ugly, beastly exterior belies a childlike mind and an existence led by fear, is matched by Colin Clive (Henry Frankenstein), the scientist who stitched his masterpiece together from exhumed body parts, carrying his performance with maniacal enthusiasm in his pursuit of scientific breakthroughs and chilling discoveries. 
Karloff's lumbering steps and haunting look provide many sequences of mild terror, particularly the memorable scene with a little girl by the lake which is a legendary example of unsettling horror where the imagery will forever be remembered. Frankenstein pursues his creation along with the villagers right up to its inevitably sad conclusion, an ending that sees you conflicted about what is right and wrong regarding character motivations and actions based on things they don't fully understand or reason mutually.
A definitive classic of the horror genre, 'Frankenstein' is brief film that never outstays its welcome, and leaves the audience with the most important question of who was the true monster.",Frankenstein
169,twanurit,Look No Further,10,14 December 2001,"The Mary Shelley novel has been re-made for movies and television scores of times. This is the definitive version, holding up beautifully after more than 70 years. Boris Karloff, under heavy makeup, is still able to convey emotion through his face and hands, one of the all-time best performances, in horror or otherwise. His childlike creature only kills when he feels threatened: by a tormenting dwarf (Dwight Frye), a doctor (Edward Van Sloan) who's about to dissect him, accidentally a girl (Marilyn Harris) whom he thinks can float, and almost Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who lunges at him with a torch. The direction (James Whale), script, cast, atmosphere, lighting, photography, sets, are exemplary. The lack of a musical score only adds to the eeriness. The electrical equipment was re-used in the sequels. The original script had Dr. Frankenstein dying at the end, but was changed, which would account for the distant shot of him and his fiancée in the last scene (Clive and Mae Clarke were unavailable). That would also explain the John Boles character, a would-be replacement for Clive, to marry Clarke. Karloff appeared in 2 sequels, the first ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) many cite as superior to this one. I disagree, for the creature talks, creating a much lighter (and campier) tone. The third was ""The Son of Frankenstein"" (1939), and the creature has a supporting role, with Karloff the actor heavier and in a weird wool cloth get-up. But ""Son's"" musical score was exceptional (and used again). Universal studios, especially during the ""Golden Age"", from 1923 through 1960, will always be known as the studio of monsters, since most were very well-done.",Frankenstein
170,TheMovieDoctorful,"An Iconic, Timeless Horror Tragedy",10,31 October 2020,"I cannot overstate how enormously influential James Whale's Frankenstein has been on me as a director and writer. It's the film that put American Horror on the map, but to simplify its massive achievement so plainly would be a gross disservice. What Whale did was create a massive, captivating fairy tale world of men and monsters, as sweepingly romantic as it is unsettlingly eerie and disturbing. Even minor side characters like Fritz, Victor Clerval and Dr. Waldman carry so much intrigue and emotional gravitas they could easily hold up films of their own. Given that, it goes without saying that the main players are truly three dimensional, rich and fully realized. Whale does more to make his characters feel like real, multi-faceted people in 1 hour and 10 minutes than most directors today can manage in 2.Henry Frankenstein is such a fascinating protagonist, anchored by a all-time great performance from Colin Clive. Right from the beginning, the way Clive's Frankenstein salivates at a freshly buried corpse, holding an expression that can only be described as hungry eyes, it's clear this character is deeply mentally unstable. That being said, the more we see of Henry in his interactions with loved ones, the more relatable and sympathetic he becomes. Clive carries such a sincere anxiety in his vocal delivery whenever interacting with his fiance Elizabeth or old mentor Dr. Waldman that suggests that he knows his ambition has become a toxic compulsion, he really does try to create a sort of alter-ego locked away in his old castle, his delicate double life almost evokes that of an addict and it's extremely compelling.Boris Karloff is one of my favorite actors of all-time and right from his first appearance in the film, he immediately commands pity and compassion. That shot of him reaching up to the light of the moon outside is tragic and moving on such a subconscious level, especially given the way Karloff portrays The Monster as an innocent toddler trapped in the body of a superhuman. In a way, his warmth and kindness almost makes him more frightening. When he throws Maria into the pond, the look in his eyes conveys not a hint of malice or ill intent, but wonder and love. He doesn't kill and destroy intentionally, he's an abomination who doesn't even know what he is, let alone the freakish strength he's been given. Who knows what deadly mayhem he could stumble his way into?With an endearing, self destructive monster and a unsettlingly relatable hero, the film does a great job creating a rivalry between 2 lovable, but deeply flawed, leads and really allows its audience to decide whose plight deserves out investment more; either we want to see Henry Frankenstein overcome his demons of obsession or Frankenstein's Monster find understanding and peace in a violent world. Of course, this isn't possible as long as they both live. One of them must die, tragedy must have its day.Mae Clarke's Elizabeth Lavenza is deeply underrated. I confess, I do prefer Valerie Hobson's more consistently unhinged and disturbed take, but Lavenza's headstrong, confident woman of science trying to ignore the nightmare her husband has unleashed is an excellent take, nonetheless. I like to imagine that Shelly herself would be proud of Whale's dignified and strong characterization of Elizabeth, especially decades before these kind of scientifically gifted female characters would be commonplace on screen.Every shot in this film is absolutely beautiful, to the level they could be displayed in an art museum. Whale's direction is beautiful, epic and grand, but also lonely and isolating. Even in happy or romantic scenes, his wideshots always give the feeling that the film's moments of peace and tranquility are just that; moments. The fact that Whale was able to accomplish such gorgeously desolate images in a film almost entirely on backlot with extremely limited tech and constant interference is so unbelievably inspiring.A beautiful masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made. A must watch for any lover of cinema, genre fan or not.",Frankenstein

172,simeon_flake,"Crazy, am I....",7,28 January 2005,"After buying the 'Legacy' DVDs for the classic Universal Big Three (Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein monster) I've had a good time going back & revisiting all the old favorites of my childhood. I started with the monster & have to admit I found this first interpretation of Whale's monster story to be a bit lacking. Not bad, but not as great as it's hyped to be, unlike its sequel.The opening setting for the film is certainly impressive, with the tearful mourners and the 'mad' doctor and henchman lurking in the background, waiting to take the freshly buried corpse (He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come). Colin Clive sets the tone for the movie as he tosses a big shovel full of dirt in the face of the statue of Death that's positioned behind him. Clive is really the star in this one & it's his performance that kept me into this one for the most part, particularly the unforgettable sequence as he gives life to the monster in front of the stunned eyes of his soon to be wife Elizabeth, Victor, and his old mentor Dr. Waldman.Any review of FRANKENSTEIN wouldn't be complete without a mention of ""Karloff"". He gives a good deal of humanity to the monster & I certainly empathized with his plight of being thrust into an alien world, where everyone, including his maker, is all too ready to shun him because of how different he is from the ""normal"" folks. But Karloff's screen time feels awfully small compared to how much we get of him in the ""Bride"". There's a feeling that there could've been a lot more for Whale to explore with the monster in the movie, but couldn't due to the limited runtime.To conclude, I'll say 'Frankenstein' is just a ""good"" movie that certainly is a sufficient starting point for the greatness that would come 4 years later.7/10",Frankenstein
173,Cyke,Movie Odyssey Review #058: Frankenstein,9,16 January 2007,"058: Frankenstein (1931) - released 11/21/1931; viewed 5/23/06.DOUG: We take in another cornerstone release from Universal, James Whale's Frankenstein. Like Dracula, this movie is very stripped down. Right at the beginning, Dr. Frankenstein is in the thick of working on his experiment, along with his hunchback servant Fritz (Dwight Frye, who doesn't have to waste any time being a nimrod straight man this time around). Earlier, I listed the Frankenstein monster as the fifth major villain to hit the screen in this year (after Caesar Enrico Bandeli, Tom Powers, Dracula, and Hans Beckert). It occurred to me while watching that perhaps the villain isn't the monster, but is actually the doctor, played by Colin Clive, who carries the first half of the movie with his performance. I think I'm going to let it be Boris Karloff's monster, who carries the movie through to its home stretch; I look forward to the sequels later on. It is, of course, impossible to watch this film today without thinking about Young Frankenstein (and I'm sure the same is true of a number of the sequels). Some of the movie is a bit dated, though the scene where the monster tosses little Maria into the pond is still chilling. Talk about dated, there's a scene late in the film that I'm sure was very scary in 1931, but I found extremely funny: the Monster sneaks into Elizabeth's room, and there's about 20 seconds where she's unaware of his presence as a modern audience screams ""LOOK BEHIND YOU! HE'S RIGHT THERE!"" the way we do in all silly horror films these days. Then when she notices him, he goes in for the kill; the camera cuts to a close-up, and the Monster's lip curls up as he growls like Bob Hope. That was weird.KEVIN: Here we have the fifth and final villain of 1931, but it's up for debate whether it is Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) or his Monster (Boris Karloff). Most of the horror in this movie has become terribly cheesy, but Karloff's performance is still scary as hell. When he first lumbers in, he doesn't seem fully human or truly alive. His face has become the standard for Frankenstein's monster, yet even now it still invokes such uneasiness. Colin Clive's titular doctor is also surprisingly creepy, with his escalating madness bringing out a performance almost as unforgettable as the Monster. This film holds up much better than Dracula. There's much more on screen violence, and the characters aren't as idiotic. One of the unique qualities about this version of the story is the way it starts in the middle. In the very first scene we find Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye, back again!) digging up another corpse for their experiments. The advantage of this kind of storytelling is that it adds mystery to the doctor's actions right as the film begins. If you don't know the story, you're not sure what he's up to, but you know it's not good. It also allows us to get right into the action. The disadvantage of doing this is that we don't get a clear picture of who Frankenstein was before he became obsessed with playing god and cheating death.Last film: The Champ (1931). Next film: Mata Hari (1931).",Frankenstein
174,jed-estes,One Of The Best Horror Films Ever!,10,1 September 2006,"I love this movie and am sure at it's time it was the ultimate scare fest. Of all the Universal horror films of that era, excluding the 1935 sequel, this is the best. It still holds up well today and I love that Boris Karloff was really the first franchise monster actor. He is the precursor to Robert Englund, Kane Hodder, Angus Scrimm, Tony Todd, and Doug Bradly, among others. Karloff's films though had more prestige in them then any other horror film. This is not to say that all other horror films are bad because the are not good looking. It just means that this film was made differently than the way horror is made today. Today the vast majority of the films are backyard productions done quick fast and cheap, which there is nothing wrong with and I love those movies too, But this film was one of the first and it is by even todays standards probably one of the most expensive studio Horror productions out there and it makes this film different. I love too that this film went for it with killing the little girl by the lake. I can't imagine how in 1931 they managed to get this one past. In today's world of stupid PG-13 Asian horror films it almost impossible to show the kids being killed. This movie is classic and should be watched by everyone. Stay tuned for the Bride though.",Frankenstein
175,Don-102,"Dated-yes, scary-sure, must see-absolutely !",9,20 March 1999,"James Whale's original FRANKENSTEIN is a short but memorable horror classic that has influenced so many other fright flicks, it should be considered the Godfather of Horror Movies. This was the first of Universal Studios' moody screen adaptations of literary Gothic horror (the other being Dracula). Put all thoughts regarding Mary Shelly's novel aside and see this original work of art, with Boris Karloff bringing the ultimate monster to life.The sets are a pure spin off of German Expressionism. The good Doctor Frankenstein's castle is twisted and distorted and seems to be not of this world. He is played by Colin Clive in a delightfully freakish performance. And, of course, the well-proportioned Fritz is there to help. Notice the signposts of evil in the opening grave robbing scenes. It is a prop-master's dream and the black and white photography displays a theatrical sense of spookiness. ""It's Alive!"" will live forever as one of the cinema's most familiar lines and the picture begins to sparkle as Karloff is brought to life. The influence of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is evident during the dazzling scene of the Monster's birth.Boris Karloff is and always will be the prototypical Monster. The closeups of his face are truly frightening after all these years. He is walking death, however, Karloff gives him a hint of sadness, of a creature who was not meant to be. The flower-toss scene with the little girl was so controversial at the time of the film's release, it was cut from many versions. The new, restored print available on video has it.I know FRANKENSTEIN has been spoofed many times and is wide-open to criticism regarding its dated look. Mel Brooks went so far as to use the actual props from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory in his hilarious send-up, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Be sure to keep an open mind and watch it in the dark. Boris Karloff and James Whale have created a monstrously fun film.",Frankenstein

Just watch the scene where Boris Karloff(the Monster)enters into the room backwards,then seeing a close-up of his face! Jack Pierce(make-up) did a great job. He also created the make-up for ""The Wolfman"" among other Universal Studios monster sequels. The story is a Gothic tale of how a mad scientist creates a monster. His creation understands only violence, the victim of having an abnormal brain inserted into a body comprised of body parts from several corpses. Colin Clive is outstanding in his role of Dr. Frankenstein. He is a genius,misunderstood and eccentric. Edward Van Sloan is equally fine as Dr. Waldman. Mae Clarke plays Elizabeth, Dr. Frankenstein's understanding bride to be. James Whale's direction is right on the money. A true horror classic.",Frankenstein
177,thespeos,"Fine for 1931, But Some Holes",7,5 June 2021,"Hmm ... I suppose that for 1931 this was well done, but I'm just not feeling the joy.There are some solid performances, and the settings were very believable ... but overall it had some holes and inconsistencies that suggest some sloppy directing.STORY: Most of you know the story well, and frankly the story still stands as unique - how to create human mechanics and consciousness from dead human parts. Mary Shelley's novel was (probably) presented as accurately as she intended (but I've never read the book).ACTING: Overall, the acting was fine, some stiffs but OK for the early years of ""talkies."" The lead does a good job of expressing the insane genius of the ""good doctor,"" and his fiance was very natural and expressive. Some of the others were on the comatose side of life.TEMPO: It moved well for its story and genre.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The sights and sounds were quite good: realistic and artful, especially for 1931.DIRECTING: Overall OK, but there were some real strange choices that made little sense. The character of ""Fritz"" (Igor) was so inconsistent. If he was such a moron, why would a brilliant man have him as an assistant? Why is he using a cane when he obviously doesn't need it. Why is he tormenting the monster, and why does ""Herr Doctor"" allow it by walking away? The lead character was either suffering from clinical confusion, or he just couldn't make up his mind about many things. Terribly inconsistent, and strongly doubt it was Shelley's intent to have wan ton behavior.Summary: This is great for a peek into where ""horror"" films were birthed from, but as a pure film, it's just OK.If you enjoy the whole ""Frankenstein"" story then I urge you to watch ""Young Frankenstein"" with Gene Wilder, directed by Mel Brooks. That ... is one funny movie!",Frankenstein
178,Norm-30,An All-Time Classic!,10,30 September 1999,"Is there ANYONE who hasn't seen this horror classic?  Many people don't know that originally BELA LUGOSI was chosen to play the Monster!  He turned it down ""because it didn't have a speaking part"" and his face would've been unrecognisable. He later said that ""it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life!"".  Even tho I think that ""Bride of"" is a much better film, this is a CLASSIC in the true sense of the word.

179,Sunsphxsuns,"Henry Frankenstein: ""IT'S ALIVE!""",10,1 September 2021,"When I was 12 years old and growing up in Southern California, one of the highlights of my ""Kid TV Friday Nights"" was when, after dinner, my mother would prepare an immense bowl of hot buttered popcorn. Once it was ready, my father would dramatically walk around the room, slowly dimming the lights one by one. Then, the three of us would sink into our well-used couch to watch a classic black and white horror movie on our equally black and white television. This was a time where home Video and DVD players, Cable and Satellite dishes, had yet to be invented. Moreover, TV programming abruptly ended quite patriotically at midnight with the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" playing, and would not return until 5 AM with the obligatory ""farm report.""These spooky Friday night films were hosted by either the darkly amusing ""Sinister Seymour,"" or the provocative and sexy ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" (who some claim she shamelessly stole her act from her predecessor, ""Vampira""). Admittedly, I was still too young to fully appreciate Miss Elvira, the alluring, outlandishly silly, sly, curvaceous horror hostess, draped in her clinging black gown and black lipstick. Nevertheless, I vaguely recognized that she was clearly a lot of fun to watch even though most of her naughty double entendres safely flew over my naive, adolescent head.In those intoxicating days of youth and exploration, and with the encouragement of my parents, I became ""cinematically aware."" I recognized that Dracula (1931) played by Bela Lugosi, and Frankenstein (1931) played by Boris Karloff, weren't your typical, pedestrian horror films. Both Lugosi and Karloff were relatively ""unknown actors"" at this point in their storied careers, and it's likely neither actor anticipated the incredible gravity of being type cast forever as a result of the rapidly exploding genre of ""B"" horror films. Lugosi in particular was unsuccessful at shedding his Hollywood stereotyped images as a ""blood lusting vampire,"" a ""ruthless gangster,"" or a "" mad doctor."" The more romantic ""A"" films never came his way, nor did they for Karloff.Today, as a more experienced film fan, Lugosi's 1931 Dracula, was, and is still, my favorite ""brooding vampire"" horror film. And even though both ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" are now (as of 2021) 90 years old since they were first released to movie audiences, Frankenstein does not disappoint, making it my second favorite horror film of all time.Like the original ""Dracula,""""Frankenstein"" has a rich history which began when the indefatigable author, Mary Shelley, bravely published her novel in 1818. By 1910 her story was adapted into a silent film. In 1931, the brilliant director, James Whale, transformed Shelly's moody novel into a film with sound. It was an immediate hit.To fully appreciate ""Frankenstein"" you must first remember that in 1931, CGI and advanced technical effects had not been born yet. Dr. Victor Frankenstein's laboratory was simply a melange of lights and electrical currents ominously blinking and buzzing on the movie set, while behind the scenes, a frantic crew struggled to provide artificial wind, rain, lightening and thunder, all in a Herculean effort to transform a primitive movie set into a weather torn stone castle, a fortress, battling against nature even as the maniacal doctor goes insane from his obsession to create a living man from recently deceased bodies. And it is this spectacular imagery that continues to burn in our collective memories: The "" mad doctor,"" raving, celebrating his monster creation. ""It's alive!""he shouts. ""Alive!""One must watch Frankenstein (1931) in the same way you might view a priceless painting or other work of art, because, sadly, ""Frankenstein"" is the kind of carefully crafted film Hollywood used to effortlessly make year after year, although now it appears that particular formula may have been forever lost to time.",Frankenstein

181,RomanJamesHoffman,Stuff of cinematic legend.,8,27 June 2012,"It is an honour bestowed on few movies that a part of it (whether it be an image, a snippet of dialogue, or a section of its musical score) is considered so iconic that it transcends its original context and moves into the wider arena of popular culture and yet 'Frankenstein', with Colin Clive's hysterical announcement that ""It's alive!"" and the rapid progressive close-ups of Boris Karloff as the monster, offers two! It is also likely that 'Frankenstein' hasn't offered a piece of its score into the pop-culture domain due to fact that it doesn't actually have one(!) otherwise all three categories would surely have been checked.However, within the iconic power of 'Frankenstein' lie the seeds of some points of criticism which the fledgling cinephile should be wary of. One such criticism is that the film comes from an era when cinema was a young medium and struggling to distinguish itself from theatre and its conventions. As such, many aspects of the direction, editing, and narrative pacing owe a lot to theatre (Whale had previously been a theatre director) and may seem quant and/or dated by modern audience standards. Also, the strong imagery and lasting impression of the film saw it descend first into unselfconscious parody with the series of sequels that followed, culminating in 1948s 'Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein', and later with the wholly self-conscious parody of Mel Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein' (1974).As for criticisms, the two points above are about as far as it goes, and neither can really be said to be a fault of the film itself. What remains is a film suffused with a Gothic ambiance of decay, derangement, and despair: from the opening grave-digging scene, to the inside of Frankenstein's laboratory and the animation of the monster, all the way to the marauding villagers who hunt him down. Karloff's performance as the monster is legendary, and what makes it so effective is his choice to portray the monster as a victim who is able to evoke sympathy and terror in equal measure, a mix which finds its most controversial expression in the girl-by-the-lake scene which was cut from the movie in its full form for many years. While the stand out performances are clearly Clive and Karloff, the rest of the cast support adeptly, serving as understated splashes of normality against which the madness is enacted. Completing this twisted milieu are the studio sets which clearly owe much to such German Expressionist classics like 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (1920), 'Nosferatu' (1922) and 'Metropolis' (1927) and summon the claustrophobia which reflects perfectly the distorted view of reality of the protagonists.Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' (1931), 'Frankenstein' was responsible for the Universal horror movie boom, and yet, apart from Whale's own 'Bride of Frankenstein', none of the other titles in the catalogue match the vision, power, and pathos of 'Frankenstein': a movie about technological advancement usurping God and creating life, so how fitting that 'Frankenstein' is arguably one of the first films to achieve cinematic immortality.",Frankenstein
182,stephenstephenbyrne,A solid start,7,7 November 2020,"Iconic for all the reasons it should be. It really is visually striking. I love the second half especially but there is occasionally a bit of that jankiness which you sometimes get with films from the 30's, particularly in the editing choices.",Frankenstein
183,boscofl,"""In the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!""",10,14 September 2021,"Of all the classic Universal horror films from the Laemmle Era Frankenstein is the best in terms of straight horror, pure and simple. It still packs a wallop today with a solid script, creative direction by James Whale, and the iconic performance by Boris Karloff as the Monster. Unlike Dracula time has not diminished this masterpiece and it stands on its own in modern times as quality entertainment.The plot of the film is likely familiar to everyone and therefore doesn't require rehashing here. Unlike his future ""horror"" films (The Old Dark House, The Invisible Man, and Bride of Frankenstein) James Whale largely avoids the black humor that permeates those works and goes for straight chills. He establishes all the iconography that would be present throughout the Universal series: fantastic electrical machines buzzing and shooting off sparks, the famous European backlot, an angry torch-bearing mob, and the legendary monster makeup by Jack Pierce. Whale employs fluid camerawork, abundant close ups, and interesting composition within his shots that gives Frankenstein an engaging look. He also eschews a musical score for ambient sounds which adds to the dramatic weight of the proceedings and coaxes natural performances from his cast. Overall, a superior directorial effort.Frankenstein has so many famous (and parodied) scenes that it is difficult to cite them all. Suffice to say the creation scene still packs a punch with flashing lights punctuated by the memorable Universal thunder claps and Colin Clive's hysterical performance. The initial appearance of the monster has lost some of its impact since the makeup has become so famous but one can only imagine the screams in the 1931 theaters when he first faces the camera. Possibly the most celebrated scene is the one between the Monster and Maria at the lake that illustrates what a gentle, misunderstood creature he truly is. This sequence was snipped by the censors in order to avoid showing the Monster tossing her into the water and for decades these shots remained lost. Paradoxically in endeavoring to sanitize the film the censors provided a more diabolical possibility: the scene ended with the Monster reaching towards Maria and the next time we see the poor girl her lifeless body is being carried down the street looking dirty, disheveled, and with one stocking pulled down; the implications here are far more sinister than an accidental drowning.While Frankenstein is a fantastic film it is not flawless with significant plot holes that elicit some interesting questions: How does Fritz get away with giving Henry an abnormal brain? There's a huge label that clearly says ""ABNORMAL""; does he switch containers? Why does Fritz torment the Monster? Why does Henry employ such a complete bungler as Fritz in the first place? Who found the dead Dr Waldman? How does Ludwig know Maria was murdered and, skipping that, how does he know who did it? How does the Monster know where Henry lives? Why does he attack Elizabeth? There's more to ponder but it's best not to heavily scrutinize a film that deals with reanimating a body assembled from multiple cadavers.Special mention must go to Jack Pierce for his iconic monster concept. His makeup is famous throughout the world and the singular most famous creature creation of all time. Of course, it wouldn't matter without the virtuoso performance by Boris Karloff in bringing the design to life. Despite being encased in a suffocating costume the pathos of the Monster is remarkably conveyed by Karloff particularly through his eyes. He is not an evil creature and never commits an unprovoked act of aggression; he's either defending himself, lashing out at those who mean to harm him, or misunderstanding a situation. The Monster became a huge hit with children (like myself when I first encountered him) who understood his nature and basic innocence. Karloff never gets enough credit for this magnificent performance; it is truly one of the most remarkable character turns ever committed to celluloid.The rest of the cast is splendid as well. Colin Clive gives a tense, tormented, and occasionally overwrought rendition of the tortured genius Henry Frankenstein. His ""It's alive!"" moment is legendary and perhaps the most famous bit in all classic horror. Mae Clarke makes the most of her opportunities while giving a natural, believable interpretation. John Boles is bland and forgettable (to be fair the character isn't much) while Fredrick Kerr is a hoot as old Baron Frankenstein; all of James Whale's trademark humor is channeled through this cantankerous character. Two Dracula alums and genre icons Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan grace the film as Fritz and Dr. Waldman, respectively. Frye cements his legacy as Universal's top cinematic weirdo (thus torpedoing his own career) and channels some Renfield as Henry's blundering assistant while Van Sloan is superb as Henry's former teacher who isn't so lucky in dispatching the Monster as he was staking Count Dracula. Two familiar faces for Universal Horror fans, Michael Mark and Lionel Belmore, make their initial genre appearance as well.To sum it all up James Whale's Frankenstein is a cinematic masterpiece that expounded on the success of the earlier Dracula and firmly established Universal as the undisputed master of macabre movies. It propelled Whale into his finest period of creativity and success while launching Boris Karloff as the Number One horror star of all time. Many more classics would emerge through the efforts of these two not to mention an immortal series of Frankenstein films that are still loved and cherished by cinephiles like myself.",Frankenstein

186,leftistcritic,"A ""marauding"" monster and the ""madness"" of science",10,8 April 2019,"Last night, the lightning of the thunderstorm struck outside, ""madness"" overtook me as my creation came alive on the table, its hand twitching, and I declared, in front of my fiancé-to-be, father, and fellow scientist, that ""I know what it feels like to BE God!,"" which would be considered blasphemy by some. I am describing the pivotal scene in this film, which boards in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York objected to, even censoring the scene when the monster kills a girl of the village of the Bavarian Alps, where the film is set, Maria (played by Marilyn Harris), by accidentally drowning her, a scene which was only rediscovered in the 1980s in a collection of the British National Film Archive and then re-incorporated into the film itself. This was a film that pulled in enough popularity, although it only earned $12 million at the box office, that Hollyweird decided to make a string of sequels like the Bride of Frankenstein (1935), Son of Frankenstein (1939), The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), and Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943).While there are 544 reviews of this film on IMDB currently, I will chart my own path with this review. As the film began I felt like I was watching the first Treehouse of Horror episode of The Simpsons where Marge appears in front of a curtain to warn the audience of the horrors that will unfold. As the film went on, the storyline was abundantly clear. Henry Frankenstein (played by Colin Clive) is a ""mad scientist"" whom is working with a hunchback named Fritz (played by Dwight Frye) feels that he can bring ""life"" to something that was once dead, creating a creature by harnessing the lightning of a storm. Henry's fiancé-to-be, Elizabeth Lavenza (played by Mae Clark), her friend Victor Moritz (played by John Boles), and Dr. Waldman (played by Edward Van Sloan), visit him in his castle atop the hill, watch as the creature is brought to life, a creation which has one problem: it has an abnormal brain. Soon, as the creature/monster awakes, it is tortured in a sense by Henry and Fritz, who, along with Victor and Dr. Waldman, try to control it. This is a failure, as after Henry leaves with his fiancé-to-be, proving that Henry's father, Baron Frankenstein (played by Frederick Kerr) is wrong to think that Henry has found another woman, Dr. Waldman is overpowered by the monster (played by Boris Karloff), which kills him and proceeds to leave what is, in effect, its prison, to go out to the town below. It is there that the monster accidentally kills Maria, whom is alone after her father, Ludwig (played by Michael Mark), leaves to go to town. Soon after Ludwig comes into town during the celebrations for the wedding of Henry and Elizabeth, with his drowned daughter in his arms, the men of the town are searching for the monster (with the women strangely left behind, showing a clear gender divide here). Eventually they track the monster down and it brings an unconscious Henry, whom it had attacked earlier, to the windmill, which is soon burned to the ground, with the monster trapped outside but not before Henry is thrown off the windmill by the monster, whom is only injured by the fall, with the wedding soon celebrated by Baron Frankenstein in the film's last moments.There's a lot more to take in from this film. For one, unlike films like Contact where science is seen as engaging in wasteful endeavors which only benefit, directly or indirectly, capitalists, this film highlights the danger of science and the danger of creation. Maybe it is a lesson that those whom created the atomic bomb should have had in mind before creating such an abomination. Perhaps this is saying we shouldn't accept everything for science, but also allow for discovery to occur, with Henry only going to the depths of his creation because the university he was part of rejected his ideas as ""too radical,"" putting him literally on the margins. Secondly, this film also seems to be about the power of creation, including of life and death itself, and has been influential enough to be effectively spoofed in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein (1974) and partially so in the animated Frankenthumb. I also think that the search scene in The Truman Show (1998) is a homage to the search scene in this film. Perhaps even the scene where the townspeople confront The Simpsons with torches is also an homage to this film as well. It should also be no surprise that in various Treehouse of Horror episodes of the Simpsons (specifically III, XIV, XVIII, XX, and XXI) the film is referenced, for the 2015 film Ex Machina to retell the Frankenstein story with a feminine android in the 21st century, or for famed science fiction author, Isaac Asimov to coin the term ""Frankenstein complex"" to describe the fear of robots. In the end, this film has a very powerful effect on the viewer and is not as much of a horror or thriller film but rather a thoughtful and effective drama.With that, it seems only right to rate this film as a 10 out of 10, which I tend to not give many films these days anymore.",Frankenstein
187,Colbridge,May not please literary purists but for sheer cinema this is one of the most iconic and influential films of all time,9,14 November 2021,"James Whale's version of Mary Shelley's novel may not please literary purists but for sheer cinema this is one of the most iconic and influential films of all time thanks to the moody black & white atmospheric photography based on German expressionism, the stunning sets (later reused by Mel Brooks in Young Frankenstein 1974) and excellent work done by leads Colin Clive as the scientist and Boris Karloff as the Monster.Karloff reprised his role several times and the make-up effects used are truly iconic. Created by Greek make-up designer Jack P. Pierce he went on to do makeup effects for other Universal classic horror movies such as Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy and Phantom of the Opera to name but a few and is one of the unsung heroes from that period that created imagery that has been a major influence on filmmakers ever since.British director James Whale was a true craftsman and every scene in Frankenstein has meticulous detail to behold and is skillfully executed. Having revisited this classic horror film recently it still holds up extremely well despite it being a 90 year old movie. Colin Clive's cries of 'It's Alive! It's Alive!' sends shivers down the spine and Boris Karloff's tender, sympathetic, impulsive, misunderstood and angry performance as the Monster has never been bettered.From the opening grave robbing scenes, the electrifying bringing the monster to life scene, the 'I know what's it's like to be God' speech, the first glimpse of Karloff's Monster to the burning windmill at the end the imagery and central performances burn into the psyche and make this an unforgettable experience.Frankenstein is an essential moment in the evolution of cinema that shaped the way filmmakers depicted horror and science fiction for years to come and James Whale was a true pioneer.",Frankenstein

Over 70 years later, it is difficult to discuss without emotions and tears overwhelming one.Nothing else in ""Frankenstein"" matters, finally, but Karloff.Not the hand-sewn cyclorama ""sky"" in the opening sequence; not the superlative but dated supporting performances; not the magnificent (and dated) sets. Not James Whale's piercing direction.Nothing matters, but Karloff.I cannot help but cry, now, recalling his amazing achievement.Yes, I've seen the stills of Karloff smoking and joking between takes, in full makeup. Yes, I know the anecdotes about his being banned from Universal's commissary during lunch because of Jack Pierce's horrific makeup.Yes, I'm familiar with ""Bill"" Pratt, born in England in 1887: a stunningly handsome man with a lisp who wanted to be an actor: orphaned early: moved to Canada: jolted the world at 43 in ""Frankenstein"" after a couple of decades in Hollywood.But here's what matters.The performance. The hands. The body. The eyes. The incoherent sounds. The heart.Certainly, ""Frankenstein"" the film is not the astonishing work of fiction as originally written, in which the ""monster"" is fully articulate.Churned out of Universal's ""fright factory"" after ""Dracula,"" the film exists today as an artifact of its era.Except for Karloff's incredible portrayal.He far surpasses Lugosi and every other ""horror"" actor in presenting the heart of a man-made ""monster."" Wordlessly, Karloff conveys the heart-rending soul of the novel's ""Prometheus."" His anguished cries in the fiery climax are almost unbearable. A sub-human born of a ""human"" scientist, hounded and tormented throughout his brief existence, his only moment of child-like joy resulting in the innocent drowning of a little girl, confused, terrified, rageful -- Karloff gave us everything.Frankly, Karloff surpassed Cheney, in this one role. Certainly not in Cheney's cumulative career: no one could approach Cheney's scope.As years go by, and upon repeated viewings, Karloff's heartbreaking rendition of the ""monster"" must rank among the finest performances in history.Still, today.Amazing.Holy.Thank you, Mr. Pratt.",Frankenstein
189,danjakubik,The definitive horror classic,10,9 October 2010,"Frankenstein / 1931 / Directed by: James Whale / Written by: Garret Fort and Francis Edwards Faragoh / Adapted by: John Balderston (from the play by Peggy Webling).James Whale's adaptation of the classic Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley novel of 1818, is nearly a masterpiece. This grand and imaginative film makes a profound moralistic statement about the consequences of tampering with nature. As to the source, this famous novel was inspired by a real life dream and created by Shelley at the surprisingly young age of 19. Though the film has no music soundtrack, it's works very effectively without one, due to it's excellent style and technique. Direction, cinematography, art design and makeup all come together to create this impressive film.The film is based on part of the famous Shelley novel, in which an obsessed scientist creates life from the reassembled body parts of corpses.Boris Karloff portrays the character with sensitivity, compassion, including childlike innocence and wonder. This became the most famous role of his career. Legendary makeup genius Frank Pierce created an inspired monster with attention to detail, definitely an important detail in the film's success.One odd thing about the film, is that the village in the story appears to be Germany, though the original novel was written in England and director James Whale is English. The characters in the story are all recognizably English. Whale uses painted backgrounds along with imaginative sets to tell his version of Frankenstein. The castle tower and the laboratory sets are impressive. The famous creation sequence in the laboratory is majestic and ranks as one of the great set pieces in motion picture film history.Made for $300,000 and grossing $12 million, the film was a smash success, that sent Universal Studios to make many more horror films during the 1930's. Now 69 years old, the film still retains it's power to impress new generations of film goers.",Frankenstein
190,arturmachado-29588,A classic to be treasured and respected,7,23 August 2017,"For one of the first talked movies, the performances are very reasonable, but who steals the show is really 'the monster' Boris Karloff with his image and interpretation. With little more than 1 hour in duration, there are few dead moments and the film manages to grab attention from beginning to end mainly for not losing time with secondary issues unrelated to the plot, but also due to its theme and its victorian-ghotic atmosphere. Unfortunately near the end there are some plot holes: how did that man knew that whoever killed the little girl had been the monster?, how come the little girl could not swim if she lived near a lake or was the lake so much deep so near the shore that she could not reach it?, how did the monster passed unnoticed by the village then found and entered the house of its creator, no less? But apart from these cuts in the narrative (that's me being picky, I know) and the very last scene that does not fit the atmosphere of the movie, this film is a classic to be treasured and respected. So I'm really glad it's still very alive among the cinephile community so many years after its creation :)",Frankenstein
191,dagonseve,Classic,8,18 April 2010,"It's actually kind of surprising that I've never taken the time to sit down and watch this classic since I'm such a huge fan of the genre. I'm also a fan of Boris Karloff. I've seen 1994's Frankenstein (with Robert Deniro playing the role of the Monster) years ago and thought it was superb, but this is coming from a person who has never read the novel that was first published in 1818 by Mary Shelley. Look, I'm almost finished Le Fantôme de l'Opéra by Gaston Leroux – give me some time to improve my culture!Dr. Henry Frankenstein is an ex-medical student who creates and re- animates a monster – everything from old body parts dug up in a cemetery to the brain of a criminal he stole from the laboratory of his old mentor, Dr. Waldman. Henry's fiancée is worried about his reclusive behavior and seeks to intervene in his affairs at the tower in which the experiment takes place. After the monster is brought to life (It's alive!), it escapes and causes panic among the local villagers. The ending of the tale is tragic, but one that is still recreated within horror movies today. It's worth mentioning that before the film begins, a gentleman comes out on stage and warns the audience of the horror to ensure. I know for a fact that this was parodied twice – once, on an old Halloween episode of The Simpsons back in the early/mid 90's, and again serving as the intro to Rob Zombie's dark and sexually-exploitative cartoon, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto (2009).This movie, along with 1931's Dracula, are widely recognized as classics brought to you by Universal Studios. Depending on your level of patience, however, movies like this might have a difficult time relating to the audiences of today. I've heard critiques of this film claiming it to be ""boring,"" ""overrated,"" and ""not scary."" I don't accept the latter as a valid objection to the film's importance. It's simple to admit that not everyone prefers to exercise a strong insight when dealing with films, and it is for this reason that horror movies especially have a difficult time withstanding the test of time. Unless you are appreciative of the era and the courageous innovations of the time, the question of it being ""scary"" is unfounded. To speak realistically, older films like Frankenstein lose part of their effectiveness when dealing with the mainstream viewer. What about the advancements in makeup that were discovered by talented artists in the '30's? What about the set design? Does anyone mention the acting? If people aren't willing to accept that it took a tremendous amount of talent to make this film possible, then that's fine – just don't come crying to me when the recent summer blockbuster is worthless tripe.",Frankenstein
192,thebrandedswordsman-34028,It's alive...,8,26 August 2019,"Many won't be impressed by this movie because it's so old, but I say it's definitely a classic. I love the characters, the set design, the makeup on the monster, and the story. There's only a few moments where the acting is a bit off, and the movie isn't very accurate to the novel. But other than that, it's a pretty solid film",Frankenstein
193,tyson-hunsaker,The great classic horror of horrors.,9,1 November 2017,"""Frankenstein"" is considered one of the most iconic and powerful horror stories ever told. It's a film focused on tone and ideas and follows the determined and insane Dr. Frankenstein in his mission to create a monster. Numerous versions of the story have caught the public's eye but none have captured the horror and themes so clearly and with precision as does the 1931 classic by James Whale. The film succeeds at condensing Mary Shelley's epic novel into a contained 1 hour and 10 minute film. Since much was cut about Dr. Frankenstein's origin, the film feels comfortably paced and never seems to drag. The film's editing style is one that probably felt fast paced for it's time given the faster cuts and quick story progression. Exciting editing rhythm combined with beautifully lit cinematography create a memorable image of Frankenstein that still remains influential to this day. The performances by Boris Karloff and Colin Clive are very noteworthy to consider. Clive presents a doctor who's drive and passion drives himself into insanity. Before realizing the terror of his creation, his performance feels so authentically unsettling, you wonder if the actor himself has undergone a transformation of madness. The story of Frankenstein endures through the ages because of it's thought-provoking ideas about life and death, creation, work, and the monstrous nature inside us all. With the birth of a mindless and deformed monster, we see how the people treat the monster and why. We see how he reacts and ask ourselves ""Who is the monster?"" The dreadful image of the monster asks what the meaning of life and death is and what meaning does the soul have. The horrific themes of the film are understandably non visual; every theme explored is disturbing from Frankenstein undertaking the mantle of God himself by creating a living thing, and the deformity that is his creation which has a mocking feeling to life itself.""Frankenstein"" is the perfect film to watch for any horror fan, especially around this time of year. It's dark and compelling to watch down to the very last frame. It leaves the viewer thinking about their own existence and what nightmares science can hold for the future.",Frankenstein
194,tonyjackie,A true horror classic,9,5 November 2006,"To say that this film was made in 1931,it is to it's credit that it still has the power to shock. I think that it is far too easy to say that it looks tame by today's standard's and I guess that it does look dated.But it is over 70 years old and that has to be remembered. It was the role that made a legend of Boris Karloff and rightly so.He manages to exude some sympathy for the poor,tortured creature and it is a master class in actions speaking louder than words. There are many great scenes of course.The first appearance of Karloff,the creation of the creature in Frankenstein's lab,the hunt for the creature.This film has had an enormous influence,alway's the sign of a true movie great.

196,Blazehgehg,Better than I expected,8,11 November 2021,"For Halloween 2020, I watched the original 1931 Dracula, and I was shocked at how flat the movie was. Messy editing, a barely coherent story... I chalked it up to the era -- that in 1931, the medium was still too new to make for a very good movie. People were still learning. So, when I loaded up Frankenstein, also from 1931, I braced myself for the worst, and... came away pleasantly surprised.It's still very much of its era. Frankenstein feels more like a really nice play put to film. Sets are impossibly huge -- every interior has vaulted ceilings 50-100 feet tall. It's outright shocking.The biggest bummer is how this movie goes out of its way to portray Doctor Frankenstein as sort of a hero. The first half of the movie is the doc being this abusive, crazed lunatic, and nobody wants to put up with him. But the moment the creature is brought to life, the narrative -- and the doc's mood -- shifts and suddenly he's the protagonist and everybody is on his side. Still, it's not hard to wring out a bit of sympathy for the creature.Overall? A lot more enjoyable than Dracula from that same year, at the very least. Some of the editing can still be a little weird here, but this is a legitimately interesting little slice of film history.I also appreciated that the Doctor calls the creature itself ""Frankenstein"" at one point. Eat it, nerds. Though the Doctor's full name here is Henry Frankenstein instead of the traditional Victor, so maybe it's a wash.",Frankenstein
197,dav07dan02,this is truly one of the all time horror classics and a big part of Hollywood's golden age of horror,10,17 October 2005,"Director: James Whale, Script: William Hurlburt, John L. Balderston, Cast: Colin Clive (Henry), Boris Karloff (?), Mae Clark (Elizabeth), Edward Van Sloan (Dr Waldman), John Boles (Victor Moritz), Dwight Frye (Fritz) Frederick Kerr (Baron)Who can forget this great film adaption of the Mary W. Shelley novel. Henry Frankenstein appears to be a decent man with a beautiful fiancée but he allowed himself to become seduced by an obsession to create life. In his quest to do so, he created a 'human' body from corpses that he and his hunchbacked assistant 'Fritz' steals from graveyards. In order to obtain a brain for his 'creation' he has Fritz steal a brain from the medical school. In doing so, Fritz gets startled by a sudden laud noise and drops the normal brain so he grabs the abnormal brain hoping his master won't notice. As a result, a monster is created. Not knowing any better, Frankenstein's monster terrorizes and creates havoc with the citizens of the village.This might just be the first great horror film to emerge during the era of 'talkie' films. I believe Universal produced Dracula first but as far as I'm consented, this is the superior film. This is the film that helped make both Karloff and Whale legends. Karloff had been in numerous films before this going back to the 1910's but he was unknown until he got cast as the monster. The success of this film made James Whale a leading director in Hollywood and enabled him to have total creative control of later films he would make such as Bride of Frankenstein and The Invesible Man. IMDb states in their trivia that Universal (Carl Leammle Jr.) wanted Bela Lugosi to play the part of the monster but he refused because their was no talking part so Whale selected Boris Karloff for the part. I can't even imagine Lugosi as the monster! The film as we see it on the Universal DVD set isn't quite how folks saw it in theater houses back in 1931 (as if I'm old enough to know!) Due to the Hays code or whatever, at least two scenes where cut. One scene was where Colin Clive says ""now I know what it is like to be God"". That line was very controversial for the time probably because it suggested that man could be like God or because Dr. Frankenstein played God by creating life. Also, the famous scene with the monster and the little girl. The film as originally seen did not show him throwing the girl into the lake. These scenes were restored for the DVD release. This film was considered shocking for the time. Ed Van Sloan warns the audience of what they are about to see at the film's beginning. There isn't hardly anyone who hasn't heard of Frankenstein as a result of this film and the novel. This film had a big impact on horror films and still holds up today. All the actors preform well. Everything from the acting to direction and set design to the make-up effects by the legendary Jack Pierce is top notch. Like the German expressionistic films that preceded this (Nosferatu, The Cabinet of Dr. Calgari etc.) this movie has a Gothic feel about it that I like.",Frankenstein

Not my particular favorite horror film from this era even, but a decent watch and hasn't dated half as badly as it could've. The lighting and special effects are pretty competent.Of course, there are legendary line deliveries contained. But what I didn't foresee was a few touching scenes, and a solid tragedy plot. It leaves some messages to reflect on, and shame on Hollywood code standards for censoring such timeless classics as this.",Frankenstein

It had a great story, interesting characters, a truly dark and gothic atmosphere, and many other factors that make this a great movie. It's truly a classic and the acting by Boris Karloff and many others bring this tale to life very well. I certainly enjoyed this more than Dracula (1931) since it took the story to places I thought was realistic and effective in progressing the story. There scenes that show the monster being cute and innocent and then kill the moment immediately, which is done very well. However, the issue with this movie is that nothing blew me away. Dracula (1931) was a movie that had some truly amazing moments here and there but it had missteps, this film didn't have any amazing moments but was solid throughout when I look at it. So, it was I guess a great movie, but missing those scenes and executions that really get to you (at least for me). 9/10.",Frankenstein
200,Supachewy,One of the Best Monster Films Ever,9,6 November 2010,"The science fiction horror film Frankenstein is directed by James Whale and stars Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, and Boris Karloff. The setting is an unidentified city and it takes place in modern day which is 1931 at the time of the film's release.The film starts out with Dr. Frankenstein (Clive) and his hunchback assistant Fritz at a cemetery. The two of them dig up a recently deceased corpse for Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, which is to create a man in the image of himself. If Frankenstein does this then he will be able to feel like God himself. Frankenstein and his assistant realize that the brain and the head of the stolen body are badly damaged so they are forced to steal a brain from Frankenstein's old teacher. When Fritz goes to steal the brain he breaks the jar containing normal brain so he takes the one that says abnormal instead. Then Dr. Frankenstein uses a machine he built that utilized a mysterious ray he discovered so the monster (Karloff) became alive...The screenplay for this film is one of the best of the horror genre. With a running time just short of seventy minutes I was doubtful the story would be strong enough for me to enjoy the film. I was pleasantly surprised though. Garrett Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh wrote the screenplay adapted from Mary Shelley's novel. Dr. Frankenstein and the monster were both very strong characters, I liked how savage and animal like the monster was and Frankenstein's obsession. All the supporting cast were pretty one dimensional though, but it did not stop the film from being great. The quote from Dr. Frankenstein ""It's alive"" will always be embedded in my brain now.James Whale's direction was superb which really surprised me. I find for most older films that the direction is always rather simple, but this had many complex shots. The one that comes to my mind first is the father entering town holding his daughter. The camera dollies with him and the audience is able to see everyone in the city looking at him. It was just a beautiful shot. The whole entire scene where the monster comes alive is excellent as well. As the unborn corpse rises to the sky and stays at the top for a few seconds then slowly comes down just kept me on the edge of my seat. And then when the monster's hand twitches slightly, just wonderful. The final scene that I loved was when the monster is playing with the little girl. It was so simple, and that is what made the scene so effective because the monster was so simple.Whale got a couple of great performances from his actors as well. Colin Clive gave a very effective performance as the obsessed Dr. Frankenstein. I could feel his passion and desire to create something so he too could feel like God. He absolutely shined in the scene where the monster came alive, if he did a poor job there the film may not be as legendarily well known as it is today. Mae Clarke did not do anything spectacular in her role as Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé. She basically just kept on telling Frankenstein to stop being crazy and come back home, she had a one layered character which is not her part. The thing with her performance though is I do not even remember her in the film that well because unlike Clive she did not put any passion into her performance. Now Boris Karloff made the film and character iconic. He played the role as the monster and played it perfectly, there was no way he or anyone else could have done it. The scene where he acts the best is the scene with the little girl, because he is trying to play with her, not be a monster and kill her. Just magnificent performance. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job, but no one really stood out or added much to the film.This film is a classic and will always be remembered as one of the greatest monster films ever. You won't scream or jump in your seat while watching this because even though it is horror it is more like an intriguing story about a killer monster which has to go in the genre of horror. It is just a fantastic film of obsession that leads to a new creature, that does not know right from wrong. The monster is just like a wild animal, it is just trying to protect itself. Overall I give this film a 9/10 and recommend it to anyone who likes classic films, science fiction, and monster movies.",Frankenstein
201,jhigginbotham151,"Its Alive, Its Alive!",9,8 May 2014,"Frankenstein is what I would call a damn near perfect film. Every scene is memorable. If someone asked you to give them a detailed plot of Frankenstein, you could do it. Every scene is crafted with such careful plotting and detail that you cant help but be sucked in by how well Director James Whale creates such a memorable film.Boris Karloff, do I need to introduce this man, do I?. He is a man who could be captivating spouting lines about life and death (ala The Man They Could Not Hang), but also when saying nothing at all, like when he plays the monster himself, yes the monster, not Frankenstein, the monster. Karloff gives the monster a sad humanity, the fact he just wants to be accepted is such a relatable feeling that we start to feel sympathy for this supposed monster. He isn't evil, he's misunderstood, even the killing of the young child wasn't done in cold blood, it was an accident, when he finds out he panics and runs away, like a young child who never intended to do anything wrong. Karloff is rightly remembered for his role as the monster, one of the greatest silent portrayals of a man who just wants peace, and to be left alone most of all.Colin Clive portrays Dr. Henry Frankenstein, a man who is infatuated with life, obsessed with wanting to create life from parts of the dead. Clives performance is no doubt where the mad scientist trope came from, he is very intense in everything he does, going slightly mad from trying to do something that no man has ever dreamed. He is however a very sympathetic character. His intentions are noble, trying to find the secret of eternal life, to help mankind. Of course he also wants to be respected in his field but unlike others who create monsters, he never intended to use his creation for evil. Once he sees what trying to create life has done, the monster he created and how it has affected him and his relationship with his wife, he repents from ever trying to toy with the natural order of life and death again. Clive really does rival Karloff for best performance of the film.Dwight Fry as Fritz is another performance that could rival Clive and Karloff. He's such a strange character, a character thats motives are never really clear, maybe thats why I like him so much. Dwight Fry never did get the recognition he deserved, his roles in subsequent films were whittled down to cameos, and by the time he died in 1943 I don't believe anyone really remembered him. Shame, he was easily alongside the best when it came to horror films.Overall, Frankenstein is captivating cinema. A film that is still remembered, loved and revered by people around the world, even after more than 80 years. A film that truly deserves the title of classic.",Frankenstein

207,jbirtel,OR...PART 1 ! Bride of Frankenstein concludes the Story (or does it??),8,18 September 2002,"Considering that sound in the movies had only been around for a just over 2 years; film language (with sound) was not yet recognized as an art form (most directors hadn't figured out proper film language yet...come to think of it, most directors still haven't), this movie has a proper place as a pioneer of a chilling story that, despite its age, is well told...and for two reasons: James Whales's direction and Boris Karloff!This movie creeks with age! It's very ""Stage-like"" !! (from the opening shot with Edward Van Sloan's intro, complete with the actor parting the curtains to warn the obvious audience...he never looks directly into the camera...to the final shot). It's theatrically 'overacted' (but NOT by Karloff). And it has no music score, which in a creepy kind of way...works without it.Yet this movie still entertains, in a way that entertains adults AND children. James Whale put many subtleties (influenced by his sexual preferences), and does it brilliantly! The Creation scene; where the watch tower is shown against the thundering clouds...as if it represents 'BLANK' thrusting its way into the womb (the storm) that ultimately gives birth to the Monster. And the comic relief provided by 'Old Baron Frankenstein' who suspects that his son's absence is the result of 'another woman' (when, in reality, Henry isn't around because of another 'man-made'...man!). For the children: most instantly see the Monster as misunderstood and abused. And that is the result of Karloff's sympathetic and non-horror approach to his performance.If Mary Shelly's novel was more faithfully adapted, arguably, it would not have worked as well (the novel's creature speaks 'upper class' English better than anyone I know). But if you see 'Frankenstein', along with its sequel 'Bride of Frankenstein', (in one sitting), the two films capture the essence of the novel's portrayal of the Monster's loneliness and his longing for love and companionship. History shows that neither film, both directed by Whale, is independent of each other. Together, they tell a complete story!Great sets!(the creation; the mountains; Universal Studio's back lot).And no one can play Frankenstein's Monster like Boris Karloff. No one ever will!8.5 out of 10 ! A Classic!",Frankenstein
208,larrysmile1,This is not the original Frankenstein movie!,8,3 October 2001,"In 1910 the famous father of the electric light bulb and inventor extraordinary, Thomas Alva Edison in association with J. Searle Dawley are credited with directing the 16 minute short version of ""Frankenstein."" There were only three actors, The Monster, Dr. Frankenstein, and Elizabeth. According to the review for that movie, there is only one print still in existence owned by a private collector.Thus, this 1931 version has become known as the ""original"" Frankenstein movie put to film from Mary Shelly's book. Although I have viewed this movie many times over the past 50 years, I didn't realize that it had many ""campy"" parts to it until I watched it for this review. The opening credits are silly with the many ""eyes"" revolving around a face. The American Movie Classics host stated that Bela Lugosi was originally offered the part of the ""Monster"" but because there were no speaking lines (other than monster grunts) and it required the monster character to wear 40 pounds of makeup and props/shoes, neck bolts, etc., Mr. Lugosi turned down the part. All the better. Mr. Lugosi made a premiere Dracula in that same year and Boris Karloff was of a taller stature to better play ""The Monster.""Colin Clive is not believable as a German Baron's son, Henry Frankenstein. He acts too British. Henry is too British a name. I prefer the character to be called Victor von Frankenstein. I think he became famous for his almost hysterical fanatical cry of ""It's alive!"" As, Gene Wilder makes fun of this in the comedy version of ""Young Frankenstein."" The hunchback lab assistant is misnamed. Although called ""Fritz"" which passes for German, the name ""Igor"" better fits the role! Dwight Frye is the tormentor of the monster by whipping him with a bull whip and teasing him with fire. The monster hangs him for these acts. Dwight Frye gave a better and more rememberable performance in the more important role of the lunatic and fly-eating Renfield in the movie Dracula! ""We're here, Master! (maniacal laugh coming from the ship's hold).""Dr. Waldman, Dr. Frankenstein's university professor is played by Edward van Sloan. The monster strangles him! Mr. van Sloan is also remembered for his critical portrayal of Professor Van Helsing as Dracula's nemesis.
Fredrick Kerr as Baron von Frankenstein is also too British in his demeanor. His character is too self-centered and thinks that the towns people are like little ""pets"" when they all show up for the wedding of young Henry Frankenstein to Elizabeth.Elizabeth, (Mae Clarke) also is too British. Of course, it's easier for her to get away with it because she could be British and not having any other family there for the wedding. Maybe she's an orphan or a liberated woman of the times! We can tell that John Boles as Victor Moritz loves Elizabeth. In fact, Elizabeth knows it and brushes off his attempt at showing his affection when he fawns all over her while they are sitting on the sofa. He hangs on her every breath. Henry von Frankenstein, however, knows that his friend Victor has amorous feelings for Elizabeth. When Henry leaves to kill the monster he entrusts Victor to take care of Elizabeth with a look to suggest that ""if I get killed you marry her!""We all remember the scene of Ludwig carrying his dead little Maria into the village during the wedding celebration. Michael Mark received no screen credits for his vivid but short appearance so we now credit him for all to know. Marilyn Harris played little Maria. The monster threw her into the lake where she drowned and not down a well as some may think!Let's not forget the righteous indignation of Herr Burgomaster played by Lionel Belmore. By the time he organizes the search/lynching party it's nightfall and they all take off into the woods and mountains with torches and hounds to find the monster. Really bright, huh!Somehow, we tend to believe that medical school dropout Frankenstein created his monster in an old castle. It was a run down and abandoned ""watch tower"" (look-out) on top of a mountain.No, the Monster did not die in the fire at the windmill. Otherwise we would not have 89 more ""Frankenstein"" movies made about the same story!Somehow, the casting of characters did not come to fruition until the beautiful Teri Garr (Inga) teams up with the comedy genius of Gene Wilder as Herr Baron Victor von Frankenstein and his legendary assistant ""Igor"" (pronounced ""eye-gor"") Marty Feldman and Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn). Peter Boyle is a sympathetic monster. Now, this is a real Frankenstein worthy of a 10!I gave the 1931 version an ""8"" because of it's being too British-y! Mr. Karloff, of course, deserves a ""10.""",Frankenstein
209,carljessieson,Frankenstein isn't even the name of the monster :O,8,30 March 2015,"Definitely deserves its title as a classic! What a fun monster movie, and an important one considering it was among the first of its kind. The whole thing was great. Amazing production design- the sets are amazing, props are creepy, and the setting is perfect. The special effects are creative and effective, occasionally silly but they did great for what they had. The cinematography was well done also. The variety of shooting techniques/angles utilized exceeds those of my recent viewings of films from around this time. The use of light and shadows was impeccable, felt its influence permeate the mood of every single scene. It's so.put-together-looking. Every detail was considered, and it's clear a lot of work went into this film! The performances were excellent all around. Dr. Frankenstein was the ideal mad scientist. Not excessively bananas, like ridiculously so- just the right amount. Intelligent, handsome, proper young man who just happens to have freaky ambitions when it comes to his career, or his legacy more appropriately. The monster was also brilliantly performed. Outstanding. Dope reveal of the monster. What an iconic moment. I can't imagine what it felt like to be in a theater watching this in 1931, wow. The movie also features some bomb symbolism, adds a few layers to the cake. Great hair, make-up, and costumes. Appropriate for the era, and creepy at the same time. The story-telling was good! The script certainly didn't waste any time, in good and bad ways. There were points where the plot progressed too quickly/nonsensically (i.e. characters make enormous assumptions based on fragments of information, wholeheartedly invest themselves in them and their plans of action in response, and are correct somehow), but generally it was paced well. I recommend it. I'm sure I'll watch it again someday but I'm not in a rush to add it to my collection. 8/10 Bye love you",Frankenstein
210,TheFinalAlias,A film just as tragically misunderstood as it's monster.,10,6 March 2009,"While certainly leagues ahead of Browning's ""Dracula"", Whale's Frankenstein still creaks aplenty, and in comparison to it's two sequels it looks primitive indeed, and yet....of all the Universal horrors, this is the most compelling and timeless.I find it ironic how, in discussions of the Frankenstein legend, this film is often considered as just a footnote only worth discussing for the influence it had on physical depictions of the monster, and dismissed in favor of Branagh's ""adaption"" or Fisher's excellent ""Curse of Frankenstein"". The rationale is often that those versions are more faithful to the book. But I disagree, and if you care to read, I'll explain why.I will admit, firsthand, that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes, however I feel that the changes, despite their minimal size, are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version, He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his ""F--- the rich"" subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot, but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has, with the exception of ""Frankenstein: The True Story"" and Fisher's ""Frankenstein must be Destroyed"". One big complaint, is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster; pure tripe in my opinion.If anything; Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a ""criminal brain"" by Fritz, but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason, and he isn't. First, ""abnormal brain of the typical criminal"" could mean anything given the period's beliefs, perhaps the man in question was mentally ill, or had killed in self-defense, or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason, he does for flimsy reasons, but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz, reacts angrily, is taunted, then attacks. Frankenstein, unwilling to take responsibility, has the creature locked away to be ""disciplined"" by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then, his murders are in self-defense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecution(likely, but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback), but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points, to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences, and feels no remorse until later, it becomes clear that, monster or not, he's a control-freak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to ""make him my companion""(plenty of child-abductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life), then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder. In contrast, the film's Creature gently plays with a little girl, but accidentally drowns her, and dies at the hands of a mob who really DON'T have any proof he's guilty, in a scene reminiscent of both a Klan lynching and Christ's crucifixion. Yeah, what an 'unsympathetic' character in comparison to the book(Rolls eyes).Both characters are unpredictable and dangerous, but does Karloff's Creature really come off as unsympathetic just because he doesn't talk endlessly like the novel's monster? Would you rather pity the equivalent of Ted Bundy because he can talk rather than the equivalent of Lenny from ""Of Mice & Men"" because he cannot? I also want to point out how, name change and assistant aside, Colin Clive's portrayal of Frankenstein comes closer, personality wise, than any others. Clive is criticized for his hammy ""It's Alive!"" line, but in the novel, Frankenstein raves like that for SEVERAL CHAPTERS. This film doesn't take the easy way out by making Frankenstein into a monster-hunting hero(Branagh) or into a 19th century Lex Luthor(Fisher); he's like Shelley's portrayal; basically well-meaning and fully blessed with all any man could want, but secretive, callous, neglectful, and unwilling to see consequences until it's either too late or too early. I think Clive's otherwise restrained portrayal fares better than Branagh's, who overacts ""It's Alive"" style in EVERY scene. The fact that Karloff inspires more fear and more pity with a few grunts than De Niro does in Branagh's whole movie is also telling.So what exactly is the problem with Whale's film? It features the most spiritually accurate Dr. Frankenstein ever, drives home the themes of the plot better than any other version, the accusation that the monster is unsympathetic is horse ca ca since he's more sympathetic than he is in the actual novel, so what's to hate? The best answer is to visit the comments section for this movie under ""hated"" and the comment's under ""loved"" for Branaghs. 99.9% of the complaints are by children who hate it because it's an old movie in black & white, or who make homophobic comment's about James Whale(who was gay). The people who like the Branagh movie mostly just love it because it's in color, or because they are teenage English lit fan girls who think Branagh is hot, and any movie with attractive leads HAS to be better right? If they say they like it because it's more faithful they are lying because they never read it, or did read it but didn't like it, and therefore have no right to demand fidelity to source material they didn't like themselves.This movie isn't perfect, but of the 3 films I've cited as being the best spiritual adaptations, it's the best. Simply; it's the greatest Frankenstein movie ever made as of now.~",Frankenstein
211,zurnderrick,Classic Horror,10,19 September 2009,"In honor of the Halloween season approaching, I find it a great time to review one of my favorite sci-fi/horror films of all time. Frankenstein by James Whale is very different from Mary Shelley's original 1831 novel. Frankenstein's monster doesn't talk like he does in the novel, and Victor Frankenstein is renamed Henry Frankenstein. But even though it has major differences, it is still and epic classic.Everything about this film is something to enjoy, every scene well thought out and designed. The iconic scene with Frankenstein clinging from the operating table is one of the most epic scenes of all time. Even Darth Vader does it in Revenge of the Sith.In the end, Frankenstein is one of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time, and just goes to show you that movies based off books with a quadrillion things different can still turn out to be beloved classics.",Frankenstein
212,pitsburghfuzz,Classic Monster Movie,10,7 August 2009,"""We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation – life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even – horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to – uh, well, we warned you"". -Edward Van Sloan.Although this movie does not shock or thrill, it fascinates. The movie's cast is well worth repeating, Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, ETC. The movie contains obvious hints to German Expressionism, as the production team was inspired by films like Nosferatu, or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The Gothic style fits the setting and the sets work beautifully. This movie would forever solidify Frankenstein in media and launched Boris Karloff into stardom. Although there is no musical score,it still works well without it as the horrifying scenes are much more emphasized than if it had music. All in all, this is a movie everyone should see, if you haven't seen it, go ahead and view this masterpiece. If you have seen it, now is the time for you to watch it again.

James Whale, the director, shows genius in every film he's ever directed. Boris Karloff, with the aid of his makeup man, is the most grusome and just plain scary of all film creations.

215,angelicseven,The unforgettable Frankenstein rendition,10,28 July 2012,"James Whale's black & white Frankenstein (1931) movie remains a timeless masterpiece and the most remembered of all. It is without a doubt what kept people fascinated in Mary Shelley's story for years. You could tell the way the movie was put together, that highlights every scene to be thought provoking and intriguing; all a labor of love. Boris Karloff who portrayed the monster also had an important part in the movie's success. For you couldn't help but feel sorry for the monster who was hated, feared and misunderstood. What escapes me, as I'm sure others have also wondered, is why did Dr. Frankenstein felt it was utmost important to create life from death in the first place? When Bride of Frankenstein (1935) came out you finally get a clue that maybe there was a race ongoing race in medical science over the secrets of life and death. I don't know if anyone has gather this but it seems like the author Mary Shelly had interwoven her own birth as like the created monster, which was own mother's fatal undoing, much like Dr. Frankenstein. One has to question whether she might of heard of the real Dr. Frankenstein who tried to create a formula that when taken internally was suppose to give him eternal life. But unfortunately actually created poison, which slowly brought about his own demise. The sudden death of Shelley's mom at her own birth had to have been something she never fully got over and must of really got to her is why she ended up getting the nightmare that inspired the story. Superstitious people back then might of also helped incite the nightmare, as though her type of birth could of been thoughtful as like some kind of bad luck. The Frankenstein concept also seems to be a warning that what we create today that suppose to help us could very well become our own undoing. Which is brought out more clearly in James Cameron's Terminator movies. Interesting how both this classic Frankenstein (1931) & Terminator (1984) movie was created by persons both named James. Both movies a success, timeless masterpiece, intriguing and thought provoking. Like Mary Shelley, James Cameron's dream inspired the story concept Terminator, into a movie. What I liked and appreciated was finding out that James Whale made his Frankenstein movie cause nothing else interest him and he certainly didn't want to do any war pictures.",Frankenstein
216,Royalcourtier,Intelligent horror - a lost genre,9,1 June 2013,"Frankenstein was a seminal movie. It was in many ways the first modern horror film. But is also marked the beginning of a decline. The subsequent Frankenstein films were poor copies. Other monster movies emphasised the horror and the deaths. The original film was a tale of a scientist dabbling in things that were forbidden. Secrets that cannot be kept secret. A monster that will inevitably destroy its creator. Along with the horror elements, there was pathos and humour. Who can forget the innocent playful interaction of the Monster with little Maria, ending with her unintended death? Frankenstein was an intelligent movie, something too rare these days. Perhaps its intelligence was because in many ways it was a British movie - with a English director and the two leading actors. Do not remake this movie, it would be a mistake. Watch the original, it cannot be improved upon.",Frankenstein
217,km_dickson,A horror classic,8,13 August 2005,"A horror classic well deserving of its acclaim. This film could have been tossed off as schlock, but Director James Whale gave it the quality and craftsmanship of an A class movie. That made all the difference. Whale refrains from revealing the Monster too early. In the scene where it comes alive, we see only the thing's hand as it starts moving. Later we hear it roaming through the empty castle in the background while a dialogue scene plays out. The buildup is done so well that when the Monster finally appears in a dark, low angle shot, coming through a creaking door, it is one of the best reveals in film history. Boris Karloff is magnificent as the Monster (even if most of the credit should go to the costume and makeup artists). Wonder, anger, panic, fear and vengefulness he conveys all through his wordless performance. He is intimidating at just the right times and pitiable at others. The film comes in at just over an hour, which is really a shame. Whale definitely could have gotten more out of another half hour, and the cast was decent enough to deserve some more character development. Nonetheless, black and white horror films don't get any better than this.",Frankenstein
218,d-snake1,A classic that still holds up today,8,4 October 2018,"Frankenstein, a movie primarily about how Doctor Henry Frankenstein deals with the fallout of his monster actually coming to life, holds up very well almost ninety years from its release.Starting with the monster itself, we find a fantastic character. Without any lines of dialogue, the filmmakers and Boris Karloff had to use actions and emotions to display the motivations of the monster, and they did a fantastic job of it. The fear, confusion, and longing that the novel describes are evident in the monster's actions, to the point of pushing the audience to root for him.The rest of the characters are also a bit of fun. Baron Frankenstein, played by Fred Kerr, was also a hoot. He played a no-nonsense character that functioned well in the comic-relief role needed with Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Wladman and Mae Clarke's Elizabeth being quite serious, even dramatic. Colin Clive, the man who played Doctor Henry, did a decent job in his role as well, pulling off the role of being consumed by his work, even when he desired to be free from it. The acting, overall, was a touch more theatrical than I would prefer in a horror movie, but it wasn't so distracting that it pulled me out of the film. The film is a ton of fun to watch, but I do have to say it isn't exactly terrifying. The atmospheric creepiness is somewhat lacking compared to modern-era horror, even going back fifty years. That being said, the movie, if thought about and rewatched, does a good job of displaying how the fear of the unknown, and letting that fear take over, can be the real monster.",Frankenstein
219,cassiewright-89520,Quick and To the Point,8,26 March 2020,"With the runtimes of today's movies bordering on the laughable, 1931's Frankenstein is a great example of knowing where to come into a story and when to leave. It's short, to the point, and still very effective.The story, if you even need to know at this point, revolves around a mad doctor with a God complex wanting to create human life by using dead tissue from cadavers and re-animating it. Obviously, things don't go according to plan and he ends up creating a monster who gets loose and terrorizes the entire town.Is it still as terrifying as moviegoers in the 30's thought it was? Probably not. The sight of Karloff in full makeup isn't going to make us hide behind our chairs like it did for our grandparents, but its still a tight, well made film.",Frankenstein
220,ACitizenCalledKane,The quintessential monster movie...A classic!,8,5 January 2005,"""It's alive, it's alive, it's alive!"" In fact, despite being more than seventy years old, this film is still very much alive. James Whale's Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies of all time. Bolstered by Boris Karloff's spectacular portrayal of the Monster, Jack P. Pierce's incredible talent as a make-up artist, and Colin Clive's mad Dr. Frankenstein, this version of Mary Shelley's masterpiece remains unmatched by the countless films that have sought to recreate its magic. Boris Karloff brings so much depth and sensitivity to the creature that it is often difficult to call him a monster. This is a rare achievement, playing the ""villain"" in a film so well that the audience can relate to him, or feel for him. Who has not felt misunderstood, lost, confused, rejected, or even despised at some point in their lives? If not all of us, then I would imagine, most of us. Karloff's ability to show a bit of humanity from behind his menacing make-up is truly astonishing. I could not help but feel pity for the Monster when Fritz (Dwight Frye, who also played Renfield in Universal's Dracula that same year) tortured him with the torch. At times like these, you must ask who is the monster here? Is it the creature brought back to life by no desire of his own? Is it the insanely over-ambitious Dr. Frankenstein who cannot see life as more than a vehicle for his experimentation? One could certainly argue that Fritz was a monster, based on his cruel treatment of the monster. Not all monsters choose to be what they are perceived to be. Some monsters, as in this case, are created by true monsters. You could say that I have read a little too much into all of this, but I mention it because I think that a great movie makes you think, makes you ask questions, and this movie does those things. With its impressive performances and amazing (albeit, for its time) special effects, and endless influence on subsequent monster/horror movies, James Whale's Frankenstein is a classic not to be missed!",Frankenstein
221,beardedmovieguy,Monster Royalty,8,14 March 2015,"This movie comes off as silly at times and brilliant at others, but it is probably considered to be one of the greatest monster movies of all time. The greatest thing to come out of this movie was the performance of Boris Karloff as the monster, it is just incredible how much emotion and feeling he was able to convey while under all that makeup. The direction of James Whale is spot on with a great use of sets and outdoor locations, in fact, the only real flaw in the film lies in the script, which has a few situations that make very little sense and because of which interrupts the films flow. But other than that, Frankenstein is a classic and very important movie, and it launched Karloff on to a great career, plus the sequel Bride Of Frankenstein is even better. 4 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomHi6vIds4",Frankenstein

The monster is beautifully realized by Karloff, the direction is excellent by Whale, and the pacing is so well done that modern filmmakers should be forced to look at the film.  The main problems are some of the performances (besides the lead and Clive, the rest of the cast is typical of early talkies) and the dialogue, which is laughable in the dramatic scenes. Still, the film carries some real power and has pointed the way for every horror film made in the past 70 years.  Interestingly enough, the sequel is better.",Frankenstein
223,mcrpghk,"Frankenstein is the real monster, or not...",8,7 March 2021,"The debate that the film tries to pass on to the viewer is clear, would the monster be a reflection of its creator? Or is he defective because he came from human hands? Of course the excuse that the brain used for the creation of the creature would be from a bad person impacts on our perspective upon it, but the film makes it clear that the Monster is nothing more than a child without any knowledge, which I particularly find funny since the doctor would have thought of everything to create a new life , but seems to have forgotten that all beings are born without any knowledge.The creature looks more like a frightened animal that seeks to know the world than in fact a man, in the iconic scene where he throws the girl into the lake for example, it is clear that he understands that what he did was wrong, but what I believe to be more curious about all this is that after that he does not seem to run away out of fear , but rather to seek help, it would not be a coincidence that he went to the place where there was the greatest accumulation of people, but it is interesting that he had sought first approach with a familiar face (Elizabeth), again he is violent, either because he suffered from fritz's abuses in the castle which created this mode of approach or by the link with the violent man from which his brain comes.Yet the part that fascinates me most in the film, is that when the creature meets its creator, the approach at first sight is aggression or revenge if you prefer, however, when the monster takes Victor to the house at the end of the mountain, I could not help but see a relationship between a frightened son seeking answers from his mother , ""why was I raised? Why was I treated badly? Why did you leave me? Why do you want to hurt me?"" Unfortunately, thanks to every chaotic situation that clash is decided with violence and with the death of the creature, who was born for the selfish purposes of a mad man, and died in a frightening way without even knowing the reason for its existence.For me, the question that remains is this: Would Victor Frankenstein be a monster for creating a creature from a malicious mind? Or just a man trying to emulate God for the advancement of science and human life?",Frankenstein

Yes, it's acting style, still influenced by silent film, seems odd now. Yes, it no longer frightens anyone, except perhaps the very young.  But this film is the blueprint, the basic skeleton, for how you construct a horror film. It's surface simplicity and very brevity belie just how complex it is.  It may surprise you to know this is one of the most discussed films in history. It works on the subconscious the same way many classic fairy tales do. Once seen, whether you like it or not, it is not forgotten.  The Karloff monster is one of the world's most recognizable images.  Its Gothic stateliness and expressionistic black and white photography continue to be an influence.  If you cannot appreciate these things, then you must leave it alone.

225,theblackscythe,Horror's first real masterpiece of the sound era.,9,21 October 2014,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #10) Frankenstein is one of the most dazzling horror films of the entire 1930's. It is also one of the best films of 1931, a contender for being one of the best years in cinema history (at least in my opinion). It has aged beautifully and remains amongst the most iconic and recognisable horror films ever. So why has it withstood the test of time so much better than 'Dracula' (which came out the same year)? Firstly, the film takes full advantage of the new sound technology at its disposal. The awkward and clunky lack of a score in Dracula is replaced here by an atmospheric and grand orchestral score, which matches the action on the screen perfectly. To me, this helps to show just how ahead of the game director James Whale really was.Next, the film's acting remains strong and has only slightly aged. Boris Karloff gives the performance that would launch one of the greatest careers in horror cinema. His portrayal of the creature is as perfect as Lugosi's Dracula, utterly flawless. Dwight Fry is enjoyable once again (however I will admit that his material is lacking compared to Dracula), as is Colin Clive in one of the most underrated performances in early horror. His demented yet tortured stare and physically involved acting style is totally engrossing, grabbing the audience by the collar and not releasing for 70 minutes. The rest of the cast is strong also and generally their performances hold up stronger than the supporting performances in Dracula.The film's set design is wonderful and is defiantly one of its key draws. From the iconic lab set, as ingrained in our cultural memories as anything else in horror cinema, to the atmospheric graveyard set the film opens on. The film looks gorgeous and I will often find myself pausing the film to drink the ambiance they provide in. Unlike Dracula, the film never loses steam in this department, offering 70 whole minutes of beautiful painted backgrounds and perfectly balanced sets.Overall Frankenstein is a masterpiece. Its ending is one of the most intense sequences in early horror, and James Whales darkly witty signature permeates every layer of the film. Kenneth Branagh's embarrassment does not deserve to share a name with this slice of cinematic wonderment.",Frankenstein
226,Evil_Magus,"Terrible Adaptation, Classic Film.",8,27 July 2006,"One thing must be said about Frankenstein (1931) before it is watched. This is a terrible adaptation of Mary Shelly's novel ""Frankenstein or: A Modern Prometheus"". Except for the fact that there was a Frankenstein who created a ""monster"" from corpses and brought it to life, which then escaped and began terrorizing the countryside, there is almost nothing in common. The ""Monster"" is not the intelligent and murderous creature from the book, but rather a hulking brute. Victor (Henry, in the movie) does not abandon the creature, he doesn't travel to the North Pole to hunt it down, he doesn't converse with an explorer who finds him and he doesn't die. Victor's Father, bride and everybody else who's connected to him all live, instead of dying as they would have in an accurate rendition.This, simply put, is not Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This is John L. Balderston's Frankenstein, this is James Whale's Frankenstein... this is a different story. This must be understood beforehand, so that no confusion can be made. This is different.That being said, this movie is deservedly a classic, an excellent and brilliant example of early-sound film. The direction is excellent. James Whale knows exactly where and when to point the camera, how to instruct the crew, what everybody needs to be doing. The acting is incredible.Colin Clive's performance is nothing short of perfect. He shows Henry's (Victor's) troubled mind, his romantic and sentimental disposition, and his descent into suffering as the ""monster"" runs free. He perfectly portray's Frankenstein's complex: he's an over-achiever; he creates a creature that can revolutionize science and medicine, but it is beyond his ability to cope and comes to terms with the abomination, with his ""Foul Abortion"". To date, this is one of my favorite performances in any film.Boris Karloff gives an equally superior and classic performance as the naive and innocent ""monster"", a creature who through no fault of his own weaves a path of terror, death and destruction everywhere he goes. Wihtout words, he conveys the creature's every thought, every fear, every emotion, with only grunts and body-language to aid him. In fact, the timing of the film, on the advent of ""talkies"", is an asset to the feature; just after a time when body-language was quite literally the only way that an actor could speak to his audience.The rest of the acting, while not nearly as incredible as these two leads, was far above average. While some of the parts themselves left something to desire, their performance and execution was utterly flawless. In fact, it was one of the all-around better acted films, as a whole, that I've seen.The sets were quite excellent. While it was always perfectly obvious when there was a back-drop, and equally obvious that this was filmed in its entirety within studio-walls, the sets were quite impressive. The windmill, Frankenstein's tower, the Baron's home... all of them were beautifully designed and created. The special effects, for the day, blew me away, as did the sound-effects. I was utterly surprised how much that they could accomplish with so little to work with (especially compared with today). The make-up on Karloff's ""Monster"" was marvelous and sickening; just the way that it should be. The costumes were fitting for the characters, and Elizabeth's (Mae Clark's) dress was simply gorgeous.The score (or lack thereof) was extremely minimal. Except for the beginning, I don't believe I heard it again until the end-credits. The sound effects, however, more than made up for that silence in the background. At times, silence was even this movie's greatest strength. It allowed the mob's shouts and the character's dialog. I believe that this is the only time I can say that no score ( basically what they had) was a wiser choice than more score.Overall, this is a classic and must-see film. It's the quintessential horror movie and a masterpiece in its own right. It has stood the tests of time despite not being faithful at all to the book upon which it's based.

227,mhesselius,The brain's the thing,8,27 July 2010,"Differences between the sensitive, articulate creature in Mary Shelley's novel and the monster in the movie are not because original director Robert Florey, his replacement James Whale, and writer John Balderston dismissed Shelley's original ideas. They were working not from the novel but from Peggy Webling's dramatic adaptation. It was her changes to Shelley's novel that Baldertson dismissed. The creature in the movie is therefore twice removed from its source, its face the face of the corpse, its reactions those of a caged beast.Christopher Frayling in his otherwise excellent commentary on the latest DVD release suggests that Robert Florey's contribution to the script - the implantation into the creature of a ""criminal"" brain - makes for a less complicated and interesting story. But uncertainty about the creature's brain adds a dimension of ambiguity that didn't exist in the novel, in which the creature understandably lashes out at his creator's rejection and society's hostility. In 1931, however, the influence on this film of German cinema (the expressionist design of ""Caligari"" and ""Der Golem"") may have prompted Florey to address troubling questions about the nature of evil raised earlier that year by Peter Lorre's tortured portrayal of a child molester in Fritz Lang's ""M."" Could the killer control his impulses? And if not, is he morally guilty?Those parts of the film not scripted by Florey go even further, questioning whether a ""criminal"" brain even exists. ""After all,"" says Frankenstein to his mentor Professor Waldman, ""it's just dead tissue."" Also, a lecture Waldman delivers to students on the behavioral effects of certain ""convolutions"" characteristic of the very brain implanted in creature aren't born out by his actions. He never demonstrates the impulses one expects of a ""criminal,"" and has ample justification for killing Frankenstein's assistant who tormented him with fire, and for killing Waldman who attempted to dissect him. The most damning evidence against the creature - his inadvertent drowning of a child - is the result of his own innocence in believing she will float on the water like her flowers.Nevertheless, the creature's unsophisticated reactions to a world he does not understand make him utterly unpredictable and a real danger. He lives in a nightmare world that assaults our own senses in the wonderfully angular and expressionistic props and sets constructed by art director Charles D. Hall (who had worked with German director Paul Leni on THE MAN WHO LAUGHS three years earlier).It is easy to retrospectively dismiss this movie as tame. But in its day no one knew what the echoing footsteps in the watch tower would bring through the door. It is only because of budget sequels and performances of lesser actors than Karloff that the Frankenstein monster has become such a comfortable cliché.",Frankenstein
228,Movieman-133,Sucks...reprise(a different writer),5,18 July 1999,"Well,  what can I saw besides the movie had no entertainment value and it threw away Mary Shelley's classic novel that dealt with feelings so intimately-Guilt for instance.  This movie destroyed everything emotional of the characters and really gave Frankenstein a SUCKY name.  The effects of the film were a bore,  and I can't say the black and white helped much to the excitement.    As for the characters,  the bride and family members of Victor(titled George in this film) were completely throwaways..who cares if they die.   As for all the talk about Borois Karloff, he mumbles and groans threw the entire film.  How could someone think he was a classic actor. Why didn't they just get a dummy, put some fabric ,  and throw an old mans voice that just woke from his grave for fun. Is this acting? It was pitiful,  I didn't care for the monster at all.  The experience was completely unenjoyable and I'm sure my classmates(yes I watched this in school after the beautiful novel)  would agree.   As for the AFI list of great movies, it was only put there because it is an old classic,  it means nothing it's just a way for people to stick up for it.  This is just a really SUCKY movie with deteriorated and careless emotion.",Frankenstein

Say too what you may about the fact that this film has really nothing in common with the gorgeous novel. But please enjoy Boris Karloff, possibly the most overlooked and underrated actor in film history.  Karloff's craftfull creation is simply one of the finest performances ever lensed on film. It may be one of the two or three great performances never awarded the oscar. Largely a pantomime creation from an actor trained on stage, the creature is not only terrifying, but hauntingly human and tragic. What Karloff is able to do with just the simplest of gesture of roll of the eye is what acting is all about: telling a truthfull, electrifying and emotional story.  The academy and the industry underutilized this expert craftsman. Because of his odd looks, there was admittedly a limited market for him. However in many respects he was as good as Sir Olivier and could have been used in oh so many ways.   I urge you to take a look at this film if for no other reason than to savor an expert example of acting for the film.  A 7 out of 10",Frankenstein
230,dgeer80,One of the best,10,4 May 2004,"This is a classic monster tale of a scientist who goes mad with the idea of playing God, and regrets it after the fact. Back when this film came out, this was pretty controversial - which is sort of why Edward Van Sloan comes out from behind a curtain at the beginning of the film and warns the audience (although is is mostly just for building the mood).Anyhow, Boris Karloff IS the Frankenstein monster. Other actors that played him were okay, but Boris is the best. Him, along with Bela Lugosi's Dracula, created two of the most iconic horror images of all time.The story is very good, and scary for the time. I recently watch this one back to back with ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" and I can't decide which one's better. This one is more scary I think, but ""Bride"" is more in touch with the monster's personal and emotional side.This is a great, classic horror film that still holds up well if you look at it in its historical context. For the serious horror fan, this is a must see. For the fans of ""Young Frankenstein,"" you MUST watch this and ""Bride"" to truly understand where Mel Brooks was coming from when he made that film.Overall, 10 out of 10.",Frankenstein

Karloff takes what could have been a one note role and turns it into something almost noble. Frye shuffles through the film like a contemptible insect. Clive is at his hysterical obsessive best as the mad doctor. Other people are right that it does not follow the book, but the screenplay was actually based on a stage play that was adapted from the book. The movie actually follows the play quite closely. It has some of the technical limitations of early talkies, but it is nowhere near as creaky as Dracula.",Frankenstein

I can watch it all the time, because I never get sick of it. It is a classic in the true sense of the word, and has withstood the test of time and remains an extensive influence on all modern horror. The most recent ""Frankenstein"" was a USA made for TV movie directed by Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake's Marcus Nispel. Now, there are not many movies that are always being made and remade and remade. The eerie tale of frankenstein has existed since the 1800s when Mary Shelley wrote the class novel. Since that, Frank has been seen on the silver screen many times, including the 1950s ""Curse of Frankenstein"" with Christopher Lee but most notably James Whale's 1931 version. It is so short, only an hour and ten minutes, but so amazing. There is no music, and the acting is ridiculously over done. I don't know what it is about Frankenstein, but I love it. Colin Clive is amazing as the insane Dr. Frankenstein and Boris Karloff is just ridiculously amazing at lumbering about as the monster. What a kick ass movie.",Frankenstein
233,Deveousdevil,Horrible movie. Ruined a Classic Novel.,1,2 February 2009,"This is a very bad movie. Not only is it a horrible adaptation of the book, it itself is overall just a very bad movie. First off, even for the 1930's this is pathetic, the movie is just over an hour long. The movie changes absolutely everything that happens in the book, the acting is mediocre, the in the short time this movie plays, a lot of it is devoted to a bunch of scenes of a mob hunting after the monster. For those of you who read the book, you know that Frankenstein built the monster himself and then he woke up by himself. Here they made it that he shocked him with lighting during a storm. OK, so they wanted to add a little cooler twist, no prob. However, instead of building on the story that the monster became evil because he was rejected by humanity, he is supposedly innately evil because they accidentally use a criminal's brain. The problem is that after that, they go back to the original story of him becoming evil by bad treatment from Frankenstein's assistant. Then, later in the movie, he is having fun with a little girl and, through, stupidity, throws her into a lake and accidentally kills her. After that, the people in a the village go hunting for the monster, and he eventually faces off with Frankenstein in some windmill that get's burnt down with the monster inside. In the book, the monster learns how to speak and becomes very smart, and he hates Frankenstein because he made him so ugly etc. They made no attempt to build on the story of the monster having a personal vendetta against Frankenstein or how he wanted a female companion. In addition, the part where Frankenstein screams ""its alive!"", his movements make him look like he's having an orgasm, seriously, it looks dumb. Bottomline, this movie sucks. It's the longest hour you'll spend watching a movie.",Frankenstein

Today it is memorable only for its being the first appearance of the iconic monster played by Boris Karloff. No doubt the effect of the movie is diluted by the many imitations, notably The Munsters 1960's TV series. Today it seems like a parody of all bad horror movies, although of course it was one of the originals of the genre. The acting is very stilted and wooden and the direction by James Whale very average.

I liked this movie, although I wasn't very scared by it. I liked the use of dark and light and the use of shadow. I also noticed a few characters looking off into the horizon when they spoke (Elizabeth) which was a bit campy and a tad foreboding. An interesting point was made about the doctor playing with creating life. Someone told me they cried at the end of this, but I couldn't understand really understand why until the mob appeared and destroyed the monster, who, after all, didn't ask to be created.

The disjointed nature of Frankenstein cannot go ignored. Credit must be given to Frankenstein for helping define the monster movie genre, but it did so based purely on the gimmick and not due to the quality of the film. The star of the show is indeed Frankenstein's monster however he is absent from much of the film. In addition, Frankenstein himself goes from engrossing to lifeless without logic. This transition leaves the viewer without an engaging point of focus. By the end of the film we're left with a secondary plot unresolved and a promising premise underwhelmed. Overall, Frankenstein is satisfactory. It showed the world what was possible with monster movies...and frankly, that was all we needed to become hooked.Read my complete review (w/ possible spoilers) at CD1083.com",Frankenstein
237,bmoviep,Possibly the best retellings of a classic story in Film history,9,7 August 2018,"Telling an old story in a new way is a colossal task that many undertake, but few succeed in. Creating an original story, while staying true to the underlying themes and structure of the original is a difficult balance to maintain. However, The 1931 film adaption of ""Frankenstein"" is possibly the greatest example of a reimagined classic story told right cinematic history. The underlying themes of Mary Shelley's tale regarding whether scientific inquiry can go to far and the what makes someone a monster are preserved and relayed brilliantly through out this movie, while also forming an identity of it's own. It's because of this film that the depiction of Frankenstein's monster as dead eyed, flat headed behemoth has been the default image of horror for generations. Frankenstein is a timeless tale warning about what happens to those who fly too close to the sun, and the 1931 film adaptation more than lives up to its title.",Frankenstein
238,ChristophCinema,"Wait, there's a book?",10,5 October 2012,"One of my least favorite complaints about movies is ""it's not accurate to the book"". I hate when people say that because that's not being fair. Books and film are two completely different forms of media. Of course it's not going to be 100% accurate to the book, unlike a book, a film has dozens of people working on it, and it has to be made to fit the film format. A movie based on a book doesn't need to be 100% accurate to be good, and I think James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" from 1931 is the perfect example of that. It does baffle me that people complain that this particular movie had very little to do with original Mary Shelly novel, because the original book is one of the darkest, most jaw dropping story ever written. Besides, they made a more accurate version in the 90s, and look how that turned out. Anyway, back to the movie. From beginning to end, this movie is just fun. The opening with the guy coming out and warning the audience that this movie might be too scary for some people, that just sets the tone for what you're about to watch. Every scene in this movie is just classic. There's Dr. Frankenstein and Fritz digging up bodies in the graveyard, the laboratory scenes, the little girl by the pond, the angry villagers, and so on. As a kid, I saw most of these scenes for the first time parodied in Saturday morning cartoons; and it's really cool seeing where it all began. Even if you think this movie sucks for being unfaithful to the book, this is the classic ""Frankenstein"". This is what people think about when they hear the title. Sure, there can be other versions, but they'll never be as iconic as this one. When you hear ""Frankenstein's monster"", do you think of Boris Karloff or Robert De Niro? Obviously you think of the classic, with the Jack Pierce make-up. To me, there will never be a Frankenstein to match this one. It's just so classic, so creepy, so entertaining, that it's impossible not to enjoy. Who cares if it doesn't do the book justice? The movie was made, and it has become so iconic that people are starting to accept it as the classic it is. P.S. This applies to the first three ""Frankenstein"" movies by universal. To me, ""Frankenstein"", ""Bride of Frankenstein"", and ""Son of Frankenstein"" are all equally good, so the sequels should definitely not be overlooked. ""Frankenstein"" is the most classic, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" has the most heart to it, and ""Son of Frankenstein"" is the creepiest. They're all great movies, with some underrated performances, so don't miss them if you're a fan of classic monster movies. They're movies that bring out the mad scientist in all of us.

This was before they had rules set on the things they could show or do. I feel like todays scary movies are a lot scarier because back then they were not really that inappropriate and now today they will show bodies torn up and murdered or something happening to someone.

Frankenstein did remind me of Herman Munster at first, but then I got past it. The acting in the movie was good, but the best acting job came from Boris Karloff for having to act part human and part monster. Though there was a lot of special affects and special lighting to make the movie much more scarier, it didn't appear as scary to people today compared to people who watch it in the 1930s. Since most of today's horror movies have superior special affects, this movie comes off as dated and unrealistic.When watching the movie, I felt sad for the monster. The monster reminded me of Lenny from Of Mice and Men. Lenny being so big he didn't realize he was hurting anyone until it was too late. I think the monster was the same way. If people were nice to him, he would be nice back, and he knew when he did something wrong.

It was the first film of many of its kind, used as a sort of template. James Whale (the director) creates an amazing atmosphere that grabs your attention using detailed sets and spooky effects. Although a categorized as a scary movie the protagonist or ""killer"" in the movie (Frankenstein) is quite mild in the sense that you never really see him kill. that could be due to the code era in which it was shot during. Frankenstein is a creation of the doctor and from his rebirth to his death is misunderstood by everyone. He is seen as a monster yet has the mentality of a child, unfamiliar with the world around him. Not ever being given the chance to be seen as an equal, Frankenstein revolts by killing which ends up leading to his destruction. I enjoyed watching this 1931 classic.

The eerie lighting and set in the scene where Frankenstein and his assistant are digging up the body was very well done, it set the mood for the film with no delay. I was satisfied by the depth of the story. When the monster encounters the little girl by the water, there is a short time where he appears to fit in and not be a threat, then by his own ignorance takes the girl's life. This is symbolic of him wanting to belong even though it is proving impossible. Also, I would like to know what would have happened if the brain that was stolen in the beginning actually was of a normal person and not a murderer. In the ending, I think it is great how the scene of the burning windmill was shot on an actual burning set. It must have been difficult for the actors to concentrate.",Frankenstein

Colin Clives performance as the mad scientist, Dr. Frankenstien, is eccentric and believable without being over the top. Boris Karloff serves as a perfect monster; his slow lumbering steps and his tall stature make him seem inhuman as if he were really created in a laboratory. The sound is beautifully done with hollow, monotone sounds that echo through the abandon castle. The birth scene is particularly well done; the aesthetics of the lab equipment with the Tesla coils as well as the rain and the flashes of lightning come together to make a magnificent scene.

Some scenes within the movie seemed out of place and didn't fit into the ""horror"" aspect of the movie. When people are just sitting around in living rooms talking etc, it kind of took away from what the movie was actually about. I did find that the lighting in the movie was interesting. How they used lighting to reveal Frankenstein made you feel the horror movie effect. I lighting and sound effects of the lightning and storms was interesting. I was confused because I still didn't get if the individual that invented Frankenstein if he was aware that he used an abnormal brain or not. The one part of the movie that caught my feelings was when Frankenstein was with the little girl by the water. The little girl was throwing the flowers in the water and when Frankenstein threw the little girl in the water, you felt that he didn't think it was wrong because he was just mimicking the behavior of the little girl. When the father was carrying the daughter through the village and the village people where stopping their celebrations in horror of the dead child, it made me feel the hurt the father was experiencing. The way the camera followed the father as he was walking put you in the situation with him and made you feel his pain. Over all it was an okay movie for me.

It started off with a spooky vibe right away when the main character Henry Frankenstein and his assistance Fritz were hiding in the graveyard waiting for everyone to leave so they could go and dig up the dead body so they could take parts from it to put together and build their own person in their laboratory. Their laboratory was very freaky and it was even pouring and there was lightening the night that his creation finally came to life with contributed to the scariness of the moment. However, Frankenstein's fiancé worried about him and his sanity so she brought her friend and Frankenstein's old professor to his laboratory to try and help him and see what was going on. They came the night Frankenstein's creation came to life and saw what he was working on for all that time. The monster was very freaky looking with a scar on his face, a nail in his head, and he was very tall with huge feet. The monster's hand moved and he was alive! They thought he was innocent in the beginning but they soon found out he wasn't when he strangled Fritz because he was scaring the monster with a torch. They kept the monster locked up and Frankenstein and his professor decided that it was best that they killed the monster because he was too dangerous. They put a needle into the monster with some kind of drug in it and the monster collapsed. They thought it was dead so Frankenstein returned home to his normal life and prepared for his wedding while his professor stayed at the laboratory to make sure the monster was actually dead. The monster ended up coming back to life and killed the professor! The monster then headed to town but along the way he killed a little girl by throwing her in the water and she drowned. When Frankenstein finally heard that the professor was dead it was too late, the monster was already in his house and hurt his fiancé. The monster then ran away and when Frankenstein found out that he killed the little girl too, the whole town decided they had to find the monster and kill him once and for all. They split into groups and went out to kill the monster. Frankenstein eventually found the monster in the mountains and the monster took him and climbed to the top of a windmill where he threw Frankenstein off the edge.

But sadly it wasn't what I thought it would be. I found the story to be a bit boring and the development Dr. Frankenstein to be flawed, which made it hard for me to really get into the film and its story. In the beginning, Dr. Frankenstein cared only about bringing life back to a dead body. He didn't care much for his fiancé or what people thought of him. But when his monster came to life and wasn't what he expected, the doctor completely forgot about it and went back to his fiancé, now only caring about her. He's starts off only caring about his project and being completely passionate about it, to completely losing interest in it and redirecting that passion right to his fiancé, not to mention in such a short period of time. He doesn't even seem to care about fixing the problem that he had created; he just let the monster run free. Another part of the film that I wasn't too fond of was the ending because I didn't think it had much of a resolution. No one held the doctor responsible, they were just happy that the monster ended up dead. After that they made it seem as if everything was just going to go back to normal. But I do have to say that I found the filming of the movie to be very good. I really enjoyed the use of high and low angled shots, and the various close up shots of the actors who were speaking. Along with that I really enjoyed the continuous shots that were used during some of the city scenes.

The Gothic set design is very imaginative, helped by the beautiful cinematography with suitably bizarre camera angles, and the music score is haunting, melancholy and atmospheric. The locations, all made to order on Universal's sprawling back lot, are utterly believable and realistic, and basing most of the film in tucked-away parts of ancient European country sides benefits the graceful aging of the film, since there are many parts of the world that still look just like the settings we see here. This film paved the way for how horror films should be portrayed. Certain elements such as special effects are certainly mandatory when trying to create the feel and visuals of doom and gloom.",Frankenstein
255,c-fronk,Frankenstein,8,3 February 2016,"As with any book to film adaptation, Frankenstein did not follow the formula of Mary Shelley's novel exactly, but having read the book the film held a similar pattern to the events of the novel. Although nothing really came as a surprise the movie itself was very enjoyable. Boris Karloff's performance was the highlight of the film. His character had the least amount of dialogue, but his physical execution was outstanding. He really conveyed the monstrous look, but also managed to intertwine it with very human actions. The monster is truly a character to sympathize with, disregarding some of his less glamorous deeds. The lighting added a lot to the story as well, making the grittier moments more intense and the lighthearted moments brighter. A great horror film overall.",Frankenstein
256,j-goslin,Very Well Done,9,9 March 2016,"This film is one that I would describe as being a very well done movie for the time period and being shot in black and white. Despite these limitations, the production crew did a fantastic job of using lighting and other special effects to draw attention to what they wanted the viewers to see and create an environment that made the film that much more scary. I applaud all of the actors and actresses in this film as I feel they all did a fantastic job in their role especially Boris Karloff who played the monster. He made the monster seem so realistic and truly terrified the audience while doing it. I thought the choice to cast Colin Clive as Frankenstein was not the best as he seemed to be bored or unenergetic at times during the film which really took away from the excitement of the film.",Frankenstein
257,utslitt,Worthy of Praise,10,22 July 2019,"Everything about this film had me invested from beginning to end. The sets, scenery, acting, story, The Monster, all handled so beautifully. While The Monster isn't as the book depicts him, he's played in a more sympathetic mannerism by Karloff, winds up being tragically misunderstood in the story, as well as the true star of the film blowing every other actor's attempt at shining brighter out of the water. Absolutely the best of out of the Universal Classics by a long shot; if you haven't seen Whale's ""Frankenstein"", then you need to rectify that situation as soon as possible. This will forever be a movie I return to when in need of comfort.",Frankenstein
258,devon2468,a classic horror film,8,27 September 2020,"Frankenstein was a very interesting watch for me. the film really relied heavily on lighting for a lot of its effects. I feel like a Frankenstein in good bright lighting would have just been ugly and creepy, as opposed to what we got, a Frankenstein using the creepy and ""scary"" lighting to its advantage to use the absence of speech to make the whole aura around him to become scary naturally.",Frankenstein
259,ctladybird,Young Frankenstien is way better,5,19 February 2014,"When I first read the comment ""Young Frankenstein is incredibly close to the original"" I did not really want to believe it at first. I was of course proved wrong in watching this film. Honestly compared to the others I have watched for my history of American Film class, this one is the most lack-luster. While I can believe that this movie set the stage (with other films of course) for more horror films, it also does not do anything to push the boundaries of filming itself, and the spots where the story is ""streamlined"" to make way for the monster itself, it leave the film with not a lot of time to really feel for any of the other characters. Which I suppose is what works for it: It's concise, get to the monster stuff. The most memorable part for me was when the monster throws the small girl into the water to help her ""grow"" as she was doing with the flowers. It reminds us that the monster is far more simple than we think, given point A ""Flowers help pretty things grow"" point B just makes sense! In all I can see why this film has withstood the test of time, it was one of the first of a genre and Boris Karloff makes it.",Frankenstein
260,b-kelly13,A horror story with a sad side,9,6 October 2010,"""It's Alive!"" a powerful line of the movie, when you realize Dr, Frankenstein's obsession of creating a man has become a reality. This movie contains an eerie feeling with all the dark lighting, the laboratory in the mountain, the rain, and the lightning. All these effects add to the mood of the film. A powerful scene when the human is raised into the sky and struck by lightning to become ""the Monster."" This movie was meant to fear the monster, but in a way you feel sorry for him. By being given the murder's brain, he became a person he was not supposed to be. And because he was created, not raised, he does not understand certain things, such as when he through the girl in the water, because they were throwing the flowers into the water. The monster was always scared of fire, and Dr. Frankenstein's assistant would constantly scare him with it and make him mad. This makes for an ironic ending when the Monster dies because of fire. The theme of the story in my opinion is to not mess with fate. People should not be created through science.",Frankenstein
261,d-jacobs1,A brilliantly humanitarian monster movie,8,11 October 2010,"More of a philosophical question than a horror film in my eyes, this film beautifully weaves suspense and intrigue with creepy darkness. The film is constantly setting the perfect visual mood for all of it's situations, like Dr. Frankensteins hermit like madness, or the monsters raw ignorance and aggression. I felt the greatest depth of character came surprisingly from the monster, who had no speaking lines. Karloff brilliantly plays the monster with a confusing and tragic sense of humanity. I felt the scene where the monster is first introduced to light to be very metaphoric. After being kept in complete darkness and knowing nothing else he is teased with light and desperately wants it back, but he is denied and is exposed to fire. This theme holds true for the monster throughout the film, he is constantly subject to abuses and misunderstanding and is then punished after the obvious ill consequence.",Frankenstein
262,k-plekan,The Original Classic,8,6 October 2010,"This movie is one of the classics and a must see. The acting was very convincing, as if the main character had truly gone mad which makes sense because you have to be crazy to do the things that he did! The sound effects were very well done. The thunder and lightning roaring in one of the scenes, had a distant sound as the scene itself was shot inside a castle. It did not overpower the voices of the characters. The camera angles scanned the entire scene which made you feel like you were actually scanning the landscape and people around you to your left and to your right.The lighting, even though it was only in black and white, the night scenes were darker and the daylight scenes were very bright.Overall the movie kept your attention and your feelings were mixed about who you actually sided with.A classic that will always be a classic because of its simple but universal plot.",Frankenstein
263,JoshuaC96,Frankenstein,7,6 October 2010,"I thought that Frankenstein was a really good film. I can't say I thought is was particularly frightening, although I can see why it would have been when it first came out. It is, however, a really interesting movie. The very first scene peaks your curiosity, and the movie only gets more interesting from there. Everything on screen really comes together to create a creepy, ominous atmosphere. Such as the decor in Frankenstein's house and in other scenes; and the turbulent weather and dark lighting. The choice of actors for the film was perfect. I thought that Colin Clive had a really edgy face and sharp voice, which made him perfect for a twisted, obsessed scientist. Boris Karloff was also a perfect choice. I thought Karloff had a really intense looking face and eyes, and his portrayal of a witless beast was spot on.",Frankenstein
264,alexv1208,Review of Frankenstein 1931,9,18 October 2010,"Frankenstein is a classic horror film. It's really part of the basis/beginning of present day horror films. This 1931 films portrays a very Gothic feel and setting. The following images help to depict this Gothic feel; dark film, stormy nights (rain, thunder, and lightening), dead bodies covered by sheets, and brains in jars. Images like this give the viewer a psychological experience, and feeling that they're in a scary environment. Frankentein's house is a great example of this, its secluded, made entirely of stone, it seems very dark and cold, and much like a dungeon. When Frankenstein's monster comes to life, Frankenstein yells ""It's alive, it's alive... I know what it feels like to be God."" This was a very controversial quote, surfacing a moral story to the movie; is it right to do what God should be doing? It seems that the story was more depressing and pathetic than scary, you almost felt bad for the monster, because he was never able to fit in to society.In terms of the camera work for the film, I thought it was quite good. The camera angles exaggerated the plot, especially as the camera followed the man through town while carrying his dead daughter. You could see the whole towns reaction, and hear church bells in the background, giving the scene a very real and emotional feeling, something the viewer could relate to.",Frankenstein
265,ben_jm89,Review for History of Cinema,7,7 April 2011,"This was the first time i have seen ""Frankenstein"" and i thought it was pretty good. I really enjoyed the character of Dr Frankenstein. I thought Colin Clive was absolutely great. I never once felt that he was just acting out a role. When he became totally obsessed and crazy over his work you could really feel it. Of course Boris Karloff as the monster Frankenstein was great as well, but i feel that anyone with decent acting could have played a monster. I do not feel this way about Dracula though, because there is a lot more going on facially with his character.The sets, cinematography, and lighting were all superb. I especially like the castle, it was perfectly spooky and dimly lit for the birth of Frankenstein.",Frankenstein
266,danburyn,Not a great classic movie,5,22 February 2012,"This was not one of my favorite movies that I recently watched. Frankenstein was nothing like the book but I know they filmed the movie more off the play. During the movie, in many spots it would go to fast or to slow. It was almost like they couldn't keep the speed consistent because they were trying to go with the film. Films should stay at one pace, if you want it to be slow and have action it is fine. I feel they just couldn't get it right. Also the camera angles were not as spectacular as some other movies made within this time frame. I think what really hurt this film was it had to much going on, one minute Dr, Frankenstein is create the monster and next thing you know he is getting married. Overall I do have some respect for this movie because it was one of the first monster movies made and the later movies really fixed that.",Frankenstein
267,NineFelines,Fantastic Early Monster Flick,8,21 February 2012,"While I cannot honestly say this was the best movie ever, there were several very impressive and powerful scenes which catapult it to the upper strata of early movie art. It is especially unfortunate that the scene with Maria by the water was censored for 50 plus years. Without that scene I don't think the same emotions would have been engendered for the monster that were when he seems to realize what he had done.The atmosphere created for the movie was excellent from the opening scene – very rich and enveloping and mostly believable. The lack of a musical score was not noticeable due to the extensive use of ambient (diegetic) sound. There was a couple of scenes with some fairly well executed smooth camera movement – notable the scene where the father is carrying Maria through town and when Elizabeth walked from room to room in her wedding gown.",Frankenstein
268,d-burgess3,Pretty OK,3,20 February 2012,"For most people Frankenstein was a Classic horror movie and still is, but for me it was a plain movie which lacked lots of good thrill in my opinion. To someone else they may say, for a 20s horror flick everything was executed just fine, as for me and growing up in a different era it lacked everything that makes a horror movie in my understanding. A horror movie to me is more intense, more off screen gut twisting scenes. I felt because Frankenstein didn't have the qualities of a Jason movie or a van helsing movie it didn't reach my interest. Now, if I had to think of a part that was interesting it will be when the man walked down the street with his lifeless daughter in his hand. That part there was interesting because you felt for the guy, other than that everything else could have put me to sleep.",Frankenstein
269,foxhunter25,Frankenstein (1931),7,3 October 2012,"Well every one knows the story of Frankenstein. A monster that was created with a ""bad brain"" that goes on a rampage. There is some great cinematic photography shots in this film, which helped make it seem, at the time (in 1931), almost scary. This is especially so in the scene where the monster has just hung Fritzs by his own whip. If this movie could have been filmed in color I don think it would have helped make the movie any better. I think the black and white film enhances the nightmarish mood the movie is trying to portray. I personally did not enjoy this movie very much. This does not mean that Frankenstein is not a great movie. I give this film a 7 out of 10 mainly because it's not my favorite genre but it is still very entertaining.",Frankenstein
270,stephypoo912,MY Frankenstein Experience?,6,12 February 2013,"Maybe because I am so into comedies and action movies, I wasn't really interested in this movie. This was the first time I've seen the original Frankenstein and I was somewhat impressed, but at the same time, bored! I liked the story-line, however. And the fact that it was a classic, and my knowledge about the history of cinema, helped ease the boredom just by so much. What I did find interesting though was the movie's SOUNDTRACK! Another thing I found really interesting was the movie score and the angle shots of the whole movie. That was highly interesting. Maybe because it was a classic, and released in the 1931, the hype (back then) was greater than it is now. But although it is a classic, now I KNOW Frankenstein is a reference for a lot of the movies I enjoy watching.",Frankenstein
271,Taffyta,Not as enjoyable as I had hoped.,6,8 February 2013,"I was excited to finally be able to watch this movie. I've only ever seen remade scenarios of it in newer movies and TV shows. So I had an idea of what to expect, but I was completely wrong. It was a very different story than what I expected. It wasn't even scary, more like disturbing. At first I found the monster to be unsettling. Then for a brief second, I liked him. I thought that he was charming after all. But then that very quickly changed. I know this is a classic, well-liked movie, so I kind of hate to say that I didn't like it... but I couldn't really get into it. The other part of the story not involving the monster was a little ""bland"". It was inconsistent in places. None of the characters were very likable at all. Mostly they were all annoying. Perhaps I'd like the other old monster movies, but not this one.",Frankenstein

What a great story of a young scientist who collects body parts, to ultimately restore his creation's life. The set director and the production manager did a great job because, the film looked so grimy and dirty which put you in the feel of Frankenstein. In the beginning I was confused about Frankenstein because, I thought maybe he was just curious about things like a new born baby would.I didn't think he was trying to be harmful to people, but at the end my feelings changed like, maybe he did know what he was doing.",Frankenstein

I really like the way the company (Universal Studios) put in a question mark for the role of the monster. It's a good movie that is about Henry Frankenstein and his monster. Even though there is a dark part to this, it's still likable. I really felt a little suspense in my body when I saw this. It was probably because of the monster doing some horrible things to the people in the village, including Elizabeth. The uses for sound and photography chances were really nice, including the castle on the hill with a lot of thunder booming around it. I can't wait to see another movie like this in the future.",Frankenstein
274,gcappadona,Frankenstein 1931 review,9,17 September 2014,"I absolutely love this movie! I think that it was the director's intention for us to feel bad for/ be on the monster's side. Although, he did do terrible things it wasn't necessarily his fault because the Doctor invented this him and ""gave him life"" with a faulty, criminal, and abnormal brain. I do not think we should feel bad for the Doctor because he didn't care about the ramifications to his actions (putting the wrong brain in the monster). When he first found out that the brain that is in the monster once belonged to a criminal, and obviously the makeup of the brain remains the same, the Doctor kind of just blew it off. I LOVED the scene, although it was very sad, when the dad was carrying his daughter throughout the town. The scene shows the town in full enjoyment and contentment; when the camera pans over their faces (with the dad and daughter also in the shot) you see the town's people face's change from cheerful to worried and concerned. The camera angle here made the entire scene absolutely perfect! I personally thought that the end was a little bit overdone. I think that the director could have shown Frankenstein ""dying"" another way that would have affected the audience in a more of an emotional way. I think that this way was more awkward that sad. Overall, this movie was verrrrrrrrrrry good!",Frankenstein
275,shavonnacroley,Frankenstein (1931),7,20 September 2014,"The film starts off with good speed, but as you get more into the story it slows down. This is mostly because of the meeting with some of the characters. They were important because you get all the information you need to understand what's occurring throughout the film but man they dragged on. Which made it sort of a bore for me.It was interesting because you're thrown right into action in the beginning of the film and it makes you want to continue watching it but the middle drags out then you're thrown right back in when Dr. Frankenstein is ready to marry is beloved and a man's daughter is murdered accidentally and the town goes on a massive man hunt. This film seemed kind of tragic for me. I say this because of what the monster has been put through plus his inability to understand what he is doing and what he has done wrong. You feel for him but then again you don't because he has killed other people in the film. It puts you in a interesting position. You can't decide whether to feel sorry for him or to see him burn.It was great to see the use of light. At some of the ""scariest"" moments the scenes are shot in dark but with things are joyous its bright as can be. I also loved how the camera man followed the monster around the woods, it made the scene more thrilling and I was curios to see what would happen next. The acting was great!",Frankenstein
276,leonrach95,It's Alive!,7,23 September 2014,"This movie gives you the real deal of watching the monster in action. Frankenstein really gives you a good sense of what good movies from the 1930's were. I felt like the action of this movie flew by and the actors really gave you a sense of feeling like you could have been standing next to them. The use of lighting and how they zoomed up into the actors faces really gave you a sense of how dramatic things were getting. How they dressed the actors was quite tasteful in my opinion and gave it a good feel for the movie. Overall this movie kept me entertained and gave me a real sense of who the original ""Frankenstein"" and monster really were.",Frankenstein
277,jferraro3,Dr. Frankenstein dreams of one day creating life but did not know what he got himself into,5,21 September 2014,"I thought Frankenstein(1931) was a real staple horror movie. The acting was not the greatest, but it definitely did the job for a movie from the 30's and told the classic story of Frankenstein. For a black and white movie they did a great job with the effects from the lightning in the storm shocking alive the monster or the huge fire in the cabin at the end. The lighting and effects did a great job of helping this movie have a creepy eerie feel. There was a great use of light and dark contrast with the shadows in Dr. Frankenstein's lab to create this effect. This movie is truly a horror classic and one of the first original monster movies. However i felt it could have done a better maybe more elaborate job of explaining the plot. I wanted to see more of the monsters rampage through the town, Blissfully ignorant as it may have been. I wanted more of a build up of the towns peoples rage leading to that great ending. All in all this movie was a trend setter and the one of the first greats of its genre.",Frankenstein
278,MC_Barton,Misunderstood or moral defector?,9,5 February 2015,"Frankenstein in all essence of the word is a masterpiece. Although some may not agree, the true beauty is found in the underlying message of the film and the way the cinematography uncovers said memorandum. The film tackles a really tough topic during the time of 1931, equality, and the misunderstanding orbiting the unknown territory it inhabits. Is the ""monster"" that Dr. Frankenstein spawns truly the definition of the word, a moral defector, or is he a compassionate being that is able to deter from right and wrong and experience emotional sensibilities? Surely one may take what they can from the content surrounding ""the monster,"" or they can extrapolate his true intentions by his interactions with the living the environment in which they coexist.",Frankenstein
279,aladar-219-783287,Frankenstein - My Overall Thoughts,7,10 February 2015,"I, to be honest, was expecting to really like this film but I couldn't find myself getting into it. It had nothing to do with the atmosphere or its ""creepy"", gloomy mood, but mainly with how it was executed. I'm mot sure what put me off about it but it didn't really thrill me at all. Maybe it was because I've already been surrounded by the culture of Frankenstein and was bored by it? I can't really say which came first, but whatever I didn't like in this film had nothing to do with how it is as a movie in general and it's mostly my personal preferences.One thing that I really liked was its similarities to Noir film, with all the darkness and attention to shadow as a means to expression. Things like that are always fun to watch, and despite its campy acting everything seemed well put together.I wasn't too thrilled with Frankenstein, however, because his character just came off as simplistic as it can get. If I had to go for a Frankenstein, it would be the version that Glen Wilder played in Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks, because his interpretation, while humorous, managed to make him intriguing. The original Frankenstein character, of all things, was unlikable. Nothing to do with the actor, mind you, but I could not attach myself to him.I enjoyed the monster, however, because it was portrayed in a light that didn't play him off as completely innocent yet managed to show that he was a thoughtful person with emotions and feelings. I believe their portrayal of this message towards the audience was good, but it could have been better. Maybe I've been spoiled by other films that managed to fill in a broader concept of Frankenstein's monster, but for the first adaption I can see where others grasped it from.I also HATED the ending. Very anti-climatic and unresolved. It felt like the director got sick of working on the film and went on a permanent coffee break. It felt very lazy and I wish they added more to it, or at least show how Frakenstein reacted to this, or even give him some character development upon realizing the implications of what his monster really was capable of.In general, though, I wish I liked this movie more than I do, but I appreciate it for what it is.",Frankenstein
280,hagen2357,Frankenstein Review,7,6 February 2015,"The film ""Frankenstein"" directed by James Whale was significant for a number of reasons. This film was one of the first movies about monsters to be released and was immediately loved by the public. Today, monster movies are popular as ever and earlier movies such as this one really got the ball rolling. The monster is played by Boris Karloff and he did a fantastic job playing his role. Although the monster is unknowledgeable to what he is doing and innocent in a way, he does horrifying things which trigger the people of the town to quickly turn on him. One of the only things I didn't like about the movie in general is the inconsistency in the character of Henry Frankenstein played by Colin Clive. Originally, Frankenstein was a mad scientist who isolated the outside world and was delusional. As the movie progressed, he completely transformed into a family man who seemed to vow to never put his work before his bride. For me personally, I don't typically enjoy when a character changes personalities which are polar opposites. Other than this, I thought this film was great. This movie helped started the popular trend of monster/horror movies and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",Frankenstein
281,m-carter-68742,Magical,9,8 October 2015,"This set the tone for the future of monster movies. This film will always be a classic, even though it has some blemishes. The lighting is immaculate and it sets the mood as dreary throughout the entire film, it is almost one of my favorite aspects of the film. It's story is well done and different from typical monster movies. The monster itself, made from parts of multiple corpses, is still recognized for its awkward motions and scary, deep tone grunts. This was not the norm of the time. the idea is still used today, and references are made to it in many different contexts. The famous line, ""It's alive"" is still heard today, though more used as a joke. Like I said, Frankenstein has made a huge impact on the monster movie world.",Frankenstein
282,ninabruzdzinski,I loved this movie,9,3 February 2016,"Frankenstein is one of my all time favorite classics. I love the aspect of the monster being within each and every one of us; we just have to find something we're passion enough about to drive us to that madness. Dr. Frankenstein was a very driven man and became so obsessed with his work he stopped at nothing to achieve his goal. Although he did not handle this situation in the best way he could have, it was still a great film. He did in a way abandon his fiancé and became so immersed in his work that nothing else mattered. But creating his monster mattered to him, and I think he needed to do that for himself in order to move on with his life. Had he let his fiancé or father pull him away from his dream, he would have forever resent them. In my eyes, the monster was not really a monster. He had a child-like innocence about him, and simply didn't know better in some instances. I also absolutely love how ambiguous the ending of this film is, it adds such suspense, and also a bit of hope that the ""monster"" is not really gone.",Frankenstein
283,k-ellinger,Real Monsters,9,9 February 2016,"Frankenstein is all about a creation of a monster and how destructive he becomes. A doctor takes the remains of a corpse and is able to bring him back to life. Even though the doctor is successful in bringing him back to life, he isn't too successful in how to make the creature into a properly functioning human being. The audience can't help but feel horrified and bad for the creature at the same time. We feel horrified at what destruction he's done but we also feel bad because he doesn't know any better. He also didn't ask to be brought back to life and to be part of this science experiment. In the end, we ask, who is the real monster, the doctor who brought him back to life, or Frankenstein himself?",Frankenstein
284,CriticalViewing,"Frankenstein, the misunderstood ""monster""",8,14 March 2016,"Everyone today knows about the monster known as Frankenstein. But even without prior knowledge, the director, James Whale, does a magnificent job of expressing the plot line. Through use of beautiful photography, and framing shots and scenes in just the right lighting, makes this a very powerful film. The audience can understand how the people of the town feel like, and how they themselves feel. If they think the Monter's existence was a mistake or if they empathize with him. Because in a way, Frankenstein/The Monster and/or the townspeople have all been us at some point and time in our lives. There was a time for each of us where we had thoughts or did something we felt was the right thing to do or that our idea or action would be accepted in it's context, only to be met with backlash because our theories were misled due to a lack of information. Because we didn't know any better. Or simply those around us were unable to see the world from our perspective. And we have all been the townspeople, by saying that something was dead wrong and standing by that at least once in our lives. Whale catches that aspect and allows us to feel both perspectives through the use of an omniscient camera narrator. There is a scene in the film, without giving a spoiler, where the Monster does an action out of self defense. And through the framing of this shot, the Monster is clearly the victim. But when he acts, only a scream is heard and the result of his self defensive action is seen. And due to his inability to communicate, it is seen as gross and that he is a ""monster"". The way this film is shot does a very good job of allowing the viewer to easily take both sides and both sets of facts (omniscient fact vs. observed fact) , and comprehend both the explicit and implicit meanings with ease.",Frankenstein
285,zwrite2,Much better as science fiction than horror,7,21 November 2007,"Let me get this out of the way. The most enjoyable part of ""Frankenstein"" was when The Monster killed Edward Van Sloan's character. In all his movies (""Dracula,"" ""The Mummy""), he plays a smug, all-knowing, plot-killer. ""Frankenstein"" would have been better without him. There, I said it.In all seriousness, I found the first half of the movie inventive, intriguing, mysterious, foreboding, suspenseful, and provocative. It worked as a science fiction movie. As a citizen, I would never approve of a Dr. Frankenstein conducting bizarre experiments on humans. As a movie viewer, I was gung-ho in support of the Colin Clive character being an anti-establishment renegade.In addition, watching The Monster adjust to life as a newborn was very interesting. He was very gentle, obeying his creator's commands like a puppy while walking harmlessly around the laboratory. Later, he fearfully reacts to his first sight of light while Dr. F. seeks to comfort him.I looked forward to 40 more minutes of watching the world from The Monster's perspective. (OK, I knew what was going to happen, but I try to block my knowledge so my review is fairer.) Unfortunately, the Van Sloan character, Dr. Waldman, stepped in and stuck a dagger into the story.The turning point of the movie was when Frankenstein's assistant scared The Monster by holding a torch a few feet from his head. Of course, he reacted negatively and throws a temper tantrum. Dr. Waldman urges Dr. F to ""shoot it"" and the creator makes the boneheaded decision of tying up The Monster and giving up on his experiment after one negative experience.This turnaround ruined the movie  and makes no sense. Instantaneously, Frankenstein changes from a bold, imaginative rulebreaker into his mentor's sycophant and a conformist. His goal changes from creating life to getting married. This plot turn can't be more unoriginal. Boooring!!!!A large part of the second half of the movie is set in a castle where Dr. F's father has six, count them six, servants. I couldn't be less interested in Dr. F's private life. And somehow villagers who are determined to rid the world of The Monster become worshipers of the very scientist who created that Monster and anoint him as the leader of the anti-Monster group. Stuuupid!!!The story would have been far more interesting if Frankenstein told Waldman to shove it and the movie becomes a confrontation between Frankenstein and The Monster on the one side and the staid establishment on the other. The audience should have been rooting for Dr. F and The Monster.Given the story's turn, The Monster should have been much scarier. He kills two people who were trying to harm him and innocently and accidentally kills a little girl. In other words, the movie doesn't work as a horror story after having succeeded splendidly as science fiction until the plot turn.The plot turn also directs attention away from The Monster and toward the now boring doctor. This is devastating because the best post-turn scenes focus on The Monster trying to learn about life.Halfway through the movie, I was considering making it my first 10. Unfortunately, the transition from science fiction to predictable romance/weak horror compels me to award it a 7.ZWrite",Frankenstein
286,alooftrashman,"Scared? Probably Not, But I Feel Warm and Fuzzy",10,11 March 2010,"Everyone who is anyone who knows about movies knows about Frankenstein. Everyone knows the plot. Every frame of this movie has been analyzed and dissected and committed to many a film buff's memory. The interesting thing, though, is that nearly 80 years later it's still as visceral and deep as it ever was.Using a mix of pre-built sets (to give it that moody vibe) and on location shooting that really captures the essence of birth and wonder, we watch a man in Dr. Frankenstein care for his tragically misunderstood monster in a somewhat strict way. Boris Karloff plays the monster with much aplomb, at first barely self-aware but constantly learning.There's almost too many themes to count in this classic, ranging from the human effect on personal development to a man understanding his place (or lack thereof, and then later understanding his actual place) - to the misanthrope nature of building a person out of spare body parts (read: don't do it!). Great movie, could only be better if John Lithgow played Dr. Frankenstein. (Harry and the Hendersons, anyone?)",Frankenstein
287,RecceR,It's Alive!,8,30 October 2012,"A scientist set on reanimating the dead assembles a body out of various human parts and gives the creature new life. Doctor Henry Frankenstein must face the consequences once his experiment takes a turn for the worse. Frankenstein stands the test of time and will always remain a classic. Boris Karloff portrays the reanimated monster and while he does not have any actual lines, his performance was very eerie, almost animalistic. Colin Clive also gives a great performance as Dr. Frankenstein himself; I still get chills when he goes nearly mad exclaiming ""it's alive!"" Though the movie does alter the story written by Mary Shelley, it encompasses the same notion that man is always trying to play God, which does not always go right. The overall movie is enjoyable and is something any classic horror fan will enjoy and appreciate.",Frankenstein

Watching the film gave me chills, made me feel dark, lonesome, and a bit zany. The lighting in a lot of the laboratory scenes gave you a true sense of doom and gloom. The wooden floors and the sound they projected, the chains, the thunder and lightning, all added elements of spook there are now considered to be classic. Didn't care for the plot. interesting to know that Frankenstein is actually the wacky scientist, and NOT the monster. I think that this film paved the way for how horror films should be portrayed. Certain elements such as special effects are certainly mandatory when trying to create the feel and visuals of doom and gloom.",Frankenstein

It is cliché, now, but here it is genius, legendary, a vision.There is more here than just the monster, though that alone would make this movie worth a watch so many years later. Colin Clive is also strong as Frankenstein, and who can forget the moment as the monster comes to life.A movie of 70 minutes, perpetually rewatchable, legendary in so many ways.

290,kendraocon,Great movie!,8,4 October 2012,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I think the lighting effects and even the technical effects caught me off guard and allowed me to get sucked in. The lighting techniques that the director used were great, they weren't all the same and they allowed the viewers to give a better understanding of what we were suppose to be feeling. I think that the lighting with Frankenstein in the cellar was very bright on his face and really black background, using low key lighting. The low key lighting added to the emotions and the feelings, it shows Frankenstein as this creepy and scary man. The compositions of the scenes were also great, it showed a lot, but it wasn't were it was too much for the viewer. The settings add to the genre of the movie, that creepy and scary type of feeling. Such as the beginning scene where they're at the cementary at a very late time of night, showing black skys and brightened tombstones. As the men are walking with the fire on sticks in their hands the perspective and angle is switched from more of a wide angle shot showing all of the people to just showing one particular person. They try not to get caught up in one angle or perspective, switching up the scenes by showing lower angles or more complex angles. The scene where Frankenstein is peaking in on the little girl playing, showing him as he is like an Innocent child which is the the complete opposite way that he was made to look like. If they spent more time working on him then he would have not caused so much trouble, he did not know any better. The camera angle is switched as the man is walking with his dead daughter, it shows him carrying her across town as people stare at her in disbelief and some what of a shock. The camera is in front of them as the scene starts, but then moves to showing each side of them, showing the people he is walking by.",Frankenstein
291,dfiscaletti8,Review for Frankenstein,3,2 October 2012,"James Whale's Frankenstein was not all that impressive. I viewed the movie Frankenstein for the first time the other day and I must say it will be the last time I will be watching any Frankenstein movie. From the beginning with the dark and dreary set to the end with melodramatic music there was no enjoyment while being forced to watch this movie. The story itself just doesn't fascinate me; I find it very stupid (I apologize for the lack of a better word) that a ""mad scientist"" attempts to bring a human back to life and in the process creates a monster. It's very unrealistic causing my attention to be lost. I suppose back in the 1930's this is what interested the audience, but in today's world this does not rank with the current horror films. Despite the terrible story line the movie did display some impressive acting along with some important messages. Boris Karloff did an amazing job playing the monster. I can only imagine how hard his role could have been; he was a very convincing monster and did not lose his character at any point in the film. I do believe the movie's portrayal of the ideas ""man was not to play God"" and ""free will- people will be what they want to be regardless"" was excellent also. James Whale knew how to create a film filled with emotion and significant themes, but I just don't think he applied his skills to the right story.",Frankenstein
292,yilmazomar,EEERraaaraargghhhhh!!!!! OOOaaahhhmmmmpphhhhrrrrggggrrr,9,4 October 2012,"Man Mister Karloff if I saw you in the street casually walking to work I'm sorry to say I wouldn't recognize you no sir not one bit, but if I saw you lumbering through the woods with your hands awkwardly placed in front of you, groaning like you're stuck in traffic or like you just checked the fridge for something to eat and all you found was 2 week old meatloaf, with those screws popping out of the side of your neck I would ask myself what I'm doing in these dense woods on a shadowy stormy night acknowledge the brilliance of the photography around me and then.....well probably run to the nearest village. The settings and backgrounds and special effects were absolutely gorgeous, ominous and believable, just exactly how much character and mystery they put into each shadow and each light, it's stunning what they could do with black and white, the special effects they were capable of producing and how beautifully they did, that burning revolving windmill at the end is a fascinating scene that white fire burning into the blackest night I've seen in a while is wondrous. I have a feeling that it wouldn't be as effective in color. There's something depressing and disturbing and and gloomy about these ancient colors, perhaps it's all become a part of the imagination over time. Boris Karloff has made such a legend out of himself that it's double scary when you first see him step through that door, it's as if it's this great arrival of this man this myth something truly otherworldy, and when he slowly turns to face us there's this evil curl in his lip and drunken look in his eye as if he knows that he will live on forever and he's just there basking in all that glory. The story really is frightening if you think about the monsters (industry, technology, trying to be god, greed) man is capable of and how these monsters can come to destroy us and ruin us and if you think about it it's going on all around us. So beware not all monsters come out of the dark.",Frankenstein
293,LizNaylor,Frankenstein,7,12 February 2013,"Compared to horror films made recently, ""Frankenstein"" may seem sub-par or lacking, yet for a film made in the 1930's, this horror film was very well done. The interesting thing about this film is that there is no music at all during the actual movie, just in the opening sequence. No music means that the actors have to convey their emotions even more than they normally would, because their is no music in the background to really convince viewers of their current emotions. Karloff does a wonderful job as Frankenstein's monster. Although he may not say anything throughout the entirety of the film, the way he composes himself has a viewer both angry with his actions, but at the same time a tad sympathetic, as he is not sure what to do with himself at all times. Frankenstein's monster is certainly an interesting character because he really just needs someone to help him out, instead everyone is afraid of him. All in all, this movie was very well done, although it could have used a musical score to go along with the acting.",Frankenstein
294,v-colarusso,A Sad Monster,8,5 April 2013,"Frankenstein was a very well done film. The makeup was strikingly impressive considering how early on in the cinema industry that the movie was made. The commentary in the very beginning of the film did well to excite the audience for the impending horror and dark philosophical twists. What made Frankenstein unique from other horror movies was that it contained a certain level of pathos. It demands a more cerebral reaction from its audience because it not only deals with a very heavy subject - science creating life - but it somehow procures sympathy from its audience for the tormented monster, despite the tragedy he's created.",Frankenstein
295,westersnows,Frankenstein (1931),6,18 February 2014,"I have seen this film a number of times, and it has never impressed me. Firstly, it's supposed to be a horror film. I am in no way comparing it to recent horror, but I wouldn't say this film is even slightly unsettling. Of course, I understand that it would probably have been shocking at the time it was released, but after reading a few reviews by others, apparently some still find it scary. Or at least creepy. This ties into the fact that I get no real feelings whatsoever from this film. The message deals with the dangers of playing god, and wielding power over life and death. Plus a concept that's more touched upon in the book (since the monster is educated): should the audience feel sorry for the monster, or for Frankenstein? And who is responsible for innocent deaths-- the monster for committing murder, or Frankenstein for creating him? These moral concepts are there for the viewer to empathize with and to become engaged with the characters. Yet, I have never empathized with either Frankenstein or the Monster. Not having any emotional connection to the characters, and therefore no connection to the film's moral questions, this leaves the film rather bland for me.The one aspect that makes it more bearable is the cinematography, especially the lighting. I definitely consider this movie to be very well shot, and just from an artistic perspective there are some incredibly beautiful scenes. Although most of the camera and lighting work contributes to creating a ""dark and stormy night"" vibe, formal qualities alone do not constitute an atmosphere of horror.",Frankenstein
296,john-hogan23,"""I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you.""",6,19 September 2014,"Frankenstein is one of the most lasting and memorable of the six 1930's horror films that put Universal on the map. Even upon seeing the enormous box office success and critical acclaim the film was able to achieve with its release I can't even imagine a single person involved in the production of the film would ever believe that Henry Frankenstein's lumbering monster would become an absolute genre behemoth, still remaining an unmistakable champion of horror to this day, nearing a century later. But Frankenstein earned the right to his remarkable place in history. Very few monsters have ever been and will ever be so creative and unique, and be able to leave such a lasting impression. Everyone knows Frankenstein. There's no denying that. But for me however, the star of the film wasn't Frankenstein's monster. The most mesmerizing and impressive aspect of the film was it's incredible camera-work. Frankenstein had an excellent atmosphere, that's undeniable, it's what made the film shine, and this was all due to an impeccably fluid camera. The camera swooped across the sets, showing off and boasting about its wonderfully spooky environments. Whenever the film would take you to a new place it made sure it gave the viewer an opportunity to take everything in, and when you have a set as unforgettable as Frankenstein's laboratory or a location as genuine as the village that would fall victim to perils brought on by Frankenstein's monster, it's just so important that you show it off, and the film never failed to do so.Despite all of the praise Frankenstein has earned, like everything else it is not without it's flaws. It has become fairly dated over the years, which is to be expected, but that doesn't help the fact that it's so darn noticeable. Also while the film is so excellent at showing off its sets, it has a tendency to get right in the face of the characters during any dialog. This does work at first to give a sense of the character's expression and the emotions they're trying to convey, but oh man does it get irritating after it flips from person to person the umpteenth time in any given conversation. And perhaps most importantly, this film's monster is just so vastly inferior to Mary Shelly's original creation. While hers was emotionally complex and much more pitiable in the novel, the film's Frankenstein monster has a certain moral ambiguity that makes it just as easy to give up on and dislike him as it is to pity and feel for him. He does much more evil than good, and it seems like his default reaction to a person is to try and strangle them. Sure he has his genuine moments of compassion that work to portray him as a misunderstood creature, but as the film neared it's end I found it too hard to stay on his side. There were numerous instances where he was intentionally violent. Sure he showed he had a tenderness when the little girl gave him some of her flowers, and the film was successful in communicating that his drowning her was completely due to his naivety, but that was the only instance that, for me, was able to convey a positive side to the monster.In the end, Frankenstein is a classic and worthy of anyone's viewership, but it doesn't have what it takes to triumph over its old age like so many other films from Hollywood's infancy. Still, I can't help but have a deep respect for a monster that makes me wonder if it will last either decades or even another century to come. I'll say it again, everyone knows Frankenstein.",Frankenstein
297,m-meehan-28239,Frankenstein,4,2 March 2016,I believe that horror movies are the most difficult to stay scary as time passes. I can understand that at the time this may have been scary because there was nothing like it but it was hard to bring myself into this movie because fear in these old movies seems so fake. I appreciate the idea of Frankenstein and how iconic it is. When it comes to the execution of it in 1931 I cannot find it entertaining. This being said there was good use of stretching a low budget by using low lighting and keeping the audience focused on what the cameraman and director wanted to see. The most invested I was in this movie was when you see the monsters interaction with the little girl. This scene is necessary since it lets you see the innocence of the monster and how he is childlike and misunderstood.,Frankenstein
298,marshrydrob,"Science can take, or give life.....",9,5 October 2017,"1931 Frankenstein..... I am a big fan of universal and hammer horror. When it comes to monsters, the Wolf Man and Dracula; they will always be my favorites. When it comes to film, Frankenstein; is at the top of the list. The film called on a great selection of talent. Boris Karloff, did a miraculous job playing the monster; the man's acting talent knows no bounds.The story, by Mary Shelley; was a good tale, that actually opened cross over opportunities with future classic horror ideas. Pitting the Wolf Man against Frankenstein, and Dracula; with many of the favored horror actors reprising their original roles.Classic horror films like Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolf Man; gave us a template, for the creation of future masterpieces of horror; that many directors and producers of modern horror look on to this day.1931 Frankenstein, is on of the best films of its time, and it will be enjoyed for many more years to follow.",Frankenstein

The fact that it was made fairly early in the ""talkie"" era does come through with rather stilted dialog and, unfortunately, no music score to help heighten the suspense. Mary Shelly's book, ""Frankenstein"" was, IMHO very boring. I personally would not have been interested in seeing a movie that faithfully followed this book. Boris Karloff is excellent as the monster but I tend to get weary of Colin Clive's whining and overacting. Gunner",Frankenstein
300,mikemckiernan,Karloff is King!,7,1 November 2021,"I enjoyed it MUCH more than Dracula - only comparing for obvious reasons, not that the two movies are similar.It's all about Boris Karloff's performance. He's phenomenal. If it were released today, he would receive an Oscar nom. He, Colin Clive and Dwight Frye (Fritz) are the only ones who can act. Everyone else's performance is Amateur Hour, early-talkies crap (especially Frederick Kerr as Dr. Frankenstein's father). The screenplay is also crap, although the monster's story was surprisingly intriguing. That is, until he randomly attacked Elizabeth. From his creation up until that point, I was enthralled with how tragic his story was. After the monster's interaction with the little girl (which is the best part of the film, IMO), it just takes a left turn with too many questions as to what the monster's agenda is. SPOILER: And the ending is terrible - Dr. Frankenstein should not (and would not) have survived that fall. It should have ended with the windmill burning. Oh well. It was 1931.

But by any modern standards, this movie is simply unbearable!I am not complaining about the movie's not being faithful to the book at all. But aside from the points mentioned above, this movie 'sucks' in every respect - as a previous reviewer has so eloquently put it. The (over-)acting is ridiculous. Even Karloff's grunting, stumbling around, and waving his hands around theatrically is pathetic. The script is terrible (what script?). The plot is thin and predictable. The dialog is highly artificial and annoying. Some of the sets are pitiful (skies with wrinkles are really 'interesting').How can anybody with a 'normal' brain call this cheesy B-movie a 'masterpiece'?",Frankenstein
302,kristenwthomas,Classic horror with a long legacy,8,19 September 2020,"The set design in ""Frankenstein"" really made the film more immersive and make a great contribution to the mood and story. The graveyard, for example, is dramatically lit, with crosses at different angles to make the composition more interesting. There is also a statue of Jesus juxtaposed with a statue of death which foreshadows how Dr. Frankenstein blurs the lines between life and death, and ""plays god"".
His lab is also created in a dynamic way, and lighting is used to create dramatic shadows that add to the mood. The set of the lab also feels cramped and claustrophobic, which creates more tension. Windows and doors are also kind of prison/dungeon like, making the space feel more ominous.
Lighting and set design elevate this film and make it more iconic and memorable. Paired with how dynamic Boris Karloff's performance was, the film brought Mary Shelley's vision to life, and has had a lasting impact on the horror genre.",Frankenstein
303,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,A Wonderful Classic Horror Film,10,22 September 2020,"Colin Clive gave an amazing performance as Henry Frankenstein. He was perfectly over-the-top and manic as the mad scientist. You can see his ego and narcissism when the character brings The Monster (the legendary Boris Karloff) to life and he exuberantly exclaims ""It's ALIVE!"" Clive became the character here. The character of Henry moved from insanity to regret tinged with panic by the end of the film all courtesy to Clive's skill. This talented actor was gone far too soon at the age of 37.Unlike most horror films of the time, Henry appears to have a specific scientific discipline in which he was trained prior to going over the edge and slapping together cadavers for giggles. Often the central troublemaker was called a ""scientist"" or given the title of ""doctor,"" but a specific discipline was never hinted at. They appear to have just decided to science one day and create mayhem. Oops! Here Henry is a trained physician.And then there was Boris Karloff. Karloff the Great! Karloff the Magnificent! The one and only Boris Karloff. There was no one like him before and there has been no one like him since. He turned in a star making performance with a script that contained only grunts and groans for him. How does that even happen? But it did. He had worked in theater and film prior to this but Frankenstein is what made this actor a household name.The Monster (as it was called in the credits) was sympathetic and more than just a lumbering creature as people tend to think of it. You could empathize with it and even see it confused by the world in which it found itself. Everything was new and this simple-minded thing with inhuman strength did not know what to do. Its ignorance coupled with its brute strength and simple mind was a recipe for disaster. This was all owed to not only the direction of Whale but the performance of the talented Karloff.The makeup is iconic to this day. We have the raised head with the flat cranium and drooping eyes and the well-known bolts in the neck. This was all topped off with the thick soled shoes that made the 5'11"" Karloff menacingly tall. Jack Pierce was known as difficult but the man was a genius in his time.This film is filled with memorable moments. One of the best known involves the young girl playing with flowers Little Maria (Marilyn Harris). Still shocking by modern standards and horrifying by the standards of the day, we watch as the simple creature who is finally experiencing kindness from the girl misinterprets things and ends up accidentally drowning her. This tragic moment was cut for the longest time from prints of the film and thought lost until it was rediscovered in the 80s and finally restored to the picture.This 1931 classic from Universal Pictures is an amazing film. A true horror classic. This movie had a definite visual style. The lighting and the designs were such that they were to create a mood and a feeling. Look at the castle and the old windmill for example. Do they make structural sense? Do they look real or do they look more like stylized pieces of art? These designs were definitely influenced by German expressionist film of the time.Some of the techniques used in filming and some of the choices made by Whale and crew may not pop with modern audiences but look at the number of films made in the five years before or after this film and you will see much of the same things done in the ones that are considered classics. This movie took those and tossed in horror and came of with something amazing and original that is still talked about to this day.Like so many other movies at the time, Frankenstein was based on a play. Here it was a 1927 play by Peggy Webling and as such it was a broad adaption of the classic Mary Shelley book. It definitely had a much softer ending than the original story upon which it is based. You will get the idea of the book in broad strokes but not in specifics. I gripe about this often in modern films because what happens is you get something weaker that is trying to ride the coattails of something superior. I guess they knew what they were doing back then because what we have is something that is just as good and strong in its own right as the inspiration. Not quite like the original. Less a sibling and more a cousin.The unfortunate thing about Frankenstein is so much of what they did with style and tone and even the monster makeup was copied repeatedly so now what was frightening is clean and even family friendly. Remember The Munsters and family patriarch Herman? He was based on this design. Frankenstein drowned a little girl that he was tossing daisies into the water with! That is not quaint and family friendly.Frankenstein, while not as frightening as it was the day it opened, is still an entertaining film with a great deal of atmosphere and a wonderful story. It has inspired many imitators but none as great. You may not be frightened but you will enjoy it.",Frankenstein
304,d-callaghan-46578,A great take on the classic story that is Frankenstein,5,12 February 2021,"In the film ""Frankenstein"" Henry Frankenstein is an amazing scientist who becomes too absorbed in his experiments. He was the perfect first example of the phrase ""mad scientist"", he shut himself off from everything else in his life focusing exclusively on his work.His thirst for creating new life or recreating old life got worse and worse as he went from dissecting and reanimating animals to experimenting on human bodies. He would dig up bodies and steal organs, all to build his ""perfect body"" for reanimation. This lead to some ""creative differences"" with the university he was with so he had to leave and continue his research by himself.I particularly liked the scene when Dr. Waldman was making the distinction between the normal good quality brain and the ""abnormal"" criminal brain during his lecture. When Fritz broke in to steal the brain you could almost tell that something would go wrong and sure enough the normal brain is ruined so Fritz has to steal the abnormal one.After reanimating the body it spends its first days in darkness so when it is exposed to light things go sideways almost immediately. After his exposure to light it becomes apparent that Fitz had been beating ""Frankenstein"" which lead him to kill Fritz. When Dr. Waldman and Henry incapacitate ""Frankenstein"" they considered the matter dealt with. However ""Frankenstein"" managed to kill Dr. Waldman and began to look for Henry.When Henry discovers this he is overcome with guilty claiming ""I made it with my own two hands, I must destroy it with my own two hands."" During this time ""Frankenstein"" had been terrorizing the mountains where he killed a little girl which lead to a massive manhunt. Henry is feeling massive amounts of guilt as he feels the girl's death is his fault so he joins the manhunt. As the manhunt comes to it's inevitable conclusion it comes to the final face off between Henry and ""Frankenstein"" on top of the windmill. As Henry is thrown off leaving him almost dead the mob decides to set the windmill on fire trapping ""Frankenstein"" inside to burn to death. This I feel would've been the place to end off. I felt the ending scene with the maids and the baron talking was rather unnecessary and took away from the plot.",Frankenstein
305,dwanehoyt_jrstaff,An OK film,7,15 December 2010,"This film revolves around Dr. Frankenstein and his quest to recreate life and play the role of god. He reaches his dream and realizes that he's created a terrible epidemic that the town has to face. The only thing is that the monster he has created does not know any better as his brain was that of a criminal. Many frightful events take place but overall nothing that will make the viewer cringe, except maybe the scene with the little girl and the lake. The ending is pretty clear. Overall I pictured this film to be completely different and was actually really disappointed when I saw that it really wasn't as scary as the disclaimer at the beginning says.",Frankenstein
306,fauxface,its alive D:,5,20 October 2009,"In Frankenstein, the idea that a man can pick apart bits and pieces of dead bodies and assemble them into a working, functioning man is ludicrous. However, the movie takes this idea, creates an acceptable explanation, and the monster springs to life. It works because it takes something that is true- the existence of light waves- and extends it one step further to describe the properties of a newly discovered frequency. The message of the film, that God is the only one who should create life, is very convincing. The Monster was intended to be human, but is a murderer by nature. The Monster's temperament and actions are Dr. Frankenstein's punishment for his transgression against God.",Frankenstein
307,armycrazy,A truly great horror film,10,15 February 2012,"A wonderful classic horror film, it has a feeling of darkness and gloominess about it the entire film due to lighting and the sets used. While not particularly scary, it does give the viewer a feeling of suspense. And, at some points in the film, you cannot help but wonder if the monster is truly evil, or if it simply doesn't know any better. In the scene with the little girl, the monster plays along innocently enough, and even has a smile come across his face, only tossing the girl into the water because he has run out of flowers. You can even see the remorse and panic on the monster's face after he realizes what he has done. At the very end, when he is in the burning mill, I even felt sorry for the monster as he flailed about, desperately trying to get away from the flames. A great movie and a true classic.",Frankenstein
308,t-covino,Frankenstein,9,15 February 2013,"The film does a very good job in every scene at giving off an Erie mood when necessary and the feelings of the characters. When something bad is about to happen or things are about to get worse the lighting of the scene seem to correlate with the mood. The acting in this film is done very well, Dr. Frankenstein is brilliant in the way he portrays his madness for creation. Boris Karloff is brilliant in his role of the monster as well. There are a lot of new camera shots introduced as well that really stand out and just the way it is filmed at some points can be scary. Throughout the film you don't know if you should hate the monster or feel sorry for him. The common question of nature vs. nurture arises at many points and of the film is quite epic to day the least. It is a definant classic that set the bar for future horror films to come.",Frankenstein
309,RoseXGold,A good see,8,16 March 2013,"For it's time, this movie is still magnificent today. This movie was a lot better than some of the movies that are in theaters today. The concepts were really out of this world. What I enjoyed most?...the costumes(as always) and the make-up. The make-up used for ""The monster"" was so realistic. It did not take away from Karloff's features.What the make-up did do was dramatize his features. This created a more believable character. Being that this movie is black and white, I cant help but speak on the lighting. The lighting in this movie played a huge part in setting the ""mood"" of certain scenes. I don't want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it yet. However, pay attention to the specific scene where Frankenstein's creation is being lifted onto the roof top. The lighting in this scene is very dramatic. It's dark, chilling and extremely eerie. This is where the genius of movies comes into play. It's amazing how these effects set the tone for the audience.",Frankenstein
310,AlexandraJordan1987,Not the best,4,24 September 2014,"This movie, from a technical standpoint is good for its time period. The usage of lighting, even for a black and white film was ahead of its time. The director used good camera tricks to get his point across, for example always having the monster be above the view of the camera. Everyone else in the movie was filmed as a normal person would be, with normal alignment with the camera happening. When it was time for the camera to film the monster, he was treated as a different type of character. From a personal standpoint, I did not really enjoy this movie. I thought that it was slow, almost so much that it made it difficult for me to follow along with the story. The film didn't really pick up for me until the end scene where they are chasing the monster and burn the wind-mill tower that he was in.",Frankenstein
311,cjlance8,Analysis of Frankenstein,7,10 February 2015,"Frankenstein by James Whale was a great movie in many ways but wasn't really a horror movie. It's not like the horror movies today but it was still a good one. Dr. Frankenstein was so determined to create Frankenstein from human body parts. All of his faith in the monster was because he thought his wife believed in him. Once the monster became alive, he knew the monster would be no good. He started losing his faith slowly as the movie went on. James Whale did a good job of setting the mood for the movie because of the beginning with the background in the cemetery. The sky was gray and black and made look like a dark dreary day. Also two men sneaking around to dig a grave just makes it creepy. From there you could tell it was a dark movie. Everything else like the castle was the same way to. The castle seemed old and just didn't fit in but made it very creepy.",Frankenstein

It was really well made, and one of things that we looked at in our film class was the really great cinematography and lighting in his movie. The tonality of this piece fit the ""horror"" monster setting very well, and the shots in the movie all came together to make this such a memorable classic. It did a very good job at showing how the monster was almost human, but missing so many key things.There really wasn't much sound, but it really helped in some moments, creating tension.

The moral questions it asks itself and the terrifying answers it gives is an amazing site to behold. Colin Clive gives a great performance. Henry Frankenstein's intense obsession is portrayed perfectly. Clive is a true mad scientist. The atmosphere created matches the setting and tone of the movie. Never once does the viewer stop feeling the creepy vibe. Just the site of the tower makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Throughout nearly the entire film this continues save for a few moments. And those few out of place moments make a difference. On occasion there are awkward joke scenes thrown in, usually regarding Henry's father, that feel out of place. And the final climactic scene's impact is tragically tarnished by the brief lame wine drinking joke that follows it. This movie is very nearly perfect but you have to forgive its clumsy comic relief.",Frankenstein

Even though the characters were well rounded and this movie was a classic that was one of the first popular horror movies. If I had to pick a favorite character it would be Doctor Frankenstein. I liked the emotion he showed that he believed in his work even when no one else thought it was possible. I enjoyed that idea of the plot and the creation of life from just the power of nature. The beginning scene of him with resurrecting him using the power of the lightning stood out to me as one of the best scenes of the movie. The plot did show a steady progression it just didn't catch my attention throughout. One example of this is when Frankenstein threw the little girl into the lake and the lack of emotion shown by the father, I didn't find it realistic.",Frankenstein

This cutting edge film produced in 1931 pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable to show on screen. They actually had a warning at the beginning of the film for anyone who might be sensitive to the material. Boris Karloff as the monster did an excellent job with conveying emotion without having any actual lines. His use of body language mixed with the directors use of lighting really brought the monster to life. What's great about all these classic films is that they all use the lighting to their advantage to bring out the emotions the actors portray and to accentuate their body language. I think between the great acting, cinematography, and terrific dialogue, it is understandable why this movie is a classic. This film set the standard for future monster movies.",Frankenstein

Even though the movie itself is not an original idea, and it does not portray the book scene for scene, it still does a pretty good job showing people about the tale of Frankenstein. For me personally this movie is just okay, I never really cared for horror movies and this one is no expectation however, I can definitely see why so many people really like this movie. Even though it is very dated by today's standards, you can really see that a lot of effort went into this movie when you look at the environment that they have created combined with the costume and makeup effects done by Jack Pierce. I would recommend this movie to people that are into older horror movies and to people that like seeing these classics being made into a theatrical experience.",Frankenstein
318,markfinelli,The classic horror movie,10,2 October 2020,"Frankenstein (1931) is about an abnormally large monster figure with bolts perturbing from his neck and a flat head. It starts off with a prologue telling you generally what is about to unfold and I like this, it is definitely a different way to start a movie back then. Dr. Henry Frankenstein and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz, take a bunch of different body parts all from different corpses, and put them together. Fritz gets the brain from a criminal and doesn't tell Dr. Frankenstein about this. They electrify him, and shockingly he comes to life. He kills multiple people and causes rampage around the town.

The monster becomes violent as everyone is rejecting it and treating it as a monster/freak. The town turns on him as they chase him down with torches until they reach the windmill. The monster drags Dr Frankenstein into the the top of the mill house and ends up throwing him over the barrier onto the ground. The villagers burn down the building and the monster dies. This movie is such a classic halloween time movie and it really had a great plot.

Growing up, everybody knew the story of Dr. Frankenstein and his creation, it is one of the most iconic classics in horror and has been referenced endlessly. Upon watching this film I gained a new appreciation for the story, seeing it brought to life through beautiful, gothic black and white.While the performances can seem a little over the top at times (for example, Henry Frankenstein) it never comes off as campy or unserious. It keeps you interested, and the lack of a score to the film requires the actors to draw you in on their own.Overall, I don't think it would hold up to today's standards in horror.

If you are into being scared out of your mind, I would not suggest this movie because it was not too scary. It was the perfect amount of horror for me since I am such a baby; there were some scenes where I hid behind my hands though. The movie had a really nice flow, there was not any parts where I was wishing it would be over with. I really liked the way you can see that the monster tries to be good, but turns evil because of the people attacking him. I wish that they had shown more of him being nice, because I really like that, but I guess that would not have made it a horror film then.",Frankenstein

Frankenstein is perfectly dark and gritty with excellent full sets with many props that give the film its surreal darkness. The set design is truly wondrous, particularly Frankenstein's laboratory. The crashing lightning, diodes and bottles filled with substances give the classic feel of strange science at work. The film also has some intensely disturbing moments that create real horror without using the modern method of coating the walls with gore. The film never pulls a punch with the scare it just shows you what Frankenstein and his monster are capable of.",Frankenstein

324,m-visker,It's Still Alive!,8,18 February 2014,"I am glad to say that I have finally seen the classic movie Frankenstein! A movie that has inspired so many spin offs and a stepping stone for so many other films. Even though this film is considered a horror movie I wasn't frightened by it however still found it entertaining to watch and I can understand that for it's time the movie being scary to its audience. The film is a great accomplishment for its time, and I was impressed with its use of sound and the images. What really surprised me was that there was no soundtrack for the film, no music to set the tone, which meant that the film makers had to really step it up with the imagery with the film to convey emotion. And that is one thing that was extremely impressive was how beautiful the film was, something you wouldn't expect from a horror movie. Shots like the castle on the hill during the storm, or the scene with the monster and the little girl with the lake as their backdrop were really beautiful and definitely made the movie what it was. For the story line it was interesting to see how influential this movie has been for others. One theme I noticed was the selfishness of man and the misunderstanding of the creature created by man. Frankenstein is no doubt a classic and think it is a film that movie fans should take the time to watch, being that it has inspired and influenced so many other films and continue to inspire to this day.",Frankenstein
325,s-bodnar,Amazing,8,17 February 2014,"I felt this was a great film. Even though it was not exactly scary in my opinion, it still created a gloomy and tense atmosphere and featured relate-able and flawed characters. The shots of Frankenstein's mountainside castle are amazing. This structure alone adds much to the unsettling atmosphere of the film. The monster himself is also great. Although he doesn't have any true dialogue, his groans and grunts allow the viewer to sense his emotions in various scenes. In my opinion, this made the monster a more human character. The final scene of the film in which the monster is cornered into a windmill and is burned alive by the villagers is outstanding. The camera cuts between the ferocious villager outside of the structure and to frantic and helpless monster within it. This is a powerful ending to the film as the demise of the monster is shown through two different perspectives. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the horror genre, or to anyone interested in great films. ""Frankenstein"" truly stands out.",Frankenstein

So when I saw the Monster go on an unintended rampage, and winding up seriously harming several people, I felt for the poor thing. He didn't know what he was doing! Besides my personal feelings about the Monster and how he was clearly mistreated by the townspeople, I felt that this film was special. Look at the legacy that it has left. When you think of Frankenstein, most people would immediately picture Boris Karloff and his portrayal as the Monster, or ""?"" as he is called in the credits.My point about this film is that if you haven't seen this, and you consider yourself a fan of classic movies, you are doing yourself an injustice.

The film like Universal 's other monster film Dracula (1931), creates a cultural icon that is forever immortalized in pop culture. Boris Karloff's role as the innocent and macabre monster is genuine and quite iconic. Whenever we think of Frankenstein's monster, we think of this movie. The film had a great Gothic feel to it. The castle, the village, the torch-lights, and the villagers themselves. The plot was interesting, as we were exploring the world with the monster, and got to feel his struggle. He was not a bad thing, just innocent. He had no idea what he truly was, an amalgamation of flesh, brought back by a psychotic scientist. He was just a being trying to be free, but couldn't due to his lack of understanding, and his creation. The film is a horror film, but you don't see the creature as a monster by the end.

When we think of Frankenstein, what instantly comes to mind is the iconic monster that is a result of Dr.Frankenstein's mad experiments. However, the monster just seems to end up as a background character who only gets more screen time towards the end of the movie. The main cast doesn't seem as motivated in the film and are out shined by Collin Clive's performance. Later on in the film when the monster is being chased by the townspeople and is then burned alive in the windmill the film seems to just end there. There isn't any sense of closure between any of the characters and it only leaves you with more questions.

And this being an original horror, made this one of the most enjoyable movies I have watched, thus far. Boris Karloff's performance as Frankenstein was absolutely amazing. He may have looked terrible and frightening, but he really plays the role so well. You see the struggle of this monster being misunderstood. It may have been a Universal Horror work of fiction, but it had such a serious and deeper meaning, that unfortunately, we still deal with in the present. People often tend to judge other people just by the way that they look, which is exactly what the village people had done to Frankenstein. In the scene by the lake, Frankenstein didn't understand that the young girl pulling petals was not a flower herself, resulting in throwing her into the lake and ultimately killing her.

331,mxddiie07,One of the greats!,7,11 February 2021,"James Whale certainly established how a monster/horror film should play out. The ""horror"" that was meant to spook the audience only really reach as high as hitting a level or suspense, and not terror. The events that occurred in this film weren't predictable, and I admire the art and technique to making sure nothing seems that way. The suspense of the film started right at the beginning, as we are warned of the horror that lie ahead. When the beginning credits are rolled, our ""Monster"" is not accompanied by the actor's name... but rather a haunting ""?"". We have no judgement of who our monster is nor know was he could look like. This successfully builds for the audience to grow uncertain and dread what they will see. Our monster's appearance is unsettling because...well, he is a dead guy whose stitched together with five other body parts that weren't originally his. What did we expect? We grew unnerved of him as he became a harm to society, but also began to sympathize. He clearly wasn't oriented to this new life he was given. He didn't understand what was going on, or how he got there. When we are confused and in new settings with new faces it's out instinct to grow hostile as dangers arise. Frankenstein treated his experiment like an experiment, which yes, anyone could have guessed. But he was more than that. Colin Clive, who played Henry Frankenstein, almost overdid his role to act insane. Each character did their part to take the plot of the film and keep it running until it's very end, which pulls the suspense all the way through. The use of sound and lighting in this production helped a significant amount to create this feeling of dread and gloom. The low and high lights accentuated the disturbing monster and set the mood and tone. As for the sound, it created unease to the visuals we were receiving. There were some times when it was overdone and exaggerated... but for the most part during this time period sound was of course still a new thing and faults were to be made.

Boris Karloff is a legend when it comes to scary movies and the make up that was done to achieve the look of Frankenstein's monster was done really well and his acting done with no voice and only grunts is spectacular. I thought the actor (Colin Clive) who played Victor Frankenstein portrayed the character very well; especially the parts where he's kind of ""going mad"" when he's so wrapped up in creating another life from the remains of deceased human being.

The novel is populated by rich and deep characters and emotions while the film lacks all of the complexity and humanity of the novel and replaces it with flat cartoon characters. I can certainly see how the over-the-top performances and easy to understand story are easily accessible to audiences but I just have a hard time giving a favorable rating to such a shallow film.

It is a story that we have heard a thousand times before. Hell, at the point that this film was made, the novel had already been around for more than a hundred years and there had been several film adaptations too. Fortunately, it uses the source material sparingly and takes on an identity of its own. It really does work to its advantage and creates something iconic, much in the same way that the 1931 film Dracula did for that character and mythos. It had a theme more closely related to life and death and the innocence of life, then it did with horror. It has a driving pace that is absent from most monster movies of the time. This is something that it almost does too well, which brings about one of the very few detriments to the film. It breezes over a lot of things that more time should have been devoted to.This film MADE Frankenstein! Boris Karloff IS Frankenstein!

It set the basis for writers, actors, directors, and producers to build on and fully develop this genre. Other movies, Phantom of the Opera, Nosferatu, Dracula, The Wolf Man, to name a few, also have had the same effect. Frankenstein has another factor not included in any of these other classic movies. Boris Karloff and his superb performance are the second important reason credited to this film. Boris Karloff does so well with this role, that you can almost believe these events took place.

If I didn't know that it was a scant four years into the age of sound in cinema, I don't know if I would be as impressed. That being said, it WAS made in 1931 and stands as a huge achievement in film history. I was especially impressed with the use of sound. The quiet moments, where the images were allowed to tell the story as well as the moments filled with sound, like when the townspeople are all in a panic, and the church bells can be heard ringing. The visuals are also stunning. I loved the scene where Frankenstein was creating the monster. The severity of the thunderstorm outside matching the emotions of those horrified by what Henry is doing, and Henry himself who is lost in the chaotic joy of his success. As for the story itself, it's one we all by now know in some form. All the same, I felt utter sympathy for Frankenstein's monster who was all but abandoned by his creator. It spoke of the selfishness of humanity, and our ability to completely ignore our responsibilities. Henry's insistence that he could have it all, even as the people around him protested was irritating. I felt so bad for Elizabeth, and the monster alike for being stuck with him.In the end, I'll say this was a quality movie, and one that all horror and cinema fans should see.",Frankenstein

Everything about it gives it a creepy feeling from the beginning with the imagery with dark gray skies as the backdrop and going into Frankenstein's lab which is the best set piece of the movie and shows how the monster is made. The Monster is iconic from the movies and everyone dressing up as him at least once for Halloween. Boris Karloff plays the monster great and he brings emotion to a character who doesn't talk so well and you can see it in his face and body language throughout the film.

Not too dark, not too light, which was fitting for the tone of the movie. Another interesting note was how the monster was misunderstood, but a series of unfortunate things kept occurring which lead to it's sad ending. While some scenes were slow, it was pieced together fairly, and since it did invoke quite a couple of emotions out of me, I'd say it did it's job.

Over all the movie was rather contradicting, including the anger of the townspeople directed at Frankensteins monster and not Frankenstein himself. The end of the film left many questions unanswered and over all inconclusive. Even so, the movie did have some nice elements such as a lighting and references.

This film, to me, will be considered a classic even with all it's flaws. It's story is well done even if the ending was not well liked. The monster itself did provided an icon which would last generations and sometimes the monster (or bad ass protagonist, in some cases) can carry the film. This happens very rarely, but still. Still used today throughout all different genres of movies, Frankenstein has made a huge impact on your society and culture, thanks to this film. I haven't yet seen the second but I hear it is just as good, with the addition of The Bride of Frankenstein.",Frankenstein
345,JimDenney,Frankenstein,7,13 May 2015,"The classic Frankenstein is a horror film directed by James Whale in 1931. This genre of film is not my favorite, but I found this film to be interesting and somewhat entertaining. The special effects are really quite impressive given the time period the film was made, especially the electrical current effects during the scene where the monster comes to life. Even more impressive is the that the monster created by Dr. Frankenstein is not cheesy like many supposedly more modern horror films. The lighting, set design and cinematography are all very impressive, and even more so given the technological limitations at that time.",Frankenstein
346,Lukec1229,Frankenstein,9,23 September 2015,"As the first classic Universal monster/horror film I have seen, I have to say Frankenstein was not the least bit scary and the opening warning was a tad comical with that in consideration. Nevertheless, following the warning, from the very beginning of the actual film I found myself heavily invested in the story and characters. The film might not have been scary, but the development of the characters and the acting made them seem to be more realistic and have more depth than most characters in most current horror films. This is especially true of Frankenstein's monster which is ironic seeing as he has no actual dialogue. Another thing that caught my attention was the lighting in this movie. It was a very dark movie and I thought the way light was used kind of highlighted and set a more ominous atmosphere and gave it a really cool effect. I think what really stood out most for me about this movie though was the fact that often the people were more frightening and violent than the actual monster.",Frankenstein
347,randomguy1234567890,"Nice, raises some moral questions",7,30 September 2015,"I like Frankenstein. When you think about the implications here, it makes you wonder what you would have done. Give the monster a chance at life, or kill it before it can do harm (meaning before it escaped). Would it be wrong to give something like this life? That's an issue today in regards to human cloning, in a way. Something else of note is the way the crowd became a mob who simply wanted the monster to die, at any cost. Of course that was really the only option they had at that point, but the way they became a mindless mob out for blood was wrong. They were panicky and scared, and lashed out without proper thought. When you think about it, the monster was no worse than an untreated, mentally ill person.",Frankenstein
348,robbiejames-17251,Frankenstein (1931) - The mold of a good horror movie,10,16 September 2020,"The Universal Classic, directed by James Whale, and starring Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, and Boris Karloff, ""Frankenstein"" (1931) is objectively one of the most classic and influential movies in the horror genre. This movie has scenes that you'll remember for a long, long time. It's possible that to a younger audience, the black and white filming of the film adds to the eeriness. This isn't your average run-of-the-mill horror movie, with flashy jumping scenes made to get your heat racing, in fact, at times many would consider this movie slow-paced and not particularly exciting in comparison to today's horror movie. Although, that's kind of what makes it special. It isn't a horror movie you'd watch because you want to simply be scared and jump in your seat, its an honestly great movie and that will intrigue you.For a movie that effectively a doctor attempting to make a zombie, it's very serious and actually demands your attention. It lacks many things necessary to make a ""good"" horror film today, a score (music), blood, gore, gruesome murder scenes, flashy jumps that will make you jolt out of your seat, etc. Although, it's the good writing, suspense and acting that makes the film an exciting watch.By today's standards, despite its short run-time, the film can feel as though it's dragging on. Horror films today may be more stimulating and edgy, but I'm confident none will have the cultural impact Frankenstein had. Frankenstein (1931) is truly a must watch.",Frankenstein
349,k-boughton,More Than One Monster,3,16 February 2021,"In the beginning of the film scientist Henry Frankenstein had good intentions of creating a new scientific discovery by creating life. Although it was clear the idea of playing god was driving him insane, he was able to bring his creation to life. Although the creation was calm and curious when it came to life that part of its personality was short lived. After being taunted by Frankenstein's assistant Fritz the creation becomes a monster, killing Fritz, killing little Maria and injuring multiple people throughout the film. The argument I'm presenting is that ""The Monster"" was unaware of what he was doing every time he injured or killed someone, he was unaware of everything he did in his ""life"". Therefore is someone a monster when they are unaware that they are causing harm. Fritz on the other hand was aware every time he approached the monster with fire he was upsetting him. Henry Frankenstein was aware that he was creating something not of this world, he did nothing to protect others from his creation once he knew it was capable of committing murder. In this film there is more than one monster, who the monster is to you just depends on your definition of the word.I also have to touch on the lack of music in the film. Music in a horror film is what builds suspense, leads the viewer to know that a scary moment is coming. The lack of music in this film made the intense or scary moments seem as though they came out of nowhere. Although the scary moments were shocking I wouldn't be able to describe them as scary.",Frankenstein
350,paleowildchild,Very bad!,1,14 February 2021,"The only redeeming quality of this film was that it was one of the first horror movies ever made. I wrote an entire page of notes, and I could not find one good thing to say about the movie. All of the fight scenes were poorly done. I've seen some older movies with better fights. The passage of time was also very unclear. For example, was the toast scene before or after the wedding?As for character development, there was not much. Dr. Frankenstein was the only one with any significant character development. He went from mad scientist to madly in love. The monster had no character development whatsoever, and his motives were very unclear. For example, why did he go after Dr. Freankenstein? How did he know where to find the Dr? Why did he bring Dr. Frankenstein into the mill instead of just killing him when he had the chance?Finally, it is important to address the set staging for a moment, it was rather careless, from crooked picture frames to ones that didn't have pictures at all. At one point the set caught on fire and no one noticed.",Frankenstein
351,griffinsnyder,"""It's alive!""",6,17 February 2021,"Frankenstein is a entertaining movie, but I feel the acting and dialogue is a bit overexaggerated and ridiculous at times. Maybe this was done to convey emotion in the characters, but compared to today, it comes off as cheesy.
The scene where Frankenstein's assistant steals the brain is one such scene. The assistant is extremely clumsy and even drops one of the brains. He is also startled by a model of a skeleton hanging beside the table where the brains are located. Keep in mind, this skeleton was not hidden or disguised in anyway. It was simply out in the open, hanging there. The assistant should have clearly seen the skeleton earlier, or at least known of its existence, so it makes no sense for him to be startled when he bumps into it. Despite this minor issue, it is easy to see that this film has clearly paved the way for countless other horror movies. The concept of raising the dead had not been captured in cinematography the way that Frankenstein does. To have a hulking beast made of pieces of cadavers dug up in a grave is certainly morbid, but to have this creature then come to life and carry out simple tasks is terrifying. Seeing a gigantic man with sewn-together body parts being struck by lightening an ""re-animated"" is not only frightening, but defies the beliefs of most religions. Man does not, and should not, have the power of the Gods.The 'power of the Gods"" as stated earlier can be seen in many different ways. The ability to essentially defy death is something that is usually attributed to the Gods. No mortal being has the inherent power to do this, but Dr. Frankenstein shows that we humans should not be restrained by the bonds the Gods placed upon us. Frankenstein's defiance for death only proves that we are not lesser beings to the Gods, but with the right technology we can be equals, if not their superiors.
When Frankenstein gives life to the corpse he has before him, he uses lightening to shock the body and jumpstart it. Lightening is a symbol of power, and the Greek God Zeus wielded lightening as his weapon. The use of lightening in the film is again a sign that we humans are but equals to the Gods, not their lesser.
But this film also warns of the dangers when attempting to become a God; Frankenstein's monster kills many throughout the story, even severely injuring Frankenstein himself at the end of the movie. This film serves as a warning and a message to those who seek the path of the divine: be prepared for a reckoning.The point is this film was the first to put the undead on stage, and its creation has forever changed the world of cinematography.What I find to be the most intriguing aspect of this film is the public's misconception of who Frankenstein is. Many assume Frankenstein to be the monster, when in fact it is the scientist who created the monster who was named Frankenstein. I attempted to find a distinct answer as to why this had occurred, but the only conclusion I came to was that it is common for films to be named after a main character, and in the horror genre this usually ends up being the antagonist, such as Dracula, The Invisible Man, and countless others. So because of this unintentional conditioning, the public wrongly assumes that Frankenstein is the monster.",Frankenstein
352,AlexCWM,THE Horror Precedent,9,15 February 2021,"""Frankenstein"" is an amazing movie that sets the standard for horror, even in the modern day. With gloomy sets and foreboding atmosphere, ""Frankenstein"" fully immerses the viewer in a truly creepy tale. The set design is amazing, with symbology such as a statue of Jesus representing Dr. Frankenstein's attitude towards ""playing god."" Lighting is consistent throughout, making the graveyard and laboratory into dramatic places.""Frankenstein"" also gets its story right. The unique, terrifying tale, though similar to the original novel in very few ways, keeps the viewer absorbed.

Not to say that I haven't enjoyed films even older than this one, but I feel that in what it's trying to do, scare, horrify, terrorize, it's not so effective anymore. To explain further, it's a bit boring, and drones on in certain instances, and doesn't do a satisfying job at being a horror film. On this basis I can't rate it as good since In fact we are viewing this in the modern era, and I can't say it will be a good film to watch. However I do appreciate it as an historical piece which is why I chose to watch it, and for that it interests me, but not entertains.",Frankenstein
354,Piratezombie7,The Monster in the Man,9,5 October 2011,Frankenstein is the classic example of a horror film gone right. A wonderful adaptation of Mary Shelley's book. Boris Karloff plays the Monster in the film and forever sets the tone for how the monster should be depicted. The movie shows the monsters birth at the hand of Dr.Frankenstein and supposed death in the burning windmill. The movie strays away from the book in quite a few ways but all together tells the story excellently and completely in the small amount of time the movie takes to be watched. At times in the movie the viewer almost feels bad for the monster pitying the way the men treat him but in the end it is made apparent that he is in fact a vile creature who was never supposed to be at all. In all it is a great horror movie worthy of multiple viewings.,Frankenstein
355,a-choppa,"A young scientist, Henry Frankenstein attempts to bring a corpse back to life but to his surprise creates a monster.",4,30 September 2012,"I know this may offend many Frankenstein fans out there, even though this was the only version of the story and film that I have seen, and I have nothing to compare it to, I was very unimpressed. Putting the time period aside, and the fact that it wasn't anything like horror movies from today, it wasn't so much the mechanicals of the movie that turned me off (the lighting, melodramatic acting, or lack of color) but the story. I was not entertained the entire time and found myself bored. Everything was predictable, I always found myself guessing what would happen next, and was always correct. (Even the scene in which the monster kills the young girl, I saw that coming the minute she entered the storyline). I have enjoyed every film from the 1930s that I have viewed thus far and this is one I would never watch again. I can appreciate Boris Karloff's acting as it was very impressive for the difficult non-speaking part he had to play. And I did like the underlying sympathy that I found myself feeling for the monster and his odd relation to a newborn discovering the world.",Frankenstein
356,Natybug97,Not my cup of tea.,6,25 February 2014,"Having read the original story by Mary Shelley, this movie, being a classic horror film, was a bit of a disappointment for me. I do understand that this is not an actual adaptation of the book, but rather an adaptation of a theater production of the story, but so much of the character development that happened in the book is missing entirely. This black and white was released shortly after Dracula and was Universal's second movie in the horror genre. The film contents themselves are not horrific by any means, perhaps it was the story itself that frightened the society of that time. Dr. Frankenstein claiming to have God's ability to create and give life to an inanimate life form made from bits and pieces of bodies that he had excavated from the cemetery. This is what frightened people and made them even protest when Frankenstein delivers the line where he compares himself to God. Even towards the climax of the film when the creature accidentally kills the little girl by drowning her is a an awful scene that took audiences by surprise by it's brutality. This was unheard of at the time, to kill an innocent in such a manner, despite the fact that the creature did not actually know any better. The film itself is well done and accurately conveys to the audience the tone of the film. The darkness and the isolation of the tower sets the ominous tone that carries out to the end of the film. Even the opening scene helps out this dark theme as it opens up with Frankenstein and his assistant waiting to dig up a freshly buried corpse. There is also no background music, aside from the beginning and end credits, that distract the audience. The lightning is so present in the beginning and up until the creation of the creature that it helps build up to the event and creates the horror of that scenario. The element of fire helps to foreshadow the end of the film and how it would all end in fire because that's the one thing that the creature fears above all else. Perhaps this is not the blood and gore horror that we have to come to expect in today's modern genre, but for the time period that this film was created in it was a novelty and the fear that it created was possibly even genuine.",Frankenstein
357,SaveFerris97,"Clearly a classic, but lacking in a few ways",7,19 February 2014,"Frankenstein (1931), directed by James Whale, is a classic horror movie meant to frighten the audience with sacrilegious terrors. It's not just used for a rush of adrenaline; its deep moral keeps it from becoming a simple ""blood and gore"" horror flick. The film it truly made a noticeable effort to be important in its cinematic form. To start off the film, the un-burying of a corpse is already unsettling, but the twilight lighting, the forsaken crucifix in the background and the close-up of Dr. Henry Frankenstein's face bearing his wild eyes make for a very creepy beginning. Dr. Frankenstein's desperate will to play god is the driving force behind the plot, and letting the audience know both how crazy he is about his dream and how far he is willing to go to achieve it. His famous line, ""It's alive, it's moving, it's alive! It's alive, it's alive, it's alive! It's ALIVE!"" shows his ecstasy as he raves around the room. He has yet to realize the flaws in his creation, the least of which being his phobia of fire. Fire symbolizes The Monster's flaws, which is hinted at through the camera's slow fading of a scene until all that is visible is the burning light, before that also disappears. Examples of this are when Fritz is torturing The Monster with a waving torch, and when the angry group of villagers wave their torches down the trail to the monster. The movie is creepy overall, but a major drawback of the fundamentals of the entire film is the lack of sound. Instead of a thrilling score to sway audience members toward each emotion, the sound throughout every scene lacks depth. Unfortunately, this is a flaw that could have easily been remedied. Frankenstein's moral is indisputably clear. Dr. Henry Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive, is desperate to play god. He is a crazed doctor with a ghastly dream to fulfill: to create man. But he also somehow understands the consequences, as at the last moment before his creation, played by Boris Karloff) is woken, he falters and betrays his recognition of how real his dream is becoming (pushed to this by his fiancée, Elizabeth), and how wrong it is. His creation, however, rises from the grave (or, as he is kind of a quilt of many corpses, the graves) and although the Dr. wishes to be proud of his dream coming true, after only a little while he can no longer bear to see his monster alive. He flees to his home, and prepares to marry Elizabeth, and because of his blatant skirting of his responsibilities as The Monster's rightful killer, it goes on a murderous rampage, but only because it doesn't understand consequence (he must have learned that bit from his creator) and is angry at being not only prodded at but at being left to fend for himself. As the Dr.'s life is now in danger (his life being his loved ones and his reputation) he finally faces the monster he created, but only to let others do his dirty work and kill his dream. After the misunderstood creation dies by the only thing he really fears, the Dr. happily marries Elizabeth, recovers, and everybody raises a toast to the house of Frankenstein. Therein lies the frustration of every audience member. Seeing the injustice of the man who played god live happily ever after despite the blood on his hands is the sole cause for the dissatisfaction of this film.",Frankenstein
358,s-lajeunesse,Quality movie with a few flaws,6,4 February 2015,"Frankenstein was a quality monster movie for the time of it's release and was really one of the first original horror films of its time. Boris Karloff played the monster beautifully and his character did not require lines or dialogue because his feelings were conveyed through his actions. The cinematography was strong in some aspects including the scenes where the camera seemed to follow the actor or actress. the characterization, on the other hand, left some to be desired. the main character, Henry Frankenstein, seemed to have a complete change in personality at one point in the film and that made the movie seem not well thought out.

359,lutzkevinandrew,Frankenstein,8,30 September 2015,Henry Frankenstein played by Colin Clive is wonderfully fascinating and grabs the audiences attention at all times. This film definitely stands out from others because of how original it is. The audience was not expecting a story that could be so powerful and lead to so many remakes. Frankenstein's character was interesting because it showed how obsessed someone can get over their creation. This film is black and white but still leaves the audience with a sense of fear. A scene in particular that may stand out from others in a way could be the one where the man caries the dead child in his arms through the town. This film most defiantly brought fear to the eyes of the audience.,Frankenstein

The scientist really nailed the part of being absorbed into his work and crazed. The lighting, on the other hand, was only mediocre. It was really only a black movie. there weren't much ""white"" parts in it. It actually got very hard to see several times. Although, the dark did help in some scenes. It did give more of an eerie tone to the scene.There were some impressive camera shots, though. Especially in one scene when he lifts the monster up in the storm and the camera looks directly up and you can see the lighting come down straight to the monster.

361,richardcoppage,Don't get too excited..it's not that good,7,6 December 2005,"Frankinstein is good. Don't get me wrong. Take it from me. As a kid, I LOVED the classic monster movies. The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Draclula..all of them. Now that I see Frankinstein years later, it is not as scary as it used to be. The sound is ""chopped"" up, the monster isn't really a monster. It's a man, but with makeup on his face. Boris Karloff does a great job of acting as the monster. He is the movie. The only ""real"" problem with this film is that it really that dark of a monster movie. Draclula is the darkest of all the classic films. Frankinstein has heart, a misguiding, but good natured heart. If we all look at the movies made back then to now..you would say,"" Frankinstein looks so stupid!"". But think of it. Back in the 1930's this film was The Exorcist to the people. Frankinstein was so scary, so freighting..some children couldn't even sleep. I think everyone should at least give this classic a try. I mean..what do you have to lose? Hopefully you can see behind the black and white and see a really good film.",Frankenstein

Frankenstein desires to create life out of death by using body parts of dead bodies and creating a patchwork human. a Truly appalling idea, but not an idea stemming from malice thought, but from curiosity and intrigue. Overall the film was enjoyable. Due to the quality of movies in this time period it is hard to be ""scared"" by this film, but I'm sure back in 1931 it was a frightening experience. Interestingly neither the monster or Frankenstein seem to be blamed for the actions of the monster. The film could have done a better job of showing the view of the people of the town and their knowledge of the situation. At one point near the end of the film everyone seems to accept that the monster had killed the girl and we did not know how they knew or what they knew.Overall an enjoyable film considering the time period and a film that paved the way for future monster flicks.",Frankenstein

The scene where he was playing with the little girl by the water really made you realize that he isn't this malicious monster, but a misunderstood creature who is unfamiliar with the world around him. A little girl was throwing flowers into the water and gave some to him to throw with her. He had a childlike excitement at the activity, but when he ran out of flowers he threw the girl into the water. He didn't think it would hurt her, he just wanted to keep throwing things into the water. He couldn't tell the difference between the girl and the flowers at that point. The ending of the film followed shorty after, and I'm sure anyone can guess what it was.

366,skottyrock,FrankenClassic!,10,10 December 2004,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*1931's Frankenstein holds up surprisingly well against such modern horror fare as Ashton Kutcher's (scary) Just Married, Hilary Duff's (terrifying) Lizzie McGuire Movie and anything starring those (just plain petrifying) Olsen twins. In this relatively short film (the shorter the better, I say, eh, James Cameron!), we witness a kooky 'young doctor-slash-necrophiliac', Dr Henry Frankenstein (Clive) and his right hand man, a hunchbacked midget named Fritz (Frye), scouring the countryside for dead bodies for some strange experiment that could change the face of science as we...er, then knew it. The doctor's intentions seem fairly sound, you know, he desperately needs the bodies for scientific purposes and all that jazz. The same, however, cannot be said about weirdo Fritz (a tired old deviant from way back), whose primary motive for helping the doctor with the dead bodies just ain't explained. It seems Fritz is prepared to go to any length to please, including stealing a brain-in-a-jar from a local medical university-kinda-place for the doctor's experiment. No Questions Asked. (And Fritz does go through with it, too, though the stupid fool inadvertently steals the brain of a killer, which subsequently really stuffs things up!)We also soon discover that Dr F - fully stocked with smelly old corpse bits (and a killer brain to boot!) - is soooo busy up in his hilltop laboratory-slash-windmill he can't even get it on with his bride-to-be, urbane and refined Elizabeth (Clarke). She feigns concern - she's actually just tired of waiting for her lover to consummate the passion that constantly threatens to erupt from within her - and cons poor old sods, hanger-on nobody Victor (Boles), and experienced head of medicine Dr Waldman (Van Sloan), into accompanying her on a search-and-destroy (her pent-up urges) mission.On arrival at the dark and dusty windmill on the hill, the threesome discovers that Dr F and dorky Fritz don't got no time to see y'all. Feisty Elizabeth chucks a hissy fit about being given the brush off by her fiancé; Dr Waldman bangs on the door until his head starts to bleed (?); and resourceful Victor spices it up by calling Dr F ""a crazy sonofa...."" On hearing them fightin' words, Dr F decides enough is enough and admits the threesome, all the while informing (or should that be, warning) them that what they are about to see is something marvelous, something outrageous, something unbelievable (and, no, I don't mean a Chevy Chase post-Vacation box office hit!). They are going to see history being made: Dr Frankenstein's lil fella (Karloff) (you know, the collection of mismatched body parts all sewn together) brunged back to life! At this point in time (in the film, not now), you can just imagine the many thoughts running through young Elizabeth's mind on witnessing firsthand her fiancé's delusions of power and prestige. Thoughts such as: ""Elizabeth, what the hell are you doing?"" and ""Well, he is a doctor..."" and ""He'd better not try anything on the wedding night. I'm in this for the money, and that's all!"" and ""What a dork! Look at that lousy haircut!"" and ""I know, I'll poison his tea and collect the insurance money!""Now, IMDbphiles, an exclusive run through Dr F's oft-rehearsed procedure: Cue the storms, thunder and lightning - check; Uncover the body so the audience gets a thrill - check; Tell Fritz off for being a dim, sycophantic layabout - check; Keep an eye on the body as it goes up in a cage-like contraption through the ceiling towards the sky - check; Act all weird and decidedly manic in order to appease studio heads - check; Let the body be zapped a few (hundred) times before bringing it down for inspection - check; Gasp and cry out ""It's alive! It's alive!"" when the once-lifeless body starts to move - check.It certainly is alive! And quite a sight to behold. I mean, with all the makeup and hair products, one could be excused for mistaking him for J.Lo in drag. And as the towering monster saunters around the countryside, looking for friends (or foes) one gets the feeling that Karloff's characterisation of the monster included some unambiguous reference to TV travel program hosts. See Dr F's monster making his way through a gorgeous bushy meadow; see Dr F's monster taking in the views of a breathtaking lake set against a beautiful alpine mountain; and see Dr F's monster interacting with a sweet-faced local child playing with her kitty. It's all very Channel Nine's 'Getaway'.In conclusion, I must comment on the acting prowess of not only Clive, but that of Clarke, that saucy vixen of yesteryear. The two really light up the screen, bringing passion to their characters. Van Sloan is equally adept in his role as the concerned doctor, while Kerr brings a bit of good old English sense and sensibility to the role of the old German Baron Frankenstein (?). Minor players Boles and Frye have little screen time (the latter is killed off halfway through the film). Finally, Karloff impresses as Frankenstein's creation, exuding feelings of angst, anger ... and amoral grunting noises better suited to porn flicks.After seeing Frankenstein, I think it deserves to be the movie of the moment. I mean, any film that features a mute sexually ambiguous killer in dire need of some blond highlights and a head-to-toe fashion makeover, deserves the attention of Queer Eye! I can see it now, the new and improved Frankie on the TV chat show circuit, promoting the benefits of facial cream (to hide those sunken cheeks), hair products (to disguise that squarish head) and cosmetic surgery (to fix those droopy eyelids).If you don't have a copy of this film classic, run, run, run up to the windmill-slash-video store on the hill and grab a copy. You won't be disappointed!",Frankenstein
367,tbello22,Classic Monster Film,8,3 March 2010,"I am a huge fan of todays horror films and this movie is one that inspired a lot of the monster movies that came after it. The whole setting is very creepy with Fritz and Frankenstein stealing the casket then getting the brain at the college. One thing I didn't know before watching this film was that the brain that was put inside of the monster body was one that was from a criminal. That makes a lot more sense to me now that I know why the monster killed the little girl. The film is very short, only 70 minutes long and not many films today are less than an hour and a half. Watching it goes by very fast because you are so curious as to what is going to happen with the monster. This is the original in a long collection of the Frankenstein series, I am looking forward to watching the next one, even though it probably isn't as good. Some memorable scenes are when he says ""It's Alive"" and when he throws the little girl into the water. I was not expecting that to happen I thought it was going to show that he has changed and had feelings. When the dad of the little girl walks while holding the dead body it is disturbing and everyone who sees it is shocked.

368,kylebristol12,"""It's Alive!""",8,9 February 2013,"James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" is today considered a seminal work of horror cinema. At the time it was released, there must have been parts that audiences found truly terrifying. Films at this time were meant to entertain, not to incite panic. The true genius of Whale's film lies in its production value, in how it conveys the story (a story that was, by 1931, already ingrained in the public's mind). Subtle yet intricate camera work accent the film's most emotional scenes. Two scenes that come to mind include a scene set in a town which includes a slow, poignant tracking shot, and the film's infamous ending sequence. I especially enjoyed how Whale used different forms of lighting, especially in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory and the outside scenes. These techniques are primarily what give the film the eerie, brooding atmosphere it is so well-known for.",Frankenstein
369,tiffany_demeo,Frankenstein,9,18 October 2010,"I was very excited to watch the first version of Frankenstein. Even though this movie was not ""scary"" at all, I did enjoy it. The setting of where it was filmed helped give it the ""scary""feel. The buildings looked old and all the rooms were dark with only a single light lit. The background music and the noises through out the film were suspenseful. When Frankenstein first ""wakes up"" he moves very slowly and you don't think he's bad, but then the movie progresses. In the 1930's when this was produced no one has ever seen anything like this film thats why it was such a bug hit. If this filmed was produced now as a scary movie it most likely would not be a hit at all. But I think that this movie was really good for the 1930's and I enjoyed it.",Frankenstein
370,c-farrell7,Purely a Classic,6,15 December 2010,Frankenstein is a very visual and a very stylistic film. The mise-en-scene was very well thought out and executed with great detail. The scenery was decked out with Gothic architecture and costume and the laboratory of Dr. Frankenstein contained many elaborate props and scientific equipment. The special effects used with the laboratory equipment was very impressive for the time and added to the suspense of the experiment scenes. At least one actual Tesla Coil built by Nikola Tesla himself was used in the film. The timing of the thunder claps enhanced the fear and suspense of the reanimation scenes. The makeup was also very impressive for the time.,Frankenstein
371,k-hotaling1,Frankenstein,7,9 March 2011,"This movie is simply a classic. Frankenstein is seemingly timeless and important as well. It must have been one of the first movies to introduce the idea that science was seemingly evil in it's ways. The acting was excellent and the ""monster"" portrayed a wide array of emotions and feelings. It is great to watch a horror film and be able to sympathize with such a creature. This movie really made me feel like I was taken back into their time. I think it allowed people to use their imagination, something that remains true to this day. This film is extremely atmospheric, and tends to be a little bit creepy at times. I believe this movie was filmed carefully and attentively and the different shots and angles were interesting and well thought out.",Frankenstein
372,sushifish55,I'm curious to how people found this to be scary,5,10 March 2011,"I'm curious as to how the bone chilling tale of Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"" got turned into this? What I found so freighting of the original Frankenstein's Monster was that he was capable of complex thought and emotions ;he also had enhanced agility not just strength. I mean he threatens Victor to make another monster because he is lonely for companionship! This Frankenstein was nothing more than an over sized 4 year old with down syndrome! I was more frightened of Chunk from ""The Goonies""! Now I know this was the 1930's and they really haven't seen much like this before but once you got past the fact he was raised from the dead wouldn't you think, ""Hey this monster moves slower than my grandmother. I could just side step him, get the heck out of there, and come after him with a mob!"" I'm quite aware that people of today are spoiled with fear from modern horror movies and so maybe that's why all of this just looked silly to me. Now if people found this to be scary in the 1930's could you imagine going back and showing ""The Exorcist"" to them; they'd literally pee their pants! The movie It's self was well made and there's a wonderful performance by Colin Clive as Doctor Frankenstein. I would trash Boris Karloff's performance but he worked well with what they gave him. I don't think it was his idea to turn the monster into a bumbling idiot. The reason I rate this film so low even though it was well made because when I watch a ""Horror"" movie I expect it to be at least some what scary and during this film I only laughed.",Frankenstein
373,pturner1010,It's STILL alive and kicking!,8,12 June 2011,"SYNOPSIS: Man creates monster by stitching together body parts of the recently deceased and giving it the brain of a criminal.James Whale's original film version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein story is an undisputed classic of the horror genre. While lacking in the scares and gore of more contemporary entries into the genre, the ideas and themes played out here are smarter than many a modern day science fiction/horror mash-up. The film is unlikely to make a young audience of today scream with terror but it still manages to muster sympathy for the hopeless story of the victimized monster. Watching the film now conjures memories of many films it has influenced. Sympathetic, misunderstood monsters, crazed arrogant scientists and a screaming damsel in distress all feel overly familiar now but this film would have served up a powerful and original telling of an original tale back in the 1930s. More modern films that spring to mind while watching Frankenstein included '28 Days Later' with its chained monster being provoked by an unsympathetic captor, 'Edward Scissorhands' with its misunderstood protagonist chased out of town by angry villagers/suburbanites and 'The Terminator' with its unstoppable man-made monster on the rampage (to name just a few!) The influence of this film on contemporary cinema is immeasurable. The less said about recent rip-off 'Splice', the better.The story is tightly structured and the script has its faults but keeps the action rattling along at a brusque pace. The opening scenes of body-snatching are intriguing and followed by some grating scenes of exposition. However this is soon forgotten as the creation of the monster becomes a great set-piece that builds suspense and climaxes with the iconic cry of 'It's Alive!' The supporting cast is lumbered with a fair share of exposition-spouting, theatrically-staged scenes and the tone of the film veers wildly between moments of dread and horror and moments of comic relief with Frankenstein's father but the progression of the narrative is overall logical, well-crafted and fast-paced (particularly for a film of this age).Frederick Kerr plays the Baron Frankenstein with an easy comic touch, mumbling and bumbling like a grumpy but amiable old git. Colin Clive delivers a performance that is far from subtle and contains far too much of the familiar theatrical style of acting from so many classic old movies where the character stares just off camera into the distance when thinking. However the award for really over doing this has to go to Mae Clarke playing Elizabeth whose performance would be ridiculed if it was in a modern film. Karloff plays the monster perfectly, inviting sympathy with his tragic mix of innocence and rage.The actors work well together and despite some overly theatrical thesping, the cast is generally believable and carry the narrative convincingly. Whale never allows the pace to slow and there are some moments of interesting cinematography. However the majority of the camera-work is simple and functional, restricted as they were with the technology of the time. There is a distinct lack of musical soundtrack and this is a blessing as overly powerful orchestral scores can be a distraction in many classics from the thirties.The special effects and set design are also worth mentioning as the interior of the windmill is an iconic construction filled with convincing contraptions that create memorable, iconic moments of the (re)birth of the monster. Karloff's scars and screws add to this to ensure the monster is one of the most enduring and recognizable images of horror cinema.The idea that God must not be challenged and that scientific progress will KILL US ALL is persistent but not forced down throats with quotes from the Bible. The arrogance and madness of the scientist is punished. However the innocence of the monster and the guilt of the aristocratic protagonists are not fully explored. The manipulation of the masses by the aristocrats is touched on but not overtly dealt with as a major theme At barely over an hour long the film is over before anyone could possibly have a chance to get bored of it. In fact the climax feels rushed and could have been more drawn out. More sympathy could have been created for the monster and the connection between creator and creation could have been explored further with a longer third act. Frankenstein is very enjoyable and clearly a hugely influential work in the cinematic horror genre. It is an easy watch even for viewers raised on blood, guts, slashers and torture porn. Iconic, sympathetic and deserving of its classic status.",Frankenstein
374,dzuber32,ughhhhhhh (Monster Voice),6,23 February 2012,Frankenstein is one of the original horror movies. Although it can't compare to the horror movies of today for its time it was deemed one of the great horror of it time and was a big box office hit and I can see how that is. It had great cinematography with great lighting and set designs.The camera man should have received an award for the work he did there are a couple scenes were remarkable. The sound was OK the sounds of Frankenstein were OK but could have been a little bit louder and dramatic in my eyes. Boris Karloff was great acting as the Monster and Colin Clive did a great job as Dr. Frankenstein. The set has a feel of Transylvania and reminds me of a show took from this idea called the Munsters.,Frankenstein
375,Morgan_Leslie93,Favorite monster film of that time,8,19 October 2012,"Such a great representation of why man should not try to play God in the movie ""Frankenstein"" (1931). The moral is a great lesson for all humanity and I think the movie was fantastic on getting that point across. This movie was definitely my favorite monster film of that time. It's really hard me to believe that the movie was only mad in 1931 because the effects were really great especially when Dr. Frankenstein had created the monster with the whole set up and the trolley that lifted the body towards the sky to get hit by lighting. Another thing I want to point out is that there were so many great photography moments in the movie that really helped create the atmosphere. The acting was great as well, with how each character had reacted and treated the monster really affected on how he acted towards them. Must see movie that is a great classic monster film.",Frankenstein
376,mleonardo60,Frankenstein (1931),8,15 February 2016,"This movie was released in the prime time of monster movies and did not disappoint. The cinematography and acting are what carry this film to success. Boris Karloff was the perfect man to play The Monster and does a masterful job. He does an incredible job portraying to the audience what the monster is feeling even without the benefit of any speaking. Colin Clive also does a great job in the movie. As Henry Frankenstein, he clearly gets across the passion and ambition of Henry.The cinematography goes a long way toward setting the tone and mood in various scenes of the movie. The dimly lit laboratory shows the secrecy, and dangerous nature of the experiment. It clues in the viewer on the fact that all will not go well.

377,csharrow1994,great,8,18 February 2014,"This early horror film is a classic. Although I did not find it scary, I can see how it could be considered that in the early 30s, when there wasn't many other horror films to be created yet. I think this adds to the greatness of the film. This was one of the first horror films to be created, so to see what people once thought was terrifying, and to see where horror films once started, is cool. Colin Clive and Boris Karloff are both phenomenal actors in this film. Karloff brought the monster alive, and did so in a way where I felt sympathy for ""the villain."" I was a tad disappointed with the way it ended, but over all, the cinematography was fantastic, and the sound effects used really help portray it as a scary situation.",Frankenstein

A beautiful work of cinema, at it's time a sheer masterpiece. The cinematography is edgy and progressive lending itself to the fast paced horror theme the plot line includes. While I do think it is an absolute classic, the plot lacks a little in really explaining the monster like he is articulated in the book. Boris Karloff has the perfect structure to fit the monster makeup, being that he is tall and broad-shouldered with a sharp rectangular face.",Frankenstein

It is a film about a mad scientist Henry Frankenstein who creates a living being from dead parts. He is unable to control the monster and chaos ensues. Boris Karloff who played the monster did an excellent job and was very convincing as an unintelligent and bewildered new life. His use of grunts, staggering body movements, and facial expressions relay to the viewer that the monster is truly helpless. The lack of music made the movie less suspenseful than it could have been. Colin Clive's acting was annoying and unoriginal. In my opinion Frankenstein could have been portrayed much better by another actor, one with more conviction and emotion. The use of cinematography is what made the film memorable, as the camera is able to capture beautiful views of the mountains, cliffs, and ocean.",Frankenstein
380,dlabarge-33974,Well shot but not a fan.,6,1 October 2015,"Growing up, I've always found Frankenstein to be a monster and I still do. Of course, Boris Karloff isn't very scary in Frankenstein, but his acting as the monster was done quite well. I know if I was back in 1931 seeing this I'd probably be a bit scared. There were a few great shots in the film, especially while Frankenstein is looking for the monster in the home and the shot continues looking in through a doorway. I haven't seen any film from that time so far do something like that cinematography wise. It seemed innovative for the time. Some things I didn't like was that the back drop in the scenes were easily painted skies. Some of the other acting in the film was not quite there. Also, I believe with the censored version of Frankenstein would not make sense excluded the scene in which the monster meets the little girl. The mob of people would've been angry about nothing. The mob didn't know of the death of the teacher. It just doesn't make sense to me.",Frankenstein
381,eroberts-93865,Frankenstein Review,8,12 October 2015,"On many levels, I would call this movie grand. Between the talent level of the actors, the interesting and varied sets, and the questions posed by the story itself, the movie operates on a larger scale than one might expect based on the production value(adjusted or otherwise).Colin Clive, for example, plays Dr. Frankenstein. Frankenstein is a man enthralled with the idea of creating life, without giving much (if any) thought to the consequences of such an action. Clive brings a dimension to this character that makes him hard to dislike. This manic, obsessive character complements Karloff's stoic, tortured monster in a way that strikes the audience, prompting thoughts of philosophical questions about consequences and ""playing god."" While the sets were not always perfect (today's standards aside), there was a lot to work with. There was a lot of movement in the movie, indoors and out, especially within Dr. Frankenstein's cramped laboratory. This set in particular was manipulated in such a way through clever camera-work to keep every shot within the small space fresh.The timeless questions and themes, cinematography and consistently excellent acting have helped Frankenstein age extremely well. This movie remains relevant today, and certainly will for many years to come.",Frankenstein
382,Emmajoy93,Great American classic monster/horror film,8,3 May 2016,"Frankenstein, directed by Arthur Edison, is a classic and definitive monster/ horror movie all time. The fact that it is black and white gives the movie a more eerie feel. There is no music throughout the whole movie except for the sound of the violin playing throughout the movie to calm down the monster, which I think makes it feel more realistic to the viewers. It had a big impact on people because it was a very scary movie in its day. And I remember watching this film with my dad when I was very young and being very scared of the monster. IT was interesting to learn that they cut a couple of scenes when they first showed the movie, that the director thought might make the audience uncomfortable or angry at the film.",Frankenstein
383,wbthockey,Iconic monster in an iconic movie,10,16 September 2020,"Despite this movie being in black and white, this is a very iconic movie and personally, one of my favorite movies in the horror genre. I loved how they brought in some comedic factors into the movies despite the horror and suspense for the movie. One of the comedic factors that I have always loved is Igor (Dr. Frankenstein's assistance) because he is always afraid of everything. A good example of this would be when he is grabbing the normal brain. When he goes to get it, he gets scared by the bouncing skeleton and then after he obtains the brain, he gets scared from a gong-like sound. Once he drops the brain, he goes for the Abnormal brain and acts like nothing happened.I still get that wholesome feeling when the monster meets the little girl, too. It does show that the monster does have a kind side, but he doesn't know his own strength either. I always start to tear up a little when the little girl drowns, too since she was just so innocent and then accidentally drowns because of the monster having so much fun.This film will always be a favorite of mine just like all the other old horror movies.",Frankenstein
384,colinpsquires,THE Monster,9,27 September 2020,"This film is the gold standard for classic horror and horror films in general. ""Frankenstein"" gifts audiences with one of the most original ideas of it's time and executes it on screen to near perfection. This collection of characters laid the blueprint for many monster flicks to follow. The dialogue of this film are legendary. There a good chance you've heard various lines from ""Frankenstein"" every Halloween, as a kid I knew a good chunk of these lines and who said them without ever seeing the film. That is a testament to how influential a masterful film can be. The iconic performances of Colin Clive and Boris Karloff are instrumental to this film. Clive is truly convincing as the medical genius Victor Frankenstein, who desires to push the boundaries of nature and create life in his own image. That idea alone carries some weight. Karloff delivers perhaps THE most important performance of a movie monster that there has ever been for the genre. As ""The Monster"" we get to see Dr. Frankenstein's creation that just doesn't seem to belong in this world and quickly develops dangerous tendencies as confusion and fear set in. ""The Monster"" is deadly yet innocent and garners sympathy from audiences as well as terror. ""Frankenstein"" is a generational film that should to be viewed by anyone who enjoys a good movie and is absolutely necessary for those in love with the horror genre.",Frankenstein

I think this was an almost perfect adaptation of the novel. I do have some questions though. I never understood why they kept him in the dark for the first few days and why didn't he kill Elizabeth when he was in her room. Fritz creeped me out and I can understand why Frankenstein killed him because he was always torturing him. Poor Frankenstein he never had a chance because he had an abnormal brain to begin with. I'm still also unsure of why Frankenstein was the way he was. Was he violent because he had the brain of a criminal? Or was he violent because he was tortured and that's what he learned? This movie is another reason why you should let the dead rest.",Frankenstein
386,hollywoodjohnny,The Classic Monster Film,7,19 October 2012,"Frankenstein (1931)I came in to viewing this movie having only seen Young Frankenstein (1974). This was totally different. Same concept, same story (kind of)...but much more of a fascinating picture. Everyone knows the story of Frankenstein (or at least should) so explaining the plot seems unnecessary. But the film itself - the directing, the cinematography, the acting, the overall mood - was incredible. The low key lighting and gloomy photography make this 1931 classic monster movie a truly eerie picture. It's not a scary movie by any means in todays standards, but back in the early 30s this clearly was a frightening film. And the choice of having no music in it, aside from the opening credits, gives it an even more eerie feeling. Incredible.If you haven't, see this movie. It's a classic in American cinema and the story of Frankenstein has stuck with the American culture ever since.",Frankenstein
387,miss_flowers,Somewhat Disappointing.,7,15 October 2012,"Frankenstein has got to be one of my favourite books of all time, so when I found out that I would have to watch the movie for a class, I was overjoyed. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed when watching the actual movie. While the film is good technically, with a very mobile camera, great balance and compositions and fair editing; as well as great actors (Even I will admit that Boris Karloff played the Frankenstein monster marvelously well), and very interesting character (Which, in my opinion, makes up for the so-so plot), it deviates so far from the original plot of the book that I was soured to the whole film. A great movie by itself, but it pales in comparison with the book, obviously. One really amazing technical/cinema graphic element that I will note is the long shot of the little girl's father walking into town with her body. Truly outstanding, if only for the technical elements",Frankenstein
388,joem294,Still a classic,7,14 March 2014,"As most of you already know or heard of this film ""Frankenstein"". In which a doctor creates life during a thunderstorm.This film is one of the first films of this story with sound and an actual monster that looks like the typical Frankenstein today.While the film even begins with dialogue of warning the audience this film can be scary. This gets the viewer prepared for this horror that will begin. One other quick detail to point out is the opening credits for the cast does not show a name for the monster; this is more to add to th scare in the viewers mind before the film begins.The film takes the viewer through the steps that the doctor has to go through to get an entire body built and prepared for life to be put into it. The film begins to take viewer away from the main story when we are forced to see the story from Elizabeth's eyes. She is the doctor's girlfriend/future wife and she takes the viewer through her struggles of worrying about her boyfriend, thinking he is not well and takes his professor to see if he is sick. With them coming to his lab creates tension for him while he is ready to create life.The famous scene of when Frankenstein creates life uses sounds of thunder and add light to make it seem like there really is thunder storm in the film. This is actually done very well for an early 1930's movie. This film holds mostly dark photography except the thunderstorm scene with a lot of light from it. The only close up shot used is for the monster and even though it is a close up only the face is seen and everything else is black.As the story progresses after the monster is given life Doctor Frankenstein begins to rest more with Elizabeth, but once news of the monster killing his professor and then a little girl he knows he has to stop the monster. These murders are added to show that the monster can kill, but with the little girls murder shows more of the monsters innocence and that he was not trying to killing her.This film is intended to be scary but anyone watching today won't think so since there are so many different makes of the movie today that it seems novice to the others. Still this film is a classic because it takes the actual book to life and is able to get the real story across.",Frankenstein
389,michel_broeders,"Well, we've warned you...",10,19 October 2018,"With these words we are introduced to Frankenstein, directed by James Whale, which was a hit upon its 1931 release with both critics and audiences. The film was followed by numerous sequels and has become arguably the most iconic horror film in history. The film raised the bar for all horror films that followed.Henry Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive, and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) piece together a human body, the parts collected from buried bodies and hanged criminals. The multi layered body is perfected with an abnormal brain. Frankenstein succeeds in creating life from death. The honors of portraying this monster goes to horror icon and Universal household name Boris Karloff.William Henry Pratt, better known by his stage name Boris Karloff, succeeds in frightening the audience while emotionally captivating them at the same time. Just as important as Karloff's interpretation of the monster is the brilliant make-up trickery of Jack Pierce. He designed the iconic head and hands for the famous monster, while James Whale gave the monster a shabby tramp suit with heavy, clumsy shoes. But it was Karloff who turned the monster from a scary bogey into a sympathetic, contact-craving blockhead, who inadvertently or rightly commits his misdeeds.The film has a number of theatrically staged moments that now belong to our cultural heritage: the ""creation"" that appeals to the imagination; the first appearance of the monster; the heart-rending scene with the girl who does not keep drifting; the attack on the young woman who is about to marry and the pursuit of the monster by farmers with torches.
This chase ends in an old windmill, where Frankenstein and his creation face each other in one of the first spectacular closing scenes from the horror genre.Ever since, good, bad, humorous and satirical horror movies have been made, but Frankenstein is and remains the rock on which the whole genre seems to rest.",Frankenstein

Strangulation, drowning, and fire. We have much more creative deaths in modern horror, stuff that actually keeps you up at night scared. On top of that, a lot of times, they don't actually show any of the dying! Isn't horror supposed to scare you? I wasn't scared by this at all!

I watched this movie when I was a kid and I didn't truly understand at the time everything such as what life and death was but I rather saw a monster who walked in a way that made me terrified. Now, I can comprehend the dark story of Victor Frankenstein and it only amplifies the horror in the story. His determination to bring someone back from the dead is uncanny. He is so determined that he goes after a brain (which is the most important piece of the equation to create his monster) by robbing one from a school. However, he grabbed the brain of a criminal. This makes his experiment go awry as once Frankenstein (played by Boris Karloff) comes to life, he turns into a giant monster who is the complete opposite of what Dr Frankenstein had in mind when he began the project.",Frankenstein

Doctor Frankenstein is a smart man that was raised with money in what seems to be a well respected family of the community. But by this point in his life however, he is stricken with a sense of god like power. Dr.Frankenstein feels that because he has found a way to create life, he is going to do just that no matter how wrong his friends and family around him feel his idea is. The monster is stitched together with parts of random deceased humans from the nearby graveyard and a psychopaths brain. The monsters life is sparked by a lightening storm and continues down the wrong path from there. From the beginning of his life you first feel that he truly is just that, a monster with no feelings at all. By the end your perception of him has changed completely where now you feel a sense of compassion for him. He never asked to be created much less left alone in a cold world with no guidance at all. He lived a tortured short life that was brought to an abrupt end by his greatest fear, fire.This film is nothing like a horror film of present day, but definitely pushed the limits of its time.

Most of my friends were annoyed that this was not the stereotypical horror movie most people expected. It's not gory, and it's not bloody, but it's bizarre enough to really make someone think. The beginning scene when Henry and his assistant are digging through the grave for dead bodies was fantastic to start with. The whole scene is heavily foreshadowing the terrible events towards the end. The whole movie gives off an eerie type of feel, everything dark, and the actors, especially Colin Clive are so passionate in their roles. The fact that no music was used during the film adds an extra element of eeriness. Every sound is heard, such as the cries of the angry mob of towns people, and the tortured shouts and grunts of the monster are excellent examples of this raw sound. Another brilliant scene was the electricity scene when the monster was first brought to life. The vivid electric currents and the sounds created a wonderfully powerful scene.",Frankenstein

James Whale's adaptation of a classic horror story is decent at best. The story is too vague and I feel as if the film is too short for the viewer to become fully engaged in the message. The 1934 sequel ""Bride of Frankenstein"" does a better job at showing that the ""Monster"" is not a criminal or a evil abomination but an misinterpreted creature who was cast into a world of arrogance via experiment. Many scenes in the movie are much to dark and I thought half the acting was lousy and they were trying to hard. Nothing is elaborated on enough and many details that get left out make the viewing experience more confusing than enjoyable. I feel as if a lot more detail should have been taken from the book because it would have helped create a more seamless story.

I am lost as to how this qualifies as a scary movie. Nothing about this film would make someone jump. In modern days this would be considered almost a high school quality film making. Even at a High School level this movie is a failure in my eyes.The over use of dim lighting made it near impossible at times to determine what was going on. The plot line was boring and very predictable with the exception of the little girl being thrown in the river. The girls death was the scariest part because it showed he did not know right from wrong and if he would kill a little girl who else knows what accidental mistakes he might make.Even with all my dislikes there is something to be said about a film that has lasted the test of time. So what redeeming qualities does this film hold? There is a scene where the girl that was killed is brought through town and the reaction can be seen on all the towns people as she passes and we can see their emotion going from happy partying to disgust and horror. This scene was brilliant and shot beautifully and is one of the most powerful and redeeming qualities in the movie.

397,pietoso,A Wondrous Creation,7,28 September 2020,"James Whale's Frankenstein is at the very least entertaining and worth a view, and a few standout elements serve to uplift the film and redeem it of certain mediocrities in casting and plot. It goes without saying that Boris Karloff is iconic and often inspired in his role as The Monster, generating a memorable and oddly disturbing presence with shambling movement and simian vocalizations. Colin Clive also deserves recognition for his performance as Henry Frankenstein, suitably unhinged and frequently brimming with bourgeois pretension. The rest of the cast unfortunately lacks the same originality and style, excepting perhaps Frederick Kerr as the Baron and Dwight Frye as the consistently bizarre and (unintentionally?) hilarious Fritz. The film is quickly populated with memorable and atmospheric scenes and sets that have clearly served as inspiration for innumerable films up to the modern day. Frankenstein's second half, however, sometimes feels disappointingly rote, especially in comparison to its previous heights, but shots of a bereaved father shambling through a reveling crowd, and later the Monster glaring at his Maker through a mechanical apparatus in the penultimate scene are as inspired as any other. Frankenstein may not entirely live up to its legacy, but it is without a doubt a fine example of Hollywood mythmaking, and understandably a legend in its time.",Frankenstein
398,mckennaniedhammer,Oh Frankenstein,7,15 February 2021,"This movie is definitely a classic that Halloween tales many knew as a child have spiraled off of. ""Frankenstein"" is one of the first few movies that really shed light into the horror movie world. With the classic dark and thundering set and the sights of bones and graveyards, it really sets the stage for a creepy and evil story. However, I do feel that the set could have been more realistic. It seems very obvious to me that the background is a back drop and the sounds are pretty generic.Overall, it did struggle to keep me entertained, where as some parts are stretched rather thin to keep the film going. I know it is one of the first in it's genre, but there are other horror films that were produced around the same time, that do a much better job at pulling the audience in and making the story believable.",Frankenstein
399,xjwx15,Frankenstein,8,9 October 2012,"I really liked the film Frankenstein. I thought it carried a lot of emotions throughout the movie. Overall I felt sadness for the monster and thought that he was the one who actually got treated unfairly. He didn't mean to hurt anyone but was looked at as a horrible creature, but he actually was just like a child who needed to be taught and you can see that very clearly in the scene with the little girl. I thought the camera angles they used were pretty cool also. There were a lot of scenes shot from either the top or bottom corners and I thought that was neat. I thought the lighting and sounds were done well also. I would recommend this movie to anyone, I thought it was very well made.",Frankenstein
400,v-doody,Frankenstein (1931),10,12 March 2014,"Horror films? Count me in. A horror film about a misunderstood monster? Absolutely count me in. ""Frankenstein"" (1931) is the ultimate classic Hollywood horror story. Now, I'll be honest. Watching ""Frankenstein"" in 2014 is extremely different from what it would be like if I had watched it in 1931. Growing up in a generation of horror films where every monster is your worst nightmare because special effects crews have the ability to digitally make that happen, the monster from ""Frankenstein"" is nowhere near frightening. But to think back to 1931, I'm sure ""Frankenstein"" was one of the most horrifying films ever created.In terms of plot: Mad scientist creates monster, mad scientist realizes he made a mistake so he treats his monster like dirt, the monster has the mental equivalency to that of a small child so he doesn't understand his actions and starts throwing kids into rivers...you know, the usual.Honestly the best aspect of this film, is that it's so not scary (at least in the horror sense). Don't get me wrong, it is scary (in an emotionally ""i can't believe i can relate to a classic horror film monster"" kind of way) but it's not frightening in the sense that you'll end up jumping out of your seats (unless seeing people gang up on someone different than them is physically frightening to you in which case, carry on with the screaming.)Personally I like that in a modern day setting, this film is rather cheesy. It's what makes it so great. You know, the black and white color, the grunting monster, the townspeople with their pitchforks, the creaky/creepy background sounds (i.e. thunder and lightning) all of that is what makes ""Frankenstein"" such a classic. And not just any horror classic but THE horror classic.",Frankenstein
401,Dimitrios0415,A one of a kind Monster Movie,8,11 February 2015,"A classic example of what a horror film should look up to being when it is conceptualized. When somebody takes the time to build up such a great symphony of work, this is the result. An excellent example of how to inspire things once you get started. An excellent work of art from the universal film crew, working on a below average budget, managed to create something that would set the trend for the monster film for ages to come. Whether the films happen to be made by Universal or not. I will refrain from the use of specifics, to prevent as much ruining of the movie as possible. A great example of how a film should be designed in general when going for an eerie feel. Dark lighting, tons and tons of dimly lit scenes. All being used to the advantage of the cinematographer. No scene really does feel empty in this movie, when you take the time to observe each and every scene, every angle and shot has a bit of purpose. All to set the mood and get across the actors emotions. Sometimes though some of the characters over embellish their actors emotions, making them seem more or less to silly for the subject matter at hand. Overall a must watch.",Frankenstein
402,tophkissane,Great classic horror,7,12 May 2016,"I really enjoyed this early horror movie. It was just simple and creepy, its not like modern horror that relies on shocks, it was just the movement of the camera and the lighting that made it feel like a horror film. I was surprised how humanized he is, in modern depictions I haven't really seen that side. My favorite scene was the he with the little girl, and the sudden snapping was kind of fun. The doctor was fun and properly crazy for the role he was playing. There's a reason hes alive is such an iconic line and he really kills it. I would like to watch the sequels sometime to continue to see the monster more humanized. I would definitely encourage you watch this if you haven't because it sets the standard for the creepy horror that I feel is the best kind of horror.",Frankenstein
403,robotman-2,"A Film, Not a Book",10,3 October 2000,"After a century of film-making, there is still such a vast and all-consuming ignorance of what films in general, and FRANKENSTEIN in particular, are supposed to do. Source material, fromMary Shelley's novel of the same title, sub-heading ""Modern Prometheus"", is an overheated gothic tale exploring a topic that was very prominent at the turn of the century: the morality of Science. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the protagonist, creates artificial life in his laboratory, and witnesses that life gather its own intelligence. Eventually, the life-form demands more, haunting Frankenstein to his end.The book is literature, a time-piece. The film FRANKENSTEIN is also a time-piece, but the book has no bearing on the film. This is a film about a creature, the Monster played by Boris Karloff, and the great Jack Pierce make-up which is an icon of American culture. The Monster is inarticulate, confused, and dangerous. The story concerns the Monster's attempt to understand anything around it: the Monster has been given electric life by von Frankenstein, but it has no understanding, and no time to understand before its immense strength commits the murders that will condemn it.The book is a reaction to intellectual exploration of life and death, and the consequences of assuming the role of ""God"". The film is about the loneliness and despair of a freakish creation trying to understand the simpliest, but most powerful, human emotions, and being unable to do so. The movie is not the book, thankfully, but is a jarring introduction to cinematic story-telling that is still powerful and evocative, while the book remains an excellent work hampered by the literary conventions of its time.",Frankenstein
404,jaynashvil,Still the standard,10,8 March 2001,"Few will disagree that ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is in so many ways a better picture than the original.  But since they both involve the same director and primary cast, I consider them as two parts of the same movie.I have no complaints at all about ""Bride"".  It certainly benefits from a more deeply thought-out script and an adequately bankrolled sense of delight in the macabre. The unarguable ""improvements"" in the sequel are often, for me, the very things that makes the original so special.The major technical improvements  during the short years between the original and sequel have made ""Frankenstein"" seem perhaps older than it is. The lack of a score and less showy camerawork give it almost a documentary quality, not unlike the famous Hindenberg newsreel footage. ""Frankenstein"" feels like this is an actual record of exactly how it looked and felt the day Dr. Frankenstein did his evil deed!I'm not saying that ""Frankenstein"" seems primitive in a bad way--unlike '31's ""Dracula"" with it's ""point the camera at the stage because we can't move the camera"" lack of technique. The oldness adds to it's greatness. The graininess of the picture, the shrill sound effects and James Whale's unusual cutting style of deliberate jump-cuts (especially in the scene when the Creature makes his big entrance and, moments later, reaches longingly for the sunlight)contribute to the realness of the story and the film.It gave me nightmares as a kid; only now, I know why.",Frankenstein

406,violencegang,"Happy 75th, Frankie!",10,23 February 2006,"As I'm sure fans of this movie are aware, 2006 marks the 75th anniversary of the release of this timeless classic. I'm not sure of the exact release date (I'm pretty sure it was sometime in November 1931), but it's a testament to the film's quality that it's still held in such high regard seven and a half decades after its initial release. I wasn't born until 1979 and didn't see the movie until 1997, but it still blew me away. I've seen it dozens of times since, and I never get bored with it.What makes this film so good? It's not particularly scary to a modern audience, but it still possesses a charm that belies its age, and while many regard Bride of Frankenstein as superior, you can't have a sequel without the original, can you? The thing about Frankenstein is that, unlike the 1931 Dracula, which is rather static and stagy, both technically and in terms of acting (I'm surprised that Universal were able to reuse so many of the sets in later productions, given that Bela Lugosi, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye all seem intent on not just chewing the scenery, but devouring it), Frankenstein possesses remarkable depth and subtlety.Volumes have been written about Boris Karloff's performance as the monster, and it is truly mesmerising, but credit must also go to the remarkable supporting cast, and foremost among these is Colin Clive (who was actually the star of the film, and not the then-unknown Karloff). Clive gives a superb performance as Henry Frankenstein, illustrating the character's obsessive side without ever losing touch with his essential humanity. Clive was sadly a real-life Jekyll and Hyde (he was an alcoholic) and in Frankenstein he reconciles the two conflicting aspects of the doctor's personality perfectly.Dwight Frye as Frankenstein's assistant Fritz is also excellent, portraying the odd little hunchback with just the right sinister touch. Frye had played another oddity, Renfield, in Dracula, and he once again balances the differing sides of his character well, going from fear of the monster to tormenting him sadistically (which costs him dear eventually).Edward Van Sloan's Doctor Waldman may not be as entertaining as Ernest Thesiger's wonderfully camp Doctor Praetorius in Bride, but he leads the proceedings an air of authority, his rational approach providing a good counterbalance to Frankenstein's madness. John Boles and Mae Clarke as Victor Moritz and Elizabeth are not as showy, and Boles is rather bland (note that the character did not reappear in Bride) but they are fairly likable and inoffensive. Frederick Kerr gives a wonderfully blustering performance as Henry's father and Lionel Belmore is good as the burgomaster (his argument with Kerr is quite amusing), but the real highlight is of course Karloff as the monster.Whereas later Frankenstein monsters had a tendency to be somewhat robotic (which is why Karloff stop playing the character after Son of Frankenstein), Karloff's performance is remarkable for the humanity he invests in the character, something that never disappears under Jack Pierce's iconic makeup job. The important point is that Karloff plays the creature as an innocent, more sinned against than sinning. Although the monster does kill and kidnap, he does so not out of a sense of malice, but rather because he lacks the intelligence to do any better (his brain is after all a criminal one). Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the scene with Marilyn Harris' Little Maria; the way Karloff plays the monster's changing moods, from happy innocent to horrified when he realises the girl does not float like the flowers, is unforgettable.Frankenstein is memorable not only for its acting, but also its technical and visual aspects. The set design is superb, from the spooky tower where Frankenstein conducts his experiments with its Kenneth Strickfaden-designed machines, full of sound and fury, to the burning windmill at the end, but the real credit has to go to director James Whale, who took over a project rejected by Bela Lugosi and featuring a mediocre script and turned it into one of the greatest movies of all time. The original script had the monster as nothing more than a savage beast (which is why Lugosi turned it down), but under Whale it was extensively reworked, with the pathos and humanity that have made it a classic added. Although Frankenstein was not the first Universal horror movie, without it there wouldn't be the term Universal Horror, just a stagy vampire movie starring a rather hammy Hungarian. Because Frankenstein confirmed that audiences had a taste for this type of movie, it opened the floodgates for virtually every other scary movie made since 1931. While this may be a mixed blessing, at least we have this brilliant movie and that makes up for all the dross in the world.",Frankenstein
407,rivardoman,Still Alive!,9,19 February 2014,"James Whale's Frankenstein 1931 is a true masterpiece. The iconic story of a mad scientist bent on constructing human life never gets old! The film is a great example of how the movies began to mature as popular techniques were developed. The way the camera bounces around right before Dr. Frankenstein brings his monster to life builds suspense in a great way. All leading up to that famous line, ""IT'S ALIVE!"". Universal goes all out on this one. The creepy lighthouse, bubbling test tubes and zapping electric coils bring in the right ambiance. Also, horribly violent for its time. I have to admit I love it. They had to cut some material upon the original release. I'm happy it was saved to be restored at a later date. Creativity shouldn't be held back by some censorship agency!

The acting was great and very believable. My favorite characters were the Frankenstein and the scientists father, they provided a good balance of horror and humor. The special features were minimal yet played a crucial role in the verisimilitude. The plot again was ehhh okay, probably due to the fact that this is a much older movie and movies have copied the style and basic plot idea. This movie/book idea was of course original back when it was created. If I was from that era I probably would've enjoyed it more. The movie teaches a couple good morals, so cannot hate too much.

It wasn't realistic or anything and Ill admit i did not think i was going to like it as much as i did. First of all it was a good length of a movie i thought, It wasn't long at all but it also wasn't too short. Until recently i didn t think black and white movies were fun to watch. Ill admit that over the past few weeks I've come to respect the black and white movies. Certain movies I've realized need to be in black and white and this is one of them i feel. What i mean by that is, that the way this movie looks in black and white is perfect for the story. Its a dark and scary tale and the whole look of the image including its shadows and lighting with the black white picture makes it kind of spooky. This movie was a huge part in horror movies history and i am very glad i got to experience watching this movie and i recommend it to anyone.

It utilizes a bigger contrast between light and dark to create an atmosphere as many films from this era do. It shows a kind of hopelessness. It had a very profound meaning behind it as well. This is the idea that is was the doctor who created the monster, that was in fact the true monster. The acting on the part of Frankenstein's monster seemed to convey a kind of cluelessness that created a sense of empathy, even when he was causing mayhem. It seemed he didn't really know what he was doing and seemed terrified as to why he couldn't make sense of his surroundings. The doctor himself gave off a sense of lust for power, and for knowledge. He seems to have a nihilistic sort of world view where truth and facts are the only things of any importance.

As the audience, you feel sorry for him because he just wants to try to communicate and have an understanding of this new life but everyone that sees him is frightened by him. Unfortunately, everyone feels the need to destroy him because he is a menace, and when he is destroyed it is bittersweet for the doctor but unfortunately no one is supposed to play the ""higher power"" but himself.I was expecting a little more horror or suspense to this movie but was surprised and impressed by the twist to this story.

There's one shot which I found rather weird: When we first see the monster, they do a close up of his face twice, as if we didn't get all the details the first time. Why do we need to zoom in on his forehead twice? The scene where the monster plays with the girl is rather heartwarming...until he throws her into the lake. The last shot of the monster has him flailing around trapped in a burning windmill, an odd shot. We're supposed to assume he's dead.

Upset that their game of throwing flowers is over because there is none left to be thrown, the monster unknowingly throws the girl in the water where she subsequently drowns. The lack of gore was refreshing however. Director James Whale did a great job of setting the tone of the movie. I was impressed by the sets. The mill was believable at this time period given the lack or technology. I would have liked to see a little more detail shown towards Dr. Frankenstein. It seemed pretty odd that the film didn't mention towards the end that it was he who set the town up for terror, although not his intentions.

""Frankenstein"" created by Universal, riding high on their wave of profit from ""Dracula"" (1931), is one of the greats when it comes to monster movies in cinema. It shows the best intentions of man going awry due to science going too far. It steps into the realm of mans inner desire and feelings of a god complex, with unforeseen and terrifying circumstances. The photography within the movie is brilliant with dim footage and the manipulation of shadows throughout creating an overarching sense of dread, fear, and suspense. My favorite example is the night scene with the torches, that to me was truly a magnificent scene. The misunderstood monster is a character that i was rooting for but my perspective consistently shifted from supporting Dr. Frankenstein to supporting his creation.

He is a tortured soul, trapped in a grotesque body, and commanded by strange people.  When he does do harm to others, it is mostly out of naivete or fear.  This is what makes the final scene in the windmill so heart-wrenching.  The monster is surrounded by that which fears most.  Karloff's expression of child-like terror and helplessness is truly unforgettable.  Frankenstein is also a quickly paced movie and clocks at a brisk 71 minutes. The material is explored throughly, and there is nary a dull moment in the film.  The characters, if not exceedingly well-developed, are interesting and portrayed realistically.

Stunning moments such as the monster mistakenly throwing the little girl into the water, and the doctor shouting ""Now I know what it feels like to BE God!"" were neutered from it, and that is more frightening to me than any moment within the film. Desensitization and the natural evolution of film technology and experience has made it so that the modern viewer might take old classic horrors and dismiss then at a glance, assuming they failed in their mission to horrify and awe. However, the world still watches Frankenstein not for its ""scare value,"" but for the powerful cinematography, writing, and acting that bring it far beyond its listed horror genre.

426,joung37,The role that got Boris Karloff famous.,10,18 September 2010,"One day when I was on the internet and was looking at some horror movies on Google, I spotted this great title. Then when I saw the 75th Anniversiry Edition DVD in a store, I just knew I had to have this marvelous movie. I got to say it was well worth my time, because the performances were superb- especially the famous line ""It's Alive! It's Alive!"". At first the director, James Whale, didn't want to direct this, because he thought it would be a joke. But then he thought of the possibilities of Frankenstien- creating something that audience had never seen on the big-screen. While the movie is no longer scary and frightening, because the horror in it is what is in G-rated pictures on Television today, it still is great, because it seems more like a drama. Boris Karloff's performance is what really makes this film worth watching, because you just feel sorry for him and makes you want to watch this film again and again. If you have never seen this movie, check it out as soon as possible, it's well worth the time.",Frankenstein
427,j-maxon1,Frankenstein(1931),8,14 March 2011,"What an incredible movie! Frankenstein is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and so matter how many times the story is retold or how much money and technology Hollywood throws at it they will never out do the original.The character of ""The Monster"", or ""The Creature"", or ""Frankensteins Monster""(Karloff) or whatever you choose to call it is a dark, disturbing, and intimidating being but almost from the time it is re-animated you feel sorry for it because it seems to be confused. Even though the Monster has no lines in the movie you can tell it is struggling internally.The darkness and camera motion are what really make this movie creepy. When you add this with the sound effects, costume and set design, and the make-up you have everything need to make movie perfection. As I said James Whale made this movie right the first time and any attempt to out do it is futile!",Frankenstein
428,bigcahs93,"one of the best, and most important, horror movies you'll ever see",10,10 February 2013,"Frankenstein (1931) is a monster movie... well you probably know what its about already. Personally, I've never really been a big horror fan (with the exception of Evil Dead, The Shining, and John Carpenters 'The Thing') but Frankenstein swept me off my feet. The most glaring praise i can give to it is the absence of a soundtrack. Most movies, especially horror movies, can't work without a good soundtrack (would Star Wars be even half as good without John Williams?) yet Frankenstein doesn't need it. What makes the movie scary, in terms of form, is the camera angles. The movie is very effectively edited and uses reaction shoots perfectly. The best example of this is tracking shoot of the man from the woods walking through the town with his daughter and peoples reaction to them. However, this movie excels in its narrative. It boils down to a struggle with something that has morphed into something out of ones control. This is simple narrative, but it is one of the most influential narratives in all of cinema. The struggle between Dr. Frankenstein and The Monster is the same we see between David and HAL-9000, or between Deckard and the Replicant's. Its a great representation of the internal struggle of man, and its just another reason why this movie is so great. 10/10",Frankenstein
429,j-portnoy,Not your typical horror film,6,28 September 2020,"This classic has its place in film history, but both times I've watched it (separated by many years), I've struggled to stay interested. There are a couple of iconic moments, including the fast cut to tight shots on Boris Karloff as we first see Frankenstein's monster. However, after some great initial scenes in the graveyard, the direction by James Whale often takes us away from scenes of interest or tension, and doesn't dive deeply enough into the darkness of 'playing god'. Instead we get silliness, such as the assistant getting the jar marked 'Abnormal Brain'. I think the movie for its time was a great basis for horror films to come, but it isn't your typical scary or gore film. Overall, I would still say to watch the film as is interesting to see the first Frankenstein ever made and how they depict the monster. I rate it a 6 out of 10.",Frankenstein
430,hypathio7,Karloff's star making role is still alive!,9,23 September 2014,"This is not a close adaptation of Mary Shelley's book, but James Whale's film has become more culturally iconic than the book. Unlike some of the other Universal monster movies this one did not strike me as campy. It is full of old-time-y acting perhaps, but that is OK with me. Mae Clarke as Elizabeth, Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé, did a good job in the romantic lead. The character of Victor, Elizabeth's other male friend, is pretty useless hanging around except for providing a little dialog. Edward Van Sloan (Van Helsing in Dracula) as Dr. Waldman is quite dull. Frankenstein's father is an old fuddy-duddy whose English accent really seems out of place in the generic German town where this story is set. Lionel Belmore is the Burgomaster, a small part, but he will pop up again in this series. Dwight Frye, fresh off of his role in Dracula, plays Dr. Frankenstein's humpback assistant Fritz. There is no Igor in this original movie. Colin Clive shows Frankenstein in mad scientist mode and romantic mode and is much better than I expected him to be from clips I had seen. Boris Karloff has a star making turn in this classic! It is amazing the depth he is able to portray in that makeup and only through grunts.The Gothic sets and movement of the cameras are impressive. The laboratory established the look of mad scientists' lairs for decades. James Whale's feeling on the pulse of this franchise made it the best of Universal's classic monsters. Many people may think they know this movie without having seen it from start to finish, but it offers surprises to those who really look. It is still alive!",Frankenstein
431,trahwerdna,Frankenstein: review,8,10 May 2010,"Frankenstein is a great film with an underlying theme. This film presents a peculiar scenario of what it's like to be different. Dr. Frankenstein portrays the perfect ""evil genius"" character whose genius is only surpassed by his madness and whose fall is a product of his insanity. This film is an early attempt, and warning to the public, to show the tragedy of creating artificial life. Dr. Frankenstein's famous quote ""Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!"" is perfect expression of the dark side of science. On the other hand, this film is a loner movie. The monster drifts through the landscape searching for his own meaning despite his obvious handicap. This theme speaks to many of us who know what its like to feel completely alone in the world.",Frankenstein
432,knoll360,A very excellent film but a bad adaptation,8,26 February 2011,"Even though this film varies drastically from its source material (Frankenstein (Book, 1818)) it still manages to be both frightening and entertaining. The movie follows Henry Frankenstein who is engaged to a girl named Elizabeth. He leaves his fiancée for four months to work on an experiment with his assistant Fritz. His experiment is to revive a dead corpse but since he is unable to find a perfectly healthy human corpse (they had to have had something wrong with them if they died after all) he ends up grave digging and putting all of the pieces together to create ""The Monster"". When he succeeds in giving it life the Monster manages to escape and cause trouble throughout the entire countryside, killing at will. Will anyone be able to stop the monster? So basically the story is very good although it hardly follows the novel at all, even changing the main characters name from Victor to Henry (yet they named a minor character Victor to add to the confusion). The Monster's intelligence is also drastically brought down to the point where he can't even speak. The main loss though is the fact that the good guy/bad guy relationship is much more black and white. In the original novel it was open to interpretation but here the Monster is clearly bad with Henry being good. So the story is very entertaining, but also a missed opportunity.When it comes to the acting in this film I truly feel that all of the actors did a great job in their roles. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein and really pulls off the mad scientist vibe really well. Then there is Mae Clarke who plays Elizabeth but the script doesn't give her very much room as it makes her out as the damsel in distress. Keeping that in mind though she pulls it off well. And next up is Dwight Frye as Fritz, often incorrectly called Igor by viewers. Frye is great as the crazy and stupid hunchbacked character. Most importantly we have Boris Karloff in the film that raised him into star dome. Even though he is covered in makeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film. He really helps the audience sympathize with his character but at the same time manages to be the angry evil monster. So overall there is some great acting here.All of the makeup and special effects are excellent here with some realistic looking wounds and decomposition on the corpse of the Monster. In addition there are some great sets in the film which truly set the mood with the exception of the final scenes where the Monster is being chased on a mountain which looks somewhat fake. And as for the musical score it complements the picture tremendously. Frankenstein is a very technically sound film overall.As a classic of the horror genre at the time and one of the most famous monster movies ever made I was slightly disappointed with the film. I am a huge fan of the original novel and was disappointed that so few elements transferred over to the movie but nevertheless it is still an excellent monster movie and one that is worth your time. It is very good technically with excellent special effects, sets, and music plus it has some great acting especially from Boris Karloff as the Monster. So give this film a try if you have any interest whatsoever in monster movies, horror, or Frankenstein. But don't expect it to be anything like the book. Score: 8/10",Frankenstein
433,ilvatz,Zapped me like a lightning bolt!,9,29 February 2012,"Simply amazing are the only words I can use to describe how masterfully this film was put together. The mise-de-scene of this movie is so dark and foreboding and truly leaves a very good impression of this film on the viewer.The acting alone makes this film worth watching. The crazed obsession of Dr. Frankenstein with completing his experiment was very well reflected through his wild appearance when he gets excited about it.The monster itself, despite having no speaking lines had some amazing acting going on. Without using a single word he perfectly reflected the confusion and fright of being brought back from the dead. A creature, not inherently evil, but drawn to acts of unknowing wickedness by the way it was treated by its creator and its own ignorance of the ways of interaction is perfectly shown in this film.The scene at the end where the monster is trapped on top of the tower that they have just set on fire is amazing because you can see the confusion and fright that the monster is feeling because it doesn't know that its even done anything wrong and doesn't understand why it's being hunted down.Excellent movie, I would recommend it to anyone.",Frankenstein
434,WildestDreams,Impressions of a horror obsessor,9,23 April 2017,"Fast-paced and engaging. Gothic atmosphere is immersive.

But I do need to explain how impressive this is: Even with fewer tools at hand to obscure the fiction of a motion picture, I could not outsmart this movie.

Boris Karloff's portrayal of the monster is top notch and I was greatly impressed with the makeup and costume design in the film. The film, however, isn't without its quirks. Certain parts, I felt were so dark that it was difficult to identify what is going on in the particular scene. Another scene that just felt clunky to me was the assumed death of the monster at the end. The fire made everything much darker, so it was very difficult to fully understand, and the ending just didn't feel very satisfying to me. One scene that stunned me was when the monster drowned the girl after they were playing by the river. Overall, this movie was well put together for the most part and would be an inspiration for horror movies to come.",Frankenstein

As far as a film goes, it's certainly respectable. The problem for me is that I thought it was boring. It didn't meet up to the hype, and not just the overall hype of it being ""Frankenstein"". In the very beginning of the film a man hyped the movie up before it even started, saying that it might even horrify those who watch it. With only one scene involving the girl, the movie was hardly horrifying, and even that scene was lackluster compared to any movie under the ""Horror"" genre. Five out of ten for being well made, but I wouldn't give it any more simply because it bored me.",Frankenstein

The suspense and horror that Karloff brought to his movies was on full display in this one. This is by far the best screen adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel.

438,Dezcaughtit88,Frankenstein Review,8,10 February 2016,"While this isn't the most convincing monster film I've ever seen, seeing how I'm a more modern observer. But the film has a very huge significance to not only the horror genre but movies in general. This film pushed the boundaries on the content that can be viewed in theaters and helped to spark a fascination with horror films amongst the public. With that being said overall the movie is very well filmed with some not so spectacular acting, but it didn't take away from the overall experience. Seeing how it is a horror film it is expected to have exaggerated acting and it works very well in this case. The world in the film is outrageous, people can dig up dead bodies and get away with raising the dead, it already appears to be a larger than life world so the hyperbolized acting works. The camera work and special effects in this movie is very impressive for the time. They take advantage of lighting to portray evil and fearful emotions as well as hopeful and happy emotions. It helps the viewer to get into the mind of the monster and have a deeper understanding of who he is. This film is a classic film that transcends time with it's cultural and cinematic significance.",Frankenstein
439,stuthehistoryguy,THE masterpiece of the Horror genre.,10,30 August 1999,"_Frankenstein_ represents a synthesis of great work.  Whale and Webling wisely decided to avoid the epic stature of Shelley's book.  Instead, they created a tight story with some of the most memorable scenes in film history.  Cinematographer Karl Freund borrows from his German Expressionist roots in using shadow to create a foreboding atmosphere.  Special effects artist Kenneth Strickfaden and makeup genius Jack Pierce became legends for their work on Frankenstein's laboratory and the creature's appearance, both of which have ascended to archetypal stature in the human consciousness. Perhaps the greatest credit, however, belongs to Boris Karloff, whose pantomime of the monster evokes tremendous sympathy even as it scares us. _Frankenstein_ is a true classic in a field of pale imitators.",Frankenstein
440,heisalexh,Only the Sequel is better,10,6 April 2010,"Frankenstein(1931) is a film which has stood the test of time. Far better than other films of it's generation, there is probably no film better than this to sit down with, and spend a rainy, thundering evening eating chips and drinking tea. Even though few people alive today can actually claim this movie is nostalgic and be sincere, even a first-time viewer can watch and feel the nostalgia. The old watch tower set is among the most famous towers seen in any movie, and by far the most memorable. Not many people mention it, but I think Colin Clive had the perfect voice for the role of Henry Frankenstein. Though it seems impossible, the film could have looked quite different with Bela Lugosi to be the first choice to play the monster, but refused due to the lack of dialogue. That mistake would prove disastrous for his career. Karloff was given a screen-test, and created the monster that we all remember today. It was this interpretation of the Frankenstein Monster, and this make-up design by Jack Pierce that have inspired the thousands of knock-offs we have all seen. This is the definitive version of Frankenstein. No October will be complete without a viewing of this work of art of a film. The beautiful back rounds (though obviously fake) give the film it's feel, and for some reason, it all seems part of the nostalgia.We all know the story, but in case you don't this is a review. We begin with Edward Van Sloan introducing us to the film, warning us that it may ""shock"" us. From there, we see Henry Frankenstein and his hunchback assistant Fritz peering into a graveyard, waiting for a funeral to end, opening up an opportunity to exhume dead bodies for their experiments. The plan to create a man in Henry's image goes awry when Fritz steals an abnormal, criminal brain, which is of course inserted into the monster. All this, right before Henry Frankenstein is to be married. From there on the film gets more exciting, but I won't reveal it for the few who have yet to see it. It is somewhat dated by today's standards, but the film is far superior to the trash fest horror films we see now days such as Saw, Ghost Ship, and many others.I recommend this back-to-back with it's surprisingly superior sequel, Bride of Frankenstein.",Frankenstein
441,Hendy44,Great movie. Excellent ending.,6,9 February 2016,I enjoyed this movie greatly! i believe that it was very suspenseful for the time period and the technology that was at the fingertips of these producers. it was actually quite a scary movie from the audio that was used for certain scenes to the cast of characters. Especially the man who played as Frankenstein. it is truly an American iconic horror movie. however the movie did seem short and the way the light was it did not seem that you (the viewer) could not tell weather it was daytime or nighttime which was a confusing point for me in the movie but all in all i did enjoy the movie and im exited to watch the sequel to this movie.,Frankenstein
442,awindecker,Week 3 History of Cinema Review,7,8 February 2021,"This film and the book it is based off of are iconic within the horror genre. I had never seen this film but by now, going into this film I was aware of the common analysis regarding Frankenstein's monster. Most viewers believe the monster was ""misunderstood"". And after watching this film I can come to the same conclusion. This is proved on how the monster reacts to different treatment. When he is met with violence and hostility, he returns that behavior. However, when he met the young girl Maria, she showed him kindness and you could see the monster soften. When he threw Maria in the lake I don't believe he knew what his action would lead to, he just thought she would float like the flowers. I believe the genuine monster here is Henry Frankenstein himself. Harvesting dead bodies and performing dangerous experiments on them. He also could not handle his creation with led to multiple deaths. Of course this film was released in the 1930's and the ""horror"" only stretched to certain bounds, if you compared this film to a horror movie now the horror elements and how scary the movie is would look quite different. With that being said I found this film to be more depressing than anything. Taking into consideration what I have previously stated, there was a lot of death in this movie that could have been avoided if the ""human"" characters did not behave so hostile.",Frankenstein
443,sjcal75,One Of The Original Horror Greats!,7,31 October 2005,"Frankenstein from 1931 is definitely one of the great original horror films. Though not exactly considered to be real scary by today's standards, it was probably the first talkie to be considered a very scary picture during the time of The Great Depression.Even though movies didn't have soundtracks back in the early '30's, this was still a well made film, with very fabulous acting. Boris Karloff was and will always be the definitive Frankenstein Monster. It's a shame he only portrayed the monster in only 3 films. Colin Clive's is truly sensational as the brilliant, but obviously obsessed scientist Dr. Frankenstein. Another standout actor that we have is Edward Van Sloan, who portrayed Van Helsing in Dracula which came out the same year as Frankenstein. Here here also plays a scientist who was Henry's mentor at one time. However, Dr Waldman would not defeat the Frankenstein monster as he did with Dracula. He unfortunately would be one of the monster's victims. The main story revolves around Dr. Frankenstein's determination to create a human being from dead corpses, but for good causes. However, while constructing his new creation he is completely unaware that the brain he inserted is a criminal brain that his deformed assistant Fritz seemed to take by mistake. Fritz is portrayed by character actor Dwight Frye who like Van Sloan, also appeared in Dracula. Once the doctor realizes his creation is a monstrous fiend he asks his mentor to try and destroy it. However, the monster murders him and then escapes the laboratory and starts to run amok around the village.After his escape we come upon perhaps the most famous of the Frankenstein scenes where the monster comes across a little girl tossing flower petals in the lake, and watching them float. The monsterthinking she will float, too decides to throw her in the lake, but has no idea that she drowns to death. The whole village which includes Henry decides to form a mob to hunt down the creature before he kills more innocent people. Then we come to the climax where it's creator vs. creation, as the doctor meets the monster face to face. The monster will carry the unfortunate scientist into a windmill pursued by the entire village. Henry attempting to escape the clutches of his creation, is thrown from the top of the windmill and almost meets his demise. Then all of the angry villagers burn down the mill with their torches assuming they actually destroyed him. However, long before Michael, Jason, and Freddy were even thought of Frankenstein is probably the first horror anit-hero the audience realizes doesn't die very easy. We will eventually discover that in the Bride of Frankenstein.",Frankenstein
444,patti-m,It was good but...,6,18 March 2013,"Frankenstein is one of the most famous movie monster movies ever and although it was an O.K. movie, it left me wanting more. Perhaps because the movie is so notorious, I was expecting something super scary with many twists and turns but unfortunately it isn't very frightening and the plot is pretty straight forward. Maybe I completely missed the point and there was a much deeper meaning but the story and the characters all felt very shallow. The protagonist in the film, Dr. Henry Frankenstein, is barely even likable. I was actually rooting for the monster to win in the end because I was so unimpressed by Dr. Frankenstein's character. The acting was so-so but Boris Karloff was definitely the stand out. Even though the story could have been better there were certainly many wonderful things about this film. For one, the costume, makeup and set design are absolutely fantastic. The laboratory in the castle is extremely elaborate with many huge metal machines and lots of electric effects. The Monster makeup is great but I think they could have maybe made him a bit scarier. Overall the movie was good but I was definitely expecting something amazing.",Frankenstein

I did really enjoy the camera work, and the cool props used in the lab scene with the sparks flying everywhere. I liked the scene as the camera follows the man as he carries the little girl's lifeless body through the town and one by one the smiling citizens turn in horror.

446,barrosjared,"It's alive, and a enduring classic",10,3 March 2017,"Frankenstein, (though not the very first adaptation), is one of the best re-imagining of the classic horror novel by the late Mary Shelly. The film's leading portrayal is the Frankenstein Monster (Boris Karloff), the body language expressed by Karloff makes you feel sympathetic for the creature. The character of Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), the madman that creates the monster is relentless in his pursuit to finish the creature even when it means stealing brains from the university. The hunchback Friz (Dwight Frye), gets afraid of a skeleton while attempting to steal the normal human brain, the jar drops to the floor causing Friz to pick the abnormal one instead. The film does have a few extra characters that are close to Frankenstein, but they are somewhat bland and forgettable. Dr Waldman is decent enough, but is killed early on, which was a little predictable. The film has many great moments that make you feel sympathetic for the creation. Despite having the brain of a criminal, the monster does have good intentions. I don't like the way that in the movie, Henry isn't horrified at his creation and feels like a mean person.

A true horror film with no filler. Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein is just what I had imagined his character to feel like. For a film of the early stages of sound, all is clear in that regard.

Although technology and effects were not up to today's standards, the atmosphere and props were convincing. Acting was well read if not a little too theatrical. Coming into a new era of ""talkies"", it is understandable that the cast made sure that the audience clearly understood how they felt through their actions throughout the film.

Like most people, I don't like it when movies based on books are nothing like the book, but this is FAR from that. This doesn't even have the same characters! (I mean it does, but the characters don't have the right names, they are switched around). And in this movie, the characters aren't likable! Dr. Frankenstein is just a nut-ball mad scientist who robs graves. In the book, he was an interesting man who had a likable personality. I do dislike this movie for being nothing at all, AT ALL like the book, But its still a great movie! It has approved some of the things from the book (While the book is still far superior) like for example, in the book, Dr. Frankenstein's goal was to create life. Which he succeeds at doing completely! But he doesn't care that it was a mission success, he regrets doing it JUST BECAUSE its ugly. Thats it! While in the movie, he doesn't really care if its ugly or not, hes just happy that its alive. So yeah, even though I hate that its nothing like the book, its still a great movie.

On Second thought it was an good movie in a bad genre. Many scenes such as the windmill burning to the ground are really beautiful because they are this ray of light that shines through a movie filled with darkness and death. the significance of scenes being taken out of this is the most interesting part seeing as this is an early code ear movie and is an example of the code being enforced.

Looking at it now, having seen the modern cinematography and CGI effects capable with our technology, we lose some of what the original audiences felt at seeing Boris Karloff as the monster for the first time. I think the movie is unique, especially in the horror genre, for not having a clear protagonist and antagonist, though I'm sure the early audiences clearly saw the monster as antagonist once it was created. From my perspective, Victor Frankenstein is as much at fault for the monster's actions as the monster, and it's a wonder that none of the village turns on him for creating the monster in the first place, even contrite as he is. I do have to say that, having read Mary Shelley's novel, the movie falls short in many respects. The book brings a richness to the characters that is not present in the movie, and has a much longer timeline than the movie, which brings more verisimilitude to the characters than the movie can.",Frankenstein

Boris Karlov, wow, he manages to take a character who is unable to articulate more than grunts, yet he is the most expressive in the film, or almost all horror films I have seen to be frank. If you look you can see how tormented the monster is during the closeups, how confused and scared by the world around it.

That is mostly just personal preference though and not really justification on why a movie is good or bad. I gave this movie a 5 not because it is a horror movie but because I did not really like it at all. There was some parts I enjoyed but most of it I was not a big fan of and if it wasn't for the fact that this was a classic movie that was well made and historically important I probably would have gave it an even lower score then a 5. My honest opinion on it is that if you are a fan of horror or classic movies you will definitely have to check this movie if not I wouldn't really recommend this and I will most likely never watch it again myself.,Frankenstein
454,Cinemarker,The True Monster is Frankenstein,8,11 March 2015,"Frankenstein is a monster movie classic and a must watch for a film enthusiast of any kind. Boris Karloff's performance within this one has made him a household name, even today. The Dr. is the most frightening character in the movie. He plays with the idea of human life and how to create in an unnatural way. Karloff plays ""the monster"" as gentle giant. He is learning about the world and has the mental state of that of a small child. He does not know right from wrong and because of this accidentally kills the young girl, Maria. Each of the scenes within this movie drives the plot forward. There are no unnecessary scenes that draw out the movie and make it longer then it should be. While Dr. Frankenstein created the monster, it is clear to the audience that the Dr. is in fact the true monster of the film.",Frankenstein
455,corypom,good,7,11 February 2013,"The thing I really liked about this film, is just the basis of it all. How one man, Henry Frankenstein, wants to create a new life. Unfortunately he creates a bad creature. He's tormented by Frankensteins servant who isn't very pleasant. The monster becomes raged and ends up killing the man who tormented him. This really takes Henry Frankenstein back and makes him truly look at the seriousness of this situation. So him and Dr. Waldman subdue the creature and Henry heads back home for his wedding.Just up until this point alone, i really liked the story and the original concept because of the 'Horror' but yet humor still within it. The shots were well done and i didn't mind the acting that much. I just liked the story most of all. Definitely a must see as its the original and just a classic in general.",Frankenstein
456,courtxanne,It's alive!!!,7,24 September 2014,"I really enjoyed this movie because all of the effects involved made it so much easier to stay entertained. It was constantly busy and always kept you on your toes especially when the doctor was first trying out the experiment on getting Frankenstein to come alive. Obviously that was one of the biggest events, and one of my favorites. The effects and the intensity leading up to him just moving his hand showing he was alive was enough to just keep you on the edge of your seat. That's not something I really expected from a movie this old especially because I cant find a lot of movies nowadays that make me feel like that. Towards the end though it started to lose me because I felt bad in a way because you kind of make a connection with Frankenstein even though he is a ""monster"" and does horrid things to people. So just seeing him being chased by crowds holding fire was kind of upsetting in a way, in my opinion.",Frankenstein

Which then leads to: what is it to be good? The monster in this film might have been inherently bad because of the criminals brain that he was made with, but we don't know if the murders he committed was because he was just misunderstood. From the very beginning of the monsters life, he was abused by Fritz, Frankenstein's assistant. Threatened with fire which was the down fall of him by the end. It was also made quite obvious that he did not intend to hurt the playing little girl which made the hunt begin.",Frankenstein

What Whale is able to create is a compelling vision of his own that inspired filmmakers for many years to come.  The visuals are stunning and the performances are first rate for such an early talkie.  It ranks second on my list of the top films of 1931 (behind only Chaplin's City Lights).  The Academy missed it, instead choosing fit to honor the stiff ""epic"" Cimarron (which is not as bad as many people say, but isn't all that good either). Frankenstein still holds up after 70 years, it may not be able to shock audiences as it did in 1931, but it remains a memorable piece of cinema.",Frankenstein
459,kaos_katt9,Dr. Frankenstein was a god who created life with his monster. Universal Studios and James Whale were gods who created life with this film.,10,1 October 2010,"Dr. Frankenstein was a god who created life with his monster. Universal Studios and James Whale were gods who created life with this film.After watching Dracula (1931) and being disappointed, I thought that Frankenstein wouldn't be too much to my liking either, but I was wrong. There were no parts in this film that didn't keep my attention. At times, though, I felt that this was a mediocre movie, but as soon as those thoughts arose I always came across a scene that would take the film to a new level.Before talking of specific scenes, I want to mention the obvious things that I must talk about. The writing for this film was very good. Nothing like the book (but I knew that before going into the movie thankfully) but it at least grasps the idea and themes of the book and portrays them quite well. James Whale also did some great directing on his part. One of the two of the most impacting scenes in the film were displayed fantastically and without a doubt perfect. The acting by the more ""villainous"" characters of the film (Dr Frankenstein, the Monster, and Fritz) was phenomenal, while the rest of the acting was quite average in my opinion.The writing for this film took many specific themes from the book, especially the 'God-like' theme that is the most important. It isn't portrayed very well in this movie, at least not nearly as much as in the book, but it is still there. The book is much more subtle in showing it's themes of 'God' and 'creation'. The film has these, but not as many, and not as subtle either. I didn't see many thought of 'God' and 'creation' up until the scene where Frankenstein's Monster comes to life and Dr. Frankenstein exclaims ""Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!"" That scene shoved into your face those two themes, but they did it in a more polite way than just forcing them on you.James Whale's directing seemed very mundane at times, nothing to extraordinary. He would just shoot the scenes and nothing seemed too unique to me. But, as soon as I would start thinking the film is mediocre, he would come across and take another scene but shoot it in the most fantastic way. One instance of this is the most hard-hitting scene of the film, when the farmer is holding his daughter, little Maria, after the Monster had accidentally drowned her and is sullenly walking through the village. What a very sad and upsetting scene as the camera takes one shot to show him walking past all of the partying villagers with the deepest of emotionless faces a man can show.I must also give Whale credit for shooting the scene where the Monster throws Dr. Frankenstein off of the building. At the time of the film, back in 1931, to show someone being thrown off a building, hitting a windmill, and then falling to what looks like his death, must not only have been controversial and surprising to see but also very difficult to shoot without the use of the effects we have now. Two thumbs up to you James; you are indeed a master of your craft.As for the acting, most of it was bland, except for the portrayals of Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Fritz. Colin Clive's performance of Henry Frankenstein started out as mediocre as the rest of the characters but increasingly got better throughout the film as the character and characters around him developed and changed. Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster gave a great performance. All he really needed to do was wobble around and give out groans and moans, but Karloff brought much more to the character than the average person could have and he made the Monster feel much more human than he was, which was perfect. Last, but certainly not least, Dwight Frye's performance as Fritz was stunning. Maybe it's just me, but Frye seems to be one of the greatest actors of all time that could portray such dark, disturbing, and insane characters. Probably the most disturbing scene of the film is when Fritz is showing his 'power' over the Monster with fire by scaring it over and over again with the torch he is carrying. It shows just how terrible human kind can be and how we can go from mere human to terrible monster just by having power over others. That is still something that exists in societies today and is still a thought that is as terrifying as ever.Overall I must say this film greatly exceeds my expectations and is now one of my favorite horror films of all time. A timeless classic with themes that are still relevant today and some of the earliest stunning acting and directing in horror film history that could still be watched and learned from today.9.5/10",Frankenstein
460,theodore_varengo,'Stein holds up,9,22 April 2007,"The beautiful thing about a true work of art in any genre or any medium is that it will stand the test of time and be just as intriguing 75 years later if not more so. Well, FRANKENSTEIN definitely stands up to that test as a timeless horror classic featuring the definitive movie monster. Of course, in 2007, it's not a film that will scare your pants off... everyone has seen the Frankenstein Monster as immortalized by Boris Karloff, he's as big of a fictional American icon as Mickey Mouse or Superman, so his appearance in the film is more likely to bring warm feelings of recognition rather than fright. That doesn't mean that the film is boring (it fairly flies by at just over an hour) or lacking spooky atmospherics (it may not terrify you, but it can still deliver Halloweenish goose bumps with its foggy graveyards and stormy nights), but the thing that still knocks me out is the set design and the Germanic, expressionist cinematography. Although BRIDE OF FRANKESNTEIN was clearly made with a much bigger budget, they definitely made the best out of what they had in this first feature, and certainly the laboratory equipment is still a treat to behold. The retro effect of watching the creation scene in 2007 only adds to its appeal. I also think the lack of a score and the relative crudeness of the film in comparison to later flicks in the series adds to the film rather than detracts. Karloff is great as the sympathetic creature, and Colin Clive is delightfully manic as Frankenstein. Sure the acting is dated and melodramatic at times... the film was made in 1931, you have to keep the performances in that perspective. But the overall artistry of the production, the better-than-you'd-expect dialogue and acting, and James Whale's distinctive direction all add up to make this landmark film the granddaddy of all monster movies.",Frankenstein
461,sevenup@neo.rr.com,Baron Henry Frankenstein And The Frankenstein Monster,10,28 January 2005,"James Whales' version of ""Frankenstein"" is many times removed from Mary Shelley's novel as most of Hollywood's films are.But this is the version of ""Frankenstein"" that we all know ...even better than Shelley's classic,but difficult novel. If a person wants a film version that follows Mary Shelley's novel to the letter but is still a classic piece of cinema and is chilling,atmospheric and memorable then one should see the film ""Terror Of Frankenstein"".Producer Calvin Floyd made it and it is a great version of the novel and a film that is neither boring or suffering from a star's ego to tell his version of the story as was Kenneth Brannagh's film which is not the masterpiece that it and a variety of uninformed other's have claimed it to be.Universal's ""Frankenstein""(1931) is an amazing film to see.It is uniquely it's own version of the tale of a medical student who is not a doctor but is a scientist on his own misguided quest to create life from the dead.Colin Clive is Baron Henry Frankenstein who has chosen to break any ties that he had with the medical school where he had attended.In this writer's opinion Colin Clive is Baron Frankenstein and he's ideal as the reasonably mad scientist.Also this writer prefers Frankenstein's first name being changed to Henry for this film and for the entire Universal series.How sad that Clive would only live to the age of 37 and expire in 1937.Boris Karloff is the Frankenstein Monster.James Whale,Boris Karloff and makeup magician Jack Pierce are all responsible for one of the all time greatest movie monsters ever to show his pathetic face on the silver screen!The Universal version of the Frankenstein Monster with Boris Karloff portraying the part made me feel that way back as a child I was seeing Frankenstein's Monster actually alive on film for the first time.It is still a superb sight to see even to this day more than 30 years later! From the very beginning of ""Frankenstein""we are shown the black,white and gray images of death as Baron Henry Frankenstein and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz(Dwight Frye) steal bodies from newly buried graves and roadside gallows. Henry Frankenstein takes these corpses to his laboratory which is in the top of an old stone watchtower.Frankenstein tells his former teacher(Edward Van Sloan) that he has ...""found the ray that had first brought life into this world"" and in his laboratory's machinery he has harnassed it to bring his creature to life!It is Henry Frankenstein who declares(before he brings his creation to life)that,""That body is not dead.It has never lived.""After the creature has been brought to life and has been presumably living in the dungeon of this ancient watchtower that we first see the immortal first images of The Frankenstein Monster.Karloff's monster is gigantic in size with a flat head, a bolt sticking out of either side of his neck,a neanderthal like brow that looms over his 2 eyes which have dark circles under them and eyelids that droop so far over his eyes that he appears to be only half alive.This Monster is a pitiful child who tries to grab for light when it's first cast upon him and is afraid of fire when the sadistic Fritz cruelly tortures him with it. This performance of Boris Karloff proves that he was one of the greatest actors that ever lived along with Spencer Tracy,Gene Hackman,Al Pacino,Edward G. Robinson,Peter Lorre,Charles Laughton,Jack Nicholson,Henry Fonda,James Cagney and James Stewart. Boris Karloff's last great film is the drama""Targets""(1968}.Karloff expired in 1969 at the age of 81.Universal's first 3 Frankenstein films: ""Frankenstein""(1931),""Bride Of Frankenstein""(1935) and ""Son Of Frankenstein""(1939)are stark wonders to behold...see them when you can!",Frankenstein
462,brianross,The Book is a Whole Lot Better!,4,19 August 2003,"This movie totally changed the story and the charatcters, and thus diminishing and almost destroying the themes and meaning to the story. The movie could be worse, for it does a good job of the giving the horror feel to it. However, the book has a whole lot more to say. The ending of the movie was the total opposite of Mary Shelley's intentions about how one should feel about Dr. Frankenstein's actions.I can't say the movie was horrible, but it wasn't good either. If you want pure entertainment without thinking too much, the movie is fine. However, if you want the real version of the Frankenstein story with quality themes and meaning, definately choose the book.Rating of the movie: 5/10 Rating of the book: 9/10",Frankenstein

While enthusiasts of the genre would largely recognize the disparity between the film and the novel, to a more casual viewer, this film is very much the definition of ""Frankenstein,"" both in terms of its visual design of the creature as well as the signature (and oft-parodied) set-pieces. Even those who have never seen the film in its entirety would recognize large swatches of the story, based on nothing more than cultural osmosis.

I loved King Kong and all those old movies but Frankenstein wasn't for me. The cinematography in parts where really good, but the only good acting was from Frankenstein and the scientist. It was a nice experience because it's a ""classic"" and I've never seen it before so it was refreshing but it was too slow for me. The best scene was the ending where the building was on fire. That kept me watching the whole time, but that cannot single handedly carry the film. It also wasn't very realistic to have the scientists survive when thrown off the windmill and actually get nailed by the windmill and falls all that distant. It had me chuckling which shouldn't be my first reaction.",Frankenstein

I watched this film for the 2nd time yesterday the 1st time i saw it I was a lot younger and didn't understand the message behind this movie. The message is that Henry thinks he is a form of a God and can create another human being. He was horrifically wrong because the human he made turns into a vicious monster. I really like the part where the monster is playing with the little girl (Maria). Maria shows the monster how her flowers float in the water and then the Monster proceeded to make his flowers float in the water. Its a great scene because the monster throws Maria into the water without any intentions of killing her. This shows that the monster has the brain of a little kid but the body of a full grown man, the monster didn't know any better and didn't know what he did. I would highly recommend anyone who likes horror films to watch this one because it is great and its truly a classic one.",Frankenstein
466,Nick_Charles,Flawed classic,9,15 November 2005,"""Frankenstein"" certainly is among the better monster movies ever, and quite possibly among the better movies of all time. It has a strong message about horror and innocence, and it delivers it very well.It is, however, flawed. Like many early sound films, the transition from acting in silent movies to talkies hasn't quite settled on many of the actors, and there are a number of exaggerated facial expressions and staccato and clumsy line readings. The make up is also a bit over the top, and not all of the characters, especially the extras, seem to care too much. The German language is horrible, and the depiction of Switzerland (at least that's where it is supposed to be in the book, despite the Bavarian look) is that of an anachronistic village, where 30's suits and sophisticated headphones exist, but guns don't. I also think that Henry Frankenstein's reflections on what he has created and what he must do is too quick and his decision too relentless.What does make it brilliant is that it has a very good cast in some of the characters. Boris Karloff steals the show from his entrance to his exit. He is simply brilliant as a misunderstood monster. While Edward van Sloan (dr. Waldman) and Dwight Frye (Fritz) are good, the second best performance is that of Michael Mark, the father of the unfortunate little girl. The adaptation of the story is also good. One is reminded of Nietzsche's ""Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster"", for surely the villagers are out of control, lusting for the blood of an innocent. The end is also wonderfully enigmatic.In conclusion, this film is great for four simple reasons: Boris Karloff, a handful of other actors, great scenography and the end. The minor faults I have blown out of proportions are easy enough to ignore. I strongly recommend it.",Frankenstein
467,destinyhugill,interesting and creepy,7,15 December 2015,Frankenstein (1931) is one of the first horror movies and really paved the way for the genre to be successful. The plot of this film is truly captivating from the dramatic creation of the monster to the angry mob terrorizing the town. The acting in this film also adds to its thrill and the roles where cast perfectly. What really sets this movie up for success is the setting the castle that this monster was created in is creepy and eerie. Also the weather and the lighting strike add to the scare factor of this film.

This movie aided in pioneering the horror genre and for good reason. The use of close-ups give viewers an idea just how terrifying the monster is. The whole film is shot in poor lighting that usually casts shadows adding to the movie's tone of terror. Using the gothic aesthetic blended with early science fiction creates a feeling of dread all throughout this movie. It deals a lot with the idea of life and with it, death.

When he appeared in the movie ""Scarface""(1932) he was credited as Boris ""Frankenstein"" Karloff.

471,tayandbay,a flawed but historic hour of cinema,7,21 February 2005,"Just as the Beatles influenced popular music for decades after they came and went, so did ""Frankenstein"" shape the landscape for cinematic horror. Had this film been an artistic and/or commercial failure, the American Horror Film would have evolved in a totally different direction, had it survived at all.It is remarkable that the conventions established in this early talking film would continue to be utilized by serious filmmakers for over four decades, until ""The Exorcist"" (1973) changed the rules.However, ""Frankenstein"" remains a flawed classic, partially because it's characters have, over time, become almost comical (even without the endless satires), partially because of some of the supporting performances (which inspired the endless satires), and partially because of the primitive technology available at Universal Studios in 1931. Even the tiny Hal Roach Studios produced more sophisticated product at the time.But what of the assets? Charles D. Hall's art direction is striking, as are some of Arthur Edeson's photographic compositions. Colin Clive remains compelling as Henry Frankenstein, the intense medical adventurer, although he seems pushed to the brink at times by director James Whale, a smart, imaginative filmmaker who didn't always know when to apply restraint.Then there is Boris Karloff as the monster; Karloff was (and is) underrated as an actor, mainly because he became content to lend himself more as a personality rather than as a performer in numerous films, especially after the mid-1940's. But Karloff, aided by magnificent makeup designed by Jack Pierce, perfectly captured the misery, desperation and loneliness of an artificially fabricated creature in this film, guided by Whale's unexpectedly sensitive direction.""Frankenstein"" survives as a flawed, but historic -- and necessary -- document that set the course for one of cinema's most enduring genres.",Frankenstein

473,armeniantree,still a classic,8,24 September 2014,"After watching this movie for the first time recently, I can definitely see why this movie is considered a classic. Dr. Frankenstein worked so incredibly hard and was willing to sacrifice everything in order to recreate a person. I thought it was interesting how he put so much effort into his creation, and then once the creation comes to life, he doesn't seem to put the same amount of effort into caring for his creation. He leaves him often in the care of Fritz, who is shown in the movie hitting him and torturing him with fire. When the creation finally fights back and kills Fritz, from that point on Frankenstein considers him to be a monster and wants to have him killed. The other people in the movie that the monster murders are the doctor thats trying to kill him, and the little girl who he kills by accident. I thought the sad scene of the man carrying his dead little girl was done well in the movie. The camera follows as he's carrying her through the town, and all the townspeople go from celebrating to watching in horror and following the man. When the reach the Frankenstein house, everyone hears of the news of the monster and are ready to take action and keep the plot flowing very smoothly.",Frankenstein
474,cstaeble,The torch burning mob is more scary than the monster,9,6 October 2005,"While Boris Karloff does a wonderful job giving emotion to the monster, the reaction evoked towards the monster is itself scary. German peasants carrying torches and burning someone alive in a windmill circa 1931 lends its own scary quality to the movie. Wagnerian strains of ubermensch scientist playing god carries a nasty tinge of what the Nazis would soon do to Europe. The monster can be seen as symbolic of a society's attitude toward the mentally ill.The audience has an odd hint of sympathy to the monster struggling to comprehend its new environment. I am thinking about the scene where the monster smiles at the little girl giving him a flower to toss into the water. Ultimately, the monster ultimately cannot understand and kills the girl. The audience is simultaneously repelled and sympathetic towards the monster.Shelley's book Frankenstein was a reaction to the emerging emancipation of the English peasants. Shelley's monster, if I remember correctly, was given an education by Dr. Frankenstein. English society's correctly feared that education would create a Frankenstein monster that would destabilize the rigid class structure.",Frankenstein

Frankenstein is a very gloomy movie and one thing in particular that produces this sense of ""gloom"" are the sets. In my opinion, the sets in this film are incredibly designed for the time period and engulf the viewer in the surreal world that is Frankenstein. Another thing about this movie that makes it stand out is the acting of Boris Karloff. Karloff creates a very horrifying yet innocent monster and without him Frankenstein would not be the classic that it has become today.

As for the acting, I thought Colin Clive plays a compelling Henry Frankenstein and Boris Karloff plays The Monster to perfection. I love the sets the different scenes are shot in.

You can tell the people behind the movie put so much effort in making the mise-en-scene just right for every shot.

A sympathetic monster made from the corpses of men is portrayed by British actor Boris Karloff. His portrayal of a simple, but powerful creature, shaped by the cruelty of his captors would be engraved into popular culture. His towering posture, iconic prosthetic makeup, and shambling walk became synonymous to the creature. Colin Clive's line ""IT'S ALIVE!

I really enjoyed this movie. the plot was on point. the acting was very good especially Boris Karloff. even though he didn't speak, his body language and his facial expressions stoled the show. i felt sympathy for the monster. he really wasn't a monster at all. he had a heart and all he really wanted was to be loved. he was more like a little kid that didn't know any better. with the scene where the girl gives him a flower to throw in the water then he threw the girl in, it wasn't like he was trying to kill her, he seen her as beautiful flower and wanted to see if she would float. its like you can't judge a book by its cover and also be careful what you wish for because it might not be how you wanted. the camera movement was good and forms of continuity was good.",Frankenstein
481,hellrazorx44,The Horror Classic,8,18 October 2014,"Frankenstein (1931) is the quintessential horror movie, full of iconic movie movements like the creation of the monster and his reveal. The mood of this movie is dark and grim. Boris Karloff is great as the monster, he makes you feel sympathetic for him as he is misunderstood and Colin Clive plays the Dr. Frankenstein a man who is heavily dedicated to the creation of the monster, with the help of his hatchback assistant Fritz. The infamous scene where Frankenstein tosses the young girl in the pond seems quite tame by today's standard, but the scene is dark and sad as we know the monster doesn't know what he's doing is wrong.Jack Pierce creates the famous Frankenstein make-up that every Frankenstein movie following tries to copy.Frankenstein (1931) helped launch the career of Boris Karloff and Turing him into a horror icon even though he was not listed in the opening credits and the role of the monster was to be played be Dracula star Bela Lugosi who declined it because the role had no lines, which he regretted after the movie release.",Frankenstein

""Frankenstein"" is one of those films that speaks not of its original inspiration, but of its director. James Whale has created a cinematic masterpiece, surpassed only by its sequel. It is a shame that Karloff's interpretation and Jack Pierce's make-up have for the past 70 years overshadowed the novel. At the same time, however, both men gave the monster, and the movies, an entirely new personality. Besides, what would we have if all movie makers stuck unwaveringly close to the original source? Nothing very original, I'm sure. If you want the book, read the book. If you want a good scare, or laugh, or cry, see the movie.",Frankenstein

If you want to see a movie version of Frankenstein that's closer to Mary Shelley's book, see the gosh-awful, overblown Kenneth Branagh version.  If you want to see a film that takes the concept of the Shelley book but that explores its own themes, true to its own time and medium, see the great 1931 version.  The book is about the hubris of science and rationalism; the movie is just as much about identity and isolation.

Screening in for just over an hour I recommend that any and all monster movie enthusiasts watch this classic from 1931.Unfortunately, nearly a century later it's lacking some finer details that complete the ensemble dictated by today's standards.

486,Eebster,There were good things,7,14 February 2015,"For me there were things I liked a lot, and there were things that I didn't enjoy as much. To start I enjoyed the directing. Specifically the use of quadrants, in the scene in which Dr. Frankenstein had all of them in his lab to prove to them that he had done it, that he was right. And in that scene while he was trying to prove how right he was, the camera only showed him on the right half of the screen. That is, until he turned the wheel, that was the final step in bringing his monster to life. That was when he was first shown on the left side of the screen. I thought that was brilliant. Later on though it seemed that his character changed too much without the amount of character development that he needed. He starts out as this mad scientist that only cares about his work and then all of a sudden when the monster is freed he changes into this caring man righteous man. And you end up feeling like you're supposed to feel bad for him but you don't really, because he was just a psycho a few scenes ago. It was just too rapid of change.",Frankenstein

This was about a man that created a beast that was very misunderstood, meaning, yes he created him but this person (some might say monster) wasn't asked to be here however he did not no right from wrong. moral of this movie is ""be careful what you create, sometimes you can create your own Monster""",Frankenstein
488,James Cagney,GRANDFATHER OF HORROR FILMS,10,15 October 1999,"Growing up in the early 60's this movie scared the heck out of me every time I watched it.  The sets, the Gothic atmosphere, the make up and Boris Karloff make this movie a true horror classic.  The movie may be vintage by today's standards, but even without the blood, gore and special effects of the modern horror films this movie is still number one in my book. Although the film was made 68 years ago, and numerous horror films have been made since, come Halloween you can always find Karloff's monster on a display somewhere.  Without a doubt this movie is the grandfather of all horror films.",Frankenstein
489,ellabellacookie,Stands the test of time,9,20 March 2021,"It's no secret that film has come a long way since the 1930's. However this film in particular holds it's place against the best of them with its appropriately gothic black and white, dramatic acting, theatric lighting and terrific concept.
As an avid reader and great fan of the book I was expecting changes to be made. After all, the growling and groaning Frankenstein's monster that is so deeply engrained in everyone's peripheral is far from his eloquent and sorrowful novel counterpart. I was pleasantly surprised by Boris Karloff's sympathetic take on a character that could have easily become a one dimensional beast with his lack of dialogue and child-manslaughter. While the portrayal remains separate from the book, I thoroughly enjoyed the Lennie-esque direction, and the criminal brain scapegoat for Frankenstein adds another theme of nature vs nurture to an already nuanced story.
Obviously the film is dated. It does not horrify viewers as effectively as a modern day fear flick might, despite it's opening monologue which ends up being the creepiest part of the film. However it is so fascinating in every aspect of its production. From its German expressionistic aesthetics, to its empty scoreless sound, it is definitely worth a watch",Frankenstein

No CGI effect can duplicate Boris Karloff's portrayal of ""the monster"", actually, present day CGI generated effects look decidedly childish, cartoonesk and paradoxically, wholly implausible.

True art is eternal.",Frankenstein
494,extantabstractxx,Good for its time,8,24 March 2010,"If you've read Mary Shelly's original novel Frankenstein and are expecting to see it come to life on the big screen (or whatever size your television screen is) prepare to be extremely disappointed. For one, the monster is completely illiterate the whole movie, all he does is grunt. Second, in the movie, the monsters desire to commit murder and cause terror among the town folk comes from the criminal brain the doctor's assistant, Fritz, accidentally puts in the monster. In the book, his desire to commit murder among other atrocities comes from his hatred of mankind from condemning him due to his appearance. The movie is the epitome of 1931 special effects, and it's as good as it gets for being made more than seventy five years ago. Boris Karloff did do a fantastic job as the monster, however, and the flat-head makeup and outfit are perfect for his role. Colin Clive was also outstanding at portraying the doctor who gave the monster life, and he captured the emotions that came with playing god and the eventual regret for creating such an atrocity after it began killing the citizens of the town below. The set was flawless, all the machines and devices and mechanisms in the laboratory running perfectly and perfectly portraying the sanctum of a mad doctor capable of producing life where there was once none. The movie opens with a warning from Edward Van Sloan, stating that what you are about to witness may ""shock you, surprise you, and maybe even horrify you"", and explaining the basic plot of the story. I wouldn't say it's scary or frightening or even surprising, but I believe that this is mainly due to the fact that I'm very desensitized, as is most of America, and I strongly believe that if I grew up in the 1930's, I would have been extremely frightened by this picture.",Frankenstein
495,burchbeer92,This movie was mediocre,2,20 April 2010,"This movie was absolutely dreadful. The idea that people can raise someone from the dead from a series of different corpses is preposterous. The movie is the story of an ambitious man who decides he will play with the forces of nature and create a living creature. It starts in the Goldstadt town of he devotes all his time away from his soon to be wife and from his rather rich father. While collecting parts, his assistant fritz went to the university to retrieve a brain. A crucial error created a setback that would set the stage for all the unfortunate events that will occur in this movie. See the assistant dropped the brain that was labeled normal and it got brain ooze on the nice floor. Either way he ended up grabbing the brain marked as ""CRIMINAL"" and returned to the good doctor. Now the monster was given a criminals brain and was unleashed on the world. The monster doesn't seem inherently evil he just almost seems like someone of little to no mental functions. He has the mentality of a 9 year old this can be shown when he meets the little girl then throws her into the water because they were throwing in flowers. Also because of his hideous looks he scares people which end up shooting at him. In the end a mob chases them into a mill that is burnt to the ground. The movie had a few starch differences than the book. See in the book the monster was given the ability to learn reason in the movie the monster was a slow learning half wit that couldn't function at all by itself.",Frankenstein

Grand sets, expert cinematography and excellent acting courtesy of Boris Karloff have made this a classic monster film that has stood the test of time. Karloff helped make the character of Frankenstein's monster both imposing and sympathetic at the same time. This monster that is capable of such violent actions is also shown to have the basic emotions that make us human leading to mixed emotions regarding the character.

When watching the 1931 version of ""Frankenstein"", I can easily see that the only things the movie shares with the book are the characters' names and what the scientist's experiments were. There is no one named ""Fritz"" in the book, the man that works on the experiments is Victor, not Henry. (Henry is Victor's little brother that is killed by the creature at a very young age). The way that the creature is made evil (by giving him a ""criminal"" brain) is completely inaccurate. The creature has a normal brain and begins his life as a benevolent, while grotesque, human being. In short, there is NOTHING that this pitiful film has in common with the novel. This is an awful representation of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"", which is an excellent book. If you want the story, read Shelley's novel, and forget this inaccurate and dim-witted, (not to mention untalented) movie.",Frankenstein

Also Frankensteins creature also having an amazed look on his faced, but he did not use words the entire film and he kept his stiff form. A part of the movie that made me laugh a little was actually when the little girl was tossed into the lake because it was just so random, frankenstein seemed happy one moment and then he toss's the girl.

507,vb-49213,SOMEBODY GOT THE WRONG BRAIN!,7,20 August 2020,"Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is a young scientist with a great future ahead, who is about to marry a beautiful girl named Elizabeth (Mae Clarke). So what does he do? He leaves his family and goes to live in a dark, dingy castle where he can conduct his ""experiments."" He steals bodies from graveyards and medical schools, hoping to create a ""man"" by putting parts of those bodies together (yes, I know it's gross). But for some reason, instead of getting a brain himself, he sends his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) to steal one from a medical school. Frightened by a noise, Fritz drops the normal brain, and gives his master a ""criminal"" brain.
Let this be a lesson to us all. If you ever set out to create a monster, never rely on underlings to get your brain. Always get it yourself!
Elizabeth, meanwhile, is frantic. She visits Frankenstein's old professor Doctor Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), who promises to talk to Henry. Elizabeth, the good doctor, and her friend Victor Moritz (John Boles) pay a visit to the castle just as Henry is about to conduct his experiment. With the body strapped to a table, he raises it up during a severe thunderstorm. When lightning strikes, it comes to life.
But the ""man"" Henry created is more like a wild animal, totally out of control. It is strange that Henry is surprised when Dr. Waldman tells him the Monster has a criminal brain. The label on the jar containing the brain clearly states: ABNORMAL BRAIN! DO NOT USE!
Mae Clarke was terrified of doing the scene where she is locked in her room and Frankie comes in through the open window. To calm her fears, Karloff told her that as he chases her around the room, he will wiggle his little finger (off camera). ""This will remind you that it's just me, Boris.""
And speaking of being unhappy, Karloff was quite upset about the scene where he has to throw Little Maria (Marilyn Harris) into the lake. He didn't want to do it, but director James Whale insisted. (When the film was first shown in American theaters, this scene was cut.)
Now here's the way I would have done it. Show the Monster reaching out to grab the girl. Then cut to the scene of the wedding party in the village. We know the little girl is dead because her father is carrying her down the street in his arms. (By the way, when he says his daughter was murdered, he has absolutely no proof. He was away at work and never saw the Monster. As far as he knows, the girl could have slipped on a rock and fallen into the lake accidentally.)
The burning windmill at the end of the movie is a magnificent shot. If you have a home theater and can view it on the big screen, it's just breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's somewhat spoiled when we see Henry fall out of the structure. It's obviously a dummy.
Overall, I think the film is true to the message of Mary Shelly's book. Man cannot ""play God"" by trying to create human life. If he tries, the results will only lead to disaster.",Frankenstein
508,thuantrn,Took its novel source material and crapped all over it,2,29 May 2017,"Scores Overall: 3/10 Script: 4/10 Acting: 2/10 Visuals + Cinematography: 6/10 Character development: 0/10Attempting to make a classic 1931 horror? Look no further because I have the recipe. Take your source material from a classic novel, say Frankenstein, crap all over it, give the actors virtually nothing to work with in terms of dialogue, then put all the mushiness together, and voila, you've got your own 1931's Frankenstein. This movie is one of the most dreadful experience I've had the ""opportunity"" to sit through. The plot is weak and filled with holes unanswered by the director, the screenplay is nothing but cheese, the pacing is incoherent, and the actors' performances so wooden they could easily be compared to Kristen Stewart's. Sure, cinematography-wise, the movie is somewhat less off putting, considering the fact that it was made more than 70 years ago. Some shots must have certainly been quite revolutionary at the time, but cinematography and visuals alone can hardly help this film's lack of entertainment.The movie's source material, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, is a lesson to its audience in many ways; it anticipates a person's downfall through greediness of knowledge; warns of the devastating effects that neglect can have on people; and all around shows a humane side that can be matched by little other novels. It, however, skips over all the character development and inner thoughts necessary to recreate, or come close to, the same emotional depth that its novel counterpart possesses. I personally feel like the film was too focused on its sound effects (which compared to nowadays effects, are pretty much noises) and production design, which of course, is very important in a movie. However, since the emphasis is put too much on these aspects, the movie falls short of the profundity that its source builds towards. While watching the movie, I could not help but realize that there was virtually no development in the monster's character, as opposed to the immense amount of evolution that Mary Shelley's bestow on her monster. This was the real problem with the movie, that its characters are way too flat to convey any kind of emotions for the audience. This cannot be backed up more by its incredibly short, 70-minute, running time, which is extraordinarily condensed compared to other good movies, or just about any movie at all. The time span of just a bit more than an hour is unable to do the novel justice, which is why the movie fails for me. Technically talking, I thought the script was way too ""big"". Cheesy, over- dramatized, and just too ""big"" for its own good. The actors are given very little opportunity to show their feelings and acting because of the terrible screenplay, which explains their extremely wooden acting (notably Colin Clive's). As for the ""groundbreaking"" visuals, I have no problem with it, except that it takes away a lot of the director's attention from what could have been a well-made and emotionally drenching plot.",Frankenstein

Karloff is able to transform the monster into both a sympathetic and terrifying creature, which is no easy task. Karloff was able to find the humanity in what many others have portrayed as a lumbering, stiff-walking oaf. However, James Whale and Boris Karloff together were able to craft a film that remains a masterpiece of early horror to this day.",Frankenstein
510,vbalbert-2,The genesis of all monster movies,9,21 October 1999,"I see that there are several who see this movie and say it ""sucks"".  They are obviously looking at this either to be a faithful representation of Shelley's book or have complaints about the fact that it's black and white or some other disdain about the technical prowess of the movie.In 1931 special effects were still in a very infantile state.  Effects artists did not have the ""squibs"" used today to simulate gunshots.  Instead they used sharp shooters who actually shot towards the actors to get the effect needed.Jack Pierce's makeup is a marvel for its time.  Even today the full method of the makeup Karloff wore is unknown.  This is the monster that people see when they think of the name Frankenstein.  All others are mere ""melted"" faces.But while the makeup is fabulous, it wouldn't have meant anything without the talent of Karloff behind it.  This is great acting because of the limitations put upon the character.  Karloff could only emote with grunts, facial expressions and body language.  Yet he showed the anger, the happiness, the innocence and the tragedy that the Creature needed to show the audience.  If you are one of those who saw this picture and did not like it, watch it again and REALLY watch Karloff's performance.I don't see this as a horror movie, although there are horrific elements. Interestingly enough, I don't see horror so much in the Creature as I do in the actions of Fritz, Frankenstein's malformed assistance.  Fritz, a troll of a man only finds solace in tormenting the Creature with a torch and pays for his actions with his death.It is supsenseful when the search is on for the Creature, when Henry and company search through the house looking for the creature.  Where is it? What does he want?  What will he do?  The creature's motives are made clear with the terrorization of Elizabeth.And while Elizabeth doesn't die as she does in the book, you can see Karloff's portrayal anger as he looks upon her.  You can see that the Creature hates Henry so much he hates the bride of Henry.Indeed, this is a movie that has great pathos, drama, and suspense for those who would look for them.  Truly, one of the greatest movies ever made.Thomas Edison made the first Frankenstein movie and there were other silent versions before James Whale's version.

Editing and camera techniques are not revolutionary, actually they're even far from standard skill. Acting was not too great and writing was horrendous if compared to the novel by Mary Shelley.

514,hamfio,"A suspenseful film, with great acting.",9,5 November 2021,"""Frankenstein,"" based on the book my Mary Shelly, shows masterful execution of visual effects, nonverbal acting, and elements of horror in general. The acting is brilliant; Boris Karloff specifically, portrays The Monster with a disturbing yet all too human demeanor. The sound design, while lacking in the musical aspect, is very well executed; moments in Henry's lab are deathly quiet, and suspenseful, while the scene in the mountains while the townsfolk are on the hunt for The Monster is much louder than the rest, to emphasize the shouts and yells of the horrified and angered townsfolk. The point of view, while a bit confusing with the shifting perspective, furthers the plot smoothly. An original story for its time, the film's story flows nicely, with a perfect balance of dialogue driven story and visual driven story. The sequencing supports the storyline well for the most part, save for switching point of view a little bit too frequently. The transition from one scene to another is exceptionally smooth. Within the film's context the story is believable, even though it has supernatural elements, it explains them in a scientific manner. The storyline stays sequential throughout the film, which increases the smoothness of the transitions between perspective shifts. The characters are portrayed well by the actors, as well as being written well in the first place. They are very believable, and their actions and placement feel natural. The setting is dark a gloomy for most of the film which adds to the horror, while it appears bright and happy during the segments in the town, there is still that lingering suspense present from the beginning of the film. The music score is very lacking, not that much music is used throughout the film. As mentioned previously, the sound volume is very dynamic and adds to the atmosphere. The special effects are used very sparingly but add to the story when utilized. The elements of horror work together nicely, James Whale did an excellent job meshing everything together to create an excellent blend of the technical aspects and artistic aspects. The movie overall is not very scary as far as horror movies go, however the scene at the end of the film where The Monster is trapped in the burning windmill is one of the truly horrifying moments in film. You can see and feel how horrified The Monster is, and with loud distorted human-like screams, hear it too. You feel horrified not only at the scene itself, but also at the sheer delight the townsfolk seem to take in the gruesome moment, cheering and celebrating. It is a chilling look at how we as humans can become truly horrible people when we are afraid. Overall, this film utilized dynamic sound, excellent visuals, brilliant acting, and the elements of horror to create a suspenseful, frightening experience.",Frankenstein
515,LARRY-274,those eyes,8,3 May 2004,"my father saw this movie when he was seven years old, and told me it was the best horror film he had seen, i have had the opportunity to see it several times and it is still the only film that makes me want to sleep with the light on. true the story is short and has alot of holes but when you look into the monsters eyes it will send a chill down your back. great work old boris.",Frankenstein
516,cinemoide,It not has to do with the book! But people are mistaken in thinking that the film is still good as film.,1,12 July 2012,"First come the facts. Victor Frankenstein, the character became Henry Frankenstein. He went from being a scientist obsessed with defeating death to become a mad scientist. In the book has no Fritz, is a childhood friend Henry Clerval who will study in Ingolstadt with Victor, but he does not help Victor to create the creature. In the movie has no Captain Robert Walton. In the film the creature gains the brain of a murderer, and demonstrates a demented personality. In the book it is very smart and articulate, interested in literature and becomes smarter than Victor Frankenstein himself. The film shows the creature have at most 6 feet tall. In the book it has 8 feet tall. In the film the creature has a big head with boring hair licked touching the forehead, and bolts (or metal plates) strung around his neck. In the book it has longs hair, many scars by stitches (reminiscent of a patchwork mat), yellow skin, but no metal parts. There are so many glaring differences between the film and the book that if I make note of fidelity to the film would be a note below zero. But after seeing that there are about 200 films about Frankenstein, and the only faithful adaptation is a production made for TV by Hallmark in 2004, I decided not to tear the film because of loyalty. But watching the film as film. And honestly ... there is no way to praise this garbage. Well, I saw many reviews saying that despite all the difference between book and film, the film maintains the concept of the original work. You really sure that read the same book as me? The concept of the book is not the ""insanity of the human being,"" but the old quarrel between science and religion about what we are. Religion says that God made ​​us perfect, and with scientific advances in the late nineteenth century, Mary Shelley was horrified to see that things like galvanism could incite the mind to believe that science would be approaching the secrets of God. Despite coming from an atheist family, including her own husband Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley put the book details of her own personal life, which included a modest belief in God. The main concept of the book is to show that even with all the scientific advances, venturing into the unknown and ""play"" God may have a painful price. About the movie, the acting is basically what they were in the '30s, more theatrical than realistic, and this is not a problem. The problem is the way James Whale as rough guides the story. With moments that could very well be in a film of black humor, and others that could be basically a horror movie of its generation. It suggests that all this was done without intent. Boris Karloff's acting is good, but in the final scene in the windmill where the creature screams because of the flames, he seems a little girl (with all due respect). Now tell me, a monster with a mind deranged and murderous screaming like a girl? And the ""happy ending""? What's that? Excuse me, but if James Whale did something really great in his career, this thing was the sequel of Frankenstein: ""The Bride of Frankenstein."" I can not say more because I maxing out characters, but is more or less the impression I got to see this piece of crap! PS: Although the Branagh version is not faithful to the book (although some parts are faithful) it's very better than James Whale version in movie aspect. And yes, the version of Branagh manages to retain the concept of the book, even changing several things!",Frankenstein
517,treleke,One of the Best!!,10,17 December 2014,"1931's Frankenstein is probably my personal favorite out of all the Classic Universal Monster Movies. Everything about it is just so on point. The solid script, the eerie atmosphere, the great performances,the well made sets and of course horror legend Boris Karloff as Farnkenestein's Monster. With that said, this movie still has some flaws. Some of it can be slowly paced and of course, the biggest complain is that it isn't accurate enough to the book. Although I never read the book, i can understand why some people might get upset about this. But yeah, as you can see, there's not much to complain about. On top of that, Frankenstein is probably one ore most iconic movies of all time. One of the most memorable and iconic/famous moments is the ""It's alive!"" scene, and for good reason. It's chilling, suspenseful, atmospheric all topped by an amazing performance by Colin Clive. This scene has been parodied countless times. In cartoons, movies, comics, and even a breakfast cereal! But all and all Frankenstein is a Phenomenal film worth seeing for any monster/horror fan, or hell, just your average viewer.Bottom line, go check it out!",Frankenstein
518,gregjhogan,Oooh (not) scary!!,2,24 November 2005,"Maybe this was scary back in the day, but now it barely registers. The monster is more of a murderous drunk stumbling around the movie, and then he only kills 2 people. He ain't Jason. Plot contrivances, plot lapses, melodrama and lack of any character development make this a difficult movie to watch. Our introduction to the monster is especially humorous. He comes out of his stupor and proceeds to walk up the stairs (lucky guess?)to the living quarters of Dr. Frankenstein - backwards! This is clearly so we can be ""shocked"" when we see his face upon his turning round. We then get 2 cuts to close ups of his face. The action is pretty laughable too - blows are obviously missing their targets and the monster can be seen holding back to avoid actually hurting anyone.Nice historical artifact, but not sure its really watchable today.",Frankenstein
519,taurus52,The right film at the right time made by the right people.,10,31 August 2005,"When an inspired authoress like Mary Wollstoncraft Shelly writes a masterpiece, a great director like James Whale, a wonderful actor like Boris Karloff, a great cast of supporting veteran actors, and the makeup genius of Frank P. Pierce get together....you have a movie that becomes history, Americana, etc. It lives forever. Generations a hundred years from now will still watch it! The citizens of the 1930's needed a getaway from the horrible lives they were leading in the Great Depression.....Hollywood gave them the ""White Telephone"" films (where luxury and a rich lifestyle can be imagined by those who could not afford a piece of bread), and, they offered us great escapist fare: KONG, THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD! And, of course, the great Universal horror movies of that decade. These films were played to be serious dramas, not campy, gory stupidity like later ""horror"" films. They don't make them like that anymore.....",Frankenstein
520,Space_Oddity7,A though provoking and touching monition picture that helped lead Boris Karloff on the road of horror legends.,8,27 June 2006,"Brilliant. Genius. Maniac. A few words to describe Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who, along with his freakish sidekick Fritz (Dwight Frye), attempts to challenge the authority of even God: To animate the dead. His lovely wife Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his old professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), and his father Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr) all try to prevent try to prevent the hellish uprising, but even they cannot stop it. Soon, the monster is on the lose, and, to the horror of Frankenstein, terrorizing the countryside...What sets Frankenstein's monster apart from other Universal Monsters, such as the voluptuous Dracula, is that Frankenstein's monster is sympathetic, in the sense that he is a mere product of science, with a longing for human contact. Director James Whale presents science as a perversion of natural and Christian life, a prevision of death, a tyrant murder of the innocent, a separation of Christina marriage. Dr. Waldman, played by the late Edward Van Sloan, as the only exception, for he is a good man who He sacrifices his life trying to stop the monster.The performances by the now late cast are all very well. Colin Clive's intense performance is great. To see the true depth of his performance, view the scene where Dr. Waldman informs him of his mistake in brain theft. His face is one of up most doubt and concern, which quickly transforms into a face of over confidence. Brilliant. Mae Clarke fills the screen with a presence of vulnerability and innocence. Frederick Kerr adds great helps of humor as Baron Frankenstein, with quirky and wonderfully delivered lines, including his hardened belief that Henry is involved with another woman. Dwight Frye's performance as Henry's sidekick Fritz is eerie and quite a contrast to Colin Clive's proper character. The rest of the cast, including John Boles as Victor Moritz and Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman are all goodThe most notable performance, of course, has to be Boris Karloff as The Monster. Karloff's fame as a horror legend was build on his performance as The Monster. With a lack of dialog(Until the 1935 sequel, Bride of Frankenstein, that is), Karloff is limited in his performance. However, he takes full advantage, offering an array of unforgettable grunts and movements. Juxtaposed with some nifty make up effects(for the time) and director James Whale skill of showing just enough, but not to much, make for an unforgettable screen performance.By juxtaposing Gothic decay and modern science, Whale creates an untrusted and ironic tone, developed further by Arthur Edeson's cinematography and the lyricism of the writing.Wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed and crafted, ironic, thought provoking, and chilling to this day, FRANKENSTEIN remains a horror classic, one not to missed. If not for its ionic stance in film, see it for it's thought provoking themes and simplistic nature.8/10",Frankenstein
521,ellana_costa,terrible,3,22 May 2006,"this movie, although a great example of Hollywood Depression Escapism film, was terrible. Of course i am speaking as someone who has read the book and believe that it was an insult to change so much. This movie simply wanted to let the people of the America Depression escape from whats going on around them by making the characters as simple as possible. The do not give the monster a voice, because if you give something a voice, it might explain itself, and the creators obviously wanted this monster to be hated with no regard to the unfair treatment it was given. But wait! That unfair treatment was only really evident in the book itself, Victor Frankenstein (or Henry Frankenstein as he is called in this film) treats him kindly in the beginning of the film and it is instead this mystery assistant that treats him unfairly.This movie, although a great example of Hollywood Depression Escapism, was an insult to the original novel and had Mary Shelly seen this film, she would have been offended. Had i not read the book first, my thoughts may be different, but i have read the book and loved it.",Frankenstein
