0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not quite extraordinary, but still an absorbing tale of an unlikely friendship",8,6 October 2017,"'Victoria and Abdul' appealed to me straight away, being someone who likes-loves a lot of biopics, considers Judi Dench a national treasure and who has liked several of director Stephen Frears's films. While it is not a perfect film, let alone quite an extraordinary one, 'Victoria and Abdul' generally did not disappoint and tells the tale of an unlikely friendship very absorbingly.As indicated, there are a couple of things that don't quite come off successfully. There were instances to me where the knockabout comedy was a little too enthusiastically written and delivered, particularly in a few of the imperial members of the court and their attitudes (occasionally teetering on the near-patronising). Simon Callow has fun as Puccini, but the man is presented somewhat as a caricature that could have been toned down.There are also instances of the dialogue being a touch too modern, Bertie does have moments of clichéd dialogue that takes one out of the setting somewhat and borders close on making too much of a pantomime villain. 'Victoria and Abdul' has been criticised for the politics, the portrayal of the title characters and the portrayal of colonialism being too generous, or ""white-washed"", as pathetic as this may seem that wasn't as big a problem to me, being not as knowledgeable in those areas, regarding the characters the performances were too good for that to be considered a problem to me.However, 'Victoria and Abdul' has a lot going for it. It is a beautiful film visually, the cinematography has a warm glow and boasts hues that give off a nostalgic quality. The costumes and locations settings are vivid and sumptuous. Thomas Newman has shown many times that he can write hypnotic and understated scores that evoke rousing and emotive qualities, he brings those qualities fabulously here. Stephen Frears directs with a gentle touch and keeps things as lively and compelling as possible.Frears and screenplay writer Lee Hall (although as said the script is not always perfect) also do a good job balancing comedy and drama and making the characters interesting (even if some are more developed than others, personally found the titular characters very vividly depicted while a couple like Puccini are underdeveloped). Most of the comedy is genuinely funny, wonderfully mischievous and slyly pointed, particularly in the first half where some of the lines make one laugh out loud. The comedy is balanced beautifully with a more serious, but not jarringly so, second half that soars in pathos and emotion that does tug at the heart strings. The ending is very touching.Story-wise, this unlikely friendship and relatively unknown chapter in the relatively late stages of Victoria's life/reign is absorbing, going at a lively pace while maintaining a gentle and well balanced tone. The lack of depth is more than made up for in the sweet chemistry between Dench and Ali Fazal, the comedy and drama and that the film is uplifting and poignant in equal measure.Judi Dench as expected is magnificent, achieving an achingly vulnerable and spirited portrayal which helps make Victoria easy to relate to and remarkably real, despite any misgivings people have of how she is written in context in the story. Ali Fazal matches her very well, he is very charming and loyal and gives the character an intensity and gentle charisma, don't agree about him being too servile, too eager or overly wilful though can understand that for him being a little too twinkly.Michael Gambon and the late Tim Piggott Smith are very good too, and Callow has fun although Puccini doesn't quite work. Eddie Izzard has to work with the least flattering and one-dimensional depiction of Bertie Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) imaginable, but remarkably he fits well and gives everything to his performance, remarkably just about preventing the character from being too much of a pantomime villain despite how the role is written coming dangerously close (the dialogue doesn't always do him justice).Overall, absorbing if not extraordinary. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",Victoria & Abdul
1,SnoopyStyle,could be powerful,6,7 July 2018,"It's 1887 Agra, India. Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) is a clerk in the local jail. Due to his height, he is picked to present Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) with a mohur for her Jubilee. He is eager for the prestigious opportunity although the other presenter is the much shorter and angry Mohammed. During the ceremony, Abdul makes forbidden eye contact with the Queen and she is taken with the tall dark stranger. She befriends him and makes him her Munshi which raises the concern of the court especially the heir Bertie, Prince of Wales (Eddie Izzard).The idea of the legendary Queen being taught by an Islamic scholar is profound history. This could be powerful with good tension and high drama. To achieve that, the movie has to hit precisely with Abdul. To me, he's played as too childlike. There is a way to do excitement without being childish. It diminishes his character which makes his lies more childlike. He needs nobility which is only partly there. Judi Dench is obviously a great actress and playing the Queen is well within her range. There is a powerful scene with her professing her loneliness. It would be more powerful if the tone isn't so light. Director Stephen Frears is trying to be too cute by half. The cutesy touches combine to lighten the much needed darker tension.",Victoria & Abdul
2,Hitchcoc,Densch Steals the Show,8,13 October 2017,"This is a fictionalized account of an actual relationship between Queen Victoria and England and an Indian man who befriends her, becoming an adviser. While the story is probably greatly exaggerated, it tugs at our hearts. The old Queen, now in her eighties, is tired and bored with the role she needs to play. Our modern Elizabeth must have trouble attending all those public events, having to exude a persona. Anyway, Abdul brings light toe the darkness, much to the dismay of Bertie (the Prince of Wales and later Edward VII) and the other courtiers. Because his ways are so foreign and he doesn't fall into the sycophantic trap other must sustain, he becomes refreshing. Not that there aren't some pitfall. He withholds some information from the Queen at times (more lies of omission) and she feels betrayed. Classism is so dominant, particularly at this time in history with the breadth of colonialism in the British Empire that its ugly head is put forth time after time. Judy Densch is amazing as Victoria. She has all the angst of a person who sees no positives in her world, and then she sparkles as she begins to realize what life could offer. I don't know how accurate the portrayals are, but it is a delight and we would hope that much of it is true.",Victoria & Abdul
3,Horst_In_Translation,The Queen and I,6,8 October 2017,"""Victoria and Abdul"" is a British/American movie from this year (2017) that runs for 110 minutes and is the newest work by Oscar nominees Stephen Frears and Lee Hall, who adapted the novel this is based on. It is about the unlikely relationship (not sexual) between a man and a much older woman from very different social backgrounds. Sounds a bit like ""Harold and Maude"", but it is actually closer to ""Driving Miss Daisy"" I would say. The title of my review basically refers to the fact that the film starts and ends with the Indian man, but it is at least as much about Oscar winner Judi Dench's Queen Victoria, so both are lead without a doubt. Ali Fazal is probably only known to Bollywood fans at this point, but this film could change that. He holds his own well next to Dench most of the time, but you also need to say that his character is really not that challenging and in terms of performances it is all about Dench's. There's no way she will cruise through awards season like another Queen from a Frears film, but an Oscar nomination seems possible. The win is not an option though I think. Still Dench is without a doubt one of the biggest highlights here and she is hitting all the right notes from start to finish. I read a while ago she may be going blind, but it seems it is not true (luckily!) because otherwise she could not give performances like the one in here. Another thing that puts her character right in the middle of the film is that we only find out about crucial factors from Abdul's life like his marriage the very same time Victoria does.There is also a lot of comedy to this film and even if it is basically always the same like the people around the two not understanding how they can be this close, it never gets repetitive. But these ""comedy people"" also get crucial dramatic significance like Abdul's friend/colleague (and what happens to him at the end) or the people next to the Queen with their reference to treason actually that also results in Dench's maybe most spectacular acting moment when she talks about her potential incapacitation. Dench shines on many more occasions though and it's fitting her character comes first in the title. She is an actress that has really grown on me over the years and she was also tremendous in Steve Coogan's ""Philomena"" recently. But back to this one here: It is a film that delivers on many fronts, not just the acting, namely the historic component, i.e. references to actual events, the period piece factor, the comedy, the tragedy, the drama etc. Weak moments were very rare like the infertility/gonorrhea part or also the question why the other servant was not allowed back to India earlier with his health declining. But still the positive was way more frequent here and this film has at least as many great as weaker moments. So, as a whole, it ends up in the middle on a steadily strong level. A must-see for Dench fans, a good watch for everybody else too. Go check it out.",Victoria & Abdul
4,Prismark10,The Empress of India,5,24 June 2018,"Following on from Mrs Brown in 1997. Judi Dench reprises her role as an older Queen Victoria in the last years of her life but still infatuated with a maverick member of her household.This time one of the two servants, Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) presented to the Empress of India. Victoria becomes fascinated by the exotic Karim who no doubt embellishes his status and stories much to the chagrin of the monarchs advisers and other members of the staff. They are not happy with this foreigner taking so much of Victoria's attentions. Abdul becomes her spiritual advisor on all things Indian.The film is based on true incidents. What is known for certain is that a lot of the papers relating to Karim were burned after Victoria's death and it highlights the prejudice of the times.Stephen Frears adds panache and humour to a slight story but it is sumptuous to look at with the costumes and set direction but it lacks the poignancy of Mrs Brown from two decades earlier.",Victoria & Abdul
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Such a beautiful movie.,10,17 March 2018,"The first thing anyone will say after watching this movie is how utterly amazing Judi Dench is, and rightly so, she ones again dons the robes of Queen Victoria and gives a commanding performance as one of the most famous monarchs. A performance worthy of an Oscar, she is an actress with unrivalled talent. This film is so much more then Dench's performance, spellbinding though it was.Ali Fazal, also worthy of accolades and awards, for his superb performance as Indian servant Abdul Karim. His performance is actually rather captivating, The Queen was taken under his spell and as a viewer so was I. Such an intriguing, fascinating character, probably unlike any other man she'd ever encountered.Superb production values throughout, the film was visually dazzling, sumptuous settings, jaw dropping costumes, this was a treat for the senses.A film is meant to move, and allow for escapism, when it can educate as well, it's worth of the elevated sore of 10/10.Absolutely loved it.",Victoria & Abdul
6,jboothmillard,Victoria & Abdul,8,17 August 2018,"We had already seen the lead actress play the famous British monarch very successfully in Mrs. Brown, this was the movie that saw her take on the role again, directed by Stephen Frears (Prick Up Your Ears, Dangerous Liaisons, Mrs Henderson Presents, The Queen, Philomena, Florence Foster Jenkins). Basically in 1887, young prison clerk Abdul Karim (Bollywood star Ali Fazal) from Agra, India is instructed to travel to England for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria (Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench) to present her with a mohur, a gold coin which has been minted as a token of appreciation from British-ruled India. The Queen, who has been lonely since the death of her husband Albert, is tired of her fawning courtiers, but develops an interest in and later a friendship with Abdul. She spends time with him alone, and promotes him to become her Munshi, her teacher for her to learn his native Urdu language and the Qur'an. Victoria is surprised to learn that Abdul is married, so invites his wife and mother-in-law to join him in England, they wear black Burqas, which alarms the staff of the household. While Victoria treats Abdul as a son, her favouring of him is resented by her household and inner circle, including her son Bertie, Prince of Wales (Eddie Izzard) and the Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury (Sir Michael Gambon). The household plots to undermine their relationship, hoping that Abdul will be sent home. When Victoria embarrasses herself by recounting details of the Indian Mutiny that Abdul had told her, Victoria's faith and trust in him are shaken and she decides he must go home. But the following day she changes her mind and asks him to stay, she gives Abdul a bejewelled locket with her photograph. Victoria's interest in India grows, including food from the country, having a Durbar Room at her Isle of Wight home of Osborne House decorated in an Indian style, and hanging portraits of Indians in the House, and she says she intends to give Abdul a knighthood. The Prime Minister is insistent that the royal household must find a way to get rid of Abdul. They research Abdul's family background in India, they show Victoria a dossier showing that his family is more ordinary and poor than Abdul has told her. Victoria insists her doctor examine why Abdul's wife has not fallen pregnant, it is discovered that Abdul has gonorrhoea. The doctor rushes to tell the Queen, expecting her to be disgusted, but she remains loyal to Abdul and scorns her courtiers for plotting against him. Eventually the household decides that, if Victoria does not break with Abdul, they will all resign, also threatening to certify the Queen as insane. Victoria is angry about this treason, she summons the entire household to the Durbar Room and demands that anyone who wants to resign step forward, when none do so, she says she has decided not to give Abdul a knighthood, but to include him in her next honours list as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. When Victoria falls ill, she urges Abdul to return to India while she can still protect him, she warns him that the court will turn on him when she dies, but Abdul insists that he will stay with Victoria until the end of her life. Victoria dies in 1901, her son Bertie, now Edward VII, rejects Abdul, burning all the gifts and papers he has received from the Queen, and sends him and his family back to India, Abdul's wife manages to save the locket for him. Abdul is seen kneeling before a large statue of Queen Victoria in a garden close to the Taj Mahal, he talks to it and kisses its feet in respect, Abdul continued to live in India for the next eight years, until his death. Also starring Olivia Williams as Lady Churchill, Tim Pigott-Smith (in his final role) as Sir Henry Ponsonby, Four Lions' Adeel Akhtar as Mohammed, Paul Higgins as Dr. Reid, Fenella Woolgar as Miss Phipps and Simon Callow as Puccini. Dench gives a wonderfully strong performance, showing the vulnerable and spirited side of the monarch, Fazal is great as the friendly and enthusiastic Muslim newcomer who brings her out of her shell, and the other well-known faces do their part well as well. This is a little-known chapter in the final years of Queen Victoria's reign, an odd-couple friendship between a handsome servant and an isolated widow, with sharp humour and genuine emotion, a very well written comedic and dramatic script and superb costume and period detail, it is a fascinating and warm-hearted true story in the shadows of history, a fantastic biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Very good!",Victoria & Abdul
7,CinemaSerf,"Queen there, got the T-shirt....",6,1 December 2019,"Essentially, Stephen Frears has created a vehicle for Dame Judi Dench to, well, play herself.... Ali Fazal has some charm as the ""Munshi"" but this film is almost as processional in it's delivery as in the opening banqueting scenes. My favourite character - by far - is the little page boy at the start who runs around pell-mell repeating the orders given him at the top of his voice (""Soooooooooouuuuuuuuup""). Adeel Akhtar, Sir Michael Gambon and Tim Pigott-Smith contribute generously to this, but ultimately it is little more than Dame Judi re-delivering something she has already proved to be extremely adept at.The craft effort is superb, and this film does look gorgeous. Surprisingly, it didn't trouble the BAFTA juries at all.",Victoria & Abdul
8,neil-476,"Slight, but impressive",8,8 May 2018,"Abdul Karim and a colleague are imported from India to make a presentation to Queen Victoria. Long after Prince Albert and her friend John Brown died, the Queen is old, tired, depressed and bored, and the introduction of the Indian piques her interest: he becomes a Court favourite to the consternation and annoyance of her Head of Household, the Prime Minster, and her son and first in line for the throne. The film tells of their relationship and the background politicking against Karim up to Victoria's death and Karim's return to India.This film is, in many ways, a sequel to Mrs Brown, Judi Dench's 1997 first entry as Queen Victoria and, in some respects, treads similar ground as regards a friendship regarded by some as ""inappropriate."" This one is quite funny - the audience was frequently chuckling.The script is good and the cast are excellent with, of course Dench on particularly good form as the aged monarch. The story is true - ""mostly"", as it says at the start - and, if so, the behaviour of certain individuals after Victoria's death is reprehensible.Showings at my local (Isle of Wight) cinema were packed, what with location filming taking place at Victoria's holiday hideaway at Osborne House on the Island, and reactions from the mostly elderly audience were very positive. And I enjoyed it very much despite it not being my type of film.",Victoria & Abdul
9,evanston_dad,Safe and Dull Period Piece,5,6 February 2018,"A very nice but very dull movie about Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) and a friendship she strikes up with a visiting Indian servant.This is the kind of movie that you can walk out on for long periods of time, come back to, and still know exactly what's happening because everything is geared to being as unchallenging and transparent as possible. If you're terrified of having a thought of your own during a movie, this is the one for you. Dench is cranky and regal, the Indian servant is refreshingly articulate and human (but wait, aren't all Indians supposed to be savages?!!), and the British aristocracy are presented not just as jerks but as bumbling foolish jerks. We know who the bad English people are because they smirk directly into the camera and practically twirl their silent movie villain mustaches. At one point, after talking about traditional English cuisine, one Indian leans into another and proclaims the English to be savages for eating things like blood pudding. Get it? Because English people think Indians are savages, and now the Indians think the English are savages. Isn't that funny?!!""Victoria and Abdul"" is the kind of movie the Academy turns to when they need a fifth one to fill out their costume design category. Grade: C",Victoria & Abdul
10,ferguson-6,dame judi does it again,6,28 September 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Stephen Frears has enjoyed a long career by focusing on the interesting stories of people, rather than the salient specifics of history or politics. He received Oscar nominations for THE QUEEN and THE GRIFTERS, and helmed other crowd-pleasers such as MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS, PHILOMENA, HIGH FIDELITY, and FLORENCE FOSTER JENKINS. While purely entertaining movies are always welcome, it's important to note the filmmaker's approach when the story is entwined with historical importance. ""Based on real events  mostly"" is Mr. Frears' cutesy way of kicking off the film and asking us to enjoy the unusual story of connection between a Queen and a servant, and cut him some slack on the historical depth. For most of us, the real enjoyment will be derived from watching yet another standout performance from Oscar winner (and 7 time nominee) Dame Judi Dench as the longest-reigning monarch, Queen Victoria in her elderly years. It's a role she played twenty years ago in MRS. BROWN, and her relationship with John Brown (presented in that film) has some parallels to what we see here with Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal). Dame Judi is the rare actress who can capture both the loneliness and tiresome burden of six decades of rule and the re-invigorated woman we see learning a new language and new religion. She plays weary and spunky with equal believability.Victoria was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress of India, and in 1861 her beloved husband Prince Albert died. This film picks up in 1887 with the pomp and circumstance of the Golden Jubilee – a celebration of her 50 years of rule. The early scenes tease us with obstructed views, and the comedic element becomes quite obvious as we see her so carelessly slurping her soup at the formal lunch. Part of the celebration includes the presentation of an honorary coin by two Indians peasants Abdul (Fazal) and Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar), the first chosen because of his height, and the second as a last minute fill-in. Lee Hall (Oscar nominated for BILLY ELLIOT) wrote the screenplay based on the book by Shrabani Basu. The journals of Abdul Karim were only discovered in 2010, a hundred years after his death. Some of the less favorable moments of this era are mentioned, but most of the Queen's lack of knowledge or awareness is attributed to the ""boring"" reports from her advisers. This leads to some awkward moments later in the film regarding the Muslim mutiny and the subsequent Fatwa.Rather than dwell on history, the film prefers to focus on the unconventional friendship and the re-awakening of the Queen. Abdul becomes her ""Munshi"" – a spiritual adviser and her teacher of Urda and the Koran. As you would expect, this is all quite scandalous and frustrating for those such as Prime Minister Lord Salisbury (Michael Gambon), Lady Churchill (Olivia Williams), Victoria's son Bertie (Eddie Izzard), and the royal staff: Sir Henry (the recently deceased Tim Pigott-Smith), her physician Dr Reid (Paul Higgins), and her quivering maid Miss Phipps (Fenella Woolgar). There is even a comical sequence with the great singer Puccini (Simon Callow) as the Queen herself belts out the Gilbert and Sullivan song ""I'm Called Little Buttercup"". Balmoral, the Isle of Wight, and Windsor Castle are all part of the breath-taking scenery, while the absurdity of the royal status is viewed through the eyes of the Indian servants. Most of the focus is on Victoria's transformation from joyless, isolated monarch to the anything-but-insane (an Oscar worthy scene) and eager to engage elderly woman (one who has an entire era named after her) falling back in love with life as she fights off ""the banquet of eternity"". Come for the laughs and the performance of Dame Judi  just not for a history lesson.",Victoria & Abdul
11,HotToastyRag,Wonderfully acted,9,27 February 2021,"While the preview of Victoria & Abdul looks like a light comedy, it's in fact a touching drama with a few comic situations thrown in. Based on the true story of Queen Victoria (played by Judi Dench) and her companion Abdul Karim (played by Ali Fazal), the movie starts during the festival commemorating her Golden Jubilee. In the grand tradition of eating for only as long as the monarch eats, Judi enjoys scarfing up her plate and watching as others struggle to keep up before the dishes get taken away. Ali has been hired as a waiter to help represent England's Indian subjects during the Golden Jubilee, and even though he's expressly been told not to make eye contact with the queen, he can't resist.Instead of getting reprimanded, Judi takes an interest in him. His youthful enthusiasm and uncontrollable emotions are intriguing to her, and the more they talk, the more they develop a deep friendship. There is some sorrow in the plot, as Ali is treated poorly by others in the court. Those who fear his influence over the queen try to break the friendship up, but time and again Judi and Ali prove that a connection of the heart is more important than any villainous force. And time and again, you'll be reaching for your handkerchief to dab your eyes. This is a very heartwarming story, beautifully acted with lovely art direction and costumes. It's always sad to see great acting ignored by the Academy. Both leads deserved nominations, as both were tour-de-force performances.",Victoria & Abdul
12,gradyharp,'Life is like a carpet. We weave in and out to make a pattern.',8,25 December 2017,"Thanks to the investigative mind and writing of Shraibani Basu the journals of Queen Victoria - letters between the Queen and her Indian Munshi, Abdul Karim - have become public and the result is this richly colorful and tender film adapted form Basu's book by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Frears. Graced by the magical presence of Judi Dench and a strong cast the film addresses the late 19th century British position in the global empire, the racism present, friendship, and a significant amount of education about the differences between Muslim and Hindi citizens in India. Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) arrives from India to participate in Queen Victoria's golden jubilee. The young clerk is surprised to find favor with the queen herself. As Victoria (Judi Dench) questions the constrictions of her long-held position, the two forge an unlikely and devoted alliance that her household and inner circle try to destroy. As their friendship deepens, Abdul teaches Victoria Urdu and Indian customs and philosophy and the queen begins to see a changing world through new eyes, joyfully reclaiming her humanity.The supporting cast is strong (though none of the characters are likeable!) and includes Olivia Williams, Eddie Izzard, Adeel Akhtar, Paul Higgins, Simon Callow, Tim Pigott-Smith, Fenella Woolgar and others. The cinematography is by Danny Cohen and the musical score by Thomas Newman.A very entertaining and in many ways enlightening film, so very well pulled together by the performances by Judi Dench and Ali Fazal.

13,malcolmgsw,judi dench is marvelous,9,18 September 2017,This has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year.Judi Dench is peerless as Queen Victoria.She is the queen personified.We can see that whatever understanding that she has of her Indian subjects will pass with her and that the ingrained attitudes will eventually lead to Independence and loss of Empire.A really excellent film.,Victoria & Abdul
14,JamesHitchcock,The Loneliness of Power,6,22 September 2017,"First we had ""Mrs Brown"", a film about the real-life relationship between Queen Victoria (played by Judi Dench) and one of her servants. And now we have ""Victoria & Abdul, another film about the real-life relationship between Queen Victoria (played by Judi Dench) and one of her servants. The subject of the first film was the Scottish ghillie John Brown, whose friendship with the Queen proved controversial because it gave rise to rumours that the two were having a sexual relationship and even that they were secretly married (hence the title). I don't think anyone believed that Victoria had married her Indian-born servant Abdul Karim- nobody ever called her ""Mrs Karim""- but their relationship was nevertheless controversial. In an age when the supremacy of the white race was widely taken for granted, many British people would have regarded a close friendship between their Queen and an Indian, especially an Indian of humble social origins, as quite inappropriate.The film relates how in 1887, the year of Victoria's Golden Jubilee, Abdul Karim, a clerk from Agra, was one of two Indians selected to present her with a medal on behalf of the Indian Government. By the Queen's wish the two men remained in England as her servants and a close relationship grew up between her and Karim after she asked him to teach her Urdu (or, as she referred to it ""Hindustani""). He became her confidant and she gave him the title ""Munshi"", meaning ""teacher""; this was a reference not merely to his role as a teacher of Urdu but also implied that he was, in some sense, her philosophical and spiritual guide as well. (She was deeply impressed by his devotion to his Muslim faith). His closeness to the Queen, however, made him unpopular both with the senior members of the Royal Household (who resented the fact that a man they regarded as their inferior was being treated as their equal) and by the servants (who resented the fact that a man they regarded as, at best, their equal was being treated as their superior). Karim was also disliked by Victoria's son Bertie, the future Edward VII, and as soon as the old Queen died he was shipped back to India on the new King's orders.Much of the criticism of the film has been political rather than artistic; director Stephen Frears has been accused of whitewashing colonialism and of depicting Abdul Karim as excessively servile. Yet it is a matter of historical record that Victoria was deeply attached to Karim and deplored any attempt to denigrate him, and indeed Indians in general, on account of their race or skin colour. The film's depiction of her as a sort of proto-anti-racist is therefore, to some account, historically accurate. And as for allegations that Ali Fazal played Karim as ""too servile"", he was, after all, a servant. It would have been very unwise for him to have treated the Queen, who was both his employer and his sovereign, in anything other than a deferential manner.One might well ask why, if Queen Victoria was an anti-racist, she was happy to reign over an Empire founded upon the idea that all men are not created equal and that the white races had the duty to export, if need be by force of arms, their supposedly superior civilisation to other parts of the world. That would be a good question; all I can say is that the Victorian age did not see, as our age sees, a contradiction between a belief in the moral rightness of the British Empire and the belief that one should treat individual members of other races with the same courtesy and respect that one would extend to Europeans. The standard ""white man's burden"" justification for imperialism strikes us as being at best patronising and at worst hypocritical. At the time it did not necessarily strike people in the same way.There are a few historical errors. In a scene set in 1887, Liliuokalani is described as ""Queen of Hawaii""; in that year she was still a Princess and did not become Queen until 1891. Victoria, who was regularly kept briefed by her ministers and who had access to government papers, would have been a lot more knowledgeable about the causes of the Indian Mutiny than she is shown here. Giacomo Puccini, born in 1858, would have been much younger in the 1890s than the character played here by the 68-year-old Simon Callow. By the time he became King, Edward VII was nearly bald; Eddie Izzard shows him with a full head of hair. The representation of the film's central theme, the Victoria/Abdul relationship, however, seems to be relatively accurate.As with ""Mrs Brown"", one of the film's main themes is the loneliness of power. The two films explore the thesis that, having lost her beloved husband relatively early in life, Victoria needed to form intense, if platonic, friendships with other men to support her in her immense responsibilities. I didn't think that the film was quite as good as ""Mrs Brown"", if only because Fazal never makes him quite as strong an individual as Billy Connolly did with his portrayal of John Brown. Some of the supporting cast, Callow being the worst offender, tend to play their parts as caricatures. Probably the best is Izzard. Some have complained that his portrayal of the Prince of Wales as a bad-tempered bigot is at odds with the image of Edward VII as a well-loved monarch, but I have long suspected that, beneath the façade of avuncular geniality which his subjects saw ""Bertie"" was actually a rather unpleasant individual. Dench, however, lives up to her normal high standards, making Victoria a regal figure but also bringing a measure of both humour and pathos to her portrayal. She shows us the woman as well as the Queen. 6/10",Victoria & Abdul
15,blanbrn,A touching story of friendship and understanding.,7,15 October 2017,"""Victoria and Abdul"" is one of those movies that you watch and the story grows on you. True it may not be the most entertaining yet it's a journey of discovery and an international look at culture and emotions.Set in the 1900's India wants to feel right and make some freedom and peace with England so a clerk named Abdul(Ali Fazal) is chosen to go meet the queen of England that being Ms. Victoria(played in top form and near perfection by Judi Dench)and he gets to know her well and a nice and surprise friendship is formed.Overall the film is a journey of culture and learning about one another with the ups and downs of life it still proves that friendship is possible and common for all and that memories and love last for all no matter what country a person is from.",Victoria & Abdul
16,lasttimeisaw,Woe betide those who sabotage Dench's tailor-made crowning piece,6,17 December 2017,"Taking a revisionist tone of ridiculing British monarchy's inner circle, riddled with ingrained racism, snobbish abomination and unrelieved hostility towards Abdul Karim (Fazal), the Indian munshi (native language teacher) of Queen Victoria (Dench) and her confident, yet also repeatedly showing Abdul's blind subservience (kissing the Queen's foot) to appease the backlash of colonialism, Stephen Frears' period drama VICTORIA & ABDUL seems to enmesh itself within a mean-spirited conundrum, where should we put the toehold of our sympathy? Victoria or Abdul? Either, perhaps.Exactly two decades after John Madden's MRS. BROWN (1997), Dame Judi Dench reprises the role which has kick-started her unprecedented and unparalleled silver-screen surge when she was mere a sexagenarian, it would only be too perfect for the film to scoop her a second Oscar which she truly deserves (so that she can finally be abreast with another Dame Ms. Smith in terms of Oscar glory). Her performance here is both as one expects, stately, lucid-minded and poignantly heads-turning, but there is also something quite unexpected, the loneliness, world-weary pathos of a senile monarch, who doesn't have one single ally in her regal domicile and perennially encircled by lackeys, fussbudgets and a son hot to trot of her throne, which makes an accountable excuse for her last petulance. Frears makes sure it is Dench's star vehicle first and foremost, dutifully hits every rung of character arc to flesh out a ruler's physical atrophy, mental slackness (her ignorance of Indian Mutiny is appalling for her position), dignified resilience and heartfelt elation all cloistered in the immurement concomitant with power, duty and all those exterior glamorous trimmings. The ""I'm anything but insane"" reprimand segment could be her Oscar-clip but she must fight tooth and nail to get that nomination in the cutting-throat Oscar race, especially her chance is significantly undercut by the film's below-par status as a serious awards contender. Another defective factor is the characterization of Abdul, which abhorrently pales in comparison as if he is just a piece of exotica, good-looking enough to catch Queen's weary eyes, to say nothing of the thinly-veiled racism through the gonorrhea placement, which is as horrid the one-noted attribute of the repugnant household. Woe betide those who fail to live up to Dench's first-class craft, including the screenwriter Lee Hall and the journeyman Stephen Frears, the unwitting saboteurs of an 84-year-older's tailor-made crowning piece.",Victoria & Abdul
17,sddavis63,A Fine Performance By Judi Dench In A very Interesting And Enjoyable Movie,9,28 January 2018,"In many ways, Victoria & Abdul feels almost like a sequel to 1997's ""Mrs. Brown"" - including the fact that Queen Victoria was played in both by Judi Dench. Dench was predictably superb in the role - it's not wrong to suggest that this was a role that she was born to play - and I have to say that while I enjoyed ""Mrs. Brown,"" I actually thought that for a variety of reasons this was the better of the two movies. In spite of that fact this movie at times came across as light-hearted (perhaps a tinge of comedy-drama to it) it also, to me, seemed to have more depth to it - especially its sometimes under-stated but always very present reflection on British colonial attitudes toward India and race.Like ""Mrs. Brown,"" ""Victoria & Abdul"" focuses on a most unlikely friendship. This is set late in Victoria's reign. She is elderly and she is lonely. She's been a widow for a long time (her beloved Albert having died almost 30 years before), she's largely estranged from her children and she's surrounded by courtiers and politicians but not friends. She's literally dragged out of bed every morning by her servants - and she's miserable; an old woman simply waiting to die. And into the midst of that comes Adbul Karim (played by Ali Fazal.) Brought to England to present a ceremonial Indian coin to the Queen, the two somehow strike up a friendship, and Abdul becomes almost like a son to her and becomes very committed to her in return. The movie doesn't really make clear what drew them to one another - which is perhaps appropriate, because the tension of the movie is the inability of everyone around her to understand why this relationship has developed. The best answer might be simply that Victoria needed someone, and one of Dench's masterful bits of work in this movie is her portrayal of the difference Abdul made in Victoria's life. Without Adbul, Dench presents Victoria as tired, disinterested, miserable - waiting to die basically. But with Abdul, Dench transforms the character into one that's alive and vibrant and curious - and enjoying her life. It was a very good performance. We can become too consumed by wanting an ""explanation"" and forget to simply celebrate the power of the connection the two developed. As Abdul rises (eventually Victoria names him her ""munshi"" - spiritual teacher - much to the chagrin of her court because he's a Muslim and she's the head of the Church of England) the court turns on both him and her because of the relationship.Unlike ""Mrs. Brown"" - which was interesting but had few real issues of substance to it - ""Victoria & Abdul"" does actually deal with real issues - especially the British attitude toward India and its people. It was often considered the crown jewel of the British Empire, and Victoria was delighted when she was granted the title of ""Empress of India"" (by Disraeli in the 1860's mind you and not by the people of India.) And yet the overwhelming British attitude toward Indians was racism and toward India was ignorance - attitudes shared by Queen Victoria, who knew nothing of this place she was so proud to be Empress of. India was another bit of pink (the colour always used for many years to denote the countries of the British Empire) on the map of the world to be exploited for the mother country. There are various ways in which this is pointed out - one of the best being the insistence of the British to refer to Abdul and his friend Mohammed (who made the journey to England with him) as ""the Hindus"" even though they were Muslim. The Queen's loneliness and isolation is also highlighted. There are a variety of ways of doing so. It's clear that she has a huge family - at her deathbed stands Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany (with whom Britain will be at war in less than 20 years) and who was actually Victoria's grandson. She is constantly surrounded by servants who take care of her every need. She is constantly speaking to politicians. But she's essentially alone. We may not know what caused her to bond with Adbul, but it's not hard to understand why she needed to bond with someone. In the end, the bond represented a threat to those around Victoria - especially her son and heir Bertie (who would become King Edward VII when she died) and who, upon his accession to the throne, finally gets his revenge on Abdul.This is a very well done movie. The performances are first rate, the story is interesting, the attempts at humour work. It drew me in and held me for its entire run time. (9/10)",Victoria & Abdul
18,MOscarbradley,This goes down a treat.,8,19 September 2017,"Last year it was ethnicity that dominated the Oscars and this year it could well be longevity. I recently predicted that, at the age of 91, Harry Dean Stanton could be Oscar's oldest ever Best Actor and even now there is every chance he will be posthumously nominated while Dame Judi, a mere 82, should have no worries in being a sure-fire contender for her performance as Queen Victoria in ""Victoria & Abdul"". It's a part she has already played in ""Mrs. Brown"", (losing out to Helen Hunt in ""It's As Good as it Gets""), and to be fair, this is something of a walk in the park for her.We are told the movie is 'mostly' based on actual events but I think we have to take a lot of what we see with a pinch of salt. It's certainly an entertaining picture, if a little twee and whimsical at times, but there is also a little more heft to it than meets the eye. As written by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Frears this is no mere sentimental, historical romp. It is, of course, the story of the Queen's friendship, in the years before her death, with her Indian servant Abdul Karim, (Ali Fazal, an actor new to me), which until recently was something kept very much under wraps and which was very much opposed to by the Prime Minister, her son the Prince of Wales and the entire royal household and Hall makes this another post-Brexit movie, (I have a feeling we are going to see a lot of post-Brexit movies in the next few years).What we have here is a film about racism and about empire and it's quite as relevant today as it was back in Victoria's time. Not that you have to take it too seriously; there's a lot of low comedy on display and Frears has assembled an outstanding cast of British character actors. Eddie Izzard is an obnoxious future king, the late Tim Piggot-Smith is quite wonderful as the toadying head of the household, Michael Gambon is the befuddled Prime Minister and Paul Higgins practically walks off with the picture as the Queen's concerned doctor; concerned, not with her health, but with the number of Indians about the place. As a piece of film-making there is, naturally, a large dose of Masterpiece Theatre on display but that, in itself, isn't such a bad thing. ""Victoria & Abdul"" goes down a treat.",Victoria & Abdul
19,dromasca,an impossible love story,5,25 September 2017,"The history of England was blessed with several famous queens - starting with head-losers Anne Boleyn and Mary Stuart, continuing the two Elisabeth's and of course Queen Victoria, the record holder of longevity until recently, the queen who gave her name to a whole era of maximal glory and expansion of the British Empire. The big dames of English cinema were accordingly blessed with the respective fabulous roles that they love to bring to the big screens and are regarded as peaks of their careers. For Dame Judi Dench, Victoria and Abdul directed by Stephen Frears provides (for the second time actually) the opportunity to create a memorable portrait of Victoria. Her success in completing this task is the best part and the best that can be said and written about this production. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that can be said and written about this film.It's very difficult to disconnect the historical episode of the relationship between the old widow who was also the queen of the largest empire on earth at her time (and maybe at all times) and the Muslim servant from India who raised to become her secretary, counselor, spiritual adviser, friend, surrogate son and maybe more than all these, and the political situation today, 120 years later, when the divided Britain faced with the realities of globalization and immigration tries to put again sea and borders between her and Europe. The authors of the film invested quite a lot in describing the atmosphere of the imperial households and its corridors of power and gossip with the adequate costumes and decoration but they are talking all the time to the contemporary spectator while telling a story based on real history or facts as they happened ... or almost, as they cautionary and wisely warn us in the opening.We are thus left with an impossible friendship and even love story, impossible because of a mountain of reasons: class differences, race prejudices, age gap, cultural and historical precipices. The only thing that can save such a film from falling in complete melodrama or faked rhetoric is the human dimension. In Victoria and Abdul this dimension is only partially delivered by the splendid acting performance of Judi Dench. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast cannot come even close to her class. Ali Fazal is fit physically but lacks the nuances that can explain some of the contradictions of his personality. We never know or really understand what is his real class background, whether the deepness of his knowledge in the Quran and oriental culture is genuine, or if he intentionally misled his beloved queen in the details of the history and realities of the inter-faith conflicts on the Indian continent. The rest of the cast is condemned to represent a gallery of half-ridiculous, half-perverse characters representing the British aristocracy class full of prejudice and bad faith. If only the caricature would have been pushed a little further we could have had more comical fun, but Stephen Frears could not really abandon the ambition of passing some important message about today's politics. In my opinion he failed, and the principal great merit of this film is telling a half-baked potential love story while allowing Judi Dench to add another great role to her illustrious filmography.",Victoria & Abdul
20,westsideschl,Engaging,8,20 January 2018,"Possible negatives: 
1. First scenes shows a British soldier's rudeness in an accidental bumping into an Indian in a crowded street. Not exactly a balanced (or perhaps even an overall generalized) representation of Brit behavior in India to ""low"" caste Indians. Who knows? 
2. Brit elite portrayed as gluttonous, status conscience, environment destroying, self-serving humans. Might fit most peoples at that time (and a certain President today). 
3. If all Muslims are that courteous and thoughtful as portrayed then I'm converting. 
4. Story based on memoirs of Abdul Karim discovered in 2010, but this is a movie meant to entertain (capture) audience attention so some allowance should be given to embellishments. For amusement on this read the one star ratings. 
Positives:
1. Sets, costumes, cinematography all ""Downton Abbey"" first class.

21,tabuno,Full of humorous and light-hearted playfulness,8,27 January 2019,"Judi Dench headlines this period drama that is full of humorous and light-hearted playfulness mostly at the expense of the stodgy English Royal Household. Supposedly based on the 2010 memoirs of Queen Victoria's Indian Servant, this movie is replete with surprising low and high class intricacies that lay onto of a more subtle darker simmering foundation of English class prejudice. The are some very touching moments with the Queen, especially in her isolated moments. There is also an unspoken and overlooked issue regarding the English rule of Indian that is scattered throughout the movie that can raise some questions about the integrity and the extent of the veracity of the depiction of Queen Victoria and her servant and later teacher (there just happens to be a qualifying statement at the beginning of the movie to the dramatical discretion taken in the script. Overall, this movie is both playful, entertaining, and sobering that avoids some of the harder gripping drama portrayal of the times and historical figures (especially as advertised in the movie's trailer).",Victoria & Abdul
22,Red-125,"She was Empress of India, but she knew very little about her Empire",9,25 October 2017,"Victoria and Abdul (2017) was directed by Stephen Frears. It stars Dame Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, and Ali Fazal as Abdul Karim, her servant and (later) her teacher and friend.The movie is based on a true friendship that blossomed between Queen Victoria and Abdul Karim. If it weren't true, no one would go to see the movie, because they would say that the whole notion was preposterous. However, it did happen, again showing us that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.Dame Judi was meant to play Queen Victoria. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if director Frears had her in mind for this role right from the start. Ali Fazal is a well-known actor in India, and he also performs very well. (In my opinion, the supporting actors did a good enough job with the roles they were given, but they were mostly interchangeable stereotypes.)Everything depended on the chemistry between the two leads, and it was definitely there. The story is fascinating, the costumes are extraordinary, and the film moves forward with a fast pace.We saw Victoria and Abdul at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. This is a movie that will work better on the large screen, so, if it's not too late, try to see it in a theater. It's still worth seeing on the small screen, if that's your only option.Note that this movie has an anemic IMDb rating of 6.9. I don't understand this. It's much better than that.",Victoria & Abdul

Judi Dench who plays Queen Victoria always puts on a good performance and actor Ali Fazal who plays her East Indian born Munshi paired well but the on screen chemistry between Queen and her faithful servant was less than impressive.I kept waiting for that one singular tearful on screen moment in the movie and even on her death bed when she called out for her Munshi it was shallow and non eventful. Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed the film and its attempt at presenting some factual historical moments during the latter years of Queen Victoria's reign with her Munshi from 1897 to 1901 but this film missed its mark.The on screen chemistry between Judi Dench and Ali Fazal fizzled early and I would relate it to a glass of beer that was all foam and with little beer.

25,paul-allaer,"Starts out as comedy, ends up as drama",6,25 October 2017,"""Victoria & Abdul"" (2017 release from the UK; 112 min.) brings the story (""based on true events... mostly"", we are reminded at the beginning, of the unlikely friendship between Queen Victoria and Indian Muslim Abdul. As the movie opens, we are in ""Agra 1887"", as we get to know Abdul, who works in the British Governor's Office. Abdul and one other man are selected by the Governor to participate in the Queen's Golden Jubilee and present her with a ceremonial coin. It's not long before these two are on their way to London. Meanwhile, we see the Queen in her daily (and mostly grumpy) routine. At the Jubilee dinner, Abdul, even though he was instructed not to make eye-contact, does so anyway... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from veteran British director Stephen Frears, who just last year brought us ""Florence Foster Jenkins"". Here, Frears brings to the big screen the unlikely friendship between the most powerful woman in the world at that time, and an ordinary man from India. The first part of the movie is more funny than serious (the awkward adaptation to the British life style, etc.) and at times feels a but light-weight. That changes in the second part of the movie (for reasons I obviously will not spoil). Judy Dench, who is now a crisp 82 years young, gives another fine performance as Queen Victoria (reprising the role she first played in ""Mrs. Brown""), bringing the Queen's loneliness and sadness colorfully to the screen (""Albert's been gone for 30 years, and I think of him every day"", she laments to Abdul). The photography is eye-candy from start to finish, check out in particular the scenes in Scotland and Florence, Italy. All that said, when a movie opens with the disclaimer ""Based on real events... mostly"", to me that translates as ""we have taken major liberties with how things really happened, so that we could bring you this particular movie"". From the looks of it, the ""British Empire"" was mostly benign as it relates to the Indian subcontinent. But was that really so? ""Victoria & Abdul"" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens a few weeks ago. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (at first it looked dismal, then at the last second a large group of women, at least 10 of them, walked in). If you like historical biopics, you are the target audience for this movie, and I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion..",Victoria & Abdul
26,Turfseer,Judi Dench shines as a depressed Queen Victoria who finds meaning in life through a relationship with an unlikely confidant,7,16 June 2018,"Before Shrabani Basu's book of the same name, the story of the relationship between a Muslim Indian servant by the name of Abdul Karim and Queen Victoria, was basically lost to history. By chance while on a family trip to Victoria's holiday home, Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, Basu noticed a painting of Abdul and wondered who he was. Her research led her to discovering Abdul's journal which was still in his family's hands since his death in 1909. 
Abdul, a low-level civil servant in the prison system, hailed from Agra, India. He was invited to Buckingham Palace to present a coin commemorating British rule over India, for Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887 along with a co-worker Mohammed, decidedly anti-British in his outlook. 
Abdul (portrayed as a gentle soul here) has no such objections to paying tribute to Victoria and is excited to be invited to the Palace. The courtiers instruct him to be obsequious when he meets Victoria and he is specifically told not to look directly at the Queen. He however defies their instructions and somehow Victoria takes notice of him. Before you know it, Victoria insists that Abdul remain at the Court as her ""Munshi"" (teacher). 
Much to the chagrin of her son Bertie (later to become King Edward) and the other stuffed shirts at the Palace, Abdul is revealed to be not a Hindu (as originally believed by those who invited Abdul to England), but actually a Muslim. Soon Abdul is teaching Victoria Urdu and passages from the Qur'an. When she finds out he's married, she has him bring his wife and mother-in-law to live at the Palace. 
The film succeeds on two fronts. First the deep-seated animosity of Victoria's family and friends toward Abdul leads to the central conflict in which Victoria's affection for her ""Munshi"" is directly challenged. At one point the entire staff threatens to resign over Victoria's declaration that she plans to have her confidant knighted. Underlying all of this is the implication that British society at the time was guilty of endemic racism. Victoria is held up as a model and champion of liberalism, willing to defend a ""lowly servant,"" condemned by British society based on his perceived inferior station in life. 
Victoria may not have been completely a shining beacon, championing the downtrodden immigrants of her time, but her small gesture of friendship toward Abdul here suggests she was certainly much more progressive than many of her contemporaries. What's more, it's recorded in her writings that she was aware that Abdul may have been subject of ""race prejudice,"" which (she writes) accounted for the outright hostility against him. 
More important is how the relationship helped Victoria in her old age, after she endured the death of her beloved husband years earlier, along with the friendship later on, with the Scottish manservant, John Brown. The gentle Abdul kept her engaged in the world after she withdrew due to the depression over the death of her husband. 
While Judi Dench is magnificent as a complex Victoria, Ali Fazal as Abdul is saddled by a script that puts the teacher on a pedestal and reduces him to a one-dimensional good guy. Abdul's dark side is suggested but never explored in detail. It makes sense that Victoria would become angry with him after relying on his account of the Indian mutiny of 1857 (in which hundreds of British troops were massacred by Muslims following a ""fatwa"" issued by a prominent Iman). Perhaps there needed to be some additional dialogue explaining Abdul's position-why he put that particular spin on the story that distorted what had actually occurred (could it have been that he was actually ignorant of the true facts of the massacre and was subject to the propaganda of his fellow Muslims back in India?).
 Another event also remained unexplored-this is when the Court physician reveals the saintly Abdul actually suffers from gonorrhea which accounted for the fact that his wife had no children. Again, Victoria ignores Abdul's potential dark side when she curtly orders her physician to heal him of his affliction. What does Abdul have to say about this development? We never find out. 
Finally, history tells us that Abdul actually campaigned to have himself knighted; the film suggests otherwise-that it was solely Victoria's idea. Had the film's scenarists chosen to depict events in this way, Abdul wouldn't have come off as such a goody two-shoes. 
Nonetheless, the denouement is sad. Following Victoria's death, Abdul was unceremoniously sent packing and all papers relating to his stay at Court, were burned upon orders of Victoria's son, the new King. Despite Abdul's shortcomings, the Royal Family failed to recognize that Abdul was actually good for Victoria, and helped her cope while she was undergoing a deep depression. In short, they should have ""worked something out,"" but given the times, this was an impossibility. 
Director Stephen Frears does an excellent job sustaining our interest in a story that could have easily become lugubrious. The production design is excellent, aptly giving us a real feel for the times. More could have done with Abdul's character, but Judi Dench steals the show as a Queen who found meaning in life through a friendship with an unlikely confidant!",Victoria & Abdul
27,jamesrupert2014,Unconvincing semi-historical dramedy,5,19 January 2020,"In 1887, a pair of mismatched Indian men are sent to England to present Queen Victoria with a tribute as part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations. The elderly Queen takes a liking to one of the men, and soon appoints him as her 'Munshi' (teacher), much to the consternation and anger of her courtiers and family. The story behind this unlikely relationship is fascinating (I have not read the source book by Shrabani Basu) but the film tries too hard to mould the story to fit modern 'progressive-liberal' values, and the whole undertaking ends up looking forced and phony. Victoria had ruled the most powerful, extensive Empire the world had ever seen for 50 years, but the film implies that she had no idea how the Empire was maintained, the provenance of the 'spoils' of colonialism (then not a 'bad word') she possessed, or the major events that occurred during her reign (such as the Sepoy Mutiny). The film's Victoria appears as doddering elderly women who only takes an interest in life when an intriguing foreigner appears (the film suggests that it was Abdul Karim's good looks that first caught her attention, which isn't really supported by contemporaneous photos). As the film-makers were likely loathe to be accused of 'whitewashing' colonial history (a big risk with the audience at whom the film was targeted), they make up for the Queen's liberal, colour-blind, love of diversity and tolerance by making everyone else in the royal household superficial, venal, and/or stupid. Dame Judi Dench is as good as always as the aged Queen-Empress but Ali Fazal makes for a bland, saintly 'Munshi', largely because the filmmakers seem intent on making the character into a stereotypical 'wise Oriental mage'. The 'truth is stranger than fiction' story of the bond between the most powerful women in the world and an obscure Indian civil-servant deserved better, more honest and less fanciful treatment, but at least the film-makers were forthright: the opening screen shot states ""Based on real events... mostly"".",Victoria & Abdul

34,rannynm,Mind-Boggling Story Revealing the Racism of the Times,9,24 September 2017,"This incredible, historical film opened my eyes and made me better understand the world I live in. Given that racism is still a prevalent issue in today's society, it was mind-boggling to see it in Britain, at the turn of the 20th century. I admire how this film brings the past to the present, and made me question how racism can dissipate in the future. This film carefully documents the relationship between Queen Victoria and her beloved servant, Abdul Karim. Queen Victoria reigned in the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1901. She was the longest serving monarch in world history. In addition to being a queen, she was also the Empress of India. Because of this, Abdul Karim and his friend Mohammed are sent from India to Britain to deliver a sacred coin: the Mohur. Abdul and Mohammed believe they are only going to remain in Britain for a short period of time, but they end up going on the adventure of a lifetime. Judi Dench, who plays Queen Victoria, exceptionally portrays a queen who is tired of her constriction. All she wants to do is have Abdul be her full- time servant, but because of his origins, Queen Victoria's staff does not approve. Ali Fazal, who plays Abdul Karim, considers the queen a very special person and his kindness towards her is impeccable. He teaches her the Quran and shares his culture with her. As time goes on, both develop a strong friendship, which is truly heartwarming. The setting is remarkable. I've never seen the Taj Mahal, Scotland or the queen's palace. This film takes the audience to all these places. After seeing the beauty in other countries, it makes me want to travel the world. My favorite part of this film is when Queen Victoria eats with her staff. She eats very quickly and, once she finishes her food, regardless if the others are done or not, the servants take all of the food away. It's hilarious to see people still eating their meals and have their food taken away in the blink of an eye. The message of this film is that no race, culture or religion is subordinate to another, even though individuals are from many different backgrounds. Britain is usually portrayed as one of the most powerful countries, but not in this film. We have to learn to not categorize others as inferior because of their lifestyle. Differences make society beautiful. If we were all the same, everything would be boring. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to kids ages 15 to 18 as well as adults. There are undertones of adult subject matter throughout the film. Queen Victoria is infatuated with much a younger, married man, which is why an older audience is more suitable for it.

35,Kingslaay,Great film and story,9,23 September 2017,"Victoria and Abdul was a truly enjoyable film. It is a story about the friendship between a monarch in her final days who outlived many dear ones and a genuine and religious soul who relished in her company. A simpleton who wished to serve and is full of life won the favor of the celebrated monarch who saw his true intentions and valued his heartfelt wishes. The bond has to be one of the most unusual as well as greatest friendships in history. The film is a treat to watch and showcases some great performances from the cast, especially the two leads. At the same time it is a window into an interesting and rich part of history. It shed light on events that were unknown till 2010 and quite fascinating to learn and watch.The soft and innocent friendship was enjoyable to watch from the dance scene to the walk shared in Florence. The film also had nice doses of humor hear and there to liven the film up. It was the meeting of two different worlds, on one side an aged ruler and on the other a low level simpleton who connected on a humane level. For a brief moment the queen and the audience forgot about Imperialism and colonisation. The end resembled a tragedy with the Queen dying and Abdul Karim being thrown out of England. The end with Abdul paying respects to his queen close to the Taj Mahal that he passionately told her about was a nice touch to end such a good film. 8/10",Victoria & Abdul
36,eric262003,Platonic Love At Its Best,7,31 July 2018,"""Victoria and Abdul"" centre around two people madly in love with each other while keeping it platonic and showing that love is not necessarily a physical thing but more affectionate emotion one has to the other. In this case it's on Queen Victoria and an Indian Muslim subject whom both seem to have a great connection for one another that was based on actual events under the direction of Stephen Frears and scriptwriter Lee Hall. Although the intentions were good in the making of the movie, it's still overwrought with stuffiness, lack of coherency and looking to find the right genre of the film. It can't decide if it wants to be a drama or a comedy. The drama level is on par with Queen Victoria's personnel along with the angst and irritability regarding the bonding between her majesty and this Indian servant. But the leading performances successfully managed to build a strong relationship even through the hostile intensity.Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) is an Indian servant living under the British crown and government. He is a commoner who's responsible for taking logs at a local prison. He becomes a presence to the Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) only due to his tallness and was told never to make eye contact with her. The one powerful Victoria is now in her 80's, bordering on senility, she's pudgy, and has become sick to death with the routines and the demands that has been part of most of her life. She eats in an uncouth manner and has lost a lot of etiquette and sleeps during important meetings. When Abdul offers her the gift for her, she gets awestruck by his handsome visage. She demands that he stays with her for a while and be by her side. She is also fascinated by his culture. His physical well being helps rectify her vitality while her close associates become infuriated by the day.The movie is a tale of two individuals who are not entire disconnected from one each other and relies on two plots. The first being the Queen's restoring of faith within the palace due to Abdul and the second being the people who are upset about this whole ordeal. The transformation from light comedy to darker territories can be quite revolting, though its still in conjunction to the development of the script but feels very indecisive in its direction to where it wants to go. The queen is in this stage in her life where everything to her seems pointless and once Abdul enters her life her energy is restored again like it was some miracle and that the subjects think it's all a phase and that she'll eventually lose interest in him. But the conflict in that assumption falls very flat. It has its moments of charm and a few areas of surrealism as well like in the second the primary focus is on Victoria's demands from the physicians to check out Abdul and his wife as to why she can't reproduce which falls in very dark and heavy-handed scenes. The film may spark some interest, but the awkward pacing and narrative will likely get you flabbergasted.When it comes to the technical aspects like the production design is brilliantly nuanced. The settings and location are visually stunning, the film does have that authentic look like you're stepping into 19th century England. The costumes were very fit for the period and the diversity that comes with the package is quite sublime. Frears' direction seems to be in confident hands with a combination of splendor and intimacy. In terms of lightness the chemistry between Victoria and Abdul is very adaptable and we can feel the passion one has for each other. However, the dark clouds reign here as well as the subject matter becomes overwhelmingly heavy. The performances were universally excellent. Judi Dench may have overdone makeup, but still generates a complex role quite flawlessly as she's plays senile while also displaying a light role mixed with darker and heavier themes. Ali Fazal show great depth in his role as the humble, lovable servant and shows that underneath all her majestic powers, he knows she's still human like the rest of us and knows she can find a friend in him.""Victoria and Abdul"" succeeds in many areas like acting, sets, costumes and production design. The direction of where it wants to go gets lost and though the first two acts were light in comedy, it turns to a more jarring, darker third act. I would recommend it to those who love period pieces and fans who of Judi Dench in these type of roles.",Victoria & Abdul
37,krocheav,Victoria and Abdul - Largely Fact or Mostly Fiction?,6,14 January 2019,"This movie is a treat for the eyes with gorgeous Scottish locations, stylishly detailed costumes, stately summer palaces, and consists of many professional performances. It's good to see Dame Dench give a strong performance following some by-the-numbers of late. It also holds the attention for most of its run time by offering a tell-tale story of a little known relationship between this long reigning Queen, with a randomly selected Indian - who was one of two 'local subjects' brought to England to present her with a specially minted gold coin - as token of appreciation from British ruled India. The close relationship that follows between her and one of the guest presenters tends to become perhaps a little too romanticised for the level of believability expected of its audience. Victoria's Burqa comments made at her first sight of Abdul's wife - seem far too 'fanciful' if not highly doubtful.It's more like a case of this older woman maybe being mesmerized by the mystical East or the BBC perhaps, following a mandate to sell a political message of Muslim cleansing to the British populace and the world. Either way there's a feeling that, at its core, maybe lays a major thread of PC manipulation. If you can brush this aside you'll enjoy a well-made tale of highly unusual interracial fascination but, there remain other odd facts to overcome. As head of the Church of England this Queen is allowed to slowly die - without a representative of her church being in attendance - highly suspect if this is being claimed as true!

To the displeasure of her court, the aging and lonely Queen finds friendship and compassion in a common man from India.I believe the thing that I liked best about this was how open minded the Queen was. Amid all the closed minded, rampant racism of the people who surrounded her, she looked beyond skin and status. She found someone who's company she enjoyed very much.I feel the ending of the film was sad but I enjoyed watching it. It was well filmed, costuming was great and the actors did a great job.

40,proud_luddite,Mixed Result,6,1 January 2018,"Based on true events: in 1887, celebrations mark the golden jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria (Judi Dench). Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) is an Indian working as a clerk in a prison in Agra. He and a fellow Indian are assigned to travel to London to be part of the celebration and present the queen with a ceremonial coin as a sign of India's ""appreciation"" of being occupied by Great Britain. An unexpected kinship develops between Victoria and Abdul - one that endures for years as Abdul is part of the royal staff - much to the chagrin and contempt of many others.A narrative of two main characters needs three items to develop from beginning to end: that of each of the two characters as well as their connection. In ""Victoria and Abdul"", only one of these feels developed by the end: Victoria's character.This is partly due to the fine performance of the always-reliable Dench who is regal in her own right as a performer and artist. While some of Victoria's beliefs and convictions are questionable (was she really the 'good white liberal' among a bunch of Neanderthals), the characterization does feel complete by the end.Not so much for Abdul. Considering the negative historical context of being part of an occupied country, one is left wondering how he could see beyond this and still admire the queen so much. (His fellow Indian who joined him on the initial journey is very clear in his contempt for the situation.) If more time was given to Abdul for his story and background, this might have been more understood. Similarly, both main characters put themselves at great risk in their connection. Though early scenes adequately show the beginning of the kinship, there is too little to follow this to give the viewer an understanding of why they became so close.It's impossible to avoid comparing ""Victoria and Abdul"" to the very similar ""Mrs. Brown"" released twenty years ago. Both films had Dench portraying Queen Victoria developing a strong platonic friendship with a manservant during her widowhood. ""Mrs. Brown"" is the stronger film for various reasons including a lack of anachronisms of which there were many in the current film.But to its credit, ""Victoria and Abdul"" has a very enjoyable comical beginning as it exposes a ridiculously busy daily schedule for an aging monarch as well as her boredom and contempt for the grovelers that surround her. Might this be the attitude of the current monarch?",Victoria & Abdul

Of course, today, this would be just as unlikely as it was then, but it is a true wonder that this story was ever told at all. Does not paint a good picture of Queen Victoria's children who mistreated the aging queen with such disrespect and Abdul with such racist disdain. The true story of what Victoria's children did, expunge any trace of the friendship Victoria had with Abdul, is a cautionary tale of how adult children should not treat their aging parents. It's called parental abuse. Today such a friendship would be fodder for the tabloids, but at least it would have been told. Well done and worth seeing.",Victoria & Abdul
43,cultfilmfan,Victoria and Abdul,7,21 October 2017,"Momentarily after the new film, Victoria and Abdul starts, there is a title card that humorously tells us that the story we are about to see is inspired by true events, at least mostly as the playful title word play suggests. As you will later discover having watched the film, this statement not only about the film, but what takes place and what did apparently happen in reality may in some ways be found to be humorous, as there is a lot of comedy and things to find amusing within this account, but at the same time there is also tragedy that is all the more disturbing because it is not caused by unforeseen circumstances, or events, but instead at the hands of your fellow human beings, who still after all these years have racist and xenophobic tendencies that as much as we may progress as a human race in some ways, these are things that are unfortunately still alive and well as much as we wish they weren't. The film which is as we later learn based on journals and writings of one of our main characters, chronicles the friendship between then Queen Victoria of England and a man named Abdul, who is living over in India, which is then under British rule because of colonialism and she is considered to be Queen not only of England, but also as an Empress of India as well. How a very humble and in many ways, simple person such as Abdul should come not only to meet, but also befriend Queen Victoria, when in actuality they are literally world's apart, I will leave to your viewing pleasure to see the story unfold before you. This is a friendship much to the exasperation of not only Queen Victoria's staff, children and fellow ruling members of the British aristocracy, but even to Abdul, who comes from an entirely different background, culture and world than what he is introduced to when he comes to England in the presence of Queen Victoria. Instead of being pompous, or even hateful because of the British rule in his homeland of India, Abdul willingly serves and also befriends Victoria, and the two of them really bring out the best of themselves and also each other. We see how Victoria, is getting in many ways feeble and frail because of her old age and in a lot of ways she has little to nothing in common with her own family, or the people who work beside, or under her. She is respected by them, but as the film moves along these other counterparts who are meant to be loyal, really just seem to be in it for themselves, and their own best interests are at the heart of everything they do. Abdul, as I mentioned is extremely humble and unlike the fellow ruling class at that time, he is a man that seems not only full of life, but also of joy. Often when we see him, he has a gigantic smile on his face that is almost infectious and he has an optimistic attitude at most if not any time and situation. Victoria is often tired, bored and grows weary of everything that sits in front of her and yet Abdul breathes life and energy into her and makes her not only love the life that she has, but to treasure the things in her life and also what makes this world so very precious indeed. They write together, he teaches her and they just generally have a wonderful connection and bond to one another that I can safely say that she had with no one else within her quarters. For the sake of the monarchy and power that was in her grasp, her fellow servants, family and monarchy all try to stop Abdul, and get him as far away from her as possible, but even when he is threatened he remains both loyal and the best friend that Victoria could possibly have. This is a story of a friendship which knew no boundaries and a love that may have tried to have been suppressed, but instead grew all the more because of it. And instead of hating, or ridiculing each other because of culture, or other background issues, they instead embrace what each other and their culture and world views have to offer. There is a lot of beauty and hope to be found in this film by witnessing this relationship and in a lot of ways there is a gentle and kind quality to this film. We also do witness as I stated earlier the evil side of mankind which is just as prevalent today as it was back then. The film falls a little bit victim of melodrama and some clichéd if not familiar territory in the second half, but it still holds up well as a film as a whole and is a beautiful story that needs to be told and also a lesson in acceptance and tolerance that everyone should see. The performances are all spot on and this is a film not only to inspire, but also as a valuable life lesson of acceptance and even love which I think will win over even the most hardened of hearts.",Victoria & Abdul
44,dave-mcclain,"interesting, entertaining and very well acted, if a bit uneven",6,9 October 2017,"""Based on a true story mostly."" These opening words appear on the screen to set the tone for the historical drama ""Victoria & Abdul"" (PG-13, 1:52). The title characters are the U.K.'s Queen Victoria (who lived from 1819 to 1901, reigning from the age of 18 until she died at the age of 81) and her Muslim Indian servant, Abdul Karim (who lived from 1863 to 1909 and served the queen for the last 14 years of her life). Although Abdul is mentioned frequently in the queen's journal and correspondence, scholars only began seriously examining his life and his relationship with the queen over a decade after the 1951 publication of the memoirs of her head of the royal household, Frederick Ponsonby. Additional interest in Victoria and Abdul's relationship grew from Karim's diary which his family finally made public in 2010. Indian author Shrabani Basu wrote the 2010 historical novel on which the movie is based, but screenwriter Lee Hall (""Billy Elliot"") and director Stephen Frears (""The Queen"") definitely took some liberties with history. They made a film which condenses the story (as most biopics do) and makes it somewhat light-hearted. They use the basic outline of the historical friendship between the title characters, add a few documented incidents from that relationship and fictionalize the rest of the story. They also choose to overplay certain personal characteristics of the people involved while downplaying others. For example, the real Abdul was more arrogant than the film shows and the queen's son wasn't quite as vindictive as portrayed, but every story needs conflict and having clearly defined heroes and villains helps. Regardless, the spirit of the relationship between Queen Victoria and Abdul Karim is depicted accurately and enjoyably. The two of them formed a close friendship and a very strong bond which occupied the queen for years – and defined Abdul's life, giving him a unique place in history. It's 1887 and the U.K. is celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria (Oscar winner Dame Judi Dench). She's been Queen of the British Empire for 50 years, but officially been Empress of India for just over a decade. She knows little of the Indian subcontinent, but she is curious about it. When two native Indians, Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) and his friend Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar), are brought to London for the festivities and present a ceremonial coin to the queen, she takes a keen interest in them, especially Abdul. Mohammed hates the British because of their rule over his homeland, while Abdul takes a more positive approach, appreciating the honor of meeting the queen. She is bored with life as (eventually) the longest reigning monarch in British history – and is desperately lonely since the death of her husband years earlier. The friendship between Victoria and Abdul scratches itches for both of them.When the queen expresses interest in Abdul and Mohammad, they are prevented from going back to India and become her servants for the duration of the jubilee, leading to many more interactions between Victoria and Abdul. His and Mohammad's extended stay gets extended further when the queen gives Abdul the title of Munshi (a type of teacher). At her request, Abdul instructs the queen in the Indian language of Urdu and in the Muslim faith. As the two grow closer, the members of the royal household increasingly object to the presence and rising position of this ""common"" Indian. Particularly strong objections come from her son, Bertie (Eddie Izzard), the queen's heir apparent. Bertie and other members of the court work to drive a wedge between Victoria and Abdul, but Abdul makes the queen happy and she does her best to stand up for him, even as he remains her devoted servant and friend.""Victoria & Abdul"" is an entertaining look at ""history's most unlikely friendship"". Hall's script weaves an intriguing tale, even if it does take liberties with the actual histories of the characters and oversimplifies the issues involved in their relationship. The comedic elements sometimes make the movie more enjoyable, but other times feel like silly and unnecessary distractions from what is inherently an interesting story. Although he has done better work helming 2016's ""Florence Foster Jenkins"", 2013's ""Philomena"", 1998's ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and directing Dame Helen Mirren to Oscar glory in 2006's ""The Queen"", Frears has given us another quality film. Still, its main strength is its acting. Fazal delivers a charming and sympathetic performance, while Dench again shows how well she knows her way around a cinematic throne, after winning an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth I in 1998's ""Shakespeare in Love"" – and playing a younger Queen Victoria in 1997's ""Mrs. Brown"". It's a pleasure to watch the two stars interact, while the supporting cast does their share to make this occasionally uneven film well worth a look. ""B""",Victoria & Abdul
45,jrarichards,"Not entirely without redeeming features, but often looking like a mean and ludicrous farce",6,28 September 2017,"This is a biopic about the great great grandmother of our present Queen (""The Queen"" as far as Stephen Frears's earlier film starring Helen Mirren is concerned). It also features her great grandfather Edward VII, another real and in many ways important historical figure shown in such a non-positive light that it must be seen as a profoundly wrong and impertinent portrayal (unless what is shown here is really true, which seems far from plausible to the casual viewer).In fact, this film begins by declaring it is ""mostly"" telling a true story - in the context of a kind of jokey presentation style that scarcely inspires confidence. Indeed, at no time does this BBC offering directed by Frears really seek to inspire said confidence. Rather, it is cynically happy to spend half its time one step away from farce (albeit pointed and cruel farce), while parasitising on the well-known capacity of Dame Judi Dench to add gravitas and class to any role she takes on. This is indeed the case as Dench takes the heroine of our story through to her very deathbed of 1901, and to that epoch-making moment in the constant company of her real-life steadfast companion and Munshi (teacher) from Agra, Abdul Karim.Now this is clearly an amazing story, and - to be fair - Frears at no time strays from the remarkable truth that Victoria was truly a non-racist in an era of unthinking racism. Dench's portrayal of Her Majesty makes her a sympathetic and wise figure, even if she does get to utter a number of implausible-looking lines about how fed up of being Queen she really is, how lonely, how disappointed in her family, and indeed how self-loathing. Ali Fazal is the Moslem Karim, who comes to the rescue of his Empress, endlessly loyal, though also it seems plagued mercilessly by a sexually-transmitted disease! Does Her Majesty fancy him anyway, or is she just touched by his devotion and capacity to cut through the protocol to show real feeling? No stone is left unturned in this area, but it all remains pretty decorous and at times touching.In contrast, Frears has little mercy for the royal households at Windsor and the gorgeous Osborne House (Isle of Wight), or indeed for the aforementioned ""Bertie"" (the future Edward VII). The latter is portrayed very convincingly by Eddie Izzard in terms of looks, but far-from-plausibly in what the character says and does. When he meets Karim's fellow Indian servant, who has failed to make the same meteoric rise his colleague has managed and is now near death due to TB, he gets to hear an embittered and angry diatribe against the British Empire (you can just feel how much Frears loves every minute of that), before promising the would-be rebel that he is not going to make it out of the place alive! Did the future King really investigate such matters himself? Might he really be so angry and merciless and devious?Background reading makes it clear that a (surprisingly) great deal of what is shown in the film DID INDEED actually happen, or at least is very much in the spirit of what happened, so YET AGAIN we are left with a biopic showing real people doing (some) real things that very often fails to convince. And in this case quite a lot of the blame must be laid with Director Frears. Just for starters, he should follow the basic rule that - if one really insists on simplifying centuries of Empire involving countless millions of people down to a single cliché word or concept - it is necessary to choose between ""evil"" and ""ridiculous"" and not try hopelessly to suggest both at the same time! Likewise, comedy is comedy, farce is farce and a historical film is a historical film. Films do in fact have genres for a reason.As usual, a piece of this kind inspires a huge desire to read up further on its subject matter - which can only be a good thing. But it is also absurd in many ways that more pleasure and insight is gained from the reading than from the film inspiring that response in the first place! That said, Dame Judi really can do no wrong to my mind, and she does indeed achieve a pretty compelling portrayal of a monarch only now being revealed, not as a one-dimensional figure, but as someone who can be a genuine source of wonder in all her multi-stranded diversity. Perhaps that is reason enough to give ""Victoria and Abdul"" a watch, for all its imperfections?",Victoria & Abdul
46,bob-the-movie-man,"""And the Oscar goes to... Dame Judi Dench""",10,17 September 2017,"As we crawl out of the (largely disappointing) summer movie season, the first of the serious award-contenders hoves into view. Victoria and Abdul tells the untold story of a hushed-up relationship between an aged Queen Victoria (Judi Dench, ""Philomina"", ""Spectre"") and her Indian servant, Abdul Kareem (Ali Fazal). Kareem is shipped to England from Agra to deliver a ceremonial coin to the Queen on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee, together with a grumbling 'stand-in tall guy' Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar, ""The Big Sick"", ""Four Lions""). Kareem finds the Queen as sour, depressed and acidic as her post-Albert reputation would have you imagine. But something clicks between the two, and pretty soon the perked-up queen is learning Urdu and all about the Koran, much to the horror of her successor Teddy, the Prince of Wales (a splendid Eddie Izzard, ""Oceans 13"") and the rest of the royal household, who try desperate measures to derail the relationship. This film is a complete delight. I went along without great expectations.... a worthy film I thought I should go and see to write a worthy review about. But I was entranced from beginning to end. It's probably best described as a comedy drama... always a difficult trick for a movie-maker to pull off. But here in the competent hands of director Stephen Frears (""Florence Foster Jenkins"") the comedy is both very, VERY funny, with the drama also being extremely moving. And crucially the transition between the two never feels forced. I've seen a few critical comments that the film's underlying topic - the subjugation of the Indian state and the queen's role in that, is a ""serious topic"" and not a suitable subject for a comedy like this. And of course, ""the Empire"" is a terrible legacy that the British people have around their necks in the same manner as Germans have their Nazi past and the American South have their history of slavery. But the film never really gets into these issues in any depth: Abdul's background, whilst sketchily drawn and feeling rather sanitised for the late 1800's, is one of a middle-class Indian with a decent colonial job: someone shown respect by his British managers. While the ""uprising"" of Muslims is mentioned - indeed it's a key part of the story - Victoria's lack of knowledge of such things, or indeed of all things to do with the country she is 'Empress' of, is made clear. The focus of the film is quite rightly on the understandable scandal (for the day) of the queen of England (and hence head of the Church of England) having a spiritual teacher (or ""Munshi"") who is neither white nor Christian. If there is a criticism to be made of the splendid script by Lee Hall (""War Horse"") it is that the racial references - and there are a few - feel rather over-sanitised given the tensions that erupt as the story unfolds. Above all, this is an acting tour de force for Dame Judi, reprising her role as the elderly queen from ""Mrs Brown"" which (shockingly!) is now 20 years old. I know its early in the season to be placing bets, before having seen any of the other major contenders, but Dench's ""insanity"" speech screams ""Oscar reel"" to me. Her performance is masterly from beginning to end. Rather overshadowed by Dench is the relative newcomer to western cinema Ali Fazal (he had a role in the ""Furious 7"" film). But his performance is almost as impressive, bringing the warmth and compassion to the supporting role that is so sorely needed if the overall balance of the film is to be maintained. The supporting cast is equally stellar with Olivia Williams (""An Education"", ""The Sixth Sense"") acidic as Baroness Churchill; Simon Callow (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") as Puccini; Michael Gambon (""Harry Potter"") as Lord Salisbury and Tim Pigott-Smith as Henry Ponsonby, head of the royal household. This was Pigott-Smith's final live-action performance before his untimely death at the age of only 70 in April of this year: and it's sad to say that he really doesn't look well in this film. Also of note is Fenella Woolgar as lady's maid Miss Phipps, comical as a the quivering wreck holding the shortest straw in having to face up to her ferocious mistress.Another star of the show is the Scottish countryside, ravishingly photographed by Danny Cohen (""Florence Foster Jenkins"", ""Room"") with this film probably doing more for the Scottish Tourist Board than any paid for advertising could ever do!As the film comments it's ""Based on a True Story... Mostly"", and this tease of a caption both infuriates and intrigues in equal measure.  I may feel obliged to delve into the original source material by Shrabani Basu to learn more.  Overall this is a true delight of a film, perfectly balanced, brilliantly acted: I would say this is a ""must see"" for any older viewers over the age of 50 in need of a cinema outing that doesn't disappoint. This is everything that (for me) ""Viceroy's House"" should have been but wasn't. Highly recommended. (For the graphical version of this review, please visit www.bob-the- movie-man.com.

The film began to take itself a bit too seriously and any fun or enjoyment was lost. It all ended up a little bit depressing. Such is life sometimes, I guess.Would still recommend to Judi Dench fans and anyone that receives a age pension.",Victoria & Abdul
51,meydiana-65242,Such a beautiful movie.,10,3 November 2020,"The first thing anyone will say after watching this movie is how utterly amazing Judi Dench is, and rightly so, she ones again dons the robes of Queen Victoria and gives a commanding performance as one of the most famous monarchs. A performance worthy of an Oscar, she is an actress with unrivalled talent. This film is so much more then Dench's performance, spellbinding though it was.Ali Fazal, also worthy of accolades and awards, for his superb performance as Indian servant Abdul Karim. His performance is actually rather captivating, The Queen was taken under his spell and as a viewer so was I. Such an intriguing, fascinating character, probably unlike any other man she'd ever encountered.Superb production values throughout, the film was visually dazzling, sumptuous settings, jaw dropping costumes, this was a treat for the senses.A film is meant to move, and allow for escapism, when it can educate as well, it's worth of the elevated sore of 10/10.Absolutely loved it.",Victoria & Abdul
52,Alexander_Blanchett,Judi Dench's return to old glory,8,4 October 2017,"Judi Dench returns to one of her most famous roles. And once again gives an undeniable great performance that is another notable entry on her great filmography. The film itself is not flawless but it is effective in what it tries to achieve. Director Stephen Frears wonderfully mixes drama with comedy and works with very up to date topics. In a way you could see the film as politically relevant for these days. The heart and soul of the film is of course Dench. She really has many memorable turns and really is the perfect choice to play this role. I don't think it will be enough for an Oscar nom, mostly because of the movie around her is ""only"" good but she should be a shoe in for a Golden Globe nomination. The problem with the film is that the core story is not that exciting and actually quite similar to the former Queen Victoria biopic ""Mrs. Brown"". However it is nicely photographed and has a fantastic score by Thomas Newman. Also the performance of Ali Fazal is quite decent, especially at the end. I like Michael Gambon's turn and Olivia Williams is memorable. The best performance besides Dench comes from Eddie Izzard tho who works his quite lone dimensional character quite well. Adeel Akhtar is a great comedic sidekick. Stephen Frears has done better biopics but also much worse. Its a very charming film. Touching, funny and thought provoking. Very cute in a way. Historically accurate? Well for some parts for sure but clearly not for all.",Victoria & Abdul
53,Jithindurden,A Pleasant little film,6,6 February 2018,"This feels more like a fairy tale dream of an Indian guy who starts dreaming at the beginning of the film and wakes up towards the end rather than based on actual events which is almost confirmed by the ""mostly"" written along with based on real events caption at the beginning. Even though predictable the film manages to keep you entertained and is quite funny for the most part. Even though the plot or characters are not very interesting the situations are created in between which are quite funny and keeps a pleasant mood throughout.

55,davidgee,Royal carry-on,8,5 October 2017,"Very much a 'companion piece' to MRS BROWN (1997), this cosy piece of royal hagiography finds the Old Girl nearing the end of her reign, her health and her hearing in decline, curmudgeonly and sorry for herself. The arrival of a humble but handsome Indian clerk at Bucking-ham Palace brings a sparkle to her fading eyes. The rest of the court are aghast as Abdul slips swiftly into the role of latest (and last) Best Friend, the role previously – and a lot more cavalierly - occupied by John Brown.Re-casting Judi Dench as Her Majesty gives the story continuity as well as a degree of credibility, though this is rather obviously a small moment of monarchy stretched into a full-length comedy-drama. Even playing a frail old biddy, Dame Judi is at full throttle, calling to mind Edith Evans's unforgettable Lady Bracknell and Bette Davis's Elizabeth the First as much as other portrayals of Queen Victoria. Ali Fazal is as beguiling as he needs to be, although his grumpy companion Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar) steals many of their scenes, playing Sancho Panza to Abdul's Quixote. Tim Pigott-Smith's swansong as the head of the royal household has a pantomime grandeur to it; and Michael Gambon's Lord Salisbury and Eddie Izzard's Prince of Wales bring gloriously camp echoes of the Carry-On franchise, as - especially - do Olivia Williams's Lady Churchill and Simon Callow's cameo as Puccini.Directed with great verve, wittily scripted and sumptuously produced, this is a charming - and touching - slice of ho-hum history.",Victoria & Abdul
56,CineMuseFilms,Another impeccable British historical drama with another venerable icon of British cinema.,8,20 September 2017,"Another impeccable British historical drama with another venerable icon of British cinema. What more can be said? Lots, actually. While Victoria and Abdul (2017) looks like more nostalgic self- indulgence wrapped in sumptuous period settings, it is also a cutting critique of British colonialism, a satire on aristocratic pomposity, but most of all, a bitter-sweet comedic story about the loneliness of being a Queen.Her Majesty Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) has been monarch for 50 years and her boredom with royal occasions is palpable. Coincidence and luck leads to a lowly clerk Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) travelling from India to present her with a medal in grateful recognition of British colonial rule. Court etiquette requires that one must never look at the Queen and to retreat backwards after addressing Her Majesty. When presenting the medal, the curious Abdul cannot resist a peep; their eyes meet, and Victoria is instantly charmed by the tall, good-looking Indian who appears so human in contrast to court toadies. She summons Abdul and soon he is her constant companion and mentor, much to the disgust of the racist lackeys who fawn for her favour. The relationship would last 15 years, during which time Victoria learnt about Indian language and customs. She developed a genuine sympathy for the nation over which she ruled as Empress of India.While labelled a drama, the treatment is distinctly comedic. Court manners and customs are low- hanging fruit for mockery, and caricatures of court sycophants are all too easy to construct. But the humour masks the deeper layers of the story. Until she met Abdul, Victoria knew nothing of India and shared Britain's official contempt for this unruly land and its ignorant masses. Imperialism carried a divine right to rule over lesser humans and it was only through Abdul's influence that Victoria developed sympathy for the nation and its problems. The relationship with Abdul is also one of the most liberating experiences of Victoria's long reign and helped overcome the loneliness of royal isolation in her senior years. Judi Dench portrays this emotional transformation with extraordinary power: no living actress can match her imperious gaze. Her face has become more transparently expressive over her long career and even a miniscule raising of an eyebrow can speak volumes. The new spring in an old lady's step, the twinkle in her eyes, the firming of her voice, all tell of the universal pleasures of connecting with another human, irrespective of any age divide. While Ali Fazal shares star billing, his aura is inevitably overshadowed by Dench. His greatest contribution to the film is being able to portray ambivalence between being just another sycophant or an innocent with genuine fondness for the Queen.Historians will no doubt finds things to dispute and that is their job. As cinema, however, this is as good as historical dramas get. The script has a contemporary feel that makes the dialogue relevant to many of the racial issues we face today. The filming alone makes the movie worth seeing, offering a delightful tour of grand palaces and glimpses of courtly life in 19th Century England. While the British have made many such films, it's hard not to enjoy Victoria and Abdul.",Victoria & Abdul
57,borgolarici,So corny,5,8 July 2019,"Visually impressive but corny rendition of real events.The fictional Munshi isn't really interesting as a person, looks aside, and it's not clear what made the Queen fall so deeply for him.

60,kaptenvideo-89875,Deeper than your regular oldies but goldies story,8,6 October 2017,"Before seeing Victoria and Abdul"", I was secretly hoping the movie would be about Noisy Nation's lead singer Artur Abdul's triumphant return to stardom, including marrying the newest Mrs Estonia (whose name is Viktoria by the way). Actually, it's a 120 years old true story, about aging Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) withering away on the throne of the British empire, basically just waiting for death. Then she strikes up an unlikely friendship with a young Indian clerk named Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) whose good spiritual influence helps her to find her way again. Also appearing: Adeel Akhtar, Eddie Izzard, Fenella Woolgar, Julian Wadham, Michael Gambon, Olivia Williams, Paul Higgins, Simon Callow, Tim Pigott-Smith. I started the review with a joke that has only a tiny probability to be understood, even if I explained it to you. Had two reasons for this: I find it quite amusing myself (I am my most important audience and critic anyway), and this kind of conceptual joke working on different levels seemed oddly appropriate considering what this movie is really about. By the latter I mean that Victoria and Abdul"" is the easiest type of movie to be overlooked, so one does not get"" it. Look at any promotional material and what do you see? Judi Dench is playing a cranky old queen striking a friendship with lower class citizen (very bad thing at her time) and finding happiness again, right? It's really easy to see only the crowd-pleasing feel- good aspect of the story which screams royalties they are just people too"". After all, a remarkable number of such-themed movies or series has been released in the last 10-15 years alone. Not to mention ""old actors playing old people"" movies which is a popular ""genre"" too. It's also easy to be entertained or bored only by the most straightforward, crowd-pleasing part of the movie, because it works really well too. I watched it in cinema, and other people were often laughing, or wiping tears during the sadder parts. But the story is actually deeper and more varied than that, which was a pleasant surprise considering I didn't even plan to watch V&A"" in the first place, having very little interest in the private lives of British royal family and all. The more hidden part – well, maybe not hidden, but more easily overlooked part – ponders about the main existential themes in the human life. In context of the particular story I'd summarize it as follows: they study what keeps us going in life, and what keeps us going when one has achieved everything one can come up with rationally. It is interesting to see the shadow side of the power – on one hand, it gives you much more personal freedom. On the other hand, however, it creates one new forms of prison, separating from the others and making one addicted to it. It gets increasingly difficult to let go of it even if one doesn't enjoy it any more. It may be lonely up there"" alone but at the same time it frightens to break down the self-built walled garden because you don't see any alternatives either. Come to think of it, it's true about life in general too, not only having power over people. The performances are wonderful. The cast have the skills and a keen eye to play all the above-mentioned themes out in detail, whether just for laughs or philosophical digesting, depending on the viewer. The main attention is, of course, on Judi Dench essentially reprising the role from 20 years earlier (Mrs. Brown"") which brought her the very first Oscar nom she had. She never tries to dominate the screen but her great natural and magnetic screen presence can't be denied, of course. Also, there's a fearless dedication to showing all the getting old thing in gory"" details, with flagging skin, curdled mimics, draggy movements and all. I don't know how much of it was just acting, but she really is pretty old, turning 83 in December. It's probably not easy to face your own mortality while acting it out on screen, in any case. Great performance overall, and awards shouldn't be out of question. It is kind of silly, after all, that thespian this legendary has gotten her only Academy Award for trivial role as Queen Elizabeth in Shakespare in Love"", where she has eight minutes of screen time. There's maybe not much mainstream attention left for Ali Fazal as the other lead, but he's actually very good too. The young Indian actor hasn't done many movies yet but he's superbly enjoyable in a role which requires a certain amount of simple mainstream ethnical humor but also sincerity, lightness and soulfulness that you couldn't probably just act without not finding in yourself first. If I can name anything wrong with Victoria and Abdul"", I would probably tone it down a little while showing the reactions of enraged royal family and court members who just can't take seeing lower-class person having so much influence over the the person with the ultimate power. There's enough visual details such as angry faces to make their feelings clear enough – they don't really have to say things like what the hell is going on here?"" all the time. In this aspect the movie can feel a little overcooked"" at times, but luckily it didn't ruin the experience for me. V&A"" is pretty great watch, both as simple entertainment and a little deeper examination of what makes us value life in general. Director Stephen Frears has given us a fair share of noteworthy movies over the 50 years he's been releasing them, including Dangerous Liaisons"", High Fidelity"", The Queen"", and Philomena"" (one of my favorite movies released in 2013, also starring Judi Dench). I say Victoria and Abdul"" is a worthy addition to his legacy.",Victoria & Abdul
61,ritera1,"Very good acting, little else.",4,8 October 2017,"A bit lost on why Dench did this film. It certainly was a wealth to work with in context of the character.But the script was very much historically inaccurate. The direction was poor and the editing choppy.Billed as the relationship between the Queen and Abdul, it actually asked you to take their word for it and then focused on the redundant conflict between their relationship and the rest of the household. Only a few cursory scenes between the two and their interactions that felt laborious with no chemistry. If they supposedly had such absorbing conversations, you never saw them.What little I subsequently read, it was very clear that extensive historical inaccuracies were boiled down to an essentially fictional account compressed into a relatively short span vs. the long period that it did take place. Abdul, as depicted, was supposedly selfless and devoted. History actually said he was very selfish and opportunistic, which would be line with reality being that the British Empire was no friend of the Indian people. Thus, a selfless Indian devotee of the Queen would be bizarre.One oddity that stood out to me was Mohammid's death. In the film, Mohammid wanted to go back to India but ended up in England 'til his death due to the weather. No explanation why he would not have been permitted to return and why Abdul would not have facilitated that. Didn't happen like that in real life, though.The direction was poor as there was no ebb and flow to the dialogue and interchanges. Most parties were speaking with the same rushed rhythm and tone. Had the feeling that the production was very much rushed and these good actors could only do the best they could. Don't want to detail such, but the editing was choppy at best.One of the warning flags was early on when they teased showing the Queen's face, over and over. Then when they did it farted out as it was at a distance and hard to see her face. I expected some sort of distinct appearance and a look of dejection from Dench.Miss it. Not worth it.

66,GypsiB,"Fun, But Lacks Depth",6,13 October 2017,"Victoria and Abdul is the ""'mostly"" true story of the unlikely friendship between Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) and a Muslim Indian, Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal). Karim is sent from India as an emissary, and the Queen is taken with him and his easy personality, treats him with favor, and bestows honors on him. Her family and attendants, especially her son Bertie (later to be Edward VII, played by Eddie Izzard), dislike him and his influence and try to discredit him with the Queen.Dame Judi is fantastic in this role. She plays ailing, grouchy, and old to perfection, then lights up the screen with grace, majesty and strength. It would not surprise me to see her win awards for this performance.Fazal was also wonderful in his role as sweet, endearing, devoted to the Queen. However, his part was not three-dimensional--he was too perfect, too servile. The viewer was left wondering what made Abdul tick, and what his motives were.In addition, the story (which covered the 15 years of Karim's service to the Queen) was short on plot. It was, instead, a string of tableaux in which both featured, but without their relationship developing or maturing. Furthermore, the portrayal of Queen Victoria as a liberal-thinking woman was, I think, colored more by wishful thinking than historical accuracy.I did like the film, though. It is cute, sweet, and at times, funny, with a positive message of tolerance and equality. It was enjoyable to watch, but the lack of depth to the plot kept it from being fully immersive.

For the hour that I saw, it plays out exactly as you would expect it to. The British are terrible, intolerant, stuffy and arrogant. Our culture and heritage and traditions are there to be mocked and laughed at whilst all other cultures are pure and virtuous and perfect with all of their regressive idiosyncrasies conveniently overlooked.Never mind that the world was different back then. Never mind that the Empire did many good and positive things to shape the world into what it is today. Never mind that it was a woman who held such a high position in what is portrayed as such a disgusting patriarchal society. Never mind that no other empire still maintains such good relations with its former colonies.No, no, let's sweep all that away and ensure that the studio's Diversity & Inclusion officer has gone through the script with a marker pen to ensure that at every opportunity Britain, sorry England, is ridiculed, denigrated and besmirched with a heavy coating of bigotry, nastiness and intolerance.I wonder if Bollywood produces film that are so ready to, at best poke fun and at worst, pour acidic scorn on the very culture that made it.

78,VikiLauda,Not quite...Victoria!,5,27 February 2019,"First off I am absolutely addicted to Royal history, who has read a heap of biographies on Queen Victoria as she was such a fascinating person to study. Queen Victoria was a PASSIONATE lady & was nothing like the common assumption of the ""we are not amused"" persona.
Ok now onto the film.
Once again Judi Dench does an amazing job, again of playing QV, & the rest of the cast delivered. Ali Fazal was excellent, although perhaps too handsome to play Karim who was actually overweight & not very good looking! & I am certainly not a fan of Eddie Izzard but as Bertie he delighted. The make up & costume were all top notch, as was the screenplay, the pacing & the cinematography which was beautifully done. However, a lot of this film is historically inaccurate.
Abdul Karim as mentioned above was not drop dead gorgeous like Ali Fazal (be still my beating heart!) & ruthlessly used his position with the Queen for his own gain & position in society, QV however was absolutely besotted with him so he could get away with anything. The script simply does not work in places, as QV was very India savvy for her time. QV was historically a liberal & as Empress of India she was well aware of Indian culture & history. This film paints her as ""slightly dim"" to anything Indian, which is simply false!
The editing was turbulent in places & the direction was nothing to shout about, however it was easy to watch & I quite enjoyed it (if I could forget the historical inaccuracies)
One part that baffled me was Mrs Karims clothes. Back in the late 19th century in India, Muslim ladies would not have worn the full burka as it is not traditional dress. So when Mrs Karim unveils for the Queen she is wearing beautiful full Rajastan costume, which WOULD have greatly impressed the Queen. QV would have actually been horrified to have seen a woman in a burka because as a liberal she would have seen the garment as oppressive. She certainly would not have said ""She looks splendid & dignified"" so I feel the writers were taking some liberties with Vicotria's character to push their own political agenda. Queen Victoria was very feminist in real life.
Anyway, don't get me wrong, this was a nice attempt at telling the utterly fascinating story of the real, genuine relationship Victoria had with Abdul, & the rife it caused in the Royal Household, but it could have been better if the writers had represented Abdul as being QV's only ""felt"" connection with India, & Abdul's own very real manipulation of the Queen for his own gain, which made him a very rich man.
If like me you adore Royal history, you might want to give this a try.

79,princessstrickland21,Wonderful just wonderful,7,15 August 2018,Dame Judy Dench does a marvelous job as Queen. This movie is based on truth. The story is about Queen Victoria making a friendship with her servant from India. I find it one of the best. Great acting as well as the story. Makes the story come to life of the queen.,Victoria & Abdul
80,Jackblyth8,Judi Dench is Royalty,8,28 January 2021,"'Vitoria and Abdul' is a heart-felt, moving drama with a pinch of humour. The story mentions in its opening scenes that Britain had formally ruled India for 29 years, before showing life in the crowded Indian streets. Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria who is portrayed as a miserable figure, but, when an Indian servant comes to visit, her attitude changes drastically. The year is 1887 and in British India, Abdul Karim, a prison clerk, is told that he will present the famous mohur to The Queen at her jubilee. Abdul travels with his partner Mohammed and arrive at Windsor Castle, where the pair are instructed of their duties. In a feature at the large dining table, Judi Dench appears fatigued and bored whilst in the company of many formal guests. As Abdul confronted her majesty with the gold coin, he disobeyed strict instructions to not make eye contact with her, as he did, she engaged in an intense stare, where her mood seemed to change. She reported back to the people of the castle that she wanted Abdul to stay, finding him incredibly good looking, and keeps him by her side as a servant. The two create a very strong relationship and Queen Victoria is determined to learn Hindi. She takes Abdul everywhere she goes and Mohammed is still situated in a room in the castle, desperate to return to his home country - becoming very badly ill caused by the English weather. In Florence, the enthusiastic Abdul tells The Queen that he has a wife, surprised, Dench's character questions why Abdul didn't mention before and orders him to have her at the castle. Much to their disagreement, the folks of the castle, led by Victoria's son Bertie, aim to dig in on Abdul and have him banned from the premises, envious of the attention he receives. The Queen's doctor is made to assess Abdul's wife's fertility and concludes that Abdul has gonorrhoea and present The Queen with past incidents involving Abdul, following in-depth searching from Bertie. Queen Victoria - furious with the actions of her folk - purposely spends more time with the Indian servant, he teaches her about the Indian mutiny and how his father played a big role in the teaching. Promoted as her Munshi, he explains the great success within the mutiny, something that the Empress of India was impressed about. During a meeting involving the people of the house, Queen Victoria humiliates herself in speaking with pride about the mutiny, unaware that it is the Indian Rebellion's battle against innocent British soldiers. Embarrassed, The Queen orders Abdul to leave with his family and Mohammed, but after some time, she appears to miss her Munshi, the man who helped, supported and educated her, commanding to have him returned. In a bid once again to dismiss Abdul, Bertie questions Mohammed, who is extremely sick and alone in his small room. The second servant ridicules Bertie and refuses to talk badly about Abdul. Significantly, Mohammed's words supporting and protecting Abdul were his last, his funeral taking place by the castle, attended by an emotional Abdul and The Queen. Victoria in an act of gratitude, intends on giving Abdul a knighthood for his service, which causes the household to revolt. In confronting The Queen they threaten to resign if the knighthood takes place; Queen Victoria chooses not to Knight Abdul, but keeps him as her Munshi. Bertie's patience suggests he is waiting for his mother to die, knowing that Abdul wouldn't last long following the death. As Judi Dench's character becomes weaker, she dies in her bed after asking Abdul to accompany her. Bertie sees the consolation in his mother's passing as convenient, making him the new King of England. His first order sees him raid the home of Abdul's family, forcing them to leave the country and never come back, along with burning any possessions created by her majesty and Abdul. This left Abdul distraught, and showed the Indian servant return with his family to Agra. The ending scene sees Abdul kiss the feet of Queen Victoria's statue near the Taj Mahal, emulating one of the first interactions with the Queen. An epic tale taken from true events provides, in detail, a heart-warming story showing how life for a working class prison clerk, can subvert into the Queen of England's and the Empress of India's servant. An innocent, caring man admired by Queen Victoria, causing outrage in the castle. A rather rebellious Judi Dench encapsulates the gritty performance required to mirror the emotional rollercoaster involving the Indian and The Queen. Her melancholic daily routines became tiring and her misery was caused by her ultimate boredom. The introduction of her soon to be named Munshi allowed her to try something new, and alter her usual lifestyle - avoiding tedium and becoming more adventurous. Her hope in life was completely centred around her relationship with Abdul. The at times difficult watch expresses the developing relationship that because of her status, shouldn't happen, but it did. Incredibly it did.",Victoria & Abdul

A loser sees an opportunity to seduce platonically an older female monarch, and becomes a charlatan and uses his influence to corrupt the Queen.

82,GoUSN,A marvelous film in every regard,9,23 September 2017,"I should have expected that in these divisive days mainstream press reviewers would all pan this film because it amounts to a favorable depiction of British colonial policy in India and elsewhere. One reviewer referred to the British imperial era as ""occupations"" of the colonies, deliberately using a word that this same element would never use in, say, describing post-WWII Soviet ""occupations"" of Eastern Europe.The film is a personal study. It depicts Abdul as an aspiring man, who appreciates and admires Britain. He was not servile, because anyone - of any color - in that era would have been required to be similarly ""servile"" to the Queen of England. It depicts Victoria as the complicated woman we know her to be - she was in this sense the last of the old monarchs and the first of the new. Her reign began just 18 years after that of George III (the ""American Revolution"" George III), and ruled long enough to last into the lives of people like my own great-grandmother. The world changed significantly in that 64-year span of time, and the era could only have produced a monarch as fascinating and complex as Victoria.Here too is the first multi-cultural friendship to take the world stage. Lost on the reviewers. Here is an ascendant Indian, well-educated precisely because of the British. Lost on the reviewers. Here is a Queen interacting deeply with the Indian, an actually ""diverse"" friendship. Lost on the reviewers.This is, in the end, a capture of our civilization at a point in its history. There is a reason that western civilization is the dominant civilization in the world - for its emphasis on Liberty, Liberalism (the traditional kind, not the corrupted modern kind), and Opportunity. And the British Empire played an outsize role in shaping today's world.Victoria and Abdul is a capture of that. An excellent one.",Victoria & Abdul

84,m-ozfirat,Compelling and Enjoyable,10,26 September 2017,This epic film which I saw in the Cinema is an outstanding tale about the real life (mostly) as in the start credits about Queen Victoria and her Indian Servant Abdul Karim. first there was Victoria and Albert now the sequel. The film starts with how the Queen met Abdul and how their close friendship was formed despite the court antipathy shown to the relationship. The Queen learns about India and its culture directly through her servant Abdul who even teaches her Hindistani. The film focuses on real events done with a good dramatic setting suitable to the times with scenes on Royal Banquets and Plays in relevance to the story and its relation to the historical basis. The chemistry is works between the two main characters and the leading antagonists who scheme in every way to oust Abdul reflecting the colonialist mentally of the time. Contrary to the age of Empires being called Victorian the figure who the era of the 19th century is named after was not colonialist at all and this separate and fair portrayal of Politics and relationships are deeply demonstrated. My one complaint is the better way for the film to capture the Anti-Muslim sentiments of the time would be to demonstrate Europe's relationship with the ruling Turkish King Abdul Hamid at this who was the Caliph with demonstrations from prominent imperialists such William Gladstone with direct references to the Sudanese Mahdi and the Indian Mutiny. The end scene is very captivating and visceral when the Queen dies and Abdul acts like a son to her more then her heir the future Edward VII did. To add insult to injury all the books to which they had learnt Hindistani are destroyed saving only a priceless hidden relic with Abdul returning to India remembering the good times with Victoria. This film acts as respectable tribute to a remarkable relationship that is as relevant today as then with one man's silent story finally to the world.,Victoria & Abdul
85,thirtyfivestories,Bitterness Stifles Advancement,6,19 October 2017,"Mohammed and Abdul are plucked from their livelihoods like plush toys cradled by a claw. An insignificant coin must be presented to the Queen of England by authentic Indian men for some apparent reason. This exchange is to be done in person, and this homey pair will cross hemisphere lines to fulfill a culture quota.Both men are aware of the atrocities that the British Empire has carried out on their homeland, but take different approaches in displaying their distaste. Mohammed is a blunt viper with little tolerance. He is beyond justified in his insults, but sleeping in the royal palace dulls his temper.Abdul has developed a strange admiration for his abductors. He wishes to shape a hybrid history that waters down both the oppressors' actions as well as the natives' reactions. Once in the Isles, Abdul becomes enamored by colonization, and draws parallels to his own country's vivid ledger of creative borrowing.This whimsical attitude of inclusion leads to one of the most unlikely friendships of all time. A simple glance upon her majesty, and a Hindu coin-bearer opens a door to cultural exchange that will influence the very architecture of the palace he was booked for an one night stay in.Victoria has reached the down-slope of her storied lifespan. Every soul that she truly loved has vanished into sleep, and she is awfully tired. Once an ambitious and vicious ruler, now a pile of apathetic hunger. Napping between dishes, finally a sight crosses her plane of vision interesting enough to indulge in.The pair exchange language, food, and art at a ferocious rate. Class struggles dissipate on a daily basis, and the marginalized subcontinent holds the attention of the most powerful woman in the world. Their spokesperson is a dangerously optimistic Muslim whose boldness irritates everyone except the one who sits on the throne.",Victoria & Abdul
86,ravitchn,Cliches abound!,5,9 March 2018,"While the acting here is very fine, particularly that of Julie Dench as the old queen, the plot is weakened by two very contrary cliches around which the entire story revolves.First, the cliche, and all chiches are partly true or they would not have become cliches, first the notion that the British in the Victorian period were racist about colored people even though Britain had millions of them in their African and Indian possessions. The hostility towards Abdul the Muslim Indian companion of the old queen was shared by the royal family, especially by the future Edward VII (Bertie) and by the staff in the palace who took care of the queen's every need. They felt insulted by the presence of an Indian colored man in their neighborhood and tried to coerce the queen into letting him leave. The second cliche is that of the alleged immense philosophical wisdom and religious insight of the Indians, no matter how lowly their origins. The queen regards every word out of the mouth of Abdul as brilliant, philosophical, and worthy of deep respect. Of course the west has long been misled by the apparent religiosity of the Indians, but these were always Hindus not Muslims and Abdul is a Muslim. This become relevant later on in the plot, but the notion that Indian Muslims, the lowest of the low after the fall of the Mughal empire, were worthy of respect for their thought is ridiculous. So here we have the typical western attraction in the person of the queen for Indian thought. Yes, India is the most religious country in the world; it is also the most dirty, the most dismal, and the poorest. Sensible westerners do not stand awestruck by Indian thought, which is usually self-righteous and oblivious to the real faults of Indian culture. You can admire the Taj Mahal, as Abdul urges the queen to do, but there is much more to India than a couple of beautiful palaces. The story is interesting to be sure but the two major cliches make it in the end rather less than worthwhile. Edward VII comes off very badly; he was not a bad bloke, he just got tired of wating for the queen to die and for him to become king. Charles Prince of Wales today is in exactly the same position, but Queen Elizabeth is not foolish enough to become enamored of some Indian fellow with alleged wisdom. She is probably more queenly than Victoria.",Victoria & Abdul
87,gbkmmaurstad,The Unmitigated Gall,8,15 August 2018,"India was under British rule from 1600 - 1947, less than half by direct British rule and the remainder by princes who ensured British rule was observed. In June of 1947, Queen Victoria celebrated her Golden Jubilee. In honor of the celebration two men from India are selected to present the queen with a gold coin specifically made for the event. One is Abdul Karim. The Queen has grown increasingly lonely since the dealth of her husband and bored with her mundane duties. When Abdul presents the Queen with the the newly minted coin she appears to be instantly taken with Abdul. He eventually become her Munshi, a term used in British India to describe a person who is a teacher or secretary employed by a European. Abdul spends the next 15 years as the Queen's Munshi and confidant. Over the course of time he gains the prestige and privileges reserved for royality and family. It is at a time when social and racial prejudices exist within not only the royal family, but the staff as well.

89,HillstreetBunz,"Half good Half bad, hides behind artistic licence",6,11 April 2020,"The movie starts with a title that says 'A true story....mostly'.
This makes criticism challenging in so far as it is a caveat that allows the screenplay to take any liberty with any aspect of history, evidence, culture, language, time or space, that the director so chooses.
Nonetheless, despite the obvious strengths (performances, costumes, continuation of 'Mrs Brown' etc) I will try....
The earliest scenes depict preparations for a royal dinner. All the courtiers are immediately flagged as pompous, arrogant and spineless. Quite a directorial feat but in service of silly one dimensional aims. Some historical truths (the convention of eating at the same speed as the Queen for example, are exaggerated as if the dinner guests are sat at a medieval banqueting hall). British stupidity, is immediately and for the first hour, contrasted with the 'other Hindu', who travelled to England with Abdul Karim, a man who speaks with the voice of a modern Indian nationalist who studied racial politics.
It's a clumsy and absurd counterpoint. To our modern sensibilities the British Empire and everything in it is up for ridicule or anger or both, but to apply such a sensibility retrospectively is patently false. India's history with Britain was long and complicated, and the reality is that it was not a single nation before the British colonialisation, and the positions espoused by Abduls companion shriek so falsely because they do not in any way ring true for their time. India and Indians had (and have) an ingrained class system of their own (caste) which is one reason they aligned so well with the hierarchies of British colonial rule.
though there were always resisters, their political positions werent straight out of a millennials 'shock horror two legs bad four legs good' textbook.
To treat the audience so disrespectfully, to presume they need to be assured of the dignity of the Indians in question and reminded of the fundamental stupidity of the empire undermines the film at the outset and remains its weakness throughout. Giving himself a 'get of jail free card' with the title card is not a sufficient excuse for the clumsy, leaden, polarized perspectives delivered through a not very smart 2017 lens. I knew quite a bit about AK and the Queen (😉) but there are many things I don't know, so combine that with the title card that allows all deviations from historical truth and it is difficult to criticize anything but performances. But I do. Fundamentally, it simply doesn't ring true, even when I know it is, because much is designed to meet current ideological expectations of cultural respect etc. the sort of film that makes me appreciate films I hated, but which told the story without an eye on the pc critics columns that would follow.",Victoria & Abdul
90,PeterHerrmann,Too much stereotyping,5,7 March 2020,"8 stars for acting. 2 stars for the stereotyped and cloying portrayals (not just of Victoria & Abdul). So average = 5 stars. As for historical accuracy, who can say? (I didn't read the book upon which this was based). It is hard to swallow - but perhaps there was some truth. From what I've read of the actual Victoria, she had a mix of some very humane values (anti-slavery, etc), and rather low-brow tastes & mediocre education: so the eloquence of her speeches in this film are likely due to the script writer. But, the sentimentality and pap made me want to turn it off mid-way; the only reason I watched to the end was as a courtesy to my wife, who seemed to be enjoying it. Also, there were too many well-know other actors in this - which is almost always an indicator of an inferior film.",Victoria & Abdul

95,kevin_newdirections,Sweet take on colonialism,7,4 October 2017,"It is quite remarkable that back in 1997, Judi Dench earned her first Academy Award nomination as Queen Victoria in the British drama Mrs. Brown. Twenty years later, her career comes full circle as she reprises the role in Stephen Frears' Victoria & Abdul. Focusing on her twilight years, the queen has grown to be a self-confessed cantankerous and dispirited woman - a narcoleptic who struggles to stay awake during an honorary lunch. It is a role that's surprisingly stripped of vanity and to think that Dench will give something less (after having played the role before), her insanity speech towards the end tells that it would be unwise to rule her out in the coming Oscar season.If strictly taken as a comedy, this film bears a positive message. We witness one of the unlikeliest friendships to go down in history - Queen Victoria and an Indian peasant named Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) whose sole business in England is to deliver a ceremonial coin as a token of gratitude for her reign. Next thing we know, the Queen has taken a liking to the servant and he quickly gains rank in the household from a servant to her personal munshi(i.e. spiritual adviser). ""Everybody I love die and I just went on and on. What is the point of all this?"" the queen cries to which Abdul responses with, ""Service, your majesty. We are all here for a greater purpose."" It is actually quite beautiful to see two worlds colliding, a moment when the audience briefly forgets the concept of imperialism. No race, religion or culture is subordinate to another when it comes to changing one's perspective in life.However, the problem with having this jaunty theme is that it operates on a subject matter that can never sugarcoat colonization as... adorable. Albeit colonialism is considered to be a relic in the past, its offspring racism remains to be prevalent in the society and others can easily take this film in the context of ""whitewashing British imperialism"". The Queen's bond with Abdul may be more of a mother-foster son relationship, but this again is susceptible to misinterpretation. By treating Abdul as the Queen's ""exotic pet"", what does he gain apart from the great privilege of serving her? Is the special attention enough to make him oblivious to the horrors of British colonialism? The fault lies on the two-dimensionality of Abdul as his motives are not fully-fleshed. Abdul's Indian friend complains that the British empire has done little favors for their country so where does his puzzling devotion for the Queen truly come from? Abdul has always been presented in a cheery perspective but the film never really traces back to his domestic life to justify this disposition. Lee Hall's script is on the account of Abdul's journal found only in 2010 and it will be a stretch to paint the whole story with that source material alone. The film acknowledges its limits as the opening disclaimer confesses, ""based on true events.. mostly."" Viewers are expected to take everything with a grain of salt. When the film starts to show that it can't even get its facts straight - the Queen's secretary blurts out, ""But mangoes only grow in India!"" (Uhm mangoes grow in most tropical countries too!), the authenticity is further reduced. I am inclined to believe that more elements of this film might be fictional than what I expected to.Victoria & Abdul is worth seeing for its impeccable costume and production design, its leads' endearing chemistry and Frears' delicate directorial touch. It aims to be poignant yet refreshing as it is more invested in laying out the dynamics of imperial households than tackling more serious topics on hand. Perhaps the film works best if treated as a satirical revisionist period piece, otherwise it just settles for a crowd-pleaser that gives the perception that colonialism is oh-so-charming when in reality, it is anything but.",Victoria & Abdul

100,michael-young-585,Dench is Terrific,6,8 March 2018,"Judi Dench runs away with this movie. In fact, she hits the ball so far out of the pack, that the rest of the actors are left with little more than eating dust. It seems that I enjoy her performance in every movie I've seen her in, whether its strong British characters (in movies like the James Bond Skyfall, or as Queen Victoria in this movie) or introspective people with pasts to reconcile (as in Philomena, or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel). She seems to personify the older British woman, bound by tradition, but bursting with inner feelings. Although nominated for acting Oscars seven times, she won only once, for a supporting role in Shakespeare in Love in 1999.Why she wasn't nominated for this movie, I don't know. I haven't seen any of the other female-actress-nominated movies, but find it difficult to imagine superior performances. Instead, it was nominated in two, below-the-line, categories - Costumes, and Makeup. And I have to confess, up-front, that I have some difficulty with these two categories. My complaints center around the fact that these nominees almost always play on the overly conservative side of things. Instead of rewarding the creativity that comes with designing clothing for major science fiction and fantasy movies, like Star Trek or Guardians of the Galaxy, the nominees in these categories tend to the period piece movies, or as is the case too frequently with the Makeup and Hairstyling category, with movies that are simply insults to the intelligence of the average viewer (I think specifically of the 100 Year Old Man Who.... from a couple years ago where the 'makeup' centered largely around a scrotum and testicles that hung so low they nearly dragged on the floor.)The makeup in this movie isn't that disgusting, and the wigs and facial makeup for, especially, the members of the British royal family, are convincingly done and add to the fun of the movie. And the costumes are all perfectly appropriate for the Victorian age. So I suppose the movie deserves the spotlight in those two categories, although it didn't win an Oscar in either.Victoria & Abdul is the story, 'mostly' based on fact, of the friendship that develops between Queen Victoria and a Muslim from India. As unlikely as that sounds, it apparently occurred in the few years before her death and caused quite a scandal within the royal family as the influence of a Muslim wasn't considered at all appropriate in Britain at that time (or now either?). The movie starts as a sort of comedy with the juxtaposition of the Queen's highly formal lifestyle with the care-free life of a low-level prison clerk from India. The improbable circumstances of how he meets the queen, are definitely the stuff of situation comedy. And Dench's remarkably adept portrayal of the banalities of queenly formalism is the straight-man to Abdul's devilish grin and refusal to obey even the simple rule of 'Don't look at the Queen!' But he does look at the queen, and her eyes catch his. In the next moment the delightfully droll octogenarian is commenting about how handsome he is and arranges to have him become more involved, platonically, with her. Eventually, he becomes her ""munshee"" which is sort of a Muslim spiritual teacher. In addition to teaching her Urdu and basics of the Koran, he succeeds in bringing out her spirit and enriches her final days. All of this occurs while the Queen's family and staff remain quite properly aghast at what is a consuming scandal.The comedic aspect of this movie, however, can't be sustained and I don't think the transition to the real drama of the relationship succeeds very well. Part of that might be the writing. Lee Hall wrote the screenplay based on a book by Shrabani Bass. Hall was nominated previously for his adapted screenplay of Billy Elliott, but I don't recognize any of his other credits. And the director, Stephen Frears, was nominated for The Queen in 2008, and The Grifters in 1991, and also directed Philomena, Dangerous Liasons, and Dirty Pretty Things. Unfortunately, this movie does not live up to some of his better work.The reason, I suspect, is that, like so many movies with just one or two nominations, this movie lacks balance. Ok, the costumes and makeup is terrific, and Judi Dench is nearly outstanding, but that's about all this movie has to offer. It would have helped, I think, if Ms. Dench had a better actor to work with her. Abdul is played by Ali Fazal, who is best known for a smaller role in Furious 7 and roles in Bollywood movies and television, but no real presence on Western screens. That he is tall and good looking is a given, but he is not a tier 1 actor. As a result, his interactions with Dench appear stiff at times and contrived. Frequently it is difficult to tell whether he is trying, maybe a little too hard, to be funny or is expressing a more serious moment. Dench deserves a stronger partner.Although far from a perfect movie, it is still fun to watch. Judi Dench's performance is worth the time, and, especially in today's age of religious and ethnic prejudices, it is encouraging to see a story like this one which at least attempts to portray the power and significance of human relationships. The Queen does die a happier woman because of Abdul.Recommended for Dench's acting, costumes and makeup, and a lighthearted, warming story.",Victoria & Abdul

108,dougiesantarosa,A daring film shows us to steer clear of the British Royal Family,10,30 July 2018,"All while watching Victoria & Abdul ""There but for the grace of the God."" kept roaring through my brain. Glad to have never been a member of that bunch. A fine film very revealing too. When she has the Durbar Room built with elaborate carvings and a carpet from Agra, hanging portraits of Indians around the House, she tells the household she wants to give Abdul a knighthood. That starts Bertie, the Prime Minister, the court physician, Lady Churchill, et. al. to find a way to get rid of Abdul. They present Victoria with a dossier that shows he's ordinary and poor. When she asks the doctor to examine Abdul to find out why his wife hasn't become pregnant, he tells her that Abdul has gonorrhea hoping she'll get rid of Abdul to dismiss him in disgust. But, Victoria remains loyal to Abdul and tells her courtiers to stop plotting against Abdul. Bertie tries to certify Victoria as insane. Then Lady Churchill gets the household to tell Victoria if she doesn't get rid of Abdul, they'll resign. When she is told, she angrily summons the whole bunch of 'em and demands that if anyone wants to resign step forward. Of course, they all stand there with their thumbs up their asses, so she tells them Abdul is staying and instead of knighthood he'll be on her next list as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. As she ages and falls ill, she tries to get Abdul to go back to India because she knows what Bertie will do to him. She warns him that after she's gone, they'll turn on him. Abdul says he's not leaving. When she dies, Bertie takes charge as Edward VII. He burns all of the gifts and papers Abdul received from Victoria, sends him and his family back to India. It is revealed that Abdul lived in India until his death in 1909. By the way the scene where Abdul tells Victoria that the Indian ""mutiny"" (rebellion) in the 1850s was caused by resentment of the British behavior, including racist intolerance, Brit-style social rules, harsh land taxes, treatment of some rich landowners and princes - think South Africa apartheid and the horrific treatment of blacks in southern U.S. - it was accurate. Many Indians rose up against the British, but many others fought for the British, and the rest obeyed the British rules. So, when Victoria reminded the Prime Minister and Bertie what Abdul told her, she was correct and they were misinformed. There was exceptional cruelty inflicted on both sides. British officers and civilians (including women and children) inflicted intense beatings and killings on the rebels and their supporters (sometimes including entire villages) but the rebellion proved to bring an important change in Indian and British history leading to the end of East India Company in charge of India, and forcing the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the whole administration. In 1858 Victoria issued a proclamation. Even though lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, it promised rights similar to British subjects. In the following decades, when these rights were threatened again not always forthcoming, Indians pointedly referred to the her proclamation and a new nationalism.",Victoria & Abdul
109,EinatB,I'm disappointed because I expected more from this movie.,7,8 December 2017,"Mainly for two reasons: 1) There were a few scenes (dialogue level) in which Abdul told the queen ""half truths"", or let the queen assume things (Victoria referred to those things while talking to him) without correcting her. Also, a few scenes Abdul had with another Hindo named Mohammed discussing the British people. 2) The romantic tinge being hinted over and over again.And there are a few more things, but mentioning those might be spoilers.Was Abdul a good guy? - OR was he an opportunist taking advantage of an old lady and the British people who took over India? I do believe he cared for her on some level, but that's the question I am going to take from this movie.",Victoria & Abdul
110,FlossieCat,People wearing historical costumes but behaving as they would today.,3,10 March 2019,"The title says it all. Historical characters behaving and speaking exactly as we would today. It's the equivalent of giving Spartacus a mobile phone!Lee Hall is an excellent scriptwriter and has written some memorable film scripts (Billy Elliot and War Horse) and his radio dramas are superb. Stephen Frears is likewise a fine director.You therefore have to ask, ""What went wrong""? Were they having an off day?Or have I completely misunderstood this film? Was it intended to be a comic take on this historical relationship?The film certainly had plenty of laughs. We had Bertie telling his mother they would certify her (as if). Mohammed offering to ""dish the dirty"" and then lambasting the Raj while the Prince of Wales stood right next to him.However, best of all was the scene with all the Palace household staff (including servants) plotting against Victoria because of her proposed knighthood for Karim, and being exhorted to oppose her by Dr Reid (Paul Higgins) channelling Jimmy Reid (the Red Clydesider and leader of the Govan shipyard workers in the 1970s).All we needed was for Dr Reid to tell the rest of the Palace staff that ""there would be no bevvying"" and the impression would have been complete!We also had various equerries and officials behaving like characters from a third rate comic opera. Which is another thing, why was Puccini singing? He was a composer, not a singer. Or was a cameo role by Simon Callow a touch of ""luvviedom""? He wasn't in Mrs Brown but he and Dame Judi were both in Shakespeare in Love. Eddie Izzard is also a fine actor but I didn't feel his heart was in this role and where was Princess Alex throughout all his visits to his mother? She was his wife and Princess of Wales.The time line was also very confusing, especially as Victoria started off very old and didn't seem to get any older. Was she really that doddery in 1887? She was only 68!Overall, and to quote the former Sunday Times film critic Elkan Allan, ""Don't waste your time.""",Victoria & Abdul

Of course they had to twist it a bit but that was to give it the humorous spin. Bertie is played brilliantly too!

In her death bed scene there is no Arch Bishop of Canterbury and no mention of Christ or Christianity. In their place is a Sufi Muslim quoting from Rumi with the implied view that Muslims are a peaceful folk and that Victoria died a Muslim with no savior.The movie could have been a good one with superb acting by Judi Dench and many light-hearted and funny scenes but it was flawed by the politically correct author, director, producers, and screen writer who want to push their anachronistic/pc views through a period piece.What a shame that these kind of movies always have to be flawed by faulty worldviews that seem to be always anti-Christian and anti-Western.",Victoria & Abdul
114,judysimon2002-232-622958,This film shows the worst of British class snobbery!,9,5 July 2019,"This is a story of a tender yet improbable friendship. The greed and two-facedness of those within Queen Victoria's inner circle is toxic. She has nothing to live for and knows that the vultures are circling around her, waiting for her to catch her last breath. Everyone around her is fake. They dare not look her in the eye; she will see through the window to each soul. It isn't surprising that Queen Victoria dresses like one who is mourning. I don't blame her. She lives in a world of indifference, and skulduggeryBut all that changes when by, happenstance, a lowly Indian, Muslim man kisses her feet in utter adoration. The two lock eyes; hell freezes over.Victoria and Abdul is a story of friendship, vulnerability, class, and undeniably, racism.Coming from a former British colony, I could empathize with Abdul's character. His genuine devotion to the Queen comes from a place of dignity in service. He doesn't understand the English snobbery, nor does he want to be part of their world. He and Queen Victoria connect on a human level, something that no one else can understand unless they aren't driven by the ego.Watching this movie has been a treat. I love Dame Judy's acting, with how it compliments Ali's. Watching these two connect was like being in the front row seat of a beautiful dance.Sadly, English class snobbery continues to date.",Victoria & Abdul

I decided to take him to Victoria and Abdul to see if a story about British Royalty would interest him. It did. He never was bored and loved the story. He chuckled quite often at the sharp English wit.While mostly a light movie about an unlikely pair, there are some very emotional scenes and even a few twists that I did not see coming. I am going to take my wife to go see it this weekend. She loves Downton Abbey, so she should really like this. If you like somewhat authentic historical fiction with some great acting and a view from both the royal and below stairs side of life at the time, this is for you.

The makers have taken quite a few liberties, but overall the movie has been well made. Judi Dench does a fantastic job of Queen Victoria and the entire UK court intrigue is well constructed and shown. Ali Fazal has also done a very creditable job playing the subservient agent of the empire. The attitudes of both the British and their subjects has been correctly typed.

Judi Dench is so believable as Queen Victoria, you'd have to pinch yourself not to believe it. She is at the top of her game showing the audience that she is quite the Sovereign of a Nation and demands the respect of the people she works for. Ali Fazal is perfect in his role as ""Munshi"" (her humble teacher and friend). It's easy to watch and flows beautifully. Just lovely with great teachings.",Victoria & Abdul

It seemed as if a new perspective had been depicted on the subcontinent and the British attitudes towards her colonies. However, this film does not feel real at all. It seems the Queen follows Abdul blindly; this seems strange for a lady who was the Empress of India. Although it is a true story, I feel they could have done much more with the movie so that it would feel real at least. Or maybe the relation between the two was quite unreal.",Victoria & Abdul

Kudos also to both the costume and production design where the viewer is able to admire the beauty of art in their forms.To conclude, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a good story that contains both dramatic and humorous moments in it.

Secondly, I'll say that Dame Judy Dench and Eddie Izzard are great, and...well that's about it. In my opinion, Dench and Fazal have absolutely no chemistry. The whole movie I kept waiting for something to connect these two in a way that would feel meaningful, and it never came. I kept thinking, ""Why would this woman care so much about this man?"" He seems to relish her presence and her his...but why?He treats his friend like absolute garbage and he just seemed like such a selfish individual, even with his childlike wonder about royalty, he just never seemed to ""get it"".Go back and watch Mrs. Brown to see a better Queen Victoria story.",Victoria & Abdul

Bollywood star Ali Fazal is completely believable as the young foreigner who brings light and laughter back into her life, and Eddie Izzard is amazing as the scheming Bertie, Prince of Wales.Stephen Frears directs this masterfully with beautiful cinematography, but I found the movie a little unsatisfying in that a very political issue- that of racism and exclusion- was a little downplayed. I would have liked to have seen how the changes of the Industrial Revolution had contributed to this xenophobia, and how our modern equivalent- whether you want to call it automation, the robot revolution, or just climate change- may be contributing to similar political movements today. Will we be able to explain Brexit, Trump's presidency, and the anti-immigration policies of Australia for instance, better in 100 years than we do now, do you think?So in summary, a good movie, not great, as it could have been had it been a little braver.",Victoria & Abdul

Until we found that it is a biography and mostly fact. That made the story even sweeter.Dame Judy Dench's acting was peerless as usual, but by far the biggest revelation was Ali Fazal, who put in a wonderful performance from comedic through emotionally intense.There was so much I didn't know about Queen Victoria's twilight years that this movie put into perspective, in a way that was consistently entertaining.

What may have passed for diversity of opinion once upon a time is banished these days in favour of politically correct characterisation across the board. It's now obligatory to portray he the British upper class as either dim-witted or venal and hateful (it makes you wonder how these stupid people managed to create the biggest empire the world had seen), whereas people of colour are invariably noble and with the best of intentions. So it is here with Stephen Frears' lastet fictionalised account of Queen Victoria's attachment to her 'Munshi' in the final years of her life. It's uncanny how her character reflects exactly the 'feelz' of the millennials! All this diversity and tolerance (especially of Muslims and their customs) from an aristocratic woman born at the beginning of the 19th century. Amazing!",Victoria & Abdul

A lot of the plot is authentically filmed at Osborn House, where the events really happened. But it's ruined by an achingly 'woke' perspective, and a heap of anachronisms.There was huge potential here: Judy Dench plays Queen Victoria so well; and Ali Fazal fits the bill as a ""handsome Indian"" as well as playing his part brilliantly and likeably.Unfortunately all the other characters are two-dimensional caricatures,the Royal Household, the Prince of Wales, and the Prime Minister all pompous racists with no redeeming characteristics.

This movie has a great dynamic of light-hearted funny scenes that can make you laugh, but also some really heart-felt ones that could result in a tear or two.This movie completely takes you into a different time and place through fantastic costume and production design. It's nothing short of remarkable to let this movie transport you into a different era and just enjoy the story that's unfolding in front of your eyes.There's also a fair share of great acting throughout this movie. To no one's surprise, Judi Dench is phenomenal as Queen Victoria, but Ali Fazal should not go unnoticed as he shows a good range and gives a very charming performance in this movie.Most of the things about this film were easy to enjoy. The score was good and fit the story nicely, the cinematography was good (with a few scenes being shot remarkably well) and Dench truly knocked it out of the park.One flaw I have with the movie would be the way that the characters were developing throughout the story. I had a somewhat difficult time really getting into the relationship between Victoria and Abdul.

The sets are very realistic. The humor is slick.",Victoria & Abdul
139,penname90,Disappointing,1,24 April 2019,"Some of the humor I appreciated; HOWEVER, I could NOT get over the fact that they represented all of the British people as ignorant morons all the while putting Abdul and Mohammad on a pedestal of dignity--and worse the movie represents Islam as some sort of lovey-dovey and noble religion. Which if you have even a cursory knowledge of History you know that is very far from the truth.I would have been able to swallow some liberties with Islam, but for goodness sake...it was completely inaccurate. We all know that Islam has it's problems...and people should know the Koran is completely in support of murder of those who do not believe Islam hence the term ""infidel"", killing women for ""honor"", and lying if it advances Islam.When Karim is caught lying about the rebellion in India that was as close to the truth as this movie ever got. Of course a Muslim would lie to advance Islam, the Koran tells them to do this.They present the full burka in a completely sympathetic light! The full burka is just as disrespectful to women as lewd clothing is! No, wearing a bed-sheet in public is ridiculous. It's also uncomfortable (I have been told this from a Muslim woman),although it doesn't take great leaps of the imagination to see how uncomfortable it must be--as well as oppressive and offensive. The burka is an insult to the dignity women everywhere. I can especially imagine how horrible it would to wear in India--if your husband let you go outside! How absurd to represent the burka and how the women are treated in this movie as dignified.To clarify-- it's not just a head covering or modest dress--which is very dignified, but the burka that makes them look like walking bed sheets. Awful.I went into this knowing some historical liberties would be taken, but the Muslim people are not hippies. Allah has 99 names--non of which include ""lover"" or ""father"".Islam when taken literally and seriously is murderous, conniving, and forceful. It is not about ""freedom"" or ""love"". If you are to believe that Karim is a representative of Islam you would be asked to believe that Islam inspires men to be docile and think the world is ""an adventure"". This is so completely false. I wanted to like Karim; and if they had made him interesting as a MUSLIM not as some wishy-washy and dishonest representation of Islam, well I would have been inclined.I would have liked to have seen the Queen angry with him at some of his beliefs that Muslims hold dear--like an actual conflict or realistic representation of these two people.The Queen is after-all a ""Christian"" or at least she was raised in a culture that would have inundated her with Christian beliefs. There is very little chance she would call the full burka ""dignified"". These two should have been butting heads all the time--as a matter of fact I believe that it would have been a fabulous way to build the film.The clash of cultures should have been very dramatic and it would have created a very real and dimensional relationship. For them to overcome their differences and still be friends would have meant something and been more congruous with the Queen's personality and her cultural heritage of Christianity.Making her a sad woman who only wanted to dote on a Muslim son, is ridiculous as well as boring.As far as the relationship between the rest of the crew and the relationship between Victoria and Abdul--It would have been a little easier to swallow if they made equal fun of Karim and his friend Mohammed, but no, they represented them as superior, essentially.If you have any interest in historical accuracy, or a well-rounded and interesting commentary on the historical relationship of Victoria and Abdul you won't find it here.You may chuckle a few times at the humor, but it's not worth it in my opinion. The movie goes from tolerable, to bad, to worse.There are very few redeeming qualities.

Especially in the final scene that shows the Taj Mahal, a symbol of romantic devotion, it just detracts from the actual connection Victoria and Abdul shared that transcended barriers of class, creed, color, race to connect on a human level. Abdul helps the lonely and aching queen to be her true self without the formalities of a queen and empathizes with her on a human level to comfort her, entertain her curiosity adding a new lease of life in her twilight years. It such a shame the writing and the direction tinge it with romantic tones for the sale ability factor when it could have been a precious equation between two people fighting their own battles to over come many societal barriers.The acting by the leading characters is top notch, but queen's character is a bit more fleshed out to give the dame to show her true potential where as Abdul's character could have been more engaging to hook the audience to get to know why the queen was so found of him.Eddie Izzard does the a brilliant portrayal of the heir to the throne.

145,crashblue,We all need a little diversion from the harsh news of 2017-18,9,22 August 2018,"Some say this movie was not realistic enough historically, or that a ""romance"" between the two--Queen Victoria and Abdul--is not believable. But this is not a historical documentary. It is a funny and touching drama/comedy. It kept me and my wife interested the whole way through. It was funny and did expose the arrogance of the British Upper Class. Imagine the staff's dislike of Abdul solely because he is Indian. Then found out to be a Muslim, of all things. THIS can be put in today's terms easily. The defense of Adbul by the Queen, when confronted by a staff member that she should not ""Knight"" Abdull (to increase his station at the palace, and make him safe and possibly more accepted by the British staff) is powerful. When the staff member reasons that Abdul is ""colored"" and therefore should not be knighted, an implicitly, should be tossed out of the palace, the Queen's indignation is refreshing, and empowering. It matters not whether the real Queen would have been so insulted or not insulted by this comment. It matters that the story being told is that she would be, due to her love for Abdul.Here's another one: The love between the two is unrealistic. What? That an old person could have a love for a younger man? Does the heart die because she is 82 years old? Inside she knows, I believe, that there is no real possibility of a sexual relationship with this man of perhaps 30 or so. But nevertheless she loves him, perhaps for just caring about her, and not seeing her as a ""thing"" to be bandied about at dinners and ceremonies.From Adbul's side of the relationship, I believe it is respect for the Queen, as he is well taught class structure in India. But also he finds that he likes her as a person. He sees someone who longs for a real connection to another person. He feels that he can possibly fill that void. In the film at one point he tells a hopeless, depressed Queen that the purpose in life is not ourselves, but ""service"", caring for others. In short he gives the Queen a boost, a Raison D'etre in her declining years. Perhaps if she was a younger woman she would have no room or need for this relationship. But at this point, she needs it very badly.In summary, funny. I loved how it made the bigots to be foolish, and selfish twits.

147,venkat1926-605-503357,Indian history seemed to have started only after coming of Muslims in India,6,23 September 2018,I am a non believer and not against an religion. The acting in the film is good particularly Judi Dench. But from this film it looks that Indian History starts only from the advent of Islam into the sub continent and only other Language the Empress should learn is Urudu (why not Tamil!). Even from the last scene it looks that the dying person attains peace only following Islam. Otherwise a fairly good film,Victoria & Abdul
148,Mijm95,The Lightweight Appeal of Victoria & Abdul,10,12 November 2017,"Judi Dench is again marvelous as Queen Victoria, despite the film's upbeat and historical politics.And so it comes full circle. In 1997, Judi Dench—to that point best known for her work on British stage and television, and for her first turn as Bond's ""M"" in GoldenEye—vaulted into cinema royalty (so to speak) for her performance as Queen Victoria in the director John Madden's Mrs. Brown. The film concerned the queen's close relationship with a common-born Scotsman named John Brown, a relationship that was regarded with concern and envy by her court and family.Twenty years and seven Oscar nominations later—her first was for Mrs. Brown, her sole win for Madden's later Shakespeare in Love— Dench again plays Victoria (though somewhat older) in Stephen Frears's Victoria & Abdul. The film concerns the queen's close relationship with a common-born Indian Muslim man named Abdul Karim, a relationship that was regarded with concern and envy by her court and family.It is worth noting that, despite some liberties taken, both films are based on real-life events. Victoria, who lost her beloved husband, Prince Albert, 24 years into her 64-year reign, never remarried, and both Brown and, subsequently, Karim served as important servant-companions in her later years.That is, however, more or less where the resemblances between the two films end. Despite strong performances by Dench and Billy Connolly (as Brown), Mrs. Brown was a slow and somewhat awkward period drama. Victoria & Abdul, by contrast, is an elegant yet sprightly romp— albeit one that has been justifiably criticized for historical revisionism regarding the relationship between Britain and the Raj, as well as for the relatively two-dimensional portrait of Karim.The story begins in 1887, with the Queen's Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her ascension to the throne. In her honor, a ceremonial coin is minted in India, which has been under formal British rule for nearly three decades. Two Indian clerks are chosen to present the coin by virtue of their height: Karim (played by Ali Fazal), who is in fact tall, and Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar), who is not, and was instead a last-minute fill-in.Arriving in England, the two are instructed in the niceties of the Court (""The key to good service is standing still and moving backwards""), and solid comic mileage is gotten out of the elaborate etiquette and pantomime of a state dinner. Karim is entranced; Mohammed, not so much. (""The place is completely barbaric,"" he complains, citing—in a clever inversion—the English consumption of food featuring pig's blood and sheep's brains.)Despite instructions that he make no eye contact with the queen, Karim does exactly that at the first opportunity. She returns his gaze and, later, noting his height and looks, decides to bring him gradually into her service. She asks him to teach her Urdu and to describe the taste of a mango. Soon she has declared him her ""Munshi,"" or teacher, awarded him Mohammed as a servant, and had his burqa-wearing wife and mother-in-law brought to England.Her family and ministers take this all about as poorly as one would expect: One derides her ""Munshi mania""; another declares Karim ""the brown John Brown."" (As a group, her court is played by an all-star lineup of Eddie Izzard, Tim Pigott-Smith, Simon Callow, Olivia Williams, Michael Gambon, and Paul Higgins—whose brogue is unmistakable to any fan of his role as Jamie in The Thick of It and In the Loop.)The contemporary political resonances of an Anglophone head of state striking up a deep friendship with a Muslim—even one who is essentially a servant—are obvious and unlikely to be accidental. And indeed, Karim recedes a bit in the latter half of the film, becoming less a flesh-and-blood character than a metaphor for tolerance. Moreover, however appealing this abstract ideal may be, the portrayal of Victoria as a progressive anti-racist is an absurd whitewashing of the colonial era and the British Raj.Fazal makes the most of his opportunities as Karim, and the rest of the cast fulfill their straightforward plot functions ably. But like planets orbiting a celestial body, all revolve around a customarily gravitational performance by the great Dame Dench. It is instructive to watch Mrs. Brown and Victoria & Abdul side by side. As magnetic as Dench is in the former, by the latter she has come fully into her powers. The moment when Victoria first notices Karim's gaze is typical: With scarcely a gesture or change of expression, she instantly commands the scene. Victoria & Abdul is worth seeing for Dench's magisterial performance and for Frears's light but sure directorial touch. Just don't mistake it for actual history.",Victoria & Abdul
149,sineti,Pure fiction with a political message waste of time,1,22 April 2018,"Most movies made today carry an underlying political message which is inserted in by the views and beliefs of the movie studio and producers who make the film. Unfortunately this is one such movie. The underlying political view the filmmaker wants you to believe in this movie is that the British upper class and monarchy were just a bunch of uneducated nitwits that knew nothing about India's people, religions, and culture-that couldn't tell the difference between hindus and muslims, didn't know anything about India's foods, traditions, culture etc... The movie also tries to give the message that even though the British considered themselves as the epitome of civilization and as Hindus and muslims less civilized, in actuality the opposite is true. It ridicules British culture and tradition and glorifies islam and Islamic culture, like when in the movie the queens is happily amazed when she sees women that are draped in full burqa and she (Queen Victoria) even says in the movie that she thinks a women covered from head to toe in a black burqa looks ""dignified"". I highly doubt queen Victoria thought that covering women in a full black burqa and pulling them around like cattle looked ""dignified"". The filmmaker put that in so that he can push his view on people that burqas are actually good and empowering to women, when in reality this couldn't be farther from the truth. This is just one example found in the movie of political messages the filmmaker is trying to push, but only a dimwit would not notice. To sum it up the movie wants to give you the idea that: islam is beautiful and amazing, Christianity is dull and backwards, third world is actually 1st world, and western culture is stupid, boring, and out of touch with the rest of the world. I wish they would make real movies again like they did up until the late 90's when they rarely added in political messages and instead focused on making a well thought out interesting movie for entertainment purposes and not ideological. This is why I don't go to movie theaters anymore or buy any new movies because they all carry a political message nowadays that they try to insert into people's minds instead of just making a movie for entertainment which is what they are supposed to be to begin with.",Victoria & Abdul

When one see's the name Judi Dench, one expects a movie to be of a certain calibre.. The script was lame, it seemed that it had been written for children, too childish for words.

Also, she is portrait as ugly and fat.

157,three_fitty,Brilliant - I haven't laughed so much during a film in ages.,9,21 September 2017,"I wanted to see a different film, and was a reluctant viewer, but I'm so glad I got to watch this. The cinema was mostly empty, other films such as The Kingsman were fully booked. I can understand why, the plot didn't appeal to me and the cast seemed uninspiring. Its anything but. For the first hour or so, I was in tears of laughter and joy. Dame Judy Dench is as amazing as ever and seeing Eddie Izzard was a real treat, perfectly cast as the Queen's miserable son, but it was the actor who played Abdul, who brought the show to life. His relationship with Victoria wonderful and her rebirth from a dying queen a joy to watch. There's lots of political questions this film raises, such as racism, the class system, the British Empire, not to mention Old Age and how we help our Elders. The film doesn't deal with these directly and some of them are ignored all together, but then it doesn't need to. The relationship between Victoria and Abdul gives enough pause for thought, to see where the problems lay and the mistakes of our past.Go watch it. You won't regret it and just maybe you'll get to see a film, the rarest of rare that touches the soul. Beautiful.",Victoria & Abdul

160,greenman-62051,What a beautiful movie,10,17 January 2018,I watched this off the back of previous film depicting John Browns relationship with Queen Victoria.The acting from Judy Dench from the beginning to end is glorious as is Billy Connolly.From the very beginning of this film you become mesmerised and transported to victorian England. Abdul Karim sensationally portrayed by Ali Fazal takes you into his heart and he makes you instantly want to hear more from his character. His obvious search for knowledge and to share his love of India and what it represents to him with Queen Victoria is most memorable.This keeping you encapsulated from the very off. Judi Dench in return delivers a resounding acting triumph to this and makes you throughout feel you can't miss any of her performance. A fantastic film to depict all that is great around inter racial relationships from the very highest peak and how beautiful this is and to never be taught this is wrong but that all humans are the same.,Victoria & Abdul

162,joshy_jose,Good movie,7,14 October 2017,"This movie gives a completely different picture about the queen, especially for the people of ""greater"" British empire.The movie shows monarch as a kind person who has grown out of racist attitude of those times or is it what the old age has done to her? as the story does not show the prime of her life to contrast with.She is depicted as a poor old lady who is unaware and lacks control over her empire, but carrying the burden of queen-ship. She is aware of the unawares but helpless due to her old age. She bluntly rejects governments proposal for newer colonization while prides herself being the empress of India, old habits seldom die.Movie shows her struggle to fit into the shoes of an empress of one billion subjects, while grappling with old age also finding newer perspective to life.

Moving on from that and pretending it doesn't bother us in every possible way, we take a whimsical trip with the queen and her Muslim adviser - a very dashing Ali Fazal - along the road to friendship and respect and love.
