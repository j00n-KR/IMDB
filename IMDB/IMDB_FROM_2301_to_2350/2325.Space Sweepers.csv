0,Leofwine_draca,"Basic, and a disappointment",5,13 March 2021,"As a massive fan of South Korean cinema I was looking forward to this one and tried really hard to like it, but in the end it does come across as very bland. I'm not sure if Netflix trod on the Koreans and forced them to make this accessible to an international audience but it feels extremely generic and lightweight, like a carbon copy of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY or something. I watch Korean stuff to see Korean style and the usual quirkiness, not something that could have been churned out on a production line by Hollywood. Sure, the characters are likeable enough, but the rescue story is extremely basic and doesn't sustain the near two and a half hour running time, so this feels like it goes on forever. The CGI effects are nondescript and the cheesiness becomes all too apparent as it goes on, particularly in the ridiculous ending. Not an awful film, but a disappointment given what Korea's usually capable of.",Space Sweepers
1,paul_haakonsen,An impressive space action adventure...,8,14 February 2021,"Oddly enough, then I hadn't actually heard about ""Space Sweepers"" (aka ""Seungriho"") before stumbling upon it on Netflix. And given my interest in South Korean movies, and the rather interesting synopsis for the movie, of course I found the time to sit down to watch this movie from director Sung-hee Jo.And color me impressed. Wow, this movie was a blast of a movie. It was fast paced entertainment from beginning to end, but the movie also had a very enjoyable storyline, so it wasn't just mindless CGI enhanced action.The storyline told in ""Space Sweepers"" was one that immediately caught on with me, and I am usually not one easily swayed by sci-fi movies. But ""Space Sweepers"" managed to do that right away, and it was one highly enjoyable ride of a movie. There are several aspects to the storyline and a couple of different story arches, so there should be something for everyone in the audience.They had managed to get together a really great ensemble of actors and actresses for this movie, and the lead performers Song Joong-Ki (playing Tae-ho), Kim Tae-ri (playing Captain Tang), Seon-kyu Jin (playing Tiger Park), Hae-Jin Yoo (playing the robot) and Ye-Rin Park (playing Dorothy / Kang Kot-nim) really were so nicely cast for their individual roles and delivered greatly for the movie.Visually then I was more than impressed with ""Space Sweepers"". I mean, the special effects and CGI were just astounding and very, very realistic. It felt very much like a lived-in space setting given all the details and the wear and tear to the textures. I was more than impressed with the special effects in the movie. And with it being a sci-fi movie of this caliber, then having believable and realistic CGI is a must.""Space Sweepers"" was a very impressive and entertaining movie. And I will recommend that you take the time to sit down to watch and enjoy this South Korean space action adventure. It definitely was well-worth the time and effort.My rating of the 2021 ""Space Sweepers"" lands on an eight out of ten stars, no doubt about it. Thumbs up for this one. Way, way up.",Space Sweepers
2,phd_travel,Visually great but the story lost me in parts,6,9 February 2021,Visually this space movie is top quality film making. The sets are beautiful and stunning. The story is good in parts but lost me at some parts. Why something was happening or why they were doing this or that escaped me. The emotional connection and back story are the Korean element which helps give the characters some dimension. Wish the backgrounds and the girls story had been explained earlier to avoid confusion. The multilingual dialogue can be slightly confusing at times.The hero of the show is played by Song Joong Ki who is still boyish looking and does as good a job as can be hoped for. Kim Tae Ri does a badass role okay. The cute kids act well.The non Korean international cast is not famous except for Richard Armitage who plays the villain.It's a grand movie and looks great - just a tighter clearer story might have made this a great movie.,Space Sweepers
3,deloudelouvain,"Another good Korean movie, to change, a Sci-fi this time.",7,16 February 2021,"Action, adventure and drama, that's where this movie is categorized in, but it should definitely being categorized in the Sci-fi genre because that's what it really is. It's a first for me, a Korean Sci-fi movie, but I'm not surprised it was a good movie. Korean cinema is one of my favorites, from all the Asian countries they're almost the only ones that constantly deliver quality movies. Seungriho (or Space Sweepers for the English title) has a good futuristic vibe, a mixture of Star Wars and Blade Runner, the story is a tiny bit too long in my opinion but it's certainly enjoyable to watch. Sung-hee Jo did a good job directing this picture. Although this is an entire Korean production there are plenty of different languages spoken, which was a clever move in my opinion. I watch all movies with subtitles so it was even more pleasant to follow. I'll never get why you would watch a dubbed movie as you just lose the real acting skills of the actors. The whole cast did well in this movie, even the kid was very believable playing her character. The special effects and the sci-fi look were more than decent, they clearly put some money and effort in that section of the movie. Well done! Looking forward to watch another Korean Sci-fi in the future.",Space Sweepers
4,siderite,"A very decent effort, marred by some impossibly cheesy Asian cliches",8,6 February 2021,"Earth is doomed by pollution, so the big planetary corporation wants to create a new Eden on Mars, where only the chosen ones will be able to go. The rest are treated as subhumans and are left to fend for themselves. Meet a ragtag crew of space sweepers who, despite the name, are not really clearing up debris, but are more like a salvage crew. And of course, the solution for life on Earth falls into their lap and they have to defend it from the evil Caucasian CEO.I liked the special effects and I liked a lot how multicultural and multinational the world in space was built. Chinese, Russians, Africans, Asians, French, American people all working in space in a truly global culture where everyone speaks their own language and has translator earbuds. Lot more credible dan de Beltalowda, ke?However some of the Asian film cliches were so cheesy as to be laughable. We already have the magical indestructible nanobots that can do anything, but only when controlled by a child, the evil corporation and its sadistic henchpeople, the trope of the super pilot who can do high speed maneuvers around multiple moving obstacles without AI assistance. But we also get the shouting of someone's name while walking like a robot towards them, so enemies can do whatever they want, the teary eyed goodbyes, the endless self sacrifice scenes (which the other people don't use to get a hold of the situation and instead shout someone's name like dumbasses), the pure magical child that everybody feels the need to love and protect, the psychopathic enemies, etc. At one point my wife asked me: is this an anime? Well, it's not, it's a movie into which clearly a lot of effort was put. But it feels like an anime.Bottom line: don't expect a masterpiece of film making, but as an Asian cyberpunky space pulp it's pretty good. Certainly more effort and thought went into this than in many of the recent Hollywood sci-fis.",Space Sweepers
5,Edvis-1997,6,6,10 February 2021,Not bad at all. It was very nice movie for Netflix&Chill. It's good to see that South Korea serving nice quality. I would say this movie was a little bit too long that's why it didn't get my full attention. Visauls looked similar to Star Wars which I don't like but it's my very subjective opinion. I would recommend to watch this movie for adventures and action lover. So far it's second best movie that I've seen this year. Well done.,Space Sweepers
6,westsideschl,Good Effects - About It,4,13 August 2021,"Positive:
Special effects of space craft of every imaginable size & shape (thus failing high school science) is all that redeems this junkyard trash dog.Negatives:
You can throw everything that should pass high school out the window as structures, movements violate the most elementary precepts.Acting, storyline, intelligent dialogue not needed or essential as viewers were probably in it for the visuals.",Space Sweepers
7,Tweetienator,Solid Fun Ride,6,8 February 2021,"What you get is some eye-candy with comic characters and a more or less well-known (or over-used) story. Seungriho aka Space Seepers is a nice little sci-fi fast-food flick, that won't hurt you and give you some fun time without leaving a lasting impression. Recommended if you like such movies as Mortal Engines, Ready Player One, Alita: Battle Angel etc.",Space Sweepers
8,Vartiainen,"Valiant effort, suffers from a poorly written villain",7,1 August 2021,"The end of the 21st century approaches and much of humanity is living in poverty as the elite have risen to the orbit. A small crew of misfits are working as space sweepers, collecting junk from orbit and selling it to the Big Bad Corporation. But then they find a young girl mysteriously still alive while floating there in the void.The film is enjoyable to watch. It has a great aesthetic with lots of colour and great lighting. All the spacecrafts have that cobbled together, grungy vibe to them. All the main characters are also delightfully different from one another and the film does a surprisingly effective job in giving each of them their little moments to shine and expand upon their narratives. Very effective and organic from a film that's just over two hours long.Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the villain of the film, who's about every evil and greedy corporation boss cliché bound together by a piece of floss. I could practically finish this guy's sentences before he even starts saying them, he's that formulaic. And so is his big bad masterplan.With a better villain this could have been the big sleeper hit of 2021. As it is, it's still enjoyable to watch and unique enough to stick with you for a while, but that's about it.",Space Sweepers
9,yusufpiskin,Another Netflix Joke w/22 million dolars budget,4,6 February 2021,"The first 20 minutes were so terrible and derivative that I was close to switching the film off. it gets better after that, but that doesn't make it good. Points for effort, clearly, but more should have been directed towards the script rather than CGI and special effects.",Space Sweepers
10,Xstal,Sweep Over the Carpet...,8,21 February 2021,"Unlike so many of the shallow and unoriginal products we're bombarded with through the usual channels and distributors, this outstanding piece of sci-fi cinema brushes them aside with an imaginative story, great special effects, likeable characters and, above all, an engaging story whose message is as valid today as it is in the future earth where the story unfolds.",Space Sweepers
11,MadamWarden,SPACE WEEPY,7,15 February 2021,"Great fun space fantasy that tugs at the heart strings (well it tries to). Cheesy but great fun. Great characters, solid CGI and fair plot.Not to be taken seriously but good escapist entertainment.Well done Netflix.",Space Sweepers
12,kuarinofu,"""No robots poop"" - Captain Jang (excuse my attempts at humor + soft spoilers)",5,6 February 2021,"'Seungriho' ('Space Sweepers' or 'Victory') is a Korean equivalent of Roger Corman's Space Raiders (1983). The film is stylistically influenced by Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers (especially some of the music tracks), while some of the CG action scenes are as comprehensible as they were in Ready Player One's ending battle. The film is colorful, filled with humor for younger kids, and overall not that bad but clearly aimed at younger audiences.Well, at least for the first hour. Just when I caught myself thinking that this could've been a good animated film for kids, the film went really dark really fast. It's like they were directing the film in shifts. Wacky violence was followed by murder in cold blood with full magazines emptied into people point-blank, Thorin Oakenshield turned from Good Guy Greg into a varicose demon and tried to commit literal genocide while talking about how people are a disease almost impersonating Agent Smith (with virus respectively).Combine this with all Korean trademark stylistic techniques - intentional overemoting, heavy overacting, tearjerking with dramatic music, and more. I'm not saying it's bad per se, but clearly, it didn't work in this context because of the characters. Oh, the characters in this one. In the introductory scenes, everyone impersonates Peter Quill when he's trying to act cool, but with a serious context, and not for comedy purposes. At some point, we are told that our crew of Wet Bandits from Home Alone are in fact all very tough and hardened assassins, soldiers, and drug cartel kingpins. Obviously, this never felt believable with the style they've established.To sum it up, the film itself is not that bad and probably could've been enjoyable if they would just focus on something and not jump into multiple subplots throwing the film in many directions simultaneously. Also, these characters would fit better into an absurd and bizarre story, well, at least with no random tearjerking and the themes of genocide. In terms of audiences, I suggest that younger kids might enjoy this with a hint of confusion, while open-minded adults would still not understand what to make of it.",Space Sweepers
13,Neptune165,I'd say this movie was just as good if not better,7,13 August 2021,"The story was easy to follow and had surprising and unexpected plots. The robot was really funny and the little girl was just perfect. This was a great sci fi movie!! What a charming, great looking, energetic, adorable movie this was. Would it surprise you to hear it was made for $21 Million USD!! This movie is the best one I've seen in a very long time. A Great Sci-fi HERO movie. The special effects were beautiful. I was surprised how beautiful it was.",Space Sweepers
14,Movi3DO,Spectacular Space Sci-fi,8,19 March 2021,"Well I thought this was Star Wars Episode X for a second. A group of Korean space sweepers found a special child who was wanted by the UTS space guards. Needing money, the space sweepers tried to trade the child.The best part of the movie was the CGI and the action. The outer space looked AMAZING with colors flowing into my eyes. The action scenes were very well made and thrilling. Although I'm glad that I could see the movie on Netflix, I was kinda sad that I would not be able to watch this movie in the theater. This movie deserves to be experienced in 3D and IMAX.The story itself was pretty okay. It was not too surprising and the movie progressed in a fairly predictable manner. The characters were straightforward and typical, but I still cared for them, especially the main character. His backstory was explored the most with flashback. The other characters' were just through quick exposition. The main villain was also straightforward and mega evil.Overall, a spectacular and thrilling sci-fi. 8/10",Space Sweepers
15,Stanlee107,Space jam,7,17 February 2021,"I enjoyed this film. However I might have struggled to follow the storyline without the subtitles as it is multi- lingual from Korean, English, French, fillipino, Chinese & Russian. This would be to appeal a worldwide audience and also perhaps appease the investors. It is an ambitious feat.The special effects were decent and I loved the interaction & chemistry between the cast. The child actor is so charming and the bunch of misfits ensue there is a slap stick humour. The action scenes were interesting. This is a dystopian film whereupon hope for humanity lies upon a child.It even has a star wars type fighting. The ending is uplifting...",Space Sweepers
16,kaefab,Very good Korean sci fi flick,8,7 February 2021,"Well netflix put out some movies but they are not all good, this one is the best so far.Really good Korean Sci fi flick great action, comedy and some sad moments.Highly recommended.",Space Sweepers
17,bheadher,"Sure it has flaws, but if you stick it out...",7,5 February 2021,"...you end up not caring about those flaws.I grew up in the post WW2 influx of Japanese SciFi movies flooding the US, so I can appreciate how a foreign film can turn people off after a while...but this South Korean entry into the mix does something that I find intriguing...it grabs your attention with the production values and presentation.. Yes, it uses old worn out themes from just about every US flick ever produced, but that ends up not being a distraction since the director keeps shifting your focus...This is a multicultural movie, using actors from many different nations, and it is worth watching I think...oh, the CGI is very well done too, mixing it up with some decidedly 'Steam Punk-ish' sets too...in other words, Space Sweepers is a refreshing departure from the usual foreign fare...",Space Sweepers
18,Xavier_Stone,Made for kids age 8-16,3,18 February 2021,The dialogue and story are fairly simple and straight forward. Acting is lame. Lots of teens acting and it's a teens only movie. Nothing interesting.,Space Sweepers
19,PedroPires90,Good light sci-fi entertainment,7,15 February 2021,"✅ It doesn't take itself too serious and that is a big advantage nowadays, a time when almost any director thinks he is so special and smart with his artsy bs.✅ Light sci-fi movie, entertaining and fun✅ Great production values✅ Good acting, especially from the Korean actors⛔ A lot of clichés yes (however, there is nothing more cliché than any MCU movie but the critics still love that...weirdly they don't think the same here).⛔ I would prefer to see a more developed villain. But Musk was good enough.I want a sequel.",Space Sweepers
20,daisukereds,Watered-down GUNDAM space-opera style,7,13 February 2021,"It does mark a lot of checkboxes : Technologically advanced, visually stunning in almost every department, emotional moment/connection that make you care (even if they feel placed forcefully like a patch on a piece of clothing), props, locations, eye-catching details in their action scenes (though most of them are a letdown in comparison to what I started to expect from it).Sadly, most of the cast only do an average job even if they are very well defined and have memorable personalities. I know sometimes ""average"" is good, but I feel like they were all lacking in something.. to be pushed just a bit more. The story itself is a tad meandering and could probably be compacted a bit more by an experienced writer, giving space to higher quality scenes in general.That is to say.. I liked this movie, but I started to fantasize about what it could be instead of what it is.
I got myself excited and that's my fault. I do want to see what all the people involved in this project do next, because I honestly think they can do something that will give me goosebumps.As the title says, if you like the idea of a VERY watered-down Gundam space opera, then you might enjoy it",Space Sweepers
21,DeBBss,"Technically impressive, but lacks a good story",6,5 February 2021,"Space Sweepers is a really impressive film considering its budget of $20 million USD. The CGI and sets are great, and it really proves that you can make high quality films for a cheap price. Aside from that, Space Sweepers is pretty average. The story doesn't really offer anything new and its pretty cliched. The acting was the worst part about Space Sweepers. The main actors were decent enough, but the supporting cast gave underwhelming performances. Lastly, Space Sweepers is way too long, they could've cut about 15-30min and it would've improved the pacing by a large margin. Overall, Space Sweepers is a slightly above average film. The only thing that's holding up this movie are its impressive visuals. I'd only recommend this film if you're into sci-fi and space fights, but if you're coming for a story, then you should give this one a pass.",Space Sweepers
22,AJ_McAninch,Uneven writing but a decent cast rises above it mostly.,7,4 March 2021,"The two leads are Korean stars, backed by strong supporting cast. The English speakers are a bit better than usual in Korean films. But only just. Graphics are pretty good, but storyline is muddled in the beginning and loses its way more than once. But there is a sweet back story that becomes the main and is quite touching in how the major characters respond.",Space Sweepers
23,yankeedoo,great fun,9,7 February 2021,Decent story-acting etc and action i watch alot of korean movies-but sadly apart from few on netflix -there getting harder to buy,Space Sweepers
24,madbird-61243,6.7 is the appropriate rating,6,6 February 2021,"I watch the film for Sung and Kim. Their performance in Descendant of the Sun and Mr Sunshine is terrific. Seeing this movie, however, I get to know that Korean scientific film is far behind Hollywood. I can bearly finish watching it.",Space Sweepers
25,leesimon-26357,Wanted to love it more,7,20 October 2021,"High production values, beautiful graphics but pretty lacking overall.Not a bad movie by any means, but cheesy, formulaic, and quite stereotypical when it comes to the ""evil rich guy"" character. It's also very hard to make voice actors emote like the actors would have. Pretty disappointing... But at least, they tried. So this gets some credit from me.One giant and unforgivable problem was the terrible French. They obviously hired native-Korean speakers, native-English speakers, and people who didn't do a terrible job with the Spanish and the German. So why was the French so atrocious?? Not only was the accent offensively and incomprehensibly bad, the vocabulary was very poor. Why? After all the effort placed on all the other languages, why screw the pooch on the French?I might see it again if it was on TV. Not sure I'd invest any effort in seeking this out again.",Space Sweepers
26,rish2006,Fell short,3,16 March 2021,The only good thing about the film are the action scenes in the space with great VFX. Rest everything is disappointing - poor story and very predictable and duration is slow paced. Watch only if you've got lot of free time.,Space Sweepers
27,gareth-75442,"Dazzling effects, garbage everything else",6,7 February 2021,"Visually stunning effects, garbage story/plot, stupid dialogue & woefully amateurish acting.
Mishmash of sci-fi movies seen before, nothing original of its own apart from the heroes are garbage collectors.

28,spasek,South Korea is the New Hollywood!,8,6 February 2021,"All Hollywood can do anymore is give us CGI-fest films with no depth in character or story, or remakes that are almost all worse than their originals. Typically, the films tend to mirror the demands of their audience; people who can barely sit through anything that actually requires some attention.Korea gives us a great space story that is a bit of a mixture of Wall-E, Firefly, and Blade Runner. The film also gives us a great balance of story, character, and action. Why does the story work so well? Because like all great storytellers, they focus on the story and the characters.George Lucas once stated, ""a film with special effects and no story is a pretty boring thing."" Funny how he would actually end up going against his own proverb, and it is also true of what has happened with much of western filmmaking, as stated above.The film also has a lot of heart, which will make the viewer all the more appreciative that it isn't just an action movie. This is enhanced by veteran actors like Joong-Ki Song (Descendants of the Sun) and Tae-Ri Kim (Mr. Sunshine) as well as Jin Seon-Kyu.The movie isn't perfect, but if you want a good story, some laughs, and some great action sequences, you won't be disappointed.",Space Sweepers

This show is however a very good story with a great plot and some fantastic characters. I was stuck at home and had nothing better to do so I started watching this expecting to have to stop because it was to bad to watch or the whole thing was subtitles. I was wrong on both accounts. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and was very happy to have decided to watch it. You should watch it also if you are a fan of SciFi or just enjoy a good storyline.",Space Sweepers

For example, there are far too many languages going - even during action scenes - that the subtitles and the audience can't keep up. Overall, the movie is just way too much bombarding the screen too often. Like Michael Bay ramped up to a trillion.The story is okay. But not too original. Very cartoonish. The double twist at the end is nice though. And the movie has heart but it is excessively maudlin from time to time.I liked it for the most part. But it does have issues.",Space Sweepers

35,WatchAndSmile,Not bad at all but some issues.,6,8 February 2021,"The movie is nice overall, but it was very hard to watch at times( reviewing the English dubbed version) due to a ton of issue. Director was very incompetent and needs training. Camera work is absolutely atrocious at times and doesn't match the other, like there were 2 or more directors...
1. 24fps + artificial motion blur + artificial camera shake for action scenes = total disaster. It was beyond stupid to add artificial motion blur to any moving objects. with 24 frames per second it's just nonsense that director should be fired for. Then all the laughable camera shake during the action scenes...IN SPACE. Again , the director probably doesn't know what space is. The end result, you are watching a bunch of blur and poorly captured scenes where you just don't understand what is going on?2. Who was the ""brain"" behind a decision to film a movie in like 7 different languages?? And then to dub it in English, but ONLY the Korean dialogue??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!!?!!??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????
How hard was it to dub everything??? That just makes no common sense at all. Then you are forced to READ a movie instead of enjoy cinematic. German, Russian, Spanish, etc - what was the point??? just stupid and amateurish decision.3. Acting. Acting was good by some and bad by others. I""ve seen it before in multilingual productions. And with an amateur director, this resulted in issues because the director could not see who is good and who is not, I guess. That's the issue when some act in their own tongue. Again, poor decision that the producers and the directors should've been fired for from the start.It's an interesting story and big production budget. There were some good Korean movies made in the last few years. This is one just ruins that. Reminds me of Sirenity or similar. Quite a few things were taken from other movies and tv shows. Won't name things to avoid the spoiling, but a lot of things were taken from Hollywood movies and tv sci-fi tv shows. The story is certainly not really new,but that's ok, it's nice. Some fault was with emotional connection to the characters as there was very little development.
Current 9+ rating is laughably fake, made by 1st time reviewers as well as Koreans being proud of their country. This is NOT a 9 movie. I get it, Korea is not known for space scifi and this certainly a step up. Mixed cast was a massive issue and I hope they learned that and won't do it again. I get why...they wanted to target white folks in Western countries and I suppose they think maybe we are racists who will appreciate the movie more if we see other white(and black) folks. Childish, if true...Overall, not bad at all.",Space Sweepers

In terms of the good stuff, the Special Effects and the World they created was very impressive and mostly believable.It is about as good as the best SciFi Movies that Hollywood makes these Days. The Characterizations were okay, and there is a Twist near the end of the Movie which I really liked.On the downside, I didn't like the English dubbing, I thought it was a bit out of character on some of the Actors. The Dialogue was also a bit weird sometimes, as if there was too much slang in there to understand.Richard Armitage as the Villain was kinda one dimensional, and they never truly explained what is supposed to be.Last is that the Twist could've made the Movie great, but the People behind the Movie copped out at the last Minute to give it Happy Ending, which was sort of disappointing for me.",Space Sweepers
37,nayeemiqbal_,Action packed space sweepers,6,10 March 2021,Futuristic movie about space sweepers. The good thing about this is the inclusion of all other languages. I really liked that. The point of humanity and the exploitation of the weaker just to carry out the propaganda. Another hint to save our planet until its too late,Space Sweepers
38,silicontourist,SPACE SWEEPERS Will Absolutely Sweep Up A Few Awards!,8,11 February 2021,"Woflzrain in their review said that this was a Korean version of 'SERENITY'. I agree...bu!t Any movie that has a ragtag rebel space crew will be always be described as a 'SERENITY'. So I'm going to go a step further and say that because it became none so...because they threw in a quirky (and totally original) Robot crew member with the same dry humour of Robbie the Robot in 'Lost In 'Space'. It went back to being itself (with perhaps also a minuscule amount of Red Dwarf comedy in there too!). The dangerous girl, Kot-mim who isn't dangerous just stole the entire freaking film. You will adore her and her life aboard the ship, 'The Victory'.
This is quite simply a back to basics, thoroughly entertaining, a how films should be made experience with, the general public not regretting one bit how much they spent to go see it! The story is solid, the acting is solid and the special FX put Hollywood to shame as regards its small total budget!
American special FX movies about $200M-250 million dollars....
South Korea's first real foray into a space Sci-Fi adventure --> just over $21Million.
I've said for a long time now that Hollywood is Going to be completely outclassed by South Korean and other Far Eastern countries in the near future; China I don't think will be the leader as some say because of the many China films I watch and, no matter how good (or bad) they are, its their failure to leave out the ever present presence of , 'We are Communists and we are so happy blah, blah, blah!Summing up I would just say its a excellent time spent watching.

From the picture, to the acting, to the plot, to the effects, to the twist, right down to the dialogue. It's funny, it's serious, it's thoughtful, it's emotional, it's engaging, it's universally correct. At first I didn't understand why everybody had an earpiece on everytime, I missed the first scene with the woman, but later realized it's a translating device. Brilliant in everyway. I definitely foresee a future like that. It is clear this movie is well thought off. From the set design to the multi ethnicity. They even had a Nigerian in there, speaking English the way Nigerians speak it (PIDGIN) and that's just splendid. Great movie. I didn't want it to end really.",Space Sweepers
40,Paynebyname,Solid enjoyable entertainment,7,21 February 2021,"I've got a lot of time for South Korean cinema and TV. The series Kingdom is still one of the very best series I've ever seen, so I read the reviews and jumped on board.It's a little confusing at the beginning and almost a little zany but it is trying to cram in the characters and establish a fully realised world setting.The characters are good, the young girl is impossibly cute without descending into nauseating territory and there are some nice themes about family etc.Whilst it is set in a devasted future, there isn't too much 'humans are bad for destroying the planet' although there is a character echoing someone from today who is seemingly happy to play god under the guise of 'saving us from ourselves'.I really enjoyed this, the music, the special effects and the story. Yes, it has a flavour of GOTG but what space piratey/motley crew doesn't?I only feel bad that this didn't get a chance to smash it at the Korean box office as it certainly deserved to.",Space Sweepers

But the writing, especially the dialogue is the most juvenile I've come across ... Its dreadful ... Now most of this was shot in Japanese ( apologies if its another asian language, I'm completely clueless with languages ) so maybe the English dub is just unforgivable ... But as it goes along with the story just fine I'm guessing it was just as lacking in its original language ... Dear producers, when are you going to understand, its no good throwing money at things unless you have a well written and engaging script ...

Nanobots can only be destroyed by a hydrogen bomb, yes? That is the very reason Kot-nim needed to be 5000km away from the bomb. Yet in the end Kot-nim summoned the nanobots to protect Victory from the very hydrogen explosion that was designed to destroy it?Also the hydrogen bomb was inside the cargo hold of Victory, the explosion would be from within.

Maybe the lack of emotional gurning, talking about feelings and lectures on the badness of the evil white men differentiates it from the current crop of US made rubbish.At any rate, its fun. subtitles is a must if you are not poly lingual as there's at least 4 languages in this (that i recognized, maybe more)",Space Sweepers

71,isabellacheng,I so wanna like it more...,7,17 February 2021,"This Korean production clearly rivals Hollywood ones. Many point at Firefly as inspiration, but I would say Valerian is also a good comparison. The story is original and has an interesting premise. The CGI and set design are top notch, no question about that. The multi-lingual thing isn't too distracting to me, as I am watching it with subtitles anyway, but that actually resolves ""why everyone speaks English in movies"".The deal-breakers for me are, however, the screenwriting and editing:
Many scenes are unnecessarily long.Instead of ""show, don't tell"", they foreshadow it, then show it, then also exposit it. Say, a certain underground fight sequence. It is foreshadowed by a friend's visit, then with the knife, then the person is shown, then said person explains everything... That's too much, don't you think?The transition between set pieces is not smooth. Consciously you know they are heading to the next location to progress the plot, but the cuts are jarring.The timing of events are also quite bad. Say, in a rescue mission, the protagonist has the time to leave the ship to do a side quest, while the crew is supposed to be leaving immediately, and he manages to catch up. The finale is a time-critical mission, but there are at least two extra set pieces inserted. Then when they have just broadcasted a message out, everyone is already there somehow.The hero's realization happens too late, and too sudden. But you know it's going to happen since early in the movie, so the protagonist is being an unnecessary a**h*le throughout most of the movie.Too many plot twists. Some really obvious, some really bad. The final one was brilliant and heart-wrenching, then they have to ruin that with another plot twist and a plot hole as a byproduct.Too many plot holes. I feel like the writers have some plot milestones to hit, but just lazily filled in the sequences in between.Background characters, like people watching the news, are given close ups. But their acting are so bad/stiff...All in all, I like the concept, and I am surprised by the quality. But there are jarring holes in the execution that I just couldn't ignore. For storytelling purpose, I would say a trilogy or a miniseries are more appropriate formats for this IP.",Space Sweepers

Great production design, brilliant visual effects, and heart-warming characters, set in an imaginative and fictional fictional world, the movie has everything in place for a blockbuster franchise. It's a film that deserves a second watch to fully buy into the world-building of the story, and truly understand characters. I really enjoyed this film, even with all the flaws one can point out. Especially, a plot which is a little bit contrived and shallow. Sequences are pretty predictable, and the explanations for events/character motivations are pretty incidental and arbitrary. But, all said and done, the emotionally investing characters make up for a story that lacks depth. The original world, and the beautifully etched-out characters makes me anticipate the potential for a really good sequel. A sequel where I'm swept off my space. Kudos to the team!",Space Sweepers

This aspect is interesting and timely in light of all the current space programs in development on the real Earth. It also involves the personal transformation of some greedy pirates when they learn their stowaway is more than they thought she was. The essential problem is the characters are two dimensional.

While the plot is nothing new if you're familiar with the space opera sci-fi genre, it did bring an unique take on that concept. I would like to just take a moment and also point out that the villain was perfect, over the top, classy ruthless and not contractionary at all.My few gripes are that there were moments where I had to suspend my disbelief a bit too much, but overall this show was a fun ride all the way through, it stuck the landing.

Although the plot and the story is very similar to other movies, but many concepts represented in the movie are very unique and interesting. Of course, it has some flaws. My problem was that It looked like some scenes are missing. At some points, It moves too quickly or jumps to another without explanations.

I have questions about many aspects of this future setting, and I can see that a good deal of thought went into the movie's setting.The foreground elements are where it fails. The characters are walking cliches, over acting and miscast. Swap some of their roles around and the movie would have gone a bit better - captain for engineer, engineer to captain. The movie's attempts to pull at your heart strings are excessively saccharine, pulling out every trope the writers could muster. Cute hair. Makeup scene. Kid's drawings.The writing was all over the place, and the dialog even worse. The plot is filled with ""Why is"", ""Why did"" and ""Why didn't"" questions, and multiple ""wat"" moments. The best character to me was the antagonist, with several good lines that were well delivered. Unfortunately, they were drowned out by a multitude of worse lines and janky acting when the actor was in full view.As others have said, the editing in this movie was far too lenient. 30 minutes could be shaved off quite easily.The CGI was very good.

It's spectacular and all that, but I challenge anyone over the age of nine to put up with these characters, situations and dialogues for two and a quarter hours without drifting off.

Due to the absence of the acting style typical of SEA (SouthEast Asian) movies (extreme exaggerated overacting movements), I just assumed it was American made.Other than the majority of the spoken language being in Korean (use subtitles...), you'd never know it wasn't a high-end Hollywood blockbuster.",Space Sweepers
113,Jodie_ds,Feel good space opera at a fabulous price!,8,9 February 2021,"Space Sweepers did give a pretty standard space opera construct in the storyline, but that meant that the audience could anticipate what was going to happen and therefore enjoy the changes and the adjustments to genre, more. The was the way they treated the characters as an ensemble of people with different perspectives, who were also able to live and work together effectively, was what made it so clever.The character that in any Hollywood movie until very recently would've been played by a white male and be the lead character was in this case presented as having an incredibly flawed moral compass and the lowest in pecking order among his crewmates. The main power characters, in contrast, were an asian woman, a male who did not fit the standard norms of handsome and caring, and an android that sounded male but identified as female.It used humour in a way that was inclusive rather than targeting individuals or minorities (had some Guardians of the Galaxy vibe here) Additionally, the normalisation of multiple languages, rather than expecting that everybody would speak the same language, is a huge step forward in what is considered blockbuster cinema. Until now, it was only seen in hard-core sci-fi series, like The Expanse.Yes, Space Sweepers did have some cliche aspects, and the baddie was indubitably not fleshed out or given any reason for his actions, however that should not take away from what is a great example of how K-cinema has changed our expectations of how we should see ourselves on screen in 2021, as global citizens.",Space Sweepers

117,keithomusic,A decent movie with some big problems,6,18 November 2021,"The plot is OK, the acting, action and special effects are good/average. But this netflix movie has some big problems. First on my TV it looked like it was filmed in 320 resolution most of the time, it's annoying to have to watch a modern movie that looks like its out of focus 80% of the time. Second its a mish-mash of english and korean that can be confusing at times. I expected the entire movie to be in korean, and I tried watching it in Korean with english subtitles so the dialogue felt more natural, but only the Korean had subtitles (along with russian, french and chinese). But the english was sometimes difficult to hear and had no subtitles. I had to switch to watching this in english with subtitles. Those are the technical issues.This movie looks like it was put together with it was put together with duck tape and baling wire, which might work on Harleys but not on movies. I think this may have been meant to be a TV show and then they changed their minds. Honestly it looked liked it was rushed through the editing. Although 2 hours long this movie does not give a backstory to the villain and we have no idea why he is doing the things he does or why his body changes. We also have no idea why some things happen. This movie should have been 20 - 45 minutes shorter, and we wouldn't have missed anything.This is a movie for 12 year olds and not anyone younger, although there is no blood shown there is some implied extreme violence.Despite all that if you can put up with the long run time it's a fun ride, and it has an unbelievable ending, and then a couple of afterstories.",Space Sweepers

137,platon_mp,Definition of entertainment!,10,16 March 2021,"First of all i want to suggest a way to review movies to some gentlemen in the review section. When you rate a film it must be always compared to an other film of the same genre and not an imaginary utopia in your head. The reason i rate this movie 10 stars is because i havent seen a better one of this kind since i can remember.
The characters are likeable from the first minute, even the sidecharacters. The film makes sure that you become familiar with them, feeling you are a part of the crew before the main event starts. They all have a special personality, development and backstory witch sometimes is simple but its working.
The movie doesnt try to throw edgy jokes in your face every 1 minute (Marvel). The humour comes natural and it translates to a pleasant feeling, vibe that just makes you happy without ruining the urgency of the plot.
The action scenes, cinematography and graphics are mindblowing considering the budget this movie had (20 million) Also the world feels massive and full of life. The plot was rather simple but efficient althought i wanted to see more from the side of the UTS and the villain (Thorin :) ) who appears to a little 1dimensional and is just there to push the characters to grow. Also i think the story could be easily stretched in 2 movies using the time to breathe, closing all subplots and explaining the scientific part a little better. But i dont blame them for that since its a risk to invest in a sequel these days. They did their best to fit it all in 1 movie.
I could nitpick a few details if i was a miserable subhuman being but theres no need to do it since i liked the crew so much that i could literally watch a 10 hours footage of a normal day in their life playing poker yelling at each other and gathering space junk (It could literally become a series). If you re in to experience an emotionally thrilling, and exciting ride filled with colors you should definitely see this movie!

There is also an undercurrent of lesson on morality as well with the main antagonist. There is not much emphasis on him and his organization but that's ok.

If anything deserved to be on the big screen, it was this - shows what $24million can actually get you in terms of effects. The character development takes time, but as is the way with a kdrama or korean film, the character development is a bit of a rollercoaster ride - but if drags you and in and you become so invested in their journey.

157,bilalkamaran,Space Sweepers is a fun popcorn adventure with deeper themes,10,19 February 2021,"Highly-anticipated space opera Space Sweepers, originally slated for last summer, just released worldwide, and it's exactly what I needed at this moment. South Korea's first space sci-fi movie is set in a dystopian future where Earth is dying and the only place left to colonize is up, its world rife with the inequality that always accompanies imperial expansion. The film feels vast, expensive, thrilling, and gives me strong Cowboy Bebop vibes, which will never not be a good thing.Directed by Jo Sung-hee (Phantom Detective, A Werewolf Boy), it centers around the hapless and always-in-debt crew of the ship Victory, which seems held together with twist ties and sheer stubbornness. They're the best team of space sweepers around-part of a poor underclass of garbage bounty hunters who hunt down and haul space trash to avoid damage to space stations and satellites. The crew come across Dorothy, a robot indistinguishable from a real human child, who they're told is dangerous and wanted by both the space government and a mysterious terrorist organization called the Black Foxes.
Song Joong-ki plays Tae-ho, a man fallen from grace and tortured by a tragic loss, desperate to make money by whatever means possible to recover what's most important to him. I didn't know until now how much I wanted to see scruffy, bitter Song Joong-ki-it's great to see him doing something different from the many smooth-faced, suave and always-in-control leading men he's played in the past. Rounding out the crew of misfits are Kim Tae-ri as badass genius Captain Jang, Jin Sun-kyu as fierce-looking secret softy Tiger Park, and Yoo Hae-jin as android card shark Bubs. They're all disappointed by life and have been spit out by the empire in various ways, simply trying to scrape a living when they meet the child-robot who will change their lives. Also in the mix is the powerful genius Sullivan (a nearly unrecognizable Richard Armitage), whose Mars colony project is touted as humanity's only hope for survival.Space Sweepers is a perfect popcorn film, hugely enjoyable and full of great ideas. The world it creates in 2092 is totally believable in that it's both very different and exactly the same as ours: a planet dying due to our own exploitation and abuse; an elite class who have given up on earth and are looking to highly expensive space travel as the answer; a genius white dude who claims he will solve all our problems with technology. (Elon Musk, is that you?) Jokes aside, this is a very plausible future given where we are now, and that grounds the sillier elements of the movie in real stakes, giving the action scenes a certain weight and scariness that I wouldn't feel in, say, a Star Trek movie. Most of all, it gave me the stylishly grubby found family feels of Cowboy Bebop and Firefly without any of the alienating toxic masculinity.
There's so much visual interest in the way this setting has been imagined. I love the griminess of it all, the space trash and broken tech appropriate for a space opera with a strong environmental message. Placing Space Sweepers almost a hundred years in the future allowed the filmmakers to create technology without having to worry about explaining how it works. The production design is full of great details, like spaceships for mass travel reminiscent of commercial airplanes, the characters' salvaged and repurposed belongings, and the shiny, terrifying Space Guard armor that stands out in the dirty and dark places where they patrol and kill.My favorite of these is probably how everyone always speaks their own language, using universal translators to communicate across linguistic barriers. At first my brain felt like it was twisting itself into knots trying to reconcile what my ears were hearing with the subtitles, but I got used to it pretty quickly, and I really enjoyed seeing the movie populated by such a diverse array of peoples and languages. There's an equalizing effect to it that stands in contrast to the global dominance of English in our world today-a hegemony which still exists in the movie, but is at least mediated somewhat between individuals by the earpieces everyone wears.
The film is full of elements like that, fun pieces of world-building that also carry a subtle commentary. I appreciated its critique of the inequalities inherent to a system where citizenship is the ultimate value of a human-the way governments use narrative and military force as twin tools of domination and subjugation, and the institutionalized class stratification that keeps people in an endless cycle of poverty. That was surprising in a film which is essentially a summer blockbuster full of space battles and explosions. It's not a perfect movie-a couple of scenes with non-Korean actors felt a bit hokey, and the Korean dialogue is far superior to dialogue in other languages. The film also recycles that Korean action/disaster film trope of a father whose endangered young daughter serves as the source of all his moral development and pathos-which always gets me, but is no longer surprising.Still, the core performances are solid and moving, the aesthetics are gorgeous, and I was never bored despite the movie being slightly bloated. It's been a long, sad year for many reasons, and one small thing I miss dearly is the pleasure of going into a dark theater and enjoying a loud movie. It's winter where I live, but I feel almost as though I experienced a summer blockbuster for the first time since the pandemic started. It's a shame for the filmmakers that they weren't able to release this on the big screen, especially considering that it's the first Korean movie of its kind, but it is a nice gift to us. Sometimes you just want to see a cynical band of adorable misfits blasting bad guys and saving the day.",Space Sweepers

160,thehopefully,Special effects vs storyline?,7,14 March 2021,"As much as I would like to say I loved this movie, the storyline wasn't that impressive. The movie doesn't explain much about the characters. You get limited information about their past, but that's about it. What did amuse me, however, was the fact that the movie features multiple languages. I thought I heard Russian, Italian, English and, of course, Korean. This fits well with the movie!I would highly recommend watching this movie if you're into special effects, but, for me, it was the only thing that impressed me.So, what about the storyline? I will give you a brief summary.
While collecting space junk they (the crew) come across an abandoned shuttle that is transporting a girl. It takes a while, but their end goal soon becomes clear: clear: save the girl, save the planet. Along the way they face some difficulties. Some lunatic, who has an unexplained illness and has the power to destroy the Earth, wants them dead. This results in them being chased and shot at.
How it ends? You will see when you watch the movie. 😊",Space Sweepers

It all seems very promising... but urgh... about 1 hour in I'd had enough and started fast forwarding through it as it doesn't make sense.The dialogue is terrible as is a lot of the acting (I watched the subtitled version).It reminds me of The Wandering Earth - a lot of effort into the VFX to make it seem like a blockbuster. But a story that just goes berserk and events that just make you go ""what?"" all the time. Even making allowances for a different culture and forgiving a lot.There is clear promise. I've seen few Korean TV series to know they can make it work. But in the end... just no. This movie is a misfire.",Space Sweepers

165,badlydrawnhamster,Engaging and fun if a little Star Wars-esque,8,6 February 2021,"A South Korean sci-fi film where the earth is dying, the elite live in paradise in a huge space station above the Earth, and Mars is due to be colonised. There's a problem with space debris and all the crappy old non-functioning satellites flying about though so the poor are employed to clean up space even though it's dangerous and pays badly. In to this comes a gang of reprobates, supposedly with no moral code, who discover a robot who looks like a young child who had previously been stolen by terrorists, and rather than hand it in to the police they bargain with its owner. But then it turns out to be a super magical mix of human being and nanobots, and they all become fond of it, much to the annoyance of Richard Armitage's very over the top but still amusing villain, in this film which might not be the most original thing in the world, and some of the action scenes are highly reminiscent of Star Wars, but it is an engaging watch that I liked a good deal. I'm not overly impressed with the very final couple of minutes and certain aspects feel like a cop out, but overall this is pretty damn thrilling and likeable stuff.",Space Sweepers

I loved everything about the movie, from the cast to the storyline, including the special effects. Acting was great from the main characters (please turn off the dubbing). Few people are complaining about the CGI but just ignore them, they're spoiled from watching movies with $200+ million budget. I could only imagine what Koreans could do with that kind of money spent. And please don't make comparison to the Expanse, Firefly, or anything else because it's completely different. Only similarities are that it's in the future and outer space. If you think this is bad, watch the $250 million budget John Carter. A huge letdown! There are others I won't mention.For Korea's first space sci-fi movie I was truly pleasantly surprised how good it was and loved that there were international cast as well.",Space Sweepers

170,MRT_,I guess there is a movie hidden inside a lot of space sweeping junk,5,6 February 2021,"There is some quality hidden inside this movie, although it can probably not be fixed in its entirety.I dig the happy crew vibes of this movie but this movie is sloppy to say the least. The flaws in the story didn't bother me as much as the flaws between the scenes, this made it a particular hard watch. One moment a main actor is about to sacrifice itself and then he walks back on the bridge. Enemies and good guys seem to appear out of nowhere to give this movie an overdose of plot turns or set up scenes.You also will get sidetracked a lot into unessisary scenes that are only distracting. A lot of my criticism would be fixable by just releasing a better cut, removing distracting scenes that don't progress the storyline and removing scenes that don't tie up loose ends, and then its needs to set up the remaining scenes properly with some more dialogue, this last item would be a hard fix. This movie is probably a 4.5 and i am giving it a 5 just for the attempt and for the love of sci fi. If they would fix it i guess it has an 6 or 6.5 potential.",Space Sweepers

The dialogues are not really interesting but not too shallow either. The acting performances are ok. But some actors play very badly. Often the Chinese performers. I found Song Joong-Ki actually quite okay. The problem that I have with the film is that the film often feels like a student film, especially when music is played that doesn't actually fit into the scene. In addition, the film is way too long. 30 minutes less would not have hurt either. The film is a bit lengthy.
All in all, the movie is OK with some interesting ideas.",Space Sweepers

183,krs_is_cool,"Visually spectacular, fun, and endearing.",9,18 February 2021,"Space Sweepers seems cliché at first - ""just another sci-fi movie"". However, it's characters are relatable and endearing even through language barriers - the dubbed voices do a good job, though I would recommend doing a second watch with subtitles so you hear the original actors. Richard Armitage is a surprise (but welcome) addition to this surprisingly multilingual, yet 100% Korean film.
The set pieces are stunning - some serious effort went into crafting the various lived in spaces. I doubt it will win any Oscars, but in a year without Star Wars or Marvel, this film will definitely scratch that itch for a good space flick.
I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an entertaining sci-fi film that's a bit lighter. It's not Blade Runner, but it's not trying to to be. Stop reading this review and just go watch it, you'll enjoy it. :)",Space Sweepers

The acting is decent, the special effects are top-notch, and the jokes are funny. I got the impression that the plot isn't stitched well together in some parts of the movie, but the story rolls out fast and you'll have no problem connecting the dots. I know that the ending in this kind of movies must be ""family-friendly,"" but in my opinion, they just pushed it a little bit too far.

Beyond that though the story struggles through a lack of clear direction. Acting is OK with too many folks seemingly dragged off the streets and offered speaking roles.

This movie is absolutely beautiful, packed full of insane action, amazing sets and visuals, and complex characters you root for. I personally had no idea this was an insanely high budget film until I watched it. This is an epic space adventure film, beset in a ""hard"" sci-fi world.Netflix is terrible, but you can tell they didn't get their woke hands all over this project like so many others. A breath a fresh air to have such an original and fun story. It pushes a little bit of a climate change agenda here and there, which is just about par for the course in this genre, but for the most part the world itself is just a setup for the story of the space sweepers, and the film is driven by the characters and action vs politics.Absolutely give this one a watch.",Space Sweepers
189,Jessicat66,Very enjoyable,9,29 March 2021,"I as a big fan of South Korean film and TV watched this with my partner who is not. We both equally enjoyed it. The costumes, CGI and world design were very well done especially for a first south korean sci fi and the acting by the main cast was well done also. I would liken this film to guardians of the galaxy in that it is a film about a group of misfits with troubled pasts who find family in each other. Which may be cliche as I have seen others complain in reviews however I think this is part of what makes the film enjoyable rather than being a weakness. Though cliche themes I think that the story still felt unique to me in the way executed. And also the characters which I loved particularly the bad ass captain. Time wise this is a long film but it didn't feel like it was and it managed to keep my attention the whole way through. My only complaint which may seem strange to say as a british person, was the English (and other non korean languages) it felt unnatural and distracting to me. However I understand this was to make it more realistic. The ending did seem to set up for a sequel which I would definitely watch if one was made.",Space Sweepers

Iron Man was great, aquaman was awful. I wasn't expecting something intellectually stimulating from this, but something along the lines of guardians of the galaxy would have been fine.

192,vukicevicdora,"Entertaining, versatile and unique",10,6 February 2021,"This movie has a lovely story, characters, setting, visuals, action and a strong message that will make you appreciate our planet with unique new love.
Spiced up with cheezy kitsch aspects typical for Korean movies, depicted precisely for parts that can forgive such handling, it offers a joyful ride, seriously awesome action and effects, and an emotional thrill.
It also plays with a cult of personality and irony, sometimes on a trace of good old Starship Troopers from 97, has unique insight in a colonisation of Solar system similar to, although not as serious as, the masterpiece - The Expanse, and it takes out the best from Cowboy Beebop.
This is not a sci-fy with internal science-proof story as Stargate for example, but it doesn't intend to be bigger than it is. It's refreshing to watch as a honest, fun and touching movie.
The parts I would like to point out further is great and strong characters without that annoying 'socio-political corectness' and placing something in a movie just to be oh so modern, and absolutely amazing blend of all cultures and languages.
It evokes feelings of unity, togetherness, love, and it actually has a lot of humour, once you get used to the language(s) used. Humor, irony and criticizm of society are slided in elegantly, almost as Psy makes fun of rich Koreans in 'Gangam Style'.

They make superb movies that exist contrary to the stereotypical efforts coming out of Hollywood recently & as such are a breath of fresh air. Space Sweepers, however, does not deserve the same accolades. To begin with, I was put off by erratic behaviour from the characters as they displayed cartoon-like, exaggerated responses, behaved irrationally at every turn & would suddenly launch into fits of violence for no apparent reason. Really. It was like a bad martial arts film. The dialogue was far too rapid & to be honest I just couldn't keep up with the subtitles. The action sequences were choppy & it was difficult to follow exactly what was supposed to be going on.

212,moviesjunkies,Best Korean Sci-Fi Movie!,10,9 February 2021,"Space Sweepers is worth-watching movie. It's like The Guardian of The Galaxy but Korean version. The first thing I want to talk about is the CGI! Standing applause for CGI team because they did a really great job to make everything in this movie looks fictional realistic. It doesn't look weird at all.The second thing, the storyline is unpredictable amazing. In ten minutes you'll laugh but 10 minutes later you'll sad. The whole movie gonna mix your emotions up like riding roller coaster. Not to mention the heart-touchy climax *shed my tears*The last thing is about the diversity of the characters. It may a Korean movie but the characters are not all Korean. And yes, Kim Tae Ri as a powerful female captain! I really love to see a movie or series with bold and powerful woman character like Captain Jang. I adore her so much. She's badass! Not just her tho, all the casts are doing a great. Overall, it's a great movie! You have to watch Space Sweepers!",Space Sweepers

Fast paced action, great (if not amazing) fx, good acting, strong sense of humor (western type) and a somewhat twisted plot which is more or less a trademark of the genre.Acting is good with plenty of intense moments. What I really liked is that it was very easy to get absorbed in Seungriho (Space Sweepers) world without doubting it. The experience is immerse and intense add this an Asian flavor mentioned previously and you got yourself something really unique and rare in comparison to mostly bland science fiction movies we got nowadays.I could easily see this film being turned into a franchise into the likes of Star Trek, Star Wars, Avatar, Alita Battle Angel etc since it ticks all the right boxes but most surprisingly it doesn't fall short in comparison in any way to the previously mentioned big names.In my mind this is a little gem waiting to be discovered and have now doubt that it will.Asian cinema is really showing its teeth with this one and only hope there will be a follow up in the near future.",Space Sweepers

This move is one of the best sci-fi films that has come out in YEARS.The effects and acting are top notch, and unlike most American sci-fi that has come out recently they have not skimped on the plot (or skipped it completely). It has obviously borrowed elements from other works, but has definitely made it it's own. The feel is much closer in my opinion to a live Cowboy Bebop than anything else.This is not just a retread. It is original and nearly flawless. I 100% agree with others who have said that if this was an English film it would have like a 9.5 rating. I will never understand why people who don't want to read will watch foreign movies and then give them bad ratings.This is a legitimate epic and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.I will say that this is not really hard sci-fi, it is just well written, directed, acted, and scored. So if you are reading this and you are the kind of person who feels the need to dump on films that don't spend 25 minutes on the science, please just don't.",Space Sweepers

It was off, not perfect, and missed often. But overall, very entertaining, impressive, and promising for a whole new film category for South Korea to add to. And they have a lot now. Btw, it's nice to see a variety of countries and languages represented here, not just the usual English only which I find more realistic in a sense. Btw, it is very difficult to incorporate so many different languages and it didn't always work out. But I always thought these futuristic space stories had way too many people from only certain countries ie USA and UK. Star Wars are suppose to be aliens, not even human, far far away and they are still mostly....English speaking white people basically. No one ever thought this was odd?

239,Servillas,An amazing dystopian space opera absolutely worth the watch.,10,24 February 2021,"Space Sweepers is a South-Korean space opera that released earlier this month on Netflix. The release date had been pushed back several time, because of COVID, but it's finally here! And the wait has been worth it, as as with a runtime of 2hours and 16minutes, it's a movie to sit down for.I receive notifications on my phone when Netflix has updated the ""Coming soon"" lists, so this movie had already been on my list for a while when it came out. I really love science fiction and especially sci-fi in space, so of course I was going to watch this. I already knew I was going to love this, but I was genuinely surprised by the storytelling and visuals as they are both amazing.The story is set in 2092, and Earth is completely messed up by climate change; plants started to disappear and the air became unbreathable. A lot of people have moved into either a space station or an artificial world somewhere in orbit, a place where plants and such actually grow unlike on Earth. But the lower class and people that didn't have the right connections are still on Earth where everything is still deteriorating.You follow the crew of The Victory, a group of misfits that collect space junk to get by. But on a collecting outing, they find a little girl called Dorothy, the same girl the news has been warning everyone for as apparently she is a weapon of mass destruction. So naturally, they get involved in a risky business deal because of it.In traditional space opera fashion this movie is filled with stunning space shots and space ship action sequences and a lot more beautiful shots perfect for the eyes of sci-fi lovers. The studio that brought this movie to life did an amazing job at making the visuals as pleasing to look at as the story was to experience. I even dare to say that this movie was overall more visually striking and engaging than some other space operas, including some Star Wars movies.A detail in this movie that stood out right away was that people from all different nationalities were involved in the plot, which doesn't really happen in other end-of-the-world kind off stories. Countries as people knew them no longer exist, so everyone is just congregated together in the few places that were still livable no matter where they originally came from and that was represented in the movie. Even things like language barriers were lifted, as everyone wore this earpiece that translates conversations as they go. Most of the movie is spoken in Korean, with English coming second, but all kinds of languages and nationalities were seen and heard. It felt so natural to begin with, but it made so much sense in this context aswell and it's details like that set movies apart from others.The last thing I want to touch upon is that Korean cinematography is vastly different from what always comes out of the West. For the space opera and general sci-fi/fantasy type entertainment, this means it's a whole lot less dramatic and overexaggerated, the pacing is faster and the story is more to the point, plus it doesn't feel the need to introduce and foreshadow everything right away. This really compliments the genre and makes these movies so much more enjoyable compared to Western counterparts within the genres and sub-genres. This makes it definitely worth it to branch out to Korean media if you enjoy sci-fi and fantasy media.To make a long story short, Space Sweepers is an amazing movie, both visually and storywise. If you are into sci-fi or space stories in any way shape of form, I am really sure you are going to love this. If I have to compare it to some well known franchises, I think it leans more towards Guardians of the Galaxy than Star Wars in the terms of general vibe, plot, and in-universe technology used, but it's still a vastly different and original piece of entertainment that stands strongly on it's own.Just go watch it, it's worth it, I promise.",Space Sweepers

This Korean blockbuster gives viewers an interesting take on space and sci-fi movies, although there aren't any particularly new ideas or breakthroughs in it. The visual effects are incredible and totally immerse you in the movie's world. The Korean cast are all good actors (I was impressed by the little girl's acting), but some of the supporting cast weren't very convincing and their English was a little hard to understand (though I did watch the Korean version, so subtitles definitely helped).
Overall, I think this movie is a fun watch, with action and cool tech. It's obvious that this isn't necessarily a ""serious"" film, so taking every little thing in it seriously is only going to ruin the enjoyability of it.",Space Sweepers

246,thiago-oliv,What year???,6,6 February 2021,"The movie is a good basic space novel. All the setting is there: earth climate issues, mixed cultures (everyone speaking on their own language and being understood through technology), big corporations, absurd almost slaving economy, personal dramas, lots of new space stations and satellites, robots, space exploration as a premise (Mars soil), and even fringe new technology like nanorobots, energy beams that move large ships, artificial gravity, etc. Also great CGI, nice soundtrack, etc. Even Netflix's gender identity debate is there too. So it's full on everything. But, even science fiction and fantasy can't cope with the year of this story: 2092. What? It would far better just put a 1 insteand of that 0: 2192 or so. 2092 is too close, it kills the excitement. One thing that makes sci-fi awesome is the possibility of that really happen. 2092 is a big flaw. Not even A.I. singularity could make this whole scenario happen so fast. Or at least it's not something we can assume today. I really don't know if this year selection comes from somewhere else (like a book, or another related production), but it doesn't matter - you don't need extremely fidelity when making an adaptation.",Space Sweepers

This movie comes off as though somebody heard vague descriptions of ""Star Wars"", ""Mad Max"" and ""Space Balls"" and decided to make their own movie combining elements of them all. The CGI is impressive, but you have to have much more than visuals to make a decent movie. The story is a nonsensical mix of elements that never come together in any meaningful way. Avoid this film.

But every time these now-good-guys are suppossed to have sacrificed something/themselves in order to have saved someone else, they are magically saved...The Mcguffin in the movie is a little girl. It's funny in the begining, but it quickly feels silly.Unrealistic and superficial character-development.SPOILER: For example, one guy spends the whole movie planning to save his daughter, but abandons it on a whim in the end because he wants to go save another person's daughter with his friends - he would then be ""a good person"", he thinks.

Song Joong-Ki, whio plays our hero (Tae-Ho), and Kim Tae-Ri, the captain of the spaceship Victory are two of then most popular stars of Korean cinema, and their quality shines through along with some excellent special effects and a good supporting cast. Set in 2092, our hero works on the Victory, as a space junk dealer trying to save up enough money to search for the body of his seven-year-old daughter who vanished into space during an accident. Along comes another seven-year-old girl, Dorothy, found by the crew of the Victory and who, it is rumored, is in fact a robot carrying an ultra-powerful hydrogen bomb. The boss of the company who has made Mars habitable, a kind of Bill Gates turned seriously evil, is searching for Dorothy for his own nefarious purposes, about which I will remain silent. This puts into place a very exciting battle between good and evil, with the crew of the Victory trying to keep Dorothy out of the clutches of a corporate madman with a grudge against Earth and all its inhabitants. Don't bother finding any believable scientific basis for anything that happens in this film, it is pure fantasy and should be approached as such. But only the hardest heart will fail to succumb to the charisma of the Victory crew, the sweetness of Dorothy, and the way in which Tae-Ho rediscovers the joy of fatherhood. Space Sweepers will raise your adrenalin, make you laugh, perhaps shed a tear, and all in all provide you with two hours of compelling action and the feeling that you've never quite seen anything like this before. And remember, in space, no one can hear you fart.",Space Sweepers

Every character speak a different language.

270,antharper,"Some great ideas and CGI, but let down by the characters and plot.",6,18 June 2021,"I went into this film wanting to like it. The Netflix preview looked good; decent special effects, interesting setting, etc.The plot boils down to essentially the Guardians of the Galaxy following an Ice Age 'lost child' plot, which culminates in a 'save the earth' battle against Mr Evil corporation.Not bad on paper, but the film suffers from a lack clear tone, blending serious and goofy in a way that doesn't pace well. It doesn't help that the characters often act in ways that don't make sense given the information 'we' and they are aware of, like giving up hope in an impossible situation due to X when we just found out that one of them can control X.The film also introduces a lot of plot elements that seem like they will be integral to the story, but end up going nowhere. Not to mention the needless amount of fluff that comes with inserting a child into a bunch of anti-hero's.Ultimately, there was a lot of potential here. The idea of space-junkers cleaning up space debris was new and interesting, but it was all quickly forgotten about in favour of attempting family friendly adventure, that looses track of what it wants to be.",Space Sweepers

However, every time the movie pulls you in and creates a beautiful sci-fi moment - so you want to keep watching - the very next second they ruin it by some unrealistic moment, or childish act, or over-the-top origin story.This movie lucks dialogue, story and acting. The bad guy is bad just because he is bad, not a single nuance to the character.And given that there is plenty of gore in the movie, why the ending feels so cheesy?",Space Sweepers

Guardians of the Galaxy had not even half of the fun, soul and character chemistry as this movie did even with the help of employing a talking raccoon. I am more than happy to see Asian and Korean space representation. I am more than happy that Asian cinema is branching out and taking on traditionally Western dominated genres like sci-fi and this movie goes to show how on-par with Hollywood (if not leaps and bound better) Eastern cinema is. Even though the movie plays on some overplayed stereotypes, the characters were still a genuine joy, the effects are amazing and the plot holds up.

The multitude of languages is neat, but the English dialogue is delivered by the various foreigners with all the gusto of a middle-school English class reading. That's somewhat fair, because that dialogue probably came out of a middle school English class.The mother of all grievances, though, was when a character bit into a ""tomato"", but the sound effect was the quintessential ""biting-into-an-apple"" sound. I almost stopped the movie then and there.In total, this is a lazy mess. It's clear they spent the bulk of the budget on Richard Armitage and CGI.

Music :didn't get me thrilled on some 'supposed to thrilling' scenes
Tear squeezing scenes : quite annoying to see these scenes. Is it something that must be in Korean movies?
Story : felt like it was just finishing up quickly. Start was good and interesting though. The later,I'm not sure what it was really.

I dont understand who let this get published as it is. If they just spent a fraction of all the money and time on piecing the story properly, it could have been a great movie. The plot cuts and trips as the timeline progresses, you have to pretty much guess half of the story as you go. Many key scenes and explanations are missing. I would say that a Tom & Jerry cartoon has a more comprehensive story flow than this. Was exhausting to watch and it really is a shame. Whoever edited this, should be shot.",Space Sweepers

Is entirely worth the watch and the time spent with it. The narritive was refreshing and gave every character motive, means and reasoning for their actions and feelings. Begining was soild, middle was painful and the ending alittle lack luster in certain parts but the emotional pay off was amazing.Given the setting of the film you freely buy every aspect of it from the different languages and peoples in space. The economy, class system and characters, a sort of ""Ready player one"" mix match of faces in the supporting case that gave the world building a soild foundation. Decent messaging to the over all story nothing really ground breaking and there are some aspects of the story I personally would have liked to see explored alittle more.I'll leave it with this, as someone who loved firefly this film feels like a spiritual nod of respect to what Joss Whedon accomplished with a small budget and a killer cast. The only reason I didn't rate this higher then 8 was due to some jarring cuts in fight scenes and the villain being alittle 2d",Space Sweepers

I especially loved how they included a filipino in the movie. There aren't that many movies that have people from the same culture as me. The cgi during the action scenes was also very riveting!

317,vuongminhphuc,Entertaining and fun,7,11 February 2021,"An entertaining and fun story about a space sweeper, who lost his daughter and prestige after a series of events, and his team suddenly found a potentially deadly but adorable robot child in their ship, and now they had to babysit it until they find the next buyer. The plot was fast paced at the beginning as the movie try to dump all its expositions on you, until it slows down a bit for the real story to settle in, and it really kicks off at the climax of the story.Other than the main character, there was not much depth to any of the other characters in the story. We have the explicitly badass female character, the hard-on-the-outside-but-soft-on-the-inside gangster, a robot sidekick, and the innocent deus-ex-machina kid. We also have the poorly developed villain, which I feel the need to specifically talk about him.The villain of the story was pretty much a straight-up 90s cartoon villain. His backstory (if you could call a few sentences of dialogue with barely any visual depiction a proper backstory) was tragic, yet ultimately left little to no impressions on the viewers as the emotions behind it was drowned out by other elements that are happening during the scene. I felt this was a missed opportunity to make the character more nuanced and have evil motivations more understandable. He also apparently had a superpower as well, but the movie did not even bother to explain or even mention what is up with that.However, all the flaws in terms of character development in the story could be somewhat overlooked thanks to the special effect, which was good enough to enjoy.This movie works well if you're only looking forward to being entertained and having fun. In this regard, the movie was a blast to watch. I was thoroughly enjoying all the wholesome scenes that the crew had with the kid. The action sequences were strong enough to give you the thrills. Overall, this movie was not bad for me.",Space Sweepers

At times it felt like Monster's Inc. and others it felt like Star Wars. There was also some random slapstick thrown in that felt really out of place. The movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy, action, or drama.My biggest complaint is that this movie is filled with too many bull**** moments, like when a character should die, but they don't by some miracle. It's everywhere, and it's annoying.Another issue I had with the movie was that the antagonist had no depth, and was only made to be the person we hate.

It touches on important emotions, with humbleness and subtly.

The pacing was completely off, to the point where I question the director's experience. It's a crying shame that a high budget movie like this - yes, $21M is high in Korea - wasted its potential.

334,shadowcage,This movie is rated a 6.6 its a LOT better than that.,9,19 June 2021,"I love sci fi and this is one of the best sci fi movies ive seen in a really long time. Its got a good plot, the acting is decent and the music and special effects are on point. Even the villain is somebody you love to hate. All in all if youre a sci fi fan check this out. This was a LOT better than i was expecting. The trailer didnt do this movie justice.I never write reviews for movies but i wanted to for this one because its ones of those movies you might give a pass. So hopefully at least one person sees this and gives it a shot its a very enjoyable film. The little girl in it is so cute too and shes a great actor as well as the entire cast. Great movie I hope they make a sequel.",Space Sweepers
335,me-2893,Finally a Space Movie about People,10,8 February 2021,It's amazing to see a blockbuster movie written about interesting people with complex emotional arcs. So happy there are adults left in Korea who know how to engage an audience. I haven't been this entertained by a space movie since Galaxy Quest. Such a very human story. I want more!!!,Space Sweepers

337,eidolonmd-35-890170,An Exhilarating and Refreshing Spacecapade,9,8 February 2021,"I just finished this Netflix movie and OMO! Wow. What a game changer for K cinema. As a long-time sci-fi fan, this is now easily in my top 10 films of all time in that genre. I love the reimagined Wizard of Oz allegory, dynamic plot, production quality, talented international cast, and richness of the elaborate multicultural world and full-bodied characters - amalgams of collective dystopian civilizations and all my favorite elements of some of the best sci-fi movies that have crossed our paths through the decades - 'Blade Runner', 'Serenity', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'The Fifth Element', 'Total Recall', and many others. A handful of awkward lines as well as scenes with lukewarm tertiary character acting or mildly disjointed transitions do detract a few decimal points from a perfectly seamless viewing experience, but the magnitude and refreshing exhilaration of the entire film still overpower those and make it a must-see. The killjoys over at Rotten Tomatoes seriously need to have more fun in their lives.",Space Sweepers

340,cheeseman-drake,Brilliant space adventure,10,6 February 2021,It's first time reviewing something but I just had to say how good the film was! Lots of action but also a unique and feel good story. The special effects were great and as was the acting!,Space Sweepers
341,walley-drew,Top Tier Scifi From Korea,10,8 February 2021,"Though Korean, the movie is dubbed in english. Even the dubbing was well beyond most movies with good voice acting and script conversion to english. For the budget it holds its own against enormous budgeted Hollywood movies. I thought the acting, charecters and story were well done and feel it should get a much higher rating by movie critics. Average viewers did seem to rate it a bit higher. Even if scifi is my favorite and I am probably a bit bias I still think its worth a viewing. This movie is one of my new favorites. The creators of this movie (all involved) did a fantastik job and deserve a lot of credit.",Space Sweepers

343,mayonaiselover1,All round pretty good!,6,8 February 2021,"It certainly doesn't bring anything new to the Sci-fi genre but what it does do is very good. With amazing visuals and excellent sets it's no exaggeration to say its very easy on the eye. The story is a combination of plots we've seen before but you can almost forgive it for that as it stays fun throughout. I think the main actors do a good job for the most part but some of the supporting actors didn't feel very genuine.
There was one or two scenes that felt unnecessary and shaving 20 minutes or so off would not harm the pace of this film.
I think it is a bit too cheesy for my liking but it's saved by some fantastic action scenes.
I'm happy I watched the film and look forward to seeing what else South Korea has to offer.",Space Sweepers
344,Charoleia,An enjoyable space-flick for the whole family,8,5 February 2021,"Let's address the elephant in the airlock, the biggest flaw of Space Sweepers would be the plot which is highly predictable, because its tropes have been seen over and over and over again : the space cowboy who wants to redeem himself, the crew of misfits who distrust each other will become BFF through hardships, the multibillionaire who claims he wants to save Earth is actually evil, and so on.
But let's be real. I don't think expecting anything groundbreaking from a family friendly, blockbuster space opera movie is realistic. I guess it aims also to entertain people not familiar with the genre (even though Star Wars is highly mainstream, it must also be said that it's the first SF blockbuster on the South-Korean market).It's also a bit of a shame Richard Armitage was so underutilized. His character doesn't have a lot going for himself besides the 'I'm-so-evil' behaviour. His throwaway line of exposition to explain his motivations only helped cement the underutilization and poor writing for his character, making him feel at that moment like a poor, spoof version of Thorin Oakenshield.Fans of K Drama might feel like Song Joong-ki approach to his character was a bit too close to how he portrayed Captain Yoo in Descendants of the Sun, but it is still highly enjoyable to see him bring a goofy side to Tae-ho. Kim Tae-ri's Captain Jang would have also gained to be more developed - her background is barely explored at all and some aspects of her character felt like things were cut from the final product (maybe because the film is already more than two hours long).For those who enjoy sci-fi in general, you will probably like the shameless references to other movies of the genre : Star Wars, Elysium, the Fifth Element, Guardians of the Galaxy... (and though it is not space opera, one can't deny that the shots of the buildings and skyscrapers towering in the yellowish, dust-filled air of the Earth isn't a tribute to Blade Runner 2049 cinematography). Several things also reminded me a lot of BioWare's video games Mass Effect (the real time translators, the Sentinels, Sullivan) and Knights of the Old Republic (Bubs).The CGI is really impressive, much better than I expected considering the budget. Some might deplore the fact that the big CGI action takes place mostly at the beginning and end of the movie, but I thought it was welcome, as it gave more room to the characters to interact and grow and the plot to unfold - even if on a very expected trajectory. If the character development was predictable, at least there was some.The movie has plenty of amusing moments (though one in particular is overly childish and almost made me cringe, the laughter of the crew felt so genuine that eventually, I could not help laughing too) and emotional ones (might be tear jerking to some but I still liked that the hero had a bit more depth than his roguish, deadpan-snarker side).All in all, if you accept the premise that the story does not intend to reinvent the space wheel, you'll have a very good time.",Space Sweepers
345,touchstone-04518,Great sci-fi adventure - Very underrated,10,31 July 2021,"A well done space adventure with a heart that is way better than I originally expected.

Richard Armitage is very almost the best part is this movie.It's fun if you intend to talk through the entire movie with friends and mock the hell out of it (bonus points every time you say a hackneyed line seconds before the character does), but that's about it.",Space Sweepers
