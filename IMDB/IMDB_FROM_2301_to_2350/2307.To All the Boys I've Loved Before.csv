0,SnoopyStyle,super duper cute,8,24 August 2018,"Lara Jean Song Covey is a shy Korean-American teen girl. She is obsessed with romance novels and has written five love letters to her various crushes over the years. She keeps them secret in her late mother's box. It's a secret until her younger sister Kitty mails them out to force her out of her box. Three of the letters go out to classmates Peter Kavinsky, Josh Sanderson, and Lucas James. Lucas is gay. Her long-time neighbor friend Josh has been dating her older sister Margot until Margot breaks up with him before leaving for college in Scotland. Peter is the jock boyfriend of Jen, Lara Jean's former best friend. Jen still holds a grudge against her for a spin-the-bottle kiss with Peter when they were much younger. After Jen dumps Peter, Peter has the idea to have a fake relationship with Lara Jean.This is super duper cute. It is squeaky clean teen rom-com aimed more towards the female audience. Despite that, there are little things that surprised me from this formula movie. The stolen letters routine is nothing new but it is so sincere and sweet that it feels fresh. I give full marks for the casting of Lana Condor. Besides not whitewashing, Lana has both the super cuteness needed as well as a shy every girl that fits this role. She looks like a teen and can transform along with the film. Peter is the big surprise of the movie. I expected the love triangle to go a different way so when Peter's lines started hitting, I was pleasantly surprised at really liking this character. If there are drawbacks, they are minor and understandable. This is a smaller production and I suspect that it was intended more as a tween TV movie. There are limitations to every aspects. For example, the kids go on a skiing trip but there are no skiing scenes. A bigger movie would have a funny physical section about her failing at skiing. Also the confrontation is low stakes but higher stakes would require something more mature. These are all understandable drawbacks. At its heart, this is a lovely, cute, and sweet take on the teen rom-com formula.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
1,Quinoa1984,a pleasant and subtle surprise!,7,23 August 2018,"Hey, sometimes I am in the room and my wife puts on a movie and I am just compelled to not leave due to laziness... But then it turns out to not be too bad a thing thats on! I ponder and will assume Netflix did this to whet any appetites of those having just seen Crazy Rich Asians (which Netflix originally bid on to produce) and wanting more Asian-led rom coms.More than that, it's shot with what look like (to get oddly technical) good prime lenses so that it doesnt have that sort of cheap look that TV or even other direct-to-Netflix movies have sometimes. I feel bad this didnt get a chance to be seen in theaters, but on the other hand this may get seen by a lot more people than if it were only in theaters a couple of weeks and then brushed to DVD.This doesnt mean it is without some of the conventions of the genre (I guess they try to get around the ""Gay Best Friend"" by not making him exactly a ""best"" one - also, a token, which we haven't seeb un a while I guess). It also has the most non-""ill kill you!""-reveal reveal in a long time. But the main characters have great chemistry and it doesn't feel forced for a moment - or, at the least, I like seeing these two figuring things out as young people sort of stumbling into romance.And Lana Condor having a star-making turn here aside (she's pretty, but her acting is subtle enough to make this premise not seem too ridiculous), there's a guy here, the other male lead who I forget his name now, who seems to be the high school clone (in voice especially) of Mark Ruffalo.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
2,ComedyFan2010,Acute teen movie,7,1 May 2019,"I don't get all the excitement about this movie, it was not as extremely special as I thought it would be. But it isn't bad at all. Really entertaining to watch. Just an average teen movie.
The idea is pretty fun, but this is one of those movies where one can predict the ending from the very start.
Yet the movie is still fun to watch because the characters are so nice. Peter was apparently supposed to be somebody others saw as a mean jock but not once in this movie did he act mean. He was nicer than any teenage boy struggling with his hormones has ever been. Noah Centineo was really great in this movie. He must be the heartthrob of the current generation. Good acting and a lot of charisma.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
3,phd_travel,Pleasant and pretty but not romantic enough,7,28 September 2018,"Not bad is the general feeling after watching this teen romance. Wasn't delighted throughout or want to see it again. One watch is fine. 
I didn't think there was enough of a palpable passion between Noah and Lana. They are cute together but the relationship didn't seem to develop romantically enough to lead to love.The story lacks laugh out loud moments. The sending out of the letters is moderately funny. But more laughs could have been written in.The unique aspect of their Asian background wasn't played up enough.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
4,siderite,For a romantic movie it is really great!,9,19 August 2018,"No, she is not a shy girl with spectacles that suddenly finds her true love to remove the spectacles and notice she is beautiful. No, he is not a mindless cruel jock with the only purpose in life to show girls what not to date. No, he is not the good friend who in the end gets the girl because that's who she really loved. The characters in this film feel real and act like real people. It is so painfully obvious that the movie is based on a book: few original scripts for romantic movies ever pay attention to the people in the story and care about making the story original and relatable at the same time.Bottom line: for a romantic movie it was great. I loved and understood the characters (all except the little sister who should have died in any kind universe), even the ""villains"". I loved that there were no real villains, only people with goals and hopes and desires. I liked the actors, the acting and the direction. The movie is based on the first book in a trilogy by Jenny Han. I am not sure the other books are as good or if the story even needs a continuation. I thought it was perfect the way it was. Is it a romantic young adult novel adaptation? Yes it is. Is it stupid and formulaic? Definitely not! To me it is one of few movies about love and romance that don't retell the same cardboard story with the same cardboard characters. It is an art to find the perfect spot between relatability and realism. I think this film found it.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
5,Hellmant,The reviews are definitely a little too kind to it!,7,11 September 2018,"'TO ALL THE BOYS I'VE LOVED BEFORE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A teen romcom about a high school girl who writes letters to all of the boys she thinks she's loved before, and the letters somehow end up in all their hands, which causes great stress and trouble for the teenager. The movie stars Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, Israel Broussard, Janel Parrish, Anna Cathcart and John Corbett. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I found it to be pretty routine and predictable, but it's at least mildly amusing for most of it's running length. It's not funny though, or emotionally involving at all. The reviews are definitely a little too kind to it, I'd say.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

7,briancham1994,Exactly what it appears,6,3 June 2020,"At first glance, this film appears to be a cheesy yet engaging romantic film for teens. It is exactly that.

8,Thanos_Alfie,Not good...,3,22 May 2020,"""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a teenage girl who has written some secret love letters to her big loves of her life but never send them. That is changed when her letters were sent to the recipients without her knowing anything about it.I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed by it but I have to admit that the only thing that I expected was to be an average movie and it was not. The direction which was made by Susan Johnson was good and to be honest it was the only good thing in this movie. Regarding the interpretations, I believe that the only interpretation that worth mentioning was John Corbett's who played as Dr. Covey, all the other interpretations of the cast were below average.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
9,matthewssilverhammer,"I hate saying, ""This movie just wasn't made for me"", but...",5,18 February 2019,"...This movie just wasn't made for me. I think I was supposed to be super invested in this character's plight, but I just found her charisma-less. She only goes between three emotions the whole movie: mildly upset, mildly content, and mildly mild.

10,marmar-69780,to all the boys ive loved before,5,14 February 2020,"So since romantic comedys films are my least favourite genre of all of them i wasnt so excited to see this,but i must say that this film isnt as bad as i thought it will be,still this movie has a lot of cliches and staff that are seen in a bunch of films before this one and in bigger picture it doesnt offer nothing new or at least to make me to appriecte this types of films more,but it had also some good staff,cast did a nice job and they had nice chemistry even if script was cheesy to core their performances were highlight of movie,this movie didnt win me over like it did to some people,but i can say that it wasnt total disaster and it can be watched with a right kind of people",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
11,lisafordeay,Better than The Kissing Booth,7,5 February 2021,To All The Boys I've Loved Before is a 2018 romantic teen comedy starring Lana Condor and Noah Centineo. It tells the story of a shy teen named Lara Jean who's being keeping love letters from her crushes since first grade. But when all her love letters are sent on purpose to her love interests she ends up liking one of them called Peter. So she pretends to go out with him but will their feelings be real?Overall I enjoyed this film. The story was easy to follow and I thought Lana and Noah had great chemistry. Film also has John Corbett as Lana's father,To All the Boys I've Loved Before
12,jadavix,A cut above the typical teen fare,8,6 September 2021,"I think a lot of people remember high school as a time of painfully strong emotions they were unable to express. Perhaps you appreciated a teacher who went the extra mile for you, but you didn't want to let them know lest you be branded uncool by your fellow students. Perhaps you secretly really disliked a popular student you also found yourself trying to impress because everyone else did, and it was so much easier to go with the flow. And, of course, there were the crushes. You know, those devastating attacks of vulnerability that made you feel as though the ground had been ripped out from under you.Some of us also experience our first love in those years.In ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"", there is a splendid metaphor for strong, unexpressed feelings in the central device of the character writing love letters to all her crushes, that she never intends to send. Of course, we always wonder what would happen, or have happened, if we expressed these hidden feelings. ""All the Boys"" also finds a way to explore what WOULD happen, not if we were brave enough, but if happen-stance took it out of our hands, when the protagonist's little sister mails the letters to all the crushes she'd addressed the unsent letters.Often teen flicks feature a character who behaves distractingly more like an adult than a teenager, and I can't help but wonder if they are the people the adult film-makers wished they were when they were teens, but of course were not. Another thing to like about ""All the Boys"" is that it finds a way to throw the character into an unlikely situation not due to some improbable action on their part, but due to circumstance beyond their control.It's great when you see a teen movie like this that is actually good. That isn't totally clichéd, soppy, or preposterous. I liked pretty much all the characters. I say check it out.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
13,dfranzen70,I was forced at metaphorical gunpoint to watch this movie,6,6 February 2019,"The kids who made me watch it probably had no idea that the title is a riff on the old Willie Nelson song, or who Willie Nelson is. Ok, but the movie? Not terrible. It is a chick flick! There are, like, zero guns or helicopters or explosions, which is a bummer. But the plot made some sense, and the acting is way better than I expected. I mean, some of these youngsters can really act. Probably could have used more dogs, though. I don't think there were any. Still, it's a comedy of errors and misunderstandings that's a cut above what you normally see in a live-action kiddie movie.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

15,GiraffeDoor,Well I'd watch it again rather than drink urine...,7,11 March 2021,"I was sort of expecting this to a celebration of free love but really it was a fairly typical she-likes-him-who-likes-her style teen dramedy that isn't exactly unfamiliar. Yes, there are the 5 boys but bare in mind that this movie only really deals with two of them.Not that this movie is isn't likeable...I sort of like the main girl; she's cute and fun and the little sister is sort of fun in small doses though they really do over-use the ""she's a kid yet she's sassy"" joke type.If this movie has one real flaw is the over-reliance on narration. It could have worked in smaller doses but renders so much of the visuals redundant to the point I struggle to take it seriously.Ultimately there isn't a huge amount of meaningful conflict; yes, she is dealing with her feelings and trying not to betray her sister but it all feels really theoretical and the plot resolves pretty easily. I suppose it's really just the really long first episode of a three-part TV series.There's this plot point in the third act that had me scratching my head. What was the big deal even if it was snapchat? There is less pressure for the protagonist to develop than the male lead which I felt was a missed opportunity but maybe they're saving that for the perfectly titled sequel.But I still watched in (three sittings) and there are a lot more annoying movies. This is sort of like salted rice: sates the appetite no problem but isn't that much of an experience.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
16,AnnaPagrati,Super cute!,10,19 September 2018,"I recommend this for every teen (or not) who has been in love and who fangirls easily (umm Noah duhhh)!! Great actors, plot, was not bored one second and had goosebumps THE WHOLE TIME!! Can't wait for the sequel.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
17,a_chinn,I was warned this was a gateway drug to Hallmark Channel films,6,17 September 2018,"Inconsequential, but highly likable teen rom-com about a girl who's private love letters are made public to all her crushes. She convinces her current crush that the letters doesn't mean a thing and then pretends to go out with an old crush to make her current crush jealous, while her old crush is going out with her to make a friends of her's jealous. It's an utterly predictable and familiar rom-com plot, but a major distinguishing factor in this version of this familiar story is that instead of a blond haired, blue eyed Alicia Silverstone-type of actress in the lead, there's a cute Asian girl in the lead. Being Asian myself, I love seeing Asian characters in non-stereotypical roles (Long Duk Dong from ""Sixteen Candles is pretty much every Asian character of the 80s and 90s), so seeing a person of color as the romanic lead and going after a non-Asian Jake Ryan type of character is downright novel! My other favorite recent Asian-stereotype busting role was Reggie on the Riverdale TV series, where we get to see an Asian character playing a jock bully, which is pretty much the polar opposite of the nerdy 80s Asian stereotype we primarily see on film and TV. But I digress. Even if this film had a 1980s Molly Ringwald in the lead, ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" would still have been a highly likable film. It's nothing brilliant, but a cute Asian lead added novelty value to an unpretentiously entertaining film.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
18,nancyldraper,A good story for a young adult audience,7,11 December 2018,"This is a really good story for a young adult audience. It has an interesting premise and an innocence that is rather rare in this sex drenched culture and I appreciated some of the shrewd cultural statements along the way. This movie is based on the YA book (by the same title) from the ""Lara Jean Covey"" series by author Jenny Han (who has a cameo in the scene at the dance). I hope they develop more of the series for the screen. Lana Condor, who plays LJ, is a young talent to watch. Despite an odd disconnect in the casting of the sisters (it was rather hard to overlook that it was highly improbable that they had the same Korean mother) I loved the bond that was written for the sisters and their dad. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Young Adult Romance}",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

I'm just saying , i'm a bit surprised by Netflix.The plot is genuine, as i said the comedy is fresh , quick and current , the screenplay looked really good and firmly built ,, not boring dull lines what so ever .The casting was good, Lana Condor is a talented young actress , i think she was in X-men two years ago , wasn't she ! anyway , she and the whole co-leads did a wonderful job.final thought, it's a good family summer movie, go watch it.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

21,kjproulx,A Harmless Rom-Com with More to Offer,7,4 September 2018,"When Netflix announced that they would be focussing on releasing much more new content to the world in 2018 in both film and television programming, I was both excited and worried. I'll also be a fan of giving more creators the opportunities to make the things they want, but with some degree of discipline obviously. Sadly, although Netflix has been knocking it out of the park in terms of their original series', I can't quite say that about their distribution of feature films. With the exception of a few great indie films, their attempt at releasing Oscar contenders or blockbusters has been quite the failure, at least in my eyes. Happily, after watching one of their most recent releases in To All the Boys I've Loved Before, I can confidently say that this film slips into their small catalogue of solid original films. If you're a fan of the Rom-Com genre, then here's why I think you might enjoy this one.Lara Jean has her life turned upside down when her older sister leaves for college and that same sister's ex-boyfriend (who she used to love and also happens to be their neighbour) is now free. On top of that, the plot truly sets itself in motion when past love letters that she had written to multiple guys, leak out to them. After one of the boys realizes that she had been crushing on him in the past, they form a pact to make everyone believe they're dating, to get back at their ex's. This quickly evolves into something more to both of them and the movie takes a turn for the better. This may seem like a cheesy premise on paper, but it's held together very well by likable performances all around.Lana Condor (X-Men: Apocalypse, Patriots Day) is easily the standout here as the core character and she truly performs as though she may have had similar experiences in real life. I found her to be extremely likable in this role and the way she plays off actor Noah Centineo (SPF-18, The Fosters) was easily the highlight of the movie as a whole. If their chemistry didn't work, then this movie would've been a complete disaster, since 80 percent of the film revolves around their relationship together. This was all made possible by the direction by Susan Johnson.Not to say that Johnson deserves an Academy Award for her work on this film, but I must admit that I didn't find issues within any of performances across the board. That may be due to the casting by Tiffany Man and Tamara-Lee Notcutt, but I believe that a performance is only as good as its director and I believe her work has shined through in this project, as it did for the core performance of Bel Powley in her (feature film) directorial debut with Carrie Pilby. This isn't the case for every indie film, but I truly believe that performances should come first in terms of what the director focusses on. If you have a small budget and audiences will need to be drawn towards the performances of everyone more than anything, then I believe that's always the top priority for a film like this one.To All the Boys I've Loved Before is quite formulaic in its storytelling and you'll probably be able to see where it's going most of the time, but I found myself wrapped up in these characters and was rooting for the inevitable story beats to occur. For that reason alone, I believe this particular movie deserves a pass for being predictable and even a little cheesy at times. This isn't going to go down as one of the best films of 2018 by any means, but I do believe it's worth a look if you've enjoyed movies such as this one in the past. To All the Boys I've Loved Before is an innocent Rom-Com that may be worth your time.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

I did not think the actors were great or anything nor the outcome of the story which was predictable until the level of boredom. 
Lana Condor was fine enough and I had not issue with her but the rest of the cast was just either wooden or annoying. Especially Anna Cathcart.

The casting wasn't great - the older sister was almost 30 and was supposed to be 18ish, and a lot of the 'high schoolers' seemed more like upper-lever college students. Also, for young people, these were some prudish teens. No nudity, no sex, no real dating, no drugs, very little drinking, etc.With that said, even though they try to downplay Lana Condor's looks, she is still totally hot in this film. The current IMDB rating of 7.3 is rather ridiculous, but this is a very watchable movie. Great for date night or down time.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

30,dommercaldi,A Below Average Rom-Com That Was Over-Hyped,4,22 June 2020,"Pros:
1. The bright colour palette not only makes the film more visually appealing, but it also solidifies the suitably light and bouncy tone.
2. Both Lana Condor (Lara Jean) and Noah Centineo (Peter) have really good chemistry with each other.
3. The soundtrack helps to give a smooth, but upbeat feel to the movie without becoming overbearing.
4. The ending, whilst predictably cheesy, appropriately ends the film on an uplifting romantic note.Cons:
1. The sound design is a little off at certain points. For example, during the airport scene near the beginning of the film, the sound comes across as if the scene was filled in a cave.
2. The movie is far too slow-paced. Some scenes are either pointlessly inserted, whilst others are stretched on for way too long.
3. Israel Broussard (Josh) delivers a rather lacklustre performance.
4. A lot of the characters are either strange or unlikable. For example, Josh is whiny and unlikable, whilst Dr. Covey (John Corbett) is strange as he acts as more of a friend than a father to his kids, as he has nothing else to do.
5. The comedy is really forced and unfunny.
6. Andrew Bachelor's (Greg) cameo-role is utterly pointless and quite distracting.
7. Most of the conflict is ham-fisted and sloppily written into the story with very little set-up.
8. The plot is supposedly about Lara Jean and Peter making their respective crushes, Josh and Gen (Emilija Baranac), jealous, yet very little attention is given to that, and is instead focused on the relationship between Lara Jean and Peter.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

34,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Cast was solid, script was weak.",6,3 September 2018,"My main issue with this film was the script. Like they set up that Josh was Laura Jean's best friend before he started her sister and how she quickly became the third wheel. And with her sister now going off to college and the awkwardness around Josh she says ""Who am I gonna have lunch with now"". And yet suddenly out of nowhere in the next scene when shes confronted by the mean girl of the movie (Gen), she introduces ""Chris"" her best friend (who is also apparently the cousin of the mean girl). Like, if this girl is your best friend then why were you so concerned with who you were going to be eating with? And why were you third-wheeling all the time if you had another friend? I have no clue what the book is like, but it just felt like they randomly added a character last minute. I also have no idea why they added in that they were cousins. Its not like we ever saw them interact a part from that one scene. Its not like Chris uses intel on Gen to help Lara Jean or anything. Its just a random fact that does nothing to help the storyline out. I also dont get the irrational hate that Josh has towards Peter. I would get it if its a jealously thing. Like, if he was secretly in love with Lara Jean this whole time too. And he only dated her sister because he didnt think she liked him in that way, but no. That never comes to fruition, he still very much loves the sister. And he trashes Peter for being ""a dick"" and yet we never see anything that really warrants that. Also, I get for drama sake that they needed Lara Jean and Peter to have this misunderstanding, but If Peter truly want to Gen's room to tell her that they are off and are never getting back together than why not just say that from the beginning. How many times was he like ""Lets go inside and I'll explain""...like dude that makes you sound guilty. Also, theres this big point of the film where a video of Lara Jean and Peter making out in a hot tub gets leaked, and it ends up getting dropped. It never really gets resolved. There also is supposed to be this big confrontation scene between Lara Jean and Gen that was underwhelming. That being said, I didnt hate it. I liked the character of Lara Jean. I liked the strong family bond (particularly the sister moments). I liked the cast, and there were several cute moments. It was overall an easy lighthearted watch. Just dont go in expecting some masterpiece.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
35,Jared_Andrews,An Absolute Delight,7,26 August 2018,"Netflix has been scorching the rom-com game this summer. As other major movie studios have neglected this beloved genre, Netflix has capitalized on this underserved market by releasing a steady stream rom-coms just about every week. The latest, 'To All the Boys I've Loved Before,' is perhaps the best yet. Sometimes, I just want a movie that will make me smile. It's such a simple wish that often goes unfulfilled when watching movies. But not this time. During this movie, I couldn't stop smiling. I smiled so much that it made my mouth sore. Lara Jean (Lana Condor), a delightful 16-year-old who doesn't realize how delightful she is, lives her love life in fantasyland. She enjoys romantic novels and daydreaming about love, but she's afraid to pursue it in real life. She's forced to reckon with this when the five love letters she wrote to her crushes are mysteriously (but not really mysteriously because the culprit is obvious) mailed to each of them. One letter went to (gasp!) her sister's ex-boyfriend Josh (Israel Broussard), who Lara Jean has secretly crushed on for years. Another went to Peter, the ex-boyfriend of Lara Jean's nemesis. This guy who plays Peter, Noah Centineo, looks to be one of the breakout stars of 2018. He's ridiculously charming in a Mark Ruffalo kind of way. He will also star in the upcoming Netflix film, 'Sierra Burgess is a Loser,' so look for more big things from him in the future.After finding out that she likes (or at least used to like) him, Peter suggests he and Lara Jean enter into a fake relationship. It's perfect-he can make his ex-girlfriend jealous, and she can convince everyone that she isn't in love with Josh. The two of them make rules, ones that seem destined to be broken at just the right moment. Even in the earliest stages of the fake relationship, they have obvious chemistry, both as characters and actors. Condor is a bit flat in her performance, but Centineo effortlessly lifts her up, and lifts up everyone, really, each time he appears on screen. The story is decidedly 2018. The dialogue includes biting remarks like, ""you don't even post about me on Instagram anymore!"" Instagram comes up a lot. The litany of present-day references and apparent progressiveness of the overall film made me wonder why the writers made the Asian girl a terrible driver. Is it supposed be that self-aware type of joke that pokes fun at a silly stereotype? Maybe, but it didn't play that way.The only real complaint I have is the casting of Lara Jean's sister. The actress is 30 years old and looks old enough to be Lara Jean's mom. That opening scene becomes confusing very quickly when this 30-year-old woman kisses her teenage boyfriend, and we find out that we're supposed to believe she's 18. Fortunately, the sister leaves for college, and we can forget about how weird that moment was. 'To All the Boys' likely won't surprise viewers with any twists-it's not going for that. But, it remains charming throughout, even if it has its ebbs and flows. Once the story passes the effervescent 30-minute opening spurt, it goes somewhat flat. It's like a soda that's lost its fizz-it's still sweet and pleasant enough, but it's not quite the same. Though I must admit, I gobbled it all up, even the hokey message about putting yourself out there because you never know what might happen. Bottom line: the movie is delightful. I'm smiling now just thinking about it. Give it a watch. You'll be glad that you did.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

However, in my opinion, that doesn't make it good. The acting is good and the premise is interesting enough, but ultimately it fails to be very different from your typical teenage rom-com movie. This is definitely a variation of something you've seen before. And while the movie does contain messages about self-confidence and self-love, the ultimate lesson we learn is that a boyfriend fixes all of your problems.

Horrendous acting by really bad actors.John Corbett is fine but basically everyone of the young actors is just plain awful. It is like enunciatation and cadence do not exist in their vocabulary.THE DIALOGUE
The dialogue is just bad. These actors are not good but noone could make this garbage work. It is not authentic, it is not clever and it is not funny.THE STORY
It is fine even though it is nothing really new. The problem is so predictable.THE DIRECTING
As bland as the movie is, is the the cinematography and the editing. There is a lot of very weird framing of shots and I am pretty sure several times they break the 180 degree rule. They frame a lot by positing the camera centered which makes the movie even more boring. I didn't look up the director or the director of photography but if they already did a lot of stuff I would be shocked.I wanted to like this, the trailer looked promising but after about 30 minutes in I could't take it anymore.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

41,IamROCKAS,An actually good coming of age movie,10,21 June 2020,"This movie feels like a remake of an 80's coming of age movie (coincidentally, ""Sixteen Candles"" gets a shout out in this movie) for the modern age and I mean it in the best way possible. Lana Condor, who portrayed Lara Jean, is no Molly Ringwald or any of the characters she portrayed in the 80's, Lara Jean's background is more diverse and she deals with different problems on some degree but the emotional vibes hit on the same levels as the previously mentioned ""Sixteen Candles"" and movies like ""Dazed and Confused"", ""Juno"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". What ties all those movies? They made me smile without trying too much and sometimes that's all that I need. It's a simple desire that isn't always fulfilled, more than often I only get a sensation of smiling and feeling happy only for brief key moments in the movie. During this movie, and the previously mentioned ones, I just couldn't stop smiling for almost the entire movie. The movie keeps it's charm throughout it's run and everything feels on point, more or less.
I like to geek out about music and I surely had a lot to geek off about - from unexpected Bon Iver references to songs from artists like Wild Nothing and Blood Orange and even ""Everyone Want To Rule The World"" by Tears For Fears even tying emotional moments with the characters background, this movie had it all. The entire soundtrack this movie used is exceptionally good, I'll definitely have to add more than a few songs into my personal playlists, but the important thing is that music was used splendidly through out the whole movie - it never felt like it was out of place and it even added a lot to the current mood in the movie.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

44,richarddillomes,I need more Peter Kavinsky in my life,8,7 October 2019,"I came across this movie because every once in a while a Buzzfeed post about it will show up on my timeline and I thought, let me watch Crazy Rich Asians first then maybe I'll get back to you. Here I am on my rest day with nothing to do and I'm still trying to feel if I wanna continue watching This Is Us after the 2nd episode so I figured I have some time to kill and here we are with To All The Boys I've Loved Before.What happens when the love letters you wrote for five guys but never sent, somehow made their way to their intended recipients? Madness ensues and Lara Jean makes an efficient but messy deal where she pretends to like one boy in order to get over the other. Yeah, sounds like something we would do or in my case have done (Don't ask!) and it's okay because young love is supposed to be confusing and complicated like that. While the obvious target audience of this film are the Millenials, older generations can also relate as navigating through the complicated twists and turns of Love is a universal theme.Now I'm sure you've read about me ranting a little about how forced representation seems like nowadays in Hollywood, but you'll be happy to know that in this case it's a little different because the author of the book on which the movie is based on, Jenny Han actually fought off offer from studios who wanted to whitewash LJ and waited until the she found the right people that will keep the Korean-American character as she was. I'm sure it was a gamble on the producers' part (and clever to release it around the same time Crazy Rich Asians is making headlines), but after 'Love, Simon' and now this, it's like finally the world is saying to the younger generation that we got your back, inclusiveness is here and we're telling you stories from different backgrounds and perspectives. I mean really, The Joy Luck Club was released in 1993 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in 2000 so believe me when I say it's about damn time.So if you're in the mood for a light rom-com helmed in the John Hughes school of thought, then this is definitely worth the 99 minutes. Thumbs up to Lara Condor for carrying the movie, John Corbett who needs to be given more roles as a dad and breakout star Noah Centineo whose resemblance to Mark Ruffalo (even the way he talks) is uncanny (PSA, try to avoid the rabbit hole regarding Centineo or the character he plays Peter Kavinsky in social media, it goes on forever and you'll realize you've lost a whole day looking at his pics and gifs. You have been warned.) The middle credits gives us a peek into the possible sequel and given the success this subscription-based movie received (leave it to Netflix to make the straight-to-videos movies look cool), we should see books 2 and 3 soon which means more Peter Kavinsky for us, ergo all the wrongs in this world will be made right again.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
45,TheCasualReviewer,I smiled all the way through this one,8,18 February 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Lara Jean's (Lana Condor) sister sends out Lara's old love letters while at the same time Peter (Noah Centineo) is going through a break-up. In order to get the letter recipients off her back and in order to make his ex jealous, they decide to pretend to date.REVIEW:
This movie is just incredible at making you feel good. It reminds me of the song September by Earth, Wind and Fire. Every time that song comes on it does not matter what's going on, in that moment I am up dancing on a table like it's my last day on earth. That's this movie. I smiled all the way through. Lana Condor is great as Lara Jean, Noah Centineo is actually good in this film and Anna Cathcart as Lara's little sister Kitty, is just amazing. Other than what this film falls into as all other teenage Rom Coms fall into, I can't complain. The entire cast do a great job at the role they're given, the Directing is done well and the writing is lovely. Of course, we all knew how this film was going to end, but it doesn't make a difference to how I felt with the film. In most cases, when this happens I tend to hope the writing has a twist that tries to take me to an original finish, but I was genuinely hoping this film ended the way I completely anticipated. I can go over all of the little issues that a film like To All The Boys I've Loved Before typically have, but the positives trump these in a way that would make it unserviceable to even bring up.I can't say this film is for everyone, because this film is very heavily a teenage Rom Com and I can't say for certain this film would affect everyone like it does for a Rom Com lover like myself and others alike. However, this film is as good as it gets when it comes to a very heart-warming and lovely story that will tattoo a giant grin on your face from start to finish. 8.8/10.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

47,shannen-l-c,Light hearted and sweet,7,9 September 2018,"To All the Boys I've Loved before is everything you could want from a rom-com - a sweet and endearing love story between two likeable characters. It's uplifting and feel-good, and leaves you coming away with a smile on your face.The story itself is hardly original and very much feels like something from fanfiction (which it very well might be!), but it works and it's fun to watch. Peter (Noah Centineo) is the kind of young boy that everyone will fall for. He's handsome, charming, considerate and genuinely sweet. Lara-Jean (Lana Condor) is a likeable enough lead, if not sometimes incredibly naive. Representation is something that's becoming more and more important in new movies and television, so it was incredibly refreshing to see a POC as the main character of a movie such as this whereby there would usually be an exclusively white cast. Whilst I appreciated that the relationship between Lara-Jean and Peter was actually incredibly well-developed and natural for a movie of this sort, the movie still occasionally fell into the trap of using too many cliches. The main one that grated on me was the typical popular, pretty mean girl trope in the case of Peter's girlfriend, Gen, which is exhausted and boring. After watching the movie I attempted to read the book and could scarcely get through the first 5 pages, it was so terrible. It was as though it had been written by a 12 year old. There was no flow, the language was basic, the sentence structure dire and the characterisation non-existent. Lara-Jean is a naive and innocent character, but in the books she's insufferably so. After having read the book, I have even more respect for the movie than I did before. since it took material that was barely workable and produced a fantastic end result. Overall, To All the Boys I've Loved Before was an enjoyable viewing experience and anyone that's a fan of chick flicks or romantic movies should definitely give it a watch.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Its very hard to get everything right, and often films in this genre end up coming off pretentious, melodramatic or crude. To All the Boys I've Loved Before, has none of these things. Its cute, as realistic as these films go, funny at the right moments, unique, drama that isn't over-embellished and continues to be enthralling throughout. The acting, although a little inexperienced, is really top notch. Its not over-produced either, probably a lower budget for production, but it actually makes the film seem to have more heart and a sense of realism. The plot is well devised and thought out, casting was perfect.However the comedic style is quirky and as comedy is relative a warning for those people expecting an American Pie style sex-joke-comedy, this isn't it. Its really in good taste and lighthearted. It also could be slightly slow paced for some people who are used to the rolling mindless drama's of Hollywood. Recommend for families, teens and lovers of this genre.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
50,Sonofamoviegeek,Always read the book,5,4 September 2018,"Under ordinary circumstances, I wouldn't bother watching a teen flick like To All The Boys I've Loved Before. If you've seen one, you've seen almost all the others. I made an exception after hearing Jenny Han interviewed on the radio. The interview promoted the movie, of course, but Jenny Han was so impressive that I just had to see the movie adaptation of her book. At first, we were quite impressed. This is a teen movie that adults can enjoy. There's no horror or splatter, just almost real life situations. Then I read the book and disappointment with the movie set in. Either I stop reading books or I never again watch a book adaptation because I've had this experience too many times. Therefore, I've decided to set out my instructions for screen writers, directors, producers or anyone else trying to adapt a book for the movies:1) The book is the King James Version of the story. Don't add or subtract from the book. Another reviewer noted that Kitty's character is more likable in the book. The character development of each sister is equally important to the story. Chris is smarter than in the book and never asks Lara Jean's father when he decided to take up a career looking up women's vaginas. The book ends with Lara Jean taking the first steps to reconciliation with Peter, letting the reader use his/her imagination. The nice resolution to the hot tub incident doesn't happen in the book. Also, there's no video, just nasty gossip in the book. Lara Jean and Peter don't end up walking arm in arm on the lacrosse field off into the sunset. Movie goers can think and there's nothing wrong with leaving an author's original ending intact.2) If an actor will only take a part on the basis that the part will be expanded to fit the size of their ego, don't hire that fool. Lara Jean's father has a much smaller but more supportive role in the book. He doesn't hand Lara Jean a package of rubber before the ski trip. After the ski trip, he reacts to the gossip as would any good father by having a talk as to whether the rumours are true and advising that Lara Jean is too young to begin having sex. All actors should use the example of Jeremy Irons who reads and studies a book as part of his acting method.3) If the author is available to make the movie, make full use of their expertise. Jenny Han is listed as an ""executive producer"". Based on the radio interview, apparently her contribution was limited to ensure that the kitchen scenes included a rice cooker and that Lara Jean removed her shoes while on her bed. An author usually has better writing skills than the average screen writer and should be intimately involved in all aspects of developing the script.My first impulse was to rate To All The Boys I've Loved Before a nine. After reading the book, I can only rate this movie a five for a very annoying book adaptation.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
51,Scarefish,A pleasant surprise.,7,17 August 2018,"I'm not going to lie, there were a lot of red flags going in to this, given the massive amount of dull and terrible Netflix films that have come out this year, many of which focused on relationships and slice-of-life type stuff, but I think I kind of like this one. It's certainly the least obnoxious of the bunch, and is even more surprisingly carried by the young female supporting actress. There's nothing this film does that's extraordinary, but it's an easily watchable film that's fine through and through, and manages to avoid dragging despite having such a simple premise and it doesn't overstay its welcome. The leads in the film aren't amazing, but they're certainly above average, and are relatively charming. The film is quite heavily reliant on exposition, and feels oddly reminiscent of 13 Reasons Why, though I would say this is a much more tasteful story that handles it's premise appropriately whereas 13 Reasons Why felt melodramatic and edgy. The melodrama here manages to be less melodramatic, and the material is light-hearted enough to deal with a pinch of superficial acting.The dramatic elements are certainly nothing new, such as dealing with the loss of a parent, but they're implemented in a reasonable manner and are played out naturally and they add a bit of spice to what might have been an otherwise bland story with flat characters. It's refreshing nowadays to see characters with tragic backstories being portrayed in an empowering way. These elements are almost understated, and as a result the characters seem stronger than the usual. Towards the end there's a bit of an incident, but it doesn't cause tonal whiplash, and it's certainly not frustrating as it tends to be in other stories.I'm not a huge fan of teen films, especially not in modern times with how the music industry has degraded into simple, easy-to-produce tripe whilst brainwashing the simple-minded teenagers into thinking they love superfluous and downright useless music, and there's certainly an abundance of that in this film. It's a shame because the score feels fine for the most part, and the film opts for no music when a scene works better without it. I'm fine with simple and fluffy tunes to accent the films various moments, but the commercial trash is hard to deal with, even in small doses.This film's a bit of a pleasant surprise, and is among the few 2018 Netflix films I would recommend so far. For those who dislike 13 Reasons Why for being edgy or tasteless, this film will likely be more up your alley, and it's much less of a time investment as well.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Ok... there are a few parts that are a little predictable but I found myself not being able to guess what was going to happen throughout. Even towards the end... I wasn't sure which way it was going to go.There are a few shows out there(I'm looking at you Euphoria) that make me thankful that my teenage years were from 1998-2004. With all the societal and cultural changes that have happened over the last 16 years, that's even more the case. The enemy ex-girlfriend though... please tell me those mean girls still don't exist! There's something about those first-love feelings though. While I wouldn't ever want to go back to my young relationships, you can't help but remember those feelings.

Let me start off by saying that I thought the direction of the film was fine, nothing great. This is a lot more than I can say for the acting, which was, there I say, below average, especially from the lead actress; there was one exception though, and that (at least. for me) was the actress who played the little sister.I'm not sure that there's much that I can say for the writing, as it was adapted from a book that I hardly ever got into. I will say this though, most of the dialogue (between the girl and the love-interest)was, in my honest opinion, was incredibly dull and sappy.I will admit that this film clearly wasn't made for me. However, I've seen many other YA films (better written and far better acted) that I actually found myself to enjoy.

So bad that I honestly checked the director's name to see who could have butchered a movie this much. The adaptation was just as bad to begin with that maybe things didn't even come to the point of possibly being the director's fault. Casting worked for almost none of the characters except for the male lead (Peter) and maybe for Lara Jean's father- which were mostly wasted by the awful adaptation and directing in the end. The side characters weren't even characters! Lara Jean's best friend was only blonde hair with a purplish streak to me. Absolutely nothing was there to make you care about or like the side characters...The sound was weird, was it voice-over? It was a cringe to listen to Lara Jean talk somehow. The dialogue was extremely bland and felt as if it was pirated from an originally more meaningful and coherent text.The story wasn't anything new but if other stuff were handled better, it could have been a nice, classic high school rom-com.

They may have been developed as advanced marketing tools by Subway based on the aggressive product placement.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

With the main character being awkward and shy as well as a book worm I was able to relate with her really well and thought that she was the kind of character a lot of girls can relate to.

65,cinemawithcj,To All The Boys I've Loved Before - Cinema with CJ Review,8,1 December 2018,"To All The Boys I've Loved Before doesn't do much original in way of story, but makes up for it for what else goes into the construction of a damn fine rom-com.It's a truth universally acknowledged that Netflix movies are the most hit and miss productions ever (Look out for a future Cinema with CJ feature about that) so it's always nice to get a taste of something refreshing.To All The Boys I've Loved Before is just so charming and bright it manages to step ahead of most recent high school movie fare. Is it the simplicity of actually having diversity of a lead for once with some more Asian-American representation? Is it an adapted screenplay of a YA book written by a female, adapted by a female, and then directed by a female? Is it the inventive and wonderfully visual storytelling that does so well in showing and not telling? To All The Boys I've Loved Before is a lot of things, and that makes it good. Really good.It's not great, unfortunately, and while it both references and clearly channels the influence of the great John Hughes, this film doesn't reach that highly. But goddamn was I invested in the characters and the drama. It still had that genuine high school feel to it. You buy into the conflicts and the situations and the chemistry. It's written how people talk and more importantly it's written how people feel. Teenagers are stupid. And they are here! So when they learn, and when they change, you just can't help but smile. It's currently rocking Netflix, and it's currently rocking my evening.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
66,littlemankazoo,A MASSIVE let-down...,3,22 August 2018,"Pretty much let-down every tempered expectation I had for it, and ended up delving-into every realm of mediocrity, convention and 'Been-There-Done-That' imaginable.The direction is intriguing at times, and even a few motifs and shots in the film were unique and unexpected. However, everything else about this film is so FLAT. I understand this is a teen romance/drama, as well as the fact that it's a Netflix original film, but that really doesn't excuse the film from looking so visually boring.The concept this film brandishes, which was what initially enticed me into seeing it at the promise of a unique and interesting story of mysticism leading to an exploration of past loves and school romance, ends up utterly wasted in the long run. Beyond the first twenty minutes or so, we are then treated to a VERY run-of-the-mill, VERY cliched story of a popular boy dating the popular girl for jealousy and teen drama and all of that wonderfully gooey jazz that we have seen played-out in countless other teen shows and teen romance films. For such an interesting premise, it is an utter tragedy that the film completely forgets about this setup and opts for something so bland and uninteresting.Not to mention, it opts to shrug-aside this setup and simply focus on this uninteresting romance at the center of the film, and instead has the gall to tease more of this concept being explored in an after-credits scene that only serves to highlight even further how a good idea was forgotten about in the midst of this.Its portrayal of high school and how ""KIDS 'DESE DAYS"" talk and communicate is also woefully executed, especially when you consider this film is releasing hot off the tails of ""Eighth Grade"", a film that understands far better how teens of this current generation communicate and act. Ironically enough, that film was written and directed by a man and avoided most of the cliches and pitfalls that this film, written by Sofia Alvarez and directed by Susan Johnson, falls victim to. After seeing a film execute this far better only a month ago, seeing a film that falls victim to Degrassi-era cliches just stings, and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Something I CAN give credit for is that the lead performances, played by Lana Condor and Noah Centineo, are competently done and do help carry the film to at least be ""Watchable"". I think Lana certainly has the chops to be a leading actress for bigger and better things, which at least makes me happy to know there's something salvageable from this.But other than that...""To All The Boys I've Loved Before"" is simply a tired retread of cliches we've seen before, only with the enticing details of a new paint job and a tag promising something unique attached to it. In that sense, the film feels like a thrift store jacket.Promising to be something unique on the outside, but once it is well-worn, it slowly begins to fall apart over time.Hopefully that's a cool metaphor for all the hip, happening kids.

71,jaholl,Really Sweet Movie (Just Not convince It's Accurate),8,20 August 2018,"The gal who played the MC was ridiculously cute. She was probably the main reason I stuck with a ""kiddie"" movie. I'm a lot older now and it takes quite a bit to like (really young) YA books and films.The thing is, I don't remember 16 year old boys this way AT ALL. Even all the guys at our church constantly had over-flowing hormones. None of them were ever that serious or real.
Many of them got married young, just to get physical.
All us high school girls WISHED boys were this mature and could express their feelings like this movie portrayed, but c'mon...
They're not and except for the occasional kid, most 16 year old boys don't conduct themselves in the manner that this movie portrayed.
Boys fell for girls all the time, but the immaturity was a constant. In that age group, I can't recall one guy as sweet as Peter got, not to mention two of them.
Both Peter and Josh were well-spoken and conducted themselves as if they were much older than 16 year old kids.
Anytime a movie is made with kids in mind, I think all of the adults involved, like the producers and directors, don't take a true look back to their high school days.
This girls mother died when she was young, but Peter's father bailed and got himself a new family. Except for a couple of minor issues with abandonment, both of these kids were so well-adjusted for living in a one-parent home.
While it's not an impossibility that high school boys can be genuine and share their true thoughts and feelings, it's just really rare. 
Boys have their moments, but in reality, these movies aren't a true look into teens.
It's just another fantasy story.
Because I loved the actors in this and thought they were exceptional, I gave the movie a higher rating, even though it didn't feel like teens in real life.
I laughed because Peter continuously said ""Woe, woe, woe woe"" because he did this a bit too much and I was rolling my eyes, but the guy playing him (Noah Centineo) was great in the role.
Lana Condor is as cute as a bug in a rug. She's just adorable. Loved her and loved her acting.
This is a modern day Sixteen Candles, which by the way, is mentioned in the film. That movie is decades old, yet everyone still loves it.
I am normally a Sci fi girl, but when you've seen all the new movies, you gotta look elsewhere and this is what I chose.
Good job!

But it's cute. Sure, there are better movies - movies that make one think, movies that challenge, movies with tremendous character development or acting. This has none of those. To be sure, a lot of movies try so hard to be deep or powerful and they simply aren't. To spend 2 hours watching a miss of that magnitude is so much worse than watching a mindless, teenage romance that is innocent and simple and easy. Truth be told, I wish there were more movies like this - cute, sweet, fun, mindless - as even most romantic comedies are terrible with idiotic characters and extreme plot points that make everything unrelatable. On its own level, this movie works. I wish there were more like it.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
73,sdsande,A below average movie with below average performances and below average script,1,15 December 2020,"A really awful movie. Let me explain why ~ the 30 something actress playing the 18 year old sister, the perfect boyfriend being dumped for absolutely no reason, the ridiculously mean ''mean girl''(but sadly not hot and blonde and beautiful like the stereotypical mean girl), the sassy best friend, the perfect ''Calvin Kline model'' guy falling for the boring girl wit nothing to recommend her. But what really dragged this movie down into mediocrity was the main actresses rather insipid performance. I wish they had used an actress with better acting skills and more charisma, that might just have turned this movie around. She was less like a high school girl and more like a boring, middle aged mom. The other characters like the dad, older sister, mean girl, best friend weren't all that convincing in their roles either. There was allot of recitation of lines without any real acting or emotion. The script was generic and nothing really special. Noah Castelano is really a beautiful guy and so it made no sense for this cute, perfect guy to date the crazy, not so sexy mean girl or fall for the mom like girl. And honestly if guys like this existed in high school ~ beautiful, sweet, mature, selfless and supposedly a ''jock'' then high school would be heaven for every girl.
The most ridiculous part about this movie is the way these 15 year old children speak like mature, adults who have everything figured out. Come on, teenagers are the most irrational, immature, confused people on earth. They're selfish and don't have a clue. These kids have long conversations that make them sound like middle aged moms and dads. Noah as Peter was cute and charming but had a very ''cool dad '' vibe about him and not at all believable as a 16 year old high school kid.

75,austinfromdahood,"A unique teen movie with many flaws, but still good",7,19 August 2018,"Yesterday night I was watching a rom com with my 2 cousins. They really wanted to watch a newly released Netflix movie that was based on a book they liked. That movie was To All The Boys I've Loved Before. At first, I was hesitant, because I don't usually like rom coms and I don't like much movies that was based on a book. I decided to watch it with them, and this movie was actually a huge surprise. I expected a cliche high school rom com movie, but this movie is way more than that. Lana Condor plays Lara Jean Convey, a girl that depends on her older sister Margot quite often. She doesn't have much friends at school, and she's written a letter for every single boy she has liked, but she keeps them for herself. Then, these letters get out to the public in such a creative way, and then the conflict is made for the protagonist. I really think this movie is relatable on so many levels. Being an outsider, having a major crush on someone, and being involved in school drama. Lana Condor is probably one of the best actors in this movie, and her character goes through a lot in this movie, and I was mostly invested in her journey. Hr sisters in this movie are also hilarious, and they are a good trio. The people that play Lara Jean's crushes are also very good in this movie. The father in this movie is also a very important and he is the funniest character in this movie. The story is pretty investing and I cared for Lara Jean and her problems. This movie is far from perfect though. I thought Gen, a person that likes one of Lara Jean's crushes was a very cliche character and she didn't really need to be in this film. And they bring her up so much because one of Lara Jean's crushes used to date her and I felt like that whole subplot was unnecessary. Another part of the film that I did not like was a character named Josh. He is one of Lara Jean's crushes and although his acting was pretty good, he did not get enough screen time in my opinion. He is one of the most important characters because the story mostly revolves around him. He only got like 10 minutes of screentime at most and that isn't enough. There are also a bunch of continuity errors in this film that were so obvious it's not even funny and it really bugged me. The ending didn't feel very fulfilling in my opinion and it sets up a possible sequel to this movie, and I didn't like that. There is also a lot of obvious product placement that bugged me as well. If you're lonely one night on netflix and you want to watch a good teen movie, I think this movie is for you. 7/10",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Lana Condor is adorable, but I don't understand why the author would write about an Asian teen when she clearly isn't interested in exploring that choice any further than inserting a Yakult reference. (Har har, it's an Asian, drink, get it?) I haven't read the book, but judging from the film, they could have swapped her out for a Caucasian girl and there literally would not be any difference.

Instead I found a gem.'To All the Boys I've Loved Before' is one of the few rom-coms to come out recently that actually focuses on character and relationship development. There is no gimmick B-plot, or wasting a ton of time on advancing a tangential storyline that distracts from the main couple.Instead, the movie smartly plays to its genre's strengths and focuses almost exclusively on fleshing out the relationship between Lara & Peter, so that when they link up at the end of the movie (as expected) you actually feel something. This moment is not just an empty kiss but rather culminates the organic character growth and relationship struggles you see throughout the film. This is in stark contrast to most modern rom-coms where the character development and relationships come secondary to a gimmicky plot, leaving you not knowing the characters or even caring about their hook up at the end.'To All the Boys' is a rom-com done right and major studios should take note.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

It's so nice to watch a film not full of anger and pain and ugliness, but rather love and learning. And it was accomplished without any nudity and without any vulgar language. I'm not a prude by any means, but I get sick of the same old diet of sensationalism and crudity that pretty much every contemporary film made in Hollywood considers a requirement. The premise is perfect: what young girl has not written a love letter to a crush that she never intended to send? The storyline tracks well. The only thing that went slightly astray is the scene that alludes to the fact that in high school,, not everyone is who they seem. That hints at a back story that would be really fun to explore--maybe in a sequel?
Lana Condor is perfect (albeit slightly typecast) as the quiet nerd. Noah Centineo's performance hints at acting depth that looks promising to develop further in future films. Anna Cathcart is adorable as the little sister who wants the best for her sibling. And it was nice to see Janel Parrish do a great job in a POSITIVE role (let's see her in more of those, okay, filmmakers?). Those were the stand out characters in my mind, but the supporting roles were well done also. This is the perfect family film--cute, entertaining, light, and one you would not be afraid to watch with your kids (or parents as the case may be).

99,dilippoddar-IN,Original and Grounded,6,27 August 2020,"With a story that is sort of believable and characters that are charming, this is definitely one of the nicer teen movies you can watch on Netflix. Lara Jean (Lana Candor) is naïve but honest in doing justice to her character that is stuck in a limbo of romantic feelings mostly around Josh (Israel Broussard) and Peter (Noah Centineo). The movie is much grounded and makes you want to know what happens next as the storyline progresses. It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a dull or boring moment in the entire runtime. Values of self-empowerment, honesty, and family spirit are brightly visible. Acting is incredible compared to other similar titles with similar plots.Some of the more investigative audience might figure out certain loose ends including Lara not doing much to figure out exactly how her secret letters were distributed to their recipients. Peter's character is somewhat of a casual carefree person while Lara is more of an introvert who minds her own business. Her falling for him seemed a little bit unnatural even if they were pretending. Opposites attract they say! Before the end, a meeting of Margot (Lara's elder sister) and Josh (who also happens to be Margot's ex-bf) was expected but not shown. In fact, some more minutes could have been devoted to help explain Josh's character.Nonetheless, owing to an edgy and funky plot and impressive performances, the film manages to make quite an impression.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

This movie could've been played out by people of any generation.
I didn't feel any growing pains or angst and I never once rooted for or connected to Lara Jean. I loved the fake relationship bit but there wasn't any deep character development. The conversations were shallow so much so I didn't really get why Lara Jean was such an outcast, why the two main characters fell in love with each other, why she entered into this pact to throw off one of the love interests who essentially remains on the side burner most of the movie.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

I thought the premise the movie was great: A teenage girls' secret (and intended to be private) letters are accidentally mailed to her five crushes!I was hoping for something more along the lines of The Edge of Seventeen or Easy A where the movie is well-written, funny, but has some depth and edge to it that captures the real angst of being a teen. This, however, is very light TV-movie style fare, like what you would find on ABC Family (or I think it's called FreeForm now). Anyway, if you like the FreeForm style, then I recommend this movie. It was a sweet story with an endearing heroine. I personally just found it a little saccharine and boring.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
114,thefox477,It Was Alright,6,18 August 2018,"I went into this movie with no expectations. Have not read the novel but was the premise is promising. I feel like this particular adaptation had all the things necessary to be a good film, but missed the mark. It was cute in a hollow, stereotypical kind of way, if that's something you're into. I love John Corbett but as the Dad he was empty and cliched. It is not realistic that as a single father and an MD would be home every night to cook dinner for his kids. He'd have hired someone to do that. Mona's (that's how I will always know her as) acting as Margot was forced and seemed in-genuine, where as Lara Candor, though her lines were cheesy at best, acted like she was her character. Though aspects of her personality were rather annoying, she did well as the lead. The actress who played Chris got a sucky script and did fine with the lines that she was given, but it seemed like someone was trying too hard to make her look hipster. Also some of the plot points didn't make sense. Why didn't the main character spend any time wondering how these letters got sent out? Why did Josh all the sudden seem like he was in love with the main character? Why would a dad just hand their kid condoms when she goes on an unsupervised ski trip? If she said she had 5 letters that she had written why did we only see three of the people? And why on earth would you not tell your best friend that you are fake dating someone? This is your best friend, come on. The two things that did work well in this film was 1) Kitty. She was charming and at times even hilarious. Her acting was natural. And 2) The two main characters had a legit chemistry and that wast the only reason I kept watching. All in all if you have nothing to do, sure, watch it.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Acting was sometimes irritating but not torturous. The movie was just too shallow. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters and their lives. No proper conversations. Just the one scene after they ate at peter's house and were talking about her dead mom and his dad while doing the dishes. That scene seemed like an interesting and different touch but it didn't last long.
Most of the scenes were predictable and cliche. A LOT of cringe moments I just couldn't stand.

(""Sixteen Candles"" actually gets a shout-out in the flick.)It takes some suspension of disbelief (some relaxation of the critical mindset that comes with age) but no more than others of its type. (""Lady Bird"" being the exception -- a teen angst movie that overlaid the Hughes blueprint with grit and realism.)The biggest obstacle is accepting the obviously older actors playing teens, especially the 30-something actress playing the 18-year-old sister. (Molly Ringwald was 16 when she played a 16-year-old.) If that doesn't bother you, then go for it.

But now that I am giving it a 5 I wonder if I am being generous.The plot is not bad and acting by the cast is good too, well except the female lead around whom the story revolves. Her acting is not good, not good at all. and since for almost 70% of the time camera is pointing on her face, it starts bothering you how limited she is in her facial expressions and over all acting. instead of leading the movie like a lead cast she was dragging it down. When I say limited facial expressions, I mean very limited, in fact just two. One is her social media smile, that I am pretty sure she use everywhere, cause it is good. But then comes the bad part. Her other expression is kind of a poker face which she uses for everything. and it gets frustrating after sometime when she keeps using that face whether she is I shock, confused, thinking, embarrassed, even angry.This gets bothersome even more when support cast is doing much better acting than the protagonist.

Again, I don't know since there is a book I haven't read. I heard there may be a sequel, and I'm glad because it felt like there should be more between Lara Jean and Gen.

I am disappointed in how much the book was cut out of the film. The amazing cooking, the sisters relationship growth, the Korean culture that's been left behind by their mom, the pressure of Lara Jean, and the tension between the boys and Lara Jean at the end. It was all very quick and subtle like the movie was trying to rush everything. I feel robbed the kiss scene with Josh following the eruption of emotions and tension between the four of them. It was done so poorly in the film. I honestly am upset that I couldn't like the film. I just can't. I can't feel anything while watching it. I love the book dearly and the characters, the story, but this adaptation wasn't the best. One thing I appreciate though, is that they stick to casting an Asian American actress for this role. I adore the cast so much and I can see them as those characters. I just hope that the movie was better.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

176,katiequeenoftennessee,Unfortunate,3,24 February 2021,"I am biased because I loved and read the books, but this movie fell short by so much. I tried to watch it again with a more reasonable amount of expectations, but I think it's just a bad movie. It hurts me to say it.I have far too much complaints. Why is color scheme of the movie like that? It's so blue. I know teenagers these days like filters and social media, and I probably would've liked the filter too if it wasn't so incredibly saturated. It made every scene seem more bleak than needed and underwhelming. What are these camera angles? In the bathroom scene where Lara Jean is with Lucas, the camera is zoomed in so close to his face, it's almost cut off. This movie is strangely paced. The relationship that builds between Lara Jean and Peter seems sudden. We never see any scenes where they truly bond and get to know each other, and then suddenly Peter is in love with her! The dialogue doesn't help either.I don't know why the lead actress has a constipated look on her face so often when attempting to convey emotion and why most of the actors deliver their lines so unrealistically and insincerely, putting way too much fake emotion and dreaminess into their voices. I would be more forgiving for the performance of this cast. They probably thought the movie would flop and didn't deserve much of their effort, and part of the cast admit to not even bothering to read the books. However, this cast repeats their performance throughout the other movies.While none of the characters live up to what I had hoped, I did not hate Margot, Josh, and Peter as much. The casting for Josh looked close enough to what I had imagined. I know people will hate me for this, but Noah Centineo as Peter was...fine. I've always found Peter to be a simple character, and all Noah Centineo had to do was play a cool, popular love interest. Peter is not a complex main character, like Lara Jean, so Lana Condor had a more daunting task. I don't know what else to say about Lana Condor's performance, except that I hate Lara Jean as a character even more now. I don't find her facial expressions charming, relatable, or funny like every else. I think they're fake and unfit for the situations Lara Jean is in.I am heartbroken that they butchered one of my favorite book series. In my opinion, this movie is terrible and something I WOULD wish on my worst enemy if I had one. However, I have to admit that it's only me and that Netflix and this cast succeeded. Teens love this movie, so Netflix must have done some research and successfully catered to their audience. I was part of the targeted audience when I first saw this movie, but I am on the older edge of Generation Z and have to admit that I grew up very differently from the younger, dominant part of Gen Z. I wish Gen Z would pick up a book so that they could experience some quality storytelling.I will say that the trailer is incredible and everything I dreamed up for this movie. I rewatch the trailers because they are so well edited and make these movies seem great. Additionally, the movie has a great soundtrack, which really aids the transitions between scenes and makes this movie watchable.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

It was fun and quirky and relateable for anyone who has ever had a crush on someone.

185,gothicsunshinebooks,It's a really cute movie...,9,7 May 2020,"I started watching this movie about two years ago and found it to be a cute movie.Lara Jean is a dreamer, who has never been in a relationship. Her main purpose in writing a love letter, is her way to say goodbye, to who ever she fell in love with. It is a form of self reflection. Lara Jean wrote herself the closure, only to find out her letters have been mailed out, and becomes stuck in a whirlwind of relationship drama.In this case, the most recent person she was saying goodbye to is her neighbor, Josh Sanderson. Josh dated her older sister, who is leaving for college over seas. They have spent so much time together. Especially while her sister was dating him, they didn't want her to be left out. She felt left out, so she wrote him a letter. Despite the whole ordeal and change, Lara Jean and Josh are still friends even after her sister broke up with him. One day Peter K talked to her about the letter, since then that when she kept having to avoid Josh.This resulted in a fake date with Peter K., both parties their reasons for fake dating each other. Lara Jean's reason, is so she could avoid Josh. Peter,'s reason is so he could make Genevieve jealous. This contract lasting for three months. During those three months, both Lara Jean and Peter K get to know each other, and the lines become blurred.What I love about the movie:

But sadly the lack lustre acting, uninspired script and non-existant characterisation made this unbearable to watch.The main character's Asian wardrobe showed more personality than the character herself. Besides the remarks from the other supporting characters about her being ""smart"" and ""shy"" there's nothing that reveals personality to the audience. And why did they pick 2 male leads who looked so similar?The storyline was so flat throughout the entire movie that watching the predictable unfolding of events was laborious.Instead of being a fun fizzy teen romantic comedy, this movie failed to deliver on both likeable characters and entertaining storyline.

Sad to say this but...glad Josh didn't get much screen time his performance was the weakest. Overall I had so much fun with this movie.

211,Ch_Kings,The perfect line between reality and fiction,9,10 October 2018,"Watching romantic comedies the last decade has been a mine field, and mostly because they either tend to be too political, too realistic (romantic tragedy) or so ""stereotypical fake"" that you turn it off halfway through. ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" manage to do what the above fail at, and finds the perfect line between reality and fiction. The way the dynamic between the popular and the less populare students in this movie is portrayed is so amazingly believable, and it paints a more realistic picture without being over dramatic or too real. You still have the essence of ""the jock"" falls in love with the ""nerd"", without it actually being blatantly obvious, and it's refreshing to see a movie where they nail that type of storyline with a more realistic highschool setting.The cast in this movie is really great, and the lead actress manage to pull off the balance between ""quirky teen"", charming and touching. Reminds me a bit of the acting of Hailee Steinfeld from ""The edge of Seventeen"". The little sister in this movie is great, funny and charming. The boys in this movie has depth, and fits the role. The only thing I would like to put my finger on is that the oldest sister seems like she could have played a young mother, and it actually threw me off a bit in the start. With that being said.

I even felt myself getting butterflies watching the characters relationship develop (maybe bc the main dude is prettt hot, and I'm allowed to say that because he's of age I googled it to make me feel not creepy :'D).

218,l-burns09,"Nice movie, but very overrated",6,7 September 2018,"I watched this movie when it came out on Netflix because I thought it had an interesting plot. I don't usually like Netflix original movies, with the exception of The Fundamentals of Care giving. This was a nice enough movie to watch if you're bored, but I think the hype surrounding it is a bit much.The love story is cute and all, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The plot was sort of entertaining, but predictable. I liked the first half of the movie, but i feel like it went downhill when it got to the ski trip. This was a big event in the movie and I feel like it was executed poorly. With the exception of the kissing scene in the hot tub, which was actually beautifully done. After that the movie loses its flow, with a weird story line in which Lara Jean claims she's in a sex tape. The ""sex tape"" she's referring to is a video of her and Peter kissing in the hot tub, which was sent to her anonymously. Therefore, I don't know if she's saying it's a sex tape for comedic effect or she's just being over dramatic. The movie ends nicely enough though and I don't hate myself for watching the whole thing.Again I don't understand the hype. The acting could have been better, especially from the lead actress Lana Condor.

221,amycakes1958,What Are We Teaching Young Girls?,3,22 August 2018,"Yet another film from a female perspective that is exclusively centered around romantic relationships. Even when the bland female lead with a Pinterest-looking bedroom isn't talking to/about some crush, she reads crappy romance novels. Because a young woman's life revolves around being rescued from the world by a man? She has no personality trait other than the fact that she's vaguely considered ""smart,"" and she dresses nice. 
At one point the male lead (the men are impossible to tell apart btw) asks her ""how have you never had a boyfriend?"" This girl is only 16! Why would she be expected to date? Is that her standard of worth? The love interests also lack personality. The only defining characteristic of the Peter character is that he really likes her. They don't ever talk about anything deep except for their interest in each other. 
I really don't understand all the positive reviews for this film. Maybe there was something in the original book that was worth while. If you're skeptical about seeing this film, do not listen to the positive reviews. If you're looking for an extremely shallow take on the world, then by all means, feast your eyes.

226,cuteastronauts,One of Netflix's best recently,6,30 September 2018,"So many things to love about this movie... I'm not saying it was perfect, but it was far better than some of the stuff Netflix has come up with recently honestly. To All the Boys I've Loved Before approaches a different kind of storytelling which was what made it enjoyable for me. It wasn't too stereotypical and I found it hard to predict what was going to happen next, which is nice to see in the age of cliches and overuses of devices that seemed to work once for keeping the audience engaged. The actors were great, although I don't think it needed much skill to play these characters. The cast were all well chosen, it really felt like their characters fit them. The narrative structure was great, because as I said, it left no space for me to be able to predict what happens next. It had good twists that both kept me interested (which is hard with a long film like this; I struggle to sit through 20 minute episodes of something I like... So that says something.) and really wowed me because I really didn't expect anything to be so complicated. Although I don't understand what the title really has to do with what actually happens in the film... Because of it, I thought it would be a film about a girl who has her love letters (I knew it from the trailer) sent out to her past crushes and then we would learn what she actually wrote in them, and would have to deal with them somehow. I really imagined a different way for how things would go. I didn't expect it to be about a fake relationship. But even that bit was done well because I couldn't predict what happened next. I had an idea, knowing the typical structure of most narratives, but then in the film, everything turned out different to how I thought it would. Lara Jean is a really lovable character, I think Lana Condor really contributed to that. It's kind of cliche, how she starts dating the jock, but really, I think this storyline is approached with interesting techniques. I love the cinematography too. There's this interesting filter applied on it and I think it really suits the whole film. It creates a quite sweet atmosphere, it's as if I was put into the same fantasy world Lara Jean lives in. I noticed that around the edges of the screen (camera), it was kind of blurry and it reminded me of wearing glasses. It feels like we, as the audience, are wearing some kind of glasses that Lara Jean is too. I wouldn't call it rose coloured glasses, because there is reality in it, with LJ's mum's passing away and the fact that there are many complications in her and Peter's real relationship, however, it does show the naivety of teen love. It gives me sort of a warm feeling inside, one that crushes, for example, could give me. I really love how teen love was shown with this. Overall, it's quite a good film, but it's not something that wowed me and I would recommend to others. It's quite average, there's nothing really ground breaking about it. It's interesting, how things were done, but I still don't think it's really special. It's creative, but not something that will leave a mark in the film industry.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

239,ninasladonja,An Ok Teen Romantic Movie,6,3 March 2021,"Is it a bad movie? No
Is it great? Not either
If you like heartwarming teen romcoms you will probably enjoy this movie, but it is by no means revolutionary, a masterpiece or extremely enjoyable or touching.
Good sides of this movie:
1. The costume design is pretty impressive, I loved all the outfits.
2. The interior design, colors and cameras are gorgeous. I loved all the bright colors, nice furniture and good quality of the cameras.
3. The acting was good. In these kinds of movies there's almost always one really bad actor that ruins the movie. In this movie actually all the actors were good if not even great.
4. It's realistic. Sometimes writers of romcoms make them totally exaggerated and unrealistic because they fear a realistic story would be way too boring. This I could actually see happening in real life and it is not very boring so I would say the writers did a good job on this.
Bad sides of thsi movie:
1. Characters are boring. They don't have their own personalities, I bet you couldn't think of 3 Lara Jean's characteristics. They had a great opportunity to make an interesting character trying to find their romantic interest whilst dealing with grief but totally missed this opportunity.
2. Nothing really happens in this movie it is an empty plot. I can't think of 2 memorable, scenes, gestures or quotes. It is all just so blend, normal and boring. While the writers did a good job with keeping it real they totally failed on making it fun and unique.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
240,hfdznnn,I am waiting for the sequel of this movie!,10,13 May 2019,"To All the Boys I've Loved Before Movie Review
Do you love to watch teen romantic comedy movies? I recommend a movie based on YA novel by Jenny Han which the best-selling novel and inspired by her own experience. For true and to be real, I've never read the novel, but just see how much I love this movie! It's kind of a rom-com movie that Netflix had released and got so much attention. The way this movie serves its plots is simple yet interesting at all. This movie is telling you about how the shy girl named Lara Jean who had only one friend loved some boys in her past time. She is the middle child of three children in her house. She has two sisters, The older one named Margot and the little one named Kitty.
This movie tells on a girl named Lara who wrote a letter when she has a crush and loves someone that she doesn't know what to do because she is a shy girl. She kept the letters for herself and put it in A box. There are some reasons why she doesn't send the letters, It's about friendship and her sisterhood life. From these reasons you know how hard for Lara to show people except their family, how she adores them. The conflict starts when Kitty, her little sister takes the box and sends all of the letters to the address mentioned in the letters. Each boy gets their letter and so does Peter Kavinsky. He is handsome, Popular, and rich and also Lara's friend when they were kid.
Lara and Peter make a deal that they will date each other to reach their own goal. Unfortunately, this fake relationship makes them feel true love. They fell in love with each other and start their real dating, but the conflicts appear again. Both of them, Lana Condor and Noah Centineo are great actor and actress, their soul in this movie shows at the best moment at every scene. Lara and Noah are the sweetest couples in this movie! You may love this movie so much and watch this movie many times without getting bored. Their acting is so real and incredibly pure and sweet, I love every part of this movie and every person involve except Lara's nemesis that is Peter's ex, Jen.
This movie has a short duration, but you can feel a long-lasting feeling and start to smile when you are thinking of it. But there is a part that you will only realize after watching this movie for times. The part is when the students go on a skiing trip, but there are no skiing scenes, even though I wonder how romantic Lara and Peter in skiing section when Lara for the first time tried hers. Overall, I really love to watch this and it is still the teen rom-com I suggest you watch for cheer you up and happy. I am still waiting for the sequel to this movie hope it will be published soon.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

I picked this movie to watch with my friend because we were having the crappiest day and this looked to be the cheesiest film on Netflix. We expected to get our amusement from the cringes and the cheesiness. What we got instead is a teen movie that in many ways felt relatable. In the end, it was more romantic than comedic. However, that being said. The movie left me with a warm feeling and a memorable story. If you're watching it as a RomCom, then I assume you don't expect to be wowed. You don't expect to see anything new. You're watching it for the journey. I would sign up for this journey again.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

I thought it was a fantastic movie to watch and fell in love with the characters immediately. It wasn't stupid in that a character did something unforgivable but was forgiven anyway, or major flaws were easily overlooked. No shaming of fat, race, gender etc that we see still in movies, like Insatiable and others like it. 100% recommend to everyone to watch for a cute teenage romance that doesn't contain major plot holes",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Especially Peter Kavinisky's character, played by Noah Centineo. He perfectly embodied the personality that the author Jenny Han gave Peter on the book. I read To All the Boys I've Loved Before a long time ago and it's incredible how well they stick to the source material. You never know what you're going to get with movie adaptions of books so I was catious to not get my hopes up. Even though I was hesitant to enjoy the movie, it quickly won me over. The ending, although short and sweet, allowed a perfect gateway into a second movie.

269,preparedforterries,No Surprises No Disappointments,5,9 October 2018,"For most viewers this movie should deliver what they are expecting. 
For better or worse it is a pretty standard teen relationship movie. The dialog isn't the sharpest and the acting isn't the best but in general the cast was pretty likable. Also, I haven't read the books but it was really nice to see some diversity in a lead role. My one major complaint is with the casting. Lana Condor who plays the lead character is charming and I have no problem with her carrying a movie. However, it was a bit strange to see her play a mixed race character. 
Her character's father is Caucasian, her mother is Asian, and both her sisters are mixed race but Lana is clearly not. For some people this might not seem like a big deal, but I found it distracting. 
Also, I realize this is pretty common, but the older sister seems way too old. Her character is supposed to have just finished high school and entered her first year of University but the actress that plays her looks closer to thirty than twenty. 
Little details like this don't ruin a movie but they take away from the realism.Ultimately, I think it was a decent but forgettable addition to the pantheon of teenage rom-coms. Similar movies that I enjoyed a little bit more:The First Time

I do have to say though that when Josh was all jealous of Peter he was acting exactly as I imagined in the books!!

I had just read the novel for 4 hours straight and finished it 20 minutes before the movie premieres on Netflix. Watching it, I was upset that they didn't show the family dynamic more like how the girls had an unspoken pack to make their dads life easier and how Lara Jean was ALWAYS baking. Now that I've rewatched the movie multiple times it just gets better. It's a acually a really good movie, I think my opinion was tainted due to me just having read the novel and expecting more. Some things I wished they would of included to draw out more emotion and attachment to the characters 1. Peter asking for her to go to the football game and party while she's making cupcakes but decides to put on an apron and help (swoon) 2. JOSH JOSH JOSH ! They changed the plot about him kissing her . It was so important as she told Peter in class and he became stiff and upset. ( it was a sign he liked her ) 3, Xmas baking . COME ON ! It would have showed this warm cozy scene and led to one of the funniest notes from Peter about making fruitcake cookies instead of Joshe's cookie.

283,niranjandevadiga,All hell's gonna break loose on me for this review,6,23 August 2018,"But I don't care. Because I won't lie that I loved the film. But I'm not saying that I 'hate' the film.
I would start by saying that ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"", directed by Susan Johnson is a colourful film (I'm talking about the color palette of every frame). Based on the book with the same name, by Jenny Han(I haven't read it), this is about Lara Jean Song Covey, a reserved girl of sixteen, with a Korean descent (not relevant), who lives an unknowingly painful life. Her mind houses the world of her fantasies, and her fears.
So that was pep talk, now's the real deal.
What I like about this movie, is that it provides depth to the Covey-Kavinsky relationship by empathizing both of them.
Peter Kavinsky is the stereotypical cool guy, but apart from the stereotype, we see that he is a loving human. We can't take that away from him. 
Their 'fake' relationship flourishes into love in the course of the film.
But that transition doesn't turn out to be happy. How?
I'm talking about the unsung hero of the movie. Josh Sanderson, after breaking up with Lara Jean's elder sister Margot, looks up to Lara Jean to fill that empty space in his heart, provided that he received her love letter (which talked a lot about her desire). But it was not happening. However, he transforms from a whining dick to a caring friend. However, what we see is that being understanding to Lara Jean, Josh couldn't comprehend his tragedy. The loss. And he wouldn't comprehend it even if he could. And that's sad.
However, what's more sad (the part about hell breaking loose on me) is what I don't like about this movie. This is a coming-of-age drama with coming-of-age clichés. And the most painful cliche is the fact that - the protagonist is an introvert who lives in her own world and who has an unique approach (in this case, 'unsent' letters) to her love life.
There are many more, like inserting a couple, kissing around the characters which make the scene(s) extremely boring.
Secondly, the screenplay, written by Sofia Alvarez. The dialogues are well-written but they don't 'feel' natural, only sound to be natural (at some instances, not even that).
And that is bad for a movie which tries to interconnect life(reality) and fantasy in such a convincing manner.
Now I have to ditch some valuable points, such as discussing about the single, over-loving father of the three Covey sisters (he is a doctor), their deceased mother (we feel her absence) and of course, the three Covey sisters (they love each other).
So that's the movie for you.
I would give it only 6 stars out of 10.
And now you know why all hell's gonna break loose on me, but once again, I don't care.

285,moljamartinovic,BADD!!!!,1,27 August 2018,They keep calling her with her full name Lara Jean it is really dumb and off-putting while watching the movie i hated it. But even if we regard that the plot is just so cliche and predictable its not even worth watching. People who liked it are probably 12 year old girls who dont know better. Conversations were so unrealistic and boring the whole vibe of the movie is weird and the main character is one dimensional and annoying the whole plot could have been avoided or solved if she were just using her brain ughhhh!!!!,To All the Boys I've Loved Before

In the book, there is a whole section where Peter and Lara go to pick up antique chairs. I thought it was an important part of the book because Peter is teaching Lara to come out of her shell more. They also left out the recital party that more near the end of the book. The party was where Margo finds out about everything, and Josh finally confronts Peter. It is a huge turning point in the book, so I was shocked when it was left out of the movie. I also think that they didn't depict Peter's character well enough. He was more sweet and caring in the movie than he was in the book. However, I was hooked on the movie from the very beginning. Even though there was some things left out, some things were spot on.

300,iskandarclarissa,A somewhat realistic perspective with unrealistic privilege,7,4 November 2019,"I love this story where there's a somewhat realistic dialogue about high school love interest that doesn't feel so exaggerated.
However, it does not break the existing stereotype that makes Asians a ""model minority"" to Caucasian cliques. In my experience, there was a constant pressure for Asian girls to be more ""Americanized"". Those who weren't as well-fitted to the Caucasian cliques, end up being set aside as they search for other individuals that are accepting of Asians. Racial structure in social cliques is not as simple as what this movie makes it out to be. The main character in this movie represents another Asian girl fantasy of over praising a white guy and access to car/ other unrealistic privileges - almost scream as Asians need their white savior to come out of their shell.
I'd love to see more people of colors in this story like our American high school is a rich culture full of persons of colors.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
301,hannaamin-42262,A heartwarming movie with a lot to learn,9,22 January 2020,"Netflix continues to show the world their visions to turn New York Times best sellers into their own Netflix Originals, as they did with Jenny Han's To All The Boys I've Loved Before. This high school romcom between Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) is bittersweet and can be loved for every audience.Lara Jean is in the middle of two sisters, who she holds a tight bond with, her younger sister Kitty (Anna Cathcart) and her older sister Margot (Janel Parrish). This is a Korean American family where they live with a widowed American father (John Corbett) of a Korean mother. In high school Lara Jean is the girl who sits around on Saturday nights with her younger sister joking about not having a boyfriend because she's ""too nerdy"", but Kitty changes that for her all in one night.The suspense of the title of the movie To All The Boys I've Loved Before comes from Lara Jean writing love letters to 5 of her crushes over the years and addressing them, but never sending them. With these letters being so precious to Lara Jean, Kitty gives herself the courage to do it for her sister. These are boys such as: ""Kenny from camp, Peter from seventh grade, Lucas from homecoming, John Ambrose from Model UN, and Josh."" She states that she writes these letters when she has a crush so intense she does not know what to do. Her latest letter was to Josh, her older sisters boyfriend (later ex), which becomes her most secretive crush that could ruin her relationship with her sister.Lara Jean and Peter relationship begins when he receives his letter and he confronts her in the middle gym class wondering why she is still drooling over a middle school kiss in high school. Lara Jean spots the letter in his hand and faints, but once she recovers she sees Josh running over to her with his letter she immediately kisses Peter, then running away from him. Later, Peter confronts Lara Jean about how he just got broken up with and Lara Jean confesses that she is trying to get over her sisters ex boyfriend. They use these feelings to their advantage to come up with a plan to create a ""fake relationship"". They create this pawn scheme to help them create jealousy from their past loved ones. They organize a document of the things they things they will commit to do with each as boyfriend as girlfriend.The journey of the fake relationship between these two is irresistible to watch because of the genuine relationship and emotional connections between the characters. The director Susan Johnson did an incredible job of giving that emotion because it gives the film more sense of sincerity. Although the relationship is fake the audience can see both characters slowly fall in love with each other by the little things they do for each other. This is what makes the movie so heartwarming. Watching young high school couples falling in love without even noticing it. Kavinsky is the heartthrob of the year and is the guy every father wants for their daughter. His small movements from the way he looks at Lara Jean to when he puts his hand in her back pocket. Noah Centino does an excellent job at keeping the connection with Lana Candor and that's what's going to want people to come back for the second movie, P.S I Still Love You coming to Netflix in February.To All The Boys I've Loved Before can been seen as a cheesy teen romance movie, but also can be viewed as a movie where we can relate to the disappointments and anxieties we have going into relationships. The modernization of romance in this movie speaks volumes about how teenage relationships are handled today. This movie truly emphasizes the fact that with our walls that we have up, we should be able to trust ourselves.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
302,ajajude,"To All The Boys I've Loved Before, giving unexpected lessons on broken families and the love within.",9,22 January 2020,"I have always had a love for reading novels, more specifically teen romance novels.
Reading To All The Boys I Loved Before by Jenny Han was a fluffy and heart-warming experience, and the movie did not disappoint bringing this story to life and making it cheesier than ever.
This Netflix original takes Jenny Han's novel under the direction of Susan Johnson, and tells the story of Lara Jean. Lara Jean (Lana Condor) is a junior in high school who has never had a boyfriend, but she has loved five boys in her past to whom she wrote letters. The reason why she puts a name and address on these letters is questionable, especially when they are never supposed to be read. One day these five letters get sent out, and it is pretty dramatic, especially when one of the letters is delivered to her older sister's recent ex-boyfriend. It's pretty cringeworthy, to say the least.
One of the recipients of these love letters is the oh-so-charming Peter Kavinsky, who is played by Noah Centineo (... I mean come on). His girlfriend of four years has recently broken up with him, and he wants to get her back. At the same time, Lara Jean is wanting to convince her sisters ex-boyfriend Josh (Israel Broussard) that she does not have current feelings for him. They decide that under these circumstances it would be of-interest to fake a relationship.
To those readers who can't help but compare the book to the film, when it comes to the outline of events between Peter and Lara Jean, it is pretty spot on. There are a few specific incidents that occur at different times between the text and the film, but Susan Johnson presents the story in a way that almost moves at a better tempo than the book does. The beginning of the movie is what differentiates itself from the novel the most, the first scene in the film being unnecessary and confusing in my opinion. It shows Lara Jean's imagination of love through a book she is reading, but in a really weird and unmodernized way. Although I'm not a fan of the scene, it fulfills its purpose of showing us Lara Jean's personality and her perception of what a relationship would look like. We come to find out that her mother passed away as a child, explaining her lack of knowledge in this area. Growing up in a home without love, until her sister Margo (Janel Parrish) started dating Josh.
The romance part of this movie is not the only thing that makes viewers emotional. With an absent mother and a widowed husband, Margo does her best to raise her younger sisters. Janel Parrish contrasts her most famous role with this movie, as she is most recognized for her work in Freeform's series Pretty Little Liars, where she is known as the town's creepy anonymous abuser. Susan Johnson does a better job emphasizing Margo's huge role in her family in the film than the book did, and when she leaves for college it might make you shed a tear. As the older sister in a family that has a missing biological parent, I know the responsibilities of Margo and I have an appreciation for her character. Janel does an excellent job in connecting to this role and leaves the audience inspired by her drive and passion.
As the film develops, it's evident that Lara Jean and Peter are unfolding more than fake feelings for eachother. Peter's gestures put teenage girls into a swoon, suddenly raising the bar for boys in our generation... Which I wouldn't say is a bad thing. Both characters have a missing parent at home, one from abandonment and the other from mortality. Screenwriter, Sofia Alvarez, does an excellent job at incorporating the rough emotional reality of having an absent parent. Along with the writing, Condor and Centineo fantastically connect to their roles. You almost forget that they have their own lives outside of this story.
Although this film is cheesier than ever and sometimes so mushy it makes you want to barf, it truly is an excellent film. Author Jenny Ham incorporates a lot of hard things that teenagers have to deal with within the plot, and shows how such things can deeply affect a person's vulnerability to love. Susan Johnson brings the written emotions to life and makes her audience feel all of the feels. In this heart-warming blast of love, there's a beauty and a relatable truth for everyone, making it much more memorable than you would expect.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
303,miamx-59082,The book was better,7,12 August 2020,"While I did enjoy it and it was a cute movie, I don't really understand why it got AS popular as it did. The book was just so much better! I know that you can't include everything in an adaptation, but my main problem was with the watering down of Lara Jean's character. One of the reasons I fell in love with the book was because it was one of the only YAs where the main character isn't a strong badass (not that I have a problem with strong female leads), and she was very emotional and cried a lot, which is something I relate to a lot. The movie didn't portray that at all, although at least they kept in her shy awkwardness.I suppose it is more of a personal thing, because it really is a sweet and heartwarming movie, but compared to the book it just fell a bit flat for me. It also may have something to do with the fact I don't find Noah Centineo attractive AT ALL, and he is nothing like how I imagined Peter Kavinsky in my head, but everyone else is head over heels for him so maybe that is swaying their/my bias.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Then i directly watched this movie. Clothes of role was so elegant and movie's atmosphere, the cast, was really good.
I think that movie gave encourage to some people. because most of girls can't express to crash ""which is love to someone'.
So Lara jean's sister help to his love life. If may be his sister didn't help to him, He couldn't meet Peter.
If you want to watch genre romance and drama, i suggest this movie.

311,so_rad_i_am,Very enjoyable and light romantic comedy,9,18 August 2018,"I rarely review movies on here, but this was too cute not to. Just for reference I am a woman in my late 20's and I still enjoyed this movie very much. It might not have been the most original story line and the pacing might have been a little too fast, but overall I think it accomplished what it intended. First off the movie is very short, only an hour and half or so. Some of the character relationships aren't as fleshed out as they could have been, for example, Lara Jean's friend Chris and Josh, Margot's boyfriend. Besides that, the main character is extremely endearing and quirky. As an Asian American, it was nice to have character representation in a light teenage love story. I recognized a lot of my awkwardness in Lara Jean and it was nice to see an Asian heroine. The actor playing Peter was fantastic and I totally developed a little crush during the course of the movie. He has a Milo Ventimiglia/Mark Ruffalo thing going with the voice and facial expressions. Full disclosure, I read a little of the book a while back, but I think YA fiction doesn't have as much effect on me as I get older. The movie on the other hand brought up a lot of feelings of being a teenager and the fluttery butterflies that come with falling in the love for the first time. Overall, the movie just made me feel good. It was cute and easy and fun. In fact, I watched it the night it came out, then again the next day while I was cleaning and hanging around. The only movie that I can watch back to back is Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightly. What can I say, I'm a sap for those butterflies. Also some of the dialogue was low key hilarious, especially surrounding the dad's profession and moon cycles.

The dad character is completely plain, the pride of the Asian heritage doesn't come through in the movie at all and Lara Jean is a character who seems so plain in the movie even though she isn't in the books. Same for Margot, who is played by an awesome actress, but the script just doesn't work for her and Josh's role in the movie is completely faded away which makes the motives in the movie even more vague.

I then learned it was based on a book. I decided to read the books first before watching the movie. I'm glad I read the books first, they were much more entertaining than this movie.This movie was a complete and utter disappointment. Every moment of the movie felt rushed and forced and therefore had no depth of character. Jumping through the timeline so quickly. It even took some things out of order from the books, which is fine, but when you make it seem like it's no big deal, and just all of a sudden move on from it (I.E. the Hot tub incident) with no real consequences. something like that doesn't just go away in a few minutes and certainly not as easily as they made it go away in the movie.I saw there is going to be a sequel so I hope they learn from their mistakes in this one.

I've been hearing a lot from friends, who are all in the same boat, watching this movie over and over again, because that's how good it is. Lara Jean is just an invisible girl, until her secret love letters get sent out, and then what's a girl to do? I like to think that we were all dreamers once, if not of a love that we would eventually come to us, or if it was a dream of the perfect career. So this movie can be relatable for anyone who has ever had a dream.

I can't give this movie 10, because of course there are so many cult rom-coms that it can't be compart to. I tought this is on more poorly made Netflix movies, but it totally shocked me.

334,davidmarkparker,I really like it but....,8,26 August 2018,I love it them film but just couldn't get over why the main part was asian but none of her sisters where. I thought maybe she's adopted but it hasn't been brought up. Then you see the pic of the mum and she looks like her but the other sisters are obviously Caucasian. Why wouldn't they get the two sisters to be asian actress as well???,To All the Boys I've Loved Before
335,nina-oliveira99,Best movie based on a book,10,18 August 2018,"As a real fan from Jenny Han's books I have to say that this movie has all of the essence!Since the first minute you will fall in love with Lara Jean and her story. I'm so happy that even though some parts were taken away (as all adaptations), this one is perfect! Really! When I saw the movie I had the exact same feeling that I had when I first read the novel. The actors fit perfectly the book's descriptions and in Kitty's case, they even overcame it! I loved Lana Condor and Noah Centineo as a couples OMG. They had so much chemistry just like Peter K and Lara Jean. Not to mention Chris and Lara Jean's family. I felt inside the book again.This movie is lovely! I recommend it 100%!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

337,chelsea-atterbury,First review ever because this movie rocked so much,10,18 August 2018,"The writing- so good. The acting-so good. The story- so good. I have recently been very disenchanted with my shows and movies that have been coming out, but this one was something very special. It made me laugh and cry. It even made me have butterflies like I was back in high school again just because the romance was so endearing.

340,micaivkovic,Best in a while,10,10 September 2018,"When I first watched the trailer for this movie I was thinking that this is cliche teen movie. So I was sceptical. 
It was absolutley stunning. I was blown away by the story. It is the most beautiful teen movie, it's not like others. This movie NEED sequel!! I can't wait to re-watch it a million times. Best rom-com in a while. 
If you haven't whatch it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? JUST GO WATCH IT. G O!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
341,alfrierson,9/10,9,10 January 2019,"I read the books when they first came out and LOVED them. I was nervous when I saw that Netflix got the rights to the movie because Netflix originals are either super great or terrible. Needless to say, I went in with low expectations.I was surprising pleased with the movie. The casting is AMAZING! The plot sticks to the storyline of the novel pretty well. Jenny Han even makes a surprise appearance!One thing I was a little disappointed about is how the audience cannot truly grasp how complex Genevieve and Peter's relationship is. There is so much between them because of their pasts, and the movie hints at it but does not fully explain it. I do not think that a person who simply watches this movie without reading the series can fully appreciate the characters and their relationships. It is so much more than a story about a girl who wrote some letters.Overall I really loved the movie and am excited to see what they do with the second!!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
342,haydentessa,SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,19 August 2018,It's my new favorite movie!!!!! It was dramatic and had me in anticipation every step of the way! I loved how the movie really gets you involved in the characters lives and toys with your emotions.,To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Really teenager movie as expected, but, it doesn't have something that makes it be like ""Wow"", it's that washed up teenager romance formula of any other movie",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
345,cynthy_cynthia,It is a really good movie,10,30 August 2018,"Jenny Han is an exquisite autor with a good sense of humor. The movie adaptation is not as great as the book but it's quite enjoyable. There are some details that don't match and it's kind of annoying and they shouldn't have changed Kitty's personality. I'm giving it a 10/10 because I can'y see anything majorly wrong with it. I recommand it! You won't regret watching it, even though it's not life changing.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

347,rbayne-19919,Cringey teen movie with some aesthetic,2,25 December 2018,"While the cinematography is nice the characters are boring, stereotypical, and the story seemed a lot less meh in the book.

348,nadhilapn,"Great cinematography, acting, and plot!",9,24 August 2018,"Back in 2014 when Jenny Han released the book. I remember borrow it from a friend but didn't quite finish the book. Only the first three chapters I guess because it feels kinda boring to me soz. The movie is so amazing and beautifully created with these amazing casts and storyline without changing the plot. Yes they removed some characters. But the main characters are still there and killing it. And how am I gonna start telling you about how PK being potrayed in the movie?! Both Noah and Lana's chemistry as PK and LJ are undeniably cute!When the movie was released, I couldn't stop watching it at least once a day. And I'm currently reading the second book now. Looking forward to watch the sequel!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

351,isabelfischer,So adorable,10,2 September 2018,"I LOVED this movie, the best part of tatbilb is that peter is never an a*shole who needs a redemption arc. like he dates gen who's obviously problematic, n he makes that one kinda sketchy comment about how lara jean has better style than her, but it's all just like very normal teenage boy behavior that never veers into toxic or abusive. like, he drinks kombucha when he was to drive. he IMMEDIATELY addresses the ""s*x tape"" without hesitation or feeling weird about sticking up for his girlfriend. he never cheats. he never raises his voice at the girls he's dating. like I get that all of that is bare minimum behavior but so many romcoms glorify verbally or emotionally or even physically abusive relationships and it's refreshing to watch a teenage boy who's obviously flawed but not in a dangerous!or abusive!or evil!way, like it's so. nice. and I get to stan peter kavinsky unconditionally without having to be like ""WELL I KNOW HE'S HORRIBLE BUT-"" like no. he's just. an angel.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Thoroughly enjoyed the entire thing and would watch again. I really hope that they have a sequel.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
355,eseier,Unexpectedly cute,9,20 August 2018,"Saw the trailer on Netflix and thought ""Oh, this looks cute. Let's try it."" Glad I did. Def one of my new favorite rom-coms. The actors were great and the story was unique, which is refreshing for a rom-com. Hoping they make the rest of the books into movies as well with the same actors.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
356,scarsocc,I am surprised how much I loved it,10,25 August 2018,"My sister recommended it to me and I started it reluctantly. But, very soon into it, I fell in love with the characters. It made me super giddy watching the two main characters together and brought me back to when I was first dating my husband in high school. I didn't want it to end, I wanted to keep watching them interact together. Perfect casting and a really fun, makes you smile, movie. I will be recommending it to all of my friends!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
357,savannahwalckner,A fun and crazy story twisted into something lesser,6,17 August 2018,"I was surprised how different this movie was to the book. Because the book was great, and this was just meh. It felt like all the funny parts and heart racing parts was made into cringy and awkward scenes instead. Lara Jean, the girl who played her, was very cringy, to say the least. I felt like there had to been a better actress than her, especially if her siblings are better actors than her. Ya know? But Peter. Oh god, Peter. I loved him, which surprised me at first but he really was a perfect Peter. So let's move on to the other cringy actors.Whoever played Chris and Genevieve need to leave this movie and never come back. Chris is so unlike her character, and made to be ""edgy"" but she came off super annoying and hateable. And Genevieve, don't get me wrong I hated her in the book, but my god, the girl who played Genevieve sucked. She just didn't do her role right. To be the heinous mean girl she's supposed to be.And Josh, the idea of him was perfect, but he became whiny and not really there which pissed me off because he was a vital character in the book. I actually loved Josh when reading the book, and it was sad to not really see any of his personality or his inner struggles with LJ and Margot. But my most wondered question is this: Why would you change a perfectly written story with great scenes to this?",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

361,jonnyzerger,This is everything I wanted!!,9,23 August 2018,"I didn't read the book. 
I jumped on this film because some of my friends were raving about it and it was 11PM at night and I had Netflix open and what else are you gonna do on a Wednesday Night? Yeah, sure, work the next morning, but Yolo lol....Well....I was hooked 5 minutes into the film. 
Everything just kinda felt right. starting with the production and set design, which gave me the first glimpse of who the characters are, and then continued at the chemistry between the actors and the dynamic between the main character and her family - it just felt organic and lovely and just like good writing. And then I continued watching. And you know how it is....you're on your iPad and you're kinda watching the film in a small corner, while you're really browsing facebook or whatever....but this film DEMANDED my attention! I just HAD to stick with it! 
It was in the performances, in the characters, in the story, the way it was shot and in the film just making all the right choices, steering clear of stereotypes or classic tropes and understanding their characters. It was relatable, and funny and quirky and adorable and beautiful and everything I never knew I wanted, but desperately needed. I cannot applaud the cast and crew enough for the work they've done here and sincerely hope that we get to see more like this. Oh. And I thought the casting couldn't have been more perfect if it tried.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

The atmosphere of this movie has everything you'd expect in a rom com with added flavour with the experimental costume choices and the lovable characters, far from your average ones. The actual plot did not follow quite what I thought it would from the trailer but wow the ending is what we all wanted! What a refreshing movie.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

374,hjascroft,A worthy YA book to film adaptation,9,17 August 2018,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the book and it's characters, my expectations for the film were somewhat high - and met!The film is a light hearted and fun watch, not dissimilar to films like The DUFF and How to be Single. I was left feeling sentimental and warm, I'll be watching it again later today!The adaptation was true to the book and contained the key elements that made it such a fun read in the first place. Lara Jean is as fickle but entertaining as her character in the book, the same with other characters (Peter is just as cocky but charming). My only slight complaint is that we didn't get to see the best of Kitty, the craziest and wittiest character in the book at such a young age! She had some fantastic one liners in the books that still make me cackle. The ending of the film set it up well for the sequel - hopefully other fans enjoy it as much as I did and we get to see everyone reunite to tackle the next plot!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

376,grachelanneperdido,AMAZING!! I LOVED IT!!,10,17 August 2018,"I loved it! The movie was really good! There wasn't so much drama and I loved how they emphasized the part where lara jean and peter k talks about their parents and just get to know each other without being aware of it. It was a lowkey romance movie which is what I loved about it the most because it was warm and nice. 
I read the book but it would've been a 10 if they added the Halloween on November part scene where lara jean wears cho hang in harry potter and peter k becomes peter parker from spiderman. The chasing in the hallway stuff, giggling and especially the parts where peter writes notes to lara jean, and they should've added more scenes to the ski party where people are shown to be skiing AND I was also kind of expecting the ""almost reconciliation thing with Gen"" where Gen admits to Lara Jean that she's jealous of her. And it also would've been nice if they showed the stages of how peter was changing because of lara jean, shifting from a proud guy to someone who gives in because he's falling in love. I loved the movie but it would've been so much better if they added those scenes just so they could also focus on peter and lara jean's story/relationship, because thinking about it just gives me butterflies and we all know that feeling it while watching it is very important in making films.
But all in all, I would definitely recommend this to my friends and practically to everyone! I hope that they would also make movies for the sequel! And another thing to add, the cast is perfect!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

380,jewelyn_red,"Great modern representation, sweet story",9,17 August 2018,"A sweet romantic comedy with good Asian representation! Lara Jean is a realistic teenage character. I liked how she had a cute vintage fashion style (also the pastel restaurant with milkshakes and neon lights was a aesthetic setting.) It was relatable how she was overly careful about driving and wrote letters to savor the feelings of having a crush. The characters were all lovable, especially the little sister! The sisterhood felt true to life and was endearing. I watched this with my little brother and his ship ended up sailing and I conceded. It had a good ending.

387,andzelikaduleba,I loved it!,9,18 August 2018,"The plot draws you in, it's both cliche and original. And the character of Lara Jean is just so amiable and amusingly awkward, you want to watch the whole movie just to see her change - because you know there's going to be a big point to it all.It's between childish and mature, I'd say. It has that hint of innocence, thrown into a high school with jocks, playboys, queen b's. There's drama and humor, a lot of emotions. All combined, sending a message not to judge a book by it's cover etc., created a really good movie, just for you or for the whole family.I wasn't going to watch it at first but the title just stuck in my head. And I'm glad it did. It's a movie that you can watch again and again... And it's going to be long before you get bored of it. My opinion's my own so not everyone might like it as much as I do.

Additionally, I did not read the book so my review is based on the movie alone. I decided to watch this movie due to an ad on Instagram; 45 minutes in I had to skip forward to scenes because it was so boring (and I honestly didn't miss a thing...alert spoilers ahead!!) While the acting is fine, all the scenes are one big cliche. I don't understand how many of the reviews state that this is an original rom com? A shy awkward girl dating the hot jock so that he can get back at his ex girlfriend is not an original storyline people! The said non conforming couple temporarily breaking up because the popular ex girlfriend did.somethig mean? Wow, I am blown away by the novel idea! Also, I felt that unless you are a highschooler, it was very hard to identify with the story line; the plot was quite juvenile.A last thought; I am getting so tired of seeing movies with these priveldged teenagers (I.e., this movie, with love Simon, etc.). Maybe in LA that is the norm, but everywhere else in the real world a 16 year old shouldn't be driving a car that most can barely afford. (Insert eye roll) it white washes the characters and creates an unidentifiable and vanilla storyline.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

I could really relate to Lara Jean (nerdy girl, non-popular in HS, read a lot of romance novels and didn't have any BF's).

Honestly, I could barely keep my eyes open during the movie - uneventful and predictable from start to end. I must assume that is not my favorite type of movie, so I had the bias from the beginning, but I could not understand what makes this film that popular. There are dozens of much better movies on Netflix right now and I felt so frustrated that I am writing a negative review for the first time in my life.

409,simpleveracity,What is this movie trying to do?,3,27 August 2018,"The movie started out with a novel concept that I thought was going to be intriguing and worthwhile. It quickly played out to be a very mediocre and Hollywood story. Lara Jean jumps through so many hoops to avoid talking to the one person who would have understood her at the very beginning of the whole situation. She manages to fall for a stereotypical jock, who ""drastically"" changes for the better by simply ignoring an ex he has no more use for, and then she completely disregards the one guy who has genuinely cared for her since they were kids. Is this movie trying to normalize manipulation under the guise that they're still teens? I am concerned how well-received this movie is, especially so if anyone finds this relatable.The moral of this story seems to be that good guys don't deserve the spotlight. I felt for the protagonist at first, but lost interest when she failed to comprehend that the thing she wanted most had been waving at her from the sidelines the whole time; unfortunately, life doesn't reward those who take the higher ground, right?",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

However, this movie is almost too horrible for words. I thought this would be a cute movie and a harmless way to pass the time. First of all, the plot line is completely rediculous. All Lara Jean had to do was simply tell her sisters ex that she didn't love him anymore. she did NOT have to parade around with Peter. it was a transparent set up to them falling in love. The conflicts were stupid, the acting was laughable at best. Character development was nonexistent. The sisters ex bf was supposed to be an important character and he was like a stranger in the movie; invisible. The script writers clearly though the movie would be less of a cliche by referencing classics like fight club and sixteen candles. I would give this a 0 if I could.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

RATING IS AT THE END
Rated based on five factors... each factor will count for up to two stars added to my final rating out of 10.Quality of writingAlthough there were some moments in terms of the script that felt extremely awkward and definitely unrealistic, everything that the characters said to one another played some sort of part in the film. - +1 starsActing qualityThe acting quality in this film is kind of all over the place. At some points the interactions between the characters feels almost genuine, yet at other times it is laughably awkward. - +1 starStory / PlotVery creative idea for the film, and it felt well executed. I was initially worried that they would dive too far into detail and introduce way too many characters, however they managed to keep things organized and they avoided a confusing and cluttered mess, which is what I was most worried about for this film. Everything that happens in this movie has some sort of link to a previous section, which is great, yet sometimes the events feel almost repetitive or simply kind of either boring or expected. - +1 starAbility to keep my interestThe idea for the film itself was almost enough to keep my interest, yet all of the little character interactions that are very minor and sometimes meaningless sometimes feel important. The constant character development throughout the film also helped me escape boredom which pushes me to give a perfect score for this section. Simply, there is always something there, always some substance. - +2 starsOverall enjoymentAlthough the movie had some moments which made you smile, I don't think that this is a film I will be returning to, or heavily recommending to anyone. However I can kind of see why some would like it, but not really me. - +1 starFINAL SCORE - 6/10",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
416,jakemyers-67335,Hits the right notes at the right times without over dramatizing,8,1 September 2018,"I thought this movie was both a captivating and well made film that at its core is centered around the characters. It's more than just secret letters being discovered. It's about loving yourself to a point where you can love other, and getting to a point where you can be vulnerable with others, and I think Lara Jean was the epitome of that.The characters I feel in this movie were perfectly casted, from Noah Centineo as Peter Kavinsky, to Israel Broussard as Josh. Emotions running rampant is a very real thing in High School, and the jealousy and anger than can accompany it is important to capture in the right way, and Israel did an exceptional job at that. Noah on the other hand needed to not be overbearing or cheesy, and he struck the right balance in what I want a male lead to be in a high school rom com. The cliches in this movie make this movie predictable, but it's not what knowing the ending is, it's about how you get there, and To All the Boys I've loved before took me on a ride full of emotions orchestrated In a visually beautiful way.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

Characters are also so good.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

420,alacuesta,The Letter's Are Out!,10,17 September 2018,"Five love letters Lara Jean, played by Lana Condor, had wrote to her crushes had mysteriously been sent out to their rightful owners. This became the sweet story of Lara Jean and Peter Kavinsky. Gen's Peter, played by Noah Centineo.
 The movie began with Lara Jean describing why she has five love letters sitting in her room and who they are all addressed to. She mentions that they are her most private feelings and only writes them when her feelings are so intense there's no other way to describe them. I like how the director used variety of cast members in terms of races ages and personalities. Though the movie seemed a bit cliche with Lara Jean being a sort of ""nobody"" in high school and Peter Kavinsky being the high school jock.
Something that stood out to me when watching this film was how Lara Jean's confidence grows as the movie continues and how she isn't afraid to stand her ground when it comes to Gen, Lara Jeans ex best friend and Peter's ex girlfriend. Josh, Lara Jean's neighbor, personally seems like his role in the movie is unnecessary and seems to cause unwarranted issues for Lara Jean. 
 While this movie was at first Lara Jean's worst nightmare, having all five letters sent out, it turned into a great story for herself and lacrosse jock Peter Kavinsky. This movie was not only a teenage romcom it was a story of friendship and family.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

424,kss-46057,New Netflix Rom-Com is a Must See,10,13 October 2018,"From pages to motion pictures, To All the Boys I've Loved Before has gained a growing fan base since its release this past August. Directed by Susan Johnson, the movie brings to life the characters of Jenny Han, author of the young adult romance novel, To All the Boys I've Loved Before. This movie classifies under romantic comedies, also known as rom-coms, which are popular amongst teenagers. With the loveable characters and original plot the movie has made its way into the hearts of many. The convenient access through Netflix's streaming site has allowed thousands of young adults to watch this surprising hit as well. To All the Boys I've Loved Before should be at the top of your watch list as it is the up and coming romantic comedy of the year. 
 The story follows the life of 16-year-old, Lara Jean Covey, played by Lana Condor. She is a normal teenage but has a unique way of expressing her feelings when she gets a crush. Some people would tell a friend or keep to themselves, but Lara Jean write individual letters to each of her crushes. She has no intention of sending the letters but instead hides them in a hatbox in her room, never opened once it is written. Until one day her younger sister, Kitty, takes it upon herself to help her sister find a boyfriend, because she sees how much Lara struggles with expressing herself. Kitty then sends the letter to their designated recipients which starts the spiral of events. In total there are five letters she wrote and one of them is to the athletic and handsome, Peter Kavinsky. Peter Kavinsky, played by Noah Centineo, approaches Lara after receiving the letters with questions and a plan. He recently broke up with his girlfriend, Jen, and wanted to make her jealous so he suggested that they start a fake relationship. This wouldn't be a romance movie if there wasn't a twist and of course Lara and Peter begin to develop feelings for each other which comes with some obstacles. 
 Some people may suggest that this movie has a predictable storyline and not worth your time. Although that is the beauty of romantic comedies, they are easy to watch. There is no intricate plots that require the audience to think deeply or intense scenes that get the viewers anxious. It is a fun-loving film that brings joy to the watchers, through its ups and downs and the notorious ""on screen happily ever after fairytale"" ending. Asking for a less predictable ending is like the director to change the genre of the movie. People like predictability as well. We know what we want and when we want it. When we are in the mood for laughs and a happy ending To All the Boys I've Loved Before will be at the top of the list. 
 To All the Boys I've Loved Before, relatable narrative and characters allows the audience to connect with the story. To make sure Lara Jean and Peter's relationship convincing they make each other their background photo and post cute couple pictures on instagram. With these reference teens can put themselves in the character's shoes and feel the emotion of the story. The movie's cast and characters are just as important as the plot. The To All the Boys I've Loved Before, cast is comprised of rising actors and actresses that bring the story and emotion of the book to life. Noah Centineo who plays Peter Kavinsky is not only a great actor but not too bad to look at. He has made his way into teenage girl's hearts with his charming looks and personality on screen and off. 
 To All the Boys I've Loved Before doesn't end after the credits roll. The high ratings and reviews from the Netflix community has initiated a sequel, based off of the two remaining novels in the series, P.S. I Still Love You and Always and Forever. This movie can be credited to be one of the top romantic comedy of the year and hands down my favorite movie. So go out watch To All the Boys I've Loved Before, you might find your go to heart-melting romance movie.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
425,guoj-19724,Not Your Average Teenage Romantic Comedy,8,13 October 2018,"To All the Boys I've Loved Before is a funny, heart-warming movie that will leave you smiling and wanting to watch it over and over again. The film revolves around 17 year-old Lara Jean Covey, played by Lana Condor, who gets over crushes by writing them love letters that she never sends. When her younger sister sends out those secret letters, Lara Jean's uneventful life is suddenly turned upside down as she must make a deal with the popular boy in school, Peter Kavinsky, played by Noah Centineo. As a lover of teenage romantic comedies, I have watched many movies similar to this one. However, To All the Boys I've Loved Before rises above the rest through its integration of Korean heritage, execution of adorable scenes, and depth of family relationships. 
 One interesting quality about this romantic comedy is that it features a main character of half-Korean heritage. Her Asian background has an impact on the film without taking over as the main focus of the movie. For example, Peter and Lara Jean first start bonding over the delicious Korean yogurt drinks that Lara Jean enjoys. The emphasis on Lara Jean's Korean ethnicity adds uniqueness to the film and creates an element of cultural depth that most romantic comedies lack. Audience members of mixed heritage can relate to Lara Jean's joint ethnicities, or at least take pride in knowing that a multi-cultural family is present in mainstream media.
 Another reason why this movie is so addicting is because its lovable characters are able to bring the movie's adorable scenes to life. When you watch the film, you can feel the love and happiness that Lara Jean and Peter develop for each other. The heart-warming moments between them, such as Peter making Lara Jean his lockscreen, leaving her hand-written notes, and napping on her shoulder on the bus ride to school are sweet without being too cliché or unrealistic. As you watch the film progress, you will be reminded of the innocence of high school romances, and you will feel as if you are really witnessing two young adults fall in love. 
 Some may say that the movie does not have enough depth or emotional development; I argue that the movie weaves in meaningful elements through its portrayal of Lara Jean's family relationships. The movie is enhanced by the strong bond between Lara Jean, her sisters, and their father. Lara Jean relies on her family to comfort her and give her advice to overcome the challenges she faces throughout the film. The Covey sisters are especially close because their mother passed away when Lara Jean was younger. Her death continues to affect Lara Jean through the film, which adds a layer of interesting dimension to her character. For example, Lara Jean is unable to trust Peter at first, because she attempts to protect herself from losing another loved one by preventing any new people from entering her life. While many romantic comedies attempt similar loss storylines to develop backstory for characters, they often do so lazily and ineffectively. However, To All the Boys I've Loved Before is well thought-out in its portrayal of family loss and grief. Lara Jean's appreciation of and reliance on her father and sisters displays strong family values that will remind viewers of the unbreakable bond between family. Moreover, her growth over the film regarding her mother's passing adds complexity and emotion to the storyline.
 You should watch To All the Boys I've Loved Before because of its display of Korean culture, integration of heartwarming scenes, and detailed portrayal of family. The film is overall feel-good, hope-filled and highly relatable regarding having high school crushes, being from an Asian-American household, and developing in general as a young adult. If you are looking for a movie that is funny and adorable, yet meaningful and well-developed at the same time, then To All the Boys I've Loved Before is the perfect one for you.",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

1) storyline is completely predictable and boring, I literally wanted to fast forward this movie
2) unrealistic dialogue for 16 year olds
3) how old is Margot supposed to be? That actress is 30 and does not look like a 19 year old at all
4) the character of the dad is completely devoid of purpose
5) the letters story line is not well thought out, the only boys who are important are the neighbor and the jock",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

It's what you'd expect- an aesthetically-pleasing teen chicklit film with a few clichés thrown in here and there. Most of the hype was focused around certain actors- cough,Noah,cough- but the acting was great and it was generally a pretty good movie. (Although, I definitely preferred the novel, it was much better & detailed, and it's a trilogy, for those who dont know.)",To All the Boys I've Loved Before

432,jennypetty-03440,Netflix Knocks it Out of the Park Again with the New Movie to All the Boys I've Loved Before,9,16 January 2019,"To All the Boys I've Loved Before is a touching film about the modern-day drama within high school romances. This heart-warming, witty film will make you fall in love with the story the same way Lara Jean falls in love. Netflix has hit it out of the park again with another great film.Lana Condor lands the lead role playing, Lara Jean, an unpopular, middle child, high schooler, who is very easy to relate to. Living with her sisters/best friends, Margo (Janel Parrish) and Kitty (Anna Cathcart), and father (John Corbett), she has to face high school without a mom, who died when Lara Jean was very young. As a romance-novel-fanatic, Lara Jean has written her own type of fantasy romance by writing secret letters to the five boys she has loved before, with no intention of them getting out. Mysteriously all of the letters get sent out, causing her fantasy to become reality. All of her secret confessions have now been seen by the recipients of the letters, causing lots of intriguing drama between her and the boys, throughout her junior year.The ending is one of the best endings to a film I have seen. The scene is similar to the ending scene ofThe Breakfast Clubby ending on a field in order to emphasize the importance of a film the two main characters claimed was one of their favorite movies. It alludes to a significant ending and what could happen with the squeal to the film that was announced to be official in December 2019, but that is all I can say without giving it away. Although it is entertaining throughout the whole movie the fantastic ending with the added drama and twists forces your emotions to be all over the place. It constantly tugs on your heart for Lara Jean and what she should do about the sticky situations she gets into at the end of the movie.
The movie references so older movies like, 16 Candles, Fight Club, and has some similar aspects, including the ending, of The Breakfast Club. The use of going back to these movies helps the story develop further and giving the old-timer taste to a good movie.The lead role in this movie was spectacularly played by Condor, a rookie to leads in films. Although this is her first lead, she handles the role with ease and makes it seem like this is not her first rodeo. Her costar, Noah Centineo, has starred in the Disney film, How to Build a Better Boy, The Fosters, and another new Netflix film, Sierra Burgess is a Loser and outperforms all of his other performances in the movie. Centineo stars as Peter Kavinsky, one of the boys to receive a letter, play a hunky jock who, despites the stereotype, is also emotionally vulnerable. Both of the actors true engage you into the film causing you to continue to be drawn to every scene.Although the storyline of the movie is pretty commonly told, high school relationships and their struggles, the details within the film brings a sweet, funny aspect to high school romance. It provides a certain lightness, through comedy, to some of the hardship high schoolers faces which further brings the audience into the film. Despite the humor used in the film, it also brings a needed seriousness to certain scenes to show just how hard the hardships can be in high school.The film is based on the young author, Jenny Han's novel, and is produced by Will Smith's production company. They supported her idea of having an Asian-American play the lead role in the film. The director, Susan Johnson, who also directed the drama-comedy, Carrie Pilby. She upped her game with the film To All the Boys I've Loved Before, to the point where it became one of the most popular films to be streamed on Netflix when it first came out. The internet was buzzing about the movie for weeks including the Instagram promotional page that now has over a million followers.Many people question if To All the Boys I've Loved Before, Is this just another cheesy romcom? or Is it really any different than any other love story? I personally believe that this film brings different aspects to love stories, that has unexpected twists and turns to keep the audience intrigued, with a spectacular ending. This movie has reached the top of my list of recommendations and is a movie I can watch over and over again. I cannot wait until the sequel comes out to see if it can live up to the first film!",To All the Boys I've Loved Before
