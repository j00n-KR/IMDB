0,MartinHafer,"""Something like that doesn't make you a bad person....",3,29 August 2017,"The film begins shortly after Francesca's death and her children are confronted with a big surprise...their mother was not faithful to their father and, oddly, wrote it all down and left evidence of the affair for the children to find (huh??)! What follows is a jump back to the 1960s, when an Iowa farm wife (Meryl Streep) meets and falls in love with a roving photographer for ""National Geographic"", Robert (Clint Eastwood). There you see how the pair meet and their very, very brief affair that lasted only a few short days.As for Francesca's grown children, at first they are horrified but over time they seem to think it was cool that their mother had this hidden life. The above quote is spoken by the daughter in ""The Bridges of Madison County"". It's referring to her mother's affair with a relative stranger. Perhaps I am overly moralistic and judgmental, but to me this DOES make her mother a bad person...though it would not seem to be so by Hollywood standards. And, to me, this is the fundamental problem with the film. While it's artfully acted, gorgeously made and directed...ultimately it's a film that romanticizes adultery. If the lady's husband had been physically abusive or evil, perhaps you could understand her actions...but his biggest crime is he was dull...and the wife never seemed to tell him she wasn't satisfied. You'd think she'd owe it to the guy or perhaps ask for a divorce. To me, that makes this a film that is tough to enjoy...as I felt bad for the husband...as I would if my wife went off and had an affair with someone else. And, I would sure hope my wife would feel the same way about this film and its message about a 'nice' affair.",The Bridges of Madison County
1,bkoganbing,While The Family Was At The Fair,9,2 February 2010,"The image of Clint Eastwood, firmly ingrained in the minds of the movie-going public is that of a man of few words and lots of actions to back up what little words he does employ. So to see this multi-talented and complex man directing himself and starring in an old fashioned romantic story is a pleasant surprise. Made even more pleasant in how well it was done.The children of Meryl Streep are gathered for her funeral and are astonished at a request left by her not to be buried next to her husband and their father. Instead she wants to be cremated and her ashes thrown off a wooden bridge in the area and in the creek it runs over. Later on her grown children Annie Corley and Victor Slezak find a letter among their mother's effects and it's a lengthy one and she explains her reasons for this.One day back in the early sixties when the kids and husband Jim Haynie left for the state fair, National Geographic Photographer Clint Eastwood stops by and asks Streep for directions. He's in the area to photograph the picturesque Bridges Of Madison County. Meryl is attracted by the stranger and it takes awhile, but before long she realizes she's found the true love of her life.The issue of Meryl being Italian is there, but not overstated in the screenplay. She like thousands of others was a war bride brought over from Europe by GIs. There was a no fraternization policy that was enforced somewhat, but true love or true hormones obey no government edicts. A lot of these marriages worked. In fact Meryl's to Jim Haynie worked because no one found out about her indiscretion to Eastwood until after both of them died. She says herself that the transition from Italy to Iowa was a traumatic one, but she wanted to make it because she'd be going to America and a better life.Meryl Streep received one of her sixteen Academy Award nominations for this role, the only recognition the Academy gave to The Bridges Of Madison County. Sad too because Clint Eastwood who is a man always challenging himself showed that their could be a tender a romantic side to Dirty Harry Callahan. In fact while watching The Bridges Of Madison County I guarantee you won't once think of any of Clint's action heroes.Director Eastwood also exquisitely photographed the Iowa countryside on location in Winterset Iowa which already had its place in Hollywood lore as the birthplace of John Wayne. The Bridges Of Madison County is one of those tender romantic stories showing the fires of romance can still burn in people other than the young. But the film is for romantics of all ages.",The Bridges of Madison County
2,Leofwine_draca,Slow-burning romance,4,30 December 2019,"THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is something different from Eastwood as star and director: a slow-burning romance, told in flashback, that takes place over just four days. It's reminiscent of BRIEF ENCOUNTER but otherwise very '90s in feel, all homely and warm and with good-natured people throughout. If I'm honest, I found it all more than a little dull, although the naturalistic performances are fine. Streep's Italian immigrant character smacks of cliche and, although Eastwood is as charming as ever, he doesn't seem to have much drive here. This reminded me of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE but without the plot and suspense.",The Bridges of Madison County
3,SnoopyStyle,simple bittersweet story,8,11 January 2016,The family of Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) is dealing with her final wish after her death. She wants to be cremated and her ashes scattered from Roseman Bridge. They discover pictures taken in 1965 and her emotional affair with famed National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) whose ashes were scattered from the bridge. Her kids read her accounts of those four days. Her family went to the Illinois state fair. Robert was on assignment to film the bridge and stopped to ask directions from Italian war bride Francesca.It's a simple bittersweet story. Director Clint Eastwood doesn't add anything overtly melodramatic. Meryl Streep is pitch-perfect. She's an expert on calibrating her accents but it's her every simple gesture that is so precise. She could teach an acting class from this movie. The story is basically laid out in the first ten minutes before either Streep or Eastwood is even on the screen. That is its most obvious drawback. It's not a movie of twists and mysteries. It is however a movie of emotional depth and her children are a big part of it.,The Bridges of Madison County
4,Hitchcoc,An Actor's Film,9,9 February 2010,"I just chanced on this on public television. I had never had any interest in it for whatever reason. Five minutes in and I was hooked. This is a quiet movie about someone who has given up her life for her family. She has left her European home to be with her husband. He is a good man but really pretty dull. Her kids are spoiled and inconsiderate. When Kincaid shows up, he offers her four days to ponder the rest of her life. Some criticize the morality of it. The movie is so well paced and so gentle, that the relationships between the characters come softly in the night. The subtly facial expressions and nuances show us what real pros can do. It's so nice to see Eastwood grow better all the time, not just Rawhide or Dirty Harry (not that there is anything wrong), but a fine, confident performance of a lonely man who finds his four days as well. The worlds of the two characters are so different yet they become kindred spirits and lovers. I appreciated that at no time was there a possibility that they would be caught red-handed. Good writing; good directing.",The Bridges of Madison County
5,classicsoncall,"""We let the day take us where we wanted.""",9,10 October 2019,"Truly incredible performances by Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood carry this film to an utterly heart rending conclusion; it's a film that hopeless romantics can identify with and be touched by. There is however the moral dilemma of a wife cheating on her husband and potentially throwing away an entire life that came before. The smartly written screenplay by Richard LaGravenese is skillfully handled by director Eastwood, juggling duties on both sides of the camera in a way that challenges his tough guy persona in the type of films he's more generally recognized for. The story arc is bookended by the adult children of Francesca Johnson (Streep) questioning her last will and testament and ultimately, the secret she bore for the remainder of her life following a four day affair with photographer Richard Kincaid (Eastwood), while on assignment in Madison County, Iowa. There pervades in the story the inevitable conflict that must be faced when Francesca's family eventually returns from their state fair sojourn, giving rise to a fateful decision that will reverberate for the remainder of their days. The tear inducing scene of Kincaid standing in the rain as Francesca tries to suppress her sorrow is one of the most heartfelt sequences one might encounter in film, carrying with it a finality that threatens to sentence it's participants to lives of melancholy. Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted, ""The Bridges of Madison County"" is a high water mark in the careers of both of it's principals, and a movie not to be missed.",The Bridges of Madison County
6,gavin6942,"An Unusual Tale of Love, Loneliness and Infidelity",7,25 September 2012,"Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever.This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong.Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?",The Bridges of Madison County
7,jboothmillard,The Bridges of Madison County,8,5 May 2008,"I had heard many things about this film based on the successful novel, and starring, produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, mostly how much it makes people cry, so naturally I knew to give it a go. Basically the mother of brother and sister Carolyn (Annie Corley) and Michael Johnson (Victor Slezak) has died, and in her will she gives instructions of a new death plan, being cremated and her ashes scattered off a bridge in Madison County, like the man she mentions, Robert Kincaid (Eastwood). In her box of possessions, she has written the story of her and Robert, and this is where the film goes to flashback. Italian mother and wife Francesca Johnson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) is alone for four days while her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) are away at the Iowa state fair. She sees a car pulling up to her house, it is Robert asking for directions to a bridge that he needs to photograph, and she decides to take him there. He takes the pictures and takes her back to the house, and she invites him in for a drink, and then a little later when he planned to leave for dinner. You can tell Francesca is really attracted to Robert, but we're not sure about him. Day 2, he comes back and they spend some more time together at the bridge again. It is later in the evening where they become a lot closer, and eventually kiss and end up in bed together. The next day there is a little squabble about the affair situation, and after day four he decides it is right that he should leave, and Richard and the kids (till now) never found out. Years later, Richard is on his death bed, and Francesca every year always visits spots Robert used to go on her birthday. Of course she discovers he has died when his attorney sends her many of his things. Carolyn and Michael of course understand how passionately their mother felt for Robert in those four days, and how the memory of him helped her survive till death, so they honour her wishes. A very touching story that you can feel more than one way about, i.e. is the affair wrong or right, and who should Francesca be with? It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Streep was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!",The Bridges of Madison County
8,ccthemovieman-1,A Sad Comment On The Times,1,23 July 2007,"This was a popular movie from an even-more popular book, and it was particularly attractive to women. It deals with an adulterous relationship. Apparently, that's okay if it's the woman is doing the cheating on the husband! Yeah, a photographer (Clint Eastwood) comes by and has a fling for a few days with a housewife...and this was supposed to be a ""wonderful, feel-good film?"" Yeah, those are the adjectives I read over and over from sick national critics. What a comment on their morals as well everyone who thought this was just great. Yes, times have changed, and the film industry many times leads the way in showing bad to be good and vice-versa. I did not know what the film was about, only read the rave reviews, and spent my money on it. What a mistake. Meryl Streep plays bored Iowa housewife and mother, ""Francesca,"" who jumps in the sack with a perfect stranger after her husband and kids go away to the county fair for four days. Wow, that's admirable of her! Gosh, this story is so ""sensitive, romantic, poignant, brilliant, breathtaking, beautiful, timeless, warm and fuzzy,"" etc. Those are just some of the headlines here in these user comments. I'm not kidding. It brought many women ""to tears."" Wow, I just hope guys don't marry those women.To those people who think this is so warm, fuzzy and romantic, I wonder what your reaction would be if that was YOUR husband or wife cheating on you?I was sorry to see Eastwood and Streep be a part of this schlock. Eastwood should stick to his tough-guy roles and leave this kind of nonsense to Hugh Grant.",The Bridges of Madison County
9,moonspinner55,Should please admirers of the book...and Streep gives it added sparkle,5,9 October 2010,"Unfulfilled housewife in Iowa (Meryl Streep) has a brief but passionate affair with a photographer passing through town (Clint Eastwood, who also directed). Sterling adaptation of Robert James Waller's phenomenal bestseller, which had romantics gushing from coast to coast, though one which leans heavily on the stars for much of its charm; the story is unnecessarily framed in corny past-and-present structure, and Eastwood lays it all out in the most elementary of terms. The pacing is much too careful and lethargic, however Clint's chemistry with a curiously cast yet exceptional Meryl Streep is captured well. Her performance alone makes the picture worth-seeing; soft, yet earthy and gutsy--and with a convincing Italian accent--Streep manages a full-blooded character, someone with whom audiences can instantly identify. She makes ""Bridges"" a memorable entertainment, if not quite an eventful one. ** from ****",The Bridges of Madison County
10,Quinoa1984,"uncertainty in a certain world, with two mega-star icons falling in love with no punches pulled",9,16 February 2009,"It would be easy to go into The Bridges of Madison County with trepidation. It looks like one of those real hardcore chick-flick romances, where a bunch of middle-aged-to-elderly housewives and lonely women go in and imagine themselves in the part of Francesca being possibly taken away by Robert Kincaid to far away places. And no wonder since it was first a book that was a major hit - and also, from all accounts I've heard, a trashy piece of mainstream for-women work. But the factor of Clint Eastwood is a curious one, especially since he's rarely had movies that were about just two people in love (the closest one can find are in the 70s with Play Misty for Me, which is more of a thriller, and the obscure Breezy). It turns out he was an excellent choice to direct the picture, as well as appear as co-lead, because he never second-guesses or pushes the material where it would feel false.In fact, this is one of the more realistic ""weepie"" love story films I have come across, at least from recent memory. It starts with the dialog and the characters, and whatever writer Richard LaGravanese was able to take away from the book he made it work for Eastwood's aesthetic, which is that of two people who meet, have actual conversations without pablum or hokey bits, and even when the occasional self-indulgent narration bits from Francesca come up they're not un-welcome. When we see this man Robert come into Francesca's life it's very natural, or appears to be as much as it could be for these two people. Then as things deepen, albeit quickly, this becomes part of the romantic feel that is captured with subtlety and delicacy. So, when the real dramatic quandaries come around- of whether or not this woman will leave her husband, who is a good man without anything on him to make him villainous, and her kids- it too is dealt with rationally, with a sense of tragedy but humanity.Bridges of Madison County is nothing if not a very human tale of love and loss. It's a ""chick-flick"" with all of its clichés pared down, stripped away of all their chicken fat and shown with the bones that make them work for just any viewer looking for a good story, love or otherwise. And Eastwood is also very good at including the plot device of the two 40-something kids reading through the late Francesca's journals- their own experiences as people are brought in to the narrative wonderfully. All in all, the story reveals the filmmaker to have such a great sense of what makes a good romance film- a hopeless romance, perhaps, in a similar mold of the films of Wong Kar Wai- while also being able to have us connect with these people. The wife commits infidelity, but it's hard to really side either way. They're too real and too conflicted to stick on any one side (some may disagree, which maybe will reveal more about themselves than the actual film, which is interesting), which is rare.And what about the stars? This and Heat are, clearly, the films that in 1995 had iconic stars of their generation on screen facing off. Whereas Pacino and DeNiro had one scene, Clint and Streep have the bulk of the picture to hang on to. It goes without saying Streep lays bare her characters flaws and conflicts and joy so well, a given perhaps, but the real revelation is Eastwood. Who knew such a man who usually eats grit for breakfast and in later years has a gravel-chiseled profile has such a tender soul to lay bare? There are some who will avoid the picture just for this reason, which perhaps is fair; no one wants to see their tough-guy icon showing how ""soft"" and vulnerable they can be on camera. But for those willing to take a look, it's one of his bravest and maybe even just best performances (as with a recent Sean Penn in Milk, you'll rarely see Eastwood just smile this much, which is great).",The Bridges of Madison County
11,sunwarrior13,Better Than The Novella,10,26 September 2012,"The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced.The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.",The Bridges of Madison County

13,Doylenf,"Honest emotions, touching story, deeply felt performances...",7,26 February 2005,"I put off watching THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY because I expected it to be a lot of sentimental nonsense about two aging fools who fall in love at first sight before the soap suds become thicker and thicker.Well, I was wrong. I have to confess that I was afraid I'd have to put up with another Meryl Streep accent that would leave half of her words unintelligible, but again I was wrong. Streep gets across the Italian ancestry without too heavy an accent and gives a remarkably fine performance, doing so much with her eyes and expressive face that she doesn't even need dialogue. She shows us the pain just below the surface--and the boredom and loneliness of the housewife who yearns for something missing in her marriage relationship.And Clint Eastwood scores too, this time without guns or tough guy lines that we're used to hearing from him. He does an honest, realistic and natural job of acting that makes him seem what he is supposed to be--a traveling photographer with the National Geographic intent on filming some of those lovely New England bridges.The story moves just a little too slowly for comfort at times and this is the only major flaw because it's told in such an honest fashion from beginning to end. Streep's children are extremely well played and their viewpoint is understandable when they discover the diaries she has kept of her four day love affair.Touching and straightforward in its simplicity, there is much to admire about the film. Streep and Eastwood are at their level best. The color photography is a treat and so is the unobtrusive background score.Again, the only real flaw is the length. It's the kind of relationship tale that could have been told just as effectively without scenes that are held too long.",The Bridges of Madison County
14,preppy-3,Quiet and affecting,9,17 February 2006,In the 1960s a somewhat dissatisfied farmers housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep meets photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Her husband and kids are away for four days--and they both start to fall in love with each other.This was a big hit in 1995 to everyones surprise. It was just a simple love story but everybody seemed to love it. It IS good. The script is excellent--everybody talks and acts like real people. Nothing is overstated--everything is quiet and subtle allowing the audience to discover the characters for themselves. Eastwood is excellent and Streep is superb--she was justly nominated for an Academy award for this performance. It is very good...but it just fell a little short for me.It moves a little too slow--this doesn't have to run over two hours. I also thought the rainstorm ending was a bit much. It just never connected with me emotionally--I usually cry during movies like this but I was completely dry-eyed during this. So it IS a good movie (I give it a 9) but just didn't completely work for me. Worth catching though.,The Bridges of Madison County
15,grantss,Emotional drama,8,17 May 2014,"Emotional romance-drama. Possibly Clint Eastwood's most romantic movie, and one of his most sensitive (only Million Dollar Baby is more so, I think). Though it is quite schmaltzy (and perhaps overly so), it is not your average romance-drama. It is about choices and how these affect your life and the lives of those around you.Eastwood displays his usual subtle direction. No spoonfeeding details or superfluous information. He does draw out some of the moments a bit much though.Superb performance from Meryl Streep, as you would expect. Deservedly got her a Leading Actress Oscar nomination. Clint Eastwood gives the most gentle and deep performance of his life. More than these individual performances, the chemistry between Streep and Eastwood is spot-on.Decent supporting performances, mostly. Victor Slezak, as the son Michael, is probably the weakest link, not being 100% convincing, and often over-acting.",The Bridges of Madison County
16,HotToastyRag,Such an improvement to the story,10,21 April 2020,"The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic masterpiece, but it's so incredibly heart wrenching, most people only want to see it once. I have a DVD copy in my collection, but the cellophane is still on it. It's a wonderful movie in every facet, and some-including yours truly-name it as legendary Meryl Streep's finest performance. Clint Eastwood wears two hats, and his thoughtful and sensitive directing makes it seem like you're watching someone's life unfold, rather than going to the movies.Richard LaGravenese's screenplay brings an entirely new meaning to the story, and if you run out and buy a copy of the original novel after watching the movie, you'll be severely disappointed. The book contains a love story between an unsatisfied housewife and a visiting photographer. The movie proves their sacrifice had meaning. The film starts out informing the audience that Meryl Streep has died and she wishes her ashes to be scattered over the bridges of Madison County, rather than to be laid to rest next to her husband. Her adult children, Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, are understandably confused, but when they come across a set of journals written by their mother, they learn of a brief love affair she had when they were children. Annie and Victor are struggling in their own lives, and learning more about their mother helps them navigate and learn. If you can believe it, the book doesn't include any of that! The housewife doesn't die, her children don't grow up, and she isn't able to continue to mother them beyond the grave. Where's the poignancy? Where are the final tears they could have wrung out of their readers? To me, the parallel storyline with the adult children is what makes this movie a tear-jerking classic.
There are so many beautiful scenes that have staying in my memory, as I'm sure they've stayed in yours, even though it's been over ten years since I've watched it. I remember how many Kleenexes I went through during each part of the movie, which is probably why I haven't broken open that cellophane. My heart breaks when Meryl presses a shaky hand to the car door, and although I'm not a mother myself, I appreciate her wonderful expression as she closes her heart before greeting her children.Getting past the tears, there's so much wonderful acting in this movie that makes you wonder how Meryl ever lost the Academy Award, and why Clint wasn't even nominated, since it's his finest hour as well. Perfectly cast as a drifter with dreams that have passed him by, he could have easily come across as either a sleazy Harold Hill-type who wants a fling with a grateful housewife, or an unrealistic romantic. He's neither, and because the love they share is mutual, the story works.If you've never seen it, you've got to pick the right moment to watch The Bridges of Madison County for the first time. Don't watch it after a breakup, and don't watch it when you're feeling blue. You'll need all your strength to get through it. But you'll be rewarded. You'll get to see two career-best performances in an indelible love story, and you'll find yourself wondering if Meryl Streep is secretly Italian and has hidden her accent in all her other movies.",The Bridges of Madison County
17,Wuchakk,Real-life questions about love and infidelity,8,22 June 2020,"RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Clint Eastwood, ""The Bridges of Madison County"" details what happens in 1965 when a world-traveling photographer for National Geographic (Eastwood) inadvertently meets an Iowa Farm wife (Meryl Streep).This is a drama about the nature of eros love and potential infidelity that will only be appreciated by mature viewers. It consists of two people meeting, getting acquainted, discovering something profound and then forced to make decisions that'll determine the rest of their lives, as well as the consequences for those linked to them.Some questions addressed include: What if you're married and you meet someone you genuinely romantically love? What if you're single and you meet a married person you profoundly love? How far do you (or can you) wisely take the relationship? What about others who would be negatively affected by pursuing the relationship?These are all honest questions that most people have to consider at one time or another in their lives. The movie's not corrupt for asking them or featuring a certain questionable act any more than the story of David & Bathsheba makes the Bible corrupt (or, arguably worse, the story of Judah & Tamar).One character is too loose with morals, which he justifies by criticizing all the ""borders"" in life. But there are boundaries everywhere: National, state, county, city, school, government, business, social and... marital. The bottom line is: You're either married or you're not. If you're married that means you have a committed lifelong covenant with your spouse. That's what taking vows is all about. The movie tries to have its cake and eat it too by supporting such loyalty while flirting with the temptation to discard it in the name of true love. regardless, the picture smacks of real life, real people, real (hard) decisions and is very well done, which is to be expected with Eastwood at the helm.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Winterset & Adel, Iowa.GRADE: A-",The Bridges of Madison County
18,Sylviastel,Nobody but Eastwood and Streep!,7,7 November 2009,"The book may have been lame about a four day relationship between a war bride Francesca played by the dynamic Meryl Streep and a National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid. Her husband, Richard, and two children go to the Illinois State Fair. While going over their deceased mother's belongings, they discover their mother's secret romance with the photographer. Meryl Streep is sensational and believable as this simple housewife in Iowa. She loves her husband and children but probably wanted something more. Then Clint Eastwood as Robert Kincaid shows up asking where a covered bridge is in Madison County, the relationship is short-lived and a decision has to be made about their clandestine affair. Anyway despite all the obvious problems, Eastwood and Streep pull this movie through. I liked Annie Corley and Victor Slezak as the adult children who make the starting discovery about their mother.",The Bridges of Madison County
19,JamesHitchcock,Such are the dreams of the everyday housewife,8,6 July 2007,"Francesca Johnson, the Italian-born wife of a farmer in Madison County, Iowa, meets Robert Kincaid, a photographer, when he stops to ask directions. (Kincaid is on an assignment for ""National Geographic"" to photograph the area's famous covered bridges, hence the title of the film). A friendship grows up between them, which turns to love, and they have a brief affair while Francesca's husband Richard and her teenage children are away for a few days at the State Fair. Robert wants Francesca to leave her husband for him, but she refuses. Although she has fallen deeply in love with Robert, she is unwilling to hurt her husband and children and is afraid that her love for Robert will fade should she take the irrevocable step of ending her marriage for him.This could easily be the plot of some cheap, sentimental movie, but ""The Bridges of Madison County"" avoids falling into the traps of cheapness and sentimentality. Part of the reason is that it starred two of Hollywood's most talented actors, Meryl Streep as Francesca and Clint Eastwood as Robert. Eastwood was perhaps an unexpected choice, given that he was in his mid-sixties at the time and that in the past he had been most often associated with violent action films, particularly Westerns and police thrillers. In recent years, however, he has been keen to extend his range as an actor, and his role here is an example. Those who felt that he could not play a romantic hero in a film more concerned with emotions than with action were to be proved wrong. Not only is he surprisingly handsome and virile for a man of his years (how many sixty-five year-old actors would dare do a scene bare-chested as Eastwood does here?) but he brings far more tenderness and sensitivity to the role than one would expect from the man who created Dirty Harry and the High Plains Drifter.Although her previous attempt to play the heroine of a doomed romance, in ""Falling in Love"" about a decade earlier, was not a great success, Streep is superb as Francesca (but then, she normally is superb). Playing an Italian gives her the chance to add another to her collection of accents, but there is always more to Streep than her talent for mimicry. What convinces us that she is foreign born is not only her accent but also her mannerisms and her slight hesitancy when speaking, as though she is groping, albeit only momentarily, for words in a language not her own.Eastwood also directed the film, and the style of direction is an unusual one for a modern movie. In the thirties and forties many films were made in the ""filmed theatre"" style (usually forced on the directors of the day by technical limitations). Films of this type were made in a studio, generally with an indoor setting. There was more dialogue than action, and the film's literary qualities were more important than its visual ones. This style of film-making fell out of favour as the technological abilities of the cinema advanced- even when a modern film is actually based on a stage play an attempt is normally made to ""open it up""- but Eastwood seems to be reverting to it here. Although there are a few outdoor scenes, including shots of one of the covered bridges which takes on an important significance, much of the action takes place in Francesca's home, particularly her kitchen, where she and Robert hold long conversations. They do not actually move into the bedroom until more than halfway through.This style of film-making has the advantage of enabling us to build up a picture of Francesca's marriage without this having to be shown in detail. In the great nineteenth-century novels of female adultery, such as ""Anna Karenina"", ""Madame Bovary"" or Fontane's ""Effi Briest"" it became something of a convention to depict the husband in an unflattering light, thus providing an explanation for his wife's infidelity. That convention in not followed in this film. We see little of Richard, but from what we hear of him he is neither a booby like Charles Bovary nor a cold bully like Karenin. Francesca describes him as very clean, hard-working, gentle and a good father. Yet from her conversations with Robert, we can understand why she is dissatisfied in her marriage. She married Richard shortly after the war, when he was a soldier stationed in Italy. (The film is set in the mid-sixties). It becomes clear that the young Francesca saw marriage as a means to escape from her own war-ravaged country. She seems to have fallen in love with the idea of America as a land of opportunity rather than Richard as a person, and life as Mid-West farmer's wife has not fulfilled her expectations, leaving her nostalgic for her homeland. The life of the cosmopolitan, widely-travelled Robert seems more glamorous than the one she is leading.The one thing I did not like about the film was the ""framework story"", set in the nineties, in which Francesca's children, now adults, discover the truth about their mother's affair from documents she leaves behind after her death. I felt that the story of Francesca and Robert was strong enough to stand on its own without this unnecessary addition, especially as the nineties subplot had a rather moralising tone at odds with that of the main story. The film as a whole, however, is very good, touching and well-made, with great insight into what Glen Campbell called ""the dreams of the everyday housewife"". 8/10",The Bridges of Madison County
20,namashi_1,A Film For The Elders...,6,6 April 2011,"A film like 'The Bridges Of Madison County' is meant for the elders, it's a touching tale of 2 elders who fall in love with each-other over a course of 4 days.Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Robert James Waller, Cinema Legend Clint Eastwood directs this sweet tale nicely. Also, Meryl Streep's power-house performance helps elevate the film.'The Bridges Of Madison County' tells the story of Francesca Johnson, played by Streep, a lonely, insightful Italian housewife in Iowa. While her husband and children are away at the Illinois State Fair, she meets and falls in love with a photographer, Robert Kincaid, played by Eastwood, who has come to Madison County, Iowa to shoot a photographic essay for National Geographic on the covered bridges in the area.The film begins well, and the 1st interaction between the hero and heroine is charming. However, the writing falters in the middle, and even the pace dips. But, a emotional & challenging finale makes up for it. Richard LaGravenese's Adapted Screenplay offers some really nice dialogue, while Eastwood proves his mettle as a filmmaker yet again. Cinematography & Editing are fine.Performance-Wise: Streep rules the show with a power-house performance.

23,ElMaruecan82,When good adultery doesn't necessarily depend on bad marriage...,9,30 June 2018,"When an Italian girl falls in love with an American GI, she doesn't exactly picture the America of her dreams as a farm in Iowa. Yet Francesca has been a dedicated wife and mother for twenty years, as commitment meant something to those who bore the baby boom generation. But it didn't make their generation, nor any generation since the dawn of humanity, immune to a heated and passionate romance... especially when the mysterious stranger who knocks at your door is Clint Eastwood?Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese credited the actor-director for giving him the right advice when it came to adapt Robert James Waller's best-seller ""The Bridges of Madison County"". When a book is that popular, no need for extra plot elements that might alienate your potential audience without drawing a new one. Eastwood's point was that the story of a four-day romance between a housewife from Iowa and a free-spirited photographer was speaking for itself already, all a script had to do was keeping the material mature, and well... romantic.And Eastwood applied his own advice behind the camera. Not that he ever indulged to fancy directing or editing but he didn't let any artistic license deviate the story from the original romance. Indeed, ""The Bridges of Madison County"" is about two adults, not bad persons, surrendering to the impulsiveness of a moment, not out of foolishness but precisely because only people their age are aware that destiny can sneak at anytime, and that unpredictable episodes are to be seized, no matter how brief the encounter. Doesn't that ring a bell? Eastwood intended to make an old-fashioned romance, it turned out to be the spiritual successor of David Lean's 1945 classic, the film LaGravenese saw after being advised to tone down his enthusiasm. And ""Brief Encounter"" was great because it ended with the right bittersweet tone. The husband understood that his wife was 'away' for awhile and wherever she went, he was glad she was back to him. It was the film's emotional peak, showing that marriage isn't an existential dead-end. Adultery can say a lot about marriage and responsibility, and sacrificing one's passion might be the price to pay for a memory you'll treasure for the rest of your life. And like the train station in ""Encounter"", bridges play the role of the connecting place. Robert Kincaid came to Iowa to shoot one of these picturesque bridges that could belong to a Southern postcard or a Mark Twain illustration. The city dweller and globe trotter loves the breath of Iowa and the charm of the landscape but Francesca didn't really pay attention until she walked across the bridge, which felt like a first time, as if there was indeed something new in the air. And Streep, like Eastwood, can say so much without speaking, the way she moves, walks and peeps into Robert say enough. And the way the romance slowly takes form is like a sparkle stirring up until it becomes a bonfire of emotions, and the performances of the two actors are integral to the romance's believability. Clint Eastwood plays it in a understated tone that hardly hides his vulnerability during some pivotal moments. When Francesca asks him for a tea, then a dinner, there's something in his ""yes"" that says ""I'm glad you asked"". And then you have Meryl Streep, in her first Oscar-nominated performance after five years (the longest she ever waited). She doesn't play the frustrated housewife, she's not even shy or ugly by movie standards. In the opening dinner scene, you can read in her saddened expression how estranged she had become to her own family, but she later warns her husband not to smoke and gently pats his cheek, she's a touchstone in her family. And it was the right touch not to depict the husband (Jim Haynie) as an abusive or bad man, you can make 'good adultery' without relying on a 'bad marriage.' That's a truth of life.Another truth, albeit less existential is that there's also a lot of smoking and drinking in the film, I guess a man always takes it as a good sign where a woman loosens up with him... but this isn't about sex, it's about creating the kind of atmosphere where Francesca and Robert can relax and be themselves. At one moment, Robert tells a funny story and it's less the story that matters but her body language, the spontaneous yet sensual way she lifts her legs, her childish excitement that makes her irresistible to the point of sexiness. She gets even more beautiful as days and nights go by, reaching their pinnacle in the last night before the departure, unlike ""Brief Encounter"", they have their moment and it's shown with enough lighting to make it erotic. Then comes the bitter 'morning after', a powerful argument and a choice to be made. For all the talk about love and life, the film manages to say more in quieter moments such as Eastwood staring at Francesca under the rain. Earlier, he was that dashing man with long white hair and a vigorous torso shining under the sun, then he looked almost bald with the eyes of a kicked puppy. And you have the climactic shot of Francesca's hand on the car's handle... will she decide to join his car or stay with his husband? The book was a wide success because of its polarizing dilemma. It's not about satisfying one audience in particular but making everyone understand either choice. As it's said in the film, ""we're all the choices we've made"" and there will always come a moment for regrets, apologies and forgiveness, even the husband has such a moment. And although their 180° turn isn't as smooth and believable as the main story, Francesca's children embrace their lives with the spirit of that four-day but life-changing romance, one that says a lot about life, choices and commitment. After all, what good romance doesn't?",The Bridges of Madison County
24,MOscarbradley,There won't be a dry eye in the house!,9,17 July 2007,"On the page ""The Bridges of Madison County"" often read like a reject from Mills and Boon and yet it was tremendously popular. People who normally wouldn't read this sort of thing were not only reading it but quoting it. You could say that for some people it held the kind of camp appeal that bad books sometimes do for the so-called intelligentsia. Personally, I am inclined to think that its tale of middle-aged romance struck a cord. It may not have been well-written but many people recognized in its two central characters a reflection of themselves. It spoke of a great passion and a great loss; a ""Brief Encounter"" for the nineties. Still, it never quite seemed like a vehicle for Clint Eastwood; (once upon a time you might have envisaged Arthur Hiller doing it), yet here it is, larger than life on the big screen and utterly lovely, utterly heart-breaking.Perhaps Eastwood chose to film it as a vehicle for himself. He wears the mantle of the ageing Lothario perfectly at an age when most romantic leads are played by much younger men, (or are simply non-existent), yet who blanched when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant were wooing Audrey Hepburn well into their old age. Admittedly Eastwood isn't entirely comfortable in this sort of role. He's not a versatile actor. His best performances have been as tortured losers or just old-fashioned tough guys but under his own direction he blossoms here. Of course, the 'romantic' in Eastwood has never been hard to find. You need look only to the scores he has composed. (He has written the main love theme here and his use of classic jazz standards by the likes of Dinah Washington and Johnny Hartman adds considerably to the film's beating heart).What is remarkable is that essentially Eastwood's film is really something of a chamber piece for two players. A few other characters flit into the frame but for most of the time there is no one on screen but Eastwood and co-star Meryl Streep and this is one of Streep's great performances. As Francesca, the woman who finds in Eastwood's photographer Robert the one great passion in her life albeit briefly and at a time when the likelihood of such a thing happening was remote indeed, Streep is extraordinary. Sometimes Streep can overwhelm a project; her versatility doesn't always work in favour of lesser material. But here she seems to have tapped quite effortlessly, not just into the consciousness of her character, but into her very soul as well. And if that sounds cheesy, let me assure you it isn't. Cheesiness isn't in Streep's vocabulary, even if it is in mine! Perhaps Eastwood was able to discern in Robert James Waller's novel the seeds of a great love story or perhaps he just felt he could bring his artistry to bear on some unlikely source material. Whatever, it's paid off. On screen ""The Bridges of Madison County"" is a great love story; there won't be a dry eye in the house.",The Bridges of Madison County

As we got in to a heated argument just before we went in to see the movie!! I sat through the full movie in a foul mood, and I hated it!! I didn't rewatch it till last year!! It just goes to show how your mood can effect your enjoyment of a movie. I don't expect many here to have seen this movie, but I think it's wonderfully absorbing.

It is a flashback story, triggered by Streep's children sorting out her belongings years later when she has died, and we see just what this brief relationship meant to her.  The film lingers on the objects around the lead characters to put across the experience of their attraction to each other.What could have been preposterous works really well  the couple dance together in the kitchen, they go sight-seeing, they obviously get along. The story just about sweeps you along, even though you know it is silly, and it is nice to see Eastwood in a quieter role after all the shoot-fests he's famous for.

27,Dr_Coulardeau,Bridges may lead beyond cremation,10,28 November 2006,"A most surprising approach of mid-life love for a mother and wife, though seen by a male director apparently well supported or supplemented by some women in the team. What happens if for four days you are alone, but not abandoned, and meet a man that reveals to you that there can be some new love in your life even though this life of yours is satisfied, happy, well-balanced and characterized by no particular need nor want, nor even, as for that, wish, except maybe the desire to listen to and enjoy some classical music, some opera singing  and it could be anything at all  which is not appreciated by the other members of the family ? That is rather light as for discontentment or dissatisfaction. A short-lived love affair develops during and over these four days and you are confronted to the need to make a decision. The situation has already been considered by many and in many films. You break off and away and let yourself go with that love affair. Then later on you regret what you have lost in the process. Or you resist and do not yield and you regret all your life what you have not done. In both case you enjoy what you have taken or kept and you are divided between the two sides of your decision : does what I have taken or kept balance what I have rejected, refused or let go ? The film is thus not particularly innovative by its theme. Yet it has a special perfume, fragrance. What is it ? Certainly not the reaction of the children when they learn about it after your death. Their reactions are predictable and even superficial. The special value of this film is in fact in the two actors and the way they embody, with their body acting, the meeting of two potentials, the passion and the end of it, the loss of it and yet the survival of it. Apart from this marvelously well rendered flesh of the film the subject is banal. Meryl Streep particularly transcends her part and takes us into the deepest layers of her mind the way they ripple on her surface, on the surface of her body and behavior. We feel her disarray at first, her fascination then and her conservative sacrifice last in the most humane and subtle way. We are suffering and rejoicing with her and each side of her situation or decision has its lot of suffering and its lot of rejoicing. That's why this film should be kept in mind and remembered.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Bridges of Madison County
28,zkonedog,As Effective As It Is Simple,8,20 December 2018,"One of the joys of Clint Eastwood's oeuvre is that, besides his tough-guy cop or western roles, he has also been involved (acting, directing, or both) in a plethora of ""simple"" films. Not simple in the sense of ""bad"" or ""dumb"", mind you, but simple in that they don't really on a ton of other components besides a good story, solid characters, and terrific acting. Those three things are exactly what are featured in ""The Bridges of Madison County"".For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Francesca (Meryl Streep), an Iowa housewife--originally from Italy--who had/has big dreams in life but has ""settled"" for a husband and two children. On one rare occasion where she is left alone for a few days, photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) stumbles upon her farmstead looking for directions. What follows is a whirlwind romance in which both parties learn each other's deepest desires and must make tough decisions before ""the family"" returns home.Because ""Bridges"" is such a dialogue-heavy film, the characters have to be absolutely spot-on in terms of writing, and that's exactly what happens here. Truly the best scenes of the entire experience are Francesca & Robert just sitting at the dinner table talking to each other. Universal (and timeless) themes such as loneliness, entrapment, wanderlust, and passion are discussed, and thus there is something for nearly every viewer to identify with.Incredible acting is a ""must"" too, of course, to carry all that dialogue, and does it really get much better than Eastwood & Streep? While seemingly an odd fit for each other at first, they are both so good at their craft that it becomes easy to understand what is drawing these two characters together and the tornado of emotions the relationship produces.I also liked how the story is framed in a flashback reference, where Francesca's children are all discovering this for the first time themselves by reading their mother's old diaries. This framing mechanism lends even more importance to the ""chance encounter"" (especially at the beginning of the film), as viewers already know this will become a momentous period in Francesca's life.It would be easy for modern film-goers to discard or dismiss ""Bridges of Madison County"" as ""too slow"". To be honest, despite being a huge fan of Eastwood's work, it even took me a long time (and a specific recommendation) to get to this one. However, that was an enormous injustice to the story, acting, and direction present here. If you want to see how Eastwood honed his emotional-movie craft to later make masterpieces such as ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", or ""Changeling"", one could make a case that all starts with ""Bridges of Madison County"".",The Bridges of Madison County

Meryl Streep, on the other hand, is so annoying that it's impossible to understand why Clint would be attracted to her in the first place. I first saw this movie in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY).

She decides to relax, perhaps read a book, take things easy while her family is not there to keep her busy round the clock. But, things change when a photographer drives into town. One Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood).As much as I don't like this movie, I must at least admire what Eastwood has managed to achieve with it as its director, given the source material, which is basically just housewife literature, in the most derogatory meaning of the term. But with Eastwood at its helm, it transforms into something almost bearable. It is unhurried, yet never slow. The characters feel like actual three-dimensional people, and not just props meant to fuel our fantasies. The sets are nice, the dialogues feel natural and if only the story had even the slightest bit of substance, this could have been something. Plus both Eastwood and Streep are phenomenal actors.Alas, the story is garbage. I can see Eastwood trying to tell something about the loneliness of house wives, or the loneliness of a traveler. You can see his attempt to build passion where in the book there's only lust. But, the fact remains, that this is simply a movie about an affair. The movie tries to hang bells and other assorted decorations to hide the fact, but it fails. And it's dull to boot. You can guess exactly how the story will unfold from the very first scene, and even the pretentious framing story isn't enough to arouse our interest.The Bridges of Madison County has its upsides. And, honestly speaking, I will be the first one to admit that I'm about as far from this film's target audience as is possible. So my opinion should not count for that much.

Miss Streep is very beautiful(even more so near the end when she has aged realistically)but I found her transition from Italian=American earth-mother/cook/homemaker to flirty middle aged woman willing to risk everything for love decidedly unlikely. Equally Mr Eastwood's spartan independence is rather too quickly cast aside as he reverts to lovelorn adolesence in very short order. ""The bridges of Madison County"" was a very popular story and obviously somebody was going to make a movie of it.Because that task fell to Mr Eastwood what we have is about as good a movie as could have been made out of it.The faults lie in the original material.

Streep of course SHINES in her lead role as the unhappy, unsatisfied, unappreciated wife who meets Clint Eastwood while her husband is away and falls deeply in love. The performances given by Eastwood and Streep are two of the best acting performances I've ever seen in film. The accent, the frustration, the love, and the raw emotion is all captured unbelievably well by Meryl Streep. And Clint Eastwood tackles the drifter in love role well, it doesn't even seem like he's trying, it just feels so natural and real that it's hard to believe he's an actor playing a part. The chemistry is undeniably electric! Very natural romantic chemistry combined with their acting is really what makes this movie work so well. The writing is so well done too, it reaches out and grabs you, it really makes you feel like you're in the story. There are some movies that you feel they're excluding the audience, but this one really makes you feel so hard for these characters, it will matter to you what happens to them. I really liked the way they did two separate stories two, one in current day and the other in the past. Sort of reminded me of the notebook in a way. I love this film for the simple reason that it makes you feel things that just warms you up, you will feel good watching this. Now that doesn't mean that it's all butterflies and rainbows all throughout the film because it's not, it just means that the filmmakers do an impeccable job at making you care/feel for these people.

Too many of the quiet scenes are drawn out, lessening the emotional impact of Richard LaGravanese's screenplay. Still, everything else is very professional.Editing may be under done, but all other technical credits are superb, especially the cinematography, which captures picturesque Iowa with aplomb. Jack Niehaus provides a melodic score. All this is strongly supported by two expert showings from Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. The former does very well as the citizen of the world who may have finally found someone to love for life. Streep is at her best as the ex-patriot Italian whose routine life is turned on its head by this perfectly charming stranger.""The Bridges of Madison County"" is a movie for devotees of true romantic love stories, and for that audience this is a real treat.Tuesday, February 27, 1996 - Lorne Theatre",The Bridges of Madison County
38,EUyeshima,A Sublime Italianate Streep Towers Over a Snail's-Paced Romantic Tearjerker,6,1 August 2006,"If you want to see an actress make something out of nothing, then see Meryl Streep in this lumbering romance novel of a movie. Based on the ridiculous Robert James Waller bestseller (a book I truly loathed), the 1995 film retains a lot of the novel's unbearable treacle and heaving sentimentality. At the same time, screenwriter Richard LaGravenese's adaptation improves the story immeasurably by shifting more of the focus to Francesca Johnson, an Italian post-WWII bride who has become over the years, a lonely, middle-aged Iowa farmwife circa 1965. Her husband and two children leave for four days to the Illinois State Fair, and by chance, renowned photographer Robert Kincaid accidentally drops by the Johnson farm for directions to the famous Roseman Bridge, one of several covered bridges around Winterset, Iowa. Francesca is fascinated, then smitten, and the two embark on a brief but life-altering love affair.It's fortunate that Clint Eastwood chose to direct this film, as it takes his professional certainty and laconic storytelling style to make this vehicle work. Without sacrificing much of his natural machismo, he's also quite effectively enigmatic as Kincaid, though I think he's at least a decade too old for the part. Whether wringing her hands in anticipation or quietly crying in her mud room, Streep, affecting one of her world-class accents, is at the top of her game yet again. The film's best moments are hers in the rain-soaked scene of inevitability toward the end, when the drama is guided mainly by her mastery of the character's alternating waves of regret and longing. What doesn't work at all is the use of a framing device in having the now-grown Johnson children read their mother's love letters about her romance with Kincaid. It doesn't help that Annie Corley and Victor Slezak play these parts as if they are cast in a sitcom. On the plus side, Jack N. Green's cinematography lovingly captures Iowa's bucolic landscapes. But there is no getting around the slowness of the action, which feels interminable at 135 minutes. The DVD came out just two years after in 1997 and consequently has none of the extras we have come to expect from more recent releases.",The Bridges of Madison County
39,Boyo-2,Clint get warm & fuzzy,7,10 July 2000,"I was surprised by several elements of the movie - Clint directs with more sensitivity than I would have thought possible and his own portrayal of Robert is very good also.  I admire Meryl Streep more than any other actor and she is very good in this, too.  You can feel the sexual tension between the actors and that is when the movie is at its best - the little moments when dialogue is at a minimum but there is a lot going on. It was also nice to see a couple of approximately the same age, and also nice that Meryl's husband wasn't made out to be this total jerk, thereby giving a segment of the audience the reason to understand why she is having an affair. Sometimes things just happen between people and that's what I got out of this movie.",The Bridges of Madison County
40,ShootingShark,Solid Adaptation Of Best-Selling Romantic Novel,5,2 May 2005,"Whilst her family are away, a frustrated housewife in Iowa befriends a touring National Geographic photographer and they have an intensely passionate four-day affair. But when her family are due to return, there are tough choices to be made.Based on the popular novel by Robert James Waller, this is a thoughtful, sensuous, poignant and bittersweet love story. It's really just a two-character drama, with fine performances by the unlikely pairing of Streep and Eastwood. He's the person she'd like to be - a free spirit with nothing to tie him down - but ultimately her love and respect for her family and her sense of obligation to them win out. It's a movie about the heroism and work-ethic of motherhood and how much women sacrifice to care for their families, and it makes its point with great subtlety and insight. A very well-crafted film, with a powerful score by Lennie Niehaus and brilliant editing by Joel Cox. The key to developing character and drama with this type of story is to carefully control the editing to give the performances centre-stage, and this is a textbook example of such judicious pacing. Eastwood's son Kyle has a cameo as a bass player in a nightclub. Shot in the real Madison County, Iowa, on beautifully picturesque locations.",The Bridges of Madison County
41,Amyth47,SPELLBINDING ROMANCE DRAMA.,8,19 January 2019,"My Rating : 8/10If you've ever been in love you will certainly enjoy and understand this little gem. Produced and directed by Clint Eastwood 'The Bridges of Madison County' explores themes of forbidden love, in this case extramarital affair with an intensity and passion that's pure magic. This is how affairs and flings happen in real life, due to human weakness. I would rather see this kind of a movie than when people act larger than life.Wonderful performances from Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, breathtaking chemistry and an absolute treat from beginning to finish.I highly, highly recommend it if you're reading this.",The Bridges of Madison County
42,bobbysing,Sheer poetry on the celluloid unexpectedly from Clint Eastwood,9,24 January 2008,"It was really surprising to see this sheer poetry on the celluloid coming from a person who is known more for his action and cowboy image, that's Clint Eastwood. This is his emotional and sensitive movie which forces us to think about whether we are enjoying our lives being where we are, or we still regret the decision we made in our lives. I was completely spellbound as the end credits rolled and really enjoyed every minute of this movie till its last scene. The story is about four days in the life of a happily married lady, which she lived with a complete stranger. She cherishes and remembers those four days till her last breath and leaves her diaries with all her confessions for her two grown up children to read. Meryl Streep is superb and lovable as the lady and Clint Eastwood himself plays the role of the photographer who accidentally comes in her life. The movie has some emotionally written scenes which have a spiritual value. The dialogues make you look inside your own life and question your own existence and its worth. The unsaid conversations between Meryl and her husband, who know everything are filmed in the most impressive way. The best part is that as the children read their mother's diaries, at first the boy feels disgusting reading it, but then understands the feelings of her mother who was also a loving women from inside. And its even more beautiful that at the end they both don't feel any guilt for their mother but feel proud at her innocence and truthfulness. Mahesh Manjrekar made ""Astitva"" in Hindi, inspired from this movie, but changed the sensitive topic into a tense drama which becomes cunning and sarcastic in the end. He kept the character of the lady alive to face all the hardships after her confession. Whereas the original movie is lovable till the last scene,the Hindi version has only one saving grace ""Tabu"" who has acted brilliantly. For many reasons, still ""Meryl Streep"" is more believable in her impactful act. She is just adorable in the scenes which show her inner conflicts. Along with ""Clint Eastwood"" they both look like real life lovers and talk through their eyes.This is a poetic expression on screen straight from heart, not to be missed, even if you have seen ""Astitva"" or not.",The Bridges of Madison County
43,philip_vanderveken,Too bad that this movie has one weakness,9,18 May 2005,"""The Bridges of Madison County"", that title on its own is already enough to scare half of the male population away. They know it's a romantic drama and don't even need to see it, they are already convinced that they won't like it. And yet, if only they took the time to give it a try, they might be surprised by it. I know I was, so why shouldn't others have the same feelings about it.The movie tells the story of the National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) and the housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) whose paths cross in the sixties. While her husband and children are away at the Iowa state fair in the summer of 1965, Kincaid asks Francesca for directions to the Rosamunde Bridge. He tells her that he's in the region to photograph the bridges for his famous employer. She agrees to show him to the bridges and that's how their four day romance starts. After these four days, Kincaid leaves and Francesca is left behind with her mixed feelings of grieve for a lost love and happiness for her family that has returned. Not able to tell anybody what has happened to her, she has written it all down in a diary that now, after her death has been found by her children. In that diary she asks them not to bury her next to her deceased husband, but to scatter her cremated remains off Rosamunde Bridge, just like happened with Kincaid, after he died...With this movie Clint Eastwood proves to be a good director who is able to do a lot more than to act in Westerns. In fact, this should have been his second masterpiece (Unforgiven was his first one, no doubt about that), but in my opinion he made one small, but fatal mistake. The fact that he keeps returning to Francesca's adult children reading the diary, takes away a lot of the magic. If they had only been in the movie in the beginning and at the end, it would have been a lot better, because they aren't the real stars of this movie. The only real stars are Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, who both did an excellent job in this movie. Their acting feels so natural that it almost is like they aren't acting at all. The chemistry between the two is unbelievable and pure. I've rarely seen such beautiful moments of passion in a Hollywood production and I certainly didn't expect to get it from Clint Eastwood.Overall this movie is a pleasant surprise. Normally I'm not a great fan of romantic drama's but I will never reject a movie, just because it belongs to a certain genre either. It felt real without being all too sentimental, it was moving without being corny. This is really a very nice movie that everybody should give a try. I'm sure many will say it isn't good, just because there aren't any car chases or big explosions in it, but for all those who are looking for an adult love story, this is definitely worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10.",The Bridges of Madison County

48,SmileysWorld,"By golly,Clint can act!",8,23 June 2002,"I have always felt that there was a difference between actors and movie stars.Actors take their craft seriously and work hard to become the characters they portray,while movie stars draw high numbers at the box office with their name alone.It's not hard to distinguish who these people are.However,in the case of Clint Eastwood,I have never really known which of the two categories to place him in.We have all of the ""Dirty Harry"" type shoot-em-ups and the ""The Man with no Name"" westerns that would place him in the movie star category,and then we have films such as this one,in which Clint proves to us that he can,indeed,act. Clint can be a romantic lead and compete with the best in that area.I love this film for it's rural settings,Eastwood's direction,and his marvelous acting performance along with Meryl Streep's.Adultery is indeed a touchy subject with me.Being raised with certain values,I can't help but detest the mere subject,but in the case of this particular film it is so well done you almost have to overlook it just this once.This movie is a well done potential classic.One of Clint's best from the standpoints of both acting and directing.",The Bridges of Madison County
49,nicholas.rhodes,Highly Romantic,7,3 May 2003,"Before sitting down to watch this film, you need the following equipment : a comfy armchair, a HUGE bucket to collect all your tears and a big Bath Towel to wipe your eyes ! This has to be one of the most romantic and sad films made for decades, at least since the 1940's and 1950's. Not only is it highly romantic, but the underlying eroticism will have you in a state long before the middle of the film.To start with, when the film begins, all its protagonists are already dead..... Eastwood, Streep and Streep's husband. This is already tear-provoking in itself. The film is therefore presented as a series of flashbacks in conjunction with Streep's childrens' reading of her diaries.The whole thing is very thoughtfully done, picture quality is excellent, the sets and lighting are magnificent. Streep's innocence ( ""What is this passion that's invading me ???"" )is extremely beautiful and natural. Eastwood plays it sober but with just the amount of passion to keep the spectator's heart pounding sufficiently quickly !!Even if you are against infidelity, it's difficult NOT to want these two to make out so to speak, as you can feel the passion ""boiling up below the skin's surface"" ( excuse the culinary imagery please !! )The tears really start to gush during the scene in the rain when Streep and her husband are behind Eastwood in his truck at the traffic lights -the waiting seems endless and the spectator can feel the frustration Streep is undergoing through this scene. We see Eastwood's truck turn off to the left and .......... oh ! its difficult to describe it !The final scene where the ashes are tossed into the river is of course heart-tearing and we see how Streep's children reflect on their own personal lives in the light of what they read in her diaries.It's very difficult to put into words the emotion felt on watching this film, so I'll stop here but would recommend this as one of the most romantic films of the last century which will be a source of inspiration to future generations.",The Bridges of Madison County
50,RJBurke1942,Love is where the heart is  or is it?,7,13 January 2008,"Apparently this film did well internationally  nominated and/or winning Best Foreign Film in six countries  but failed to win any Oscar in USA.It's a well produced and directed film  as you might expect from Clint Eastwood  showing fine detail for the 1965 settings, great casting (although you can argue whether Eastwood miscast himself as the romantic lead), lush cinematography in rural Iowa, and period mood music that hit the spots...Despite the fact that I generally avoid romances  in fact I deliberately waited all this time before seeing and reviewing it  I found myself liking it very much. In the first place, I much admire Meryl Streep (as Francesca Johnson) who, once again, shows her mastery of acting, period. Her ability to say much more than enough without using words is simply astounding. In contrast, although Eastwood does a credible job, his efforts fall short; adequate, but only near the closing scenes, does he show the real agony his character, Robert Kincaid, must feel while standing in the rain.Sure, this is a tearjerker for many. However, if you can control your emotions for a little while, you'll more easily see that this is a story that confronts the nature of human love as never before, I think. The central question is undeniable: does true love between two people ever truly exist? It's what the two lovers do eventually, however, that puts this story onto a higher philosophical plane  and thus provides hope for Francesca's children when they learn of her affair after her death (that's no spoiler  the whole story begins with the reading of her will).The supporting cast typifies the people of the area: rough, inbred, literally down-to-earth, rural people who form the backbone of America  thus making Kincaid's presence all the more attractive to Johnson, as she digs the dirt and shoots the s*** with the local women. Streep just falls into the role, even down to the blunt and dirty finger tips...I don't know of any other outright romance that Eastwood has made or in which he has appeared. So, for those reasons alone, it was worth seeing from my perspective  apart from the stunning performance by Streep, arguably one of the few women who could have taken on this part.Recommended for all.",The Bridges of Madison County
51,sashank_kini-1,"Decent film worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep, albeit one's willing to endure the contrived writing, middling supporting performances & weak framing device",6,31 May 2013,"""Robert, I want you to come"" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years.This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody.A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big' – it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clichéd material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber – the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes ""This must be Robert Kincaid"" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye.Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.",The Bridges of Madison County

53,diane-34,A very endearing love fantasy,10,5 March 2011,"Last night Diane and I watched this movie about which we had heard much comment but had not seen it until it came on late night TV. Both of us enjoyed the film greatly and thought that all the elements that make an enjoyable and memorable film came together. I love reading Viewer Comments, depending on the film, before writing my own and please forgive me here; some of them are downright bizarre. Movies are fantasy, even if they want to be factual so treat them as fantasy. I do not think that you should bring out your Bible and begin to thump it because you are there to protect the morals of your kids or as Christians love doing, protecting us, the Great Unwashed Masses, from ourselves. We will succeed in arriving somewhere without the help of the silly churches dotting the land like pimples on the earth's behind. This was a fantasy examination of what is and what might have been. Eastwood and Streep play their roles seamlessly; Eastwood's direction married to Steep's always sensitive acting is superb. I loved Streep's virtually flawless facial expressions mirroring her interior emotions throughout the film. I was not bothered by her accent or how other commentators saw it, her lack of an accent. The film's ending was hard; Francesca had decisions to make, she made them and must spend her remaining years recounting those decisions, as do all of us whether in career, or love or virtually anything in life. It is the old story of the Fork in the Road and the path taken.

55,roghache,Beautiful scenery does not make a beautiful romance,2,30 June 2009,"While I don't condone infidelity, affairs can make for great cinema. However, not in this movie despite featuring two stars, Meryl Steep and Clint Eastwood, whose talents are wasted here. Streep's at times compelling performance is expended on a film which manipulates viewer emotions so they don't see this affair for what it is. It shouldn't be considered a great love story just because it's the wife who is cheating on the husband, not the reverse. It is not poignant, sensitive, and romantic (as often described) but instead involves boredom, lust, and naive schoolgirl thinking far more than genuine love. Yes, it does have wonderful cinematography but viewers shouldn't confuse the beauty of the Iowa scenery as indicating that this illicit relationship was in any way beautiful. When you get past the acting and the scenery...Here we have a housewife, Francesca, longing to travel and bored with her faithful, hard working, and decent but dull farmer husband and unexciting country life. While her husband is off at the State Fair with their teenage children, she has an affair with a stranger who chances her way, a ruggedly handsome, world traveling photographer named Robert. She foolishly concludes, after a few conversations and sexual encounters (some of which occur in the marital bed she shares with her husband, not exactly endearing), that her new man, a charismatic wanderer, is her true love. Of course her husband 'doesn't understand her' but her lover, who has known her for a few days, is her soul mate who understands her completely. (Would viewers be as sympathetic to a man whose wife didn't understand him, who had an affair because he suddenly found his soul mate and contemplated leaving his family so he could go off with his lover to follow his dreams???) From the onset Francesca is miserable living in a house in the middle of nowhere but she has only herself to blame. Wasn't she aware when she married him that her husband was a farmer, that they would be living in the country?? There would have been hobbies and interests she could have pursued, even living in the country, where she might have found some degree of fulfillment and which wouldn't have upset her husband, especially given that her children were getting older all the time so likely to permit her more freedom. Francesca should have discussed her needs, wants, and dreams WITH HER HUSBAND! Admittedly he wasn't exactly sensitive but neither did he appear to be a monster who would have cared nothing about his wife's unhappiness, had she made him aware of the full extent of it. She never really made much effort to open her heart up to him. While she did remain with her family, playing the self sacrificing martyr and suffering for years in silence are not admirable, IMO. She stoically 'did her duty' but never attempted to make anything better of her marriage.Who is to say that if she had gone off with Robert, he wouldn't have dumped her when she started to bore him? Having one failed marriage behind him and a history of reluctance to commit, he didn't come across to me as a very promising life partner. If Robert had really loved Francesca, he would have thought of her best interests instead of selfishly encouraging her to abandon her children. The dancing scene where they end up in bed comes across as a cliché seduction, nothing original or memorable. The truck scene in the rain is supposedly so moving but how can anyone sympathize with a woman even considering leaving her teenage children for her lover of four days? Unwisely, Francesca chooses to write a tell-all journal about the affair to be read by her adult children after her death, requesting that her ashes be scattered off a particular covered bridge to join her lover's ashes. I found this neither romantic nor touching but selfish and pointless, serving only to upset and potentially hurt her adult children. If she and Robert genuinely had this great love, surely it wouldn't have required some grand romantic mingling of their ashes off that bridge to prove it. Of course these children, a rather uninspiring pair who contributed nothing positive to this movie, quickly become understanding and are not (as would be more believable) devastated about their mother's infidelity and especially learning that their father wasn't her true love. In fact, we're to believe this revelation actually helped them sort out their own romantic messes. The modern Hollywood message, I guess.Had she not chosen to risk hurting her children with her after-death revelations, I might have felt some sympathy for Francesca wasting so much of her life based on four days of the romantic, exciting, passionate early phase of a new relationship, foolishly pining for a man who likely would have brought her unhappiness even if she had been free.Those who want a truly moving film about an affair should watch the 1945 Brief Encounter. It has class. Much the same idea -- bored middle-aged housewife has short term liaison with exciting new man but unlike this film, the wife realizes what she does have in her husband and, contrary to the cliché about not being understood, relates her tale as though addressing her husband, the only person in the world who would understand. It perfectly contrasts committed married love versus the excitement of a new romance. And its heroine, a very sympathetic character, would NEVER have deliberately hurt her adult children for such a pointless whim as the ashes. Alas, Bridges is no Brief Encounter.",The Bridges of Madison County

There was an insert  in National Geographic saying that they never had a photographer by that name and they never published an article about the bridges of Madison County.

There are scenes where it is difficult not to cry. The scene where Kincaid comes back and it is really rainy. They see each other, she begins to cry and her husband is so oblivious that it takes forever for him to notice that she is crying. She grabs the door handle of the car, but she cannot go. It is an asphyxiating scene.  Another touching scene:  she has grey  hair and her husband  is old and sick and he tells her ""I  knew you had dreams but I could not make them come true."" 	 	The story telling is terrific as well as the photography.  I love how the story is told by her kids, and how they go through their mother's  things and how that affected their lives. She tells them that ""As one gets older ones fear subsidizes.""  True! There are movies about the same topic but the audience is made to pass judgment, but in this one it is tough to judge. The characters are so lovable and sincere.  	 	The ambiguity of  the situation leave the audience torn between love, right and wrong and makes the audiences reflect in their own lives. It is a gem of a movie! 	 	The entire romance was a serious thing for both of them and throughout the rest of their lives they never forgot each other.  I just love this movie!",The Bridges of Madison County
57,Herag,Immoral and creepy movie,4,3 April 2010,"Clint Eastwood was, and is, a lousy actor. The old actors don't just fade away-they become directors-and lousy directors at that. Clint was good during ""Spaghetti Western"" days when he had the least amount of spoken word and smoked reefers like no other cowboy could. Give him a dialog-he fumbles and mumbles. The screen writing is the worst. The flashbacks and the letter reading by the brother and sister team is just annoying and boring. Here is a guy from nowhere and has a fling with a married woman. Apparently he has been doing this all over the world including Bari-Itlay, India and wherever he can land himself for a Bed (read-sex) and breakfast. Unless confronted by the wives or killed by the husbands he even manages to publish few nude photos in the National Geographic. The movie is not ""On Golden Pond"" and these two are not Hepburn and Tracey either. Merryl Streep drifts from her Italian accent (she is the only one who has acted in this movie) to Iowa accent when not cooking country sausage for this ""handy husband of three days.' A good porno movie has more entertainment value than this flick. This is an overrated movie that I had the unfortunate displeasure of seeing. I'm not the only one-one out of four thinks this movie stinks. Clint is overrated as a director and underrated as a Mayor of Carmel!",The Bridges of Madison County
58,OldAle1,Once in every life....someone comes along,10,25 July 2009,"Closeup on a mailbox: Mr. and Mrs. Richard Johnson. Behind it, a dusty road leading through green fields, a minivan coming towards the camera and a pan over towards an isolated farmhouse. It's the present, and Michael and Carolyn have come to settle some issues regarding their mother's estate. It seems that their mother wanted her ashes scattered from a nearby covered bridge, which startles her two grown kids, particularly the seemingly very conservative and religious Michael. Turns out that Francesca had her reasons, as they find out when they open her cedar chest and turn to the diaries contained within...Late summer 1965, and Francesca, an Iowa housewife in her mid-40s is seeing her husband and kids off to the Illinois State Fair. They'll be gone for 5 days and she'll have little to do but be bored in a different way than she usually is, until the arrival the next morning of a lost National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Kincaid is on assignment to photograph the covered bridges that the county is famed for, and Francesca tries to tell him the way to the Roseman bridge but quickly decides to show him the way personally instead. As they drive towards the bridge and make small talk, they seem uneasy at first - but when Robert mentions Francesca's accent, and she finds that he has visited the town where she grew up in Italy, something starts to click. He reaches for a cigarette from the glove compartment and brushes her leg...later he picks flowers for her....they have the same favorite radio station, playing blues and jazz. Francesca starts to see something special, exotic....Robert sees someone warm and real, centered but more than the simple housewife that she's let herself become.So begins four days of falling in love, four days of uncertainty, secretive glances, shyness turning to boldness, feelings long-buried in both reawakened and examined by two people smart enough to know right away how problematic an affair can be, yet willing to cast aside the doubts and damn the consequences. For now. The brilliance of The Bridges of Madison County isn't in any kind of originality, and it isn't in the bits of Waller's strained prose that occasionally leech through LaGravenese's generally excellent screenplay; it isn't in Streep's accent, which I know some have problems with but which I barely even notice at this point; and it isn't in the framing story, which again has grown on me over time but is certainly not all that interesting itself. What makes the film magical is the chemistry, the feeling of absolute rightness between the two leads, and the slow building towards an inevitable yet still heartbreaking decision.Clint Eastwood certainly must have seemed an odd choice to take on this film, which he co-produced and co-wrote the elegiac ""Doe Eyes"" theme for in addition to directing and starring - even to me, a big fan already at the time, it seemed odd. Robert Redford seemed to be everybody's idea of Kincaid, and Steven Spielberg got mentioned often as a possible director, but I doubt many people will have problems after they see the film. Eastwood's Robert is a sensitive guy, but he's not schmaltzy, a poetic man but not pretentious about it, and a man clearly as unsure about the concept of love and the kind of risk he puts himself into as the married Francesca. He's a traveler and a loner, but deep down there's something missing, something we can feel almost from the beginning, something seen in the long gaze out the window near the end, and as he stands in the rain, waiting and hoping, at the film's emotional climax. And Eastwood the director keeps things from getting out of hand sentimentally until the last half hour, when both he and the audience know it's time for the tears to flow.But as good as Clint is - and this is surely one of his two or three best performances - Meryl Streep is just a marvel here. Overlook the accent - whether you like it or not, it really isn't terribly important here - and you see a less mannered, more natural performance than she's given anywhere else. She mentions a couple of times in the making-of piece that accompanies the film on DVD that she was uncertain at first of Eastwood's quick shooting style, but it does wonders for her, giving a spontaneity that she really needed for the role. So much of the film relies on us believing that these are two hesitant, uncertain people with a yearning that at first has no direction - it can't seem studied, and it doesn't. And for a film that is set mostly in a kitchen and around barn-like red covered bridges, there's an excitement and intensity that can't be matched in most romances shot under the Eiffel Tower or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. The technical aspects - Jack N. Green's lovely September-October photography and the wonderful Eastwood-chosen musical mixture of Johnny Hartman and Dinah Washington, among others - are just about perfect as well.What the film ultimately builds to - and much of it is on Streep's shoulders - is a powerful examination of regret and loss and a determination that there are no perfect choices in life, only choices that involve different kinds of sacrifices. The film doesn't comment on the rightness or wrongness of her adultery, but Francesca lets her kids know that whatever she's done, she's not going to beat herself up over it - and neither should they. At the end, we know that whatever choice she made would have been difficult, would have involved hurting herself and others; there's no easy answer, only a bit of hope for the next generation, as they at least have come to accept and understand, and Francesca's ashes scatter on the wind....",The Bridges of Madison County

60,fimimix,..didn't enjoy it at all..,5,19 August 2007,"I am a big slob for love-romances, but I must admit I was surfing the web while KCET presented this film.I am a huge fan of Meryl Streep (""Francesca Johnson"") and can tolerate Clint Eastwood (""Robert Kincaid""). Infidelity happens every second in marriage, and the trailer certainly lets you know IMMEDIATELY this is a love-affair between the two leading stars. Please give me some d.r.a.m.a. with love-affairs. Humdrum is every day......I suppose the point that I didn't get excited over is how the ""kids"" became adjusted to their mother (Streep) wanting to be cremated and her ashes scattered off a bridge. Cremation is an every-day affair, now. And, this story reversed the passion in the family: remember how large farm-families used to be? Farmers were hardly ever too tired to make babies. That ""Mom"" was the horny one should shock no one, if ""Dad"" weren't romantic enough to quench ""Mom's"" roving eye. Most moms are clever enough to realize four days aren't going to erase many years of sacrifice and love.....she made ""the right"" decision, because she knew she was where she belonged.I shed tears even for happy and beautiful movies - ""Bridges"" didn't open the spigot for me. Maybe I'll give it look-see at a later date, but right now I wouldn't dash out and purchase a DVD. ""STARZ"" showed it every day for a week ? Wow ! I like to watch movies I love many times, but that's a bit much for me. I guess I would have loved all that cinemascope landscape and beautiful colors - some of the songs in the score I really love. I also feel great acting can be done in a very simple story, but I didn't find it here. Glad all you guys liked it - I AM one to feel love comes at first-sight - and it can also grow on you - but, ""Bridges of Madison County"" just didn't turn me on.

61,Catharina_Sweden,An engaging movie that is still morally wrong,8,1 April 2014,"This is a very good movie - no one can honestly say anything else. It has everything: an engaging story, romance, passion, moral issues, believable characters, a good picture of the time period, excellent actors, beautiful scenery, etc.. Still, I do not fall head over heals over it in the way I did when I watched it at the pictures when it was new - 19 years ago. The movie has not changed, of course, but I have. I am older, more mature, and have more life experience - including a marriage, two children and a divorce.I can now see the story from the other side. Suppose, that I went away with the children for a few days, in an errand that was fun and good for the whole family. During this brief time, my husband should enter into a relation with a woman whom he considered much more exciting than me. More beautiful, with a more interesting background and profession, and a more exciting life-style... And the reason that I would be less exciting, would be that I - who maybe also had other dreams as a young girl - have given all I have for the good of our family...That would not feel very nice. Also, it would not feel very nice, if he died first, to find out that he has treasured a lot of mementos from this short affair. Without realizing, that the romance would soon have passed and the woman taken on ordinary proportions, if they had lived together in an everyday reality for some time.Basically, I think it is morally wrong to make a movie like this. It gives people the wrong ideas, inspires them to seek illicit love affairs and dampens their conscience, and can even cause family tragedies. Still, it is very good as escapism, if you keep in mind that that is what it is, and that it cannot happen in reality.",The Bridges of Madison County
62,David_del_Real_Reviews_in_IMDb,A great movie that builds up slow to shape a touching love story.,10,29 September 2017,"Note: Most of my reviews contain some spoilers, but I always try that none of them can actually ""spoil"" any important surprise during the story, so you can read without worrying.First of all I need to clarify mi title a little, when I say ""that builds up slow"" I don't mean like saying ""even when it begins boring"" or anything alike. The whole movie is completely enjoyable. What I mean by this, is that the creators took the time to introduce the characters to us without hurry, which helps us to become more involved with them later.IMDb suggests to its reviewers to compare titles with similar ones. In this aspect I want to say that I think (as many persons do) that this is one of the best romantic dramas of all time. I want to say too that it is both my favorite Meryl Streep and my favorite Clint Eastwood movie so far. IMDb also suggest reviewers to recommend similar titles to their readers; in that sense my second favorite Meryl Streep movie is ""Kramer vs Kramer"" and my second favorite Clint Eastwood movie is ""Gran Torino"" and I am not sure if the third one is ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""The Unforgiven"". Sorry, I still have no idea about which is my third favorite Meryl Streep movie, too many movies too different from each other to choose from.OK, about THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. Maybe its beauty comes from making an extraordinary love story happen to ""almost"" ordinary people. He is a photographer for National Geographic and she is and Italian immigrant born in Bari that lives in the county of Madison, in Iowa, USA. She is home alone while her family is away and he happens to arrive to her town to take pictures of the great bridges and landscapes. The story is actually told by the sons of Francesca (the Meryl Streep's character) when they find a letter let for them by her telling them their story. Its a narrative arc that makes you wonder how much people maybe YOU have met in life without really knowing them and their motivations for living. At the moment of making this review, The bridges of Madison County is not included in the IMDb top 100 greatest movies of all time but I really believe it deserves a place there.Thanks for reading.IMDb Review by David del Real.

63,JoshtheGiant,Meryl Streep is amazing,5,14 March 2006,The Bridges of Madison County has two stellar leading performances by none other than the great Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood. It is directed by the great Clint Eastwood and has very strong story. It sounds like the perfect film huh. Well it ends up being far from perfect. This comes out of many things. Namely the ending which is clichéd and overly sentimental. There are also many scenes that seem very forced and fake. The performances help but come far from saving it. The parts with Meryl Streeps characters children who are reading the notes she left after she died. Even if those parts are better than the rest of the film they still seem very forced.

66,PCC0921,Eastwood Does a Great Job,9,15 January 2021,"Based on the book of the same name, this romantic drama begins at the present time, when the son and daughter of Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), come home to Madison County, Iowa, to bury their mother. They learn that in 1965 their mother had a four day love affair, with National Geographic Photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood). They find their mother's three volume journal that she wrote shortly after the affair. The journal explains the affair, the reason for her actions, and the way she still felt for them and their father. The journal begins at the point when the father and the children go away on an excursion and, during that time she meets Kincaid. It also talks about the 25 years since then, and if the two ever kept in touch.The film is very melodic in its approach towards the two main characters and the act of committing adultery. You find yourself thinking about the delicate nature of love and betrayal. Is it wrong or is it right? You are as confused as the two lovers are and that is what Eastwood wanted to do. Eastwood's directing is very good. Streep's portrayal is fantastic. Eastwood did it again. As he did in Unforgiven (1990). His directing was very good, but his acting is a little distant from the audience and I saw a few editing mistakes.My final word on this film however is, it is very good. It is something that most people of the nineties should see. It approaches a problem that is widespread today and takes that problem into a confused dream-scape world and tries to correct the mistakes that many human beings have made. The film is love all the way, without glorifying the act of adultery. The message is clear and I only hope that some people do not see this as an excuse to cheat on a loved one.9.2 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB",The Bridges of Madison County

69,zfiany,A romantic masterpiece that says it all!,8,16 October 2009,"The movie is so brilliantly made to deliver the message of what you want versus what you should do. I guess this role wasn't difficult to Streep in its essence as she played it already with Robert Deniro in Falling in Love but there was a challenge in this role and it is unfair not to be able to see it as a viewer! The challenge was for Meryle who is in her 40s to act as the teenage who fell in love and found the passion that she had never felt before in such an age and still be lovable to the conservative viewer. I, for one, loved her so much and wasn't intimidated by anything in the way she acted. I was totally compassionate with the character and I have to say that many of the comments didn't quite understand the character. It all lies in the scene where she says to Eastwood that she hoped she didn't bore him with her stupid chatting and he replies back that he could never think of her that way and that she was a smart woman. It's at the moment that she falls in love with him because she had lost her wit in the simple life of the simple man she got married. Just amazing! The story talks about the kind of love that you find once in your life with only one person who can get out the real you and make you feel your importance which life tends to bury down with its different loads.The movie had so many deep and beautiful scenes, particularly the scene where Francesca is in the car with her husband and Eastwood is in his right behind them hanging the necklace on the mirror as a sign for her to leave the car and runaway with him just like teenagers in love would do. Waw, this movie never stops to amaze me with all the details in it. Both characters never knew what love is and they found it together but not at the right time.There is also the scene where her husband is dying and he asks her if he ever did her wrong and she smiles knowing that she had taken the right choice by staying with her family. That's when duty calls and love no matter how big it is fails to surpass doing what's right.And believe me there is so much more to the movie and no matter how much has been said in the reviews, there is still more.",The Bridges of Madison County

74,dalton2,A modern Casablanca,9,10 September 2000,"This film portrays a beautiful love story with which we get fascinated if we want so. If we forget that this is just another story, with different characters, different situations, a different time and made in 1995 instead of 1940, we could even say that it's a modern Casablanca. The main elements are there: An impossible love, lovers took apart by almost irresistible forces, and several common scenes: The rain scene, the appearance of Eastwood in the rain (similar to the appearance of Ingrid Bergman at Rick's cafe in the night)... In Casablanca they always would have Paris, in The Bridges of Madison County they always would have Iowa...Thus, in my opinion, this film borrows several elements from Casablanca, but not to copy them, but to incorporate them into a different story.This film is beautiful. Eastwood and Streep are near perfect, to the point that we forget their physical appearances to reach their feelings. We are able to see the inner beauty they have found in each other and get captivated by the atmosphere. There is a fantastic use of light which fits perfectly with every situation, and the music is quite good.When the film finishes, you find yourself in deep melancholy. My conclusion is that Clint Eastwood is better director than actor, I guess.My rating is 9 out of 10.",The Bridges of Madison County

That little tidbit might scare away some male viewers, but let me assure it's not a sappy love story. Even my husband thought this was a ""really good movie."" We are absorbed by these two characters and feel their chemistry almost immediately. By the time we remember that there's a family out there to consider, it's too late. We're dug in deep and feel the pain of having to choose between what's always been and what could be. And it's a powerful moment when that choice is finally made",The Bridges of Madison County
76,writerasfilmcritic,A Sweet and Poignant Love Story,8,18 February 2010,"An Iowa farmer's lonely Italian wife, left at home for four days while he and the children are off at the Illinois State Fair, has a torrid romance with an adventurous, globe-trotting photographer. Although he reawakens her physically and emotionally, she doesn't really believe it's true love until it is too late. What she does believe is that she has a duty to family (""the little details of her life"") that eclipses her right to real happiness.One year, we went through Winterset, where the story is set, and found it to be a rather strange place. The rolling Iowa countryside, with its lush vegetation, vast, often stormy skies, and enchanting, white gravel roads, has a special charm, to be sure. But much of the state is nearly flat and it is often bleak and depressing, the unpleasant odor emanating from penned hogs and feedlots often hanging heavily in the air. And Iowans struck us as a very provincial lot -- suspicious, very nosy, and at times downright weird. In fact, some of them looked overly inbred, even potentially dangerous. The movie, to its credit, captured the essence of all that quite well. Francesca deserved more than to spend the rest of her life in such a place, and she owed it to Robert, the photographer, if to no one else. Tossing their ashes off the same bridge was a symbolic gesture, at best, and I'm afraid it was a poor substitute for the few short years they might have enjoyed together instead of just four short days in each other's arms. Even after her husband died, Francesca made only a token effort to contact Robert. While I understood her decision to stay with her family, fearing that her love for him could not last if she ran away with him and that she'd blame him for a growing sense of guilt, once her kids were gone and both she and her husband were getting older, I think she should have found him again, if only to reunite temporarily, rather than going to their respective graves never having known what might have happened. Clint Eastwood, the director, was trying to make a realistic ending, but I felt a little let down by it.That said, the love story was sweet and poignant, certain of the love scenes rather erotic, and other sequences quite moving. I particularly liked the couple's interaction on the second day, after Francesca left the note for Robert and they were hesitantly circling one another, both desperately wanting to make love. Then, the scene in the kitchen, where Francesca blew up and called Robert a shallow phony, I thought was very effective. Finally, we had the climax, where Robert stood in the rain, looking pathetic but sincere, then at the stoplight, he held up traffic for another moment, hoping Francesca would change her mind. She almost did, too, but simply couldn't tear herself away from her husband in time. To his alarm and concern, she broke down in tears as Robert turned left and rolled out of her life, forever. That was some good cinema. At the conclusion of the film, we see an encompassing view of the tidy, productive little farm where Francesca spent her life, giving everything else up to remain there. Did she make the right decision? The scenes where her grown children read her notebooks after her death, trying to understand her final wishes, could have been somewhat better but did not, to an excessive degree, detract from this otherwise excellent effort. In particular, Meryl Streep as Francesca was especially good.",The Bridges of Madison County
77,jhsteel,Life is complicated,9,10 February 2009,"This is like Brief Encounter and Casablanca in that it evokes the agony of having to make choices based upon what you think will make your life bearable, at the expense of losing something wonderful, that then becomes a treasured memory. I'm sure many people have had similar experiences in their lives, maybe not as intense as the one experienced by Francesca and Robert in this film. I agree that the performances were impeccable and the limited sets made the viewer focus on the relationship that was central to the plot. It's a very intense portrayal of a very real emotional dilemma, and I empathised with Francesca's difficult choice. I do think she chose wisely but in a way it was a no-win situation for her. Time does heal and make that pain bearable, and maybe it did for her.It was obvious to me that she chose to become closer to Robert - she invited him into her life, and then she realised the impact of what she had done. It is a cautionary tale in some ways as well - I'm sure a lot of people in that situation would have denied themselves that opportunity. Meryl Streep's performance conveyed every aspect of what her character felt, without words in many cases. Clint Eastwood was also excellent but i couldn't help wishing he had been a bit younger. I don't know how old the characters were in the book.This is one of the few movies that tears my heart out each time I see it as do the English Patient, Schindler's List, and some others. The realism of the emotions is so dramatic that it's impossible to avoid being drawn in. I agree with comments that the cutting away to the ""present"" with her children reading the diary was unnecessary, but this didn't ruin it for me.",The Bridges of Madison County
78,adeckofcards,An intimate relationship,10,28 June 2020,"In the history of cinema there have been countless romantic movies, you treat them differently, each with a particular stamp. However, not many remain as much in memory as Clint Eastwood's 'The Bridges of Madison County'.
The fleeting tale of two lovers is portrayed in an extremely intimate way by Eastwood. The construction of this intimacy is, as expected, totally classical. Creating increasingly closed shots when contact between protagonists occurs, thus portraying their closeness.
But beyond the usual mastery to direct and tell a story that Eastwood pours on the film, what is truly remarkable ends up being the relationship between the viewer and the story. A relationship as intimate as the one between the two protagonists.
In a very personal way I must say that the great achievement of this film seems to me to be the way in which it reminds us of what cinema is.. An art like no other, capable of transmitting feelings and generating a personal relationship with each viewer of in a different way, through genuinely beautiful human images and stories. It would be nice if there were more films capable of achieving this today, but it is not. And that allows us to keep a special place for those films that do, such as 'The Bridges of Madison County'.",The Bridges of Madison County

I have no doubt that it made some women cry. It made THIS woman cry. Only in my case it was due to mortification. Thank God, I'm old, but not senile.

80,gbrumburgh,An Affair to Remember.,9,24 May 2001,"""The Bridges of Madison County"" is a leisurely-paced, finely-tuned  romantic drama beautifully orchestrated by director/actor Clint Eastwood, with a transcending performance by Meryl Streep.Based on Robert James Waller's surprisingly successful novella, this project has Clint Eastwood straying from his formulaic action material and winding up with one of the most lyrical, passionate dramas to come out recently. Who knew Eastwood could aim so perfectly for the heart without the help of a gun and holster.In adapting this rather prosaic piece of prose for the screen, Eastwood shrewdly (and graciously) shifts the point of view from Robert Kincaid to Francesca Johnson.  With Meryl Streep as its primary focus, how could anything go wrong?  Streep is simply luminous here as the  foreign-born Iowa farmwife and mother consigned to a life of drudgery.  Her family away for the week, she happens upon a handsome, worldly photographer briefly in town scouting out locations for his next National Geographic spread.  What results is a beautifully mature story of spiritual and unconditional love. Eastwood himself displays a rare, vulnerable side as the taciturn Kincaid who has grown accustomed to a solitary, self-serving existence.  The chemistry between Eastwood and Streep is surprisingly potent and ultimately moving, a real tribute to their disparate talents.    With subtle nuance, we slowly become familiar with these two unlikely strangers in the night.  A harmless lunch...a cozier dinner...revealing conversation...a slight brush of the shoulder...the casual adjustment of a shirt collar...a spontaneous mating dance.  Once their true feelings finally come to the surface, we feel for them and understand and rationalize their attraction.  This is absolutely crucial in maintaining the beauty of the romance for it must reroute the obvious appearance of a housewife conducting an adulterous affair with some fly-by-night Romeo.  Significantly, Francesca's husband is not portrayed here as an abusive lout deserving of such betrayal.  He is simply a remote, unresponsive farmer who has settled routinely into mid-life -- still devoted to his family.The perfervid affair, of course, is beset with feelings of guilt, anguish and fear, but never regret.  Ever mindful of small-town gossip (one cruel restaurant scene has a known scarlet' woman openly ostracized by its patrons and employees), the couple find out-of-the-way places to go to enjoy their brief time together, while faced with the dilemma of their futures. The climactic scene in the truck with the tormented Francesca gripping the door handle, torn between staying in the truck with her unsuspecting husband or fleeing to Eastwood in the automobile stopped just ahead of them is one of the most searing, agonizing screen moments ever experienced by this viewer.A minor drawback to the film is the ""present day"" subplot device, which reappears sporadically and bookends the affair seen in flashback.  These scenes involve Francesca's two surviving children coming to terms with the discovery of their mother's past affair via letters, diaries and mementos purposely left to be read upon her death.  These segments are integral, to be sure, but awkwardly presented and annoyingly intrusive.Known for his deep love of jazz, Eastwood incorporates a wonderfully lush, often bluesy score, littered with familiar classics, notably by the late, great Dinah Washington, whose exquisite version of ""I'll Close My Eyes"" is a must for every music library, and Johnny Hartman, whose ""For All We Know"" highlights the lovers' initial encounter.  ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" despite its deliberately languid pace, is an enduring wallow for incurable romantics everywhere.  Simply, it is an affair to remember.",The Bridges of Madison County
81,jillbeckinheim7,The book was much better,7,27 October 2021,"I thought the book was much better....For instance, upon showing Robert the bridge, Francesca is actually a little bit annoyed that right away, this man become so absorbed with it that he seems to have forgotten about her.Streep portrayed that feeling beautifully, particularly in the tone of her voice, when she says something to the effect of 'I can wait, I have time', more to herself than to Robert. But then, annoyance becomes attraction, as we recall the general belief (albeit somewhat male-centered) that to a woman, a man is most attractive when he is fully absorbed in his work. The relationship develops in a wonderfully relaxed pace, with dropping her off home, 'care to come in for a coffee?', 'would you like to stay for dinner?'..all nice and friendly until Robert asks one question too many, although quite innocently, 'ever thought of leaving your husband?' Even with profuse apologies, the parting was a little shadowed.Calming down, Francesca reflects that she might have reacted too strongly, drives to the bridge in darkness and leaves a note to invite Robert back to dinner the following day. After seeing the note, Robert calls to accept the invitation, but asks Francesca to join him at the bridge at twilight as he wants to do some work there first. They then separately carry on with the day, Francesca going to buy a new dress for the occasion while Robert goes about with his business. But then, at lunch, he witnesses how a woman known to be having an affair is received in the restaurant (this is one of those small communities where everybody knows what everybody else is doing). Concerned that being seen with him might compromise Francesca, he calls her to give her the opportunity to back out. She seems unperturbed, they meet at the bridge, nothing untoward happens.",The Bridges of Madison County
82,mxsuba26,Lust and Loss in the Corn Fields,10,2 December 2018,"An erotic adventure set in rural Iowa in 1965 and later. Seriously bored, unhappily married but quite lusty war bride turned farm wife, Francesca, finds herself alone on her dreary Iowa farm for four days when hubby and the two teenage kids take off with prize steer to the Illinois county fair. She is stuck tending the corn and canning vittles and sometimes flashing the scare crow when it gets windy. She married a soldier turned civilian farmer hoping for a ticket to America and a life of adventure only to get what she considers drudgery in small town USA. Things change when Robert, an aging free range and randy Nat Geo photog bops into morally conservative and gossipy Madison County to take a few snappies of the local covered bridges. In the few scenes that show it, the residents of this town are mostly portrayed as overweight, homely or rude. Robert runs into Francesca when scoping out the bridges and sensing she is willing, presses hard toward the goal from the get go. He regales her with stories of his world travels while probing her about her happiness. This is also shown in several scenes of Robert admiring her back-end on the porch, long looks into her eyes and brushing against her several times. Robert also makes it clear on their first evening together that he has little use for morality or places any value on the traditional family. He is more of an amoral citizen of the world. In a bizarre analogy, he compares his morality to that of wild animals in Africa. Francesca finally bites and the two eventually hook up for four days getting their groove on in the bed, bathtub and beyond. Robert splits town a few days after her hubby and kids return from the fair. Even though he offered to take Francesca with him on his next adventure, she nearly left but instead decided due to a sense of duty to stay at Green Acres than go frolicking with the photog in some jungle.Fast forward a decade and a half later and Francesca's hubby has gone toes up leaving her alone on the farm to wonder about what may have been had she booked out of Iowa with Robert. Fast forward a second time to 1982 and Francesca finds out that Robert is now taking his dirt nap when the UPS man delivers a cardboard box to her home. Turns out that Robert left her his estate consisting of a couple beat up camera, his bracelet and her necklace she gave him in 1965 and a book detailing their four day fling. Old Francesca just got screwed again since that is it, no money, stocks, real estate or precious metals. Just a box of junk barely worthy of ebay. Turns out old Robert had no earning potential. Fast forward one final time to the 1990s and now Francesca is in the bone orchard and her two kids, both bitter losers themselves, discover her infidelity when they find Mom's tawdry journals detailing the love fest and Robert's box of junk. They fight over the situation with the daughter defending her mom's sexual adventures while the son believes old Robert was just getting his Tinder on. Then they both later conclude that Mom was right since she was so unhappy. The final scene is quite interesting with the daughter, wearing the dress Francesca bought for her first night a passion with Robert, stretched out on her Mom's bed in the farmhouse (the same bed ....), calling her husband to ask for a divorce. The apple does not fall far from the tree in Madison County.Moral of this story: Its not the farmer's daughter, but the farmer's wife is where its at.",The Bridges of Madison County
83,HarlequeenStudio,Very sweet,10,20 June 2017,"This was the first time that I watched Clint Eastwood as an actor. I knew who he was, but as a teenage girl, I wasn't interested in cowboys and Dirty Harry. But this love story was a huge hit, so I decided to watch it, in spite of Clint Eastwood. I expected a different sort of character, maybe more in line with Dirty Harry, but he seemed sweet. I also didn't expect to like him as an actor more than Meryl Streep, because Meryl was considered such a great actress and Clint was just a gunslinger. But then I realized that I preferred that kind of acting, simply based on presence, an actor who's not afraid to show who he is. And my female gaze loved the shirtless Clint. I just love it when an artist is full of surprises.",The Bridges of Madison County
84,inioi,"Simple, beautiful and Unpretentious",8,13 December 2015,"It is curious, as some reviewers write what Francesca should have done with his life before she would fall in love with Robert. There is usually a clear trend in some people, trying to impose their morality, and believe what is good or bad for others. So Francesca should do ""this"" or ""that"" ... and anything other than that, it's wrong.I'm not interested in making an objection just to go into a matter. For me, the story is quite simple. Probably Francesca was not tired of her husband, or she was not in search of adventure. Just she met a man she liked more, and decided to go with what she felt. Anyway, at the end of four days of romance everything back the way it was, which is quite credible.In the end, the story is beautifully told, and it has moments of uncertainty, sexual tension, drama, love ... and it is stylishly directed.8/10",The Bridges of Madison County

I had my reservations, because I don't usually like chick flicks, as they are usually just don't deal in reality, and give women an unreal expectation of romance, love and life. This movie was basically just what I expected, NOT WORTH WATCHING. I don't understand why anyone under any circumstance would condone a wife cheating on her husband? I felt badly for the husband she was cheating on, he was a descent man and did not deserve a wife who was so lose. If she wanted to sleep around she should have gotten divorced.

I've come accustom over recent years to see how much Eastwood has developed as a director. His films have generated a lot of interest and I think it's because how he manages to pull at our heart strings and convey the sentimentality between characters. 'Bridges of Madison' does just that pulls you in by the chemistry of Streep and Eastwood. It's also the beautiful storyline and how it's told through flash back after the death of Francesca. She leaves a letter to her 2 children explaining her love affair with Robert Kincaid, a man she met some 30 yrs prior.

Ingredients? Streep's complete surrender to the character's essential motivation to live, in all it's complexity. And Eastwoods complete surrender as a director, to sensitivity, unspoken truth's of characters, music etc.
And last but not least that which is mentioned best in a German saying: 'the master shows himself in limitation'.
Nowhere the drama derails...For me personally i have to hold back my enotions everytime an American filmmaker shows in music and light what is so un-american: sentiment for the past and what is gone, and will never return. Eastwood is a master in doing that.
This sentiment expresses itself in the passing lives of unknown immigrants that build America as a nation. They live simple lives, like this Italian woman, giving her live to raise America's strength for the next generation. No statues, no recognition.
In this movie her simple live is pulled out in the light, sentimental, un-spectacular dramatic, told a thousand times,But it is True and Human.And 'truthfulness' is what makes this movie worth watching.",The Bridges of Madison County

The scene at the traffic lights near the end breaks my heart every time even though I've now seen this film at least 10 times.

Not a perfect adaptation from the book, but close enough.",9,1 June 2019,"My two favourite books are Wuthering Heights and Bridges of Madison County; so I am - in essence - a sucker for a love story.I have gone through numerous copies of the book (on my fifth now) and each copy has been very well read. This timeless, fascinating, warm, engaging and soul inspiring story couldn't be improved.I am not a fan of Meryl Streep. Not only do I find her acting slightly bovine, but her insistence on involving herself - often rather erroneously and embarrassingly - in politics and legal matters makes it very difficult to distance that behaviour from her performances; a cautionary tale for actors: stick to acting!I didn't find Streeps performance in this adaptation to be particularly special, but through careful mental judo, managed to fall back on the Francesca created in my mind from the book.The movie remains close enough to the book to be engaging and is a sometimes welcome departure from reading a book I now know so well, I can recite every line from memory.",The Bridges of Madison County

There was no reason for her to have an affair. None at all. She brought it all upon herself.And what did the photographer care? He was just passing through town and had ladies like her everywhere. What made her so special? She was a married woman with kids. A true love would not make you break your vows to your husband and take advantage of you in your own home like that. I didn't buy the ""love"" story at all.This movie is about LUST. Plain and simple. No love. If she would've gotten out of that truck it would've been for lust, not love. And then what?

A relationship which is profound yet unconventional. The film is an exploration of how bonding between human beings does not always follow societal rules and norms, of the perennial dilemma of the head and the heart, nature and culture. With great sensitivity, The Bridges of Madison County lays out the relationship in its most honest form and raises the question as to whether there can be a correlation between the conventional, accepted norms and morality at all times. The acting is top-notch, with Meryl Streep essaying a character in agony as only she can.

He is a journeyman professional with a woman in every port of call; but Francesca (Streep) is different. Not only is she married - she's the only woman he'll ever truly love.  And she, tragically, realises exactly the same of him...Robert J Waller's novel is adapted awkwardly here thanks to the imposition of a weak and unconvincing framing narrative involving the children of Francesca discovering her secret love days after her death.  Their needs and loves are irrelevent to us, the viewer (and are treated lamely by Eastwood the director), because we want to follow the story of pure love between Kincaid and Francesca: A love that exists tangibly for four days but is metaphysically timeless.  This part of the movie offers a romantic drama of considerable grace and power in which Eastwood gives a performance of great strength opposite a Streep of staggering excellence.  The closing scenes in which they see one another for the final time - and then she receives his most treasured belongings after his death - are so painfully moving that they will sear into the memory of anyone who has ever really loved and lost; long after the rest of the film has become a blur.",The Bridges of Madison County

All writers have these moments. The story bode well of the bored but loving house wife grabbing her halcyon moment of life...This was a tearjerker extrordinaire second to none...The brief moving scene of Clint getting soaked, while looking on to his love encounter was superlative and gave credence and credit to the fact that this movie deserved accolade allround in which it rightfully did so.

106,WWmoviejunkie,"Artful film about illicit , adulterous passion.",6,28 January 2018,"An artfully made film about illicit , adulterous passion between middle-aged , bored , restless , small-town housewife , Mrs. Francesca Johnson / Meryl Streep & a National Geographic photographer , Robert Kincaid / Clint Eastwood ; a bachelor on assignment in Iowa for a week , to photograph its covered bridges in 1965 .
Although this film is portrayed as a great ' love ' story- it is actually Francesca who takes the initiative to prey on an unsuspecting Robert and seduce him ( with multiple offers to show him directions to a bridge he's searching for , later peeking at him through gaps in the wooden bridge , spying on him when he took off his shirt to wash up , invitations for lemonade at noon / dinner in the evening , when she's alone at home, going upstairs & tarting herself up with earrings for Kincaid's benefit )
Each time the current activity runs out- Francesca ingeniously finds a new way to prolong her discourse with Kincaid by further plying him with fresh invitations.
Robert appears genuine , friendly & genial and the two forge an instantaneous friendship.
After a daytime encounter in a diner with Ms. Redfield , the town's ' bad woman ' , where Robert Kincaid sees how another adulterous woman is treated as an outcast by the townspeople , Kincaid contemplates putting the brakes on his new friendship with Mrs. Johnson.
Being an out-of-towner, Kincaid had nothing to lose , yet he was not an opportunist & was empathetic enough to ernestly caution Francesca against going out on a friendly day trip with him while he worked , so that she wouldn't get 'compromised' around town .But Francesca was too unethical & determined in her pusuit of passion , excitement & her plans to see Kincaid , no matter what ( even loosely purchasing a new dress to go out with him ) Neither did having a 17 year old son, a daughter & being married for two decades to a good & honest man, Richard Johnson & backstabbing him ( while he was away for 4 days at the Illinois state fair with their children ) weigh too heavily on Francesca - who was determined to live vicariously through Robert Kincaid, questioning him closely about his travels / exotic destinations / romantic trysts which seemed exciting to her , in contrast to her own dull Iowa farm life .By the second evening Francesca manages to attain her goal to sleep with Kincaid, finally experiencing passion in her dull life . They drive out of town on further day trips to jazz joints etc .When Francesca's 4 days of being alone are almost up ( before her family returned ) she , without provocation , lashes out at Robert ( who was consistently genial & gentlemanly - for a man who's sleeping with another's wife ) , angry that she had reduced herself to just another one of Kincaids romantic trysts from around the globe .
Her anger didn't stem from any post-coital , adulterous regret or guilt about back-stabbing her poor husband ; but from her insecurity about being a plain , uninteresting farm wife who lived in the middle of nowhere and her longing to be special to someone exotic like Robert Kincaid .
After her unkind ( & uncalled for ) attack , Robert Kincaid , always the gentleman , doesn't respond in kind , but shockingly rises to the occassion , assures her that his association with her is special to him and puts his money where his mouth is by asking her to leave with him , risking his own heart , instead of taking a more convenient ' wham, bam, thank you Ma'am ' exit .
Mollified , Francesca packs up to elope with Robert, feeling validated & special . On their final dinner in the house, after getting whatever she wanted from Robert , Francesca hypocritically decides that now, her husband , Richard doesn't deserve to be treated so badly by her & neither do her children .
Robert Kincaid , who could've left unequivocally after a passionate 4 day tryst , enjoyed by both sides , now has risked his heart after the admission of love & the offer to elope , forced out of him by Francesca's abusive tongue-lashing from before .
He leaves the house broken-hearted, telling her that she may change her mind after her family arrives & that he will still be in town for a few more days - where she may see him & decide to leave with him after all .
In the end we see Francesca out shopping with Richard ( who is clueless about his two-faced wife ) when she runs into Robert who's very painfully & heartbreakingly , standing in the rain without compromising her publicly , waiting to see if she'll leave with him .In the end , Francesca was neither true to Richard nor to Robert - she just used both men . She cheated on her husband and broke Kincaid's heart .Richard Johnson dies years later , never finding out the truth about how his wife abused his faith & Robert Kincaid dies being true to his illicit & misplaced ' love ' , thus never giving himself the chance to find real , clean love in a legitimate relationship with an honourable lady .Apparently this wasn't enough for Francesca who , after her death leaves journals for her middle aged children to catch up with their mother's thrilling indiscretion . Francesca claims she's being honest with them but like an exhibitionist , includes unnecessary erotic details .
The only good outcome from the illicit passion was that after reading the journals & reflecting on the contents , Francesca's two children take a second look at their own lives & troubled marriages , with the son deciding to repair his relationship with his long suffering wife & the daughter deciding not to be a doormat to a philandering , weak husband.",The Bridges of Madison County

111,rimsey-2,Chick Flick,3,29 November 2000,"I don't normally try to characterize movies with cheap epithets like ""Chick Flick"" but in this case I thought it was appropriate. I found the initial premise of the film interesting and it soon drew me in (i.e. children discovering a hidden side to their mother's after her death). What initially put me off was discovering that Meryl Streep was meant to be Italian. I have great admiration for Streep as an actress but for the first part of the movie I kept trying to work out which country her accent was meant to be from. I decided eventually on Russian. Blow me down if it doesn't turn out that she's meant to be Italian. My parents are Italian and I've heard a lot of English spoken with Italian accents in my life but none of them sounded like Meryl Streep. To compound things even further she later tells Clint Eastwood that she's from a ""small town"" in Italy that he would never have heard of. She eventually tells him that this small town is called Bari and learns to her great surprise that he has not only heard of it but has visited it and was so entranced by what he saw that he broke his train journey and stopped there for a few days. Now I know that Americans are notoriously ignorant about other countries but Bari happens to be a large urban centre and while it has some sites worth visiting it is hardly the picturesque small town that seems to be suggested in the movie. From that point on the movie began to lose me more and more. I found it generally dull and thought it was exploiting its viewers emotions. A pity really because I thought that some of the portrayals of a marriage that were shown had great insight. I left before it finished. My wife stayed.",The Bridges of Madison County
112,critic_w,"An absolutely terrible ""romance"" movie! Is it just me, or is love no longer a part of romance?",3,18 February 2006,"Bridges of Madison County is probably the worst so-called romance movie I have ever seen. If you disagree answer these questions: Why would Francesca believe he loves her? Because of a few ""lines"" professing his, what? Great opportunity? His good times with her? What he said was ""This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime."" What was ""certain"" about it? Was it more ""certain"" than the wife he divorced without regret? Romance note, before you trash your life, such as it is, and run off with someone who has managed to abandon one marriage, and looks down on commitment in general, AT LEAST know that he loves you! And if he really does, he will NOT ask you to abandon your children!Another question; What exactly did he see in her? What was so special and different to leave him without sense enough to come in from the rain? Are these two ""soul-mates,"" or is she just a woman who needs to feel loved and frustrated enough with her life to have sex with a total stranger. Was the sex sooooo life altering that he was willing to finally settle down? Passion and love, let's not confuse the two, one can last four days, perhaps a week, maybe a year... the other a lifetime. Sure, drop everything and go... he's got nothing to lose, while she'll lose what little she has. That is NOT romance, it's sad. It's insulting. The more you think about it, the more his ""certainty"" plays like a pickup line.And when did these DEEP LASTING emotions develop, from the 3 or 4 conversations they had? While driving along in the truck? Or was it when they were soiling the sheets in the bed where she was to sleep with her husband? Which brings me to the issue of infidelity, and the dim view of marriage in general? He doesn't seem to value it, she ""suffers"" through it. In this lopsided ""romantic"" story there's scarcely a happy couple to be found, let alone happily married one. As a GUY who LOVES romance, please, PLEASE do not accept this counterfeit tripe of an offering as real romance. Hollywood has gotten so lazy as to toss us a scrap and expect us to gobble it up as fillet! A man who asks a woman to leave her husband, and her kids who are ""almost grown"" is thinking of himself. A REAL man, and REAL love would offer to do whatever you wanted to make YOU happy. He would say I cannot bear to lose you BEFORE you had to have a conniption-fit in the kitchen. HE would be devastated on that last day BEFORE you served breakfast, before you did anything, and would take you by the hand and ask you to sit down, and with a lump in his throat the size of Iowa look you in the eyes and ask, ""What are WE going to do?"" THAT is romance. It's not a 4-day teenage fling with older actors. It's no-matter-what, 'till the end, 'till death do us part!HUSBANDS listen up! Your wives are quietly telling you something. Get busy and do your duty as a husband. Sure she's adjusted her life for you, sometimes sacrificially, but you are bound to do all within your power to see that she is happy and fulfilled! She should feel LOVED!",The Bridges of Madison County
113,michaeldaly99,Beautiful,8,14 April 2005,"Wow, this was certainly different to Eastwood's usual directed/produced/starring pictures. He is truly a multi-talented star, managing to direct, produce and act in picture after picture - not just that, but managing to do so in brilliant picture after brilliant picture. Since he took the director's chair, has he let us down once? He's had one or two silly flicks - á la Blood Work - but even the worst of which have remained utmost enjoyable four-star flicks... And this amazingly sensitive and warm piece of work is the best of his four-star flicks...His wife has described Clint's character in this, Robert Kincaid, to be the most like the actor in personality out of all his characters... If this is true, then he really deserved to get to where he is. What a gentle, kind man... Clint takes a break from the tough guy cowboy/cop, and takes on a warm-hearted and charismatic photogorapher who doesn't have a threatening bone in his body... He does the part almost flawlessly, showing some real emotion, this a truly three-dimensional performance from Clint.......But it must be said that he pales in comparison to his partner Meryll Streep. I had only seen her in one film before this - Angels in America - and back then, I was just outright impressed. But after this...WOW... What a perfectly emotional and teary performance... We really feel for her on every level... A role worthy of its Oscar, Meryll's 11th nomination I believe... WOW, again...There is no action in this flick... Yes, it will bore your average Scarface/Bad Boys action seeking teen... But if you're patient and can get past a rather slow opening, you will LOVE this... I think this is the kinda film that housewives watch and cry together on their girls' nights... It is just that touching... Exciting? Not really, it's completely laid back and easy-going..

114,Meiling2Movie,The best marriage movie and the best love movie,10,5 February 2021,"For some reason, I cried a lot during the movie, when Francesca barely watched Robert waiting for her in the rain or when Francesca's husband talked to her before his death, now I know why.
And from love perspective, it seems that she fell in love twice, once with her husband and second time with Robert, ja, maybe one can fall in love many times. I remember that Robert said that he feels like his love towards Francesca only comes once in a lifetime. So it was real love between Robert and Francesca.
From marriage perspective, Francesca was unfaithful to her husband. She is lucky that no one in the town found out about her. I am not sure if Francesca went with Robert and their marriage may not last longer, and she said the things left behind her will destroy the love or the four days being together and decides to keep marriage. Francesca could keep marriage although she does not always enjoy with knowing it is marriage she sacrificed for true love.

I Should think that that would be no surprise to anyone who loved the book, since the film does no real justice to the heart of the novel! What do I mean? Well, that is both somewhat complicated and simple. But in short the screenplay writers and indeed the director have taken a novel which was about a man who was a poet, a visionary and a shaman, (Who was almost completely out of, and beyond time,) and basically turned him into a two bit prick with pants! And if that wasn't bad enough they have also turned the lead female character into a midlife dissatisfied housewife who needs some action, when in the original she was a real, European woman, found as if by surprise in the UnDead Midwestern state of OHiO-IoWa, simply in awe of a man who faced the world completely on his own terms, and who was quite unwilling to try to ""civilize"" him! I knew, when I saw an interview with Meryl, about the upcoming film, that this adaptation was going to be a total hack job! In the interview she stated that she was given assurances, from Mr. Eastwood, that ""all that wordy, poetic stuff"" that was in the novel, would NOT be on display in the film.That was also when I knew that the woman I fell madly in love with, who made such an amazing character as Sarah Woodrough, in the incredible film ""The French Lieutenant's Woman,"" was not the same as the characters she has played {big surprise.}I would then conclude that Ms. Streep is far more likely to be like the character she plays in films like ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" than any character she played, when she was a younger actress!",The Bridges of Madison County

'The bridges of Madison County' does just that. About 15 minutes into the film Clint and Meryl meet for the first time and the majority of the film is about the blossoming relationship between them from that first moment. The performances were so great from both of them and Meryl Streep captured the Italian accent so well. The surroundings were very beautiful too, i don't know if this was really filmed in  Iowa or not but the beautiful surroundings fitted the film perfectly. It's a very slow moving film but that works very well for this genre. I found it to be one of those types of films were you can't miss a single word, i needed total and complete silence and i couldn't take my eyes away for a single moment.

119,abelardo64,love with the proper stranger,10,3 January 2005,"The book on which this film is based is a very thin volume, thin in every department. As a matter of fact I gave up after a few pages. The film is something else entirely. Meryl Streep plays an Italian living in rural America and she is out of this world. Her opening scenes at the breakfast table are staggeringly beautiful, it could have been a silent movie, we would've understood and live Francesca's story just by looking into Meryl's beautiful face. Every laugh, every move, every nuance is so Italian and so real that I went to look up her background to see if there was some Italian blood in her. Apparently not, but she reminded me of Anna Magnani and of my mother - she's Italian too, so I should know. Clint Eastwood's performance is tender, powerful and generous. I started going to the movies in the 70's and part of the fascination was to go and see movies with adults doing adult things, behaving and reacting to life the way adults do. ""Five Easy Pieces"" ""Coming Home"" ""Sophie's Choice"" and then the old great old ones from ""Sullivan's Travels"" to ""All About Eve"" As a side note I should inform the decision makers that on my second visit to the theater I took five kids with me, two 17 year old boys and three girls, 18, 16 and 16. They went back to see it a few days later with some of their contemporaries. The comment of one of the boys was: ""It made me think of things I don't usually think about"". He invited his mom to the movies to see ""Bridges of Madison County"" According to his mother, that was the first time ever, but, as it happens, not the last.",The Bridges of Madison County
120,Jen_UK,A cinematic silk purse from a literary sow's ear ...,8,11 September 2003,"I only managed about two pages of the book before feeling physically ill by the trite dialogue, heavy dependence on cliche and ham fisted, adolescent romance prose style. So a film of the book 'The Bridges of Madison County' did not fill me with joy and pleasureable anticpation.Yet Clint Eastwood has waved a magic wand, and worked wonders on the lack lustre source material, by pairing it down to produce a beautiful, warm film with only one real flaw (more on that later)The film's overwhelming main strength is the casting of Meryl Streep. As Francesca she dissolves into the role - at times her gestures and dialogue seem so natural and unforced it is as if Eastwood had installed a fly-on-the-wall camera into the house of a real Iowan housewife. She lifts the film - which does centre on themes which could appear trite in the wrong hands - to the level of profound piece of art. Her selflessness and devotion to her family, and tortured sense of divided loyalites are presented so powerfully, and so plausibly, that the final scene in the car at the end (those who've seen it will recall immediately what I mean) pulls at your emotions so hard you'd swear it was you who was making the decision. I defy anyone with a pulse not to shed copious amounts of tears at this point --- you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved on some level by this great, great performance.Clint Eastwood provides good, solid support in the sense that he doesn't overact, and allows Meryl to become the heart of the film. This is a wise decision - part of the terrible weakness of the book was its dependence upon the inane thoughts and ramblings of Robert Kincaid. The film is beautifully directed, beautifully photograhed and beautifully scored - the radio tunes and the non-diegetic Bridges Love theme really enhance the romantic, lush tone and mood of the film.My only problem is with the misguided decision to cast Francesca's older children and flash back periodically to them reading through their Mother's journals. The acting in these parts is mediocre at best, and they detract from the elegance and poignant mastery of Meryl Streep's central performance. The ashes scene at the end is - I feel - necessary for closure, but the rest of the scenes featuring the chldren should have been scrapped. The Francesca and Robert sections stand alone and require no interruption - these other segments cheapen the mastery of Meryl.Above all, this is a film which (on paper) can be dismissed as pure soap opera. But it transcends these potentially trite themes to make a universal story of love, selflessness, devotion and choice, that speaks eloquently to the viewer, no matter what your age or experience. It's a truly heartbreaking tale of transitory experience and the power of memory. It will make you think about your own life, and about your closest family members and relationships.And its finest quality has to be the magic of Meryl Streep who proves, yet again, why she is uniquely the best actress we have ever had. As Clint Eastwood said about casting this role: 'I only made one phonecall'. He knew as you will too - no other actress could have brought so much depth, warmth, beauty, charisma and humanity to this character. As a humble film lover, it's all I can do to applaud her from the depths of my heart. Bravo, Queen Meryl!",The Bridges of Madison County

The plot, screenplay, soundtrack and cinematography are done in a manner that leaves you in a daze. I never expected that Eastwood could direct such a forceful romantic movie. This movie can easily rank among the best romantic movies of all time. It is strange but a true fact that Dirty Harry could give such a balanced and heart touching finish to the novel written by Robert James Waller.

He writes about the casting of Francesca and says very succinctly ""I made only one call."" My only reason for giving a 9 is that I never wanted the movie to end which it unfortunately does after 135 minutes.It's no wonder that Streep has been time and again acclaimed as the greatest ever ,this despite the presence of Robert De Niro,Jack Nicholson ,Jodie Foster Katherine Hepburn and many others.",The Bridges of Madison County

There was a movie from the early 40s, Brief Encounter, which had the exact same theme.I felt very uncomfortable watching this movie. It was all very obvious, not at all subtle and consequently embarrassing. Also, it was somewhat unrealistic, i.e., when, after they lovers have separated, Eastwood standing drenched in the pouring down rain just staring/glaring at Francesca in the truck. Francesca's ""nervous breakdown"" of despair in the truck. There she is choking back tears, collapsing into the corner of the seat, hands fluttering all around, while her husband rolls his eyes and keeps driving. Probably attributing it to ""womens' issues"". I mean, afterall, they were just discussing meatloaf. This thing with the hands was really distracting, it was like she had two pigeons tied to them, they fluttered around throughout the movie, but not in an ""italian"" way. More like a ""unwell Southern Belle"" or 1950s East Village beatnik chick.In general, I found Francesca rather unsypmathetic. She turns on the opera on the radio for dinner, her daughter comes in, turns it to rock n' roll. Francesca, the great martyr, sighs and rolls her eyes. There were some nice scenes, but the dialogue was SOOOOO heavy-handed and maudlin. Probably would have made a great stage play...lots of self-revelation.I enjoy Meryl Streep in most things, especially Sophie's Choice and Ironweed. And she wasn't exactly bad in this, but not particularly memorable, either. Eastwood's character, however, was just a rehash of Finch-Hatton/Redford in Out of Africa. He was ghastly. The most emoting he should ever do should be similar to that done in In the Line of Fire. That's about the extent of his range.

That opening breakfast scene where all of her story is written in her magnificent face. As an Italian I know there is no acting involved here. She IS Italian. She reminded me of Anna Magnani in ""Bellissima"" there is not a single false note. Clint Eastwood, clearly, dedicates the film to her and the results are pure magic. The film is based on an unreadable book- at least I couldn't get through it, in spite of the brevity of the volume - the film however, is bound to become a classic thanks to the powerful chemistry of the stars. If you love film,like I do, I recommend you to see it once and let yourself be taken away by the truths in Meryl's eyes then go again and take note. Look at every one of her moments, from how she closes the refrigerator door to her laughter. Look at her reaction when she discovers that Clint stopped at Bari, her home town, just because he thought the place was pretty. Look at her hands, her walk and then go back to her eyes.

Meryl Streep could never be Italian. Well, there I was, thinking and pre-judging like people I detest. I was so wrong. Not just because she fooled me, although there is no fooling involved here. She won me over. I forgot she was Meryl Streep, the actress, and I lived Francesca's story to the fullest because, I suppose, that's the mystery of great acting, I was confronted by her sheer undiluted truth. The truth in her eyes in every one of her gestures. The truth on her brow. Her thinking, transparent. Clint Eastwood does the right thing putting the entire film at her service and placing himself as the foil to liberate that powerful latent side of Francesca. I though it was ironic and I'm not sure if was meant to be that a wonderful woman like Francesca will sacrifice, what could arguably be call the love of her life, for those children. The grown children's mediocrity was kind of shocking to me. Will the revelation of their mother's secret, reveal a latent, greater side to their natures. I hope so.

131,ajudki20,A Bit Flat Due to Flaws,4,16 November 2017,"I finally saw this film after vaguely hearing about it for years. It was a little different than I expected within the 'Iowa housewife gets swept off her feet by a mysterious traveler' concept.There seems to be an ideological split in the reviews of this film beyond the normal love/hate thing. It basically boils down to people who find the concept beautiful and romantic(as intended) and those who think all infidelity is repugnant and this film is a creepy justification for it. I'm not into those camps--I don't really like infidelity and yet the film has beautiful concepts and moments and maybe that can overcome the moral failings of infidelity at times. My bigger question is how does the film handle the concepts, material and characters?The concept of the film is interesting. I was surprised how short the span (4 days) covered is and how intense things got in that time. That is hard to portray. Streep is so lauded that I guess I expected more from her. She emotes well in the waterworks scenes but... Little things bothered me. One is her accent (which seemed off) and the exotica of how she is Italian, living in what seems a numbing and strange land to her. I think it would have been more interesting if she was a 100% Iowan corn fed housewife who Eastwood's character still felt was exotic and sublime. Her Italian aspect makes the exotica and romance seem too easy, too expected, too asked for in the middle of Iowa. Her portrayal is also slightly dense and even charmless, at times. It doesn't gel with the wise, worldly sounding old woman in the journals pleading people to follow true love, even if in the afterlife. This has a way of not only being a bit dull (who wants to watch a film about a charmless women receiving undue attention?) but also making us wonder why Eastwood is so interested in her. It's not that we think about all his travels and think 'why HER?' like she does in the breakfast scene. It's that even if he hardly ever met women, only from a small regional area, it would still seem strange he was so taken by this somewhat dense and boring woman, a woman reticent to follow her passion (even when given the opportunity of a lifetime). Eastwood simply does his Eastwood thing, but it falls right into charming, authentic, independent minded photographer, and it is no wonder why SHE is interested him. The last problem with Streep's character is her history. We don't know anything about it. We just see she's in this marriage and family, and maybe not thrilled about it. The sacrifice she makes, the boredom she feels under the surface, the lack of true love that gets brought out by Eastwood's character are a bit hard to have empathy for. We are left to assume she chose these circumstances under willing conditions. So on some level the almost victimhood we are expected to buy into in order to cheer on the infidelity and true love in the film is difficult to buy into. Her problems are her own fault and at the core, she's simply unwilling to rock the boat and do anything to make herself more happy and this cuts back on some of the heartbreak and empathy we feel at the end of the movie. I felt it more for Eastwood's character (though it is confusing why he took so strongly to her, he plays it well, and it is clear he's heartbroken). But I think it needed to be a total two way street for the film to work right.The bookend aspect of the kids learning about all this through things left after Francesca's (Streep) death is a cute idea to add some depth to the message of the movie. The lack of full development in the romance kind of demands a secondary element to enrich. But the acting is second rate and compared to Eastwood and Streep (even if it isn't their best work) it feels like parts of a Hallmark Channel movie pasted onto a real movie.The whole Bridges/charming Iowa countryside thing is a hook, a fun setting framing device. But I did hope they would do more with it. The history and draw of the bridges isn't brought into the meaning of the film at all. The cinematography is not very interesting or expansive, and the actual film minutes dedicated to the surroundings are limited. In fact, the film feels claustrophobic, with much of it taking place in the farmhouse kitchen/dining room. We get only the most limited and cliché feel for small town Iowa life in the 1960's an how to a certain type of soul it would suck at the oxygen.Overall, this is a more flawed and run of the mill romance than I was hoping for.",The Bridges of Madison County

Concluding you've found it after a 4-day encounter is probably not the wisest decision you will ever make. It's an exciting escape, but of questionable value upon which to build a relationship. In only 4 days, they've already have two arguments. Francesca's family lets the door slam, which bothers her, but she takes no issue with Richard sitting at the dinner table and flicking his cigarette ashes on the floor. How long would that tolerance last? She plays Italian opera on the radio (does such a station really exist in rural Iowa?), which her children rudely change without even asking. Yet, she doesn't seem to care that the radio plays light jazz (not Italian opera) when Richard is there.

133,avdvelden,This film makes me cry each time I see it,10,11 March 2000,"I watched this wonderful movie 3 times in cinema and a few times at home and it still makes me cry each time, because the story sets a rare example of how more important it is to keep a marriage intact rather than following your heart, which is usually not in the best interest of everyone involved. It's Meryl Street's best role, for me.",The Bridges of Madison County
134,JANA-7,"A ""Good Portrayal"" of Waller's romantic novella.",6,20 October 2001,"The question of ""Adultry"" doesn't sway my view of this film, however the casting does. For those who have read the book, the film follows the Waller's romantic endeavor about an unattached National Geographic photographer and a naturalized Italian/American housewife in the mid-west. Perhaps contractual or legal aspects of bringing this novella to the screen resulted in an Eastwood/Streep tandem. Streep is a great American actress with tons of credentials. Eastwood has proven his worth in both acting and directing. Without naming anyone, I feel that several other male/female tandems could have made this movie ""Great"". As it stands I credit it with a respectable ""6"". Streep's italian accent was off the mark and once more she looks as much Italian as Katie Hepburn. Great love story for romantics, could have been a movie milestone with the right actors.",The Bridges of Madison County
135,Star_Red,Great acting (as usual) from Meryl Streep!,8,27 February 2003,"I regard Bridges of Madison County mainly as a story about a housewife & mother's strength to endure her daily life of serving her family while continuously being ignored. Francesca finds new strength through a romantic, sensual, albeit a very short affair with a worldly and sensitive photographer. I don't approve of adultery yet I cannot fully condemn it here. The film manages to depict their affair as a naturally evolving, mature relationship, as if a ten-year-long relationship were condensed into four days. It is mainly due to Meryl Streep's vivid acting that the affair appears neither trivial nor lewd. Her performance radiates all the love, longing, and passion of Francesca. Clint Eastwood was very believable and had the right chemistry with Streep, but I found his directing sometimes a bit too slow, though overall he created a nice atmosphere for Francesca's story. The only major complaint I have are the two actors who played the grown-up son and daughter. They were always overacting and were rather an annoyance to watch.",The Bridges of Madison County

But sometimes, on VERY rare occasions, I actually sob.  Schindler's List.  Cinema Paradiso.  The Pianist.  But this movie - this sappy chick flick - I cried like a baby.  And damn if it didn't feel GOOD.So, if you're looking for a damn fine romance that's seamlessly made, and sobbing like a small child sounds really really good to you, I'd DEFINITELY recommend this movie.",The Bridges of Madison County
137,Jaguara333,Fantastic performance by Meryl Streep but ...,7,15 September 2017,Streep delivers a fantastic and convincing performance full of subtlety...but the film is paced extremely slow and the flow is constantly broken by the jarring transitions to her present day children reading her diary. The acting in those sequences is strikingly bad and destroys any sense of immersion in the story. A cut of this film without those sequences would be at least one star higher...maybe more since I cannot truly tell if I would have been more drawn into the story without them.,The Bridges of Madison County
138,roning,Brilliant actors makes it work,6,23 March 2000,"This story would be nearly pathetic with any other two actors in the leading roles.

139,MadMatt7,More wonderful Hollywood b.s. morality,1,30 May 2003,"Yes, technically the movie was well filmed and had some lovely cinematography, but it was also obviously written to tug on the heartstrings of those viewers easily given to sentimental mush.***Spoiler to follow***My biggest beef is with the story, itself, and the message it gives. Here we have a middle-aged bored housewife who's going through a midlife crisis and longs for some excitement. So what else is new? I'm middle-aged and I'd like some excitement, too, please. Enter our rugged traveling photographer, Clint Eastwood, and, a few screws later, our housefrau has now found the love of her eternal life????? Of course she's horny for him: he's exciting, adventurous, a deep-thinker, poetic - but very selfish and crappy family material. Meanwhile, her devoted husband of umpteen years, who is not abusive in any way and has stood by her through thick and thin takes the back seat because he's...well, boring. As a married man of 10 years with 2 children, I guess this gives me free license to dump my wife and kids if I suddenly wake up one morning and find them tedious in comparison to some hot new chick that really turns me on. It also makes me feel really good to know that, right now, my wife is probably fantasizing about dumping me for some rugged, exciting, outdoorsy type.This is basically another Jack and Rose Titanic situation, where the audience is deliberately kept from the reality of what would happen if these two shmucks really did get together. Namely, Clint would dump Meryl when he got tired of having sex with her or Meryl would dump Clint when she finally figured out what a twit he was. Well, it's nice to know that they will be stuck with each other for eternity - under a bridge of Madison County.",The Bridges of Madison County
140,oranjestad-99120,This film remind us of the famous film Brief encounter (director Noel Coward),8,17 July 2018,"Philips99us wrote a good review: I agree fully with his opinion.
What he noticed was just that what makes it a good film: interesting about what love can do to people in general. The dialogues, written by someone who knows his craft, are about what really matters in this film.
Technically very well made on all aspects. Special attention was given to the soundtrack with beautifull songs. You could think sometimes: were they composed especially for this movie?
Only one time I was amazed: why not a real kind of attention by the husband can be seen at the end of the movie to his wife when she (Meryl Streep) shows deep emotions in the car on the way home after seeing for the last time her love ""for four days""?
Fascinating acting by Clint Eastwood, once played a cowboy in Rawhide in the sixties...
And also, as always, by Meryl Streep: what an art of acting: wonderfull!",The Bridges of Madison County
141,Rodion15,A masterpiece.,9,14 May 2000,"A masterpiece.  Stands out for the maturity of its characters (a  trait uncommon in love films).  Yet I sometimes think of Clint Eastwood's character as a bastard who interferes dangerously in a stable family; were it not so, I'd say it's the best movie that I've seen.",The Bridges of Madison County
142,kennethsorling,Marvellous Meryl,7,18 August 2007,"It isn't often I become in awe of somebody's acting skills, however great they are. Mostly, because the very best acting really shouldn't make an impression of its own. That is its very definition.Case in point: Meryl Streep. It is hard to deny that she is more Goddess than actor to most people, much like Jack Nicholson, she's become an icon unto herself. This regardless of whether you like her or not.Which makes it so much more impressive when Streep pulls off a magic trick of major magnitude: making the audience forget it's actually her. She does so quickly and seemingly effortlessly, which is crucial to the suspension of disbelief required to become involved in this sappy love story. It's no minor feat, considering she's Meryl-f*cking-Streep! (attach as many exclamation points as you like, depending on how gay you are).So, what about the movie itself? Clearly a superior work to the underlying novel, thanks to skillful direction and overall good performances. Definitely moving in a bitter-sweet way. In my opinion, it's just a little too soppy for me to think it's truly great. But despite its being such a blatant tearjerker, it's nevertheless appealing and gripping. Something to cleanse your sinuses and refresh your soul.Kudos especially to Eastwood, who has repeatedly proved himself a far superior director than actor (and that's saying some). But overall, this is Meryl Streep's victory over her own cult status. Halle Berry was right: she must be the best actress of all time.",The Bridges of Madison County
143,justcoolb,Great movie?!,5,11 March 2008,"This movie is only for women who need to satisfy their need for fantasy love affairs. This movie was put together well and at least kept to story but it was long and drawn out for a movie about a simple affair. The brother and sister did terrible acting. Not to mention in my personal opinion that this movie is just average because it tries to prove that having an affair is OK. Don't get married if you wanna run off with some guy and leave your husband thats never let you down or treated you badly. Yes it had decent ending but 2 good actors, a good ending, and some romantic scenes don't make a movie great. Neither does action or special effects mind you.",The Bridges of Madison County
144,barrymalvina,This cannot be accepted as representative of true romance,2,3 March 2013,"My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think.One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women.Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished.As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love.Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband.We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.",The Bridges of Madison County
145,KaylaMaster,Underwhelming & Overrated,4,27 December 2014,"After seeing bits and pieces of this film on too many occasions, I finally sat down to really watch it. For what seems like forever, I have known that this is the quintessential ""chick flick"" that makes women swoon and cry. Huh?I found it formulaic and foolish. Hmmm, 4 days? Four days, you decide that a guy ambling through town is the love of your life? Hollywood is pathetic. I kept trying to care about these people and about the cliché'd housewife who agonizes over whether to leave her husband and her children and run off with a guy she just met. We love and romanticize what we don't have and take for granted what we do. --Especially since we only see their best side in the beginning, while trying to compare that with the reality in which we live. Hollywood loves and elevates the superficial and denigrates truth and reality. It's possible that the only way lovers like these could remain in love with such a fantasy is precisely because they never dealt with real life together. It might not have been so romantic. Maybe they would even have discovered that they weren't as compatible as they thought. Still, the mysterious man of the world ""that got away"" is what makes women cry. I'll tell you what I find romantic. The couple who has been through hell and back together and still get butterflies at the sight of one another.On top of all of that.......Streep is overrated in this. If that was an Italian accent, I wonder what Czechoslovakian sounds like.",The Bridges of Madison County
146,billiejm,Ummm...,2,13 August 2019,It's a movie about how it's okay to cheat on your spouse if you're bored in your marriage..,The Bridges of Madison County
147,billiejm,It's okay to cheat on your spouse if you're a woman and board.,2,17 September 2019,I grew up on a farm in Minnesota with basically the same dynamic that this family had. I remember my mother getting this movie on cassette in the late 90s and she said that it was her favorite movie. I finally watched this movie in my early teens and I couldn't believe that this was one of my mother's favorites. The husband takes the kids with him for 4 days to do something that benefits the family and some random stranger with a camera entices Meryl streep's character somehow. I get that the woman felt empty and what not but damn.... I understand that people fall out of love but that doesn't make it okay to cheat. From what I could see the husband was a good guy and look I get it was the 60s and divorce was pretty taboo especially in the more rural areas of America at this time but having an affair was just as bad. She had other options... Sorry. When the husband was on his deathbed he looked at Meryl Streep and said basically I'm sorry I couldn't give you the life that you wanted. The guy really did love her but poor Meryl Streep had the soldier through a relationship where she didn't even love the guy... Boohoo poor Meryl Streep. I would like to also point out that if Clint Eastwood played the father that stayed home and then cheated on his wife with some photographer lady he would be chastised for it (by the audience) but for some reason it's okay when it's Meryl Streep and or female that's doing the cheating... even though I didn't like the movie for these reasons that's probably why a lot of other people actually like it. I just don't like double standards and I don't like the message that this sends out about relationships in general. Oh and about my mother... after I watched this movie I asked her if she had ever cheated on my father and she became extremely awkward and red-faced and changed the subject. so that was an awesome feeling..,The Bridges of Madison County
148,benjamyn47,Streep is amazing...,9,20 November 2000,"My girlfriend made me watch this movie with her and I am very glad she did. Not only was I incredibly moved, but I discovered the brilliance Meryl Streep has when developing a character.  Her fine acting is nothing less than stunning even if only facial expressions.  I knew what she was thinking the entire movie.  Clint Eastwood does a good job, but some parts seemed strange for him, perhaps because I am used to his western usuals.  At any rate, this movie is a great one to see for all of the feeling put into it.",The Bridges of Madison County
149,nodialogue,intensity of the moment,9,4 May 2009,"This is the only film ever that made me cut a telephone call short for I would not want to stop the film. It is a romantic movie that restricts the technical film-making to the minimum preserving the intimacy of the scenes. The two lead actors, Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood both have the ability to leave it to their gestures and faces to create the intensity of the moment, make the viewer feel the inner action. Consequently the outstanding scene, shot in a car waiting at a red light, needs no talking, pure moving pictures. Almost with every scene the film makes you believe that what you see will happen now, cannot be missed and will be gone forever with the next frame. The drama is presented as one big flashback from the children's perspective. One may argue that this destroys the viewer's perspective and excitement now and then. However it does make the point that this is a once-in-a-lifetime story, there is an end to it.",The Bridges of Madison County
150,escapoholic,Grown up romance in Iowa,10,11 December 2011,"This movie is good enough that even with multiple viewings, knowing what's going to happen, I'm choked up at the off-mentioned scene in the rain near the end.As noted elsewhere, the framing device of the adult children finding and reading Francesca's memoir doesn't work; their scenes are pedestrian at best. Even with this significant flaw, I consider BoMC a great movie. Think of coming across a Vermeer with a U-frame-it. The more you look at the actual painting, the less the frame matters. BoMC is almost that good.Robert and Francesca chance to meet in front of her farmhouse, as Robert has gotten lost looking for Roseman Bridge. Both are long settled into lives that make this meeting stupendously unlikely; he's a globe-trotting photographer and she's been in this house tending her family for nearly 20 years, although she hails from Baro, Italy, making her being there that way at all unlikely to begin with. She's been listening to opera beating dust out of a rug while husband and kids are off showing a prize steer at the Illinois state fair, where they'll be for four days.The two of them are in for a life changing relationship, although it seems at first like nothing more than a small detour for him and a break in the routine for her. They gradually awaken in each other dormant longings for a different kind of life than what they have. At the end of the four days, they are torn, and the movie works because we're torn with them.They have quite a lot to say to each other, but there's more than enough room for the dialog within the farmhouse kitchen, the exteriors around the bridge and the honky tonk joint they venture to on Wednesday, within the score and the Johnny Hartman love songs. (Who knew that old style radio with tubes in it could sound so good?!) Susan Sarandon (in Dead Man Walking) is the answer to who got the Oscar Streep should have won for her performance here, but she needed Eastwood to play against for that performance to have had the resonance it has. When Robert says he's not really an artist, I feel like he's speaking for Eastwood, telling us what he really would like to be but doubts he has the stuff for, although there's artistry there that Francesca connects with. In any event, without Eastwood's physicality, Francesca/Streep's transformation wouldn't make sense. Eastwood's acting is sometimes harshly judged, but I see him here fully inhabiting the character of Robert, perhaps because it's similar to his own.Forty years ago or more everything was ""poignant,"" to the point where the word was a cliché, but the word fits BoMC and the relationship between Robert and Francesca like none that I've ever seen in any other movie. The screenplay, the actors, the cinematography, and the score all work together.Many reviewers have objected to the movie's portrayal of infidelity, some so upset that it seems they've overlooked that this is a work of fiction. I could better understand the objections if Robert and Francesca's affair had a happy ending or was seen to have no consequences. Neither of these is the case here; both Robert and Francesca, having tasted the forbidden fruit, will never recover their previously settled lives, will forever experience a sense of loss. Meanwhile, Francesca's family will never know that anything happened, except that Richard expresses regret on his deathbed that he couldn't fulfill Francesca's dream, a scene that didn't ring true for me.Look at it this way: the book upon which this movie is based was wildly popular in spite of its prose being almost universally reviled by everyone with any pretension at all of literary taste. Were these many readers attracted by the opportunity to be offended by a tawdry affair? Isn't it more likely that there's much appeal from a story of unexamined lives, unrealized potential, the road not taken, of an exploration of what love is really about, even when the story is poorly written?In the end, I think the portrayal of what imperfect people might do seemed real enough to be upsetting to viewers who would prefer to see good people doing good things and being rewarded and bad people doing bad things and being punished. There are movies for these people, and to be sure, Bridges of Madison County isn't one of them, which makes it more interesting for the rest of us.",The Bridges of Madison County

Robert sits in his truck, waiting for Francesca (sitting next to her husband in the truck behind him) to come to him and leave together. She wants to, but cannot. She firmly holds the door handle, pushing it to almost unlock while her doubts are tearing her apart. Robert lingers at the now already green light to buy her time.

Everything about this film is stunning. Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are magical together. It's not often for me that someone eclipses Eastwood when playing opposite him in a roll but Streep does. It is an injustice that she did not get the Oscar she was nominated for. Then there is the direction which again proves that Eastwood is one of the greatest filmmakers period. Everything about it is beautiful! I am not afraid to admit that there were several moments in the film where tears were welling in my eyes.

And this movie is emblematic of that. The movie is so desperate to have us rationalize in the same way that the adult children (audience surrogates) are shown to eventually see what a wonderful thing it was that their mother cheated on their dad.Sorry, boomers.

Having never heard of this movie before, I was pretty sceptical after reading the write up, but I figured Meryl Streep is usually fantastic, so I decided to watch. And I'm so glad that I did! Such a beautiful film, brilliantly acted. When you consider that the focus is on only two characters for the large proportion of the film, it is incredible that this does not become monotonous or repetitive in any way.What really got me was the intensity of the relationship that the two actors managed to portray, it is very emotional and very real. I was very impressed by Clint Eastwood. Would never have imagined him pulling off a role such as this, but he was fantastic. I personally love the scene where they are in the kitchen dancing. There are hardly any words exchanged throughout this entire scene, but that did not seem to matter, it was just such a beautiful part of the film. The whole thing is a very much a reflection of the normal way in which a relationship develops. No grand gestures, no over the top displays of affection as is common place when relationships are being developed in films. It is just quite simply two people who are drawn to each other in an intense way. I won't spoil the ending, but it had me in tears.Fantastic acting and a beautiful script. Definitely worth a watch!",The Bridges of Madison County
166,mackiedoodlewilson,"A simple, beautiful story",10,15 February 2009,"I was speaking to a friend about relationships and she made a comment about this film some months ago. I found it whilst channel hopping on Channel 4 and recorded it on my sky+ box. I watched it yesterday and have to admit that I cried. I rarely watch a film and not move throughout it but I did with this one. I urge anyone that hasn't seen it to watch it, the love story that comes from it is beautiful and Meryl Streep's performance is so awesome, she draws you into the story and keeps you there until the very end. My favourite scenes are those in the kitchen when she is preparing the meal for her family, her mannerisms, her eyes and her expressions are all fabulous. "" I couldn't wait for them to leave"". My emotions ran away with me when the affair ends and she sees Robert Kincaid whilst out with her husband, I was wishing and praying that she would open the car door and run away with him into the sunset. I would recommend this film to anyone. It's become one of my all time favourites.",The Bridges of Madison County

170,veetz-1,A love story for a mature audience,10,12 July 2006,"This is a love story that unfolds from a letter addressed to the two surviving children of a mother who accidentally met a man who was lost. The letter was to be read by the children upon the death of the mother with instructions regarding what was to be done with her remains.The man was a National Geographic photographer who was trying to find a particular covered bridge. The man stops in front of a farmhouse and merely asks directions to the bridge. The woman finds it easier to show the man how to get to the bridge than explain the directions.While together at the bridge the woman finds this man quite different from any other that she has ever met. The man, while in the midst of photographing the bridge, is also captivated with the woman. At first neither make any advances toward each other that would cause them to enter into a romantic relationship.After the episode at the bridge, the woman offers the man a glass of iced tea which is gladly accepted during the hot summer day. During the conversation at the kitchen table in the farmhouse the two begin to become more involved with each other by exchanging background information. The result is a very deep emotional bond between two people who would never have met under ordinary circumstances. So they took advantage of the time they had together knowing within themselves that an opportunity such as this may never happen again.In a gentle presentation the audience is guided through the entire story from a chance meeting to a final resting place for two people who never stopped loving each other. The letter addressed to the children fully explains that this is not a sordid love affair or any act of betrayal. It is a story about a mother who still remained faithful to her immediate family but fell very much in love with a man who had a different lifestyle to offer her.",The Bridges of Madison County

Of course you can be with someone for a very short time and love them for ever.Clint was really amazing and understated in his performance. There are moment when so much is said with out words, I find that pure magical. The setting is awesome. The music which is actually composed by Clint is top class.

It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories.Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit.To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.",The Bridges of Madison County

The movie presents adultery in a realistic light. The viewer understands Francesca's actions and sympathizes with the difficult situation she finds herself in. In the end, we are heartbroken for her but also for her husband. The point of view of both sides is given and it's easy to sympathize with both. This movie made me cry more than any other and I still love watching it after countless times.

This was a woman who was married to a perfectly decent guy and who had kids. She cheated on her husband. End of story. Cheating is no romance, no matter the ""sweetness"" in which it is couched. I don't care about the cinematography, I don't care about the covered bridges (and the cinematography and scenery were very nice, it's just not the point). Cheating on your husband is just NOT romantic. And staying with your husband and kids is no great sacrifice. This movie disgusted me.

And Meryl and Clint's performances are marvelous! Also, the direction is wonderful. I'm always disagree with the adultery, but this movie is well based on its actions. By the way, sorry for my bad English (My natural language is the Spanish). I really enjoyed this picture, it takes my heart and hug my soul. A very big congratulations for Master Eastwood, for me one, of the best 20 directors on history, and also, a very good actor. And, Meryl Streep, my favorite actress, is absolutely awesome in her role. This is a REAL romantic movie, very different to others romantic movies like Casablanca (A great movie, a perfect ten thanks to it perfect screenplay, direction, acing, etc... but I don't like the plot, I think it's tawdry, unreal) :)",The Bridges of Madison County
177,galijasevic-50614,Low reviews boil down to wrong perspective,9,28 September 2019,"The angry, franticly composed reviews proclaiming this movie a glorification of a sordid sin are probably all written by the richards of the world. By the people who live boring lives and care little for pleasing their spouses and see this love story as a personal assault on the structure of their lives, and their very definition of love. Possibly making them feel insecure in their own relationships and their roles in them. *Sips tea*
The francescas of the world will see this story for what it is- fate's gift of a short and sweet love and a heartwarming lifelong memory to a woman who gave up her life and dreams to build a family and please others. Had she abandoned her family for a stranger my opinion would waver slightly ( i still believe everyone deserves happiness and shouldn't miss a chance to reach it)

This incredibly poorly written and deathly slow show with zero plot is a disgrace to Eastwood's normally good movies. Honestly, this is the first time in my life that I picked up the remote and fast forwarded through parts of a first-time-watched movie. It went that slow.

One that made you believe a world traveling photographer would fall instantly in love with a farm wife...

188,taigersden,4 days can change your life,10,18 September 2006,"This movie was a lesson for me. I've read all the reports about this movie, I agree with some and disagree about others. Have you ever come across a person, start talking to them, and all the while you're listening to them you feel as though you've known that person all your life? Many would call that an old soul. Some put that in the reincarnation bit which I don't believe in. I put that into these words. That person is your better half. If that person is of the opposite sex, and you were given the opportunity to have four days with them, what would those four days be? The time or moment that changed your life? Your fork in the bend? I believe in passion and love at first sight. Very few get to experience that kind of passion because most chose what is safe. Most people settle for what they know and what they can handle. Francesca did. The lesson in that movie for me was ... don't settle. Love is too special and worth it all. At the end of your life, when you have to look back on it all, its better to say I took a chance and look at what I got even if it was but for a short moment then to say what if .....Love may hurt more than anything else in this world ... but love can also be the most beautiful thing you will ever experience.

There is only one little detail that could be improved...HIM...a younger one... don't you agree? I mean Clint E. is okay but she found him so erotic..and I think he doesn't fit that image. I think that most of us women in our late 30s and early 40s dream of having such an experience!!! the part of the movie that makes me cry is when she is in the car with her husband and her lover is waiting for her decision to follow him. But she decides not to because she is afraid of many things...the first one to stop loving him when faced with reality...losing her family. Something else is that I think that those diaries were too many to write her experiences of only 4 days. I would have loved a scene at the end of the movie with Clint and Meryl holding hands for eternity and her husband joyfully watching them.,The Bridges of Madison County

The Dirty Harry/Bad boy of movies. It put me to sleep at first because it was so slow. But when I put it on for the second time because I had to watch it for the project.I have to say it was a wonderful story of two people who meet for the first time and fall in love. After the story unfolds you start to understand why Meryl Streep ( Francesca Johnson )has to pick from her family or Clint Eastwood (Robert Kincaid )a photographer for the National Geograpic how she fall in love with.

I was fortunate enough to have been a part of that class. He was leaving teaching for a ""special project"". Little did I know, it turned out to be the book that later turned into a movie.The similarities between Robert Kincaid and Mr. Waller are many. Mr. Waller was a photographer and a musician with a way about him that I have yet to see again in my 51 years, so similar to the character in the movie. He was those things in addition to being a business consultant and college professor with notable accomplishments. Some of my fondest memories from class were not only his lessons, but also being able to enjoy classes where he shared his photography and music.When I graduated from college, I was given a questionnaire to fill out. One of the questions was along the lines of something that I would never change about my college experience. My response was how fortunate I was to attend Mr. Waller's class and how I had hoped he would not leave. Alas, he went on to further success.I watched the movie last night with my wife, who had not seen it yet. I was flooded with many wonderful memories of Mr. Waller along with a good friend of mine that played in the band in the road house scene.

Eastwood plays his role straight and the dynamic between the two is perfect, Streep brings the best out of him.Unless you are a corpse it's almost impossible to control your emotions throughout this film, if you have any empathy with the characters by the end you will be crying your eyes out.

201,denzilroy,Shades of love,8,13 April 2013,"The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures.Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down.Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another.Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships?I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.",The Bridges of Madison County

There isn't that many movies that do that to me believe me. I was crying uncontrollably. Acutually OUTLOUD if you can believe that. It was gut wrenching. I was sure she was gonna go with him when she was in town and she saw him. I have always been a big Clint fan but he did an awesome job on this one. One of the best movie i ever seen. To me it's a reality movie. Back in those days that happened a lot women were comfortable at home they felt safe there it was hard for them to just pick up and leave.

My favorite part of the movie was when Robert was leaving and the two cars were staying at the lamps one behind the other...it was a very touching scene,I think.

This was a beautiful love story about sacrifice and love. I thought the other story-line with her children was the true message of the movie. I felt is was more of a realization film rather than a love story. I thought that Clint's acting was very dry, as usual. I didn't fell the energy or get the chemistry. I didn't like Meryl's accent, a bit phony. I thought the movie was a bit slow. It seemed like the relationship was a passing, exciting, fun fling, not a true love.

I had this person only a short amount of time, and when it came to an end my world of course had to move on, but the time we had left an impact on my heart, although years later those imprints are still there. Right after this happened, my friends bought me the book on tape, knowing at the time they could never convince me to read the book. I appreciatively took the tapes and a few days later slide the first into the tape player. I was immediately amidst the beautiful relationship that happened between these unique beautiful people. I couldn't stop listening, and stayed up an entire night, letting the novel flow through my ears. I laughed and I of course cried. I have read the book numerous times now, it sets above me on the shelf and I still read it from time to time. Seeing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised, Hollywood had not destroyed the novel, like many books are destroyed. Although the movie had been changed a bit, it was still moving and conveyed the sentiment and the beautiful relationship that Fran. and Robert. I cried tears at the theater like I had never cried before for any other movie. I can't count the number of times I have seen the movie to date, I don't watch it daily, or monthly, but from time to time, I need to feel what I feel when I watch it. I can never believe how I get sucked into the movie time and time again, and without a beat I cry and truly wish she'd open the truck door and run to Robert. Yet, I completely understand, sometimes...sometimes...true love has to wait, b/c life often steps in the way.I realize that many find this movie about an affair that should have never happened, about an unfaithful wife. However, in life, sometimes things happen, which, as hard as it truly is to understand you just cannot control. I believe it was probably one of the few times in Fran. life that she was true to herself. Many may find that selfish. But as the movie says, ""love like this comes but once in a lifetime."" Many and most people people will never find the true love that was conveyed in this film, and often enough, when you find it, it's truly not yours to keep, but it is nice to have, at least for awhile, I for one can attest to that. The movie is beautiful and I feel that Meryl and Clint were perfect and convincing for the roles they played.",The Bridges of Madison County

212,shubphotons,One again the Cool dude takes the babe,7,20 June 2015,"Okay, now this movie forces me to rethink upon an issue that has been troubling me for a long time now. If you married young and have a life and kids and everything, the popular culture portrays it as a failure to live your life completely. Let's get to the movie before I elaborate. Enter Francesca Johnson an Italian war bride who is married to a hardworking, honest, down to soil farmer who loves her but as usual he has many other things to care about rather than serenading his wife all the time. The husband takes the two kids off to Illinois Country fair and Francesa declines the invitation to come along. Enter Robert Kincaid, a dashing devil may care, rangy, cowboy photographer. He's intense he loves his job and roams the world like a free wind. No tangles no relations to hold him down. And obviously Francesca stumbles hopelessly in love with him. Now my point is lady, that guy is like the text book definition of a cool guy he's charming and he has these philosophies and ideas and all this is very appealing to Francesca. But we must keep in mind a passionate 4 day affair is easy a life time of camaraderie and support is another. I hate this idea that it's bad to just be with one person and boring means your life has amounted to nothing. I believe this ideology has increased unhappiness and occurrences of unfaithfulness. Cool kids are fine but they don't stick around. We need to glorify the silent real men who stick through till the bitter end. That's all I have to say. Movie is okay but the idea ruins it for me, although it does have a nice description of the bucolic life. It's a cinematic equivalent of American pastoral.",The Bridges of Madison County
213,kpilie,Too hard to watch(spoiler),10,19 September 2006,"This film is not for women who realize their life is no longer their's.This movie is not for women who realize the man they married is not who he seemed to be and their life together is an endless cycle of mundane tasks and agonizing routines.It is not unimaginable that someone could have a moment of clarity and realize in just four days how unfulfilled they really are.In Francesca's case it took this man out of nowhere to make her realize this.It was a cruel twist of fate.Her soul mate appears out of nowhere and she is left with an impossible choice.Had she not been a woman of integrity, she would have left her family.She was a mother and in the end her allegiance was with her children.How painful the rest of her life must have been.I imagine her sitting on the porch on summer nights thinking of Robert Kincaid ,her heart empty and yet full of sorrow.Watching him drive away,watching her dreams drive away with him.It's too much too bear.The saddest part of all is that only on his deathbed could her husband acknowledge her disappointments about her life,and that she really did want so much more.",The Bridges of Madison County
214,kdrown,Bridges of Madison County,10,6 August 2005,"Hi there all;I have to start out by saying that I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood to begin with.There is not one of his movies that I did not like,but I think when it comes to Bridges of Madison County Clint Eastwood broke his own record.There is a lot of romance movies out there played over and over again until they are worn thin.I believe Bridges of Madison County Stands alone.It was a complete turn of adventure for Clint at that time I think as a director and a actor.I love the small town romance between small town folks (as myself) and big city people.The love,romance and heartache all felt as real as if you were feeling it yourself.Merle Streep played an amazing role of a small town wife and mother.Together they walked through the movie as they had been together there whole lives.I believe this movie is loved by millions because so many people can relate so closely to the situation they were in,(myself for one)hold very deep meaning for me.I rated Bridges of Madison County a 10 and would go above and beyond.Once again Clint and Merle out did themselves.I loved it.",The Bridges of Madison County

217,jcappy-2,Male= Muscles and Sex,6,2 September 2005,"This movie is so promising... a sensitive, intelligent, artistic male who will seem to bring friendship, affection, and the world to a world deprived mid-western mother/housewife. But said man's words, style, and genuineness begin to falter rather too quickly for comfort. Maybe it begins with that shower--our thin lover we find is also a very masculine, muscular heroic type male. And then his words become rather trite and at times out of character--in fact his character and his claim to being a special male show through. To cap it off this interlude of friendship, which at times is so compelling as friendship, and would make one of the most revolutionary of Hollywood movies if it stuck with this theme, simply reverts back to the sexual encounter formula. So what we are left with is her drama: should i leave with this new lover before hubby comes back from the fair, or stay put in a good, if somewhat limited, marriage--to a very reliable, and trustworthy male.After she makes her choice, there is a long, drawn out ending, which is so utterly commonplace that even the most involved viewer must wonder just what went wrong with this movie that it has to end with these sorry platitudes. My answer would be the shower scene--which is very much like a long haired man (our male here is described as a ""hippy"" by the towns folks) feeling the need to balance that off (or off the map) with a superman type torso. This is not a new man story, but rather a confirmation of the forever man who has sex with a woman and then goes off on his horse.",The Bridges of Madison County
218,mdorroh-71778,Meryl at her very best.,10,13 August 2021,"I love this movie. Meryl Streep is at her very best as the Italian housewife Francesca on an Iowa farm. Her husband and children ignore her and her deepest dreams have been unfulfilled. The family has gone to the fair, leaving her alone. By chance, she meets a roving photographer (Clint Eastwood) taking photos of the nearby bridges. She assists him and the have an immediate bond. They both find their soulmates but only have four days to be together until her family returns. What will she do? Leave? Stay? This movie reaches deeply into who we are as people and what we want. It is beautifully directed by Eastwood, and he centers wonderfully on Streep's Francesca, even though his performance is outstanding. It's a lovely , romantic film and a favorite.",The Bridges of Madison County
219,elaine44,Don't miss this one!,10,17 January 2007,"Meryl Streep,the best actress I have ever seen,is superb in this romantic movie classic. I loved her Italian accent,her hand movements and laughter is something that cannot be taught. She was born with acting ability. I loved her through out the movie.Clint Eastwood did an excellent job as director,and actor. He seemed to let Meryl do most of the acting,because he knew(as I see it) that she was the one with the talent to hold an audience until the movie is over. I have watched the movie many times ,and each time I find something I never noticed in previous viewing's.Her children,in the early years,and in the later years were very impressive also.",The Bridges of Madison County
