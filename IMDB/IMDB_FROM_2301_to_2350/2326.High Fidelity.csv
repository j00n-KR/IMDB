0,SnoopyStyle,humorous,8,15 November 2015,"Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is broken up after his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) leaves him. He's in his 30s and owns a specialty record store in a bad neighborhood. Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black) are his weird snobbish employees. Rob recalls the list of his great loves lost. He has to grow up if he's to get Laura back.Along with their encyclopedic knowledge of music, these are some crazy characters. Director Stephen Frears is able to infuse them with likability. It's slyly humorous. Jack Black almost steals the movie with Todd Louiso as his perfect foil. Iben Hjejle has a maturity with a hint of a wild youth. It's also imminently rewatchable.",High Fidelity
1,Horst_In_Translation,Didn't keep me interested,4,24 June 2015,"Here we have a British/American movie from 15 years ago, which runs for roughly 110 minutes. It is directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen""), who also made the wonderful ""Philomena"" a while ago, but somehow his effort here did not appeal to me very much. One major reason may be John Cusack. He seems a likable fellow, but as an actor I just don't think he is particularly talented. When he was very young, in his early 20s or so, I remember people thought he would be a real superstar one day, but not really. This film was made in 2000, but somehow, maybe also because of Cusack, it comes off as a lot older to me, maybe because all of the references about music, mostly older music. Another thing that did not appeal to me was Jack Black's character. He came off as extremely unlikeable and I totally cannot see why the main character would want to be his friend. He seems arrogant, self-righteous and totally looks down on everybody around him. And the worst: We are even supposed to like him with his performance near the end. Louiso's character on the other hand was the exact opposite: shy and not confident at all and it was nice to see him get a girlfriend.Another thing that did not appeal to me at all was Cusack's character constantly breaking the fourth wall here. I am generally not a fan of this technique, but here it became fairly annoying really. I mean he always gives off this vibe that we totally want to know what was going on with his relationships and the people in his life, but honestly I found all the characters in this movie so dull and unappealing for the most part that I just wasn't interested at all. The performances were pretty forgettable too, especially Black's, but I guess it's not really his fault as he was written that way probably. It just did not fit in my opinion. The central female character is played by Iben Hjejle and her portrayal also wasn't memorable at all. There's a reason why her Hollywood movie times have been a thing of the past for a long time now. I found this a very forgettable effort from everybody involved. Not recommended, unless you really are a huge music geek. Then all those references about records and songs will maybe make it bearable for you. But everybody who isn't should better stay away.",High Fidelity
2,classicsoncall,"""All right, we have a 9% chance of getting back together.""",7,8 May 2018,"Well, I don't know. The further one goes back on the IMDb 'Top 250' lists, the quality of pictures that made it seems to get weaker and weaker, and here's an example. ""High Fidelity"" was at #205 in the year 2000 when it first came out, dropping to #241 the following year. That it doesn't appear again since should not surprise discerning movie watchers. It's entertaining enough if stuff like this is your thing, but really, should a twelve year old that you made out with once for a total of six hours over the course of three days be on your Top Five All-Time Break Up List? By the end of the story, you'll more than realize that Rob Gordon (John Cusack) seriously needs to get a life. But by that time, you'll probably be bored to tears over his incessant barrage on the fourth wall of your viewing screen. I will say I got a kick out of Jack Black's character Barry, the snobbishly arrogant music fan who works at Rob's 'Championship Vinyl' record shop. The same with Dick (Todd Louiso), but come to think of it, do you think they collected a paycheck there? I tend to doubt it, as most of the time, it was only the three of them in the store at any given time. And this is the only time I've ever seen Lisa Bonet as an adult after all those years as Cliff Huxtable's daughter on 'The Cosby Show'. So that was a surprise, and a very good looking one too. The one thing I'll agree with though is that ""Books, records, films..., these things matter"", otherwise I wouldn't be posting reviews here on IMDb. But as a service to adults over say, the age of thirty, save yourself the frustration of sitting thought this picture. Chances are you lived through the angst of this story yourself already, and who needs to be reminded of all that? And if you have your own Top Five list of All-Time Break Ups, better chuck it before the wife or significant other find it, or you'll be talking to the TV yourself.",High Fidelity

Four, Jack Black. Three, Stiff Little Fingers. Two, John Cusack giving the best performance of his career, or at least since ""Say Anything"". One, the conversation about ""Evil Dead II"" and the word ""yet"". Honorable mention, Lisa Bonet not being completely annoying and almost actually likable.Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, ""Watching High Fidelity, I had the feeling I could walk out of the theater and meet the same people on the street — and want to, which is an even higher compliment"".",High Fidelity
4,lee_eisenberg,"to tell you the truth, I couldn't see why people thought that this movie was so great",5,27 May 2005,"Okay, I'll admit that ""High Fidelity"" had a neat soundtrack (I've never known a movie to use music by The Thirteenth Floor Elevators), but other than that, it didn't seem much different from other movies that I've seen. The story of record store owner Rob Gordon (John Cusack) and his various relationships doesn't really add much to the cinematic world.Some of the more interesting parts came from Jack Black, as Rob's co-owner Barry, and from Tim Robbins as Ian, a obnoxious man ""...with a Steven Seagal ponytail."" But like I said, the movie didn't really seem to offer anything new. While ""Cradle Will Rock"", Robbins' and Cusack's previous collaboration, was not as well regarded, I found it more interesting.",High Fidelity
5,jboothmillard,High Fidelity,7,10 August 2007,"If you have seen Alfie (1966), then you'll love this modernised version appealing to the millennial generation, from director Stephen Frears (Mrs. Henderson Presents, The Queen) based on the British novel by Nick Hornby. Golden Globe nominated John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a thirty-something record store owner who talks to the audience, and must face growing up. He is also a compulsive list maker, and the key one is his top five breakups, including the one he is on now. As he revisits all past girlfriends (memory or practically), and he discovers he built these exes into more than what they really are. He is even surprised he fell for most of them at all, this is especially evident with old college classmate Charlie Nicholson (Catherine Zeta-Jones). As he searches for other past partners to make a closure to that part of life, Rob struggles to get over the recent breakup of Laura (Iben Hjejle), who begins dating his former neighbour Ian 'Ray' Raymond (Tim Robbins), and he worries of them breaking up for good. It is when Laura's father dies, and she invites Rob to the funeral that they share a quick night of passion, and after a talk they try their relationship again. Now comfortable after talking to his old girlfriends the relationship begins in healthy form. The major setting of the film is Rob's failing record store with employees Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black in his breakthrough role, before the even better School of Rock) discussing mix-tapes, constructing top five lists and discussing their opinions on artists and music. This comes into the main story when Rob makes a record label, Top 5 Records (of course), he becomes a DJ, Barry's band (a hint to Tenacious D) plays to promote the label, and in the end Rob begins to make a new mix-tape for Laura. Also starring Lisa Bonet as Marie DeSalle, Joan Cusack (John's sister) as Liz, The Haunting's Lili Taylor as Sarah Kendrew, Joelle Carter as Penny Hardwick and Natasha Gregson Wagner as Caroline Fortis. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay. John Cusack was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Catherine Zeta-Jones was number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 39 on The 100 Worst Britons. Very good!",High Fidelity
6,rmax304823,Sorrows of Young Rob.,6,29 May 2016,"This has generally positive reviews and in fact it's not bad. More than anything else it brings Woody Allen's work to mind. Not his early flat-out comedies and not his late erratica but his midstream features like ""Manhattan."" John Cusack runs a Chicago shop full of old vinyl records and more recent CDs. He knows his way around pop music. Unfortunately he can't figure out a relational calculus when girls are involved. What we do is follow him through a series of full and partial affairs, all of which seem to puzzle, frustrate, and anger him.The style is really Woody Allen's. When a former lover tells Cusack that she's slept with her new boyfriend but they haven't ""done it"" yet, he agonizes over the particular meaning of the word ""yet."" He pummels his friends with questions about it. Does ""yet"" mean you haven't done it but you intend to do it in the future? In a Woody Allen movie this would be done in narration but the director here has Cusack breaking the fourth wall, directly addressing the camera and leaping with excitement or slumping with depression as he describes one contretemps after another.I could allow myself to be drawn in by some of his feelings -- that the girl is too classy, too good looking, for a schlub like me, even though I myself closely resemble the youthful Robert Redford. Why, just the other day a toothsome blond in the supermarket looked at me and swooned. At least I think it was a swoon. Can swoons follow an expression of utter horror? My understanding of his obsessions with post-Beatles pop music was a little forced because I think most of it stinks. True that one of Miles Davis' better albums is on display, but then some numbskull makes a sarcastic crack about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.On the whole, if you've enjoyed mid-stream Woody Allen, you should get a kick out of this character-driven story.",High Fidelity
7,moonspinner55,Familiar stuff,2,10 December 2001,"Record store owner doesn't so much pine for romance as he does reminisce over his many lost loves. Fun music shop scenes let down by unbearable boy-girl stuff. Smug and indifferent. And haven't we seen this John Cusack performance before? The ""Wayne's World"" record-album scene between Tia Carrere and Mike Myers was funnier than this entire film, although Jack Black gives it a real kick. I'm still not sure if Black is a carnal impersonator or a honest-to-God actor, but he seems to take great delight in winging it and he's entertaining. If indeed his actions were all scripted, then he's a force to be reckoned with. He can't set the pace for the entire movie however, and the Cusack stuff buries the enterprise under unfunny comedic pathos. *1/2 from ****",High Fidelity
8,blanche-2,a record store owner has women trouble,9,14 June 2013,"John Cusack stars in ""High Fidelity,"" a 2000 film directed by Stephen Frears and also featuring Jack Black, Iben Hjele, Todd Louiso, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack, and Lisa Bonet.High Fidelity is about a record store owner, Rob (Cusack) who expresses his thoughts verbally throughout the film. Those thoughts mainly have to do with his failed relationships. And there have been many.He's hilarious and totally obsessive. When his ex-girlfriend Laurie (Iben Hjele) tells him that she hasn't slept with his old upstairs neighbor and her new boyfriend Ian (Tim Robbins) yet, it drives him crazy. In the record store, he asks one of the guys who works for him, Barry (Black), ""If I told you I hadn't seen The Evil Dead yet, would you think I was going to?"" An argument ensues. ""But you have seen it,"" Barry says. ""I'm confused - why would you ask me if you were going to see a movie you've already seen twice?"" The scenes that take place in the record store between Rob, Barry, and Dick (Barry and Dick are part-timers who show up every day) and their top five lists are priceless.Eventually Rob's focus on his ex-girlfriends and his stalking of Laura and her new boyfriend Ian evolves into questions about his life and his level of commitment, not just to women, but to life itself.There's nothing new about men who fantasize about ideal relationships while they're in a real one, nothing new about men who can't make a commitment, but there's something so fresh about High Fidelity - the interesting characters, the music, and the wonderful acting.Jack Black nearly walks away with the film. He has some of the best dialogue, too, and I will only say, wait until the end of the movie. Though Todd Louiso has a less showier role, he's no less funny, and he's created a music nerdy type character, quiet but no less passionate.John Cusack is adorable as an exhausted, frustrated suitor, and it's understandable that Rob has attracted so many attractive women. Holding onto one is his problem. Iben Hjele as Laura, his last girlfriend, had something about her that reminded me of Scarlett Johansson, her mannerisms perhaps, but she was charming and did an excellent job. What can I say - everyone was good.Don't miss this, no matter what. A wonderful message about living your life instead of dreaming, and learning what's possible.",High Fidelity
9,Quinoa1984,A nice narrative comedy,9,14 April 2000,"High Fidelity is brought to screen by John Cusack (not only as star, but also as co-producer and writer) with some good taste.  He talks to the screen through most of the film about love's labors lost.  He goes through some bad relationships, then we see the romance kick in with his current date (Iben Hjejle).  Not all of this is funny though.  The humor comes with Cusack's employee's at his record store (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) which were pretty good at what they shouldn't do (not acting wise).  Black was my favorite character (besides Tim Robbins and his guru type of man) because he reminded me of a Jeff Anderson from Clerks.  Not the most terrific script, but some good acting and interesting scenes pull through.  A-",High Fidelity
10,michaelRokeefe,It's great to have a job you love. Rock on!,7,17 March 2001,"John Cusack plays the owner of a record store. The greatest sounds on vinyl in one shop. He has two part-time employees(Jack Black and Todd Louiso)that spend most of their time arguing about music or insulting the customers. Cusack is a little perplexed in an obsessive compulsive sort of way. His obsession is organizing things into a Top 5 list. Favorite ballads; rock tunes; break up songs; oh...the thing that really occupies his mind is his unsuccessful relationships, thus the Top 5 breakups.This is a wonderful movie. Not a real coming of age flick; but a movie about emotions and the fetish of most young men, to hold in your hands the music that you cherish. Each and every record has a personal story and meaning to the beholder.No argument, this fits into the Top 5 John Cusack movies. Jack Black is a scene stealer deluxe, especially in the finale. Also in the cast are Lisa Bonet, Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Iben Hjejle and Joan Cusack.",High Fidelity
11,hitchcockthelegend,What came first - the music or the misery?,9,6 July 2015,"High Fidelity is directed by Stephen Frears and adapted to screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg from the Nick Hornby novel. It stars Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle and Todd Louiso. Music is by Howard Shore and Cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.Record store owner and compulsive list-compiler Rob Gordon (Cusack), embark's upon a what does it all mean mission when his latest girlfriend leaves him.Cusack and Pink take Hornby's hugely popular novel and redirect it to Chicago, with joyous results. High Fidelity is a tale of human love and a love of music, a sort of battle of the sexes with a soundtrack of masculine life. Rob's voyage of self discovery is highly amusing, the trials and tribulations of relationships bringing out a number of scenes and scenarios that ring true, not just tickling the funny bones, but also tugging the heart and cradling the brain.Away from the doomed love angles it's the music threads that literally strike the chords. Rob and his two co-workers Barry (Black) & Dick (Louiso) worship music and continually indulge in making top 5 lists whilst bickering with sarcastic glee in the process. All three actors are superb, a trio of odd balls bouncing off of one and other with a zest that's infectious, though it's decidedly Cusack's show. A perpetual miserablist who addresses us the audience at frequent intervals, Rob in Cusack's hands garners sympathy, pity and laughs in equal measure.In the support slots is a ream of talent well in on the joke, beauties like Catherine Zeta-Jones (dropping F-Bombs like they are going out of fashion), Lisa Bonet & Joelle Carter are complimented by the comic skills of Joan Cusack, while Hjejle turns in a wily and womanly performance as the girlfriend who kicks starts Rob's search for meaning. Elsewhere the sight of Tim Robbins as a new age hippy type - with a black belt in martial arts - is so much fun it reminds of what a good comic actor he can be as well. As with Grosse Point Blank, another Cusack/Pink production, sound tracking is everything, and naturally given the setting of the story there is an abundance of classic tunes to delight in. All told it's a special movie, for all sexes and for all music lovers, but especially for anyone who has had relationship problems. Now what did come first, the music or the misery? Priceless. 9/10",High Fidelity
12,Theo Robertson,Saved By The Beta Band . Pronounced as Bee-Ta,6,14 July 2013,"I used to work with a bloke called Alan who used to torture me by bringing in his I-Pod and playing his favourite tracks which more often than not were of Radiohead . It's no exaggeration to say I had to sometimes endure ten hours of non stop Radiohead . Very occasionally by accident rather than design he'd play a track I might like such as Dirt by Death In Vegas . One day he played a track by an act I'd vaguely heard of called The Beta Band . I instantly stopped working as a track was played utterly and helplessly hypnotized by the beauty of the song . The song was Dry The Rain and became the soundtrack of what was an up and down job I had but mainly ups and every time I listen to Dry The Rain I'm reminded of very happy memories mainly of Alan's girlfriend Maria who I'd sometimes share a smile with , or a cigarette or if I was really lucky an existentialist conversation on the meaning of lifeThat's the problem adapting a book like Nick Hornby's HIGH FIDELITY . We're asked to empathise not only with a character on screen but also to remember our own life experience . You can read about it on the printed page and picture yourself in the protagonists place and that's the whole point . We are the surrogate protagonist . It's very difficult to do with on screen visual images that are patently not us especially when they look like John Cusack and speak with an American accentHIGH FIDELITY possibly isn't a novel that's unfilmable but having the character of Rob Gordon constantly break down the figurative fourth wall and address the audience is a risky venture . You'll probably quickly come to the conclusion that you'll love this or hate this and I afraid I didn't love this concept at all . Changing the setting from Britain to America doesn't do the story any favours since you're constantly distracted as to how Americans at the turn of the century are aware of obscure bands like Belle and Sebastian or perhaps even The Smiths . Director Stephen Frears is a Brit and it shows a little too much as he's under the impression that American record buyers of 2000 are the Anglophile music lovers of the 1980s which they certainly were not when this film was released or even when the original source novel was written . Ironically the film might have worked better with a director who was younger and American That said it was very nice hearing the criminally underrated The Beta Band get a name check and a snippet of Dry The Rain and if nothing else this makes the film worth watching . Of course even this dubious value is undermined by Rob referring to them as "" The bet-ah band "" which just goes to show even if an American knows their music they haven't a clue about the English language and one wonders how this atrocity of pronunciation slipped by the British director ?",High Fidelity
13,Hey_Sweden,"Sharp, funny, and appealing.",7,26 November 2019,"John Cusack is the star, and one of the screenwriters and co-producers, of this likeable adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel. At its core, it capably tells a good romantic story, and does a very amusing job at poking fun at people who lord their supposedly superior musical knowledge (and tastes) over others. It's got an attractive and endearing cast, and it naturally also has a non-stop, eclectic soundtrack.Cusack plays Rob, the neurotic owner of a record store that is far from prosperous. His employees are the timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and the far more brash Barry (Jack Black, who walks away with the film). After his longtime girlfriend Laura (charming Danish actress Iben Hjejle) dumps him for another man, it forces him to take stock and reflect on the major relationships - and break-ups - of his life.Cusack is typically engaging, although this viewer could have done without that over-used device of having the main character directly address the camera. The film itself, despite being a little overlong, has some good laughs. I cracked up when Rob fantasized possible reactions to the annoying Ian (an amusing Tim Robbins), including a scenario of him, Barry, and Dick beating the almighty hell out of him.Some intelligent and pointed dialogue is brought to life by this talented cast, with a steady parade of lovely ladies (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter) as the women who have caught Robs' eyes over the years. Rob himself is not too sympathetic for much of the running time, but then, that is the whole point as it takes a while to pinpoint himself as a common denominator, and have his eventual epiphany.Nice cameo by rock star Bruce Springsteen, too.Seven out of 10.",High Fidelity

15,lastliberal,I'm too tired not to be with you.,8,10 November 2007,"Up to this point, the best film that John Cusack has done, in my humble opinion, is gross Pointe Blank. It was a classic. This will be right up there with that film and I will watch it many times before I die.I could not imagine that Cusack and Jack Black could meld together and make a great movie, but they did. Black was just the right touch in the store. Now, don't get me wrong, I am not a music geek. I really don't care that much who wrote or performed a song. Music is just background. What I am saying is that you don't have to be a music geek to like a movie that takes place predominately in a record store.What was great was Cusack trying to figure out why he was a failure with women, especially Laura (Iben Hjejle). Hey, the guy lost Catherine Zeta-Jones. He needed to figure something out! It was funny, tender, and really worth my time.",High Fidelity
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Worth watching due to the narrative and the study of the male way of thinking,8,19 January 2005,"I had quite a few doubts about whether or not to see this film. First of all, Iben Hjejle is in it. No matter how international she thinks she's become, she's still Danish. I haven't seen that many of her films, but I've seen enough Danish films to back up following broad statement: Danes just can't act, in the majority of the cases. Second, no one I know who enjoy films have any clue as to whether or not it's worth watching. I'm talking about people who have seen even the least known 70's and 80's films and can describe what's good and bad about them. In detail. Third, this is a romance comedy. A romantic comedy. The genre of film that is without a doubt the easiest to make and mass-produce, because half of the worlds women go nuts over them and cry their eyeballs out, if there's at least one good-looking guy in it who doesn't portray a complete asshole. So, when I found this available for borrowing at the local library, I was uncertain at first, but eventually decided to check it out. I'm glad I did, though I wasn't too surprised by what I thought of Hjejle. I was surprised at how good this was for a romance comedy, though. I will make sure that my friends know that this is worth watching. I like how Cusack throughout the film addresses the camera and tells us exactly what he's thinking. Without any bull. He's entirely honest, and through this honesty, we feel connected to him. We feel what he feels and we understand why he feels this way. I doubt there is any other film that so perfectly describes how men feel about love and sex. We follow Cusack's character through a recounting of his Top Five worst breakups. First we get a brief retelling of the list, and then he delves into the list, as the film goes on, and he's in the middle of the last breakup on the list. The plot is very good, and has a fairly good pace, though I felt it moved both too slow and too fast at first, somehow. The acting is pretty much all good. No actors really surprised me. Hjejle was about as annoying as I had expected, albeit more tolerable than I had thought. Black was his typical annoying self. The characters are well-written and credible. I really enjoyed this film, and recognized just about everything about the way Cusack acted. Everything he did and most of what he said. The fantasy sequences, particularly the one where he fantasizes about what to do when he faces a guy he hates, are great stuff, something that every guy can relate to. As Cusack says in the interview featured on the DVD: what's great is that it reveals the dark sides of us, of our love lives and relationships. I recommend this very good film to anyone. Yes, anyone. If you can sit through two hours of, basically, a study of the common male's thinking, and you can enjoy a somewhat non-Hollywood movie, you should see this film. It's not the best out there, but I doubt there is or can be a better movie about this subject. 8/10",High Fidelity
17,anaconda-40658,High Praise for High Fidelity!,10,29 May 2015,"High Fidelity (2000): Dir: Stephen Frears / Cast: John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, Lisa Bonet: Wonderful film that examines reasons behind relationships. John Cusack works at a record store where he narrates his flawed relationships. He compares his top five breakups to popular music. He still loves Laura and struggles to win her back after she walks out on him. Cusack addresses the screen as he confronts past girlfriends to analyze what went wrong. Funny and observant masterpiece by director Stephen Frears with Cusack making intriguing references to pop culture. His past relationships were all unique and he even hooks up with a local musician thus convicting himself when cheating is addressed. Jack Black and Todd Louiso are scene stealing record store employees. Black is obnoxious yet performs in his own band. Louiso is quiet and reserved but romantically rewarded when met with a customer. Iben Hjejle plays Laura who is confused about her feelings. She is dating an older guy, which drives Cusack crazy within his analysis, but she also knows him better than anyone. Lisa Bonet is a great asset as a musician who enters the store and Cusack hooks up with her. The record store location adds character to the film, and the music only highlights the mood perfectly. Great film that urges viewers to examine relationships and make honest realizations. Score: 10 / 10",High Fidelity
18,HotToastyRag,Quirky dark romance,4,16 December 2017,"In one of the last classicly '90s films, High Fidelity, John Cusack stars as a classicly '90s hero: he's single in his thirties, doesn't know why, and wants more than anything to be in a relationship. Nowadays, that type of man doesn't really exist anymore; he got married in 2000.As John reflects on his past relationships, he talks to the audience and exposes them to his work and friends. He works at a record shop, and music is a huge part of his life, so if you can't really identify with him in his romantic troubles or his love of music, you will probably find the movie irritating and boring. As it is, I'm a '90s kid, but a little on the younger side, and I think I might have missed the core demographic of this movie by a few years. I'm not entranced by vinyl, and I tended to see the main character's shortcomings rather than his qualities.While nostalgia is a good reason to pick up this movie, you might also want to watch it for the supporting cast. Jack Black, Catherin Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lisa Bonet, Lili Taylor, Natasha Wagner, and Iben Hjejle all contribute to this colorful film in their own way. I didn't end up liking High Fidelity, but I don't usually like dark comedies or quirky romances.",High Fidelity
19,Wuchakk,Romantic head games become tedious,5,26 November 2016,"Released in 2000 and directed by Stephen Frears, ""High Fidelity"" is a romcom/dramedy starring John Cusack, as Rob, the owner of a Chicago record store, co-starring Jack Black and Todd Louiso as his two employees, Barry and Dick. When Rob's relationship with his live-in girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle) falls apart, he reflects on the five worst break-ups of his dozen years of dating. His past girlfriends are played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joelle Carter, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Tim Robbins appears as Rob's rival for Laura's affections while Joan Cusack is on hand as Laura's sister. Lisa Bonet plays a rocker chick, a passing fancy for Rob. Sara Gilbert has a bit part.What's interesting about ""High Fidelity"" is that it features the five general prototypes of guys' dating life: (1.) the first crush & kiss, (2.) adolescent urgency & loss of virginity, (3.) the hot babe out of his league, (4.) the rebound best friend & soul mate, and (5.) his one true love (maybe).If you've ever made a compilation tape for a babe and worked at a record store you might appreciate this film. You'll particularly like it if you favor romantic head games, which I find irritating and is the main reason I have mixed feelings about the film (speaking as a one-woman type of guy). Because of this, I had a hard time staying with it, although there's enough good in the movie to make it somewhat worthwhile. It's witty and you can tell the creators put a lot of thought into it, but Rob's mopey reflections as he constantly speaks to the camera get tedious after a while. Don't get me wrong, John pulls off the challenging lead role and does so convincingly; I just found his perpetually-smoking character uninteresting. As far as the soundtrack goes, the 90's pop rock struck me as mostly bland.Thankfully, there are several amusing moments. For instance, the scene where someone confronts Rob at the record store in the second half is laugh-out-loud funny, but Rob's relationship with Laura is decidedly Uninteresting; and Laura's emotional instability and indecisiveness become increasingly annoying (anyone who would marry such a relationally fickle person would have to be insane). Actually, most of Rob's romantic relationships become annoying although, like I said, there are amusing bits. Then there's Barry who arrogantly thinks his opinion on music is law; I kept hoping he'd get his teeth knocked in. On a positive note, the mental manipulations of Rob's unstable romantic life are offset by Dick, who shows the way to go.""Empire Records"" (1995) is the better movie simply because it doesn't go overboard with the dating/romance head games crap.The film runs 113 minutes and was shot in Chicago.GRADE: C",High Fidelity
20,The_Void,Top five romantic comedies of this decade so far - number 1...High Fidelity,10,10 January 2005,"Stephen Frears' analysis of one man's love life is a very personal tale of love, told by our hero; Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Despite being predominantly a tale about a love life, High Fidelity also finds time to be a very hip musical study, as well as integrating a fistful of hilarious lines and sequences. As mentioned, the film pans out from the perspective of Rob Gordon; an insecure young man that cant hold a relationship down and so embarks on a personal voyage of discovery to find out why he's doomed to be left. What follows is a journey through Gordon's 'top 5' break-up's, and present insecurities and through this a complete three dimensional portrait of the character is painted in front of the audience's eyes. The way the story is presented is dynamic and makes the film easy to like. Of course, the fact that it's carried by the charismatic John Cusack and features the awesome comedy talents of Jack Black doesn't exactly do it any harm either This film is a very different take on the classic romantic comedy as the humour is very potent, much more so than the easy humour that the genre usually leaves us with. The music in the film is mostly of the indie pop persuasion, but despite this; it gives it a distinct sense of cool, and puts the film at the 'cutting edge', so to speak. The film is excellently cast, but I don't think there is another actor in existence that could have played Rob Gordon like John Cusack does. He's believable in the role because he's good looking, but he also has that sort of self loathing atmosphere about himself, which is put to good use in this movie. Cusack has spent far too much time in the romantic comedy genre and it's a shame because his talents could be used well elsewhere, but here he makes the film his own and this is definitely one romantic comedy that I'm glad he did make.High Fidelity is a rare thing; a romantic comedy that is original, hilarious and quite touching all in one go. Rom-com's like this don't come around often and this is one that you will not want to miss!",High Fidelity
21,SimonJack,"Listless, pointless, and not entertaining",2,26 January 2017,"""High Fidelity"" may have some comedy, but in its raucous setting and turmoil, that gets lost. The fidelity here applies to faithfulness in relationships as well as the quality of music. The plot of Rob Gordon's five worst breakups (John Cussack) left me flat. Nor do I find much entertainment in these films in which the star or someone else talks to the camera between bits. It seems an easy and cheap way for writers to switch gears without having to challenge their brains for clever writing and creativity.I suppose some of a young generation who would know some of the music in this film might enjoy it. But, I have no proclivity toward the music. I watched this movie because I wanted to see how John Cussack's comedy was around 2000. This is quite empty. Jack Black is way overboard with his Barry Judd character. But, he's often overboard. Here he's just too loud and crass. The film rightly has an R rating. I can enjoy or appreciate R films if they have character and substance. But this film has neither. So, its profanity, cavalier portrayal of sex and abortion, and listless lives aren't entertaining. Even though a large number of viewers have rated this film, I suspect its appeal has been to a specific group of people. I don't think it will resonate with much of the population 20 or 30 years later, or beyond.The best humor is in the ironic title. Rob's character has been of such low or no fidelity in the past. Now he's jealous and hurt, so the tables turn.",High Fidelity
22,namashi_1,A Must Watch!,7,4 November 2010,"Based on the 1995 British novel of the same name by Nick Hornby, Stephen Frears directed 'High Fidelity' is a must watch for it's strange and interesting protagonist.'High Fidelity' tells the story of man caught in mid-life crisis. How he analyzes on what went wrong in the past, and how things haven't worked out for him, as per the expectations. The protagonist played superbly by John Cusack, is one of the most memorable film characters you'll watch. He's confused, strange, witty and interesting. One of the major reasons why this film works, is because of it's Hero.The Screenplay pays tribute to the novel it borrows from. Stephen Frears direction is top-notch. He captures all the emotions of it's characters with maturity. Seamus McGarvey's Cinematography is well-done.In the acting department, John Cusack gets a role of a lifetime and he performs superbly. He makes Rob Gordon, his character, one heck of a memorable guy. Iben Hjejle is excellent. Jack Black is genuinely lovable in his part. Same goes for Todd Louiso. Catherine Zeta-Jones is first-rate.

23,StevePulaski,A trip inside the crowded contents of the male psyche,8,10 January 2015,"Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a man stuck in a rut and that rut is one that occupies childlike sensibilities, an inability to adapt to change, and a lack of understanding, or effort to understand, the women in his life. Rob has yet to really come of age and has been stagnant in his ability to mature and grow up, sticking to what he knows in the most primal sense. He runs a record store with his friends Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), spending most of his days engaging in meaningless conversations about which musicians are better than other musicians, what records have a long-lasting impact over others, and so on, almost as if their musical elitism predated the kind you see in the same place where this film is set, Chicago.Rob has just gone through a breakup with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a woman he clearly cared about but had no idea how to act on his feelings in a way that pleased her in a significant manner. She was troubled by his childishness and he was unwilling to change for the better. Depressed and distraught, finally questioning what role he had to play in his breakups, Rob cycles through five of his old romantic partners to see if there's some sort of consistent screw-up he is faced with in all his relationships.High Fidelity works instantly because of Cusack's character and character acting abilities. He embodies Rob Gordon, who we grow to find likable at times, mostly thanks to his quick-witted mannerisms and ability to keep a conversation moving, and incorrigible at others, for his inability to realize that he is his own worst enemy. Cusack's ""cool guy"" approach to the material, complete with first-person narration and frequently employed witticisms, make him nonetheless an interesting protagonist because you can fault him and appreciate him for many reasons, but the main one is that he's human. Louiso and Black work well as the side characters here, in addition, particularly Luiso, who is given some of the funniest lines of the picture. Jack Black is your typical Jack Black character here, but ostensibly boasting more controlled chaos than outright chaos here (either that or his craziness gels well enough with Cusack's coolness that typical results aren't as blatant).Director Stephen Frears and the quartet of writers at hand here (Cusack himself, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and Scott Rosenberg) are commendable because they understand the way males think. If a woman goes through a breakup, as least from what I've seen from my female friends and based off knowledge from films I have seen, she often reevaluates herself, checking herself with her friends to see what could've possibly gone wrong and if she had anything to do with the relationship's demise. Men, from what I've seen from my male friends and other films I have seen, are almost too prideful for that sort of thing, rarely showing too much emotion and holding it in for a rainy day. We move on to hooking up, letting our feelings out to only our closest friends, and simply try to find another woman who will provide us not with the same kind of love but the same feelings as the previous gal did.Of course I'm speaking in rampant generalities here; the heart of my argument is that so is Frears and his writers. They're evaluating the character based on terms typical of the male psyche, and are effective in at least portraying a pragmatic situation for a character who has been through a plethora of rough breakups. High Fidelity also features the soundtrack from heaven to compliment our leads characters' musical elitism that works to bring life to a screenplay that could've either showed its worn qualities or lessened in impact over time. However, thanks to Cusack as the center of the film, complimented by two other effective actors, the film stands strong and offers us a glimpse into the mind of a male during one of the most vulnerable times in his life.Starring: John Cusack, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, and Iben Hejejle.

25,MovieAddict2016,One of the best of all comedies but also a very poignant study of male life,8,13 December 2004,"Having read the very good Nick Hornby novel of the same name I looked forward to ""High Fidelity"" quite a bit, but I never expected it to be as good as it is. This is easily one of the best comedies of all time for its laughs alone - but what separates it from other comedies (particularly new-age ones) is that it's a very poignant multi-layered tale that focuses, primarily, on males - and why we are as we are. Love, life, relationships, music, movies, hobbies, jobs, ticks, ups, downs - everything is here.It's to John Cusack's credit that he took a ""classic"" contemporary novel set in London and transposed it to Chicago - and it works just as well (if not better) than the British version. It shows what a universal story this actually is, if so many people from all over the world can appreciate it, no matter where it is set. What we lose here are the abbreviations such as ""mate,"" ""cos"" and other British expressions - but essentially the story is exactly the same, as is the character of Rob Gordon.Cusack proves his worth here and there isn't a single bad performance in this film, except perhaps for the love interest who tries to sport an American accent and it's quite uneven at times.Jack Black is fantastically funny and reveals once again why he's leagues ahead of other obese comedians like Chris Farley who merely relied on OTT acts and weight for laughs - Black, like John Candy, actually acts and so far in his career has turned out some really good films which is more than can be said for many of his competitors.The script has some very funny one-liners and movie/music in-jokes (I love the ""Evil Dead"" bit - ""Because it's so funny, and violent, it's got a kick-a$$ soundtrack...and it's so violent!"").But at the end of the day what really haunted me (so to speak) about this movie long after I had seen it was the fact that it DOES stay with you ages after the credits have stopped rolling. It's poignant and really spot-on in many regards - add that to a film full of flawless performances and great direction and clever ideas and one-liners and jokes, and you've got a top-notch comedic masterpiece that places ""High Fidelity"" in the top ranks of American (and British!) comedy - ""with,"" as the DVD back cover says, ""a bullet."" Highly recommended. 5/5",High Fidelity
26,Red-Barracuda,Excellent romantic-comedy about a musical obsessive,10,26 May 2014,"I remember reading Nick Hornby's novel 'High Fidelity' and laughing out loud an awful, awful lot. The characters were so well drawn and the comedy was right on the mark. I suppose I saw parts of myself in there I would have to admit. Although admittedly, while I did organise my CD collection alphabetically, I was never tempted to sort it biographically! The story in a nutshell centres on a mid-thirties music geek who slowly accepts his adult responsibilities, while never actually discarding his obsessions. It's obviously great fun for those with certain musical tastes, seeing as it features references to important alternative acts such as The Beta Band and Stereolab, amongst many others.But what elevates the film higher is, like the book, it has three dimensional characters that are believable and it has a strong romantic-comedy aspect. Like the very best rom-coms its observations about relationships are intelligent and the characters are ones we root for. John Cusack as the main character Rob is in fine form in a role where he is a sympathetic lead, a selfish idiot and an amusing music geek. It's a multi-layered performance. Iben Hjejle as his long suffering girlfriend Laura impresses a lot too. We completely understand why Rob wants her around but it's not hard to see why Laura has serious issues with their relationship. Hjejle, like Cusack, is given quite a lot to work with and her performance also has quite a bit of emotional range. The rest of the cast is very good too with Jack Black playing the ultimate obnoxious music snob, Tim Robbins is equally amusing as the even-tempered neighbour Ian, who briefly has a relationship with Laura much to Rob's horror, while Lisa Bonet and Catherine Zeta-Jones are also on hand as other women who come into Rob's orbit.Director Stephen Frears and producer Cusack have to be given a lot of credit for adapting Hornby's book to the screen so seamlessly. The novel is set in the UK but the movie is set in America. Some of the references have had to change accordingly but none of the amendments make any difference to the overall impact; in fact it makes it an interesting contrast if anything. My advice is simple - watch the film and read the book. You won't regret either.",High Fidelity
27,KineticSeoul,Jack Black is overrated,7,12 August 2013,"When I first saw this movie a long time ago I thought it was amazing. But watching it now, it's alright. Still a fun flick about coming in terms with oneself and relationships to a degree but nothing all that amazing. It's a overrated movie with overrated Jack Black. This is probably one of John Cusack's trademark movies and also launched Jack Black to overrated level for a short while. Although John Cusack was perfect for this role. The story is basically about a guy named Rob Gordon(John Cusack) that owns a record store, he critics records and people constantly. But mostly people while also being a hypocrite. He is this conceited, judgmental, critical, hypocritical, selfish jerk. And puts others down when he isn't going anywhere with his own life. In another words a difficult character to like, although some maybe able to relate with the guy. As a matter of fact some audiences actually like this character while admitting the guy is a jerk. Which can be understandable with some other movie characters but not really with this one for me. And during work time he is part of a trio in the record store. with only one of them being likable. Jack Black's character is one of the three trios and I don't know why audiences like this character of his. As this obnoxious, immature, crude and rude guy that works in a record store while forcing his opinions onto others. And he isn't even funny or interesting in my opinion. And this is the character that Jack Black is mostly known for. His character is like Lester Bangs from ""Almost Famous"" except annoying. The protagonist Rob Gordon coming in terms and getting over his inner demon aspect is cool and sometimes even interesting at times. While he meets up with his past girlfriends, each with different style and characteristics(Penny Hardwick being my favorite). But it seemed to be missing that flare that leaves something behind and didn't care much about the characters or what happens to them. This movie is just full of characters that are jerks, it's actually humorous and entertaining when they are jerks to each other though. Overall despite few annoying characters, it's still a enjoyable flick and you can tell the actors had fun making this.7.3/10",High Fidelity
28,sddavis63,A Guaranteed Cure For Insomnia,1,30 March 2001,"I have no idea what John Cusack was thinking, but his name is plastered all over this disaster: star, producer, writer. If I were him, I'd be afraid for my career: very afraid!Simply put, this story about the past and present romances of Rob Gordon (Cusack) is BORING! I can generally pay attention to any movie, no matter how bad. I desperately look for something nice to say about a movie - even the terrible ones. But this one? I fought, but at least three times I dozed off in the midst of it. It is supposed to be a comedy, and yet not once did even a modest chuckle escape from me; I'm not even sure I ever smiled at the lame attempts at humour. The movie is a little less than 2 hours in length, and yet it felt as if 6 hours had passed by before this thing finally ended.

It's also a pretty good movie about the difficulty of relationships. John Cusack is talented, funny, and likable as a record store owner floundering his way through breakups, mainly because as much as he's an expert on music, he's a dunce about women. He often talks directly to the camera, drifting back to memories and musing over various 'top five' lists.

It's a very realistic film that revolves around Rob Gordon, a character that I found very relatable, which I think is one of the strongest points of this movie, every performance is very honest and sincere, no one holds back and because of that it made the characters feel very life like, that's something I love to see in a movie. I think Rob is a great character, but the writers should have put in more time in to making us feel for him, the whole time watching it I honestly thought he was s jerk, and though I felt bad for the position he was in, I also felt like he deserved it, I'm sure that's what the writers wanted but to a certain degree they should have made him more likable. The cast is superb, John Cusack kills it in the lead role, he shines in both comedic and dramatic scenes, Iben Hjejle is also great in all her parts and Jack Black brings a lot of comic relief in to the movie in one of his first major roles. It may not be a feel good movie, but High Fidelity brings in great laughs and stellar performances, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy drama.A record store owner must try and reconcile his love of music with real life responsibilities.

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Why music, love and film belong together",8,18 December 2008,"There's always been an inexplicable connection between music, love and the movies. Certain songs always seem to set the tone for various kinds of love and romance in film, whether the light-hearted or the dramatic. ""High Fidelity"" not only uses the power of that emotional mixture, but also focuses on it and attempts to understand it. ""High Fidelity"" is the story of Rob (Cusack), a vinyl store owner, and his understanding of his most recent break up with Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) through analyzing his ""Top 5 worst break-ups."" Rob's affinity for music and being a self-proclaimed ""professional appreciator"" of music clearly influences his understanding of love and his quest for some kind of greater fulfillment.Written by a team of writers -- including Cusack himself -- and based on a novel by Nick Hornby, ""Fidelity"" takes on a first-person narrative structure, with most of the story being Rob talking directly into the camera. Normally narration is voiced over or kept distant from the action of a film, but this choice for ""Fidelity"" creates an intimate relationship between Rob and the audience. Part of this success is how natural Cusack takes to the part. You believe he's treated you as a close friend the entire time -- there's no lack of sincerity whatsoever. In general, it's a technique that works phenomenally for this movie because it's all about trying to make sense of love and seeing how music influences that interpretation. There are many people out there who strongly identify their emotions with music and those people will absolutely love this film. It is candid, witty, mature and it's dead-on when it comes to identifying with music appreciators. Not a lot of films really connect to audiences on this level. There's no glorifying of romance when all is said and done -- it's not overdone Hollywood style -- it's just honest and doesn't claim to know any more about love than any of its viewers.

38,Anonymous_Maxine,"This one really shocked me. I don't even like John Cusack, but I loved High Fidelity.",9,27 January 2001,"Why was High Fidelity so good? That's the question that has been going through my mind ever since I saw it. There really wasn't anyone spectacular involved with it. I mean, it's not like Tom Hanks was in it or Steven Spielberg directed it. But somehow, it ended up being just a great comedy.High Fidelity just had a really entertaining story, and it was extremely well acted by everyone involved. This is what I have come up with in my mission to find out what it was about High Fidelity that made me like it so much. Sure, there's not a whole lot to the story  a guy gets dumped and goes back and recounts his relationships and break-ups with his top five girlfriends, but it was presented in such a clever way that it made bland material a lot of fun. One of the things that was really good about High Fidelity was the way the `top five girlfriends' premise was complemented by Rob Gordon (Cusack) and his music geek friends coming up with countless top five lists. Top five dream jobs, top five first songs on music albums, top five this, top five that. Anyone who is into top five lists or top ten lists will probably love High Fidelity just for that small part of it. Speaking of Gordon's music geek friends, the person who really stole the show was Jack Black, as Barry, one of Gordon's employees at the record store that he owns in the film. This is particularly notable given the variety of unenviable roles that Black has played, such as those in Cable Guy and, more recently, The Jackal. The hilarious music discussion scenes that take place in the record store are probably the best scenes in the film, and Black steals nearly every one of them. Almost as amusing as Black was Todd Louiso, playing the part of Dick, another employee at Gordon's record store. Dick is a very soft-spoken music fanatic who is probably so entertaining because we've known someone like him. In fact, that's what is so appealing about Gordon and Barry, too. They are a cross-section of music fans in the urban world and they provide many more laughs because of their familiarity.  A number of well-known actors also played relatively small roles in High Fidelity, such as Catherine Zeta-Jones, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Joan Cusack, and, of course, Tim Robbins as the antagonistic new boyfriend.' One of the really good things about High Fidelity is that it eventually delivers a good message about stepping up and actually doing something with your life. It warns of the dangers of getting too comfortable doing one thing, and of giving in to the temptation of hopping from relationship to brief relationship. At the end, Rob begins to realize the mistakes that he made in his relationship with Laura, and these are mistakes that I think a lot of people have made and continue to make. High Fidelity is just good comedy. It's fun, it's entertaining, and above all, it's refreshing because of it's relative originality. There are plenty of memorable scenes in the film, many because of their sheer, if illogical, hilarity. Some of the customers who come into the record store are treated much worse than they would ever be treated in real life, but the laughs are delivered. Don't miss this one.",High Fidelity

Suited for guys who dig great indy music and girls...",8,19 December 2018,"Bruce Springsteen stars in this romantic comedy. Check it out! His small cameo must be enough to wanna check this movie out, because ""The Boss"" never acts in any movie, let alone in a romantic comedy. Why is he in it anyway? Because this movie is about the love for independent music. This movie is about all those music geeks who live for music. For whom music is the first thing on their mind when they wake up, besides thinking about girls ofcourse. That's why Bruce Springsteen lend himself for this original movie in a short and very funny cameo.Besides independent music the other topic of this upbeat and very original romantic comedy is breaking up with girls. An long list of failed relationships gets portrayed. And John Cusack who gets dumped by every girl he has ever dated, asks himself the question: why? Well, because he acts like an asshole who doesnt want to commit. He just cant be trusted, hence the wink in the title of this movie called ""High Fidelity"", referring to great sound quality, but also referring to great trustworthiness, which John Cusack unfortunately is lacking in.Feel good. Funny. Terrific music. And a fresh, original take on this old rom com genre.

41,drqshadow-reviews,Confessions of a Self-Obsessed Connoisseur,7,19 January 2012,"John Cusack routinely breaks the fourth wall in this portrayal of a sad sack record store owner going through a flustering mid-life crisis. Eccentric and clever at times, he's also a bit of a selfish, standoffish prick and that duality, combined with a stern lack of motivation to do something with himself, has long wreaked havoc with his love life. Very funny at moments and stretched thin at others, it's a wordy dissection of Generation X's slow, sad loss of touch with their adolescence and the lies we tell ourselves and our loved ones. Though angled and multi-dimensional, Cusack's character never turns the corner into someone worth rooting for, so his chase after a nearly-lost girlfriend lacks teeth. Good for some bright laughs, it lacks much depth beyond the satisfying validation of identifying a few cherished LPs from your own collection in the background.",High Fidelity
42,estebangonzalez10,One of Cusack's best performances to date.,8,6 August 2015,"""Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?""Stephen Frear's High Fidelity breaks the fourth wall from the very opening scene as Rob Gordon (John Cusack) begins sharing with us about his top 5 breakups right at the time his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), is moving out of his apartment and leaving him. It is evident he is hurt, but he brushes it off by saying she doesn't even rank in his list of the most hurtful breakups. That is when he begins listing who each one of them were while we get flashbacks of those memories intertwined with the present in which we are introduced to his job, friends, and his passion for music. Rob is a vintage record store owner and his two employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), are as much music snobs as he is, and they too enjoy making lists of their favorite things usually involving music. The more we get to know Rob, we realize that he isn't the typical romantic character we'd find in a film like this. He is deeply flawed, he has cheated on his girlfriend, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere with his life, and he is afraid of commitment. Somehow he always believes to be the victim in the break-ups, but from what he says we know that he has never been boyfriend of the year material. It is hard to root for a character like Rob, but John Cusack delivers such a charismatic and engaging performance that we accept his flaws and want him to get over the heartbreak. Along the way he realizes that Laura really belongs on the list and decides to revisit some of his past flames to discover what he has been doing wrong. Frears has directed some great films (The Queen, Philomena), along with not so good ones that feel like direct to TV movies, but High Fidelity belongs in his top list of best films. It is a romantic comedy that has an entertaining script, some great performances, and of course a wonderful soundtrack. The screenplay was adapted from Nick Horny's book but instead of setting the story in London they bring it to Chicago and it absolutely works. Jack Black and Todd Louiso give strong supporting performances and you believe they actually are these snobs who are living music encyclopedias. They complement Cusack's performance and deliver most of the comedic moments. As for John Cusack I believe this is one of his best performances although I still need to see a couple more of his films to solidify that claim. The romance in High Fidelity is also incredibly believable and relatable which is hard to come across by in most rom-coms. Neither Cusack nor Hjejle are portrayed as these perfect role models in a relationship, they are both flawed characters who have made some poor decisions.Even though my music knowledge is very limited, I was able to relate to these characters because of their shared passion. I may not have that same passion for music, but I do for movies or sports so I understood where these characters were coming from and believed the culture this film created surrounding music. The screenwriters knew what they were writing about and each one of the actors delivered, and that is what has made High Fidelity such a cult favorite for many teens. It manages to be smart and funny at the same time. It is also one of the best examples of a film successfully being able to break the fourth wall and including the audience in the genius of the movie and its charm. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",High Fidelity
43,juneebuggy,Cusack conquers the role,5,1 December 2014,"I loved how this was filmed so that John Cusack (Rob) talks to the camera/audience while going about his messed up life as that of a record store owner and compulsive list maker. He really pulls you into the movie this way and its kinda hilarious watching him suffer an (I don't want to grow up) pre mid-life crisis as he recounts his top five breakups,including the one in progress.I have to say though I actually preferred the book by Nick Hornby and I guess that's why I had a hard time with the Americanized version, I think this would have worked better had it taken place in England.Cusack conquers the role though and is thankfully not as depressing as his literary version. Jack Black stands out as his wacky clerk, as does Lisa Bonet and an American (and very beautiful) Catherine Zeta Jones. 07.13",High Fidelity
44,noralee,The Patron Movie of Music Lovers,10,19 December 2005,"High Fidelity is a laugh out loud movie for music cognoscenti.From the movie's snotty clerks (who are quite a bit like the clerks in the stores I frequent who though I give them a good chunk of my weekly pay check still look at me blankly or worse, are absolutely convinced I will not put rejects back in the right order, and sneer at my purchases until maybe twice a year do I earn some momentary approbation with an obscure selection) to John Cusack's ""Rob"" reordering his CD collection (gee I have mine in alpha order, well mostly, and still my husband complains he can't find anything. Maybe he'd prefer how this character chose to sort his CDs autobiographically, as in he'd find stuff from when we shared the same taste in music) to the loving explanation of what goes into making a compilation tape (has anyone else been as hurt as I when I spend hours doing a mix tape for a friend or relative and they either just don't get it or worse never listen?)--and here the girlfriend even gets what it means. Too bad Iben Hjejle isn't otherwise convincing in her role.Critics have pointed out how unusual that this is a relationship movie from a guy's viewpoint and even more interesting that both characters do change. I of course adored Cusack before this (it was ""Say Anything"" that convinced me that guys are in fact part of the human species though he didn't co-write that as he did with this though he didn't co-write of that as he did with this adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel I haven't read yet as well as pick the music) and I adore him grown-up even more.(originally written 4/19/2000)",High Fidelity
45,drystyx,no talent,1,22 June 2012,"This is dull. It's supposed to be a comedy, and you can see the actors try, but they look like people reading lines and doing what a director or writer tells them to do.It's very sad, and you could feel sorry for them if they were doing this on a small budget.However, this is a group of rich kids who make a movie, and don't have a thimbleful of talent between them. The script is dull, the directing is deplorable, and the acting is nonexistent.Most of the movie seems to be some grown up rich brat whining and griping about something. If you can stay awake long enough, you'll not find anything at all interesting about it.The lead actor is so bad, I won't even name him. He looks like someone who truly just memorized words to say on screen.Much of the fault is the director, who simply does every cliché he can think of, and has exactly zero ingenuity and zero creativity.Which brings us to the writers of the book and screenplay. I certainly won't bother reading the book, as dull as this is, so I won't affirm the book writer has no talent, but it would be hard to believe.The trouble here is that we live in a day and age when everyone thinks he is an artist and writer. Forty years ago, people knew what they were. Farmers could farm, welders could weld, and some people could do two or three things well.Today, people who should be farming or roofing are writing bland scripts. They are highly regarded only because they are competing solely against other rich kids who should be welding or gardening. The naturally talented and trained writers are the first casualties of the ""board room"" decisions, because everyone in the board room has a dull script, and they only want to compete against other dull scripts. They have to weed out the best ones first.This is why we get so few comedies that we can naturally laugh at today.Usually, it's only the writing that suffers in modern movie making. What makes this movie especially bad is that whomever did the casting had absolutely no clue. One gets the feeling the cast were all relatives and friends. I won't comment on the ones with small roles, because the movie is already ruined by the stars. This was incredibly amateur. I could find elementary school kids who could put on a better show.If you can stay awake through this, you are truly an Insomniac.",High Fidelity
46,alansabljakovic-39044,Be careful nerds are talking,8,12 June 2019,I freakin love John Cusack and this movie is like 500 days of summer but more amazing because it includes Jack Black and amazing music.,High Fidelity
47,slokes,Funniest relationship movie of the new millennium,9,3 November 2003,"Okay, I know more about movies than I do relationships, but if the latter are anywhere near as good as cracked up to be, ""High Fidelity"" would be a killer representation of the highs and lows of commitment, love, and tenderness circa the turn of the century. And it is. So there.This movie could have been a trap so easily. Self-absorbed Gen X losers whine about losing their perfectly toned girlfriends because they can't focus on how good they have it as they lounge on their Ikea sofas wired to their Bang & Olafson stereos smoking unfiltered Camels. Boo-hoo. But the central character rivets you in, sad-eyed and begging for your sympathy. John Cusack shows himself to have evolved into quite a professional actor, moving beyond the pleasing if callow roles of his youth with a performance that makes great use of his expressive eyes and his spot-on phrasing. The way he answers the phone the first time Laura calls his character Rob at Championship Vinyl, with the start, the stop, the door close, the pause for a puff of his cigarette, and then his matter-of-fact hello, without seeming to miss a beat. Very surface, yes, but in a practiced, disarming way that makes you feel left in, not out. He shines like that throughout; never too showy, just there when you notice it.As he explains his situation to the viewer in a series of personal narrations, he makes matter-of-fact lines breathe with the understatement of a Robert Benchley bon mot. More important, he reels the viewer in with the same sense of emphathetic desperation that Michael Caine employed in the similarly single-callow-guy-confessional-themed ""Alfie."" At times, you even think of Olivier in some of his juicier, more sinister confidences in ""Richard III."" You find yourself not liking Rob much of the time, but even at his lowest (whining about Laura's inevitable resolution with Ian after Rob just sampled the pleasures of Marie DeSalle) his confessonary character pushes such quibbles away.Cusack is the central performance, and I love Jack Black's star-making second-banana role as well as the many great cameos, from Tim Robbins to Sara Gilbert, but without even looking at all the people who wrote before me, I'm rashly predicting nearly all ignored Iben Hjejle. I don't know how to pronounce that either, except if we were in Copenhagen it would roll off our tongue like Julia Roberts. (The female lead, despite her excellent English, is from Denmark, and apparently went back there after just this one great role. We did manage to get rid of Brigit Neilsen after ""Cobra,"" too, but it still seems like the Danes got the best of the bargain.) Hjejle makes such an impression as Laura. From reading the screenplay, you might think of her as a bitch just given how she leaves poor Rob flat, but no. Instead, because of her careful line readings, the humble shafts of vulnerable humor she uses to (almost absently) puncture his bleak half-catatonia, and that glorious half-moon smile she shoots while simultaneously defensive and sincere, you really root for her and Rob to come together again, and because you do, the whole rest of the picture works. Hjejle puts over a delicate balancing act. Just imagine Shannon Doherty in the role instead. It's what I mean about the film avoiding the callow trap. You care too much about the people involved, and your caring invests the picture with the sort of meaning that elevates it to real art.Reading the book, one is impressed by how well the screenwriters did by not veering too far from the veddy British Nick Hornby's story. The four screen scribes (including Cusack) take nearly every cue Hornby gives them, starting with the Top Five list of women/girls who dumped the hero, capturing the record store in much of its written form (even with most of the same pop music references, as we've been on much the same page musically with the Mother Country since the Beatles went on Ed Sullivan). There's not much missing from the book, but since the book's such a fine tight read, and Hornby keeps the plot zipping along, that's a good thing. Still, if you enjoyed the movie, you won't be disappointed. The book fleshes out some things and amplifies others.Finally, the dialogue is so crisp and effective, funnier and snarkier than a season's worth of ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I love SNL. My favorite line this week is Dick describing Marie DeSalle: ""She's a little Sheryl Crowish, crossed with a post-Partridge Family, pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing, except, you know, black.""Where can I find a good Beta Band CD, anyway?",High Fidelity
48,ShootingShark,Familiar But Hip Chicago Thirtysomethings Romantic Comedy,5,12 June 2005,"After breaking up with his girl, thirty-something Rob, the owner of an indie record-store in Chicago, examines his failed relationships and decides that something's got to change.Based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel (though the action is relocated from London to Chicago), this is a well-made and sometimes witty love-story/comedy/drama. As ever, Cusack gives the movie all his energy (he also co-scripted and co-produced) and makes the non-committal loafer he plays a likable rogue. The rest of the cast are good too, particularly Louiso and Black as the two music-loving goofs that hang around the store, and there is a nifty cameo by Springsteen, as well as some funny moments and plenty of good songs on the soundtrack. However, the film never really comes to life for me; Cusack plays an identical role in several other movies, the drama is hardly inspiring and the constant direct-to-camera addresses annoy me. I hate direct-to-camera; when adapting a book with a lot of first-person perspective, I find narration much more emotive and much less intrusive. This is an entertaining movie, but it's a movie where nothing really happens and the images are pretty ordinary, and movies shouldn't be that way. I find it ironic that at one point this film pokes fun at The Big Chill for being a staid mid-life crisis drama, but when this movie is as old as that one, it will be equally dated.",High Fidelity
49,triple8,Underrated,8,28 February 2004,"This is a movie that I saw kind of accidentally but was very impressed by. I found it touching, funny and just very good-why is it so little known? It didn't remind me of ""reality bites"" as other people have stated, because this was much less ""hollywood"" then that. I kind of was reminded of ""clerks"" in an odd way. There were definite similarities and the characters had an excellent element of realism that I'm sure is the main appeal of the movie, many could view this and found parts of themselves, their relationships, and their friends in many of the characters. Add some great music and a record store setting to the mix and a great cast, and you've got all the ingredients for a really good picture.I didn't love when I first saw it, though I definitely liked it a lot. It seems the type of movie to definitely grow on you, when I see it a second time I have the feeling the movie will jump a couple of points. I have yet to see a John Cussac movie I don't like, he's as good here as he is in everything else he does. Movie definitely recommended for viewing.",High Fidelity
50,TheOneThatYouWanted,Very overrated,4,2 January 2021,"I think this was Jack Black's breakout role. When you're watching this film 20 years later in a world where Jack Black had his 15 minutes of fame and then some, you pretty much have immunity to Jack Black. So the rest of the film is average at best. The female lead is a cold fish and hurts her surroundings in more ways than should be allowed.",High Fidelity
51,Sandcooler,Didn't work for me,4,29 March 2010,"The main weakness to this movie is that John Cusack's character isn't very likable, which makes his relationship troubles rather uninteresting. He might find some luck, he might not, I don't really care. He's way too whiny to like, and the many occasions on which he talks directly to the camera are downright cringe-inducing. Allison married Kevin! I don't care dude. Leave me alone. Another thing that bothers me here is the unstoppable avalanche of pop culture references. Pretty much every band the writers like is mentioned in this movie, which comes of as pompous in a ""hey, check out the obscure stuff we know"" kind of way. They try their best at clever dialogue, but then bail on that and figure they can just play some Beta Band music. Generally when a movie has a cult status I can at least see why exactly that is, even if I don't like it. Here however, I'm just dumbfounded. I don't even remember half of it even though I've just seen it. Anyway, I sat through it because there are some good performances here and there, but there's little else I enjoyed.",High Fidelity
52,Matt_Layden,You Smell That? That's Nostalgic,7,20 July 2009,"Quick, if you could list your top 5 records, could you? I can't. John Cusack's character is asked the same question and he responds with, I'll make you a mix tape. In watching this film I can see how some people may see it and think that it is dated. I mean, records? Tape decks? Kids these days all have mp3 players, I'd be surprised if they even knew what a CD was. But these elements do not date this film, they enrich it, give it nostalgia.Don't be too quick to heap this film in with other so called music flicks like Empire Records, which is good in it's own right, but these are two different flicks. High Fidelity recounts the top 5 break-ups from Rob, who breaks the 4th wall to talk to the audience about those break-ups. He decides to go back and talk to these girls to see what went wrong and what does it all mean. Each segment sort of flies by before it even starts.I loved all the music chit chat, it seemed really natural and Tim Robbins cameo is absolutely hilarious. Both his sex and fight scenes steal the show. The film does tend to drag in places and cut be cut down 10 minutes or so, but it is definitely something you can watch more then once. I have a friend who says that this film speaks to him so much because he can see himself in the character. Another friend of mine says the same thing about Almost Famous.

53,philip_vanderveken,Not too sweet and very recognizable.,8,17 August 2005,"This movie has been on my list of movies that I want to see for quite some time. I knew that it got a very nice rating on this website and I was quite curious about it. But it wouldn't be the first disappointment because I was expecting too much of it and that's why I never came to watching it. Until now. Don't ask me why, because there was no special reason for it. I didn't just break up with my girlfriend, so it wasn't a choice of movie that seemed to be right for the moment.Rob is in his thirties and is the owner of a record-store that is situated in one of the worst neighborhoods to start a business in because there is almost no-one passing by. He doesn't have too much clients and his two clerks aren't exactly a great help either. But he doesn't really care, because he has other, bigger problems on his mind. He isn't a teenager anymore, although he sometimes still acts like one and he finally realizes that it's about time that he starts to grow up. His girlfriend has left him and in order to deal with the pain he starts to make a list of the five worst break-ups in his life. And while doing so, he recalls each break-up, tries to reconnect with his former girlfriends in order to find out why they dumped him...If the ladies are looking for an insight in the mind of the average man in his late twenties, early thirties, this might be a good movie to watch. And for us men it's nice to see that you aren't the only one who still seems to think like a teenager from time to time, even though you're already past that age for at least more than a decade. It's all recognizable and that's what makes this movie so funny. We all went (some of us probably still are) through such a 'crisis' and it's always nice to see a comedy that makes fun of it. And it has to be said, even though this could be categorized as a romantic comedy, this is by far one of the best in the genre, because there is absolutely nothing syrupy about it. I've seen several romantic comedies lately and seeing one as good as this one is a rarity, believe me.That it is so good also has a lot to do with the acting of course. John Cusack, Todd Louiso and Jack Black, who were really perfectly cast for their roles, really did a very fine job. Their three characters together made it perfect. If one of them would have been left out, this could never have been the same fine comedy. But they weren't the only good ones in this movie. A nice 'surprise' was Iben Hjejle. I had seen her once in ""Mifune's Last Song"", but I didn't know that she had played English speaking roles as well. She really did well and I hope to see her in similar roles soon.All in all this is one of the best examples when it comes to romantic comedies. This may well be one of the few that will appeal to women as well as to men, because it all is so recognizable and not sweet at all. I certainly liked it and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",High Fidelity
54,bandw,Three geeks and some pretty women,6,18 May 2008,"Befitting its title, music plays a big part in this movie, both on the soundtrack and in the story which has three thirty-something, vinyl-obsessed geeks running a music store in Chicago. Rob (John Cusack) is the owner of the store and he is assisted by Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black). Barry is loud, opinionated, and arrogant - if you don't agree with him, then you are beneath contempt. Barry would rather insult a customer who asks for an unapproved record than make a sale. Dick is sensitive, shy, scholarly, and his appreciation for pop-music is sincere. Louiso and Black create vividly articulated, delightful characters.The central plot line has Rob questioning why he has had such bad luck with women and he details his five most significant break-ups. He winds up talking to the camera much of the time. Some may find this intimate and appealing, but it didn't work for me - I would rather have had his neuroses worked out on screen than recited to us. Somewhat early on Rob asks himself the question, ""How does an average guy like me become the number one lover-man in his particular postal district? He's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the musical moron twins."" This question is the one I kept asking about Rob throughout the film and not being able to answer it is the reason I had a hard time swallowing the story. The break-ups Rob describes are with some very attractive women, the most recent being with Laura (the very fetching Iben Hjejle). I completely understood why Laura (a successful lawyer) would move on from Rob and I could not see what she saw in him that made her come back. The music and supporting cast are outstanding and they supply most of the appeal. There are lots of good lines. Consider Barry's reference to the name of his rock group, ""We're no longer called Sonic Death Monkey. We're on the verge of becoming Kathleen Turner Overdrive, but just for tonight, we are Barry Jive and his Uptown Five."" And what a kick it was for me to see that Black can actually sing. But the movie needs to be carried by Cusack and whenever he was on screen I tended to lose interest. At a macro level this is a cautionary tale about trying to turn one's passions into a business. You are most frequently going to be disappointed by the tastes of your customers and will wind up playing to a small audience and having a hell of a time making a go of it.",High Fidelity
55,Howlin Wolf,Bittersweet analysis of relationships strikes a chord.,10,10 October 2001,"Sorry about the lame musical pun in the summary (I swear it wasn't intended... !) but I truly found whilst watching High Fidelity that I connected strongly with the main character of Rob Gordon.  People here have said that they were turned off the movie because Rob is shallow, selfish, melancholic and anal (A bit worrying, since I said I identified with him!) but in my opinion, it's one of the first movies to show men & women as they actually ARE; not some glossy idealised version of how we want them to be. Yes, Rob is all those things, but then so are men (humans, really) in general, and so am I on occasion!   (SPOILERS)   Not only do I identify with the main character, I recognise virtually all of the supporting characters as variants of someone I've met.  There isn't a false note sounded in this film (that one WAS intended!)  Particularly good is the scene where Laura asks Rob for sex after her father's funeral. It shows perfectly that sometimes we do things when they are not appropriate, and we can't explain them, but sometimes we just want them.   The team have done a brilliant job of adapting the novel by Nick Hornby. The film never seems too static that you get bored, but you always have the sense that it was drawn from a literary source.  Changing the setting from London to Chicago alters nothing.  People are people wherever on the earth you find them, geography doesn't matter.  If it's a good enough argument for Nick Hornby, it's good enough for me!   Cusack is superb as always in the role of the 'protagonist'.  Newcomer (at least to American cinema) Hjejle acquits herself well as the iconclastic Laura and Black & Louiso are also good as Rob's friends/colleagues.  There are also many cameo's; of which Tim Robbins' in particular is hilarious!  As with ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", another Cusack labour of love, everything here seems put together perfectly.  The cast work well, the direction is top-notch, and the soundtrack is low-key but fantastic.  I urge anybody who has not yet seen this little gem of a film to check it out!  Feel free to e-mail or PM me if you watched based partly on my advice and were disappointed.  Everything about this film resonates for me, from the dialogue to the pathos of it all.  I have no idea what that says about me, but it's high praise indeed for the film! One for the jilted generation.",High Fidelity
56,oneguyrambling,"I am mostly Rob, part Barry. High Fidelity is all good.",9,25 April 2011,"Rob runs a record store, as in vinyl not CDs. He has two staff, one a mopey withdrawn emo-type named Dick who would like it if you agreed with him but y'know, no pressure. The other a brusque and loud 100% music snob Barry (Jack Black) who knows better than everyone else, including customers. Especially customers.Rob is in between, he loves his music but seems to respect everyone else's right to like what they like even if he doesn't agree. He seems a low key music snob. Rob's business remains afloat only through the continued business of similar music snobs of varied levels who go out of their way to shop there.The trio often share mixtapes and make impromptu music related lists with such titles as ""Best Side 1, Track 1s"" or I would guess ""Best revenge songs"".This is not what the film is about. This is merely a description of Rob and his two staff and the goings on in his record shop called Championship Vinyl.This is actually the part of the film I like best because it is the bit I identify with most.In my 20s I was the loud and obnoxious music (and movie) snob. I knew better than you (still do) and was more than happy to prove it. Mixtapes were my specialty, and if we were going for a drive of more than 15 minutes I would make sure that I had a tape or CD of my own, as I could not stomach listening to the radio or someone else's crappy music that was invariably nowhere near as good as mine.Now in my 30s I am probably more like Rob. I still think I know better, can still prove it on demand (my last ""mixtape"" – now Mix-CD was done a couple months ago), but I am happy to let others like what they like, admittedly behind a visage of well concealed disgust. I don't think I have it in me to be the withdrawn ""each to their own"" guy.And don't think that the correlation between me and the guys in this movie hasn't been pointed out before, many, many times.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ That's only the backdrop though. High Fidelity is actually about Rob (who I need to mention somewhere is played by John Cusack so there you go), and his relationship with Laura.Near the start of the film Laura dumps Rob unceremoniously, and due to the long term and intertwined nature of their relationship they remain in reasonable proximity.Close enough to give each other the shits and allows themselves to get wound up over nothing. Laura moves on, Rob stays and mopes, using music as his coping mechanism. He starts by reorganising his vast personal collection in different orders (personal CHECK!), not alphabetically or oldest to newest, but in order of purchase. He then lists the best breakup songs followed by his own personal Top 5 breakups from his past.Rob ultimately decides he must revisit these Top 5 breakup women personally to gain some form of closure. What results is a Schneider-lite version of the various wacky things that must ensue in film when you have a montage of different people, only without the obscure and pointless disorders that Schneider films (and Seinfeld episodes) demanded.Some meetings go well, others not so much.Later on Rob breaks the ice and hooks up with a local 27kg singer-songwriter played by Lisa Bonet, while Laura has moved in with her new man who not so conveniently lives in the floor above Rob's apartment. The best part being that the new lothario is played by an over-the-top Tim Robbins at his greasiest and most faux-sincere.Things get complicated as they must when Laura's situation changes once more only in more dramatic circumstances than a mere break up.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ High Fidelity justifies its existence through the inclusion of much guy banter with a keen eye on the role music plays as (guys) mature and move through life.If you are a guy and have no idea what that sentence above means, then this is merely a rom-com for you. Stay away.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ John Cusack is John Cusack, reliable, sensible and convincing. Like an old warm jumper you know what you're gonna get, and you like it.Jack Black steals the show in a role that he played before he morphed into ""Funnyman Jack Black"". (If I ever had the good fortune to run my own music shop I would go broke in 10 minutes as I would refuse to sell mainstream crap and would forever be pushing obscure CDs that no-one else would want to listen to but me. That is why JB's Barry is an employee, he would similarly fail if running the show.) Tim Robbins is hilarious in his bit part and Iben Hjelje is convincing in the confused and undecided Laura, especially when things turn and she momentarily loses her way.And Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas is actually vaguely likable and dare I say it attractive for a nanosecond despite being one of the more loathsome creatures on the planet.High Fidelity is a movie for music-snobs or people that at least partially identify with the obsessive nature of collectors or ""fan-dom"". I think if you are a go with the flow sort of person not much of this will ring true and you'll be left with a run of the mill rom-com.I like High Fidelity, but I no longer identify with it quite as much as I did 10 years ago.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. A solid film that will mean more to those that lived the life of Rob, Barry or even Dick.",High Fidelity
57,Sirus_the_Virus,Great movie.,10,24 October 2009,"High Fidelity isn't my favorite John Cusack movie. Mine is Being John Malkovich because of it's unique,odd and hilariousness. I know hilariousness isn't a word, but it should be in my opinion. As a romantic comedy, High Fidelity is unique.Have you ever heard that kind of thing before? A unique romantic comedy. Eternal sunshine was a unique romance, but it wasn't a romantic comedy. How could I compare Eternal sunshine to High Fidelity? There is no comparison. Eternal sunshine is better. But I am not saying that High fidelity is bad, because that is far from the truth. It's fantastic. John Cusack does a great job as Rob. I am not going to go into the plot because I am not in the mood. There are many funny scenes in this movie. I like the ones where John Cusack jumps across the counter so then he can strangle Jack Black. I thought those scenes were very funny. High Fidelity is a romantic movie about real people. Though they are based on made up characters, they sure seem real to me or us. Thumbs way up.High Fidelity:****/****",High Fidelity
58,Vomitron_G,An unmatched romantic comedy in my book,9,3 February 2010,"I watched it for the third time and it's still one of my favorite comedies ever. Intelligent and witty. A romantic comedy about relationships in a city. A touch of sadness, some genuine laughs and a lot of struggles. Well, actually, a film about girls, music and vinyl records. And more.What I like most about ""High Fidelity"", is the way it stands out amongst other romantic comedies. Most of these are either aimed at teenagers or for adults. Those teen romance comedies often tend to follow a clichéd, formulaic path heading for a happy ending. Those about adult relationships, often add a bit of drama & violins at proper times, to which you can set a timer. Not too keen about that either.But the ways of ""High Fidelity"" are much more original and both younger (those entering their first relationship) & older audiences (those who've had a few) should be able to relate to certain aspects. It's also not telling that good old story of ""boy meets girl"", but when the film begins, we're already stepping into a relationship with a lot of issues. It's pretty unpredictable, has a unique & clever way of telling the story (John Cusack often rambling on straight into the camera, flash-backs, flash-forwards), incorporates lots of cool stuff for music-lovers and above all, it's realistic, recognisable and pretty damn funny too. On a technical level (directing, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, etc), it's simply perfect. Films of this ilk, don't come much better than this.",High Fidelity
59,Spuzzlightyear,Boring!,3,19 May 2006,"After hearing everyone and his wife crow about how wonderful this movie was purported to be, I had really high expectations for this movie. This movie features John Cusack as a Record Store Owner who is having some relationship problems. We hear about them. HILARITY ENSUES! NOT! Honestly, I have never been more disappointed with a movie in a long time. Cusack looks half bored most of the times, his female co-stars are dull, and just everything runs on incohesion. Thank god I say for Jack Black and Todd Louiso, Cusack's employees in the record store. Any time that they were on screen, the movie became interesting and funny (Black especially), but when they went off, the movie collapses into a sinkhole again. Bah.",High Fidelity
60,napierslogs,The realistic and insightful comedy to the hopelessness of relationships,9,1 June 2011,"""High Fidelity"" is really not a romantic comedy. It's a comedy about the hopelessness of men and romance. Rob (John Cusack) is thirty-something and he owns a record store, but that's just because that's what happens after you break-up with a girl in college and you go into a stupor for days, weeks, months, years and when you wake up you have aged but not matured. The fact that Rob and his fellow record store employees are not mature is an understatement. And that's where the comedy comes in.The narration of Rob's thoughts and the analysis of his ""top 5 break-ups of all time"" are hilarious. The overall consensus that men are stupid and women are from another planet is taken to extremes, but realistic extremes. I, too, was shocked that his ex-girlfriend Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was in the phone book! Girls like Charlie shouldn't exist, but I'm not surprised that people like Nick Horny and his alter-ego Rob find them.Author Nick Hornby has an incredible talent for characterization; turning every day life into absurdities but back into realities and then making light of it all. Cusack fully embodies the immaturity and frustrations of slacker Rob, while Jack Black pours all of his manic energy into music exhibitionist Barry.Set in a record store with music lists like ""top 5 albums to play on a Monday morning"", music is certainly a major part of ""High Fidelity""—but not overwhelmingly so. It's funny and meaningful for snobs and neophytes alike, but preferably somewhere in between so you can appreciate their jabs at the smarter-than-thou indie-hipster scene.Breaking-up may be hard to do, but ""High Fidelity"" does it with a pumping soundtrack, insightful humour, and immensely quotable and hilarious dialogue.",High Fidelity
61,baumer,One the most intelligent and funny looks at dating against a backdrop of music,9,24 May 2000,"Warning: does contain spoilersWomen, do you ever wonder why a man just can't seem to settle down?  Do you ever cringe and shudder when you realize how vacilating men seem to be, and not just a few of them but all of them?  Here you are, this beautiful, intelligent career orientated women and you are full of verve and love.  And you think you've found the right guy and things are great.  But then suddenly, apathy comes knocking on your door and now it seems that you have lost your man.  Ever experience that or know how that feels?  Well, so does this film.Has anyone out there ever known someone that seems to be obsessesd with either the world of music or the world of film.  I mean the kind of guy where he can tell you not only the name of a song from 1979 but who it was made for or what the flip side of that single was?  Or a guy that can list his record collection in chronological order that they were bought?  Well this film does know guys like this because they exist here, in this small record store in Chicago.High Fidelity is one of the most original films to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.  It combines the backdrop of music and the foreground of dating and both worlds are hilariously dissected and an honest attempt is given to help us all understand the cataclysmic world of one and the obsessive world of the other, you figure out which world is destined for which.John Cusack plays Rob.  Rob is a small record store owner that specializes in hard to find records, or better yet, records that the fascist staff think is worthy for people to buy.  The other two guys that work there are pathetic in their own way.  Dick and Barry are complete opposites but one thing that is clear is their love for music.  Dick is a shy and submissive man that has many opinions but doesn't give them out as noxiously as Barry. Barry on the other hand, thinks mainstream music is the plague and only music he deams worthy is even permitted to cogitate about in the store.  Any modicum, any scent of an artist like Stevie Wonder or Bryan Adams is frowned upon, God only knows what he would be like if Britney Spears was mentioned. These two characters provide much of the comedy in the but it is such an intelligent and original way to do it.  It is refreshing to see comedy try something new every once in a while.  I am not opposed to films like Road Trip and American Pie ( I actually like them very much ) but once in a while it is cleansing to see Hollywood come out with something original.The crux of the film is about Rob's inability to stay with one woman.  He can always find something wrong with them and this in turn causes him to break up with them or they seem to find him banal and they leave him.  From these experience, Rob starts his top five list.  This list consists of top five things about everything.  Top five records about.. top five songs about... and top five breakups.  Laura is his latest break-up and he does not want to give her the pleasure of admitting her to the top five so he goes on telling himself how worthless she really was.  But as the film goes on he can't get her out of his head and wants her back badly.  Now this is where most films take the course that is subscribed to as Romance 101.  This is where scriptwriters set up the love interest, take it away, and then the rest of the film kinetically involves the one party proving to the other party that he is worthy of her.  End of story, they live happily ever after. But High Fidelity is different.  Laura is different.  Laura knows what Rob is like, she has spent the last two years of her life with him and she is not going to come back that easily.  And it is here that Rob goes on one of the most honest and complete journeys that I have seen a character go through.  Sure he learns about himself and wants to change that, but it is what he learns about himself that is the fascinating part. 
"" Then I began to realize that they only have one pair of frilly red underwear.  The rest is just regular cotton.""Rob begins to learn that the idea of the perfect relationship is just a fantasy, and in fantasies, nothing ever goes wrong.  But eventually those fantasies turn into six month relationships and work is actually involved and spontaneous sex on the floor turns into sex on the weekend, on a bed, between the hours of midnight and one in the morning.  It's not to say that relationships get stagnant and boring, but they are not sex on a first date either.High Fidelity is honest, smart and incredibly original and funny in so many ways.  But it is the honesty that I enjoyed about the film the most, well, that and Barry.  After all, a film that can tell you why men are as mobile as they are and then can end it with a man that apparently has no talent singing his guts out and sounding like Barry White, well it is a treat. Films don't come out like this often and that is because they are smart. Smart is not easy to do in Hollywood.9 out of 10 ( also look for a hilarious cameo by Tim Robbins )",High Fidelity
62,kevin c,not in MY TOP 5,5,24 July 2000,"Very much a romantic comedy aimed at men. In many ways it's a cliche-ridden tale, and you've seen all the funny lines in the trailer (why do they do that?) The fact that Cusack is one of the best mainstream actors around does help matters. He holds you attention, and frankly he has to acting opposite the wooden Hjejle. The joy of the film is recognising some of your own obsessive traits. Don't all people keep their C.D's in an A-Z order then?",High Fidelity
63,sharky_55,Is this the new Green Day?,8,23 July 2016,"Rob Gordon is stuck in middle-age purgatory, constantly flitting from relationship to relationship when asked to take an step forward and grow. Like Woody Allen's characters in his great romantic comedies, who couldn't help from making a joke of all but the gravest of situations, he segments and designates his life by his love of music. He and his two friends share this talent of musical elitism and snobbery; they spend all day berating the poor taste of their customers, they immediately try to define any real life scenario with the best song to fit, and then every now and again they even sell a record. But Stephen Frears isn't just playing the bad guy; Rob's passion for music, however snobbish, is authentic, and Frears finds a way to elicit not only humour out of it, but eventually good. They want to broaden the tastes of the wider public, and Cusack is so confident in his love for The Beta Band and their ability to turn heads and ears. When two youthful thieves run off with a bunch of records, they furiously give chase, before the confrontation turns into a hilarious argument about the poor taste of their stolen records. Frears plays this straight, making it funnier, but also seeding the roots of Rob's passion and eventual discovery of the pair's talent. Naturally, he wants to help foster and let others hear it too. Cusack is the perfect choice. He is a product of his early career, the teen movies, and he brings this experience and baggage into his portrayal of Rob. Much of the exposition has him talking and facing the camera, narrating his own story, as if he was one of those directors or writers who make themselves the main and best character. So the frames close in on his story, the backgrounds vanish, and Cusack motions and pours out his life story for the audience. His voice-over is angry, volatile, unable to consider any perspective other than his own, and has self-depreciating quality that swiftly sheds himself of any blame. Perplexed, he beings a journey of diving back into his past to discover exactly the reason for his failed relationships. When he meets an ex who is similarly despondent, he recognises the same signs of ""sad, single person culture"", but has no empathy. He is too high and mighty for that. The best scenes of the film come from his back and forth with his most recent ex-girlfriend Laura, who has finally had enough and packed the bags. This is where Rob is at his most self-righteous, most unaware. The messy breakup process is very clearly painful for her to, but Rob is only concerned with himself, so he sabotages each encounter with her with crass, unimportant queries. He feels entitled to have a say in the negotiation of this period, so he assaults her with a barrage of requests and phone-calls, and because she is much nicer and more mature than him, she plays along. Rob seems to have picked out the score for the film himself; when it seems certain that they will not get back together, it croons with Velvet Underground. And in a moment which completely illustrates his lack of sensitivity and maturity, he jumps for joy to Queen's We Are the Champions, just because Laura has not yet consummated her next relationship. Very funny, and very sad indeed. But of course they do eventually, and Rob, whose short-sightedness prevented him from seeing so, descends back into the mopey, 'the whole world is against me routine'. He calls her in the night, soaking in the rain and holding back tears, blubbering and trying to win her back. This act is so perfectly reminiscent of Cusack's iconic moment in Say Anything, holding the stereo aloft all night. The connection works because Cusack is no longer a teenager, but still held ransom by these teenage swings of emotion, so heart-wrenching he can barely function. What prevents High Fidelity from being a great film is how it momentarily slips up into soppy, conventional romantic comedy territory. Much of the film is ruthless in its dissection of Rob's faults, but it all falls into place like a typical romance does when he and Laura get back together. Laura is barely a character here; she simply flops over for him, conveniently sweeping Ian aside to reward an undeserving Rob with sex. It so clearly feels like one of his 'cool' fantasies that I was begging for the scene to rewind. Instead the film acts like a broken record, skipping ahead of the implied complications to that sweet-toothed ending. It isn't a bad ending; there is nothing wrong with expecting Rob to pick up the pieces of his life and finally move forward in his relationship. But it does seem like a bit of a let off.",High Fidelity
64,jhclues,"""Okay, name the top five movies about music that--""",8,19 February 2001,"A man suddenly closer to middle age than to the carefree frivolous years of youth begins to understand the consequences of non-commitment in terms of his relationships with women, in `High Fidelity,' directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Cusack.  When his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), leaves him for the guy upstairs in their apartment building, Rob Gordon (Cusack) begins to take stock of his life by reflecting upon the `top five break-ups' he's suffered over the years, seeking answers to the seeming pattern of rejection that has plagued him since Junior High School.  As he does so, it establishes a thread that runs throughout the film through which some insight into Rob's (as well as some of the others) character is gleaned: `Top five' lists that reference music (Rob owns a specialty record store, specializing in `vinyl') based on category and sub-category, with his `break-ups' and finally `top five jobs,' framing the story. 	Set in Chicago, with Rob's store in a neighborhood not especially conducive to `walk-in' trade, Frears sets a mood and atmosphere that conveys the freedom of a rock n' roll lifestyle and evokes the yearnings of youth on the threshold of discovering reality.  Though Rob personifies an entire generation that has `been to the mountain,' only to be faced with coming back down again, Frears takes something of a lighthearted approach to Rob's angst, with a brisk pace and by infusing enough subtle humor (though somewhat dark at times) into the proceedings to keep it lively and entertaining.  There's a gritty, down-to-earth feel to the film, along with a sense of time and place with which anyone in the audience will be able to relate on a personal level, for this is the kind of territory, in one way or another, that most people have traversed; a vicarious route to self-discovery, if you will. 	John Cusack is perfectly cast as Rob, carrying his cloud of burden with wry, almost self-deprecating amusement.  His naturally outgoing persona is just right for illuminating Rob's introspective thoughts, which he shares with the viewer by speaking directly into the camera, and it works exceptionally well, for it conveys a sense of being privy to a most intimate confidence.  And Cusack lends something of a Nicolas Cage `hang-dog' look to Rob, which gives him a quirky, likable appeal.  Hjejle gives a notable performance as well, as the woman in Rob's life who at last precipitates his life altering musings. 	The supporting cast includes Jack Black, who turns in an exuberant, memorable performance as Barry, one of Rob's employees with aspirations of becoming a rock star; and Todd Louiso, as Dick, Rob's other employee, whose stark contrast in personality to Barry makes him equally as memorable. Rounding out the supporting players are Lisa Bonet (Marie DeSalle), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Charlie), Joan Cusack (Liz), Tim Robbins (Ian), Lili Taylor (Sarah) and Natasha Gregson Wagner (Caroline).  Cleverly written (screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis from the book by Nick Hornby) and well presented, `High Fidelity' succinctly captures a specific culture and a lifestyle of ambivalence invested with obsessions and eccentricities (Rob, for example, sorts his personal record collection `autobiographically'). It's an entertaining, funny and sometimes insightful look at life as we know it; a good story with plenty of music, some laughs, and engaging performances, which make this film more than worth seeing, especially for fans of John Cusack, and for anyone who wants some insight into the influence popular music has indeed made upon the world in which we live.  I rate this one 8/10.",High Fidelity

It stars Nick Cusack as a record store owner who is having a mini mid life crisis when it comes to his relationships. This is a very intelligent movie and funny throughout which i dont say too often about American comedy's but the Yanks cant claim this one for themselves. Although the acting from everyone is superb the real hero of this movie is Nick Hornby the writer. He has written a book that is so engrossing that you cant fail to be mesmerised by the film. If you are new to Nick hornbys work watch the film FEVER PITCH or read the book of the same name , it is of the same mould as Fever Pitch. The best way i can describe Fever pitch and High Fidelty is that they are love stories for both women and men , maybe they are even more suited to men and how many love story's can you say that about?

By constantly speaking to the viewers, he seems determined to bring back his historic failures or even make contact to the persons involved just to realize what went wrong. The way the main character performs and interacts with the audience has to be the best part of the movie. As the story unfolds, the dramatic but also funny life stories begin to influence his life, seeming to affect even his part at the store, but his two unique colleagues and friends will always be there for him.I have to say that the plot is very enjoyable, together with its excellent characters, very well described and played, complex and full of surprises, which manages to transmit plenty of emotion, drama but also laughter. Boredom is out of the question, although the action seems to be on the lower side, having plenty of substance to keep you attracted to what's going on. The finale is very satisfying, making the whole story worthwhile.To sum things up, it's a very good movie, full of great characters and actors which, through a great plot and way of communication, manages to provide a quality time for its viewers.

68,TheNorthernMonkee,"Music, Comedy, Jack Black, John Cusack. All good",9,9 July 2004,"SPOILERSOne of the few writers who has been able to describe the male emotion of the last ten years is the legendary Nick Hornby. In his book ""Fever Pitch"", Hornby discussed his years as an Arsenal supporter and what football meant to him. In ""High Fidelity"" Hornby switched his attention to music and ex-girlfriends.In the film version of ""High Fidelity"", we are introduced to Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Rob, owner of a record shop and an obsessive music fan, has just been dumped by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) and is in a fit of depression. Spending time at the shop with his staff Dick and Barry (Todd Louiso and the glorious Jack Black), Rob attempts to win his girlfriend back and do something with his life, whilst simultaneously being able to listen to the music which he loves.""High Fidelity"" is a truly brilliant film. It's one of those films which people know and love. It's not an award winner, although Jack Black is superb as eccentric Barry, but that doesn't matter as this adaptation of Hornby's film is stunning.John Cusack as Rob is excellent. A master of the art, Cusack is an actor which nobody hates. With a sense of normality, Cusack seems to make every character he plays likable and believable. Whilst he has recently attempted to expand his range (Max Rothman in ""Max"" for example), Cusack is generally stereotypical as this anti-hero slob who we all love and adore.The thing which makes ""High Fidelity"" so wonderful is that it is ultimately an excellent adaptation of a beautiful book. Whilst DeVincentis' screenplay has relocated the story from London to Chicago, this relocation has been tolerable due to the simple fact that there are no aspects of the book requiring reference to location or historical buildings. If the original story had featured a scene where Rob had taken Laura to the Tower Of London whilst he explained how he felt, difficulties might have occurred. Ultimately though, this never happened and we can breath a sigh of relief.Finally, perhaps one of the best aspects of ""High Fidelity"" is it's soundtrack. With a soundtrack ranging from Stiff Little Fingers to Stevie Wonder, ""High Fidelity"" has what is a beautiful collection of music. The personal favourite being when Rob claims he will sell so many copies of the Beta Band's album simply by playing part of their song ""Dry The Rain"". By knowing a wide variety of music, this film shows how close to it's subject matter it truly is.All in all, ""High Fidelity"" is a joy to watch. Combining the feelings of the typical music lover and romantic alike, this film cannot be questioned. As Rob, John Cusack is spot on and does himself a great credit. The same can be true of Jack Black as Barry. All in all, to add a personal tone to this review, ""High Fidelity"" is one of my all time favourite films. To use the film's notion of Top 10s, ""High Fidelity"" is often suggested as being my all time number one film. If you haven't seen ""High Fidelity"", you don't know what your missing!

69,gelman@attglobal.net,Too Talky and Too Long,6,2 January 2006,"""High Fidelity"" has its moments: But it meanders all over the place, has Cusack on screen talking to the audience far too often -- and it's self-indulgent. But the Danish actress, Iben Hjejle, is excellent as Cusack's girl friend and I'm sorry she hasn't chosen (or hasn't been asked) to make additional movies in America because she more than holds her own both as an actress and as a beauty. The best thing about this movie, however, is Jack Black as a clerk in Cusack's record store who won't sell to customers whose musical tastes he considers inferior (which seems to be everybody who enters the store) and Todd Luiso as another and even weirder member of Cusack's sales staff. There are cameo appearances by Catherine Zeta-Jones as one of Cusack's former girl friends, Tom Robbins as Cusack's temporary successor as Hjejle's boy friend, Lisa Bonet as a singer whose bed Cusack occupies while he's separated from Hjejle and Bruce Springsteen as himself.

Equal thanks that it also has Jack Black as the smartass record store employee (paid for three days - turns up for six, therefore unsackable!) who doesn't have a life outside of  vinyl - or so it seems.This is a bit of different love story film because it surprises you. Girls are not just sitting by the phone waiting for the boy to call, indeed they have careers, interests and agendas. They might even be ahead in life.This is not a physical comedy, more a sound comedy - the mental torture of listening to Katrina and the Waves (Walking On Sunshine) at ultra high volume was the best joke of the whole movie. Closely followed by a cameo from a well known superstar.The great thing is that nothing really happens. No one is going to change much. This isn't a journey movie or if it is it is on a circular track. Cusack is merely learning that a cake once eaten disappears and that the things that matter in life and attract you to people are often trivial.Credit must go to book author Hornby who is one of life's great introspectionists, he says out loud (or rather in print) what we really think and feel and when we hear it our laugh is the laugh of recognition. This work is not as good as his first novel ""Fever Pitch"" (about football), but works better as a film.High Fidelity is a small movie about big things. There is more to it than meets the eye, you think about it later and spot the central characters in real life. The central moral is that records and hobbies are great and let us all enjoy them for what they are, but they are not something we can put our arms around on a cold night or share feelings and emotions with.",High Fidelity

Has anyone ever given Robbins the credit he deserves for not only being such a talented actor (comedy and serious roles alike), but also an important director (""Dead Man Walking"", ""Cradle Will Rock"")? Anyway, John Cusack (starring for the fifth time in a movie alongside Tim Robbins, I believe) is great once again as the abandoned lover. And although I had problems with her at the beginning I have even gotten to like how Joelle Carter portrays Laura. (I still wish I could recast the movie with Winona Ryder playing this role, though).

74,the red duchess,Frears' best film in a while. (possible spoilers),6,24 July 2000,"'High Fidelity' is about fidelity, and not just of the relationship sort. It is about music, about how we use it to express emotions we cannot - the insights of the songs have a high fidelity to the way we feel.  But somehow the medium has obscured the message, and Rob has become more obsessed by the emotions in songs than the real-life emotions they are supposed to reflect. The former without the latter becomes a sterile, self-glorifying thing - music provides the ready-made emotions so we don't have to go through the experiences needed to feel them.  It's a bit like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' - when Barry sings a horribly slick, muzak 'Let's Get it On' at the climax, the authenticity of the Marvin Gaye original has been seeped out to a series of amusing postures - we have sucked out others' emotions so that they become pods, and we cover versions.Or, 'Fidelity' is about maturity.  Specifically male maturity.  About the inability of boys to give up the signs of adolescent independence.  Laura says Rob never changes, develops, progresses as a person.  The collecting and classifying of things is a conservative act, a way of building up so much baggage you can't move.  This is not necessarily unadmirable.  The real world isn't very nice.  The world of music and lists is a nurturing womb far more reassuring than real mother 'love'; it doesn't tell you you're a failure.  Liking independent records is a mark of independence; running an independent store, and not some megastore, is a refusal to play the corporate game.  Rob can only sustain this fantasy, of course, by scabbing off his girlfriend.  Independence is a myth.So it is with independence in movies.  'Fidelity' might like to see itself as an opposition to generic Hollywood fare - its dish of intelligence, verbosity, character and sense of locale an alternative to the fast food of blockbusters, dumb thrills, idiotic dialogue, stereotypes and flashy visuals.  And 'Fidelity' does kind of ramble instead of offering a conventional three-act-structure.  It mocks (rather misogynistically?) starlets for their powerful vacuity.  It disrupts its boy-girl conflict/resolution with a very adult and unusual doubt and lack of closure. The final ambiguous scene suggest that Rob has finally matured, but also suggests that he is trying to subsume maturity into his unchanging way of life, a project which can only fail.The brilliant thing about this film is that it all takes place in Rob's head.  Although he doesn't actually seem to like music all that much, the music in the soundtrack, rather archly, comments on his state of mind. Characters and events subtly change or are reinterpreted the more insights he develops.  The mixture of to-camera narration and drama has been done before, but usually the boundaries are drawn - here the mixture of commentary and action within the one narrative means that one always undermines the other, and we we can clearly see the holes in Rob's solipsistic house of cards.  It is easy to forget, such is his verbal facility and winning charm, how many truly ghastly characters John Cusack plays (in this duality he is very much like James Woods), and Rob here is a monster, a raving egotist, who appropriates everything to his own self-image, including the weather (all that pneumonia-free rain).This is a hugely enjoyable film, full of great insights, comic set-pieces and moments of recognition that made me squirm.  Stephen Frears more usually deals with combinations of people than with one overpowering individual and Rob's monomania soon becomes wearing; the best scenes are those featuring Jack Black, as everyone's been saying.  Frears always excels at a sense of place, especially interiors, a place where people actually live and are defined, and this film is no exception, the bureaucratic stacks of plastic ultimately exposing and overpowering Rob's emotional emptiness.But 'Fidelity' is, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, as irritating as it is entertaining.  I love John Cusack, and he is superb, unafraid to be dislikeable; but too many of his films are the same, so that there is a mini-genre, the John Cusack film.  I just wish he's try to be a little more adventurous.",High Fidelity
75,FlickJunkie-2,Worth seeing,7,4 October 2000,"High Fidelity is an angst ridden narrative comedy about Rob's (John Cusack) bad luck with women.  His girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has just dumped him.  This sends him into a hurricane of self-doubt and introspection about all the most traumatic breakups in his life complete with flashbacks of each of the top five.  While vainly trying to get Laura back, he contacts all the other breakup perpetrators in an attempt to exorcise the ghosts of relationships past.The film has plenty of funny moments and a high identification factor for single adults suffering through the dating scene.  Director Stephen Frears gives it a Woody Allenesque presentation and does it as well as if had been done by Allen himself.  Though there is not much that is original about the story, it borrows good techniques and ideas from various romantic comedy formats, and melds them together effectively.The biggest problem for me was the main character, Rob.  This was more the way he was written than the way Cusack played him, because I thought the acting was excellent.  Rob was seriously out of touch with his hand in his own demise, which made him seem like a jerk.  His rationalizations for relieving his guilt and sense of failure for past relationships made him a very superficial and hollow character, regardless of the sincerity of his self inflicted torment.  This inability for me to identify with the lead detracted somewhat from a story that was otherwise well done.John Cusack was terrific.  He was fabulous at licking his litany of self-inflicted wounds, and though I didn't fall in love with the character, his portrayal of this anguished lovelorn puppy was first rate.  Iben Hjejle was also very good as Laura, giving her a sort of dignified confusion as she tried to sort things out.This film was good and definitely worth seeing, but it didn't send me over the edge.  As is often true, the hype was overblown.  I rated it a 7/10. Add a point or two if you are single and you just broke up with someone.",High Fidelity

As a white heterosexual male in his 30s, whose biggest passion in life is music, who obsessively writes lists, still makes mix CDs and longs for nostalgia, I should have loved this. I hated it.The main character is downright scary, cringeworthy and an awful example of toxic masculinity. Self-centered, pretentious. I could go on. The character arc kind of petered out into nothingness. For all the self-indulgent insights, nothing was really gained.Jack Black steals each scene he is in, and it's easy to see why it was his breakout role.

This book takes place in London, but the universal appeal of music makes it's transfer to Chicago seamlessly natural (we...(read more) are all united by pop songs). The characters are deeply flawed, honest, and funny. This is one of best examples of voice over narrative and breaking the fourth wall for direct audience addresses working perfectly, without drawing too much attention to itself. It's excellent, got a great soundtrack, some jokes that are likely to go over a few non music-heads heads, but for the most apart it's a film almost anyone can relate to in some aspect, be it relationships, music, or obsessive listing. But enough has been written and said about this movie, just see it. Good times",High Fidelity
80,SKG-2,Cusack continues winning streak with this film,8,5 April 2000,"I read the novel when it first came out because the title intrigued me, and I found it quite good.  When I heard John Cusack was adapting it and moving the action to Chicago(from London in the novel), I was a little worried, because I worry about changing things during adaptations for arbitrary reasons, but I needn't have worried; though I have a few quibbles, which we'll get to later, Cusack and Co. have done a fine job adapting the novel.First off, I've read one comment which claims it stereotypes ""music geeks."" The type of people Hornby, Cusack, his co-writers(D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink, who also co-wrote GROSSE POINT BLANK, and Scott Rosenberg), and director Stephen Frears are portraying is a very particular type of ""music geek""; the type who is a snob about music.  Almost all of us, I would say, are aggressive about our likes and dislikes when it comes to music, but not many, I agree, compare liking Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel to ""agreeing with both the Israelis and the Palestinians.""  And probably not many of us would be so cut off from feelings that, when hearing about a person's death, would find no better way of expressing their sorrow than listing their top 5 songs about death.  Yet we do like these people as characters because we see even if they have some snotty attitudes, they do have a genuine love for their music, and they're in a low-paying job because they love what they do. And who among us hasn't turned to music when we've felt sad(or happy), like Rob does, or wished that Bruce Springsteen(and a pox on the person who, in their comments, implied he was passe.  Bruce will NEVER be passe) would talk to us directly like he talks to us through his music?  The novel and the movie captures all of that.Another strength, of course, is Cusack's performance.  Woody Allen once said that while American actors were very good at playing virile men of action, there weren't many who could play more ""normal,"" regular people.  Cusack, on the other hand, has carved out a niche for himself playing regular guys.  He doesn't look like The Boy Next Door, and he's neither stereotypically sensitive or hip, but comes across as a guy who feels both at ease and yet still longs for something more.  At his best, like in movies such as THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING, THE GRIFTERS, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, GROSSE POINT BLANK, and this, he plays people on the cusp of growing up, who are able to if they want to, but aren't sure if they want to, and yet he's made each of them different.  Rob's condition may be a little more conventional - he's not sure if he wants to settle down yet - but Cusack, while unafraid to show his unlikable qualities, makes us like Rob anyway.The rest of the cast is also quite good.  The well-known names only get short takes(Lisa Bonet, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones), but they make the most of their time.  I've never seen Iben Hjejle before(I haven't seen MIFUNE), but she does well as the most grown-up person in the movie.  But the real stars, besides Cusack and the music, are Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Rob's co-workers.  Black especially reminds me of people I knew.As I said, I do have some quibbles.  There are a couple of incidents in the book which don't make it to the film which I would have liked to see(the Sid James Experience, and the lady who wanted to sell Rob a ton of valuable records for a ridiculously low price).  I'm getting tired of movies which use rain as an expression of sorrow, and this is an example of overuse.  And the character of Laura isn't developed as well in the movie as she was in the novel.  Nevertheless, this is well worth checking out.",High Fidelity
81,AKS-6,Funny and interesting,6,17 February 2001,"I read Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity a few years ago and I loved it, so when I rented this film I couldn't help but wondering how on earth anyone could turn that novel into a film. It couldn't have been an easy task. The solution, as is seen in the movie, was to turn the novel into a narration where John Cusack is looking straight into the camera a lot of time. I believe this was a very brave step, and with any other actor than the brilliant Cusack playing Rob, it wouldn't have worked.They've also managed to get a great cast together: John Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack (no surprise to anyone who've watched a few John Cusack-films) and Lili Taylor. Brilliant cast. High Fidelity is also funny, sweet, and engaging. Recommended.",High Fidelity

83,chrisbrown6453,"High Fidelity offers a comedic look at its heartbroken main character and narrator, whose recent breakup forces him to rethink his previous failed romances and to confront the fear of commitment.",7,10 July 2001,"The owner of a vinyl record store Rob Gordon played by John Cusack (Being John Malkovich) feels misled and mistreated by his new ex-girlfriend Laura played by Iben Hjejle (Mifune). Bored and confused, Rob decides to revisit a series of old girlfriends (played by Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter and Catherine Zeta-Jones) in order to learn from their reasons for having rejected him. When his research produces a somewhat optimistic view of himself, Rob's self-esteem is revitalized and he feels compelled to pursue a new adventure with the exotic Marie DeSalle (Lisa Bonet). Conflicts arise when Rob learns about Laura's sudden interest in his intolerable neighbor Ian (Tim Robbins).High Fidelity portrays the banal aspects of falling in and out of love. Its main character, who personifies the identifiable ups and downs of bachelorhood, often turns to the camera to describe his misfortunes and to incite the viewers' sense of sympathy and humor. High Fidelity draws most of its comedy, however, from Rob's two eccentric employees, Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Todd Louiso), whose well-defined personalities and distinct tastes in music contrast Rob's overall ambivalence. High Fidelity offers a strictly male point of view by depicting a world where every male character --troubled or not-- is nonetheless a funny character, and where all female characters are either too angered, too hurt or too indifferent, yet always serious. This choice supports the protagonist's perception of the female mind as impenetrable and makes High Fidelity a film which comments one-sidedly on the irrationality of love.",High Fidelity

It deals with a whining John Cusack complaining about all of his past relationships with girls and how they didnt work, who really cares, for those of us who cant even find relationships this movie is terrible.  This movie made me dislike John Cusack, who I liked in Grosse Pointe Blank, and Being John Malkavich. I guess the problem is that I cant really relate to his problems, and if you cant there is really nothing for you in this movie.

85,moviemanMA,The Perfect Comedy,10,22 August 2005,"Music and movies are like white on rice. It's the perfect blend of sight and sound that can make or break a film. Even when sound wasn't available for pictures, music was still played when people saw them. Movies about music have been produced and music about movies have been recorded. Sometimes, one of these films just stands out...High Fidelity is a comedy about Rob Gordan (John Cusack), a record store owner/operator who has recently split with his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) and now is trying to get it all together. The movie opens with her leaving and Rob giving us his top five list of the most painful breakups. At work, his two ""employees"" Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black) share his passion for music and to tell people that what to listen to. The top five motif is present throughout the entire movie, giving it a unique take on life. Rob cheated on Laura, borrowed money from Laura and hasn't given it back to her, and caused Laura to have an abortion. He pretty much feels like a jerk, but it all goes away when he finds out that she is living with Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins), his former neighbor known as ""Ray"".When Rob realizes that he is miserable from thinking about his breakups from past years, he has an epiphany. If he just confronts each one individually, the pain will go away. To just see that they have moved on so he can move on as well, but the anguish over Laura resonates due to the fact that she keeps coming over to get her stuff. Now Rob must figure out if he should just move or try to make amends with Laura and get back together.Stephen Frears directs and his style is perfect for the story. Going from flashback to reality to dreamworld and back to reality effortlessly is quite an accomplishment. He takes Nick Hornby's book and makes it into something amazing. Cusack is fantastic as the funny, sometimes self loathing music enthusiast. He narrates just about the entire movie and some of the dialogue he gives us is priceless. Black and Louiso seem to be on opposite ends of the rock and roll spectrum but they come together to appreciate the art of making music even with their sometimes totally different styles. Black is very energetic as the self-proclaimed 'know it all' of rock music and Louiso is the calm, quiet rocker. Even Hjejle and Cusack's sister Joan give great performances. All together the cast did incredibly well.High Fidelity is one of the funniest and most creative comedies to hit the big screen. It is a perfect movie to just pop in one night and enjoy. It's a great date movie, buddy movie, or anytime movie. This movie will have you making 'top five' list's in no time...",High Fidelity
86,AvidClimber,High Fidelity — A movie about a breakup with humor and lots of intelligent inner monologues,10,8 December 2012,"High Fidelity is another of my all time favorite. John Cusack excels at brooding philosophical monologues loaded with sarcastic humor, and this movie really makes him shine.He plays a sort of half-decent asshole which he admits being. However, the jokes and the situation makes it hard to see and kind of love him, which in turn enables you to really appreciate the whole story.The characters are well played, Jack Black is his exuberant early self, and even the other sales clerk provides us with a lovable quiet self-effaced persona (a great balance to Cusack and Black). John Cusack himself is great, if a tiny bit over the top (which makes the movie, I must say), and his sister, Joan, is particularly well casted.The dialogs are near perfect, the montage is without reproach (I especially like the one live mental alternate possibilities), and the soundtrack amazing.See it, especially if you like lots of smart text.",High Fidelity

It's easy to identify with this character, or I thought it was. Never having read the Hornby book I found the film very insightful, at times funny and, if you have your girlfriend sitting next to you, sometimes scary. A definite feel good movie, but we all need that, and this delivers but without being too corny or cheesey. A very good film that asks you questions that you've always asked yourself anyway, if you're a guy that is.

89,dead47548,Flawless.,10,27 October 2007,"It's very rare for me to start a film and within the first ten or fifteen minutes fall completely head over heels in love with it. High Fidelity transcends this rarity. Within mere seconds, my eyes were glued and my jaw was dropped by how incredibly in love with it I became. Everything from the wild performances to the wonderful moral to the flawless soundtrack was absolutely perfect. It's a film about maturing and realizing that nothing is the way you want it to be, so you need to learn how to settle. It also happens to be one of the most enjoyable films of all time.This modern tale of growing up takes place under the story of a breakup and one man's desperate need to discover why his partners always go right from him to someone else. Over the first thirty or so minutes, Rob Gordon (John Cusack) goes through his all-time, top-five most memorable breakups and we see that each one of them ended because the girl chose someone else over him (except for the one that he broke up with due to her lack of sexual promiscuity; immediately after their split she slept with a guy). The film begins with the newest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle) who we soon find out is now bedding Ian (Tim Robbins), more commonly referred to as Ray. This sends him into a reassessment of his own life and he decides to find these other four women and figure out why they chose someone else over him.In doing this, he discovers that these women weren't what he remembered them to be. They are extremely flawed individuals whom he wouldn't want to take back, even if they wanted him back. This sparks his realization that all of his fantasies of what his dream life should be and how perfect everything is in his mind is never really the truth. He slowly accepts that in the real world he has to settle constantly and nothing can be completely perfect. No matter what, every element of life has it's flaws and every relationship has bumps to get past. He had been putting all of these ex-girlfriends up on a pedestal and it took this revelation in order to bring them down. Due to this realization, he was finally able to move on with his life and actually mature instead of remaining in the constant void of unrequited fantasies he had trapped himself in.I'm not one for spoiling endings, but I have to say that High Fidelity features one of the most satisfying finales as far as I'm concerned. Rob's newfound maturity and ability to move on with his life, along with a wonderful decision from a certain someone, does nothing but bring an enormous smile to my face. A lot of this enjoyment comes from the satisfaction achieved by one of the most relatable characters in film history. Rob is easily a character that very closely resembles my own self in so many ways. It goes beyond his excellent taste in music and the fact that he builds up fantasies that are far more perfect than any thing could realistically become to the smallest elements of his life like his trivial tendency to make 'Top 5' lists on the most insignificant things. I can find so much in myself that is similar to Rob, so watching him succeed in life almost gives me a sense that I can eventually succeed as well.Something I've always said when it comes to film is that my favorite elements belong to the story and the characters. High Fidelity excels in both of these categories by an immense proportion. The story is inspirational and highly engaging with deep characters who entrance you and keep you glued to the screen. Rob's riffs to the audience are brilliant and range from being absolutely heart-shattering to side-splitting hilarity. Speaking of hilarity, comic relief has never tasted as sweet as the combination of Dick and Barry, the two employees at the record store Rob owns played impeccably by Todd Louiso and Jack Black respectively. The three of them bounce off one another seamlessly and give a pure sense of authenticity and keep the laughs coming in this wonderful tale. All of the performances are just as strong as the rest of the film, but the highlight is clearly from the anchor John Cusack. He's also been an actor I felt I could relate to and in becoming this character that relatability only increases massively. He hits such a range of emotion and becomes this character so flawlessly that it seems as if Stephen Frears just put a camera on him and told him to say whatever he wants.

There is a lot of honesty to this movie, all the characters seem like real people. It was interesting when Rob always broke things down into a top five list; this is a very predominant feature of Rob, there's always a top five to everything. Though this does focus a lot on Rob's life, its great when we break off occasionally and we look into his two employees; Dick and Barry. They are such interesting characters, and such polar opposites of each other.John Cusack is great as Rob, he really suited the role.

96,smakawhat,To true to life..,9,16 August 2000,"John Cusak is Rob Gordon, a record nut aficionado who owns a vintage record store in Chicago.  Rob's store is a carbon copy of every music/vinyl nuts salvation.  The movie is told through Rob's narration.  Many times he speaks directly into the camera right to the audience.  He is telling us his life is a dismal failure with relationships and that is what the movie is essentially about.. Rob's relationship screw-ups and that he is a failure.One thing Rob does is classify everything into top 5 lists.  He then proceeds to talk about his top 5 break ups of all time just as we are introduced to him and see his current fiancée leave him.  We are also introduced to other characters in his life particularly 2 people who work at his store.  Rob hired them to work in only 3 days a week but they drop by EVERY DAY to work and talk shop cause they have no life other than talking about music.  Rob can't get rid of them, particularly one guy who is so uppity with his taste in music, that he frequently insults customers tastes who come to the store with his elitist music attitude.  Thinking Rob is somewhat cursed he decides to revisit what happened to the other top 5 in his life to find answers, and perhaps but his soul at ease.This movie is a total riot.  You will TOTALLY recognize all these characters as someone you knew or currently know in your life, and that's one of the movies greatest successes.  The characters are so real as they talk about, love, loss, rejection, money, sex etc This movie also has some hilarious scenes, one in particular that is SO funny that I thought I was going to die in the theatre.  The audience was just HOWLING!!!  I can't tell you what it is you have to see the film.Also the flashbacks of Rob that are shown are great particularly when he is in college during the 80's.  They had the style of the decade down perfectly (even though it was a very small part in the film).  Also it is probably the best movie that deals about relationships that I have ever seen.  Every guy can relate to Rob and his experiences with other women.  I certainly know that for a fact being through what Rob went through as well.  Also a good friend of mine had the exact same thing happen to him with someone he was living with.This is one of the few movies that I have seen that shows what relationships really are.  They are complicated, they are NOT simple.  There were very few faults I could find with this film.  The only one that I felt somewhat was that it seemed a little long.  Tim Robbins, and Catherine Zeta Jones also make some good cameos.  And the movie has the coolest ending credits I have ever seen in a film.Needless to say, this is the best movie I have seen this year so far.Rating 9 out of 10.",High Fidelity
97,mhasheider,Sweet and wickedly funny.,9,14 March 2001,"A sweet and wickedly funny tale of Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a struggling music store owner who deals with his two assistants: Barry (Jack Black), who is basically a nutcase and Dick (Todd Louiso), who is the opposite and presents himself as quiet and easygoing.  Rob, Dick, and Barry spend their days in the store, constantly talking about any type of music.However, Rob is emotionally crushed when his latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), dumps him for Ian (Tim Robbins), a quiet man who has the appearence of a neat freak.  When Ian comes into the store one day and talks to Barry, Rob, and Dick in a calm manner.  Each one has a fantasy of their own which consists of verbally chewing out Ian and scaring him away or beating the living daylights out of him.  I must admit that scene made me both laugh and cringe for a short moment.""High Fidelity"" marks the reunion between Cusack and the British director, Stephen Frears (""The Hit""), who made ""The Grifters"" in 1990 with Cusack in one of the lead roles.John Cusack is great here and in some scenes, he talks directly to the screen about some of the real-life facts in Chicago, where the film was made in, but the novel by Nick Hornsby was done in London.  Chicago and London look very similar even though both cities are in different countries.Besides Cusack, there are some great supporting performances turned in by Black and Louiso, who seemed more interesting out of the duo.  Hjejle is solid here as the girlfriend.  Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic"")and singer Bruce Springsteen appear here in cameos.Composer Howard Shore conducts a solid score and the photography by Seamus McGarvey is simply brilliant.""High Fidelity"" may be one of Cusack's best films and those people who head the Academy should do themselves a big favor - give Cusack an Oscar.",High Fidelity
98,michaelradny,"High In Laughs, High In Love",7,6 September 2015,"What I like about High Fidelity was the fact that the humour was really well done and the story didn't feel boring and clichéd; at least at first thought. In my personal opinion, the first half of this film is fantastic, funny and sophisticated. The second half of this film fell quite flat with that typical romantic comedy storyline which seems to plague most of these films. But all in all, the film ends up being decent, leaves a slightly bad taste in your mouth at the end, but you will reminisce the first half to make it better. Good for the most part, but I very much dislike the final half hour. It seemed unnecessary and boring, but above all clichéd and typical. But if you get your hands on this film, the glory is the first hour; that is comedy that you will never see in a film again!",High Fidelity

The director is very good and so are the actors - even though I wanted to kick Jack Black's character in the teeth right after he made his obnoxious entrance, and kept on wanting to for the whole film.And of course the music; and to complete the package, a cameo from the Boss Bruce Springsteen, giving Rob some advice.Don't miss this!

Jack Black's character is an amazing addition in the humour aspect; the 'Evil Dead' conversation is amusing.

101,dallasryan,Why We Love John Cusack,8,1 June 2015,"John Cusack was born to play roles like these. He is the 'every man', the guy we all relate to. I think it was fate that Cusack has never gotten married because it's added to his appeal with these kind of down on your luck-likable-lovelorn-schlub characters that he plays. High Fidelity is an honest look at a relationship, at all the different angles, views, Point of views of a relationship. It's honest in its eccentric way by saying the protagonist even messes up, as Cusack's character admits that he cheated on his girlfriend in the film. Most movies would never have the protagonist cheat, most movies would have him/her be perfect, where this is a movie about a real human being, a human being that is likable, but who messes up and throughout his soul search journey he starts seeing all of the things he was doing wrong on, all of the things that are wrong within himself. A movie true to form, in it's eccentric, story telling way. John Cusack is a good actor. He always plays himself (even though he's probably playing different characters , but we always just see him playing himself). I think a great actor plays himself well (meaning 'what if I was in this situation', 'what if i was in that situation' and that's very tough to do believably), but yet he can play other characters too, which I've never seen Cusack play anyone but himself. Cusack is extremely good at playing himself in all of the different circumstances he's in, in each film he's in. And because he always plays himself, I believe that also adds to his likable appeal. He's got extreme likability and we always love to watch him.This is a very good film, with great acting, great music, very funny all around. A must see.",High Fidelity
102,The_Core,Occasional laughs punctuate the boredom,6,27 January 2003,"Yes, I did laugh occasionally here and there... but the fact is that these characters are pathetic.  Rob (John Cusack) is completely possessive/obsessive and self centered, unable to be vulnerable or caring even for a moment -- his string of failed relationships is obvious and understandable, as is his self-pity (he really is as worthless as he feels himself to be).  Nobody (at least nobody I can think of) could like or relate to this guy, or the people he works with at ""Championship Vinyl.""Unfortunately, liking and/or identifying with the characters is necessary in a character-driven film like this... so it becomes an exercise in tedium almost immediately.  Although not without some redeeming qualities, even being a vinyl fan (like myself) doesn't save the picture from its own leaden weight and banal predictability.  6/10",High Fidelity

Like him, this is not my type of music so I missed many of the in-jokes, but the same kind of elitist snobbery shown by Rob and his help can be found among people in many areas.Dykstra's point about the Barry character being a mite improbable (to connect with an audience as a performer, given his previous track record) is well-taken.  But that doesn't bother me much because Rob's conflict of commitment, his very prolonged adolescence -- and his final summing up and resolution of it -- analyzed and laid bare that dilemma with a clarity and truthfulness that I've never before seen in movies.  (Would that all people, men _or_ women -- with similar immaturity/insecurity problems with relationships -- could resolve them with the insight Rob's character finally showed.)   Cusack and all the supporting actors fit well in their roles and did fine jobs.  It's a really good film and you don't have to be familiar with the current pop music scene to enjoy it (that  could only add more pleasure).",High Fidelity

You might get away with it if it was funny, along the 4 Weddings & a Funeral line. Unfortunately there wasn't one laugh in this from any of us. You might also have got away with the idea if it was very moving or maybe had a surprise ending, neither of which happened here.I never remotely cared or liked any character in this, the time scale & flashbacks didn't appear to always be coherent, (the scenes could've been put together in any order) I found the Jack Black character one of the most annoying in any film ever (maybe he was meant to be, but he irritated me almost as much as the bird in Blair Witch Project). As a 20something male, none of Rob's behaviour struck any cords with me. The viewers that enjoyed this, females especially, would've been happy regardless of which woman he ended up with.It's not John Cusack that I don't like.

105,Shiva-11,One of Cusack's top five performances.,7,2 April 2000,"High Fidelity: Rob Gordon is the owner of an alternative record store, who along with his two co-workers, spends his time making up top-five lists and generally coasting through life.  As he sifts through the debris of another relationship that has crashed and burned, he slips into a deep blue funk. Unable to figure why he keeps failing at love he decides to contact the women involved in his worst break-ups and ask them to answer his question ""What is wrong with me?""   Of course, he may not be ready for the answer.John Cusack has proven himself as a versatile actor in a variety of roles ranging from ""Say Anything"" to ""Being John Malkovich"".  Funny, intense, quirky, and generally likeable he appeals to many viewers, and this role is no exception.  Rob is a composite of many guys I have known (including me) and rings true: the quintessential confused post-breakup male who is not yet cynical enough to abandon all hope of finding the perfect person, but ego-bruised enough to try and ""fix himself"".  Whenever the soliloquies or subject matter are getting too heavy, Jack Black steps in as the comic relief pinch-hitter.To say that Barry  -one of the eclectic employees at Championship Vinyl - is frantic is a gross understatement.  He could be the poster child for Ritalin.  Pompous, unrelenting, and possessed of a mean streak a mile wide, he is also hilarious and there is never a dull moment when he is on screen (luckily for Cusack it is not that often).

Unfortunitely the film is so much worse and lacks in the books narrative which may have been one of the best things about the book, it also simply cuts out everything in the middle of the book and simply goes for the stuff in the first five chapters and the last five. They also make it into more of a romantic comedy than the book was. The casting is pitch perfect, John Cusack is the person I thought of when I read the book, Jack Black and is amazing as Barry as is Catherine Zeta Jones but unfortunately Joan Cusack lacks life, and John Cusack is an actor who needs a great director to really work well and although greatly cast lacks the great director, and so he just really doesn't work. As I said this is a really badly directed movie, and that is part of what ruined it. The visual effects are pretty good but not that good.

It's beautifully directed, and there is simply not a single line wasted in the film; it's one of those movies that are instantly destined for cult status, because it seems to resonate with anyone who is deeply immersed in - and passionate about - pop culture (in other words: nerds like me ;-).

112,danielll_rs,We still need the eggs,8,2 December 2000,"HIGH FIDELITY (2000)  ***½Stephen Frears' romantic comedy HIGH FIDELITY is one of the few movies you should see in this crappy year of 2000, full of disasters as HANGING UP and BATTLEFIELD: EARTH. I guess it will be my favorite comedy of the year and will probably figure out on my top 10. One interesting detail is that it doesn't have deep significances and don't blow your mind, but it is certainly one of the most honest films I've ever seen.Woody Allen's superb ANNIE HALL (one of my personal favorites) served as a base for every romantic comedy that was made after it, leaving the sweet aura of the ingenuous (but delightful) films starring Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Doris Day, Cary Grant etc. to focus on more realistic situations (every genre was adapting to that, indeed). It is true that ludicrous and shameful situations were treated as realistic in the 80s' and 90s', but in 1989 WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... followed ANNIE HALL's steps and became critically acclaimed and a box-office hit. Now, more than a decade after WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... and 23 years after ANNIE HALL, HIGH FIDELITY is another perfect example that romantic comedies don't need to be sappy or sentimental. It is not a masterpiece as the 1977 Oscar winner and wasn't a hit as the 1989 best original screenplay nominee, but it has witty lines, great acting, some originality and much honesty, and it is very funny.Based on the acclaimed book by English author Nick Hornby, HIGH FIDELITY is set in Chicago- and not in London, as in the book. The main character is Rob Gordon (John Cusack), an ordinary man who owns a decadent vinyl shop and has just been left by his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle). He loves music, and sometimes confuses this passion with his love for women. He and his two weird employees are always making top 5 lists of everything related to music. But he decides to make his top 5 of the women who dumped him. While he suffers with his situation and his past memories, he gets involved with a singer and tries to bring Laura back to him- even though she is dating the nasty and weird Ian (Tim Robbins).There is place for many hilarious scenes- my favorite one is when Ian is talking to Rob at his shop, and he imagines what to do with the rival- and many witty lines as well. The screenplay is clever and very well written and Stephen Frears shows once again that he can do everything- from DANGEROUS LIAISONS and THE GRIFTERS to this film. The cast is full of stars in small appearances- Tim Robbins, Lily Taylor, Joan Cusack and the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones (in her best performance) are some of them. But the real star is John Cusack, who deserves an Oscar nominee for his role. He was incredible in THE GRIFTERS and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and has his second best performance here (the best was in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY). But you have to like him and his character to truly enjoy the film, especially because Rob literally talks to the camera. To make everything better, the soundtrack is great: delightful, nostalgic and feel good.HIGH FIDELITY is a movie about relationships and (as I said) even if it doesn't have deep significances, it is worthy of discussion. With a realistic view of modern relationships between men and women, all the characters have their importance. Rob is the perfect portrait of the Gen-X guy, with his ideas, beliefs and lots of trouble. Even if the movie doesn't know when to quit in the last 20 minutes, I highly recommend it. It's not very common to watch a romantic comedy that is honest, original, hilarious, ironic, bittersweet, delightful... and romantic at the same time. And it is also something we can relate to (many times I feel like Rob).As Alvyn Singer says in ANNIE HALL, after he tells a joke about a man whose brother thinks he is a chicken: ""Well, I guess that's pretty much how I feel about relationships. You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd, but I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs."" Yes! We need the eggs!",High Fidelity
113,llihilloh,A film with about five laughs.,3,23 December 2002,"Once again it just so happens that the movie that I think is terrible turns out to be a hit not only among other viewers, but with tons of critics as well.  'High Fidelity' is a boring film with very few laughs.I rented this film for one reason and one reason only:  John Cusack.  I haven't seen Cusack in too many films, but once I did manage to catch him in something, I was immediately interested in seeing him again. 
Cusack is good, very good, but unfortunately, he can't save this disaster. I was a little surprised to find out that he also co-produced and wrote for 'High Fidelity.'  Iben Hjejle is terrible and annoying.  I guess that's a little harsh, but I just didn't care for her one bit.  Todd Louiso and Jack Black are funny.  Black made me laugh a couple of times.  The cast itself was a disappointment, but Cusack is great by himself.I expected 'High Fidelity' to be quite funny, as the video box read that it should hit the top-five list (with a bullet).  I managed to laugh maybe five times, if that.  As I said, Black was somewhat funny, but I really only laughed once or so at Cusack's jokes.  Bottom line is that this movie is not to be rented if one is looking to actually laugh.So, the acting is pretty good, but the actors aren't that enjoyable except for John Cusack.  Laughs are very few and far between.  The writing is pretty dull in general.  Don't be fooled, I would definitely pass on this bomb.",High Fidelity
114,jmillerdp,"Great Movie, Messed Up Character!",9,18 October 2015,"It's a great movie! Lots of great music and great characters. But, it is pretty difficult to sympathize with John Cusack's character. He is definitely self-centered and thoroughly self absorbed. Cusack's character mellows enough by the ending to make him certainly more tolerable than he was at the beginning.But, everything else works great. The script is by four screenwriters, including Cusack. Regardless, it all clicks, which you wouldn't expect from a screen writing-by-committee production.The big discovery in this film was Jack Black. And, it's great to see what Black was like when he was full of boundless energy, instead of his more-subdued self today. The rest of the cast is very good too!The original novel was based in England, and was transplanted to Chicago for the film. It works well, and you have to love the talk of vinyl between all the characters, especially since vinyl is currently making the resurgence it is.Recommended for those who love a good movie, and can put up with Cusack's character while he grows up during the film!********* (9 Out of 10 Stars)",High Fidelity
115,kergillian,A rare gem! A perfect ten!,10,14 May 2001,"I don't often think of a film as complete, or even near-perfect, but this one is damn close! Very respectful of the book (and I never thought a transplant from the UK to Chicago would work!), this film relates the story from print to tape in a way that's exceedingly rare these days. It took what it needed and knew when to let go of unnecessary scenes, which is all too often a missing factor in book to film translations.John Cusack is, IMHO, the most under-rated actor in Hollywood. I've loved his work since 16 Candles, and I can't think of a film offhand that he's in that I don't like. From the best teen film ever made (Say Anything) to outstanding dramas like the Grifters and Being John Malkovich and comedies like Grosse Pointe Blank, there's something about Cusack that just lights up a screen. He doesn't over act, he doesn't steal scenes from other actors...he's *always* on! And this film is no exception; it's hard to believe that this film wasn't written specifically for him (and being an absolute music geek and self-professed obsessed vinyl addict in real life, he wasn't stretching too far, either;)And the supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant! Todd Louiso and Jack Black are magnificent as the loner vinyl-shop geekboys, and they play beautifully off of each other and Cusack as well (the Cusack & co. vs. Tim Robbins scenes were *hilarious*!!) And John's sis Joan played perfectly off of him as well. In fact the chemistry between all supporting characters was quite good; Bonet, Zeta-Jones, Gregson Wagner and Lili Taylor all worked really well with Cusack, and Tim Robbins was  *very* amusing. I do wish that the adorable Sara Gilbert had a bigger role though;)Iben Hjejle was the only rotten apple here. The woman simply cannot act. She displays barely an ounce of emotion (not to mention a completely monotonous voice) and her expressiveness is less than impressive (non-existent?). If her role was at all important as anything other than a catalyst for the story, she might well ruin the film. But the scenes with her are all inevitably saved by Cusack, and don't last long enough to spoil the film.Overall: The soundtrack rocks (*love* that Beta Band song!;). The film is a perfect length. It reflects the book beautifully. It's a boon to vinyl freaks (like me;). The acting is incredible, and Cusack is at his absolute best here! And for God's sake it's got Bruce Springsteen in it!!

116,matija-trost,PLEASE RATHER READ THE BOOK!!!,3,29 December 2001,"Why?Well, firstly, it's one of the the best books in modern era. Like a Selinger's ""Catcher in the rye"" for the 60's generation. And, secondly, you'll see, what could a more capable director did with this movie. No offence, Stephen.Since I read the book before the movie, I certainly expected more funny scenes (for instance, when the main character goes to the movies with his parents and how he comments this event) and maybe a stronger dramatization. I'm not even to sure, if I would put John Cusack for a lead role. While others, especially the guys who worked with him, were much more appropriate.On the other hand, there is a scene (you know, the one with alternate ending, with ""aircondition fight scene"") who laughs my pants out. But, sadly, this was the only thing that was above average in this movie.

I was depressed and thoroughly miserable and I must have watched this movie every night for at least two weeks.  While it didn't get me back together with my girlfriend, it certainly cheered me up and put a big smile on my face.  It also gave me a different perspective on relationships and how to handle them easier.  There is no plot here.  The movie opens with Rob getting dumped by his girlfriend, Laura. He then proceeds to tell the viewer about his all time top five break-ups, in chronological order.  We get flashbacks of his four most important breakups, starting when he was fourteen.  We also get to see Rob's record shop, which ""attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers"". Dick and Barry are his employees who chase off what few customers the store brings in.  You see, these guys consider themselves musical experts and anyone who doesn't meet their standard of musical knowledge is refused service.  The films biggest laughs come from Rob's self-deprecating remarks and Barry's antics in the store.  Jack Black plays Barry and I'm looking forward to seeing him in more stuff.  He really shines here as the obnoxious clerk who was hired for three days a week but shows up every day.  Dick (Todd Louiso) is the quiet one who looks a lot like Moby with his skinny body and bald head.  His meek, shy manner is the polar opposite of Barry.  His facial expressions are very amusing and his and Barry's arguements are hilarious. 
The film moves along at a nice leisurely pace, without ever getting boring, as Rob attempts to find out what keeps going wrong and why he is forever doomed at relationships.  Amidst all of this, he discovers the musical talents of a couple of skater/punks he busted for shop-lifting.  Barry (who doesn't play any musical instruments) forms a band called the Sonic Death Monkeys and Dick finds a girlfriend.  Rob is also insanely jealous over Laura's new boyfriend, Ian (none other than a pony-tailed Tim Robbins).  Ian is the kind of pretentious, new-age fruit-loop that Rob strongly dislikes and (in this case) hates with a purple passion.  He has only one confrontation with Ian and, done three different ways, it is one of the film's funniest scenes.  I've always been a huge John Cusack fan. Ever since I was seven years old, ""Better Off Dead"" has been one of my favorite comedies since I was old enough to laugh and ""One Crazy Summer"" follows close behind.   While many stars who got their start in the eighties have faded out, Cusack has really come into his own by finding (and in this case co-writing) good, challenging material that continues to show what a good actor he really is.",High Fidelity

This odd but appealing film has a large and tremendously appealing cast, from Cusack himself to the two music nerds who work in his record store (Todd Louiso and Jack Black), to his girlfriends and ex girlfriends, too numerous to identify here.  The movie's best features are its funny surprises and believable characters.  It is clear that it is based on a Nick Hornby novel.

120,m_madhu,"Excellent comedy, true to the book",8,6 October 2001,"this is a delightful movie that has many extremely funny moments, and a few touching ones too. a romantic comedy which is very different from the regular run of the mill ones. this is because its based on a brilliant book by Nick hornby, having already read the book, the movie at times tended to be a bit stale bacause almost every line in the movie is from the book.this is a touching, witty & funny story about a record shop owner, how he gets dumped by his girlfriend and how he discovers himself and finally at 30something grows up.the movie in itself is quite enjoyable an entertaining, the book though is simply extraordinary and id recommend it ahead of the book. after u've enjoyed the book, you could watch the movie anyway. the movie fails in not capturing some of the things going through the protagonists head - come to think of it, it is difficult capture all of the complexities anyway and the movie has done a good job of capturing the core of the movie.

121,eastbergholt2002,Smart and Funny,9,2 December 2006,"High Fidelity is smart and funny. I liked the book but the film is even better. Rob Gordon (John Cusack)is the owner of a struggling record store in Chicago. He's a thirty-something rock-snob who judges people according to the music they like. Rob is a man who refuses to put away childish things. He is someone many of us thought about becoming, before we decided it was simpler to just join the rat race. When Rob's girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) leaves he begins to re-examine his life. Laura is a lawyer who decides she wants a boyfriend with more than an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music and believes that Rob has failed to become an adult. Rob wants Laura back, but is happy with his dead-end career and his music obsession. He's also afraid of committing to one women. Rob tracks down former girlfriends to find out why his relationships with women have not worked out. He attributes it largely to being dumped in college by Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones). John Cusack is perfect as Rob, but all the actors do a brilliant job. There is an exceptional performance from Jack Black, who has tended to ham it up in subsequent movies. The book's London locale is switched to Chicago and it works. This is a great movie.",High Fidelity

All the other parts are cast good as well, but Cusack really stands out for me. But the real strength of this film lies in it's source: Hornby's novel is such a recognizable story for music (or pop for that matter) lovers worldwide. Add to that the theme of nostalgic feelings everybody has when thinking about former lovers and you have a story that ""touches"" you in many ways",High Fidelity

124,bburns,One of my top 5 romantic comedies,8,11 June 2000,"John Cusack is one of my favorite actors, largely because of his effortless portrayals of guys like me.  From ""Say Anything"" to ""Bullets Over Broadway"" to ""Being John Malkovich"", he has mastered the portrayal of the over-earnest borderline-obsessive schmuck who thinks too much and does little that is constructive.  And as a screenwriter, he impressed me very much with ""Grosse Pointe Blank"".  So I went to see this film with very high expectations.  I was not disappointed.""High Fidelity"" struck a particular chord with me because I have never had a relationship with a woman last more than eight months before I get dumped (well, I'm the dumpee at least 90% of the time anyway).  But you don't want to know about me, just what I think of the movie.This movie is a thoroughly funny film about being dumped, and being a slacker (having once lived in the Hyde Park section of Austin, I know all about the latter, too).  Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a record store owner in Chicago whose girlfriend Laura has just left him.  He spends the film brooding as to why he is always getting dumped by women, usually for other men.Particularly hilarious are the folk-comedy duo Tenacious D as Cusack's loser employees who spend all their time insulting would-be customers and making top 5 lists.  Also worth mentioning is Tim Robbins in a cameo role as Laura's new boyfriend, who instigates one of the funniest scenes in the film.The film is flawed to a certain degree, Cusack spends more time talking to the camera than to other characters.  While I don't mind that device, using it too much is a bit distracting.  Also there is the fact that Iben Hjejle as Laura is just plain flat.  And the ending is just a little to perfect, happily-ever-after for my taste.But the pro's of this film drastically outweigh the cons.  I rated it an 8 out of 10.",High Fidelity
125,Mr. Pulse,Wonderful Film About Relationships and Character,10,13 September 2000,"I knew I was hooked about forty-five minutes into the film when I realized that I was completely engrossed in John Cusack's Rob Gordan.  He is easily the most fascinating film character I have seen in a long time.  The movie lives and dies by the script and Cusack's performance.  Both succeed.""High Fidelity"" isn't really plot or story driven, it is very much an intimate character piece.  I doubt most people are familiar with films like it, and it wouldn't surprise me if some people were put off by the lack of story.  But fans of intelligent cinema will definitely enjoy this film as an interesting work of character.The script is well-written, the direction strong, and the Cusack-talking-to-the-camera works helps keep the simple story moving.  In a movie so completely about one character what better way to learn about him, than to have him tell us everything about him?The film is filled with obscure musical and pop culture references, funny sight gags, slapstick, dream sequences, and dialogue.  But I really loved the Rob Gordan character.  A lot of speeches and thoughts could have sprung from my mouth, or from someone I know.  Rob Gordan sure seems like a real person.  That's about as high a compliment as I can give ""High Fidelity.""",High Fidelity

On subsequent viewings -- and oddly, after reading the book -- I've come to appreciate High Fidelity much more.John Cusack and Iben Hjelje make an interesting mismatch of a couple, which is the fulcrum of most of the film. Cusack drives her away and then spends the entire time trying to win her back without quite understanding why. He's approaching middle age and has begun to question his choices and his lack of responsibility.In truth, most men reach Cusack's dilemma in their early twenties, but Cusack's Rob is a case of arrested development. Charming though he is, he has to start growing up.The supporting performances are very good, but Jack Black does a star turn as Rob's music-snob employee at his record store.

He employs Dick (Todd Louiso), an introvert and shy guy, and Barry (Jack Black) the antithesis of Dick. Even Rob and his buddies consumed by the music and popular culture, but that not so help much his relationship with either his long time girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) or all his previous. In an attempt to find out why he is so clueless in a relationship, he starts to dig on all his past romantic life and learn how to commit in a serious liaison.`High Fidelity' is a strictly enjoyable film. All the characters perform so natural, came along with the non-novel plot. It is a sure thing so refreshing in the genre.John Cusack plays his role respectfully and so do the rest of the casts.  It is surprising me that Catherine Zeta-Jones as one of the cameo, and she looks so gorgeous and talented as usual.In closing, you will fill a little (or much) distracting by the time you watch `High Fidelity', if you usually could enjoy a plain and typical romantic comedy. Nevertheless, as truth to be told, I really hope there is will be more like this come from Hollywood. 8/10",High Fidelity

Doing this he gets to know himself much better and this makes him able to see what's wrong with his behaviour.Great comedy with outstanding acting performances by John Cusack and Jack Black but also some wonderful music and a funny cameo appearance by Bruce Springsteen.

132,Treyroo,One of Cusack's Best,9,14 April 2013,"What are your passions? Travel, fine food, family and friends? What if you decided to forsake everything else in your life to make a career out of those passions? Looking back, what would you think?Rob Gordon (played by John Cusack) is a lifelong Chicago resident and owner of his own record store. The store, Championship Vinyl, attracts very few window shoppers and almost as few intentional customers. The staff consists of Rob, Barry (played by Jack Black), and Dick (played by Todd Louiso). Originally hired to work two days a week, Barry (Black) and Dick (Louiso) decided instead to show up every day. Their personalities are complete mirror images of each other, Barry being loud and opinionated (one of many reasons that Jack Black was perfect for the role) and Dick being soft-spoken and deferential. What they and Rob have in common with each other is an almost encyclopedic knowledge of music and a superior attitude as a result. When we join the story, Rob is being dumped by his live-in girlfriend, Laura. Laura (played by Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has chosen to leave in the evening and Rob, vehemently opposed to the idea, elects to shout out the window as Laura drives away. Rob then proceeds to list the five most devastating breakups in his romantic past, purposely excluding Laura from the list. Noticing that all those relationships ended at the urging of the other party, Rob decides that he is doomed to be rejected. He reaches out to his first girlfriend, a girl he kissed for two hours a day for three days before finding her kissing someone else on the fourth day. While he fails to find his middle school love, her sister informs him that the boy Rob saw her kissing on the first day is now her husband and that they live in Australia. In fact, the woman he speaks to is under the impression that her sister's husband was actually her first boyfriend. Rob tries to disabuse her of this notion but the sister, believing him to be delusional, hangs up. Rob, now believing that his circumstances are the result of fate and not any sort of failure on his part, plans to reach out to his other former partners. Penny Hardwick (played by Joelle Carter) who would not allow the intimacy between them to progress past kissing, Charlie Nicholson (played by Catherine Zeta- Jones) who rejected him and began a relationship with a coworker, and Sarah Kendrew (played by Lily Taylor) who found the ideal relationship with each other, both having been rejected and fearing they would never find their true soul mate. Sarah found someone else while still with Rob and ended things with absolutely no warning. This is one of those rare comedies that displays truly inspiring performances. Jack Black is, well Jack Black, but he is a valuable addition to the cast and the story. Cusack as Rob plays a character that we lose sympathy for on more than one occasion but ultimately find ourselves rooting for. And, as is typically the case with movies that feature multiple music aficionados as characters, the soundtrack is incredible. Thirteen years have passed since the release of this film and I enjoy it just as much if not more than I did when it was first released. THAT is the mark of true greatness.",High Fidelity

134,shawnmikedryer,Classic Cusack shtick,8,5 January 2021,"Rob Gordon is a nearly 'mid life' crisis man who is growingly more aware of his aging and deep down is quite terrified by it. This former club DJ turned record store owner and proprietor, this is not what you would call a lucrative venture and that sinking realization only seems to be growing on Rob. Being ditched by yet another one of his romantic endeavors, Rob is frequently thrown into this very anal self examining of himself, his actions, and each of his ex lovers true intentions. Which proves to be a process that distorts the shape of his everyday psyche. His daily hurdles seem to be filtered effectively and ineffectively by his two co workers and personal friends who are also as socially inept and probably as inadequate as they appear. In this shop however they live and breathe all the great contemporary music you could dream of which proves to be as uplifting as they can allow at times. Crazily Rob being tormented as much as he is feels the best option is to recall ever last one of his breakups to inquire exactly what went wrong. Can Rob come to grips with his latest 'lost love' and try to build something new or will he stay stagnant in his diluted self-actualizations is the real question.The comedic homage this film pays tribute to the music scene is a great look into the type of film that is truly lacking in this sort of genre, this one surely makes up for that fact. John Cusack plays his bread & butter role that he over the years has been known for and it truly shines here, say what you will but i absolutely love this character Cusack so frequently plays.",High Fidelity
135,Hotoil,"A nice, smooth ride",10,25 November 2000,"This is a really funny, well-made, great film.  They marketed this thing very poorly - when I first saw the trailer in the theaters I thought it would be one movie I would be happy to miss.  A friend of mine snuck it into our selection of movie rentals one night, and I was very pleasantly surprised!I generally like John Cusack, as I am gradually discovering.  I thought ""Gross Point Blank"" was a nice flick, and ""Being John Malkovich"" just blew me away.  This strangely finds it's place in between the two.  I don't know why, but the rhythm of the film is nice, it has many randomly funny parts, it's believable & realistic while being completely outrageous and always enjoyable.  The supporting cast is great, Jack Black stays extremely funny without getting as annoying as the character he plays (if teetering on the edge).The movie has two central themes: relationships and music.  John Cusack is wonderful as he hashes the two out in his mind, for the viewing audience to see and hear.  I admit, this is a risky film.  It could have easily gone bad - it's a great script that needed the perfect lead and a nice cast to really pull it off.  It does.A previous comment mistakenly advises the reader that ""Empire Records"" is a good alternative to this film.  It would probably be best to disregard that suggestion completely.  Unlike Empire Records, with which this movie has about two thin cosmetic similarities, ""High Fidelity"" doesn't come off like a bad sitcom with stereotypical, marketing-induced plots and characters. This is one of John Cusack's best movies indeed! it is smart and simple, has a certain subtle charm, a great cast and a witty and relatable script. Enjoy it!",High Fidelity
136,Figgiedan,High expectations...lower opinion of the film,7,11 April 2000,"I was REALLY looking forward to this film. I'm an avid movie goer but haven't been in months due to the sharp decline in quality that usually happens around post oscar time. Anyhow, there were ideas and events in the film that I really enjoyed, problem was that they were usually only given a moment to mull over, or were treated as one-liners. I thought the lead female was awful and it was an extreme stretch to see the two of them get back together again. The two ""dorks"" at the store were great.. and Top 2,3,4 ""breakup girls"" were all good. I just didn't find any chemistry between his latest breakup and himself. Also, why the hell was it downpouring all the time? And why would a lawyer be hanging out in a seedy club rather than hangin out with Catherine Zeta Jones' character instead? Even John Cusack wasn't very likable at times.. all I know is that it had lots of potential and I would've liked to see how the music influenced these individual characters more. And what kind of music did the female lead like? It's never shown...They only scratched the surface of the record on this one....go see ""Being John Malkovich"" again.  7 out of 10. C-.

139,Blondie_,One of the best romance movies out there!,9,4 August 2005,"I love this movie, have seen it at least several times, and could see it many times more. It is entertaining and funny every single time I see it, that is how great this movie is. Next to 'Say Anything' and 'When Harry Met Sally', it is the best romantic movie out there. For one, the film is very unique in that it portrays a love-lorn man instead of yet another love-lorn woman, as is the case with the majority of romance movies. When was the last time you saw a movie where a man talks about his feelings?? The film has many tender, touching moments without being the least drippy or milquetoast. This is offset by great humor throughout the film. John Cusack shines in the lead role and gives one of best, nuanced performances of his career so far. He is surrounded by a nearly-perfect supporting cast, and my nearly-perfect leads to the one and only criticism of this movie: the character of Laura. The actress who plays here (sorry, I can't remember the spelling of her name right now) gives a mostly dull, uninspiring performance. While Cusack performs perfect chemistry with her, she gives him nearly zero chemistry back. I feel she was the wrong choice in casting for this role. Who I feel should of been cast is Lisa Bonet, who had a small supporting role as one of Cusack's lovers. She totally sparked chemistry-wise with him and they were a perfect on screen couple. Lisa Bonet should of been cast as Laura. But this is just one criticism of an otherwise excellent film, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",High Fidelity
140,eschetic,Decidedly endearing (seek out the flop musical which followed! It's even better!!),7,20 December 2006,"For all the apparent (if modest) success which greeted the release of this film adaptation of Nick Hornby's well remembered British novel about the owner of a second hand record store and his trouble with women and life (some might say ""growing up""), it was a 14 performance (ie. commercially failed) Broadway musical (December 7-17, 2006) by respected playwright David Lindsay-Abaire with composer Tom Kitt and lyricist Amanda Green (daughter of Adolph) which first brought me to the movie to explore how the adaptation had been done. The movie proved droll and endearing and captured most of the best lines and situations which later highlighted the more focused stage piece. Even better, the DVD release fleshed out several of the characters through the always welcome ""deleted scenes"" bonuses and very interesting interviews with film director Stephen Frears. While the movie moves the action from author Hornby's more atmospheric London to Chicago (presumed Middle-America appeal? The later musical would further relocate the action to Brooklyn), the essence of the characters is international: the ""slacker"" who is satisfied with his life and doesn't want to change a thing, the friends who both want him to and (even when they don't want to) are changing their own lives around him and the fast dying world of the passionate record (LP) collector (but you could substitute ANY collection and the story would be as valid).Ultimately, we see him find that he must change to truly remain the same, and if the details (not to be revealed here) are mildly mundane, they are also believable and well acted. Other authors (BILLY LIAR) have taken the story in other directions - the hero refuses to change when led to the brink and falling back, but they were ultimately tragedies. This is a life affirming comedy. A happy story that wants to make us feel ""grownup"" and largely succeeds. I've never been a real John (or Joan) Cusack fan, but both are at their peak form here. (Joan is the old friend who is a good enough friend to call John every name in the book and embarrass him in front of a new friend or client when she discovers he's done something to his girlfriend, Iben Hjejle, which already makes him feel as guilty as possible). They are joined by a well chosen supporting cast. Jack Black is quietly perfect as the wanna-be rock-star record clerk who is infuriatingly ""pure"" in his tastes. Lisa Bonet and Sara Gilbert are essentially thrown away in parts almost too small to be remembered.The old stage technique of having the lead break the ""fourth wall"" and speak directly to the audience (ala Jerry Orbach in the stage PROMISES, PROMISES or Matthew Broderick in the FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF movie) is perfect for this story which could just as well have been an entirely interior monologue in Cussack's head illustrated by scenes from his memory. The feel is refreshing and comfortable.If ultimately I found myself preferring the later musical which flopped (for any number of reasons - not enough people identifying with LP collectors, poor direction, no identifiable stars and ticket prices ranging from $41 to $111) it is largely because those authors sharpened the story and made it flow even better than the multiple screenwriters (including Cusack) and director Frears had in the motion picture and the later piece added a fine original score with excellent first time lyrics from Green. As of this writing the score has been recorded for release by Sh-k-boom (Ghostlight) Records in May, 2007, so fans of the movie might want to further explore this later incarnation.Those who have not yet enjoyed the movie shouldn't expect a high powered knock-about roller coaster of hilarity. This is a low powered, intimate charmer with real humor which will ultimately warm your heart. How it merited an ""R"" rating is anyone's guess - I'm sure Frears thought it would help business with late teens. It's worth risking a couple hours (114 minutes) of your time no matter what your age.",High Fidelity
141,sbox,Cusack's Shtick is Wearing Thin,3,27 March 2001,"WARNING:  Spoilers ahead.John Cusack has been portraying the nice, cool, yet loveless underdog, for almost twenty years.  Enough!Yes, these films work on a basic level.  After all, they are formula tested and proven.  However, I'm enraged when I see such films garner wide critical acclaim. The reason is because the storyline of these films are the result of dumpster diving for old material.Let's take a look at Mr. Cusack's similar films.  They include; ""The Sure Thing (1985),"" ""Better Off Dead (1987),"" and ""Say Anything (1989)."" I am sure I am leaving some out but I think you get the drift.  John Cusack has made a good living out of being the nice guy seeking a nice girl.""High Fidelity"" is no different except to say that even at thirty something, nice guys have trouble meeting nice girls.  Perhaps so.  However, I find it troubling to grant such movies some deep meaning mandate.  This is not ""Dr. Zhivago.""  Peppering the film with pop culture and anti-pop culture music references may be ""hip"" with some generation x-ers, who seem to love this kind of crap (see also ""The Wedding Singer""), but it does have real limitations, which Mr. Cusack reached long ago.  Alas, a paycheck is still a paycheck, and folks are still driven into delirium by the bozo formula. The lonely Cusack in the night rain might drive you nuts if you notice how abused it is in this movie.I was impressed by Jack Black's performance as the die hard devotee to the cause of ""music appreciation.""  The viewer see's that Black's character, Barry, is going to love the eighties and the past to the death.  Barry is meant to be the juxtaposition of Cusack's character.  While Barry is content to wallow in the past, Cusack seeks to gain a future.  Unfortunately, Barry is funnier and more believable.  This is because Cusack's real dilemma is not whether or not he will look to the future or the past.  Rather, he only worries if he will find true love.  I could care less if he ever does or doesn't and neither should you.The bottom line is that this film is hopefully the end of the John Cusack unloved puppy series.  Jack Black delivered well and he has a bright future in film.  I rate this rot at three out of ten.",High Fidelity
142,Uthman,Cusack's good acting trashes his character's appeal,5,2 April 2000,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, it being populated by some of my favorite actors (the Cusacks, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tim Robbins, et al) and partially penned by one of my favorite writers (Scott Rosenberg). The problem I (and all the members of my family, including a college-student daughter) had was that Cusack's character elicited absolutely no sympathy. This chain-smoking, self-centered, amoral loser is certainly no one I would wish to get the girl in the end. I like films that bend genre canon as much as the next iconoclast, but this was just too much. I kept waiting for Rob to finally get his comeuppance, but it never happened. As as for the main character, Laura, she is a one-woman ad campaign for Dr. Laura's book on 10 Stupid Things Women Do to mess up their lives. Who can sympathize with a doormat?HIGH FIDELITY does feature some insightful and subtle humor, but the laughs are few and far between, and the film drags not only in the middle but toward the end as well. Fine supporting performances are turned in my numerous cast members, most notably Jack Black, Joan Cusack, and Lili Taylor. The much-touted soundtrack does have some good tunes, but over all I found it very uneven--certainly no EMPIRE RECORDS in that regard.I would echo other comments here to the effect that this is not the kind of movie one would take a date to, at least with the intention of fostering romantic ideation.

John Cusack offers a fine performance as vinyl record store owner Rob Gordon, and overall the acting is very good.Jack Black and Todd Louiso are standouts as Rob's over-the-edge employees, and Iben Hjejle (how do you pronounce that?!?) is genuine and attractive as the primo love interest (Laura).This is the kind of ""little"" movie that can be endearing to some.  It won't exactly rock your world, and will probably do only modestly at the box office.",High Fidelity
147,~AleXa~,"Entertaining and innovatively comedic, but emotionally shallow",6,14 June 2005,"It's interesting that they present the main character as more or less an asshole, and we might otherwise just write him off, but his complete and utter honesty is his redeeming quality. John Cusack and Jack Black play off each other wonderfully. Rob's (Cusack) quest for self- discovery, starting off by focusing outward and eventually turning inward, is more or less the point and purpose of the film, brilliantly executed with humor in all the right places. But in spite of its honest nature, the film remains undeniably lacking in character and emotional depth.VERDICT: Entertaining as well as a nice change of pace from traditional comedies. Recommended to all, particularly John Cusack fans or anyone on the prowl for an innovative comedy, with the exception that you don't mind narrative films (Rob discusses his most inner thoughts while looking directly into the camera through about half of it).6.0 out of 10.0~AleXa~",High Fidelity
148,tbabe29,CO-STARS Outshine Cusack in this self absorbed comedy,6,2 April 2000,"The co-stars (too many too list) who play in this romantic-comedy-I-guess, are far more interesting than our central character played by Cusack. Cusack plays a record store owner who spends the whole movie whining about his failed love life.  For the first 40 minutes of it, I hung in there, waiting for our main character to show SOME character.  After that, I begin to look at my watch.The problem with High Fidelity, is that our main character is too much of jerk to like.  He is totally selfish and immature for his age and his habits are a complete afront to women.  I was okay with that, at first. But a shallow main character can't carry a picture all the way through without showing SOME promise along the way. This is supposed to be OUR guy. We are supposed to be rooting for him the whole way through. But after awhile, I just wished that one of his many ex-girlfriends would have shot him in the head and put us all out of our misery.  John Cusack's character has no perspective or enough depth to carry a movie. John, GET A REAL PROBLEM.I was insulted, because Cusack was potraying someone my age and it just makes our generation look useless.  Cusack finally does get his act together at the VERY END of the movie. Not soon enough. And I never really believed he was a lover of music.  He didn't have the passion for it the way his employees at the record store did. They were believable.  Cusack could have been a shoe salesman for all we know. He says a few snappy lines about music trivia and owns a lot of vinyl, but he just doesn't ""fit"" the part.  He would have been more believable if he cut his hair, put on a suit and played a RECORD LABEL EXECUTIVE.THANK GOD for his co-stars. They were excellently cast and offered plenty of comic relief to break up the monotony of Cusack's pathetic love life and his journey to ""find himself"". If they had let this movie play dark all the way through and then killed Cusack at the end, I would have liked it better. But the Hollywood ending was so cliche I wanted to VOMIT PROFUSELY. They spend the whole movie trying to sound ""INDIE"" and they have that cheesy ending...LOTS OF SHALLOW LAUGHS, BUT IGNORE CUSACK.",High Fidelity
149,Ysman,A great movie from an incredible book . . .,9,7 April 2000,"Cusack delivers a flawless adaptation of Nick Horby's great novel High Fidelity.  Every once in a while a movie comes along where you can totally identify with the characters.  These are my friends, music and movie snob-geeks with contempt for anything labeled ""popular"".  We are the guys who grew up watching too much television, listening to too much music, and watching too many movies.  We were tricked to think that life without misery was no life at all.  We were fooled into thinking all romances were story book and that all of life's problems can be wrapped up in thirty minutes or less.  Unfortunately, we set out to find relationships that resembled those we thought were normal and when these relationships went south, we spent way too much time obsessing and reliving them.

After a painful breakup, he decides to go over his girlfriends of the past to find out why they rejected him. The supporting cast is stellar. Jack Black and Todd Louiso are perfectly cast as Cusack's goofy employees, Lily Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones are wonderful as two of Cusack's ex-girlfriends, Lisa Bonet, a far way from her COSBY SHOW days is wonderful as a singer, Iben Hjejle is good as the girl who just broke up with him.

Not earthshocking though.,7,12 September 2000,"What set High Fidelity apart for me, was the fact that John Cusack's character evoked my sympathy even though he had few redeeming characteristics. I also particularly liked the narration style which consisted largely of John Cusack talking to the camera, it reminded me of Scorsese's Goodfellas. And i was happy to see that there was no overly sentimental, sugarcoated ending, which would have ruined the film's moody atmosphere.",High Fidelity

The narration-style has been done before a couple of times (remember Goodfellas?) but it's still a nice touch. Good acting all round. Well not all round as i found Catherine Zeta Jones a little out of place, i didn't care much for her 'acting', she very pleasing to the eye but that's about it in my opinion. Some very funny scenes with the two store clerks, excellent casting.",High Fidelity
154,world_of_weird,Overstays its welcome by about an hour,3,7 November 2005,"The problem with HIGH FIDELITY is that it's already starting to look dated, and it's only five years old. The core problem is that it emerged from a very late-nineties cultural phenomena, that of the 'new lad' (i.e. men who think it's okay to be self-serving, self-indulgent slobs who treat women like dirt then laugh about it with their stagnant social circle over a beer) and its worthless offspring, 'lad-lit' (as in literature), which got a bunch of narrow-minded book critics raving over the ability of mediocre hacks like Nick Hornby and David Baddiel to pad a life of porn videos, football matches and failed relationships out to the length of a slim paperback. Another core problem with lad literature is its nerdy obsessiveness. Hornby could fill page after page with anally-retentive statistics regarding his favourite football team in the name of ""authenticity"", and nobody complained once. Bret Easton Ellis did a similar thing when he listed is-he-or-isn't-he psycho Patrick Bateman's endless array of gadgets and gizmos in American Psycho, but he was at least poking fun at the vacuous consumerism of the yuppie crowd - with Hornby, it all seemed depressingly real, as if he honestly believed people gave a stuff about what an anorak his lead character was. (I dread to think how many tedious conversations he's been cornered into by similarly inadequate football geeks.) HIGH FIDELITY does itself no favours by relocating the story to Chicago and getting John Cusack to play himself yet again (though I'll always think of him as playing his Better Off Dead character when confronted with this kind of shtick, but that's another story), but the real problem is that the film is way too long. It would have been entertaining as a one-hour TV special, but at its current length it drags, particularly after the halfway mark when the screenplay really seems to drag its heels, throwing in endless diversions and sub-plots that lead nowhere. And maybe I'm being overly picky, but would a music snob like Cusack's character really like someone as populist as Bruce Springsteen? Surely he'd have gone for Tom Petty, who did at least sing a lot of songs about girls rather than cars or redemption by water or whatever nonsense 'the Boss' is grumbling about half the time? Ah well...",High Fidelity
155,garthlotel,Walking on Sunshine,8,1 March 2018,"This film is worth watching for Jack Black alone. But it's also a refreshingly real, funny and honest look at the modern man and relationships.",High Fidelity
156,mercury-26,"good movie, better book",7,4 April 2000,"John Cusack's latest manic love story is not only based on Nick Hornby's novel of the same name, but nearly copies the book word for word.  When I read the book a couple of years ago, I remember thinking what a great movie it would make. When I heard that John Cusack would be starring in sort of an Americanized version, I could see it. Just the right fit.
Now that I've seen the finished product, which is pretty much what I envisioned, I'm a bit disappointed. For one thing, I didn't expect Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, to talk into the camera all the way through the movie.  I thought they'd find a more inventive way to show the inner workings of this thoroughly confused person's mind.  Nearly every time Rob is talking to another character, he'll turn to the camera and give us his thoughts, sort of including us in the conversation.  I'm all for innovative filmmaking, but this just seems like a cop-out to me.  We like movies because they find ways to show what's going on in a person's head through their interaction with others and their behavior.  If they'd cut Rob's monologues, the film would have been a half hour long.  This type of blatant exposition is becoming a problem in the industry as a whole:  too many thought-revealing voice-overs and other conversations that sound like someone reading from an encyclopedia.Not that high fidelity is a bad movie.  It's actually very amusing most of the time and I'm sure if I hadn't read the book, I'd have enjoyed it more. Music and the intense emotions behind it create the film's landscape.  It's fun to watch the arguments over what songs belong in a certain `top five' list. In fact, Rob and his employees, Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), have a Top Five songs for every life situation.  For example: when Rob's girlfriend's father dies, they create a `top five songs about death' as a tribute to the man, which is the only way they know how to express their sympathy.  The result of all the lists and mix tapes is a very eclectic mix of music of all styles and from all eras.  It's proof that when you mix it all together, you find that the old stuff is just as cool or, more times than not, cooler than the new stuff.Rob's Top Five All-Time Worst Breakups is the list on which the entire story is based.  He uses it to deal with his frustration over his latest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle).  This is one area in which the film improves upon the book:  Laura's character is more fully developed here.  Rob comes up with the list just so he can leave her off of it, to prove how little she really mattered to him (when in fact, she's the love of his life).  High-profile actresses Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Lisa Bonet take small roles as the other loved and lost women of Rob's life.  Rob is not an easy guy to like, the way he uses these poor women just to sort his own feelings out.Seeing the film version makes me want to go back and read the book, a format in which the narrator is welcome to express his feelings right to the audience.  If you're about to go and see the movie, don't.  Read the book instead or at least read it first and then see the film if you must.  So consider this the official warning:  the book is better. 
Grade:  C+",High Fidelity
157,pleiades10,Very clever movie.,8,12 December 2000,"I'd like to say that at least in the northern Virginia area, ""Hi Fidelity"" is mis-marketed. A local ad that entices you into ordering it on pay per view, shows a great scene... the ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" scene, and that's it. From this clip, I thought it was to be a laugh-a-minute film. It's not.  This is not to say I didn't like it, I just didn't EXPECT what I got. But I quickly found myself absorbed by the plot, the great characters, and the realistic scenarios entailing day-to-day life. Sure, there are some funny moments, like when John Cusack is confronted by Ian, the new boyfriend of his OLD girlfriend, and he plays through several increasingly hilarious ways he could deal with the confrontation... but primarily, Hi Fidelity succeeds in Cusack's portrayal of a lonely man that searches for resolution to his ""top five all time WORST break ups"", including his most recent one with Laura, played wonderfully by Iben Hjejle. The supporting cast is great, and lots of great in-jokes and references to classic pop, rock, and soul artists abound. Jack Black's role as Barry, the slobby, but savant-like record store employee, steals the show when he sings a very soulful rendition of Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get It On"", and look for Sara Gilbert in a bit part as Anna, a customer who connects with the timid Dick, played by Todd Louiso.",High Fidelity
158,majic-5,A Tasty Ham on Wry Sandwich,8,23 December 2005,"To derive maximum enjoyment from this film, you must (a) be male, (b) have gone through an extended period of trying to figure out why you couldn't keep a girlfriend (c) love a talky, monologous movie. Women who find John Cusack adorable will also like this film.There are three major selling points for High Fidelity. The first is the novel technique of mixing 1/3 traditional narrative with 2/3 talking directly to the audience (that's ""breaking the fourth wall"" for you dramatists). Usually, I hate this technique, because it indicates a lazy/untalented scriptwriter who couldn't figure out how to get his points across skillfully. But the technique works here (for the most part), because the script is intelligent. It made me remember back to the dreadful period in my and my friend's lives where we experimented to reconcile our preconceptions of relationships with what we actually wanted, and what the women we dated seemed to want (they were doing the same thing, you know).But a good script needs good execution, and Cusack's believability and likability are the film's second selling point. By the time he'd made High Fidelity, Cusack had perfected the blending of being earnest and wry. In fact, I think Julliard has added a ""Ham on Wry"" course just to study his technique. In this film, he adds the right amount of youthful, rebellious surliness required for his character. His skills as a monologist are impressive, and I'd like to see him take to the stage for a show.The third selling point is the performances of the supporting cast. Rob and his two record store employees (who show up twice as often as Rob hired them for) are pop music snobs who desperately need to develop their lives. Todd Louiso, plays Dick, the painfully shy and nerdy clerk, pitch perfect. Jack Black scores a bullseye with his obnoxious-funny characterization. (Several times, Joy or I looked at each other after one of his despicable bits and said ""justifiable homicide,"" to which the other nodded.) And Iben Hjejle (no, I don't know how to pronounce this) plays a remarkably complex, level-headed, and unbitter girlfriend with the right amount of maturity and straightness necessary to convince us that Rob might want to grow up enough to be with her.The only nit I'll pick is the absence of rap and hip-hop from the musical vocabulary of the movie. Even if Rob and his buddies hated the genre, they couldn't deny its impact or sales figures. But the film ignores this musical and social category entirely, for reasons never explained.",High Fidelity
159,clydefrogg,Top Five reasons I love this movie,9,23 January 2002,"High Fidelity has become one of my favorite films.  It has, in fact, snuck into the top 10.  Unfortunately, there's just no room for it in the top 5...Anyway, the top 5 is as follows:1. I relate to this film more than any film I've ever seen, as do many guys in their mid 20's, I'm sure.  Of course, I haven't personally been through everything Rob has, but I've been through a lot and I've seen others go through a lot.  On another level, I relate to the snobbery expressed by Rob, Dick and Barry as they look down on those who know less than them.  Not for music, but for film.  And I think anyone who has a knowledge of anything that is far superior to that of the common man can relate to these guys, whether it be music, film, books, cooking, politics, whatever.2. There are a number of great truths in this film.  It is quite possibly the greatest film ever made about the relationships between males and females, at least for our generation.  Rob's wandering and his eventual epiphinies are presented so well, it knocks you over.3. It has great characters.  Rob is an imperfect hero, but it's hard not to love him, nonetheless.  Laura is, on the surface, presented as NOT the ideal for Rob.  But she is great, and boy, he really does love her.  And I think I love her too!  Suffice to say, Jack Black's Barry is a riot and Dick is incredibly painful to watch (in a good way).  I think we've all known guys like this in our lives.  Joan Cusack has only a few short scenes, but she is spectacular, too, and nails her character.  The characters are unforgettable and so is their dialogue.  Don't even get me started on Tim Robbins!4. What a great soundtrack.  I have the CD, and whenever I listen to it (or hear a song from it), which is often, I want to watch the movie.  That's how you know a film has a great soundtrack.  Like Pulp Fiction in that respect, and in the respect that one of the reasons I look forward to watching the movie again and again is because of the music.5. It has a perfect ending.  (SPOILER) Rob proposes to Laura, and she doesn't say yes, she thanks him for asking.  Not your garden variety happy ending, but you're happy anyway because you know things are probably going to turn out alright.  Same for Rob's career as a producer.  He's not exactly setting the world on fire by putting out the record of a couple of skate ****'s, but it's a start.I love this movie, and it's one of my favorites.  I like it more every time I see it, and it gets better every time I see it.  However, I couldn't give it an ""A"" when I first saw it, and I can't give it an ""A"" now.  I give it an ""A-"" for two reasons, things I can't get past.  One, the unforgivable use of rain to heighten the drama.  Not once, but about six times.  Second, what happens in Laura's car after her father's wake.  I just don't buy a girl wanting to do that in that particular situation, time and place. Ever.A great movie, an instant classic, and a tour de force for John Cusack.",High Fidelity
160,Jose E,Amazingly good,8,6 October 2001,"This movie is one of the most original I have ever seen so far. Perhaps I can relate to it more because of the music thing, despite of not being myself into the same stuff played or mentioned there - aside from Bruce Springsteen cameo. That is so cool.I didn't know John Cusack before seeing this film, and I simply enjoy his performance. More than that there's not a lot more I can say about the movie. Just see it if you are in the mood of trying something fresh and different. However, if you are not one of those people who think music is one of the most relevant things in life I don't think you will enjoy High Fidelity.I *only* give this one eight out of ten because I would have made different musical choices, had I been in charge. In any case, the movie is pretty good.",High Fidelity
161,Dkish,Breaking up is funny?,7,1 April 2000,"High Fidelity By Dean Kish	Trying for a Reality Bites type feel we are faced with a comedy about breaking up. This is funny? 	High Fidelity, based on the cult novel by Nick Hornby, is a about a rash, lazy, socially confused, record store owner named Rob Gordon (John Cusack). Rob is faced with the fact he is the king of breaking up and if he doesnt rectify this dilemma soon he will end up alone. 	High Fidelity is a lot like Reality Bites in that we are voyeurs to losers finding love. The difference between Fidelity and Bites is that Fidelity isnt as smart, fresh or nearly as funny. But what saved me in this film was John Cusacks grasp of his character, we havent seen a Cusack like this in a long time. I loved a lot of his anecdotes to the camera and his illusion that the character is smarter than he can express. His chemistry with his cronies and their constant Top 5 mutterings were great character development. 	As the movie unfolded I was reminded of Kevin Smiths Clerks where the characters in that film were as ironic and socially confused as these guys. Is this an attempt by Hollywood to do a Kevin Smith type movie? If so I can see why Smith is the king of these kinds of films. Another Smith element used here is the use of visible Hollywood alumni in basic cameo type roles. Cameos here were done by such stars as Catherine Zeta Jones, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Lili Taylor, Sara Gilbert, and of course Tim Robbins. Robbins role was one of the funniest in the film. That whole confrontation scene will be a crowd pleaser. Where the movie waned for me was characters obsession with not letting go of the past. Also why was their constant communication between Cusack and his ex? Did the end of the film really solidify the end of this characters quest for happiness? Was making a commitment enough? In some ways I found it to be a Hollywood way of arriving at a happy ending. I would have preferred him grow into an adult and then find a happy relationship. But instead it seems the woman sacrificed it all to take one step back to be with him. Well breaking up is hard to do. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer",High Fidelity

165,suvopyne49,I can watch it again and again and again ..,9,13 June 2011,"One can say it's not a classic or masterpiece, but honestly they will have a great time watching this movie. It's a musical romantic comedy, based on the book of same name, where the 'romantic' part of it takes the back seat. After breaking up with his girlfriend Laura(Iben Hjejle), Rob tries to measure his faults in his past break-ups, by listing his top-5 break- ups. The story goes as Rob tries to do the right thing to get himself sorted out with Laura. Meanwhile he also deals with all the problems of his Record-store,which he owns.Honestly, the best and most hilarious moments of the movie happens in Rob's music store, along with his two assistants( or in Rob's words 'Musical moron twins'). John Cusack is great to watch with his impeccable dialogue delivery. The musical moron twins, Barry and Dick, played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso, is an absolute treat to watch. As mentioned earlier, the liveliest parts of the movie involves this threesome of Rob, Barry and Dick. Frankly, Jack Black stole the show whenever he appeared on screen. 'Special mention' should be here for Tim Robbins for his cameo kind of a role.Finally, 'High Fidelity' is a movie which we can watch as many times as we desire. The characters and the moments stays with oneself, even after they finished watching it.",High Fidelity
166,eti55,A Comedy for Adults,10,12 February 2013,"John Cusack has made a career out of playing offbeat, off-center characters. High Fidelity could well be his finest hour. The movie centers on the trials and tribulations of the love life of Rob Gordon. Rob runs a used record store (as in, they sell vinyl), and he likes to put not just music, but various aspects of his life in the context of ""top 5"" lists.When the story starts, we see Laura, Rob's most recent girlfriend, leave him, prompting him to come up with, ""My desert island, all-time, top- five most memorable breakups, in chronological order, are as follows...(various names) Can you see your name on that list, Laura? Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten. But there's just no room for you in the top five, sorry! Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation and heartbreak you're just not capable of delivering."" Rob then proceeds to give a recap of his various misadventures in love, starting with his first breakup in grade school. He also talks extensively about the highs and lows of his relationship with Laura. Of course, we find out that Laura's departure has gotten to Rob a lot more than he initially admits. Rob talks to the camera throughout this movie, much in the same way he might talk to his therapist about his life, his loves, his friends and his hopes and dreams.In between flashbacks, we meet some of the quirky people in Rob's life, most notably Barry and Dick (played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), the two cultural rejects who work for him at the record store. Along with Rob, they like to fancy themselves as pop music aficionados and look down on the musically undiscriminating masses (Barry is especially annoying in this regard, even refusing to sell a record to a potential customer and treating him like garbage simply because, ""he offended me with his terrible taste!"").Cusack is great at playing characters who are borderline insane, and this movie is definitely no exception. One passage pretty much sums up this flick: After Charlie, #3 on his list (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) dumps him, Rob essentially goes nuts and rants on the street outside her window, ""Charlie! You f#%ing b!tch!! Let's work it out!!"" Then there's the scene where Rob fantasizes about pounding the stuffing out of the condescending and pretentious Ray (aka Ian), ""the other guy"" Laura's been seeing (played by Tim Robbins).High Fidelity is a terrific story about life and love with intelligent, clever, thoughtful dialog and memorable, quirky characters that draw you right in. It's far too innovative and non-formulaic to be classified as your basic rom com, but it's definitely a good one to see with a date.",High Fidelity

And superficiality worked on me in films.I knew plenty of blustery Jack Black types from college; But black was merely playing John Belushi, who certainly would have played the part back then. Yet the part seemed a mere plot device.There was little beyond the surface, no longer much I could relate to. A few laughs, some forced sensitivity. The relationship was ho-hum; I never cared whether it would work. As I walked out, I found High Fidelity to be instantly forgettable.

The film creatively and successfully weaves modern music into the story, showing how people relate to music in their lives and how particular pieces of music mark important places in time of our lives.

170,jayg_58,They're having more fun than we are.,5,17 November 2020,"I wanted to give this a really low score just to try and bring down the 7+ it has, but I went with honest. It's OK - period. It's one of those movies that the cast is having more fun than the audience, and I think all the cameos had their fan base review it. This is John Cusack, playing John Cusack and it's just tedious. But - as I said, lots of cameos who I guess contribute to the Oh Wow factor. Bruce Springsteen didn't even make it to set. Just a cut-a-way shot.
Cusack narrates and real-time walks his way thru various failed relationships with no explanation was to what his part in the failures was. Just that the women are all at fault and hence, must be some degree of psychotic. Right. Reminds me of a joke: If you change your Facebook status more than 3 times, it should read 'hard to get along with'. He plays a vanilla, non-descript but Cusack cute character with no major motivation in life who can't understand why women dump him (clue). There's no action, no mystery, no other plot development, and questionable dry humor. They had fun anyway. If you like slow, flat, plotless diatribe and NO chemistry between the main characters, then have at it.",High Fidelity
171,cottrellpj,Triumph for Cusack (and Hornby),10,1 April 2000,"John Cusack nailed it. He had the sense not to mess with the written word, the primordial text and the result is brilliant. Sure, it's in Chicago rather than London and I'll quibble a bit about the casting of skeletal Lisa Bonet as Marie, but ""High Fidelity"" is a pleasure from start to finish. The audience really enjoyed it on opening night, but it is a very literary movie, with a lot of words in it, so it took the crowd a little time to warm up. Of course, I knew all the words, because they were lifted verbatim from the novel.The balance between Cusack's soliloquies to the camera, the uproarious scenes in Championship Vinyl and the dramatic passages with Laura is handled well by director Frears (though it's hard not to see this as Cusack's picture from top to bottom). This is also a star vehicle for Jack Black, who chews the scenery very effectively. In true obsessive fashion, I may head back for a matinee this weekend to keep the buzz going. Anticipate several more soundtrack releases and strong ""word of mouth"" box office. If there's any justice (and there just might be) this will bring Nick Hornby's novel to a whole new audience. Maybe Cusack should be handed the reins to ""About a Boy"" as well (though Hugh Grant's lined up for that one, by all accounts).This is the ""intelligent"" date movie of all time. But as someone once said, men had better be careful...High Fidelity contains too many of your secrets!",High Fidelity
172,toclement,Nice music lover geekiness coupled with a lousy love story,6,5 January 2001,"Some movies you see, after you think about it a bit, you like it even more than when you left the cinema.  With others, the more you reflect upon it, the more you become cognizant of its flaws.  For me, High Fidelity' falls into the latter category.  Of course I was drawn in by the setting of the story: a guy around my age obsessively into music running a vinyl record shop in Chicago.  But below that somewhat romantic surface is a really tepid love story about two people who I had difficulty mustering any concern for.  The mind- boggling happy ending is unconvincing, to be polite, and intelligence insulting if I think about it more cynically.  Why is John Cusack, a nerdy record store guy in love with this dull yuppie?  And why is John Cusack, a nerdy record store guy so boring?  The film is full of interesting characters, all of whom are peripheral, but the principal players, John Cusack and Iben Hjeijle couldn't have been more regular, normal, and dull yuppies.  Perhaps that makes them quite realistic as most cool' people are indeed quite normal' under the surface (especially as they start pushing past 30).  Fine, but that doesn't mean I have to like a movie about people like this, does it? 
It's still probably worth seeing for the musical references (if you're into that) and for the exceptional supporting performances by Todd Louiso & Jack Black (playing Cusack's nerdy record store employees - they are infinitely more interesting than Cusack, both the actor and his character), Tim Robbins (who plays the annoying new age hippie guy to perfection), as well as John's sister Joan Cusack (who plays the hot-headed best friend of the female lead).  It's not a bad movie, but it just lacks much soul, especially regarding the main love story plot.  6 out of 10.",High Fidelity
173,HulkVader,Cusack is hilarious,9,19 September 2000,"I have liked Cusack ever since he started with the bit parts in the John Hughes coming-of-age films, like Weird Science.  Then he did the silly flicks like Better Off Dead and Sure Thing, which were amusing, as well.  He nearly always plays a likeable fellow, one of the guys you hung out with in high school.  And this is no exception.  This is a fresh, witty film about the joys and troubles of relationships.  We've all been there, and probably have more in store.  The way the film relates these relationship trials to the audience is it's most valuable attribute.  It's nice to know that I'm not the only one who's had relationship trouble!  Definitely worth the price of rental.",High Fidelity
174,mjhalta,Great love story with an entertaining musical backdrop,10,24 September 2007,"Some people have trouble understanding what this movie is really about, it is not about the music, it is about relationships. It is truly one of the great love stories of our time. There are some very important lessons that people could learn from it to improve their own relationships. The music is integral but not what this movie is about. The most important lesson to learn about having a good relationship is commitment! Watch it without interruptions and with someone you care about, and buy the CD as the music is great. As romantic comedies go this movie sets the bar very high indeed. It's not for people who never shut up even during a good movie. The dialog is intense and should be listened to with out someone talking in your ear.",High Fidelity
175,timelord-3,Not as good as I thought it was gonna be,8,29 August 2000,"""The movie ain't about geography"", or so I read in an interview with Nick Hornby recently, commenting about how the movie version of his book has been transposed from London to Chicago.  There were cries of ""it won't be the same!"", but High Fidelity does not suffer at all in the transition to the backwaters of this particular American city.High Fidelity is primarily about Rob (John Cusack), a music fanatic and record store owner who embarks on a spiritual journey to find out from his five former loves what exactly it is about him that precludes a long lasting and meaningful relationship.We are introduced to these former flames via the movies use of ""Top 5"" lists - in this case the ""Top 5 All Time Rejection List"".  The pursuit of the entries on this list forms the backbone of the movie, against which the characters interact.The other main players are the introverted and extroverted pair of fellow record store employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black).  Both are great foils for Rob, to me portraying the alternating sides of Rob's personality.  On the one side is his desire to be a a popular ladies man, and on the other side is his quiet nature, spending time cataloguing his record collection and making complilation tapes for friends.High Fidelity uses the technique of having the main character Rob talk directly to the audience.  This is not only used, it is used a *lot*.  If you don't like that sort of address straight to the audience, you will not like High Fidelity.  Most of the time it works, but after a while you just want him to shut the hell up.The soundtrack of course is a standout, trawling the 60s thru 80s for its gems.  Well worth a listen.I was a little disappointed with this movie.  It didn't seem to ""click"" as much as I thought it would and should have.  Cusack is probably a bit miscast; too much of the trademark Cusack pauses and pouty lips get in the way of good characterisation.  Having said that it was still good entertainment, although it was perhaps about 20 minutes too long.  The end part with the band CD premiere and the tacky ""store employee in supposedly crappy band turns out to be really good after all"" bits did break the flow and appeared tacked on.Good entertainment helped by a great soundtrack and solid support performances.7 out of 10.",High Fidelity
176,bill_b4,Good But Over-rated,7,1 October 2000,"Not a bad movie, but I'd hesitate to lump it into the pile of must-sees. Overblown movies like this (American Beauty was another one) make me reluctant to go see ""critically acclaimed"" movies while in the theater. To it's credit, I thought this movie rated higher than American Beauty, but what is up with John Cusack? He's done a row of artsy-fartsy (read ""overblown"" ""over-inflated"" or ""over-rated"") flicks lately like Grosse Pointe Blank, Being John Malkovich (another good but not the live-saving experience you'd expect from all the hype), Pushing Tin and the snooze-fest Cradle Will Rock. In other words, pause and send a point man in to see a John Cusack movie first. If he doesn't come out, call a coroner and go see another movie. Now I'm wondering if Almost Famous will be the exceptional movie critics claim it is, or just another puffed up , flavorless, rice crispy of a movie like High Fidelity.",High Fidelity
177,roark183,Worthless,1,10 January 2005,"This film simply consists of the ramblings of one Rob Gordon (characteristically played by John Cusack) who simply rambles on about his life.

Then the other half of his life is his record store where he has hired two people who are less responsible and intelligent than Gordon is, if that is possible.Jack Black very characteristically plays a real jerk that drives customers out of the record store, but Gordon complains that he can't fire his employees.If you enjoy films that have absolutely no plot and consist entirely of the ramblings of an irresponsible person complaining about his life, then this might just be the film for you.

Played out, or forced out might be better a description, on the screen, this is banal scripting, dull direction, less than ordinary camera work. Some nice performances, however. Cusack is not one of them. He seems to be in this for the paycheck. He mugs and has all of the emotional range of a chicken. Mugging is not acting. The girlfriend is good, unknown to me and convincing, given the banal script. The balding clerk does a wonderfully ditsy nerdy turn with just the perfect physical and verbal mannerisms that make you believe he is who he is playing. His familiar mate in the record store is good at what he does, which is broad and obvious and after a time annoying.

The last years he specializes himself in roles in which the character starts to doubt his lifestyle (the killer in Grosse Pointe Blank and the puppeteer in Being John Malkovich) and he seems to be born to play this character. (Like Bruce Willis is born to fight terrorists and other bad guys with a hang over and George Clooney disobeys his superiors' orders in every movie).The rest of the cast is also great, especially Jack Black who could be a cousin of Randall in Clerks (p*****g the customers off).High Fidelity has just what a movie needs. Terrific performances, perfect script and a soundtrack that is a part of the story (like in Forrest Gump and Boogie Nights).I'm gonna recommend this film to everyone I see and it's already my favorite film of the last year.The first thing I did after seeing this one was making a tape...10 out of 10.",High Fidelity

Everyone knows how much I love movies with LOVE and HEARTBREAK, but this sort of took me by surprise, and NOT really in a good way. I watched this film first when I was nine, when my dad took me to see it. I probably didn't understand a word and was confused why the main character is hurt so much by a girl.. // What I do remember pondering was how Jack Black was the BEST! and how much I felt bad for the character, Dick (Todd Louiso), who takes so much shyt from him. Viewing it now, as a film student and somewhat a critic, I think he is the best part of the movie. No Joke! We all have those people in our life that make us feel a little awkward and just ask too many god-damn questions. I think he changes the most throughout the film, too. In fact, our main protagonist, Rob (played by John Cusack), does not change at all. That is why I am not being too reviewer-friendly with this entry.The thing is: I am a realist (sort of). I like movies to speak to me; give me some answers to the things that I should already know that I have not fully grasped yet. That, and the fact that I want to relate with something. But this story let me down towards the end. - I swear, that rarely happens.****Seriously, though! It is a universal understanding that ""once a cheater, always a cheater"", and I do not take it lightly when someone ends up with the wrong person in the end. I wish it finished more truthfully; BETTER CLOSURE FOR THE BROKEN HEARTED. Not the old 90s ending where everything is okay, because it is not. Especially, for the viewer who, chances are, is alone and wonders why they cannot connect with anyone. I can go on forever, ranting about how I was let down in the climax of this film, but I do not want to bore you - and frankly, I do not want to write negatively about any project. **Maybe in ten more years, when I am a completely different person than I am now, I might enjoy the corniness, but as of right now - Too cliché (ONLY IN THE END, THOUGH).I rate this film a 6 out of 10. It honestly hurts me to do this, because I WANTED to like it. Really, I did! I WANTED it to be good, and a ahead of its time.

Watch it for the laughs, the most lovable characters of all and the most amazing soundtrack ever to be packed into 106minutes of romantic comedy cinema. Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a troubled record shop owner whose life takes a wrong turn when his long-term girlfriend leaves him. Forced to deal with his loss Rob lives his life as best as he can accompanied by his musical work buddies Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso). With the feel of rejection building up Rob makes a lousy attempt to forget his girlfriend and quickly build an obsessive need to rehash is past relationships in order to discover weather it was really his fault they all ended badly or just a mysterious turn of fate. With an unbeatable cast and without a doubt Cusack's finest performance to date, director Stephen Frears delivers Nick Hornby's best selling novel to the screen with a taste of the realistic complexity that is the modern relationship, unforgettable performances, comic relief and some pretty sweet tunes.",High Fidelity
187,Sneaky_Pete_XXVII,A movie that everyone can relate to,9,15 May 2003,"I'm pretty sure that anyone who has seen this film can relate to it in one way or another. I imagine that everyone has at some point worked with one or two goof-balls, has cheated on his/her partner, dumped over and over again, and feels that they have been s**t on their entire life. That's why I love this film. It is simple and it has class. The fact that John Cusack speaks to the audience makes the viewer relate to the character.    I enjoy the fact that John Cusack's character feels that he is always being s**t on, because then when he runs into a problem the problem seem more critical and more intense. A great example of this is when Rob (Cusack), discovers that his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is seeing Ian (Tim Robbins).     Another thing that I find very fascinating is the fact that Rob is very smart but in a aggressive and bold manner. Therefore his dialogue is made very impressive. High Fidelity has everything that a down-to-earth film should have and I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it. So, therefore they would enjoy it as well.",High Fidelity

When he rants on about his girl problems and reads his lists, I could listen to that all day. He makes it interesting. Jack Black also plays a very funny part. I think this movie got him noticed. Good romantic comedy movie. Different and a bit quirky but that's what's cool about it, and just about all of Cusack's movies.

On the other hand, it describes the complexity of love affairs and sentiments in modern and urban life, in particular, for people working in the artistic type of jobs. Owing to excellent script, all personalities are quite lively, and narrations by John Cusack are effective.  Very funny and makes you laugh a lot.  Because there are a lot of music we can enjoy through big screen Dolby sound system, and because we should not miss the funny words and sentences, we had better see this in the theater, not by video at home.  By the way, I recognize John Cusack is really handsome, because he is ""proof against"" many and long close-ups, which occupy considerable percentage of the film.

193,w2amarketing,Better Off Dead -- 15 Years Later,6,3 September 2005,"***Some cryptic spoilers possibly ahead*** In many ways, this is the sequel to BETTER OFF DEAD (1985). Rob / Lane is 15 years older, has a job, but still struggling with relationships. The movies are strikingly similar -- music plays a key role in both; Cusack's character is dumped at the beginning; he finds true love at the end (albeit in BOD with a different person); there's a hodgepodge of bizarre supporting characters that move in and out of the story with, in the end, Rob / Lane and his ""true love"" being the only ones that are anything close to ""normal."" There are differences, also, of course -- Rob speaks directly to the audience throughout, something Lane never does. For that reason, HF is a heavier film -- more drama, more ""black"" comedy, versus BOD with its lighter comedy bordering on slapstick at times, and dramatic elements which are present primarily in the background. Then there's the constant profanity, again perhaps inevitable, but an obvious difference.Even without making the comparison (unfortunately, for me every Cusack role ends up being inevitably compared to BOD), HF is still rather rough around the edges. Granted, it will have meaning to many, but I found myself halfway through being grateful that I got married young and don't have to worry about all this serial dating / relationship nonsense. Cusack is about my age, so I look at his roles as portraying people my age. I got married at 22 and have never regretted it; the idea of cohabitation with multiple partners without any sense of security of stability is therefore entirely foreign to me. Again, it probably means something to other people in my age group, but I'm personally glad I ""missed out"" on all that.My other criticism, alluded to earlier, is that this really isn't a comedy. I don't think I laughed once. On the DVD, I watched the trailer after seeing the movie and laughed out loud. The trailer is a thousand times funnier than the movie itself (and, in fact, contains several scenes that aren't in the final cut, while misrepresenting other scenes). The movie really isn't that funny -- some black comedy, some irony, some clever twists and dialog, but it's really a ""heavy"" film about struggling in relationships, work, friends, parents and overall identity for twenty- and thirty-somethings.",High Fidelity
194,Idolprincess,A good movie that I couldn't really enjoy,7,11 July 2004,"""High Fidelity"" is a movie that a lot of my friends liked and that had a high rating on most movie reviewing websites I've been to. It was also a comedy, and since I love comedies, I decided to rent it. I'm not sure if I can judge that movie properly for many reasons. First, I haven't read the book. Also, I'm not the age of the characters. I'm much younger and I haven't gone through high school in the early 80's like they have. And most of all, I don't know half of the music they talk about in the movie, which is one of the most important aspects to it. This movie is very realistic and even though the characters are much older than my surroundings, they reminded me of people I've known before. I suppose this is because it tried to portray the ""alternative"" crowd, I guess. A lot of people would find humor in the realism of the movie and of the main character. The way modern love is shown in this movie is also very realistic, maybe too realistic for my own tastes... This is my problem with this movie, I guess. It's not that I expect typical fluffy movie romance with roses all over the place, but.. This doesn't exactly match with my ideals.Like I said earlier, the main character is very realistic. Sometimes, that made me feel like I could relate to him. I also felt sympathy for him and laughed at times. But sometimes, this realism had the complete opposite effect on me. I don't know if anyone else felt this way, but I guess it's a good thing. It means it was well-made. There is a few very funny scenes involving the main character in my opinion, but the funniest part of the movie involves his co-workers. Jack Black is very funny.I think this is a great movie for many reasons. I can tell that some people are going to relate to the main characters and to his experience with women as well as his love for music. I know people are going to relate to the whole universe of ""high fidelity"". I just couldn't personally relate to it.",High Fidelity

Cusack is great as a disillusioned record store owner and I especially enjoyed Jack Black as the elitist uber-jerk of an employee. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is when Cusack and Black have a conversation about what it means if you say ""I haven't seen Evil Dead 2...yet.""

This analysis is going on on the back of a split up with Laura, who is No.5 in his all-time hardest break-ups list (I told you he was anal!).John Cusack and the whole cast are excellent, the characters well observed, the script full of laughs and emotion.

198,diffguy,A lot to say about dating,6,2 January 2020,"This director had a sexual awakening when he saw Say Anything and thusly developed a fetish for John Cusack being sad in the rain. Even made him get down in the dirt, like a straight male fantasy of women mud wrestling. Totally irrelevant comment I'm making right now, I know, but it was an odd amount of dramatic rain scenes for a single movie.This is an extremely realistic story about the insecurity of significant others, and the uncertainty of the future we have with others. How fearful we are of commitment, failure at our goals, being alone, and that jumping for one slightly better thing could cause us to lose what good thing we already have.I feel like this movie was niche relevant to the year 2000, and nothing beyond, which is manifestly fitting when you consider that every line of dialogue out of John Cusack's, or Jack Black's, mouth is about niche interests. The artists and albums and songs he references or jokes about are constantly obscure ones. I had to turn on subtitles just to know which artists etc he was saying because they were so unfamiliar. Like a foreign language. You could make the argument that this was purposeful, that Cusack's character was supposed to be elitist and therefore possessed a wealth of knowledge a layman wouldn't. However, I always felt like the viewer was supposed to be on his side for these jokes. These chastising remarks for customers who have bad taste for liking [Song/Band] was where I was should be laughing, in on the joke. It never happened.I felt like I, the viewer, should have envied Cusack. Should have thought of him as a cool guy for owning a record store, and having a catalog of hot past girlfriends. But really I just was annoyed with him. He does redeem himself by the end, sort of. The movie at least stayed true to its themes of realism, that even in our redemptive moments, we still retain traces of our destructive tendencies.",High Fidelity

Doesn't break any new ground with this one, though, and can't compete with Better Off Dead...",High Fidelity
200,Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday,There are more than 5 reasons to love this movie.,9,7 July 2007,"One only has to look at the movies section of the local paper (NOT during the winter Oscar months) to see the astonishingly high number of low-brow movies made specifically for 14-year-olds with Daddy's allowance. So seeing a comedy that is so fresh in its humor, so honest in its views on male romance, and so imperfect its lead protagonist, is about as rare as seeing Halley's comet. It's a moment to savor, for you know it'll be a generation before another like it comes along.Rob (John Cusack), a thirty-something who owns a record store that ""attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers,"" has just been dumped (yet again) by his current flame Laura (Iben Hjejle) because he hasn't changed or grown up. This sends our immature hero on a journey of self-discovery as to why he can't seem to sustain a relationship, which includes visiting (and re-visiting) all the other girls on his Top 5 list, including (in chronological order) Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick, Charlie Nicholson (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Sara Kendrew (Lili Taylor). All the while, he tries fruitlessly to win back Laura and to grasp why she prefers the company of hippie ex-neighbor Ian ""Ray"" Raymond (Tim Robbins), in addition to having long talks about music with his two employees, Barry (Jack Black)--imagine a human version of Cartman from ""South Park"" but with an impeccable taste in music--and quiet Dick (Tod Louiso). Through his journey towards self-discovery, Rob slowly grows up and realizes what relationships are all about.Rob on page comes off as a self-pitying, adolescent jerk, a challenge for a character-driven comedy/drama. The casting of John Cusack immediately helps the problem, because 1. Cusack is becoming the most automatically charming and lovable star since Cary Grant and 2. as a co-writer of the script, he knows Rob inside, out and backwards. This role is his. And because slowly, we see a boy becoming a man, a common theme of Nick Hornby's books. First Rob wants Laura back simply because his pride is hurt by being dumped, but as time goes by we see that he did truly have affection and love for her, which results in Rob making a list of ""Top 5 Things I miss about Luara."" There isn't a moment we don't root for him, even when we question his maturity.The supporting characters provide the movie with a great deal of needed laughs to help ease the at times brutal honesty. Jack Black is a scene-stealer as music snob Barry, a guy so self-righteous he doesn't even give service to a customer who wants to buy ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" because it insults his own taste. He's the kind of guy that you would violently assault in reality...if you weren't laughing so hard your stomach feels sore. Had the movie not been saddled with an actor as strong as Cusack, Black would've stolen the show. Tod Louiso is also great as Tod, as quiet as Barry is loud. Tim Robbins must've had so much fun playing the rebound man with a ponytail who inadvertently makes Rob's life a living hell. Joan Cusack, as usual, brings larger-than-life energy to her role as Laura's friend Liz. The only weak link is Iben Hjejle. But it isn't entirely her fault; the movie spends so much time focusing on Rob's dilemma when it should've spent a little time explaining what made Rob fall in love with her in the first place. And against such a great supporting cast, anyone would pale in comparison to Mr. Black.This movie is, quite simply, the ultimate male chick flick (a dick flick?), one that men can learn from while the women drool over Cusack and both can laugh at the numerous funny and truthful incidents (who HASN'T imagined killing the new flame of an ex?). A great movie if you've been married for 30 years or, more especially, if your relationship can't last longer than a tic-tac. An essential John Cusack role, whose exclusion at awards time is further proof that the 2000 Oscars were a joke. Not since ""Say Anything"" was Cusack more romantic or lovable. Never again will be more self-confessional. Movies like this don't come out every Friday. What are you waiting for?",High Fidelity
201,croweykid,Excellently written antihero; not sympathetic but very accurate,6,3 November 2021,"I couldn't stomach more than the first 10 minutes of this movie the first 2 or 3 times I tried to watch it. Cusack's character was so unlikeable that I couldn't imagine rooting for him at all, and yet I was fairly sure he was supposed to be a sympathetic & relatable character.But I'm a little older now, with a better developed sense of irony and see that he isn't necessarily supposed to be any sort of ""hero"" or role model. Very much an antihero. An occasionally sympathetic loser with attitude problems and a hopeless degree of cluelessness. He's so average and Everyman that he depressed me, because he's basically every ""small"" reason you break up with a guy, incarnate.But in retrospect, I see that this is truly masterful writing. The writer really crafted this loser perfectly. Unfortunately, I think a lot of guys will see this film and relate and the only takeaway will be that ""sometimes loser guys get lucky"" rather than comprehension that he grew a little and changed as the story progressed. Very little. Vanishingly small character growth, but it was there, and it was some of the most realistic & believable character growth ever depicted in film. Because it was so slight. He didn't turn into someone else by the end of the story, to win the day. Those kinds of big ""baby I've really changed"" spiritual revolutions never really stick. Our synapses are calcified in the same bad shapes until he gradually tai chi them into subtly different channels like rivers transforming a canyon.To the extent that the ending was satisfying, it was, at very least, believably so. Which is rare in most movies and grim in the remaining few. This was neither fictitious nor grim.I was afraid this was really one of those ""bro"" movies for ""bros"" about how women are the problem, that desire is a weakness synonymous with hate, a stealing of masculine power that must be thwarted or punished. There was a rash of them in this cinematic era, with the Van Wilder franchise and similar rubbish. All them remind me of that ""just grab em by the p*ssy"" pickup artist attitude in frat culture which quickly turns to broflake, incel, men's rights tantrums when it fails to pan out the way they'd hoped.Cusack characters tends to have toddler meltdowns in his movies which ring more whiny than absurdly endearing like, for instance, a Nicholas Cage meltdown. Rob says the quiet parts out loud. Has no self control. Neatly always feels sorry for himself. He lacks empathy but is *incredibly* sensitive to his own delicate needs - like groundless masculine pride. He's almost never as brave as he wants to be, and often that's a good thing. It's fine. The movie is aware of this (and punishes him for it). Yet, he really represents the flaws that nearly all men grapple with in one way or another, to varying degrees of success.On another note, the record shop boys were perfectly written and almost perfectly played. Jack Black was actually impeccable. I've known these characters in real life, and that made these people immensely satisfying to watch, even though they were periodically excruciating. Such an accurate representation of hipster elitist music culture & its diva indie scholars living in cardboard boxes made of vinyl covers.The love interests were all quite excellent and tragically but often hilariously sympathetic. You feel sorry for them at times and are really happy for them, mostly. Seeing Joan Cusack onscreen is always a treat.I gave it 6 because in the end, I really still didn't like Rob much, but if I were to rate this on something actual ""objective"" quality over pure personal enjoyment, it's an easy 8. I'm glad I finally watched it & do see what all the fuss is about and why it means so much to so many friends (most of them male hipster music snobs).Cons:

205,Benjy,Hornby travels the Atlantic well.,9,5 August 2000,"Having seen Fever Pitch I never thought anything written by Nick Hornby would be made as an American film - not made well anyway! However, when the same team that wrote, directed, produced, etc... Grosse Pointe Blank signs a deal to turn Hornby's book about infidelity in a record store you know it's in some of the safest hands it could be. I say that but this film represents John Cusacks Production team's proof that Grosse Pointe Blank was not a fluke. High Fidelity is an excellent film. Well scripted, excellently acted, particularly by the supporting cast and well directed. Actors talking to the camera can sometimes seem uncomfortable but John Cusack carries it off in a style that feels natural to watch. The same though cannot be said of Iben Hjejle (Laura), she is acting in a foreign language but sadly for large portions of the film this makes her appear wooden. This is only seriously noticeable in a couple of scenes but with so many good actresses around I can't fathom how she got the part. She certainly is no Minnie Driver. Catherine Zeta-Jones also seems an odd choice for one of Cusack's former loves. She plays the part well enough but there's something not quite right, she's just miscast I feel. It's hardly a laugh a minute but it's a darn sight better romantic comedy than the average Hugh Grant flick. It is though, in the record store that the film comes to life where Jack Black and Todd Luiso play Cusack's long time muso employees. To call Black a scene stealer is like calling the Saturn V Moon Rocket a firework. All that a great slimy cameo by a ponytailed Tim Robbins. Watch this movie, even if you're not on a date. If John Cusack hadn't done Pushing Tin I'd have though he could do no wrong, 2 of the best movies of the past 12 months have his name above them.

209,Sailor-21,Thoroughly satisfying,9,23 April 2000,"As I browsed through the comment posted on IMDb about this movie, it occurred to me that many of the people commenting are quite as fierce in their views about movies as the record store guys are about records.First off, as I was born before WWII got under way, the musical references throughout the movie meant absolutely nothing to me.  That's a statement of fact, not a criticism.  I was able to just enjoy the movie, without having to bother my head about the technical musical stuff.The movie certainly passed my threshold test of any movie - whether it induces suspension of disbelief.  The characters were thoroughly credible, and the story line held my attention all the way.The characters were all beautifully drawn and likeable.  I found the Charlie character interesting.  She's more stunning than anybody has a right to be. Us guys just have no defences against anybody that gorgeous.  We just want to throw ourselves at her feet.  So it was very satisfying to see that she's just a gorgeous but shallow facade after all.  Serves her right!  I also liked the subtly steely undertone in the Laura character.The Barry character was masterfully drawn.  Mr. Relentlessly Knowledgeable himself!I thought that the looking-into-the-camera bits were done just right.  I gave a little groan when this first happened in the movie, because those bits don't usually go down right for me.  Even a voice-over narration such as Spacey's in American Beauty (a much-overrated movie, by the way) doesn't usually work for me.  But here I found those bits just right, fitting in well with the overall consciously self-conscious nature of the record store gang.  And what a nice thing to say about anybody, as Rob did, that the second best thing he liked about Laura was that she had character, because when she was having a bad day she didn't take it out on the people around her!  If somebody were to say that about me, I'd marry her on the spot!If I have one criticism of the movie, it's that it drags just a tad towards the end.  The bits after the funeral of Laura's father weren't really necessary.  They added nothing to the story or the characters, except for the surprise about Barrie's stage presence - and I'm not sure I find that aspect of Barrie's character plausible.  (Can you be a relentlessly knowledgeable self-centered vinyl geek and also a performer who has the gift of sharing himself with an audience?  I think not.)  I think the pacing of the movie would have been better if Rob's realisation that he loved Laura had followed smartly after the affectionate sex-in-the-Saab scene.All in all, a thoroughly satisfying movie - nicely scripted and nicely played.BTW, I think it's grand that IMDb has a spell checker for these postings.  I get thoroughly annoyed every time I read mis-spelled rants on the web, and Lord knows there are enough of those.  If we're going to rant, let's at least rant literately!And hey - even a new window for the list of mis-spellings, so that we can easily flip back and forth between our mis-spellings and our text.  I'm impressed!",High Fidelity

I should have known what I was getting into at this point.Rob (John Cusack) proceeds through the moviegoing to work at a record store he owns. He doesn't have the balls to fire the people he hired. Jack Black is excessively rude; he criticizes everyone and everything. He plays the role well, but the character is so obnoxious, I felt like I wanted to bitch slap him in every scene.Dick is a decent character, although he is a weenie. He attempts to counteract the over obnoxiousness of Jack Black's character. At least in the parts I saw saw him in, he seemed like  baggage rather than character with something to contribute.John Cusack plays a perfect generation x recrod store owner.

This changed later on. For some kind of reason I think John Cusack is terribly funny. After I found this out, I decided that I should see High Fidelity, since I had heard a lot about it. And I really liked it! Apparently it's a guy movie, but I still like it. Rob Gordon is really, well, a huge loser - but that only makes it more fun to watch. The story really has no point what so ever, but who cares!John Cusack plays a very Cusack-like part as a thirty-something record-store-owner (which is a nice excuse to use all kinds of music that nobody really listens to anymore (walking on sunshine? Come on!)) with fear of commitment. Things get worse when his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle or something like that) decides to leave him for Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins, with the most awful-looking hairstyle in the history of his films). Rob then tries to find out what  he has done wrong to deserve all of the other girls leaving him. He seeks help with his ex-girlfriends (including Lily Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones) to find out what he has done wrong.And of course, there's always Jack Black as Barry, the hard-boiled shop assistant who has made a living of insulting people. Being a very funny element in this film, it basically set of his further career (remember Shallow Hal?).I could give you many other reasons which would oblige you to see this film, but I'm running out of time.

It was about two hours long, but by the last half hour I was praying for the end.I was expecting something funnier.  There were some really funny moments, but overall I would never call the film a comedy. Jack Black absolutely stole the show, and I truly believe that the movie would have been a complete disaster without him.The lead female role is annoying.  I spent the entire two hours wondering what she had been in before and why the hell she cut her bangs so short. (She's from Denmark, and hasn't been in anything I've ever seen.  I still don't know about the bangs.)There were a lot of references to obscure bands, which bothered me because I felt like I was missing the joke a lot of the time.I found myself laughing at things that were only slightly funny.

Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or was I miserable because I listened to pop music."" From the opening words, High Fidelity will make you laugh and fall in love with it. John Cusack's best movie to date. While watching the movie, you'd never know that he wrote some of the screenplay and was a music supervisor for the movie- two very big accomplishments since the movie is so great for its sharp and endearing comedic aspects and the music that lies beneath them. With artists ranging from The Chemical Brothers to The Vaselines, High Fedelity easily has one of the year's, and perhaps the century's, greatest soundtracks. The music knowledge displayed by both the people who pick the songs and the characters who exhibit them will make you feel so musically inadequate that you want to go out and by every record mentioned (even the Peter Frampton).Besides it hilarious and precise writing, courtesy of Nick Hornby, High Fidelity offers a look into the inner workings of the male mind-- with everything from crappy-yet-not-crappy jobs, life-styles, list-making habits, and self-destructive love lives. Rob's love life provides the heart of the movie (letting old loves die and growing up), while his job provides his hilarity (with Barry, portrayed by Jack Black, and Dick), and his list-making seamlessly ties the whole thing together. All together, the movie is nearly flawless, musically brilliant, and a work of art.

Having heard two quotes on this movie the same week, I decided to rent it. Apart from these reasons, this movie also happens to star an actor whose work I have gotten interested since watching ""Been John Malkovich"", John Cusack.But this is not a musical movie; this is a romantic comedy which just happens to feature a main character who owns a record store, the store opposing poles clerks and the independent artist Marie de la Salle.I'm not going to put myself as a victim, but life has treated me so bad, I'm unable to fully enjoy a romantic film. Whether its Titanic, The Notebook or As Good as it Gets, it just doesn't make me feel right to watch one of these movies all alone. So unless you have a partner with whom to watch it or are not as tragic as me when it comes to loneliness, you might just enjoy this movie.That is exactly why, I can't say I fully enjoyed this film, but I'll still rated with 7/10; plus the musical environment does help, so if you and your partner have a musical background, the movie will become exponentially better.",High Fidelity

224,glassorange,Anyone who doesn't love this film needs to be analyzed.,10,30 January 2002,"I have read some horribly scathing reviews of ""High Fidelity""  recently. One person even called it the worst film they ever saw and preferred the plague and ritual suicide to viewing it.  Either this person is deluded or they're missing the point entirely (or both).  This is a film about people. Real people.  It's a hilarious, thoughtful masterwork of cinema.  ""High Fidelity"" is on my list of the ten best films ever made. A lot of people criticized it for having a ""standard"" John Cusack performance.  I personally don't see anything wrong with that, even though I don't quite agree with it.  If you see it as routine from Cusack, you should still respect the performance because it's still a good character.  Woody Allen has been playing the same character ever since Alan Felix in ""Play it again, Sam,"" but that doesn't make his films any less remarkable.  So I say leave Cusack alone.  He's one of the best American actors of modern times. Stop whining about his characters and go watch ""Top Gun"" or something. ""High Fidelity"" is a brilliant piece of cinema and if you don't get it, then you don't understand real cinema.  There IS romance, but these characters are casual about their romantic existence, that's what makes them real. There is comedy, but it's intelligent, so it goes beyond those who understand only toilet humor.  There is drama and these actors with a touch of humanity that is equalled by few films.  Those who don't appreciate ""High Fidelity"" for everything it is need their heads examined.",High Fidelity
225,vince4953529,Depictions about life and relationships,7,1 February 2010,"This film is about how complicated and unpredictable relationships could be. I can relate to many scenes in this movies: the arguments, being accused of not willing to grow up, the endless phone calls, the late tears at night, the breaking-ups and the going-backs...The film also music-heavy. I've listened to lots of bands to my life so I know most of the music they were discussing in there. Setting in Chicago, I've been to most of the locations shot in the movie. It reminds me a lot of the movie ""Reality Bites"". About relationships, music, friends... that most people can relate to.I also found many characters to be memorable. Iben Hjejle also gorgeous in the film, also an unexpected appearance by Tim Robbins. Jack Black is explosively hilarious, bursting out lines and lines of comedic gold.",High Fidelity
226,kejava,A well-thought-out movie about being single and 30-something,9,16 April 2000,"Ever since The Sure Thing, I've been a John Cusack fan.  High Fidelity tells the tale of a 30-something man who hasn't found his direction in life, someone who has drifted from relationship to relationship while ignoring the things and people that made him the happiest.  His self revelation is not overly surprising, but was to me tremendously satisfying.  The conflicting urges we all feel to see what is around the next bend, while simultaneously hang back and not commiting to the present and its potentials, are a large part of what makes us human.  This portrayal of his struggle to figure out where his failures have been (or, more precisely, why he has viewed certain events as failures), is enlightening and well-acted.  An excellent film.",High Fidelity
227,taproot,"""Call me shallow"" but it's still a romp.",7,1 April 2000,"John Cusack is one of my better choices to watch in a film; it must be his Irish genetic string, or perhaps it's simply because he is one hell of an actor.  I'm old enough not to recognize many of the songs played throughout this film, but not old enough not to still appreciate people with a passion for music. Cusack owns a record shop, accompanied by his zany (great characters) part-timer helpers. But Cusack is more interested in why his girl friends are, and have been leaving him. And we get a glimpse of his top 5 more painful separations.  There is quite a plethora of beautiful women and much narration in this film, but John Cusack does it so well, that the narration becomes comfortable.  Tim Robbins plays a minor role and performs quite well.  It's a film that is enjoyable, not heavy, and if you're in a good mood to see fluff, but fluff done as well as fluff can be done, you may enjoy this film too.",High Fidelity
228,-88,No conflict,4,11 December 2000,"It's a cop-out, and it has no dramatic structure.  John Cusack plays Rob, the unappealing protagonist who owns a record store and loses his girlfriend to his own apathy and fear of commitment;  he maybe is too believable in the role, and I ended up resenting him almost as much as his girlfriend must have.  By the time the ending rolled around, I was left with no one to root for, and no conflict to resolve except the non-dramatic one in Rob's head. (The film, incidentally, starts over about three quarters of the way through, stranding the viewer in Rob's neuroses -- how much fun is that?) There are a lot of likeable moments, especially when Joan Cusack is on-screen, but there's nothing to hold you, unless you identify with the protagonist -- which a lot of guys must.  It's also dismaying to hear the screenwriters name-checking bands from Serge Gainsbourg to Stiff Little Fingers.  It goes far beyond demonstrating the characters' erudition.  It's there to divide the audience into the hip and unhip:  ""street cred."" 4/10",High Fidelity
229,Normy18,Should've brought my gun...I mean this should be fun!,6,7 July 2000,"If Only.Cusack is one of my favorite actors and he again struts his stuff in High Fidelity.  His talent for developing a believable character is extraordinary; sometimes I think his characters reflect parts of him.  Then again, parts of his character in High Fidelity could reflect on a lot of people.Anyway, the character development in High Fidelity is fantastic, the dialogue is realistic and often funny, and the writing is unique and fresh.But...the whole movie felt like some really bad sex.  Foreplay for an hour and a half, and just when you think there might be a satisfying climax, it doesn't really come, and you leave smoking a bad cigarette. 
I don't like being teased with a plot that doesn't really grow.  Either make a movie with a plot or make a movie without one.  I know this movie and the characters are more or less realistic, but that doesn't mean I find the general public very interesting, and would want to continue viewing these anecdotes.  Besides, one can only digest so many ""Top 5"" lists from someone who's terribly difficult to care about.  Without a plot, I wouldn't have tried to care about him, and would've enjoyed his character more.I think the director tried to hit every base in the world with this movie. For many, it does.  For me, Frears tripped over second base gawking at his own talent.",High Fidelity
230,RachelG-2,Not that great,5,24 April 2000,"I saw this movie last weekend, pulled in by the trailers.  Unfortunately, the trailers showed the best parts of the movie.  I normally like John Cusack as an actor, but this movie was a real turn-off.  Took forever to get started, to the point that I almost dozed off in the beginning, and I cared very little about any of the characters.  Why was Rob so hung up on Laura when she was such a yutz?  The only character I liked at all was the Michael Stipe lookalike, that was all.  I wondered if I would have liked this film more if I were older and remembered all the music.  I just thought this film was really dull and the characters were not people I would ever want to know.Not recommended.",High Fidelity
231,arthurpewty,For fans of the book and GROSSE POINTE BLANK,10,26 March 2000,"John Cusack, as our lead character the record shop owner Rob, talks to the camera, narrating his own story, in between the bits where it unfolds on its own. The genius of this is that it allows the prose from Nick Hornby's extremely enjoyable book to remain, without voice-over, which would seem inappropriate for this story. And therefore the only real fault of the movie is there is not as much book in the movie as there is in the book.Some of the REALLY GOOD bits from the book that stick in memory are unfortunately missing, but there is plenty good left. Cusack is quintessential Cusack, Jack Black takes the abusive record clerk Barry to bigger heights than any reader could have dreamed, and Iben Hjejle - the only wonderful thing in the formulaic MIFUNE - is again wonderful as Rob's on- and-off girlfriend Laura. One of the additions not in the book, a scene where Laura's new guy Ian (Tim Robbins) comes into Rob's record shop and he envisions revenge is a hilarious showstopper.",High Fidelity
232,minavagante,"good, but only if you already read the book",7,8 July 2000,"High Fidelity was out in Italy yesterday, July the 7th, and I was in at the first showing. The first question to arise is ""who turned the book into this script?"": it's true the book is a sort of monologue, but turning it into 90 minutes of ""speaking into the camera"" was the easiest, although worst, way to do the job; anyway, John Cusack adopts a theatrical way of acting and manages to keep your attention up. But the good points of the book are almost all missed, first of all the theories on how to make a cassette, then the anger against Ian, or Charlie's Marco...In a nutshell, this movie adds very little to the book, and what is added is not worth the effort of adding: why is the singer played by Lisa Bonet? Why is the story set in Chicago, when all the inside locations (Rob's house, Charlie's house) look absolutely British? What's the use of having Bruce Springsteen appear like Humphrey Bogart in Woody Allen's ""Play it again Sam""? (not to mention that the Italian dubbing killed the song Bruce is playing in his scene!!!!)Still, most of the actors do a great job, especially Cusack, the guys in the record shop and Tom Robbins (wonderfully disgusting!).See it only if you read the book already, it would be like meeting old friends you haven't seen in a while; otherwise, read the book first.",High Fidelity
233,naun,Top Five differences between the book and the film,7,9 February 2001,"Some semi-spoilers below.Top Five differences between the book and the film:1. Thanks to Iben Hjejle's wonderful performance, Laura emerges as a real, independent person more strongly than she does in the book, where we tend to see her only through the prism of Rob's self-absorbed personality. The film also builds up our perception of what Laura means to Rob by giving us Rob's Top Five Things I Miss about Laura, which I don't remember being in the book. The film does add something here.2. The film ends with Rob and Laura implicitly but clearly on the way to middle-class, middle-aged prosperity and contentment. Rob starts his own record company, Laura enjoys her career success. The book is more equivocal. In the book, Laura resents having to work in the corporate world, and Rob just ends up sticking with what he knows. The film ends up affirming the American Way; the book gives its characters smaller joys in the bleakness of post-Thatcher Britain. The film's relatively upbeat ending isn't overdone, but I prefer the book.3. In the film, things take their natural course in the car scene. In the book, Rob finds an excuse to desist, as a way of hurting Laura. In a way, the book is more complex and interesting at this point, but it's probably one twist too many and, anyway, it assumes a degree of self-control on Rob's part that he doesn't show any sign of anywhere else in the story. I give this one to the film.4. In the film, Dick meets his girlfriend by discovering mutual musical interests in the record shop. Those of us who have spent half our lives hanging around used record shops know that those places aren't exactly the Love Boat; the only people you ever meet are sad, solitary, dissolute males like yourself. The book has Dick meeting his girlfriend somewhere outside of hours, and then progressively trying to indoctrinate her with his favourite music. This is a lot more true to life.5. Ian/Ray is a somewhat distant, shadowy figure in the book. Tim Robbins brings him to life brilliantly in the film. Rob imagines a much more physical comeuppance for him in the film than he gets in the book, and this works very well on the big screen. This is a good example of the film staying very true to the spirit of the book even when some of the details differ.All in all, the film is very enjoyable and if you read the book you'll see how skilfully the film has been adapted from it. But inevitably the book has more time to dwell on Rob's thoughts, and since it's Rob's internal mid-life crisis that the story is all about, I think the book does have more to offer. It's a pity also that the film didn't make better use of the soundtrack to reflect the characters' emotional lives, which after all is the whole idea of the story. Still, this is a great film to sit down with in front of the video player with that pizza and that beer and those kettle chips.",High Fidelity
234,Skeptic-8,"High-voltage, enjoyable, well-acted and thought-provoking",9,3 April 2000,"High Fidelity is a wonderful book, and I feared for its transition to the screen.  But I need not have worried - this film is a brilliant translation of something that is usually  portrayed well only in novels, i.e., the internal dialog between our better and worse selves in a time of crisis.  To make a film protagonist's inner life manifest, the filmmakers have used a technique that often screams ""contrivance,"" but in this film, works well: the protagonist's direct speeches to the camera.  They genuinely carried me into protagonist Rob's thought processes, self-deceptions, soft spots, and, ultimately, enlightenment.  The music is terrific, and the fast pace of the film was jazzy and fun. Likewise, acting, editing, and dialog all sparkled.  My only complaint was that John Cusack looked so scruffy that his physical desirability was somewhat questionable; couldn't they have scrubbed him up just a bit?",High Fidelity
235,Patuquitos,Now this is what I would call a musical,9,9 October 2005,"It was about time someone put together a film with a genuine appreciation for the love/music connection that didn't end up being something along the lines of ""Singles"". For music lovers who tend to put a soundtrack to everything they experience, this film is a blessing. I am one of those people, so I understand that if you're not, you'll get less from the movie. All I'm trying to say is that this is one of those films that demand you to root for the characters and the events if you want to enjoy it. The deeper the affection you feel for them, the more you'll enjoy the movie.Personally, I think John Cusack's character is one of the most engaging in the comedy genre of the last decade. This is the kind of character I like: simple and complex at the same time, just like in real life. Somebody likable but annoying at times. Again, I feel a deep personal connection with him, and I understand him every time, even when he acts stupid.But he is not alone. The rest of the cast is terrific.Anyway, don't forget this is a comedy. You will laugh your ass off with some situations and dialogue. Hilarity comes from many different sources: you've got black humor, silly humor, complex (people would say ""intelligent"", but I despise the term) humor... Special mention goes to Tim Robbins paying a visit to the record store. Genius.On a very personal level, I think there's a magnificent scene that sums up the heart and the brains of this movie. John Cusack talks to the camera (something that happens often) instructing the audience on how to make a perfect music compilation for your loved one. If you like that concept, the movie will grab you and won't let you go. If that idea doesn't sound seductive to you, you might just have a good time.

The slacker scenes in the record store (esp. the fantasy sequences)are hilarious and the cameos are excellent. Stepping back into the older ""Say Anything/Better Off Dead"" mode was a smart move by Cusack who combines comedic pathos with manic energy. However the half hour or so that John spends talking to the camera is way overkill and no one in the packed theater I went to was amused by any of it.

241,easmax,Pretty grim stuff for a comedy,5,18 March 2005,I rented this because of the several good reviews it has. I also wanted to see a comedy.The first half of the movie was rather funny but was due to the role that Jack Black has and his acting.Somewhere around the middle of this overrated film whatever comedy there was was overshadowing by a series of the rejections that the Cusack character was getting. If you find rejection funny then rent the movie. But I found it quite un-funny.The idea of the movie was unique and maybe the book was better than the movie.And casting was good but over all I fail to see why this movie was given more than 5 stars.The best thing about the movie was the actor Jack Black,High Fidelity
242,starzinhereyes7,A film experience only enhanced by reading the book first,8,10 August 2010,"This is a great movie, but I recommend reading the book first. The filmmakers adapted it with a sense of creativity and respect for the original text, and the casting could not be more perfect. John Cusack is immensely appealing even at his most hapless, and every moment Jack Black is on screen is hilarious. Part of the fun of both the book is getting inside Rob's head and hearing his thoughts, which gave me a delightful mix of amusement that someone could be so clueless and relief that I'm not the only one who feels the way he does. The book deftly works the first-person narration of the novel by having Rob address the camera, ala Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, but naturally some of Rob's sharp observations had to be cut. Since I watched the movie the same day I finished the book, the words were fresh in my memory, so I felt like I knew what he was thinking even when he it would have disturbed the flow of the movie to have him actually say it Unless you're the type who can't enjoy a film adaptation if it veers even an inch from the book, read the book first. It has even more insights into the pain of relationships, and is darker and more cynical than this charming film.

Generally the movie is full of sense of humor using music and songs, I feel kind of embarrassed as I, myself don't have enough knowledge of music in understand the deeper emotion the writer was trying to express.However, High Fidelity reminds me of what I always believe in, which is, music does not only represent itself. Good music is like good characters in a script, they do not make sense without the story plot. We all have our own music history in our life, which every songs do flash back and also represent certain memory which we only had and only felt at that exact moment, that moment we were listening to that particular song. And I guess that's why Rob, (and most of us,) organizes his albums based on the order of memories that related to them.",High Fidelity
246,Heavenly Creature,Plenty to enjoy here,7,20 May 2001,"Welcome to the world of men.  Please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times. Based on Nick Hornby's best-selling, and rather charming book, this film remains extremely faithful to it, charting the disastrous love life of Rob Gordon, a typical bloke doing typical bloke things.  You know, like cheating on his girlfriend, spending the majority of his time with his loser mates and compiling countless top 5 lists on every subject under the sun.  The setting has been moved from London to Chicago, but as Nick Horny himself explained, this film is not concerned with geography.  What it is concerned with is trying to justify why men act the way they do.  And while it doesn't always succeed, it's an entertaining little ride along the way.John Cusak is brilliant as Rob.  Having read the book myself, I can't think of anyone else who could play this part better.  It would have been all too easy to cast a better-looking, better-known actor in this role, but had that been the case, I probably wouldn't be writing such a favourable review about the film.  Cusak is engaging, playing the part with humour and vitality. And while the character of Rob may not always be likeable, he is certainly always entertaining.The supporting cast is nearly always strong, with some shameless scene-stealing from Jack Black as Barry, one of Rob's friends who works in the record shop with him.  But while all Rob's former girlfriends play their parts well (Catherine Zeta Jones a particular standout as the pretentious Charlie), the actress playing his latest break-up, and the cause for most of his anguish, is slightly static and poorly judged.  It didn't come as a surprise to me to find out this was her first film role.But apart from this little glitch, High Fidelity is almost faultless.  A good soundtrack, some extremely funny sequences (Barry playing light-hearted music while Rob seethes, having just broke up with his girlfriend) and excellent acting from almost everyone involved makes this an extremely enjoyable flick.  Men will relate to it, and women will enjoy finding out what makes men act this way whenever Rob does something a bit stupid.  This is the male equivalent of Bridget Jone's Diary, and it's probably just as funny.",High Fidelity
247,dylan-grieve,Where do I start?,9,30 May 2011,"Maybe I should just make a bullet list of all the reasons why this is a great film, but will attempt to do it in paragraph form. John Cusack plays a somewhat neurotic mid-thirties record store owner. He is almost past his prime, and having just been left by his girlfriend, begins to panic, inspiring a sort of cathartic, self-absorbed, grandiose pondering of the opposite sex, and begins framing his life by what he perceives as his failures with women.This movie is amazing in terms of dialogue; so good I could probably listen to it as an audio file. If you are a fan of movies such as Chasing Amy or Alfie, then you will likely appreciate the way this film explores the desires and insecurities of the male psyche. This movie seemed geared somewhat more towards a male audience, but never felt chauvinistic. John Cusack's acting had me feeling extremely empathetic, even as I laughed at the sheer pathetic nature of his plights.Overall, the movie felt very human, and very real. His speech at the end carried a wholesome message, and seemed like one of the best things any guy could say to a girl to set her mind at ease. So ladies, check this film out.",High Fidelity

252,cericsso,"A real study of male behavior, in high fidelity",10,4 January 2008,"It needs to be said right from the start; ""High Fidelity"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, period. Based on British author Nick Hornby's novel, and adapted into an American surrounding, co-produced and starring, among others, John Cusack, this is The Movie of heartbreak, sorrow, break-up, love, sex and most of all, music. And it's all told from a male perspective.Cusack stars as Rob Gordon, a juvenile thirty-something guy working at a record store with his two equally-minded friends. Rob is a music enthusiast with a collection of (what can only seem like) hundreds of labels, which he meticulously re-arranges in different orders at various times of his life. The story kicks off when Laura, Rob's long-time girlfriend, decides she's had enough, and leaves Rob, moving out of their mutual apartment. This thrusts Rob into not only an endless pit of sorrow and self-deprivation, but also a quest to find out what it is that has always made him such a lousy boyfriend. To do so, he goes through what he calls the ""Top Five Break-Up""-list of previous relationships, trying to contact them again hoping to gain some more knowledge about himself, with varying results. To top it all off, it very quickly seems as if there is a ""certain other"" involved in his ex-girlfriend's life. This all, while working with two guys who are of no help whatsoever. In other words, it seems like a nightmare..What, for me at least, made ""High Fidelity"" so enormously superb is, that you just really connect to it. Not just as a great story, but from your own experience. It's funny to the point where you laugh out loud (which happens a lot) and you just sympathize with the characters and the misery, grief and subsequent happiness, as if you know exactly what's going on, because at some point in you're own life, you've probably experienced it. Going through the entire process of a break-up, Rob essentially functions as a mirror of every guy whose been in that very situation. The movie capture all those familiar quirky thoughts, those worst of fears visualizing in your head, the feelings of self-loathing and hatred and the hope that the music you listen to will speak to you directly, and they're so well written and acted out, that by the time the ending credits hit you, it actually feels quite spooky.At this point, a word can be said about the casting. If there ever was a role made for John Cusack, this here is it. Portraying the juvenile, self-deprivating and melancholic Rob with his own distinguishable charismatic style and mannerisms, Cusack is just spot on. This is absolutely one of his best works. His constant narrations straight to the camera and audience, and as such, the breaking of the fourth wall makes it so much more tangible. Other roles include Jack Black, as one of Rob's co-workers, which he plays very similarly to all his characters, but with some great lines. Tim Robbins, as the new boyfriend, is also just plain awesome (which can be expected of Robbins), as is the relatively unknown Danish Iben Hjejle as Laura. The movie is also filled with some other celebrity roles, and don't miss the cameo appearance by Bruce Springsteen as a ""mentoring voice"" in Rob's head.To top it all of, let it be known that ""High Fidelity"" has one of the best soundtracks, ranging from Lou Reed, Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Blondie and Marvin Gaye to The Kinks and Queen. And to ignore the role this music has in ""High Fidelity"" would be more than unjust, since it is, like the title implies, the soul and essence here. Instead of just working as background and fill-in for the on screen events, these are hand-picked tracks, sometimes played by the characters, but mostly just adding that exactly right momentum to the scenes that makes you want to smile. Like the soundtrack of your life, this is a movie everyone should see at least once, with, or without, you're significant other by your side.",High Fidelity

And in the book the top five all-time desert island break-ups list was a bit different, anyway, I still don't get why I liked it that much.  I mean I'm not a big John Cusack fan or anything, and that was the first movie I saw with Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Jack Black was great though, I don't think I would have even bothered with this movie if they had anyone other than him to play the part of Barry, it just works!  Anyway, this definetly makes my top five all-time favorite movies about failing musicians list ;).  It seriously does though.",High Fidelity
255,Little Jo,Some Kinda Wonderful,10,13 September 2000,"Okay, I admit it I had my doubts.  The ultimate London bloke author's best book (before he wrote About A Boy) was getting moved to Chicago and was going to have an American cast. ""How can they do this"" I cried. It's meant to be London. It's about British blokeism. Hush my mouth! This is just fantastic. Cusak is a revelation. Good looking enough to be worth watching but believable as somebody who would get himself into a state over trying to figure out women. All the performances are great. Black gets a special mention though. Just too funny for words. This will make you laugh out loud, but like all of Hornby's stuff is also packed with enough pathos to bring a lump to your throat at times too. The soundtrack is perfect and brilliantly reflects the tone of the movie.Interestingly the cinema I saw it at, the audience was packed with squads of blokes on various guys nights out. Interesting that underneath the surface this movie is just really I rom-com, but maybe I shouldn't tell them that. Roll on the movie of ""About A Boy"". Nick, when's your next book coming out?",High Fidelity
256,Tom-116,"Sweet, Pleasant, and Honest... With an awesome soundtrack",9,18 March 2000,"Everything about this movie made me feel good about myself.  While i have not read Nick Hornby's novel, the story seems to ring a real brutal truth to it.  Setting John Cusack as the main character was brilliant, as he is king of the ""I screwed up my relationship"" movie.  The movie centers around his love for women and music and how he struggles to get over the most recent girl that he has lost.  The film almost seems like a documentary, Cusack talks to the camera, like an actor on a stage speaking to the audience.  He makes top five lists of everything from painful breakups to the best songs about death (which sounds morbid, but really isn't). Being brutally honest about how men deal with emotional pain is what makes this movie good.  There are enough comic moments in the film to make Cusack's depression not so bad(the movie is a comedy after all).  Jack Black is also very good as the most obnoxious employee ever.  This film also has the greatest 80's soundtrack ever made, and I'm going to buy it for sure when it comes out.  In my top five movies of 2000 as of 3/18/00, High Fidelity is #1.",High Fidelity
257,conedm,Finest movie I've seen in a long time,9,21 September 2003,"Without doubt, this is one of the finest movies I've seen in a long time. The story has a very surprising perspective, in which the main character addresses you directly, therefore soaking you into his life.
Good laughs, funny dialogs compensate for a more serious underlying theme: ""what has sexual freedom done to the way we handle relationships"".
Actually this movie is good, that it's even fun to watch the outtakes included on the DVD.",High Fidelity
258,JunkieJoe,Speak to me,10,13 April 2003,"High Fidelity is one rare gem of a movie that speaks volumes to anyone who has loved and lost, or just loved at all.A story of that uncomfortable point in one's life where you question the wisdom of your friends, and have to make a decision about who you are and where you want to be.  In my opinion this is John Cusack's finest work.  See this movie, many, many times, and you just might learn something.Brilliant.",High Fidelity

I just got hold of the remastered Blu-ray and liked the movie now even more . The whole cast is great every one can act !

260,SvenErik,Forget the critics,10,10 August 2000,"I can't believe I almost did not see this movie!I read a critique in a Sydney newspaper which called the movie pretty lame and unrealistic (""why would a woman stick around with a guy like that in the first place?""). I guess the particular writer must have been deaf and blind. Hey, I am all for equal opportunity - but as a movie critic?
I did finally see it (almost being dragged along by friends) and spent the next 2 hours trying gasping for air because I was laughing so hard. Besides being funny (the description of the high society around Chris aka gorgeous Catharina Zeta-Jones almost saw me on the floor), it is also a very musical movie (as if the title wasn't a dead give-away) but even more so about typical men in our times and their troubles with relationships, love and sex. Men beware, from time to time you will recognize yourself in this piece - and you will not like it!On the other hand the whole story, the whole movie is centered around John Cusack - he not only acts (fabulously as usual I have to admit), he also directs and writes bits of it. Just my luck that I happen to like him :-) That does not mean that the other actors are mere ornaments - his two side kicks in the record shop are brilliant, as is his (ex) girl-friend, ex being what this movie is about. She leaves him, and even though he tries to cover it up, tries to play it down, it hurts him more than anything before. At the beginning we ask ourselves with him: what is so special about her? But as the movie progresses and she keeps showing up getting her stuff from their apartment, we learn to appreciate her, and more and more dislike our main character for loosing her. But hey, this is a movie with a couple of twists, and in the end ... but see for yourself. Definitely recommended.",High Fidelity
261,Ty-12,Probably the best film of 2000,7,17 October 2000,"Too bad that's not saying much. This is a Gen-X'ers Annie Hall with great performances by Cusack who's character spends most of the time speaking to the camera. Some people found it distracting but I liked the way it was done. Cusack is probably the most gifted and natural actor over the last 15 years and will probably be as close to a Spencer Tracy or a Gregory Peck(in terms of consistent performances) that I'll see in my lifetime.The characters were funny stereotypes of the basic fan-boys who seem to dominate the landscape of the fringe scenes. Eerily similar to a lot of the people I grew up with and the movie is a good satire of what the 30-somethings have turned into. Either the no-lifers or the overachieving, materialistic snobs. It's interesting to see how some recent films have touched on this one way or the other and I hope a true ""Graduate-type movie"" is somewhere on the horizon that will really put this age into perspective.It's always nice to see some unexpected cameos however Catherine Zeta Jones didn't quite fit in. Also, it could have probably used a couple of minutes more of editing.All in all a good movie that should stand up well over the years.7.5/10",High Fidelity
262,dr. gonzo,a refreshingly honest and cliché-free romantic comedy.,9,10 May 2000,"Have you ever spent hours organizing your record collection in chronological order and by genre? Have youever had heated debates with your friends about the meritsof a band who lost one of its founding members? Or argued about your top five favourite B-sides? If so, chancesare you will love High Fidelity, a film for and about characters obsessed with their favourite bands and music.Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is an obsessed music junkie who owns a record store called Championship Vinyl. He has just broken up with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a long-timegirlfriend and the latest in a countless string of failedrelationships. Rob addresses us directly throughout thefilm (just like Woody Allen did in his 1977 film, Annie Hall)about this latest breakup and how his top five break-ups ofall-time inform his most recent one. It's a great way forwhich Rob to try and come to terms with his shortcomingsand the reasons why his past relationships did not workout. He is talking directly to us and in doing so we relate tohim and his dilemma a lot easier.Along the way we meet a colourful assortment of characters, from his past girlfriends (that includes thediverse likes of Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones) to hisco-workers at Championship Vinyl (Jack Black and Todd Louiso). They really flesh out the film to such a degree that Ifelt like I was seeing aspects of my friends and myself inthese characters. Being a self-confessed obsessive typewhen it comes to music and film, I could easily relate tothese people and their problems.And that's why High Fidelity works so well for me. Theextremely funny and wryly observant script by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and John Cusack (the same teambehind the excellent Grosse Pointe Blank) not only zeroesin on what it is to love something so passionately but whyother things (like relationships) often take a backseat as aresult. A girlfriend might not always be there for you, butyour favourite album or film will. A song will never judge youor walk out on you and there is a kind of comfort in that.The screenplay also makes some fantastic observations on how men view love and relationships. Throughout thefilm Cusack's character delivers several monologues to usabout his thoughts on past love affairs, one of my favouritebeing the top five things he liked about Laura. It's atouching, hopelessly romantic speech that reminded me alot of Woody Allen's list of things to live for in Manhattan(1979).The screenplay works so well because not only it is wellwritten but it also features a solid ensemble cast. The roleof Rob Gordon is clearly tailor-made for John Cusack. Robcontains all the trademarks of the kinds of characters he'sknown for: the cynical, self-deprecating humour, the love of80s music, and the inability to commit to the woman of hisdreams. Even though High Fidelity is not directed by Cusack, like Grosse Pointe Blank, it is clearly his film, rightdown to the casting of friends in front of and behind thecamera (i.e. actors Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, his sisterJoan, and screenwriters, D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink).The rest of the cast is also fantastic, in particular, JackBlack and Todd Louiso as the two guys who work at Championship Vinyl. Louiso's Dick is a shy, introverted guythat you can imagine listening to The Smiths religiously,while Black's Barry is a rude, annoying blowhard who sayseverything you wish you could actually say in public. It's aflashy, scene-stealing role that Black does to perfection.And yet, his character isn't overused and only appears atthe right moments and for maximum comic effect. His sparing usage in High Fidelity made me want to see moreof him, which is why he works so well.Even though the world and the characters in High Fidelityare unashamedly of a rarified type: the obsessive musicgeek or elitist, which some people may have trouble relating to, the film's conclusion suggests that there ismuch more to life than one's all-consuming passion forthese things. It also helps to be passionate about someone. And that message is delivered in a refreshinglyhonest and cliché-free fashion as it provides what is ultimately the humanist core of High Fidelity.",High Fidelity
263,Hitchcock-3,"Good Satire, Rehashed Philosophy",6,24 April 2000,"After seeing High Fidelity I had mixed feelings about the film.  The satire of rock & roll-aholics was dead on target; I loved Cusack's inumerous top-5 lists and mix-tapes.  The philosophy; however, I found to be muddled. Whenever Cusack seems to come to a revelation, I couldn't relate.  Finally, it must be mentioned that Jack Black & Todd Louiso as Cusack's record-store employees are wonderful.  Wait for video if you're looking for a decent romantic comedy, but if you have a love or hate relationship with rock and roll, you must see this movie. GRADE: B/B+",High Fidelity
264,John Book,"Vinyl, love, fear, vinyl, rejection, love, vinyl, love vinyl.",10,2 April 2000,"It's great to watch a film that you can relate to, it's another to see a part of your life on there.  It could have been a part of my real life, right down to wondering when love you hit you at the right time, and when that right time is.  But most of all, the many quirks about record collecting, music discussion, and the ""elitist"" attitudes one has when you appreciate music.  It's not a ""music"" film, but rather music circles the life of John Cusack's character, coming up with Top 5 lists, lyrical verses, and references to the first songs on Side 1 of any album as a metaphor for his need for romance.  Of course, diehard collectors will complain that the movie is not an accurate adaptation of Nick Hornsby's book, but who cares? It's a funny film with heart, and it gives credibility to all the record collecting nerds out there.  File under ""Movie: Great"".",High Fidelity
265,mikecalla,Drags On,3,16 July 2001,"There was something about this movie that seemed to drag on indefinitely. The pace of the story seemed painstakingly slow and most redundant at times. As for the advertised hilarity, only the character of Barry (Jack Black) seemed to strain for laughs. John Cusacks character (Rob) was downright melancholic in comparison, and through repeated viewing (not by my choice), I find myself yelling insults at his pathetic character constantly obsessing over girl troubles all the way down to his childhood loves. Also, I realized that Stephen Frears used addiction, or love of, if you prefer, vinyl to contrast all the relationship problems, it just didn't come off as being honest enough.  Instead of recommending High Fidelity try Annie Hall by Woody Allen, a superior in every aspect, including the dialogue delivered to audience.",High Fidelity

That isn't saying that it's not good enough. The first time you watch this movie, you  will fall in love with it. But to fully appreciate the amazing performances, breathtaking love story, and the highly intellectual humor you must watch it twice, three times, four times......The outstanding monologues could have only been pulled off in the way John Cusack does, by him. There is no substitute for his presence in this film. If you weren't satisfied by his performance in Being John Malkovich, well this will confirm that John is one of the most true and original actors around today.JB is just plain AWESOME!! Hilarious, clever, and an incredible singer!!

267,Drew-44,Top 5 Reasons This Could Have Been Better,6,3 April 2000,"As was Cusack's habit of naming top 5s (can't come up with songs right now), 1) The setup for the movie was too long. 2) Once the setup was established, they should have rethought it. 3) The scene with the record store packed with people seemed to be a big occasion (Laura asking about it), but it looked like the lead-in was cut. 4) Laura took Rob back without much effort on his part and 5) We only saw Catherine Zeta-Jones topless from the back (okay, that's a lame one, but still!).  Cusack loves making quirky movies and this one was no exception.  I wavered between a 6 and 7 for voting (would have given 6.5 if you could), but had to go with a 6 because this isn't a movie I would tell people to run out and see.  Supporting roles by Todd Louiso and Jack Black were a riot and helped carry the picture. Lots of great surprise cameos too!",High Fidelity
268,Jailynn,Boring!,1,23 April 2000,I thought this movie was one of the most boring movies I have had the misfortune of seeing in a long time.  I am not completely sure what all the hype was about.  Maybe I didn't like it because I don't spend all my time incessantly whining about why my relationships fail miserably and I just enjoy life....who knows!  The only upside of the movie was the two record store employees.  They brought some much needed comic relief!  I would recommend this as a rental at best.,High Fidelity
269,tcuthbertson,One of my top 5 movies...(you'll get it after you see it),10,30 March 2000,"High Fidelity leads the audience through the lovelife of Rob Gordon (Cusack) as narrated by Gordon himself.  Rob has recently had a breakup with his girlfriend of several years, and this opens up a period of time in his life where he begins asking whether he is incompetent in relationships or merely if relationships are inherently faulty.  This dialogue with the audience is punctuated with hilarious instances of conflict with the two music nerds that work at Gordon's music store.  The choices of music in this movie are fantastic because most of them are quite obscure yet very good--perfect for a movie about music gurus.  Most of the acting is performed nearly flawlessly.  High Fidelity reminds me a lot of Annie Hall both in quality and content (although this one is more post-modern).  In fact, you could almost call this a Woody Allen movie without that annoying, neurotic Jewish guy.  The plot has numerous twists and turns without seeming busy, and the narrative format is perfect for conveying the personal tribulations that Gordon experiences.  I've given High Fidelity a tentative 10. . .almost a nine but the music is so good.  This one will surely be a classic sometime.",High Fidelity

It started the wheels turning in my head, about how my own relationship was going.  Before I could get all of my thoughts sorted, she ended our two year relationship, luckily.  On the night after she left me, I watched this film again, and it helped to start putting things in perspective.  I then watched it on each of our aniversaries for three months, and by the last time I had watched it, I had sorted out the entirety of our relationship into one little idea: ""Top 5 words that describe my relationship with @#$%&*"" I wont say what these are, but they were not too kind to @#$%&* This movie could change your life too, especially if you're stuck in a poor relationship, or your relationship is seems frozen in time.Also, it is a damned hilarious film.

Well, just so I can get it out of the way, This movie is about me""Based on Nick Hornby's book of the same title, this rendition is stirring, well thought out, well acted, and subtle.  So few times in movies do we get to hear character's really talk to each other, much less hear what they are thinking.  This is a role in which Cusak could have gone horribly wrong, but instead he fills the role with a touching sense of frailty while still putting on a mask of masculinity and machoism, and, if you think about it, that is what your twenties and thirties are all about.

However, ""feature-length"" movies are always nice to see as oppose to the all too short 80 minute ones.ACTING: Hilarious. Jack Black, as always, never fails to please a viewer. He's rash, crude and way over the top - perfect performance as the wacky Barry. The other co-stars who play Dick and Laura are great, although the girl who plays Laura seemed like she was just put there cos she was a pretty face. Could be better.As usual, I have no faults with John Cusack's performance. This man is just talent beyond talent. He's normal joe guy one minute and insane record shop owner the next. He really draws you into the world with a life and personality that easily grows on you.MUSIC: Brilliant.

275,NelioCuomo,This is in the top five movies of all-time,9,17 September 2008,"One of the top five best movies of all-time about the fear and loneliness that is settling down. I decided to revisit this masterpiece after I paged through Nick Hornby's novel that inspired this Chicago filmed classic.It is unbelievable that movies can sometimes just hit you and let you know that other people have experienced exactly what you're feeling (probably one billion times before, like even cavemen looked at their girlfriends once or twice and said, ""that's it, eh?""). Most people will take this as a movie about breaking up (but it's not), and lots of people just see this move as a chick-flick for dudes (but it sort of is). It's the greatest dude-flick of all time (if you count Terminator 2 and The Matrix as ""guy movies"" and say Swingers as another ""dude flick"").Being a business owner in his mid-twenties who used to live in the same neighborhood Championship Vinyl was in skews my opinion a bit, but I have to say that the movie is about growing up in the twentieth century. We're not supposed to be married at twenty-one anymore and that creates a lot of time to mess up our relationships and turn into jaded, pessimistic, intelligent, nerds. Cusack is so believable in this role, and you like this character so much that you find yourself defending his flaws in your own mind. He creates a character that allows the viewer to suspend judgment. I suddenly find myself scanning through the minutia of my own hobbies looking for the smallest details to enjoy. Few movies make you think about them after they're long done, but I make constant correlations to myself and Rob as much as possible. It becomes a parable to live by.It gets a nine because the ending isn't perfect. Most of the time I turn the movie off right when the girl comes in to give him an interview. I can't stand the real ending of this movie, or the book for that matter. This movie is so much like real life that it kills me that the ending drapes itself in a fairy tale. As if to say, ""Okay ladies, I know you'd all be angry if it ended like real life right now, so to please all sexes I'll throw a little happy ending in for you."" Hmm... sounds like a masseuse I know...There are scenes in the book where Rob is hanging out with his parents that are not in the movie. Where Rob contemplates suicide because some nerd-looking-thirty-five-year-old enjoying a movie with his parents smiles at him to clue him into being in the same predicament. Rob takes the smile as a clue-in to his hell. It's a classic reading moment where you're literally laughing out loud (instead of the figurative internet way that makes my brain want to explode). Plus, the whole funeral scene is completely different in the movie. The book in general really comes off as so much more anti-women. Laura isn't so damn lovable. Except that I really don't see how people can find Iben Hjejle sexy, or even likable really.Cusack is better in this movie, than anything I've seen him in. Jack Black is perfect as Barry and is closest to his novel character. I can very much tell Jack Black is a Hornby fan (hmmm.... thirty-something stoner with a rock band... is that such a stretch?) I can sit around saying how great the book was, but the only thing that matters is that the movie really gave it justice and if I'm Nick Hornby, I owe a big one to Frears and Cusack for really giving my readership a little (no, a big) reach-around.",High Fidelity
276,yousoldmysoulforpogs,Youth-savvy!,9,15 March 2008,"It's a movie with John Cusack, Jack Black and Iben Hjejle (who, by the way, is the cutest girl I've seen in a film since Audrey Tatou in Amelie). I had heard about the book and the film quite a while ago in passing - probably on Wikipedia - and when I heard that the film featured loads of music and film references, I was intrigued. I had seen ""Tapeheads"" before, which was both Tim Robbins' and John Cusack's first feature film in which they acted. ""Tapeheads"" was about the two starting a music video directing company. It's was really strange, and absurd to say the least - very very very 80's! Just to tell you what the film is about. It's about a man (Robert) in his thirties who lives in Chicago and owns a record store. He has a great fondness for popular music, and likes to talk about music if he can in conversation - in fact, there's one scene in which he discusses the ""science and art of creating the perfect compilation"". Featured throughout the film are pretentious ""Top 5"" lists he compiles - like ""Top 5 opening tracks"" or ""Top 5 Dream Jobs"". The first one that he begins the film with is his ""Top 5 Worst Break-Ups"" and he proceeds to talk about them, through the aid of flashbacks. He has recently broken up with a girl named Laura (played by Hjejle), and has consequently positioned her at ""No. 5 with a bullet"" because she has decided to be with a ex-neighbour whom he particularly detests (incidently, played by Tim Robbins). He then seeks out his ""Top 4 Break-Ups"" in an attempt to discover why he always screws up with the opposite sex.I was very glad to have caught ""High Fidelity"" three minutes in on BBC1 - and am even more so now that I have seen it. Much like the ""Top 5"" lists featured in the film, there are films that just, once you've seen them once, you just adore them and want to share them with as many people as you can - High Fidelity is no exception, and makes my Top 5, I think.The film is essentially more about love than music or pop references however, but don't be expecting embarrassing clichés and whatnot! Every reference to love or relationships and everything isn't sweetly sick and all the funny moments are neatly scattered across the film to ensure that the ""love"" parts don't become too forced or cheesy. Love is dealt with within the film to a great big deal, but it's very subtle - and it's done in a very tidy way, with John Cusack giving soliloquies every second scene as to how he feels, and analysing what he wants.I think it's a great film for people my age - the bombardment of pop references do nothing but help this film achieve a ""youth-savvy"" status - and as a result, it helps people like me, who are still learning and coming to grips with the all relationships thing, to have an interest in this film, and Cusack's situations. The film explores the theme of not just falling in love, but also falling out of love - a topic not touched on by many authors or film-makers.I've only seen this film once, but I'm convinced it will stand the test of time, as they say, because it effectively demonstrates how messy and how confusing ""break-ups"" and ""get-back-together-agains"" inevitably are. And even despite the fact that I didn't recognise all of the tunes played, it's ""dated"" soundtrack is filled with old-fashioned, hearty music. It's good stuff - music that you don't have to put much effort into listening to appreciate it. This film doesn't need to be updated with today's popular hits for its music to remain modern - sounds perfectly cool as it is. (There's at least one Chemical Brothers song, so it's not all Belle & Sebastian or Stevie Wonder)",High Fidelity

How can a movie starring two great actors such as John Cusack and Jack Black be so lame? This was a complete waste of time. Usually I'll watch a movie till the end if I have invested some effort in watching it in the first place but with this I switched off half way through. I have no idea what all the hype was about. Its crap! This movie is essentially an hour and a half of a man whose body has grown but mind has stayed fixed in teenage mode whining about girlfriends he has loved and lost. That's it! To be honest if my good mates started talking like that I'd give them a slap and tell them to be a man so why the hell I would want to hear some stranger banging on I don't know.

Jack Black and Todd Louiso couldn't be better. Tim Robbins, as the world-music-fan, is a nice surprise, and Joan Cusack is always funny.It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making this movie, and the result is a nice and funny and full of emotions motion picture, to see again and again and again to remember how music and love can help each other.",High Fidelity

Even non-music geeks should check this out just for her performance which made this movie one of my personal top 5. Excellent soundtrack!",High Fidelity
280,krajo,perfect entertainment,10,18 June 2002,"My favourite movies are those that express some kind of mood, atmosphere, tone, name it what you like. Better yet a mix of feelings. This movie ranks very high on my scale, it has romance, comedy and a bit of sadness melted together.The best part is that it is the actors who make this work, not some kind of computer generated visual effects or thought-to-be-meaningful music.John Cusack was the perfect choice for this film, this makes him one of my favourite actors. I've seen him and Tim Robbins in a few films (The sure thing, The player) supporting each other, which is nice to see in our days of competing stars and starlets.Some say that the part of Laura should have been played by someone more glamourous or well known, but I think they miss the point of the whole film. Besides, towards the end of the film she shows why someone like Rob Gordon would love someone like her. I wonder if anyone catches it, here's a hint anyway: she laughs at Rob for taking something too seriously.Todd Louiso, Jack Black and others also play their roles well.10/10 in my book. bye, krajo",High Fidelity
281,crewgch,So much better than I expected,10,29 December 2000,"Who marketed this film?  They oughta be shot!  This movie looked like a definite ""wait till video""-flick based on the trailer and the marketing campaign.  It's amazing how Hollywood can make a terrible movie like ""Vertical Limit"" seem good and somehow totally miss with an excellent movie like High Fidelity.I saw the movie when it came out several months ago but I wanted to leave my comments on this website...What I remember most about this film is John Cusack's effortless performance.  And when I say effortless, I really mean ego-less.  I love an actor that is willing to honestly portray a guy that doesn't know it all, that doesn't have the great looks, basically able to play a human being (by the way JC is a good looking guy but he doesn't have to look his best). Actors have huge egos and sometimes that's all we get to see on the screen instead of the normal guy the writer intended to be on the screen.  John was amazing.  And when an actor does this good, you can't imagine anyone else playing his part.  Kinda like Forrest Gump, who else could've played that character other than Tom Hanks?The writing was top notch.  It could've easy fallen into cliche.  It succeeds dealing with cliches but it never allows the cliche to be the entire punchline.  It goes deeper.  Frankly, it dares to be honest.  I believed all the goings on in this film.  Wow, I totally related to the scenes when John's character revisits his past.  For example, it was such a great moment when John's character says regarding one of his old girlfriend's:  ""How did I delete all of this?""  If you've seen the movie, you know what scene I'm talking about.  Purely amazing and so true!Finally, the proposal was done so well.  Wow, how refreshing.  It was honest, well acted, no big score coming in telling the audience what to feel.  Such good movie making...One last nod... the record store was truly authentic.  I learned about another facet of life because of this movie.  The filmmakers took the time to do it right.Great work... and maybe it was meant to be insider pick.  Just like the record store itself.  It's not a pop movie.   This is a rare, hard to find-type movie, the kind that the only the clued-in people know about.  I'm not cool but I was lucky enough to stumble onto this movie.High Fidelity is one of a kind.",High Fidelity
282,genevadavid,Perfect Pitch,9,21 July 2003,"I've watched this movie twice this weekend, and I could easily see it again. It is a pleasure to watch such good acting and direction, even if the story revolves around a fellow in the process of maturing. I particularly liked Iben Hjejle's portrayal of Rob's latest girlfriend, Laura.  She is completely believable as the girlfriend ho seems to have matured six months ahead of Rob.  Of course, Jack Black's Barry electrifies the record store, but he stops short of going over the top.  He is perfectly balanced by Todd Louiso's deadpan Dick. Fortunately, these guys are around to relieve us from the Rob's self-centered examination of his failed relationships.  I haven't read the book (yet), but I appreciate characters who aren't afraid to say ""I don't know"", because they are still groping their way to the next stage in their lives.  So much of the dialogue feels realistic.  Finally, the music provides a terrific backdrop.  People change; styles change.  At one point, Rob is dismissive of Peter Frampton, but his ears open up when he hears ""Baby I Love Your Way"" interpreted by Lisa Bonet's Marie De Salle.  The same is true of Barry's rendition of a Marvin Gaye tune.  Growing and maturing is all about seeing, hearing and feeling things that you weren't aware of before.  This film conveys that process wonderful by weaving music into the story of Rob's love life. Bravo!",High Fidelity
283,thanhlienanh-vo,Watch this movie. I guarantee you will enjoy every minute of it.,8,26 October 2011,"This movie is excellent, it is a perfect romantic comedy. For all ages, all genders, all kinds of whatever personality you have.Rob Gordon (John Cusack) – a record store owner is dumped by his latest girlfriend. He asks himself: ""What came first: the misery or the music?"" and decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the top 5 all time greatest breakups in his love life. Despite the simple storyline, the movie is highly humorous, poignant, yet a very informative look at men, relationships and love. Top 5 breakups he went through are necessarily 5 stages of so-called love every boy must learn when growing up. It includes ""childish love"" from a little high school boy, crave for sex teenager, so-called love for an out-of-my-league university star, rebound relationship, and true love. Simple, yet creative, refreshing and original movie.John Cusack was at his best in this movie. He portrayed the characters just like any ordinary man in real life. Anyone can relate to him. He's fun, cute, playing hard on the outside but fragile on the inside, simple and complex at the same time. The supporting cast were excellent. Todd Louiso and Jack Black – one music geek in the classic sense of the word and one cruel, ridiculous elitist – stole every scene they are in. They were fantastically funny, especially when they insulted customers.Watch this movie.

284,ems97,For All Reflective Men,10,8 April 2012,"This movie portrays a man who hyper-displays many stereotypical male characteristics: collecting and categorizing, aggression, inability to take corrections. This man talks to the camera, defending his behavior. To the audience, though, it is clear that his actions are totally silly. I think the point of the movie is to make men like myself think about whether we sometimes have some of the traits portrayed by the main character. For me, one of the things that struck a chord: getting super- excited after it now appears that there is the remotest possibility a relationship, any relationship, going forward (in the movie, ""We Are the Champions"" plays in the soundtrack here). Also, being more concerned about whether we share interests with a potential partner than whether we are interested in her. So I have a lot to reflect over after watching the movie. I'm sure other scenes will lead other male viewers to reflect on their personal lives.",High Fidelity
285,angelic_wounds,Might be the only rom - com that throws the spotlight to a male character,9,25 December 2017,"Most rom - coms made in Hollywood were either told by a woman or written/thought by one, so we always got a one sided affair that contained emotional swings, unreal scenarios, fantasy endings and plot twists that only strengthen the happy ending; an ideal scenario to a female fantasy regarding love, born out of fairytales. Additionally, when such movies were more realistic and on the mature side, they continued to tell the story through a woman's lenses. High Fidelity is such a poignant chapter in the Hollywood annals of romantic comedies precisely because it breaks the norm - the story of love, sorrow, confliction, friendship and personal psyche is finally told by a male's point of view, and explained in a very realistic scenario of a simple, every day man. Rob Gordon (John Cusack) owns a record store in Chicago, and he is going through a break up. A man who always seems to have everything sorted and in order, he narrates through the whole movie, cataloguing his top 5 break ups up to the recent one, explaining the reason they occurred.Through the course of the film, we see him going through the motions of his break up, the so called five stages of grief, so to speak. Along the way, with his ex - girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) constantly on the forefront of his mind, Rob tries to sort out his feelings, going into deep musical conversations with his employees Barry (Jack Black), an elitist music lover who often connects day events with a ""top 5 tracklist"", and Dick (Todd Louiso), the sentimental part of the trio. Along the way, Rob goes through a soul search of his own, eventually coming to conclusions about his character, his behaviour, and acceptance that for love and a relationship to survive, you have to take a leap of faith into the unknown.Do not believe that this movie is anything sappy, for it remains a comedy for the bigger portion of its 2 hour course. Black ensembles a perfect character on himself, and you'll definitely laugh with his constant opinion on contemporary and old music alike, especially when he downgrades a poor old customer about it. Cusack is as believable as it gets, bringing forth every emotion possible associated with falling in love, from anger to envy, and nostalgia to care. Above all, it's a very educational film into the male psyche, and will definitely become a favourite of both genders, because it lacks any ""fairytale ending"". It's a dive into an emotional trip, seen through the eyes of an everyday man, where it is bound to stay with you long after the credits roll.",High Fidelity

287,sgauss,"Witty, cool, apparently not for everyone",8,2 January 2001,"I browsed the comments for this movie before writing this, and was surprised by the number of reviewers who didn't like this movie, especially since I had just watched it twice (mostly)!  I'll do something different here.Things to like:1.  John Cusack.  I like his body of work.  My favorites range from ""Better Off Dead"" (another controversial choice?) to Grosse Pointe Blank and Being John Malkovich. 2.  Great cameos by Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor.  Anything that three of those five want to do a cameo in is worth thinking about.  The bits for all five were great. 3.  Music.  I probably teetered on the edges of some of the excesses of music the main characters indulge in.  There was a broad selection of music by different eras.  Don't expect to hear too many obvious songs though - no Beatles, no ""Free Bird"". 4.  The music geeks.  A couple of great supporting characters.  If you saw the performance by Jack Black near the end of the movie, it probably raised your rating of this movie by a full point. 5.  The ending is emotionally satisfying. 6.  Non-linear flow, talking to the camera.  Arty, change of pace, can be a lot of fun.Things to hate: I don't fully agree with all of these, although I see the point of view of those who don't.1.  Rob Gordon.  Cusack's character is an immature jerk.  I don't consider that a fault of the acting or the writing. 2.  The music and the music geeks.  A lot of the music is obscure, and our heroes are snobs. 3.  The ending is a little pat. 4.  Non-linear flow, talking to the camera.  Apparently not everyone's cup of tea.There's a lot of overlap there!",High Fidelity
288,Desertdback,High Fidelity is stunningly great !,9,30 January 2001,"Wow!That is the word that first came to mind after watching this movie for the first time.  When renting this movie, I never in my wildest dreams thought that this would be rated with a ""9""!   I didn't expect such a dramatic but yet comedic life of a guy that is like almost every other guy.  A guy (John Cusack) that is looking for that perfect girl, but never seems to find her no matter how many women he goes through, but then he realizes that he has the perfect woman and it is already too late.  Yes, this movie is crafted around music and the love of it, but the greatest thing I got out of watching this movie was look at something you have and really take a look at how special it or they really are, before it is too late to get it back.",High Fidelity
289,catbyte9,Lloyd Doppler grows up (a little bit),8,7 October 2000,"John Cusack has always made wonderful movies about relationships (or even if the movies weren't wonderful, his performances were) and this movie continues that trend.  Set in Seattle, Director Stephan Frears has made High Fidelity one of the truest, most honest films about modern relationships that I've seen.  Cusack plays it almost as a sequel to Say Anything, his character, Rob, is what Lloyd Doppler could have grown into.  The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially Jack Black and Todd Louiso as his Record Store employees.  My only complaint with this movie would be that with the number of great actors in this movie, people like Joan Cusack and Lisa Bonet (just to name two) had far too little to do (and this isn't even counting the fact that Harold Ramis was actually cut from the movie).  If you like John Cusack, you'll love this movie.",High Fidelity
290,marie_baie_des_anges,TOP 250? I don't think so,6,10 November 2000,"The most singular most interesting thing about this movie is that it made it to the IMdb Top 250 list.  I am not saying that certain parts were not enjoyable, but the movie as a whole was a disappointment.  I rented this movie expecting more of a comedy.  Instead, I got a movie that was more about a defunct relationship and a man trying to breath life into it.  The only enjoyable parts took place in the video store with the very underrated actor Jack Black and funny actor Todd Louiso.  I am a big fan of John Cusack, but he did nothing that he has not done previously.  This romantic comedy failed because it should have centered more around the ""comedy"" component instead of almost ignoring it to a degree.  I did not sympathize or care for the characters at all and I really did not want them to stay together.  They were like children.  Laura left him and wanted him to get over her, yet she showed up everywhere he was.  She called him, she was always around him I just wanted this ridiculous game they were playing to finish.  The movie dragged.  And for some odd reason, I felt suddenly very tired after watching it.  I do not know where the praise for this film came from.  I think that Pushing Tin (similar in that it was about an ended/ending relationship) was much better than this bore of a movie and yet, it has like a 6 and people are so very critical of it on the IMdb. That movie had an equal amount of comedy and romance.  This movie, was more romantic, but I thought it was very unromantic.  The other good aspects (those of which are few) of this movie is that John Cusack as the dumped boyfriend had bad qualities.  He was not perfect, he was somewhat the protagonist with human faults.  The music of course was great.  And I believe this is why High Fidelity is praised.  People love that the movie incorporates classic songs instead of modern ones to give an underlying message in the movie. Don't waste your money on this movie, unless you:A)Love John Cusack B)Love music C)Can relate to a truly messed up and almost hopeless relationship. D)You have enough caffeine to maintain yourself awake through the two hour something long movie.",High Fidelity

293,Farp_rock,Do i listen to pop music coz i'm miserable or am i miserable coz i listen to pop music?,8,30 March 2005,"Not only does it do a fabulous character study of us males, but it also sits well with women too, showing the universal appeal to this film. It's so effective and simple. A really simple story line of a man whos made many mistakes in his life, finds himself alone again after a breakup. He proceeds to go through his life categorically through 'Top 5' things. Including top 5 breakups, this is to discover himself in a way and why relationships have failed with him.The way the movie is done is tremendous, the film is fully focused on Rob Gordon, he talks into the camera as if its a diary, and we see everything through his eyes. And look into his past with him and the present, The characters in this movie are tremendous. Barry played by Jack Black, takes the cake he is simply hilarious! an absolutely genius performance as Rob's co-worker. And the quiet, insecure yet lovably opinionated Dick (Todd Louiso) The two workers are the complete opposite to each other- Barry's loud foul mouthed and highly opinionated to Dicks's quiet nervous demeanor is a superb comic dynamic. These 2 serve to make Cusack look like the normal one of the gang. Cusack's top 5 thing is instantly relatable, i do that often with everything. ANd everybody wishes, well i do anyway that there is a camera you can talk into to relate your life into! Cusack's relationship problems throughout his life are easy to relate to for both sexes not just males. Its also universally appealing with the huge influence of music, his life is music and he sets songs for his moods which i'm sure we've all done. I remember when i first watched it after one of my relationships broke up, i prophesied by it! the stuff is just so...true! Its still a comedy and there is plenty of humour throughout-Cusack portrays a tremendous character and very funny. Everybody is tremendous innit Catherine Zeta JOnes, Joan Cusack have small but effective roles. The main love interest seems slightly wooden, but shes nice to look at! English is her second language in real life and the girl at times looked as if her American accent was slightly forced. However thats a minute detail to a wonderfully uplifting and probably of all films i have seen this is the most down to earth and relatable film in my list.",High Fidelity
294,HanPolo,Relationships + Music + TopFive Lists + The 90s = My #1 Favorite Movie of All Time,8,20 March 2013,"The fact that this is my favorite movie (at least since 2007) and I still gave it a 8 out of 10 speaks mainly to my acknowledgment that the movie lacks some critical elements that make a ""Classic Movie."" However, for the sheer scope and ubiquity of the subject matter tackled in High Fidelity, I rank it #1 in my All-time favorite movies category.First off, it approaches relationships from the perspective of any emotionally confused, disenfranchised, 20something male, making it a rare gem for that viewing demographic. The opening sequence launches directly into this motif, as Rob's girlfriend (Laura) is packing her things to leave as he primes us for the main theme of the movie: tracing his relationships with women to the present day in an attempt to uncover a solution to his broken love life. His revelations throughout the narrative reflect the selfishness inherent in his age, and by the time he comes to an emotional nirvana at the end, you almost want him to suffer a lonely life (but not in a sequel). Alas, this story is happier than reality would allow him to be.The musical flavor of the narrative is central in the same way that the computer theme was central in the Tron movies. Music saturates this movie. Rob (John Cusack) is a music lover running a record store in the heart of Chicago, which gave us modern Jazz and House. Although technically a 90s genre film, the script (which comes from the eponymous British novel) references music from all eras of musicology, and one scene in particular, in which Rob and his store crew (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are referred to as ""music snobs,"" resonates beyond the film's own yearbook to a future that includes the ""indie kid"" and ""hipster"" generation.Finally, two aspects of this movie appealed to me in particular, and launched the movie into my #1 spot: the art of the Top Five list and the cult of the 90s. I love Top Five lists, and if you ever have a hard time small-talking someone, just ask them to name their Top Five of anything. Most people will say they like too much stuff to rank any of it, but that's malarkey because once you say your Top Five they'll argue with at least one of your choices, meaning they do have the capacity for ranking things. This movie starts with a Top Five list, which is basically how Rob outlines the order in which he will investigate his previous love interests: the Top Five Worst Breakups in His Life. As for the importance of the 90s setting, let me just clarify by saying that the 1990s are in my Top Five favorite decades list. Musically, it may be #1.The shortcomings that dropped it a couple of spots (I never give movies a 10) are nitpicky, but evident enough to limit the movie's rewatchability. One such shortcoming is the seemingly free-wheeling script given to Jack Black. Some of the things he says and does appear, well, too Jack Blackish for the movie I want to watch, and he wears thin early on as an obnoxious, abrasive, and fatuous character who wouldn't have many friends in real life (not that he does in the movie...). Katherine Zeta's lines are similarly contrived, as are a few other roles. Another pitfall is the pointless plot detour at the end of the movie when Rob is deciding about his long-term life with Laura and encounters an informed local music journalist. Sparks fly, and just as we think the movie could get 20 minutes longer, it doesn't.Although there are enough problems with this movie to bring it down a notch or two, it does include my favorite movie elements all in one feature presentation: it's funny, it approaches love from the guy's perspective, it's musically themed, it includes Top Five lists, it's set in the 90s, and it takes place somewhere other than New York or California.I highly recommend seeing (and owning) this movie if you like at least two of those elements.",High Fidelity
295,cynthia-ostrich,Nice to Know I am Not Alone,9,25 June 2013,"As a John Cusack fan this is one of my all-time favorite films he has been in. It is also nice to know when it comes to the things I am a good at (music, movies, Top 5 lists, sucking at relationships) I am not alone. High Fidelity is a funny and delightful telling of the relationship problems of Rob Gordon (Cusack), a struggling record store owner, as he recounts where he went wrong in life with the women he has loved. Gordon breaks the fourth wall of the camera to confide in us where he has gone wrong. It is also a funny telling of the insight of men and their thought processes when it comes to life and relationships.The cast is what makes the humor and heart of this film. Todd Louiso and Jack Black play Rob's music snob (somewhat loser) employees. Rob: ""I can't fire them. I hired these guys for three days a week and they just started showing up every day. That was four years ago."" Tim Robbins is also hilarious in his small cameo role as Rob's romantic rival Ian Raymond. Perhaps one of the funniest parts of the whole film is when Ian/Ray comes to the record shop for a little conflict resolution and Rob's priceless reaction to the situation.Author Nick Hornby wrote the original novel that this film was based on. I enjoyed the movie so much that it made me a fan of Hornby and have read most of his novels. I think that this movie has probably created many fans for Hornby and his writings.",High Fidelity

The plot is wavy and the characters stop developing after the first third of the movie. Not that they develop in that first third but at least you have something to be paying attention to in character introduction. An exploration of romantic relationships? Ha! I do not think so.

306,DirtyGrainius,Maybe it's better for people who....,7,18 September 2005,"I saw this movie when it originally came out, but had missed a large portion of the beginning. I think I liked it and had always wanted to see all of it, especially because I wanted to see all the top 5 lists I missed. So I rented it today.It is a decent film. I don't think it's great, or as good as I felt is was before. The main reason is that all the trials and tribulations Rob goes through, just seem like a waste of time. How can you feel empathy for a character that has the time and luxury to do all this worrying and scrutinizing? Especially when it comes out that most of the problems he suffered were self-induced. How can you forget that you dumped a girl because she didn't put out? Or not realize that someone you were dating before was a whack-job? It just seems like if any decisions that should have been pondered earlier weren't, and that again makes it tough to swallow a character who is obviously very into introspection.Another problem for me was that we have seen so much more of Jack Black's antics since this movie was released, that his part did seem more tame this go-round. He is still one of the strongest characters in the movie however. I also didn't wholly understand Lisa Bonet's character. Was she the actualization of the 'Fantasy Girl' girl Rob talks about later, just for an emphasis in reality that the ideal is un-attainable in any sense of permanency? If not, why didn't he just stick with her. There were some really funny parts, and it had a nice sweet ending, but I did find myself looking at the movie timer quite a bit. I now have a strong urge to go read the novel, and maybe that'll open up some things that I didn't get straight away from the film. I wanted to give it 6/10, but I guess it does have enough of that little something that I can give it a 7/10.",High Fidelity
307,Rayban-4,Interesting film - not quite what I expected,9,1 April 2000,"Just glancing over some of the reviews in the papers, it looked as if High Fidelity was going to be a pure comedy.  The trailers didn't give away anything in the movie - it ended up being a pleasant surprise.  The humour in the movie is the same style you'll find in Grosse Pointe Blank.  John Cusack plays the boy-who-never-grew-up really well.  The entire movie is one, long monologue, but it's spaced out well with humourous interludes and completely unexpected situations.  I was also glad to see Joan Cusack as one his co-stars.  Definitely a good watch: just enough comedy to keep it interesting and a touch of romance to let you walk out feeling good.",High Fidelity
308,drjhcrow,Hip and amusing view of a man discovering his feelings about a woman.,8,31 March 2000,John Cusack stars as a young man with a relationship problem.  He cannot put his finger on his feelings about his girl friend - who has just dumped him. The little scenes and a bit of madness are very entertaining.  The supporting cast is quirky and reliably funny throughout the movie.  some of the music is pretty good too.  Tim Robbins plays a real jerk in a minor but essential role.  Quite a good movie really.  JHC,High Fidelity

The film says that women are a great but sometimes weird species and that it takes a lot of time and heart to get along with them. OK! Maybe this is nothing new. We`ve seen stories like this before. But in this movie we got real people! People we can meet on the street tomorrow, this is not this all beautiful, all happy Hollywood crap. The only cliche is, that it always rains at the right time. But it`s funny, some kind of running-gag! I think you should check that movie out. Because it makes you feel good when you leave the theater. All the characters are so different, odd but also so lovely and brilliantly played by the whole cast. And John Cusack is the PERFECT cast for the record store owner. You better not miss this!

While John Cusack turned in an excellent role, everybody seems to be forgetting the witch-like ex-girlfriends, including the best performance i have ever seen from Joan Cusack.And I thought Jack Black was just weird.

I give this movie a ten because for some reason, no matter what I'm doing or how I'm feeling I can put this movie on and instantly lose all care and worries in the world. When I watch this movie I feel comfortable and sublimely happy. Can't exactly explain why, but I just do. I think the acting is great by everyone, and the relationship that Rob, Dick and Barry share throughout the movie is brilliant. It's a story that proves that all you really need in the world are a few good friends, not the thousands you meet on myspace, and a good woman. In terms of its adaptation from the book, it's almost perfect. Aside from the obvious location change and some different character setups, for instance Dick in the book has long black hair and wears a leather jacket everywhere. But I have to give props to is the fact the dialogue between the book and the movie are incredibly similar. Some parts are actually exactly taken from the book.

316,apparentlysomeguy,I don't wanna hear old sad b_____d music,4,25 August 2019,"That's it. I searched for this movie because I kept hearing this Jack Black sound bite on the radio. This is a film I passed by at the time of release, but decided to rent it to say 'yes' I had seen it. It's OK in part. I felt like I was watching a cinematic, though darker version of How I Met Your Mother and can see this might have influenced the character development of that show or at least Mosby.Some viewers, will say it's not funny - I heartily chuckled in places. Tim Robbins, the love rival, gets too small a part, a sub-plot. How much of this feature was haphazardly left on the cutting-room floor? At no point are we informed as to why Cusack needs the girl and they have zero chemistry. Cusack wears the same hang-dog expression throughout, often whilst standing in the rain in his Brando leather jacket.I like music. I like indie music. So what. Yes I know of Belle and Sebastian, but this in no way makes the film more relatable and shouldn't alter anyone's appreciation of the proceedings. The problem I found was the uneven pace and loose structure. It's slow and feels like an almost 3h feature but I persisted. The last half hour feels rushed and seemingly attempting to squeeze in a large section of the book, with sparse dialog. I was enjoying it, but then it ran out of steam so noticeably that I scored it a 4 rather than a 7. It's overrated.",High Fidelity

As I watched this film, it occurred to me that I've had most of doubts, fears, thoughts, emotions and reactions as Rob.  I'll bet most guys, to a certain extent, have.  My wife hates when I say this, but the film is merely a glimpse into someone's life.  This journey, however, seemed to reach me not vicariously but introspectively.  OK, getting too deep...Jack Black is a scream!  Not a bad voice either (assuming it's really him...).  Joan Cusack is, as always, the perfect foil to John's character.

Perhaps one of the only things that might hurt ""High Fidelity"" --- and this is what pretty much has made up the few negative reviews I've read --- is that it thrives on the dark, self-centered and simply moronic side of people when it comes to ""being with"" others.  And I think that maybe it's too intelligently written for some people. But I'm betting that it's not you, because you're doing your homework by reading this little comment. It's a fine film, especially for those ""Say Anything"" fans out there (not to use that comparison to reduce or compartmentalize either film --- they're very different in their own rights), and one that I looking forward to owning.The ONLY problem I had --- look for the Evil Dead 2 reference.

322,davelee_99,Don't bother if you've read the book,6,6 April 2000,"Romances and comedies end with marriages.  Tragedies begin with a marriage. Or so the saying goes, more or less.And ""more or less"" is the overriding feel of ""High Fidelity.""  It's like the book, more or less.  It explores life and love, more or less.  It's okay, more or less, but pretty formulaic in the end.What Nick Hornby accomplished in his marvelously witty and fresh London-based book has been transmuted, more or less, into a distilled and sometimes lifeless form by John Cusack and his screenwriting cohorts.  It lacks the sharp personal speculations, the unconventional blend of story-telling and fantasy-telling, and the charming mock-period-piece feel of the book.  Championship Vinyl feels eerily out of place in contemporary Chicago, not unlike watching a Mini roll down Interstate 95.  The film-makers can drop as many references to Sam Raimee as they'd like, but this is no beauty in America.Alas, Mr. Cusack is also the weakest link amongst the cast -- which might be a bit understandable given the outstanding performances Todd Louiso and Jack Black offer.The movie does offer a few new subtle jokes to the tale.  The worst of these is the film's inability to take advantage of a Bruce Springsteen cameo; the best of these is an early mockery of Mr. Cusack's ""Bill Cosby"" approach to fashion -- followed by an appearance by Lisa Bonet.",High Fidelity

Cusack's interaction with the camera (the narration) is witty and amusing while the rest of the cast is right on target.  Jack Black is absolutely hilarious, especially if you are a music fan since you will have a better idea what he is poking fun at as well as the fact that I think everyone knows someone like him.

330,hard2xplain,good movie with great soundtrack,8,9 February 2002,"John Cusack stars as Rob, the owner of Championship Vinyl, which is a record store. It's where he and his two employees, Dick and Barry, hang out during the day. Rob has recently been dumped by his girlfriend, Laura while Dick and Barry seem never to have had one - prefering records over girls. On the surface the film is a romantic comedy of Rob getting back with Laura, but really at heart its a glimpse into the male pysche through a love of music. I'm sure we are all familiar (and may indeed see ourselves) with guys retreating into their world of music snobbery, attacking each others' ""top five"" music lists of all-time, etc!Involved in this project from the outset, and credited as co-producer and co-writer, Cusack spends much of the time doing speeches direct to camera, talking to us in his lonely apartment, on the way down the stairs, out on the street and all the way up to the shopfront - speeches taken almost word for word from Nick Hornby's book. Some might see this coming off a bit uneasy, a self-conconscious gimmick that director Stephen Frears could have done without, but I dont think it diminishes from the film much (actually as the film progresses and the action gets more complicated, this narration gets toned down a bit)As for the other main characters , Iben Hjelje shines as the very likeable Laura, Robs nice, accessible and down-to-to-earth girlfriend, Jack Black starring as Barry is simply superb and Todd Louiso is good as Dick - a character who fits the stereotype of a fan of relatively obscure (in the US at least) Glasgow indie band 'Belle and Sebastian'. Such musical 'in-jokes' are littered throughout the film - such as like the advert for some ""hip young gunslingers"" - a reference to a semi-famous advert placed for new writers in the New Musical Express in its heyday in the late 1970s and Punk and later New Wave was breaking. Its obvious the makers of this film care deeply about their music! If you are also a music fan, then there are parts of this film that you will simply love and the soundtrack is great also. However for those not so interested in music, the film may drag a bit and you wont be able to relate to the characters so well.However to me its definitely in my top 5 films of 1990s books",High Fidelity
331,Buddha1979,Romance Comedy from a Man's Point-of-View,8,8 September 2005,"Cusack delivers a lighthearted performance as Rob Gordon, an introspective self-loathing record store owner who is stuck riding a perpetual roller coaster of relationships and breakups. We are introduced to the character of Rob as he descends a downward spiral soon after his breakup with his latest girlfriend Laura (Hjejle). Being a quirky enthusiast of pop culture music, Cusack's character obsessively constructs a ""top-five"" list for almost every occasion in his life. The story unfolds with Rob embarking on a journey of self-realization. Using pop music as a soundtrack for the autobiography of his life, he recounts his track record with the multiple women from his past relationships, creating a ""top-five"" list of the worst breakups of all time. We are introduced to a variety of wonderful actors (Jack Black, Tod Louiso, Tim Robbins) and actresses (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusac) along his journey, and we see the character of Rob undergoing a natural metamorphosis of coming to terms with himself, casting aside his dead-end single life, and becoming a mature individual with realistic goals and direction.This movie is simply one of the most natural movies I've seen. It appears to have been easy to make, and it plays in such a manner that it is very easy to watch. The characters are extremely organic, very tangible and realistic. The movie's comedic aspects are well balanced by plot and character development and are almost entirely carried by the dialogue and the dynamic between the characters. Two sub-plots include Dick (Louiso) and Barry (Black), two socially misguided employees in Rob's record store whose extremes in personality bookend Rob's character and actually make him look more normal, and Laura's new fling, Ian (Robbins), an urban Zen-junkie that specializes in conflict resolution. To say the least, this movie is a satirical view of the male standpoint on love and romance, and many men may a find a piece of Rob Gordon within their own lives.SIMILAR MOVIES: Swingers (1996); Bottle Rocket (1996); Clerks (1994); Chasing Amy (1997); 24 Hour Party People (2002)",High Fidelity

Did they run out of money? This movie had the ability to be perfect, and the soundtrack is really good, don't get me wrong- I just think they had the opportunity to weave in some of the greatest songs of all time, and instead just put in some good ones. We Are the Champions by Queen was a really good touch though.Secondly, how about the softening of Nick Hornsby's book and the characters? They left out Rob refusing to buy some guy's entire record collection from an annoyed ex-wife, though probably a time issue. But they changed the end.

But overall, the plot was not too interesting, and I was wanting the movie to focus more on the record store, which it didn't.  The record store was of little focus in the whole spectrum of the movie.  So, sorry guys, but this film was not GREAT, but good.So can we leave it at that?For the Ryan Review Adam RyanLet me know any feedback any of you have about the movie! Thanks.",High Fidelity
342,andynicholas_uk,Could I be more enthusiastic?,10,10 January 2001,"Often movies of famous novels often fall short of the expectations of the reader. This, however, is undoubtedly not the case with this particular movie. As with the novel, we start with Rob, (John Cusack), discussing in monologue with the camera  about his top 5 breakups. This device works well, and gives the audience plenty of food for thought as well as laughs throughout the film, as he deals with his job, his employees and his own conscience.The basic premise of the plot is hardly stretching of the imagination, but that isn't the point. It is a phenomenal insight into the mind of modern man, (yes, I too identified with aspects of the lead!!!!!!!!). The script, despite transferring to Chicago from London, loses none of the humour and the wit of the book. Punchy and filled with laughs, you will never be looking at the watch. Indeed, many of the jokes are picked up on only at a second viewing. The acting is first class. The numerous cameos, (most notably from Tim Robbins), all dovetail nicely with the lead, with Cusack giving another reason why he is the best actor in Hollywood at the moment. But, above all else, Jack Black is incredible as Barry. Give the man an Oscar now! The direction is fluid, with the backdrops of the city mixed in for good measure. In fact, there is nothing not to dislike about this film.In an impressive film year, this beats all comers. See it now! If you have, see it again!",High Fidelity
343,gauntman,Even better than the book,9,4 April 2002,"I've never seen a movie that excels the book that it's based on. Except for this one. And i have to say that the book is really great. The Cast is so perfectly chosen, their acting is so fantastic that the characters you imagined reading the book seem pale and boring. Furthermore the main monologue in the movie really beats the #### out of it's written equivalent. Watch this flick, NOW!!! ;)",High Fidelity

345,Bulldog332,"I liked it, but...",7,16 May 2004,"I have to admit, I was very sceptical about the predicted success of this picture in the weeks before it's release.Nick Hornby - even though he's an Arsenal fan! - is an incredibly touching writer. He can put into words all the things that men, whether in a relationship or not, just cannot explain. When I first read the novel I was dumbstruck - he seemed to be describing the exact same emotions I went through in similar (if a little more acrimonious) breakups. It felt personal - he seemed to understand ME in a way no mate or other confidante could. I sang the writer's praises, recommended the book to all my friends...then heard that he had sold the film rights, agreeing for it to be set in the States. I was, to say the least, annoyed and a little...well, hurt. Betrayed, even. How could he cheapen what we had together - our mutual lack of understanding of women (London women, I hasten to add) - by doing this? I was indignant!The American film and TV industries have a knack of destroying anything decent to come out of our English screen market in recent years - 'Absolutely Fabulous' and 'As If' immediately spring to mind - but that's forgivable. However, changing the location of an essentially English, or dare I say 'London', novel is another thing entirely. However, it seems that to get a British film made these days, you have to either change the location to the States (like this one) or change the lead character into an American (The Beach - a fantastic book ruined to make a highly average film).It can be argued that basic human emotions, feelings and general reactions to the opposite sex are universal, pretty much the same the world over. But, even though I know it's fairly irrational and a little bit selfish, I wanted 'High Fidelity' to stay just between me and the writer. And if he wanted to sell the film rights, then I wanted it to stay between him and...England, I suppose. Irrationality is a family trait of mine.Given the fact that a huge percentage of British films that actually get made are funded by American investors, I suspect that this trend for 'Americanising' British scripts and novels will continue for the foreseeable future - unless the British Film Industry (and the British Film Council in particular) pulls it's finger out and invests in the considerable talents of Britain.",High Fidelity
346,HariElwingShaym,"John Cusak, what can you say, its gonna be good.",9,30 May 2004,"Well, this movie doesn't disapoint. You can see it any time and its good all over again. (Maybe give it a year in between, even two). Everyone's good in it, the lines are still funny and its heartwarming, what can you say, without taking itself very seriously. The moral to me? Yes, there is a lot of moralizing and deep thinking by our beloved Cusak as only he or maybe Kevin Spacey or Woody Allen does it. We have a cast of thousands, many almost unknown when this production first aired. I'd see it again just to see the fabulous Greta Garboesque (as in always hidden) Lisa Bonet in a treasured cameo. She was memorable indeed.Jack Black, a treasure. So many, many strong supporting roles. See it.",High Fidelity
347,loismustdie1982,The perfect romantic comedy,10,12 March 2004,"For any guy with relationship problems, any girl who wonders what the hell men are really thinking, or if you want to watch a Romantic Comedy that's actually romantic and funny, watch this film.Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is the epitome of the modern man.  He's sad, happy, lonely, funny, and a bit of a pig.  He's full of contradictions when it comes to relationships, including anger at his ex for sleeping with someone else the day after he does the same.  But that's actually why Rob is such a lovable character.  He has flaws, many of them.  He questions everything, and he has an obsessive compulsion with Top 5 lists.  He curses, he smokes, and he flies off the handle amid weird fantasies, but this lets the audience know he's a real person.  He's not some made-up romantic hero.  He's an anti-hero.  He's far from perfect, but we root for him, anyway.Barry, played by Jack Black, is a hilarious, fun-loving rocker.  This film forever establishes Jack Black as Hollywood's hard rock comedian.The role that surprised me most was Todd Louiso as Dick.  Dick is nervous, twitchy, but sensitive and brilliant.  He's basically what chick flicks try to characterize all men as, except that Dick is real, in that he has these qualities, but isn't some ravishing Mel Gibson model actor man.  Combine the three guys, and you have a combination of almost all men.The soundtrack (the backbone of this film about music and love) is simply amazing.  Unless you are the greatest expert of music history, I can guarantee that you haven't heard half of the songs on this soundtrack, but by the end of the film, you want to buy every record and song mentioned.High Fidelity is the perfect romantic comedy, and has quickly become one of my all time, Top 5, favorite movies.",High Fidelity
348,barry-jessiman,Smart; faithful to the book,9,13 July 2006,"This movie cemented my opinion of John Cusack as a favorite and an excellent actor who seemed to always pick great material (he hasn't been so picky lately). As with all really good movies all the characters were interests and well acted: Jack Black in an early Jack Black imitation; Iben Hjelje as the only truly together person in the whole film; Tim Robbins playing a parody and being hilariously assaulted in a great replay scene.I read the book afterwards and while the Cusack character isn't quite as likable in the book (he's just slightly more of a jerk at times), he's caught almost perfectly and the original sense of the book comes through: the transfer of the plot from England to the U.S. does no damage.Loved it.",High Fidelity
349,GeoPF,High Rock,8,23 April 2020,"Possibly the greatest rock movie ever. Fun, fast, irresistible, like a great song. Great writing.

350,lifeisnteverything,On my all-time Top Ten list,10,30 June 2005,"This is one of those movies that has the potential to change your life. Underneath the humor (of which there is a considerable amount) lies a truly sweet movie about an adult who still needs to grow up. Watching Rob, played charmingly and realistically by John Cusack, mature as he traces his life through music and various romantic entanglements is a joy.The central message of the movie seems to me to be that relationships take work. Well, duh, you may be saying. But this film illuminates that point, showing each of Rob's formative (or, as he puts it, ""All-Time, Desert-Island Top Five"") relationships, why they went wrong, and, to a certain degree, how they could have gone right.Rob's most important relationship is with music--it's his true love, and the film treats it as a character. Given the choice between his girlfriend and his record collection, the viewer is left with no doubt which Rob would choose--music, hands down. This disregard for human feelings that Rob shows throughout much of the movie proves something else: as much as we may like him, Rob's kind of a jerk. It is a testament to the heart of this film, the strength of the story, and the talent of its large, varied cast that ""High Fidelity"" emerged a thoughtful, funny movie, rather than an annoying pity-party about its main character.I recommend this movie to everyone.",High Fidelity
351,freymaroto,"In deed, GREAT MOVIE",10,16 February 2006,"Why is this movie great???, well it certainly had a potential, and they took advantage from it. It takes place in a Record store but it is really the story of Rob struggling with the loss of his love Laura. i t combines a love story of rejection with great music, great bands are either on the soundtrack or at least mentioned with great eloquence, jokes about music, about human feelings are beautifully portrayed. Characters, not only Jack Black's or John Cusack's, but for example Catherine Zeta Jones' make a great statement of different human qualities, and different stages of different relationships in love life that were a big deal for Rob, and you can really easily get identified. It combines Love, Humor and rock and roll in a great way, if you like those... you have to watch it.",High Fidelity

I laughed my head off all over again.  The moment I heard ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" in the first scene I was hooked.I am a huge fan of the book and must admit I was originally very disappointed in the change of location from London to Chicago (for various reasons) but for the past year I kept saying if anyone can pull this off it is John Cusack.  I cannot imagine anyone else in this part.  Not only John, a great cast all around.Great soundtrack too, and that poster .... brilliant!",High Fidelity
353,billnted,A Guy Romantic Comedy that Rocks,9,2 April 2000,"This film that lives up to Nick Hornby's brilliant, hilarious, inspired book.  Although squeezing the book down to a couple of hours left a few things not quite fleshed out.This is a guy movie about relationships, a romantic comedy with substance. Rob (John Cusak) relates to his record store employees, and the world, through his snobby opinions about  rock n roll and much else.  In the record store, they're always making up top 5 lists about everything.  He has that most common of guy addictions: he's an opinion-aholic: he's right and everyone else is wrong.  Which doesn't endear him to his live-in girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) though she appreciates his other qualities.
She moves out, moves in with another guy, and Rob freaks, becomes the ex-boyfriend from heck.  It takes him a while to figure out that opinions aren't everything, and that it is possible to love someone who has what he thinks is a lame CD collection, and that they get along better without that opinion stuff in the way.  As a guy, formerly much more opinionated myself, I can relate.Cusack brings the novels interior monologues to the screen by directly addressing the camera, as in ""Ferris Buehler's Day Off.""  In lesser hands this would seem too contrived, but he manages to make it believable, even natural.John's sister Joan has a nice supporting role, not too many minutes of screen time, but well done.  Iben Hjejle, the Danish actress, doesn't quite sound like a Chicagoan (though I wouln't have guessed she was Danish), but does a good job in a role that's not nearly as flashy as John Cusack's. Lots of cameos: Tim Robbins as the new boyfriend is the funniest.While I was a little disappointed that the film changes the location from London to Chicago, but hey, I live in Chicago, and they did a nice job of revealing the city, not using the stock shots, shooting in neighborhoods that tourists seldom visit, full of realistic touches in the script that someone who grew up in the Windy City like John Cusack (who also co-wrote) would know.So, definitely catch this flick.  Read the book first, or afterwards, and see what you think.""High Fidelity"" is on my top 5 list for the year.",High Fidelity
354,rosie-54,"So enjoyable, but terrible camera work",9,8 July 2000,"I just saw High Fidelity and have read several reviews.  I also read the book. Although much of the music referred to in the book and in the movie is unknown to me (I was raising children in the 60's and 70's), I loved the characters in the book and in the movie.  The displacement of the locale from London to Chicago was well done and all the actors were well chosen. The beef I have about this movie is the camera work!  I haven't read a review that complained about chins being cut off, cameras showing up from the top of the screen, and so on.  It really bothered me and distracted from the enjoyment of the film.  Anyone out there agree with me?",High Fidelity
355,Desperate Icon,The Best Of The Year,10,24 August 2000,"In a rare occurrence of the film actually living up to the novel (and in some ways surpassing it), 'High Fidelity' tells the story of Rob Gordon (John Cusack, excellent as always), a record store owner only barely hanging onto the frayed ends of his life - his record store struggles under the supervision of two hapless sales assistants (Jack Black and Todd Louiso, who elevate the film to a whole new level), and his girlfriend is leaving him, which causes him to reassess his top 5 failed relationships.With Tim Robbins giving a minor role everything he's got, and the most unexpectedly funny dream sequences, 'High Fidelity' is my pick for the most original film of the year, if not indeed the best.I was particularly troubled to see in the imdb voting for this film that several people have given this film 1 or 2 out of ten. I am of the opinion that you really should know a little bit about a film before you go to see it. It bothers me that someone could vote this film so poorly when it is clearly such a success...perhaps they had it confused with some boorish teen comedy.'High Fidelity' is a fantastic example of the romantic comedy genre; unpredictable and edgy, believable characterisation and intriguing narrative structure. See this film!",High Fidelity
356,Momer,Really loved it!,10,3 October 2003,"I have read the book. Usually films made from books are a letdown, but this is maybe the only one I know that is better than the book!

357,Arrakis2,Top five reasons to see High Fidelity,9,31 March 2000,"Finally a romantic comedy that takes the guys' point of view.  Not with the intent to bash women or glorify men but to show the ugly truth behind our mindless, gutless, and sometimes idiotic reasons for doing the things we do. Top five reasons to see this film:1) superb acting by the lead and supporting cast 2) novel way (to me) of telling a romantic story 3) funny, witty, wily 4) great tunes 5) Bruce Springsteen makes a cameo",High Fidelity
358,sKutir,Very enjoyable film...,9,2 April 2000,"Initially I was worried about this movie adaptation of a novel I really liked, because they relocated it from London to the U.S. -- but fortunately, they moved it to a gritty Chicago neighborhood and not some sun-blessed upper-class California zip code. Also, they kept the authenticity of the music store geeks and their propeital snobbery. It actually carries over very well, and I expect even Nick Hornby will find it works as well in Chicago as it does in London. It maintains the convivial, confessional, and unpretentiousness of the book. The cast is very good. A couple of scenes really killed me. I think a lot of people will see this movie and say, ""I know that guy!"" or ""This is my biography!",High Fidelity
359,cud1,Very Funny,8,30 March 2000,"A great funny movie.  I was rolling on the ground.  This movie is a mix between Empire Records and Jerry Maguire.  Cusak is great, and so are the Record Store employees. Some very good cameos, in the Movie and Catherine Zeta Jones is so Hot.",High Fidelity

One of his top three movies in my book.",High Fidelity

This is a great movie because it is REAL.  I'm sitting there identifying with his actions.  When he looks out the store to see the shy guy  and his newfound love, I can FEEL the emotions in Rob's mind. I KNOW what he was thinking without him even having to say it.Cusack is brilliant in this movie, as is the rest of the cast.  Great movie.Oh, and while Rob is reminiscing about he and Laura hearing Ian have sex in the apartment above them, check out the title on Laura's book in the flashback.  ""Love Thy Neighbor"".  Great touch.",High Fidelity
363,sidemoss,Excellent film,9,21 December 2000,"Any movie in which John Cusack gets some free reign is going to be great. He really understands our generation.  This is a film with the know-it-all characters that we truly know.  The music that they love is the music we love.  And when they rip on it, we understand why. High Fidelity represents a generation.  Even though, you hate his character, Rob is still cool.  Maybe it is just his whole list mentality.  But, we are a generation of media references. This also helped me to understand the mentality behind record store owners and how they can live as both owner and connoisseur.  They basically can't. But, the frustration is real. John Cusack has really proven himself even though he did Better Off Dead.",High Fidelity
364,The Reel Deal,A Modern Day Alfie?,9,2 August 2000,"I knew that I would like this movie even before I bought the tickets.  I mean starring John Cusack, directed by Stephen Frears (My Beautiful Laundrette, The Grifters), co-produced by D.V. DeVincentis (Grosse Point Blank) and based on a Nick Hornby Novel.  An absolute recipe for success. And then there is the film and I'm glad to say that it is, without doubt, far greater than the sum of its parts.  If characterisation is important to you then don't miss this movie.  Each character is beautifully developed over the course of this film and by the end they all  despite their many flaws  seem like old and loved friends.  As for the films examination of the human condition then you merely have to look at the list of names above and in turn look at their previous outings to understand why and how this film has no problem in delivering an exceptional story.  My first thoughts on leaving the cinema was that this is a modern day Alfie' and this I think is a pretty fair tribute.  Also anyone who grew up in the eighties will love the retro feel  I know I did.  Don't miss this movie.",High Fidelity
365,isca45,What a GREAT movie,9,11 July 2000,"I found this movie highly entertaining and extremely hilarious.  Normally, I don't like to watch a movie twice in a short span of time... and definitely not at the movie theater (I'm a cheapskate).  But, in this movie's case, I made an exception.  John Cusak is awesome in this role.  The top five lists that he comes up with are just great.  Barry and Dick are extremely hilarious.  They remind me so much of people that I know.  Of course, to get some of this movie, you have to have either been married or lived with a woman.  That is the only way that you can understand Rob's frustration with his relationships.  This movie is definitely a MUST SEE, and this summer, there aren't too many movies out there that I would recommend as such.  I give it 9 1/2 stars outta 10.",High Fidelity
366,M-Blank,Cusack at his Best,9,3 April 2000,"I had been anticipating the release of this movie for some time and I was not disappointed.  Although I have never read the Nick Hornby novel, I was really impressed with this movie.  I have been a Cusack fan for a very long time and this was one of his best performances ever.  I loved the way his character 'Rob Gordon' was talking to the camera and letting the movie-goer journey through his emotional state.  He is one of the few actors in Hollywood who could have pulled it off.  His facial expressions and emotions were very real and by the end of the movie you really got a sense of the characters persona.  The supporting cast did a marvelous job, especially Jack Black and Tim Robbins. This movie bought back so many fond memories of those John Cusack 80's classics.  It was like watching Lloyd Dobler (Say Anything), Lane Meyer (Better Off Dead) and Walter Gibson (The Sure Thing) grow up and tackle ""grown up"" problems.  The setting was great, Cusack was born and raised in Chicago and he knew exactly where to film it.  The Soundtrack is also amazing and Cusack personally picked out many of the tracks for the movie.  He also co-wrote the screenplay. I hope that this film finally gets Cusack the recognition he so richly deserves.  Unlike other 80's teen actors who have faded to obscurity, Cusack will be around for a long time.  In my opinion he is the greatest actor of his generation. My Rating: 9/10",High Fidelity
367,caliban-25,Utterly brilliant,9,23 July 2000,"A wonderful book has been made into a wonderful film. Cusack hits the spot exactly: He looks, talks and acts like Hornby's hero. Definitely a must-see for any man below 40 and above 25 -- women, on the other hand, don't seem to like the movie as much. Don't know why. But that doesn't matter: It wasn't made for them.

368,Wielgosz,The most accurate portrayal of 'geekness' that I've seen...,10,17 April 2000,"...and I don't mean 'geekness' in a bad light, but rather the borderline obsessive nature that all of us has about something, whether it be film, or music, or ten year old, mint-in-the-box action figures.  It becomes our secondary vocabulary, our means of assessing others. (As Cusack's character Rob Gordon says - ""It's about what YOU like, not about what you ARE like...""And yes, the bad stuff is there too.  The elitist nature of the knowledgeable versus the neophytes, and the, at times, VERY compulsive nature of the hobby, to the point where it begins to overshadow everything else.John Cusack nails the part of walking the line between being a bitter schmuck and someone you still feel worthy of rooting for.  Jack Black's character reminds me so much of many of my friends, quick to judge, elitist, and grating at times, but someone you still feel compelled to keep around.And the character of Rob Gordon, scarily enough, is the closest thing I've seen to myself in film.  And yet there's still hope for him at the end. For this alone, the movie deserves an 7.  But every other element, the pacing, the look and feel, the consistent breaking of the fourth wall, is so polished that the rating easily, easily goes to a '10'.",High Fidelity
369,flickwho,Why Jack Black is god,10,27 April 2000,"If I were to voice any objection about this movie, it would be that they replace Elvis Costello with Bruce Springsteen and there's no sign of the song that lent its name to the title of the movie. All that aside, High Fidelity is pure joy. You'd have to have the old stickeroo pretty far up your whatzit to not enjoy this movie. Cusack is great, of course, Cusack is my on screen counterpart, as ever (at least I'd like to think so) but the greatest pleasure I took in this move all came from JB. I'm talkin' bout the D, you who know, know what I'm talking about. I went to see this flick with my girlfriend and I started laughing uncontrollably the moment he came on screen. My date insisted that it wasn't funny yet. Needless to say, we're not together anymore. Back to Jack. Jack Black is one of the funniest guys around and this movie gave him free reign to prove it.

But if you do know a lot about music, this movie is perfect.  Plus, it's hilarious.  In the sequence in the record store with Ian, I laughed harder than I ever had at a movie.  The record store clerks are so great, Todd and Jack play off of each other so well.  And (drumroll please...) John Cusack.  He is such an awesome actor.

I picked up a copy of the book at the local library and found that it did follow the movie but the location of the book was London not the States.

Nick Hornby's novel is a marvellous and truthful tale of what it's like to be a man in the 20th/21st century. John Cusack's Rob Gordon is hardly recognizable as the same character. Admittedly the Americanisation doesn't work, but it isn't just geographical transition from North London to Chicago that causes me so many frustrations it John Cusack's complete lack of identification with the character he plays. Throughout the film it's unignorably evident that he's playing a role and it is impossible to believe that he IS that character.I once read an article which referred to John Cusack as one of the most gifted actor's of his generation.

The soundtrack is incredible, John Cusack talking to the camera is brilliant, the whole thing is just wonderful, you don't see films like this just 14 years later.As you can see, I'm not very good at reviews but I wanted to share my many teeny thoughts about how incredible this film is :)",High Fidelity
377,absurdity101,An excellent film.,10,14 February 2002,"High Fidelity is, for me at least, one of those movies that I don't mind watching again and again. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it definately has a lot within it that I can relate to, as well as one of the best soundtracks to grace a film, and some excellent acting. The only questionable casting choice in my opinion was Iben Hjejle as the long-suffering girlfriend of John Cusacks' Rob Gordon. I really have no idea why she was cast, as it seems like she's reading her lines from cue cards throughout the entire movie. I can't decide who I want to smack more, Hjejle herself, or Victoria Thomas who obviously thought she'd be a good choice. Thankfully, an otherwise stellar cast manages to bring this movie to life. I think this is one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen on relationships and the male psyche in regards to women. I thought nearly every aspect of the movie was done extremely well, and I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a good movie that will actually make you think a little.",High Fidelity
378,bjorno,Feelgooder for the moment!,7,13 April 2002,"This one actually made me feel good, which was quite a scary thing! And that's just what this film is; A feel-gooder! You'll enjoy it all through the two hours it lasts, but I'm afraid it'll run right off you afterwards. Not a big thinking movie though some immature young men like myself might be able to learn something of it. But we never do, so what's really the point?",High Fidelity
379,dean-613-217228,Man has no social skills and doesn't understand why his relationships bomb,1,1 June 2010,"I only lasted 20 minutes before changing the channel. This was billed as a comedy but there was nothing even mildly amusing in the first 20 minutes. Most of it was painful to watch.I tuned in because I really like John Cusack, but instead of finding the charming, self-effacing man I have enjoyed in other movies, I was stuck with a man who was so busy complaining about his life, he had no ability to fully function. Perhaps you have to be male and under 30 years old to appreciate this kind of self involved, whiny, maudlin character study. I like characters WITH character, like Cusack's role in Must Love Dogs. This was simply a dog of a movie, and that's unfair to dogs.",High Fidelity
380,bigjoebrown,Good intelligent fun!,9,30 June 2003,"Acting was superb.  John Cusack, as always, was great as Rob, the record-store owner.  Jack Black was awesome--I was in stitches every time he was on screen.  The music was great and Jack Black and the other guy who works with him at the record store had the snob-hipster I-know-everything-about-music-and-you-don't thing down so well.  This is a must-see!",High Fidelity

John Cusack, who I regard as the modern Jack Lemmon, is one of the few who can play an absolute a**hole and make him likeable, simply by being as honest as he can be about himself. And Iben Hjejle plays one of the most realistic love interests ever. I'd love to have seen Myrna Loy try her on. Great smile.",High Fidelity
383,fbgillispie,Something special,9,4 November 2020,"It's not common when a movie sticks with me the way this one did. I honestly could not tell you why on earth I liked this movie as much as I did. Probably because it felt so real. It didn't have any of the cliche romantic comedy tropes that I expected. It was, plain and simple, a good movie. John Cusack did an amazing job, making you walk the thin line of loving him to hating him. And the ending is believable. It's not that perfect storybook ending that would never happen, it's something real, and will make me smile every time I watch this movie. High Fidelity is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It's special.",High Fidelity
384,HomesickAtSpacecamp18,My Favourite Film Of All Time!,10,2 July 2007,"This is my favourite film of all time for 3 main reasons: 1. John Cusack is the best and most underrated actor of his generation and this is his best film. 2. It's adapted from Nick Hornby's book, which is another favourite of mine and it is brilliantly funny. And finally 3. This is a movie about music, my other love and so how could I not love it....High Fidelity is funny, honest and a refreshing tale of love and loss from a male perspective. Cusack shines but so do all involved especially Jack Black who, though I have never liked, almost steals the show here. The soundtrack rocks, the script is wicked and the overall piece is ace. A+.",High Fidelity
385,BC Gronk,Boring!,4,2 April 2000,"Unfortunately this is just another in a long line of comedies where all the funny parts are shown in the thirty second commercial seen on TV.  I am a fan of John Cusack but found his conversations with the audience, which made up about half of the film, quite tedious.  I wish I had waited for the rental.  That way I could have fallen asleep on my relatively comfortable couch rather than in the theater.",High Fidelity
386,gatsby-3,A great book set in Chicago,10,21 March 2000,"I read High Fidelity years and years ago, in one sitting, actually and it has since been my favorite book written in the last couple decades.  So, you can imagine, when I heard the movie was coming out last summer, I was a little nervous.Alright, I was a lot nervous.  I like John Cusack a lot, but his desire to set this movie in Chicago made me think he didn't care about the book like I did.  Well, I was wrong.This movie is awesome.  The acting is excellent, especially from the three main characters: our friends in the record store.  My favorite character in the book is my favorite in the movie, the obnoxious Barry(played by Jack Black).  He is horribly uncaring, but funny, musically knowledgeable but snobbish.Most people will be able to identify with these characters whether they had read this book or not, but for those folks who have read the book, the movie is still a pleasure.  It contains all the elements of the original: top 5 lists, a great love story and the hilarious pain of past relationships.Enjoy!",High Fidelity
387,likefilm,"Great movie, if you don't mind very strong language",7,3 April 2000,"John Cusack has consistently turned in understated, very funny, and sharply insightful comic performances.  It's great to see him offer cynical truths that force us to reflect on some of our own funny brokenness.  This movie is full of this kind of bleakly offered, yet amusing reflection.High Fidelity is also very funny in many other ways, and though the conclusion is somewhat routine, the journey is anything but.  And the journey is what we're here for anyway, isn't it?Unfortunately though, there is constant profanity, strong sex talk and some relatively frantic (though funny) sexual imagery and this keeps me from recommending it for anyone who might be offended by this.
I wish Cusack and his co-writers, as well as director Frears would have contented themselves with less vulgarity (in both language and imagery).  I think it would have been just as funny and insightful.",High Fidelity
388,DrSpatch,"Best movie in a long time, better than American Beauty",10,30 June 2000,"Great movies usually either involve ordinary people in extraordinary situations or extraordinary people in ordinary situations. This John Cusack film opens your eyes to the fact that there are no ordinary people. ""High Fidelity"" follows the lovelorn Rob, as he struggles to regain the affection of Laura while writing countless top five lists. Absolutely hilarious while thought-provoking, this movie is my pick for best of the year.",High Fidelity
389,Dave-490,GenX laughs at itself,6,4 April 2000,Rob (John Cusack) is a confirmed Gen X vinyl record store owner too insecure to do much with his life but what seems to meet his immediate selfish needs. As a result he hasn't much of a life and women leave him or disappoint him in droves.  As he gradually talks his way toward understanding where he is screwing up he can get a bit tiresome but he is also funny as he alternates between honesty and self-pity.  His two record store employees hilariously steal whatever scene they are in.  Worth seeing if Gen-X and their problems intrigue you.,High Fidelity
390,TinnyPhilly,"Thank You, John Cusack!",9,2 April 2000,"John and his writing partners have done a wonderful job crafting a great movie from an entertaining book.  The move from London to Chicago works out well, though initially I was a little put-off by the idea.I first remember seeing John Cusack as Anthony Michael Hall's geek friend in ""Sixteen Candles"", arranging for a showing of Molly Ringwald's underwear in the boy's room during a school dance.  You can imagine his character in this movie, Rob, having that history.The record store denizens (employees and customers) are dead on; I used to spend many an hour skulking through cement-walled record stores searching for that elusive Smith's 12-inch single with James Dean on the cover. These record-store snobs just don't get it--they break down life into top five lists, without really participating in life at all.  The character Rob, played by John Cusack, goes from relationship to relationship, never considering the girlfriend's point of view.  In fact, his fidelity isn't high at all; he can't commit to anyone.  Even at the end of the movie, when he has had an epiphany of sorts, you know that he still has far to go before he can deal with the reality of relationships.  I think it pretty impressive that an American movie can end with this sort of ambivalence; usually characters do such an about-face by the end of a story-line that it becomes totally unbelievable.  But Rob can only manage to change his life little by little, just like the rest of us poor slobs.John Cusack is at his best in these small, character-driven films.  Please God, don't let him do another ""Con-Air"" again; I'll even sacrifice my nearly mint-condition 1980 copy of O.M.D.'s Enola Gay, pressed in England, if that will help!",High Fidelity
391,NeoDroog,The ultimate geek movie.,8,31 March 2000,"I'm sure the people sitting around me when I saw this movie were completely exasperated.  I'd grab the shoulder of the person next to me.  ""Did you see that?  Did you see that???""  Bauhaus t-shirts and KMFDM magnets.  Vegan and The Vandals.  The critics are talking about the movie dialogue being chock full of pop culture and underground music; the reason they noticed the dialogue so much was that they weren't actually into the stuff the characters were talking about.  True obscure pop culture freaks (people who had actually heard of Jesus and the Mary Chain instead of a movie critic thinking that would be a clever name for a band) were busy noticing the scenery.  Both are extremely enjoyable; I haven't mentioned until now that High Fidelity is a really great movie.  It's fun and funny, serious in between, and never ever boring.  John Cusack's melloncollie is right on target and wonderful to watch.  And while the scenery is there, it's never better to watch than the movie itself.  High Fidelity is, in short, the geek's dream movie.  The dialogue is overflowing with references to old school punk (how Green Day is influenced at all by Stiff Little Fingers I'll never know, but hey...) and eighties power pop, all the while commenting on human nature when one is alone, in love, and part of a whole.  The characters are extremely likable and lively.  The soundtrack is jammin. Just... a good movie.  See it.  Enjoy it.  Cheer for the Wax Trax t-shirt.",High Fidelity
392,Bernard-13,enjoyable but not brilliant,7,14 September 2000,"High fidelity is an enjoyable comedy but not much more than that. While the first half is funny due to all the things that go wrong to the main character, the second half of the film doesn't really do much for me.I liked Tim Robbins' performance, but the fact that Laura's new boyfriend would be a jerk was predictable.The film was fun to watch, but a place in the top 250 is ridiculous.",High Fidelity
393,Harp-2,Better than the book,10,2 April 2000,"Read the book several years ago, don't remember being as impressed with the book as the movie.  This movie was grrrrreat!  Transferred from London to Chicago better than expected.  The guys in the record store are hilarious, I knew them.  I was them?  I wish.John Cussack rocks, the story works.  Practically everyone in this flick is likeable, it is funnier than hell.  Every time Rob walks into his apartment it takes me back to my college days (walls of records). Nick Hornby is a clever writer, this is a clever movie, life is good, go see it!",High Fidelity
394,rogue1-3,Advanced Cusack Humor 601,8,21 March 2000,"So you liked Grosse Pointe Blank, you think you're hip to the dry, sarcastic, often morbid wit of John Cusack.  You even got a kick out of Pushing Tin, watching him spiral into an ocean of self-analysis and despair as he tries desperately to deconstruct then reassemble his relationships. Now you're ready for the big leagues.High Fidelity lacks both the gunslinging fun of Blank and the aerobatic insanity of Tin, replacing them with a total omnibus on the male point of view on women.  This is told through narration, both first and third person, as well as a sizeable chunk of flashback time.  The jokes are often quick, said low, not waiting for a laugh.  The kind of humor only some people really get, and the rest of the theater takes the cue to laugh along.  I was rolling in the aisles.High Fidelity is not a date movie, unless guys want their girlfriends asking them a lot of difficult questions afterwards.  Though not many of us obsess to the incredible lengths Cusack's character takes us, the issues and questions he raises are all too real.  The movie lacks any kind of Seinfeld quality, for although it deals with mountains of minor details, the viewer always feels their sense of importance in the larger picture of life.In summary: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hope it doesn't inspire any awkward questions from your date...",High Fidelity
395,CharlesGust,great movie; are we miserable because of the movies we see?,9,3 January 2001,"Are we miserable because of the movies we see, or do we see those movies because we are miserable?This is definitely a DVD to own.I read a lot of the comments here, and especially cracked up at the person who walked out half way through and wondered why Rob didn't ""bitch slap"" his obnoxious employee.  Hey, it's in there - you missed it.Okay, this movie is like a dose of Gertrude Stein - you get a layer of an emotion, and then another way gets brushed on, and it *IS* more about setting a mood and defining characters than telling a linear story.  But, if all you have a taste for is linear stories, you would find this movie a little frustrating.  Like, ""the characters don't DO ANYTHING"" - they don't take dramatic action.  They kind of live day by day.Yes, this is a chick flick for guys.  A guy movie without gratuitous violence or gratuitous nudity (although tiny bits of both).Is it merely a remake of Annie Hall (with hipper music)?  I'd say it's a deeper exploration into the breakdown of the male psyche during the examination of a string of failed relationships, which only part of Annie Hall was about.  Annie Hall actually had a little about Annie Hall.  I felt Laura really remained an enigma to Rob - we don't get to see inside her head, but we get to really see inside his head.  Rob wants answers, and Laura doesn't give them.That this movie works to build sympathy for flawed characters (both Laura and Rob) is one of the charming aspects.  You are witnessing people in their own self-absorption, which doesn't everybody have at some point in their life?Here are my Top 5 reasons for purchasing the DVD:1. You want the bonus deleted scenes, I think there's 9.  I feel 2-3 are throwaway's, 2 were probably cut because they talked down to the audience, and 1 was probably cut because it reveals too much of what's in Laura's head.  But, the rest are gold - should have been in the movie.  It's like I want to edit them back in.  Make my own ""compilation movie"".2. You want to turn on the subtitles at some point.  It's the quickest way to catch the overlap between the dialog going on and the music/lyrics playing in the background.3. Nice to have Frears and Cusacks interviews in the Bonus material.4. Okay, this is a reason the DVD sucks: You have to Chapter skip previews for ""Mission to Mars"", ""Deuce Bigalow"" and ""Scream"" before the DVD Title page shows up.  I think it's lame to put anything before the Title on a DVD.5. You want to watch it again...I didn't see this movie in the theater because I thought I had to be qualified to understand obscure musical references and I thought it was completely about tracking down former girlfriends without the injection of the hilariously dysfunctional system of the three folks working at the record store.I loved this movie; it was a riot.  But, it's a 9/10 because near the ending it really felt a little like ""divine plot device intervention"".  But, not your typical pat Hollywood ending - that's probably why this movie runs a little longer.  You look at your watch, you THINK it's over...",High Fidelity
396,noor-2,Good Cusack,8,29 July 2000,"Excellent adaption of Nick Hornby's novel where Cusack plays Rob Gordon a second hand record store owner who recalls his past loves as his present one is leaving while also assessing his whole life in general. If your a John Cusack fan great pleasure is provided by the flashback sequences where Rob recalls his Top Five break ups. We see Cusack in 80's garb and matching hairdo bringing back memories of his early teen classics such as ""The Sure Thing"" and ""Say Anything"". However if your a fan you may also be disappointed that Cusack keeps on returning to this persona and doesn't try to concentrate on becoming a ""star"" for want of a better word, just look at his performances in ""The Grifters"" and ""City Hall"" and you may know what I mean. Anyway back to this movie, Rob's co-workers played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso are great especially Louiso who is so geeky but at the same time very funny and likeable. The women (even though their roles are largely secondary) are great especially Iben Hjejle and Lisa Bonet and Frears direction is assured and Cusack is Cusack, and no one does it better.",High Fidelity
397,Scrnwrt1,The first great film of 2000 - a top 5 fave!,10,11 April 2000,"Being a John Cusack fan to begin with, I went into HIGH FIDELITY expecting a good John Cusack flick, but hardly one with much depth or social significance.  Upon leaving the theatre, I was dumbfounded by what I'd just seen.  After losing a night's worth of sleep thinking about the movie, I concluded that in my estimation it was one of the greatest true-to-life character studies of all time.HIGH FIDELITY's excellence begins with the amazing cast of talent, starting at the top with John Cusack.  Cusack was not an actor portraying Rob Gordon, he WAS Rob Gordon.  His range was fully explored in this film, from outstanding comedic timing on par with some of the greats, to a hidden sensitivity and vulnerability in relationships to which so many of us can relate.  Not to mention the perfect execution of his monologues to the audience.And then the list of wonderful performances runs down the list from Jack Black and Todd Louiso, to Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack and alas Tim Robbins.  Though not a stand out, Iben Hjejle was convincing as a woman who would be worth falling in love with.  There was not a single character in this film that, at one point or another in our lives, we have not met ourselves.The writing is superb and the soundtrack, as expected, is fantastic.  A beautifully shot film as well, it's worth paying to see it on the big screen.  It's a bit of a travesty that so many people are missing out on seeing this movie - bringing it in at a very modest 8th on the box office top ten - but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not worth your eight bucks.  Stephen Frears and John Cusack have turned out an Oscar worthy film.  10 / 10  (or, #1 on the top 5 list)",High Fidelity
398,Mervius-2,Hated it!,2,30 March 2000,"I haven't seen such pretentious hooey in a while.  Pseudo-hip, unenlightening, and downright dull.  John Cusack, who I don't mind as an actor/performer in general, totally curls up into his Cusack shell with this one, being nothing but himself on the screen (my, what a challenge).  Too many personalities, too many cameos, but no real characters.  Two-thirds of the way through this sneak preview, I overheard someone say, ""This is stupid.""  And soon people were walking out.  Around this time, Cusack yells, ""When will it end?!""  My thoughts exactly, Johnny.",High Fidelity
399,Ladyhawke,Relationship Honesty (for a change),8,10 April 2000,"The best thing about this movie, apart from the always enjoyable pairing of John and Joan Cusack is that it portrays a much more honest view of modern relationships then the average film. It shows that people can carry baggage from adolescent events and if they're not understood then they can cause problems in later life. Rob Gordon is a refreshingly cynical character who manages to maintain his romanticism, and his girlfriend, Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, is a delightfully true character who doesn't just melt and fall back into Rob's arms where other female romantic leads would have. Though it may appear to be a 'typical' romantic comedy from the trailers I say give this one a chance, it is multi faceted and if you don't relate to it on one or more levels then I'd say you're one of the lucky few who's never had your heart broken without understanding why. In which case I'm not sure if I am jealous of you or sad for you.",High Fidelity
400,Doctor A.D.,Should Have Gone Straight To Comedy Central,5,4 April 2000,"While it was a bit of a lukewarm surprise to actually hear four Drag City recording artists in the movie (note to the unaware: the ""demo tape"" that the skate punks made was actually real music by a real life established band- Royal Trux- which was a totally unrealistic point in the movie, esp. since the lead singer heard on the ""demo tape"" happens to be a female), I as a non-fictional music enthusiast felt inadequately stereotyped and somewhat patronized. High Fidelity misses the point in portraying record nerds the same way Hollywood usually misses the point in portraying christians: you can't can't get the real humor and drama out of a picture unless you can fully  comprehend the people you are depicting and convince THEM to believe in your story. I was not convinced. This movie did little for me except serve as a strong reminder as to why I prefer mail order to physical record stores: most people who work in record stores are annoying. Beyond that, I thought the acting was standard and the story was completely boring. Buy the soundtrack and wait for the video if you really think you absolutely must suffer through this.",High Fidelity
401,obsessiv,Excellent adaptation of Hornby's book.,10,10 April 2000,"While most movies that have been adapted from books fall flat (Stephen King's ""The Stand"" comes to mind), ""High Fidelity"" was a brilliant effort. I can't recall seeing any other movie adaptation that followed its literary counterpart so closely. There were a few minor differences, additions and omissions, but all-in-all, the cast might have been reading the script straight from the book.Cusack plays Rob Gordon with just the right amount of bitterness and low expectation. Jack Black plays Barry *perfectly*, every bit as annoying as the book character was. Todd Louiso as Dick, the introverted record geek, was also perfect, particularly in the succession of scenes when Ian (Tim Robbins) is in the record shop.10 out of 10 for style, plus several million for everything else.",High Fidelity

Could be Say Anything 2",9,21 March 2000,"This movie is a MUST for those who came to regard Cusack as an idol through Better Off Dead, The Sure Thing, and Say Anything.  Cusack is superb in walking the line between cool-guy-you-root-for and far-from-a-saint, and Jack Black finally comes into a role that people will remember him for. The film sometimes feels like it wants to end sooner than it does, but then starts new scenes with vigor.  Only complaint:  you never quite see Cusack and Iben Hjejile really click at any point, causing one to wonder what the attraction was in the first place.  Very high audience response at the preview I attended. A very well-made motion-picture that I hope audiences don't ignore.",High Fidelity

But I feared that the film treatment would butcher the book and that I'd be disappointed. Not so. I was very pleased. The directing and acting was spookily faithful to the book. This is a very human story of one man's confusion as he tries to define and then find and then hold onto true love. One of the lessons he learns is that self-acceptance has to come first. Go see it; you won't be disappointed unless perhaps you're a hung-up perfectionist.",High Fidelity

Not the belly-aching laugh that the book was from beginning to end but a very entertaining watch nevertheless. The cast, notably John Cusack, were excellent. However, the bleeding heart required from Rob's character in the first half of the film to hone the comedy was missing, which I felt deadened the story a little. All in all, well worth the money.",High Fidelity

412,acm72,An English Review,8,31 May 2000,"For those of you who are concerned that Nick Hornby's comic novel would lose out by being moved to the US, fear no more. This film is right at home in the suburbs of Chicago, and having said that it could equally have been set anywhere in the UK or US and it would have still held good. The only major thing that has been changed is the music, and enough effort has been put into updating the selections to make any differences immaterial. The central premise, or premises, of Championship Vinyl is an example of second hand record shops the world over, and the types of music obsessed occupants equally reflect those that staff them. John Cusack is superb as the lead Rob, but the support, and it is some support (Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and others), all give excellent comic performances. I'm sure that other comments have covered the rest of the film, but I just wanted to reassure you all that the book has been faithfully rendered onto the big screen, a lot better than Fever Pitch, that's for sure. Now there's a film that sucked hard.",High Fidelity

Hi Fi is one of my Top Five books of all time (no connection intended) and I think it was translated perfectly to the big screen.  John Cusack portrayed Rob exactly as I imagined him.  Jack Black made Barry more vivid than he was in the book.  All in all this movie is well worth watching",High Fidelity

Every summer we get a breath of fresh air in this monotonous breeze. Last year it was the Matrix. This year High Fidelity is a big contender for the most UNDER-hyped film to hit the silver screen.Hilariously funny, I was surprised when my friends came out of it depressed?!?!? How can a film with the acidic sarcasm of Barry (Jack Black), the quiet humor supplied by Dick (Toss Louiso) and the wit of Rob (John Cusack) be considered depressing??? Wonders will never cease.One of my favourite features of this film is Cusack's talking-into-the-camera narration - a great touch in the screenplay.A must-see this summer, and a must-rent (if not must-buy) when its released on video/dvd...8/10",High Fidelity

John Cusack's role of Rob Gordon is truly perfect, because is the real deal picture of a whole generation. If you haven't read Nick Hornby's book, you'll probably like most, without make comparisons between movie and book. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect, and let me know new music, as Beta Band (great!), and new performers, like Jack Black! His version of Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get it On"" is pretty good.

Jack has done many movies in the past and is one of America's best loved actors.  Along with the delightful John Cusack Mr. Black makes this movie a 10.  In the movie John owns a specialist record store, and one of his employees is Jack, as you can imagine quirky hijinks ensue as Jack Black steals the spotlight.  His great singing in the film proves he can do just about anything.  Tim Robbins is also in this Record store comedy and he brings a big name to the movie.  In a dream fight scene Tim takes on John and Jack in one of the most hilarious fight scenes ever, and you'll never see it coming.  The movie's unique story and unpredictable plot twists make it a must see for all Record store junkies.  Don't miss this brilliant film!",High Fidelity

His emotionally strung-out breakdown is disturbing. Here is an actor that knows his craft and knows it well.Watch out for the air-conditioning 'alternate outcome' scene.

425,Antigoon,Life is music,6,15 February 2007,"High fidelity tells the story of Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a record store owner whom his girlfriend has just dumped. Rob is reassessing his top 5 break ups to figure out why it always goes wrong.The film's central place is the record store Championship vinyl; music geek Dick and annoying little prick Barry (the very well casted Tod Louiso and Jack Black) rule the place. Many of the scenes here are hilarious (especially when the great Tim Robbins appears) and form the heart of the film. The setting is really good, a pretty dirty shop at the edge of town, Rob and his employees are everything but commercially minded, filling the days with seemingly useless discussions (but we all know that useless discussions are very important), annoying customers and arguing  just lovely. Gradually we learn about Rob's former break ups and how he moves on in his relationship with Laura.There's no great cinematography here, no extraordinary directing or camera-work, none of that, just a very honest, enthusiastic narrating about a guy living the life and everything that goes along with it. Love, rejection, pain, happiness,  with characters which many of us will relate to, normal people in all there shortcomings, no heroes. As it's main characters, the film as well suffers from shortcomings, e.g. the part after Laura's father died, is not adding anything and there is no prominent role for music, at least not enough, truly a mistake seen the setting of the film and Rob's life which evolves around pop music.But it's hard not to sympathize with the characters and hence to like the film, it doesn't pretend to be more than what it is, I'd even say it wouldn't be as good as it is if it was made less spontaneous. The story holds a lot of truth and is lovingly told; it's warm, it's funny and it's damn real.No great cinema but good for the heart.",High Fidelity

428,destron0,A little touch of soul,9,27 June 2002,"High Fidelity: 9 of 10Let me start out by saying that I made a list of things that I liked about this movie as I watched it for the second time, and I will try my hardest to not turn this review into a list of ""things I thought were totally cool about this movie, man.""1. It's not the way you are that's important, it's the things you like. This sentiment was expressed by Rob Gordon / John Cusack during one of his narratives, and is affirmed many times, e.g. when Rob asks Barry about Evil Dead 2, a cult movie with fans of equal standing to the characters in this movie. Why is that this simple plot idea could be so dead on for snobs like you and I? Really, because only a snob would write a review on imdb and only a fellow snob would read it.2. I would swear that Dick is based upon a guy I know named Lee, except Lee is too good for Belle & Sebastian.3. Non-linear movie. Think Rashomon. Think Catch 22. Well, not quite to those degrees, but the movie has many flashbacks and much commentary outside the flow of time. The train of thought can be dropped off and picked up later in the movie without acknowledging a gap.4. ""I believe sex is a basic human right,"" Marie DeSalle. A lot of the movie is tied up in sex, and putting it in the same line as life, love, and the pursuit of happiness makes so much sense. Rob's number one agonization about breakup is sex, Laura has sex to forget her father's death, and ultimately Rob is tired of fantasizing about sex so he gets married. There is something fascinatingly romantic Rob's honest desire to become tired and old.5. And, the ultimate, record collection as extension of self. Rob rearranges his record collection when he breaks up like he is rearranging his feelings. The fact that Rob puts his records in autobiographical order when he breaks up with Laura shows from the start that Laura not being in the top 5 list is bull, she's number one. We have no indication that Rob did anything nearly as painful when he broke up with Charlie.To sum it up, I see so much of these full of life characters around me every day in our own quagmirous obsessions.",High Fidelity

430,neb-strebor,Wrong location,7,28 May 2008,This is a great book but sadly an average film. The main problem with the film was the location. Anybody who has enjoyed the book and visualized the many great scenes will be at a loss to see why they have set this film in America. The humour is very English and it seems like to get this across to an American audience they felt it necessary for John Cusack to narrate the story and explain every joke in the film. A good joke is funny but if you don't get it and someone has to explain it to you then it usually loses its meaning and thats what spoiled this film. Maybe someone will remake this film in the right setting with a cast that can deliver the lines as they were originally intended? please!,High Fidelity
431,birdland08,A Chick Flick for Guys Who Don't Like Chick Flicks,9,22 December 2002,"This is an unusual romantic comedy because it is told from the perspective of those unromantic little canines known as men.  It ridicules our fear of commitment, our willingness to endlessly (and pointlessly) argue what is or is not the best this kind of thing or the worst of that kind of thing, our appalling need to outgrow the egocentrism that comes from being raised as guys, and generally makes guys laugh at themselves because the people responsible for this movie just know us too well.Oddly enough, women seem to love this movie too.  I think it allows them to say to their boyfriends, ""There, you see?  That's you, you incorrigible, primitive, ape-like being"".Ebert put this movie among his list of great movies with Casablanca and Citizen Kane.  He may be overdoing it a little because he has a soft spot for movies related to Chicago, but not by that much.  I rated this movie 9 of 10 because it certainly is among the best of a genre I don't especially care for, and any movie that gives guys a bit of insight into themselves has more weight than its lighthearted genre usually can carry.",High Fidelity
432,1B12A,Imagination is not reality!,10,17 June 2003,"'Variety is the spice of life'. 'Familiarity breads contempt'. 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder' and last but by no means least 'Assumption is the mother of all f*%@ ups!'. For this movie - see all of the above.The film lobotomises the average single thirty something male's relationship dilemma. Through historic self-analysis Rob (Cusack) surgically probes in to the realms of 'commitment', 'dependent responsibility' and the fear of loosing the 'freedom of lustful choice', finally emerging from the 'past relationship exorcism operating theatre' content in the knowledge that he is not terminally condemned. High Fidelity is not a movie about love, nor it is a movie about trying to find love, it is instead a movie about the male's perception of love and the frustrations associated with their female partner's interpretation of the same. Ultimately we learn that love is not an emotion requiring identical thought patterns. Instead we see that love is sexless, born out of mutual dependency, personal differences, forgiveness and true friendship. No more vividly is this displayed than in Rob's loving charity towards Barry and Dick. The fantasy world of casual sex has its place too, but here lust betrays love, socially flawed by it's own shortermism and existing optimally in our imaginations. Consequently lust is flawed by the complications of reality. Ladies - see this film, please - if for no reason other than to understand (and hopefully forgive, or even learn to love?)the basic flaws inherent in the decision making process of the male species!",High Fidelity
433,skutbag,Americanization actually works here!,8,27 May 2005,"Yes you heard me. AND I'm a Brit. AND I've read the book.But why? Well, if it had been made in Britain then (possibly) some morose independent director would have made it into a depressing and painful film. That's just what I reckon would have happened, and to quote the author Nick Hornby 'This is about more than geography'.I think transplanting it to an American scene makes the whole film a bit more cheery, can you imagine Barry being played by a Brit actor? No, because unfortunately the stereotype of Brit actors in the eyes of Hollywood are villains and aristocrats, or both; not the kind of dynamo that Black pulls off to PERFECTION. He really is that good. Not forgetting Dick of course but then his role is one of understatement.Also, having watched the deleted scenes, you wish they had kept them in but I suppose everything has to be short and sharp. Don't worry if you didn't catch it at the cinema, this film is not really a visual spectacle.I would recommend this to anyone who loves music especially, as you probably know some characters like the ones you see here.",High Fidelity

At last here was a film that totally seemed to understand what it is like for guys to go through the dating minefield...i thought i was alone in being dumb founded by the many pitfalls that love can bring in its wake... couldn't believe how many times i saw myself in John Cusacks character of Rob (ok..so he's an ass-hole for a big chunk of the movie...but ain't most guys...lol). That and the fact that i was a complete music geek...completed the thing for me.

435,TAHQ,Overrated.,3,26 October 2004,"I was looking forward to see this movie because of its reputation but I must say I was disappointed. Its based on Nick Hornbys book and thats not a seal of quality for me. Have you seen 'About a boy' with Hugh Grant? Thats a Nick Hornby book to and man is it slow!High Fidelity is made in the same way, slow and boring. Some good moments in there, but nothing to give it the edge that it needs. I am not really sure what the message is in the movie... if any.Cusack makes an excellent job as always and Black is good to. The others, well not to good I must say.For this genre of films look to Spain, Italy or France! Americans don't have the humour or heart to make it.",High Fidelity
436,b_rannells,Relatable in More Ways Than One.,6,1 October 2012,"When watching ""High Fidelity"" at first it is hard to become interested in such a cynical film about love. From the very opening scene one can sense this overlying doom and depression that will take place through the entire films. John Cusack's character Rob is very harsh in his demeanor and his very first lines tend to stick with you through the rest of the film. ""Music or the misery, which came first?"" and ""did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or am I miserable because I listened to pop music."" This is a very alarming statement, many of us tend to find comfort in music which allows for a sense of self soothing. Although at first it was hard to become interested in this movie, afterwords I found it relatable to my life. Many of us have experienced the heartache that Rob is feeling after his break up with his current girlfriend Laura which is why many of us can connect with Rob.The movie is all about Rob reviewing the five women that have broken his heart throughout his whole life. We then go on this self loathing experience of ""always me"" mentality that leads us to learn more about this character and his obsession with making ""Top 5 Lists"" that are ongoing over the course of the film. Rob blames all of these women for ripping his heart out and stomping on it, when in high school its actually Rob who broke penny's heart. In what one can assume is chemistry class, Rob's lab partner tells him that he had sex with Penny after three days. An explosion happens as a result of the chemical reactants which conveys the anger and frustration and the mixed emotions Rob is feeling inside. After Rob's break up with Laura he decides to go on a journey to talk to his old girlfriends and find out what he did wrong to end their relationship. When he is talking to penny at dinner, Penny tells Rob she was crazy about him, but Rob dumped her; she was tired and emotionally drained when Rob's friend asked her out, she said yes. Later Penny tells Rob that the chemistry partner didn't rape her since she said yes but it wasn't far off from rape. He then compares his breakup with Charlie to how ""some people never got over 'Nam"" in the fact that after the break up he was scared for life and never really wanted to date again. He had a traumatic experience that sticks with him and changes his views and ideas on the world. Throughout his relationship with Charlie, Rob is very hard on himself and doesn't think he is good enough to be with a girl like her, which many of us can relate in our dating experiences. We all have our ideal dream girl or guy and once we end up with a person who meets all of our need we don't think we are equal enough to be with them which causes us to doubt our every move we make.Which brings us to his current situation working at his record store, Championship Vinyl. His record store is a symbol of how he is stuck in a rut and has been for so long and how he doesn't really want to change. The record store just displays further gloom that is overcasting Rob's life, which is ironic because the shop is vibrant inside. At his used record store two eccentric employees spend their time making up Top Five lists and poking fun of the occasional customers that the store draws. Two shoplifting teens are the burden of their existence, we later find out that the teens just want to make music and end up making a mix tape and leaving it at the store. Cusack's character becomes inspired by their song and welcomes a turning point in the film when he gives the teens a record label and starts to promote their band at a night club. After the major turning point in the movie store is getting busier, the workers are no longer making a mockery of the customers playing more audience appropriate music also.Cusack's direct address to the camera and his self-reflective narration of his failed relationships tends to become boring and allows for a loss of interest in the film until the major turning point in the record store. Although it seems like even when everything is going his way ( him and Laura got back together, he has a record label, is making a return as a DJ... etc) and he still seems unhappy with his life, and makes the viewer wonder if he will truly ever be satisfied.",High Fidelity
437,havefun2687,"Great idea, not that great of a film",7,6 January 2006,"Before starting this review i would just like to say that my two greatest loves are film and music. Therefore when i heard about this movie I just had to see it.Upon seeing this movie i was very disappointed due to my expectations. The movie is nothing special. It often drags and the story line is weak. However there are many good factors of the film too that must be pointed out.The dialogue in High Fidelity is very creative. Anyone who has a love of music or who has been in love and heart broken will be able to relate. In addition, the movie uses some really effective techniques that provide a very comical atmosphere, such as Rob (John Cusack) narrating the film and at times talking to the camera.The acting in this movie is flawless too. The actors are able to entertain and portray the characters perfectly.The characters are very well constructed. My favourite two characters would be Dick and Barry. Barry is a music lover who believes that his view on music is the only right one and Dick is a music geek. They are able to give the movie an extra comedic spark.The idea for this movie is excellent. The characters and the acting is great too. However, this isn't translated into the story line which is bland at times. Anyone who loves music and movies should enjoy this film, but should not expect to much because it is no masterpiece.",High Fidelity

440,egresh,What are your Top 5 songs about your life,9,6 March 2007,"I would take High Fidelity as an ode on music and breakup. It revolves around the life of Rob Gordon (Cusack) his love-life and breakups and his two employees Dick and Barry, arguing daily about the music in a small music store. The man topic is Rob's struggle to find a stable relationship, why his other relationships has failed. Its not mainly about his breakup with Laura, relationship with Laura, its about looking for answers. Why he ends up in painful break up, why he is afraid of committed relationship It is a comedy but its humor is very subtle, the funniest scenes are taken by Jack Black but he doesn't take it too far.I love the way it is narrated by Cusack, not in voice-over by directly in the film, while it doesn't interrupts the film at all, it really brings feeling and thoughts more closer to the audience, its more sincere, open and helps the narration, mainly in flashbacks. Without the narration, it would be a much weaker experience.His affection to music is reflected in various Top 5 music list of different topics.

442,davadog13,A true interpretation of music,10,3 December 2006,"When figuring out my favorite movie, I went back and forth between the typical Godfather II, Shawshank Redemption, etc. But I landed on this film. Never has another movie spoken such truth about music. In his first line of the movie, John Cusack indirectly defines pop music. Throughout the rest of the movie, we see his character go through highs and lows, all the while being accompanied by some of the greatest songs ever made. From The Velvet Underground to John Lennon to the Kinky Wizards. However, the music is not the only thing that makes this movie great.This movie presents one of the strongest ensemble casts I have ever seen. The three guys at the music shop played by John Cusack, Jack Black and Todd Louiso. First you've got Cusack who plays the imperfect hero like no one else could. It's hard to make a character like his likable, when he constantly makes mistakes and makes an ass of himself. Cusack comes through. Jack Black stirs everything up from his first appearance in the movie. He combines his one and only Jack Black timing with a real sense of musical snobiness that makes you want to hang out with him yourself. Last but far from least, you have Todd Louiso who can take a normal line and leave you in stitches just with his facial expressions. I've never seen anyone deliver a line like he can. With these three characters creating the backbone, and some great cameos along the way, the cast is far and above perfect.Watch this movie. It will make you fall in love with music all over again. It will make you drag out the record player and dust off your Dylan vinyl. But most of all it will make you feel. And that's what movies are all about.",High Fidelity
443,Lukas-3,You gotta love this one!,9,2 April 2000,"In a time where quality flicks have been few and far between, High Fidelity shines bright. It flows really well, with the narration from Rob Gordon (John Cusack), the record store owner, leading us from scene to scene. I left the theatre glowing, because I knew that everyone in the theatre along with me could relate to what he was talking about. It's one that speaks as one of the regular guys; it doesn't talk down to the viewer in any way. There were also some stellar supporting roles; Jack Black, who played Barry, was easily the funniest character I've seen in a long time. He's the perfect opinionated loudmouth; he'd rather give you his opinion than sell you a record that sucks. Todd Louiso (Dick) and Iben Hjejle (Laura) were a couple of others that were good as well. Tim Robbins appears briefly, but he fills his time well. Overall, it was well put together and superbly acted. I know it probably won't get any nominations from those stiffs at the Academy, but it certainly deserves a couple. Hey, Ebert actually gave this thing four stars! How bad can it be?",High Fidelity
444,meja,"Either you love it, or Hate it",9,5 November 2001,"I've read some of the reviews here on imdb. And I found it interesting that either people love this movie, or hate this movie. In my opinion, I quite enjoyed this movie, probably because of the great performance of the cast, especially Jack Black. He is so funny.And I love the music in the movie. It's probably the biggest reason why I love this movie. I mean how can you get the jokes if you have never heard of those names of the musicians? Just take my friend as an example, she was with me while seeing this movie, and Belle and Sebastian once mentioned in the movie, and my friend was just like ""Who the hell is Belle and Sebastian?"" I can imagine why it was hard for her to get the jokes.I think if you are one big music lover, you would love this movie. Or if you aren't, you may find it boring, just as some of the reviewers said in here. And if you love the movie, you should try the book. I think the book is better than the movie.

She felt it was slow, she didn't care about the characters, and she totally couldn't relate.  John Cusack's character reminded me of several college boyfriends, the references to obscure alternative bands from the 80s totally hit home with me, and I laughed through the entire movie.

Why does it play in Chicago and not in London? 2. Why is Marie La Salle called Marie De Salle? 3. Why is she black? 4. Why is Rob Flemming called Rob Gordon? 5. Why all that ""talking to the camera stuff""? And last but not least: John Cusack is just HORRIBLE as Rob !!! Didn't he read the book before??? The only good things are Dick and Barry, they're brilliant!!!!!! Guys you did a good job!",High Fidelity

I'll admit I've never read the book(sorry, wasn't aware of book.)But what's on the screen is quite entertaining. John Cusack is great as always in the lead. His character Rob personally takes you on a tour of his funny and failed romantic history. The record store owner Rob constantly loses at love due to fear,bad luck and his own bad behavior. Even though he is jerky you find yourself rooting for him get out of his own way and succeed. Danish actress Iben Hjejle is strong and beautiful as Rob's latest girlfriend who leaves him in the movie's opening. This starts Rob on his tour of history and self-awareness. Jack Black and Todd Louiso are very funny as his two ""employees"" at the record store. They do their best (or worst) to insure that the record store never see's a return customer. Look out for a large number of cameo appearances by a very talented and very famous supporting cast. I had good time and the rest of the preview crowd seemed to like it too. It's attitude is male, but all should enjoy.",High Fidelity

453,sam1,John Cusack just gets better and better!,10,4 April 2000,"The journey we experience along with John's character is introspective and fun.  High Fidelity allowed for intimacy one finds when seeing a play because he interacts with the audience by speaking directly to us, as he is trying to understand himself.  Rob involves the audience who wonders at his inability to see what he finally figures out, that is with the help of Laura.  She is the one who dumps him at the beginning of the movie, to which he responds that she should have gotten to him earlier if she really wanted to get to him.  Obviously she did get to him because it sets the premise of the whole movie.  The introspection of Rob.  Laura does seem a little preoccupied with her American Accent, but the few times her homeland comes through adds some interest.  She should have let the accent stay.  Go see this movie if you are interested in seeing John Cusack at his best.  Don't go see it if you are looking for light entertainment.",High Fidelity

It makes Notting Hill and Runaway Bride look stiff.  John Cusack holds this film together brilliantly, and his sidekicks/friends and enemies are all fun to watch.  Some stunning cameos, glad I didn't know who they were before I saw it.  The music is great also.  Oh, and did I mention I haven't laughed this much in a movie in a long time?",High Fidelity

I must admit that I have seen the film 5 times, have read the book and purchased the sound track!  It is a great story about the trials and tribulations of relationships and the painful scars most of us carry.  I could relate to the characters because they were normal people dealing with normal problems and issues.  I felt like I could walk out of the theatre and straight into Championship Vinyl and ask Rob how he and his girlfriend are getting along and ask Dick what UK Subs record he would recommend.  Is this not what good filmmaking is all about?  Check it out!",High Fidelity
456,cmeakin,"sometimes slow plot saved by great dialogue, acting. recomended.",8,31 March 2000,"This movie reminded me a (tiny) bit of Kevin Smith's works, though a little less rough about the edges.  It is witty dialogue that holds the sometimes slow plot together.  The scope of the work is fairly narrow, and doesn't touch on any profound themes. Nevertheless within its scope as a light comedy it delivers top rate wit and charm. An engaging narration style between the main character and us, the audience, helps to keep our attention and laughs.  Recomended.",High Fidelity

461,topolino-2,A Single Guy's Pity Party,1,13 July 2000,"I would like to start by stating my tremendous admiration for both John Cusack and Tim Robbins.  That being said, I must confess that I thought ""High Fidelity"" was a tremendous letdown.  I just did not care at all about any of the characters.  I did not identify with or like a single one of them.  This surprised me given that I am in my mid-20s, worked for years in an indie record store, and knew of every musical artist mentioned.Anyone who has worked in an indie record store knows how funny employees and customers can be.  This movie definitely did not capture it.  These guys were just pretentious, arrogant, asinine, and boring.Otherwise, ""High Fidelity"" was just a single guy's pity party.  Rob admits that he's an ""a**hole.""  I agree.  I was surprised by his honesty.  This is the kind of guy who you'll so often hear say something like, ""Girls only like jerks.  I'm a nice guy.  Why don't girls like me?""  Most times, it's because he IS a jerk and is just in denial.Nothing new.",High Fidelity

Unlike how this move is portrayed in the commercials and trailers it was unfortunately more relation-shippy than comedy...not that it didn't have it's moments - but they are few and far between (not to mention that dead zone in the middle).I would marginally recommend it, as a date movie (if a slightly depressing one at that). If you love John Cusack, you get a lot of him talking straight to you, it just wasn't my cup of tea. And while it has an impressive slate of actors, I would have appreciated more from some, like Tim Robbins and the dynamic record store duo....but generally too little of too many actors.",High Fidelity
463,Yurodivy,Highly Recommend,9,21 March 2000,"A witty piece with many hilarious narrative gems, High Fidelity is one of the best comedies I've seen in quite some time.

Considering I am the same age as the John Cusack character I should appreciate all the truisms.  I should have rolled with laughter in the aisles along with the other audience members at last night's screening, but the fact is I didn't.  Now don't get me wrong the film is solid with Cusack turning in a fine turn as Rob, but I just couldn't get into it. Sweet sentimental story and the obligatory quirky characters make this an inoffensive film and will probably make women think they've cracked into the male dating psyche (which is probably true). But since I seem to be the only one who didn't like the book, everyone will probably love this film.On a technical note, the opening and closing titles are terrific.",High Fidelity

Then I heard that the people who wrote Grosse Point Blank were going to write it and I was happy again.Now that I've seen it, I can tell you I will be back in line very soon to see it again (and probably again).It is just a funny movie - even if you haven't read the book.  It is a fairly accurate view of how men think.  Or don't think. One review on the back of the book warned men to not let their girlfriends read the book.  The same can be said of the movie.",High Fidelity

I thought that it was one of the most self-obsessed, somewhat racist, completely misogynist waste of time effort and money movie that I have seen for a while.A big yawn. I mean Bruce Springsteen? Negative cultural cache. The 'exotic' and 'sex-obsessed' Bonet? Haven't we seen this too many times before - and why would it be perpetrated in the name of entertainment. The sad thing is, I don't think that anyone will see this movie as offensive in the least obvious ways.At least IFC was running that Apocalypse Now and Again marathon and I could get that celluloid crap out of my system.

The people that will really, really GET IT are probably slightly older...30+ perhaps, but not more than 40-45. Anyone who's ever dabbled in rock and roll minutiae (""There's no 'the' in that title!"") will see themselves in this movie, for better or for worse. I've worked with these guys, I've been these guys, and because of that, it's totally hilarious. If you're too young, most of the references will slide right past you, just like Reality Bites (one of the referenced movies) slides right past me.

I really dug all the pop music references and especially the Pavement poster on Rob's wall.  Being from Chicago, I think I was able to enjoy the film more.  Every time I'd see Cusack standing at a certain location, I'd think: Hey, I've been there!  Great performances by Cusack (as always), Jack Black, and Todd Louiso.

The soundtrack is brilliant and John Cussack is doing a performance that is deserves an Academy Award for best actor. This film makes you anticipate in the movie all the way. This is because Cussack switches from talking to the other actors, to talking to the audience that is following everything on screen. The movie is funny and is never boring.Thomas",High Fidelity

Because of my fondness for the novel, I was apprehensive about an attempt to film it, and positively dismayed when I discovered that the setting had been transferred from London to Chicago. It seemed such an introspective, essentially British story that I feared the change of cultural context would distort it beyond all recognition. Happily, my fears were unfounded. Those involved in the adaptation seem to have shared my love for the book; they have transferred its essence, faithfully and skilfully, to an extent I would not have believed possible.

It is not driven by high line special effects (The Cell) but well thought out characters that you generally care for as a viewer.  John Cusack gives a performance that fans have come to expect, but society as a whole should stand and applaud.

It's as if ""A Night at the Roxbury"" and ""Dick"" were to copulate and have one hideous, deformed movie-child...  that child would be High Fidelity.  Not only does the movie have no redeeming value, but I can't even see what redeeming value it's SUPPOSED to have.  Apparently it was supposed to be a dramatic, romantic comedy, but I can't think of a single moment during the movie at which I felt any emotion other than an outpouring of suicidal rage.  There was no comedy whatsoever (unless gratuitous use of ""F***"" counts as comedy), no romance whatsoever (unless talking about people you had sex with counts as romance), and no drama whatsoever (unless you count the precious seconds until the movie is over).  Avoid this movie like the plague.  In fact, if you have the choice, choose the plague -- I wish I could say that I am exaggerating, but High Fidelity has taken 113 minutes of my life away that could have been used to drown myself in a bathtub so as to never be forced to endure such a horrible, traumatic film.",High Fidelity

Unlike the ugly hybrid mutant blockbusters around at the time, Frears successfully tied-in these genres, creating, what will be, a timeless time capsule. The music and memories goes together like John Cusack and sarcasm. The deliverance of the agitated 30 something is portrayed in his career best performance as he guides us through his experiences with the opposite sex, his insecurities, embarrassing moments and angst found in and amongst the feeling of love.The autobiographical narrative is also delivered brilliantly by Cusack. Sucking us into the screen, making the film so personal.The thing i love the most is the passion about the music.

Has he ever been more in his element? No, it is in this movie that he shines, and perhaps because he can play himself largely. Top 5 listswhat is it about making these kinds of lists? Why did I enjoy doing it so much when I was young? I think because a list contains within it the notion of perfection, or if not that, at least a notion of the superlative.

There is plenty to mock about this sort of individual, and this movies does it very well.The real joy of the film, though, is that the film also shows you that elitists are people, too.  John Cusack is terrific as Rob, the music shop owner with personal and personnel problems.  He is utterly believable, and yet a likeable character for all his faults.The direction is good, too, though I personally find the ""is this a day-dream or is it real?"" scenes a little annoying.This movie is definitely worth a rental or two, and for you film elitists out there, you can see Jack Black at his pre-Shallow Hal best.",High Fidelity

John Cusack keeps talking to the camera while everybody else in the screen pretends as if the camera is not present. this takes away the originality a movie should have. one more point worth noting is why is he analysing all the top 5 relationships he has had and contacting all his old girl friends when it is anybodys guess they would have moved on and the stupidest thing is he is still in love or he pretends to be in love with the girl he broke up with.

Imagine my surprise (and the surprise of everyone else who read the book and then saw the film) when the movie was transported to Chicago.Taking a story written from the standpoint - and cultural milieu - of London, England, and transporting it to Chicago, Illinois, really ripped the heart out of the movie. The location change was self-indulgent on somebody's part, and wholly unnecessary. And not only was the location changed, but the music that the story revolved around was also changed.Imagine putting a story about the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Paris or Brussels - the location change for High Fidelity makes about as much sense as this.

He says that this is the most amazing collection he has seen and says he can't afford the collection. She says simply, ""Fifty bucks"". The ensueing (sp?) dialogue is priceless and for any music fiend, it is hysterical.This is an amazing movie.

491,the3droogs,Falls Way Short of the Urgency of the Book,4,25 April 2003,"Nick Hornby's novel ""High Fidelity"" was a compulsively readable, daring piece. It combined moments of hilarity with a mindblowing epiphany that completely changes protagonist Rob's life. Sadly, this is all missing in this weak adaptation. John Cusack is convincing for the most part as Rob, but at times comes across as too shrill and obnoxious to ever have been even considered by the women he dates. But this is nothing compared to the series of almost comical miscastings that occur within the film. Iben Hjelje takes on the crucial role of Rob's girlfriend and decimates it with her expressionless monotone. Lisa Bonet, while a fine actress, does not capture the air of grace that folk-singer Marie really should possess. Beside this, the script is generally weak and it truly does lose something in bringing a quisentially British book into an American setting. So is the movie a total loss? Well, no. Jack Black and Todd Luiso are equal parts hilarious and touching in their portrayals of sad sack 30-somethings working at a record store. Their scenes are the only moments of brightness in this dull, dull film.",High Fidelity
492,Funkapus,Honesty Never Felt So Good,10,13 December 2002,"Who says familiarity breeds contempt?  In this film of heart break, betrayal, true friendship, and love, Cusak adapts Hornby's book perfectly, melding self doubt, fear of death, and a search for truth with modern cinema and pop music.  Rob, Dick, and Barry are all struggling men in their late twenties (thirties in the book) trying to find a way to identify themselves, and live at peace.  Rob has the most conflict as he flounders through one relationship to another, never getting comfortable, and always finding a way to mess it up.  It's a brilliant tale of coming to terms with reality, and having a bit of fun along the way.  The casting was pheonimal, scenes perfectly picked, and music parallelling that of the mood set in the book. It's just a shame so much had to be cut.

I even googled this and saw the 7/10 rating on inns, which is the reason I'm wasting more time doing this review in hopes of helping other unsuspecting potential viewers so they wouldn't waste their time. Ironic thing about doing this review is that spell check won't allow John's last name or this site's name which it corrected to inns.",High Fidelity

I thought all the characters were perfect. John Cusack I love, he seems always believable (except Grosse Pointe that I thought the dialog was continually too clever) and goes between caring thoughtful sincere scenes to emotionally charged ones with great insight. I loved the music morons. They were perfect and so different but typical that they would end up friends. Laura was great, she was just looking for some growth, and although made her own mistakes ended up supporting her man and helping him grow along with her",High Fidelity

I personally didn't identify with the whole record store clerk persona.  But let me say, Tim Robbins became a god in his role as Ian Raymond the pestuos (think i just made that word up) unclean thorn in Rob's side who is nailing his love interest.  I think, hell i don't even remember it that well. See it for Tim.",High Fidelity

Maybe it's just because it's a big city and many types of people are represented, but there seemed to be something Chicagoan about them.Being past my twenties, I was able to see my younger self in the main character.  I had a similar feeling of mild discomfort as when I read ""The Magus"" by John Fowles.  Both that book and this movie explore the narcissism of young men - the latter much more humorously.On the other hand, this isn't necessarily just a comedy.  Whether it does it well or ill, it tries to be ""real"".",High Fidelity
498,scheibi76,Comedy and One Man's Wisdom,10,15 June 2003,"I will probably never understand how anyone cannot like this movie. It made my Top 5 the very first time I saw it, and it gets better every time I see it again. So many great performances, noteworthy besides John Cusack and Jack Black are of course Tim Robbins and Todd Louiso; loads of great music...Though many of the guys here think that Rob Gordon is somewhat of a sissy, I can still identify with him. Life can be a beach. Or something like that. ;o) And after all, the wise conclusion at the end of this film is one that opened my eyes by the first time I saw HF.Adorable flick, a 10 out of 10.",High Fidelity
499,marketingmark,Loony like me!,10,11 January 2004,"This film is one of my all time faves. Told from a decidedly male perspective, it captures the essence of men that struggle to retain their dignity in the post-feminist lunacy of man/woman relationships. I personally relate to the lead character to an unnerving degree - just ask the women who've had the opportunity to experience my neurosis in all of their technicolour splendour. Hello Angela. All that was missing from the stellar soundtrack was one of many apropos tracks from that way cool band from Canada, the Pursuit of Happiness. John Cusack and his sister/co-star Joan are a treasure - let's hope they continue to choose the road less travelled, and Jack Black is...well...er...he's Jack Black, man! BRAVO to all, especially the novelist, Nick Hornby, who also wrote ""How to be Good"". In the age of endless Hollywood re-makes, action and nonsense films (Cat in the Hat???); a good original story will draw me in everytime! Cheers!",High Fidelity

501,ILoveMcFly,High Fidelity - Narrative Report,9,30 June 2005,"This film is built around different top 5 lists. The protagonist Rob Gordon (John Cusack) lets us into his life and through his depression and self-analysis he describes us his top 5 all time break up list, throughout the film. Stephen Frears uses a wide range of narrative techniques to make the film have a more entertaining yet poignant look at breaking up.Frears uses a non-linear narrative to lay out the film so we can gain different information as the films goes on. When the film begins we start at the middle; this is the day when he and Laura (Iben Hjelle) first break up. Then eventually as his depression and self-analysis develops, flashbacks are used and we go to the beginning. This is where he begins to show us the start of his top 5 all time break up list. The film soon jumps back to where it left off and as Rob continues to describe his thoughts and feelings as he begins to show us more and more about his life.Frears uses a restrictive narrative so we don't have any more knowledge about the break ups than Rob. This also gives Rob power over us because we will only know what he shows us. Frears also uses little cause and effect narrative in his film, he does this when Rob thinks about his top 5 break up list (cause) and then when he actually goes to visit the girls some time after (effect). During the middle he goes into more self-analysis and goes into more detail of why the girls might have ""dumped"" him and why it didn't work out.As the film continues Rob also persists with how he and Laura could still work out. He goes into even more depression when he uncovers that Laura has been having an affair with Ian (Tim Robbins) this is when he really starts look at his life and then later decides to go and visit his ex girlfriends.Frears also uses different narrative techniques to allow us learn more about him and the way he thinks. The most commonly used narrative technique is direct address. He mainly uses this when he comes to a point and he is unsure what he thinks so he decides to try and analyse what he thinks and come to a conclusion. He does this when he analyses the reasons why his mutual friend Liz (Joan Cusack) has just marched into the place he and his employees; Dick (Todd Luiso) and Barry (John Black) are hanging and she shouts at him ""I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background"" then she continues to describe what Laura told her and how she no longer thinks of Rob how she used to. This is when he directly addresses the audience and tells us what he thinks about the situation, or at least what he thinks he thinks. He tells us individually the five things, which Laura might have told Liz to make her act the way she did. I think this particular narrative technique is very effective as it shows us the way that Rob thinks and does things and also it also allows us to reflect on the way things occur.Frears uses a series of images of which Rob imagines. He uses these when Rob is experimenting in his head so he can find out the truth to something. A good example of this is when he imagines Ian having sex with Laura after the break up. Yet we later find out that Laura has not yet had sex with Ian so Rob is clearly imagining things.This film fits neither Propp nor Todorov's narrative models; however, it does almost fit Todorov's technique as it does have stages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of some description.",High Fidelity
502,andrew-hamilton,Better Than The Book,9,14 April 2005,"A film being better than the book is pretty unusual, I think, but this is definitely the case here. The main character of the Nick Hornby book is more annoying and dispiriting than the guy played by John Cusack. I couldn't relate to the book-version Rob's mean-spiritedness and his relentless selfishness. Hornby apparently said the book was about 'England', but his main character isn't someone I recognize, and I'm British. Yes, the English have their sad-sacks, but someone this 'sad' (British meaning) is way off the chart, even in places like Peckham. He was a depressing guy to read about. So chopping out the worst excesses of the annoying Rob lightens the tone of the movie a lot, and the fact that they kept the humorous bits in - the top five lists, the musical snobbery, the talking to the camera / reader saying things like 'I swear I'm not making this up' - makes the movie the story the book should have been, I reckon. And the excellent performances from John Cusack (co-writer), Jack Black, and the weird little guy who plays 'Dick' make the funny bits even funnier. All-in-all a really well done movie. From Rob's girlfriend walking out on him at the beginning through to Jack Black's amazing singing at the end, hardly a bum note in the whole piece.",High Fidelity
503,dd66,Great laugh and truthful story,9,14 January 2005,"Actually I saw the movie first, then read the book. Both are excellent. I've had a great time watching the movie and I really love John Cusack and Tim Robbins in the scene they meet. I wasn't able to breath from laugh - really. Barry and Dick are glorious. The story is not quite easy to get, you have to watch the movie properly to get all the jokes and relations! Since you get along with Rob, you'll dive into his life and thoughts, you realize how truthful this movie is. Even so, it's hilarious and funny. Anyway - during the 2-hours time there are some blind spots where the tempo goes down a bit, but never mind. You can use the time to relax a bit and be prepared for another great round. But the result - you'll get a great 2 hours with some little plot holes, but still excellent! And remember - there's a lot of facts anyone can recall in his own life.",High Fidelity
504,ella_blue2,"Rob Gordon finds himself trying to navigate life, love, break-ups, and heartache while owning, managing, and working in a record store.",9,22 August 2013,"This is one of my favorite movies because I originally loved the book and it translated well to film! Nick Hornby's writing of the male monologue is witty, insightful, humorous, and unparalleled.I did I have a critique of the casting of Iben Hjejle as the current relationship and catalyst for the movie. I think that there could've been a better fit for that role, but with that said, she did fine. Other than Hjejle, there was an all star supporting cast in this movie: Jack Black, Joan Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Tim Robbins to name a few! These guys all helped make the movie fun and memorable ... especially Black who stole more than a few scenes!""Top 5 ..."" is the running theme throughout the film. A break-up with his long term, live-in girlfriend inspires him to re-live his ""Top 5"" break-ups. He contacts his past girlfriends to meet and rehash the past in order to understand ""what went wrong?"". As is typical in most relationships there are 2 sides to every story-Rob has a few surprises thrust upon him along the way. The audience has a few surprises about Rob served up to them as well. I think Hornby did a great job creating a truly 3-dimensional character; one that has faults but is still appealing. Cusack did a great job showing all sides of Rob.The record store, ""Championship Vinyl"", supplies us with 2 lovable misfits (Barry-Black and Dick) who were hired for part- time but never seem to leave. All three play off each other well creating a chemistry that guarantees laughs. The ""Top 5"" theme carries on into the shop in a few different ways. My favorite example of this is when they pose a question such as name the ""Top 5 songs about death"" and then the three of them will try to beat each other to death with their musical snobbery ... which they do to their customers on a daily basis! Music is present throughout the entire film. It is so essential to the plot that one could make the case that music is the glue that holds this film together or even better it's the gas in which it runs on for those 113 minutes.All in all, this is an absolutely excellent film which I highly recommend! It is still, after all of these years, one of my favorites. The story of Rob's ""midlife crisis"" is a classic tale that everyone can relate to but is told in such a creative way and gives a fresh perspective which is what keeps it current. The soundtrack itself heightens the story. My ""Top 5 Reasons that make 'High Fidelity' a must see"": 1. Great writing 2. Relatable material 3. Humor and wit 4. Amazing cast 5. Sensational soundtrack",High Fidelity
505,wendy-34953,Brilliant movie,10,24 May 2015,"Not even sure where to begin but I will say this is a brilliant movie. I could watch it every single day and never get tired of it. Cusack has an amazing chemistry that draws you in to him and just makes you want him (assuming you are female, lol). It is also Jack Black at his brilliant best. So many memorable scenes. Also so nice to see Natalie Wood's daughter Natasha in a bit part which she played beautifully. Not really made before the days of cell phones per se, but no cell phones or anything electronic to distract people in this movie which gives a feeling of simple comfort to it. It does not really even feel dated even though it was made 15 years ago. This really is one of the ""all-time greats "", lol, if you see the movie, you will know what I mean.. They really don't make movies with as much content, story humor and guts as this one has! If you are really into music and what it can do for people , you will also appreciate this movie.",High Fidelity
506,chickybabe_jc,my favorite film,10,25 July 2005,"this is a great film. not only does this movie look into the dysfunctional nature of men in relationships, it is also very funny and has outstanding performances by John Cusack and Jack Black in particular. Cusack is neurotic and yet still lovable, his life and break-ups all center around his music, he constantly makes lists (usually of 5). High Fidelity has both a serious and funny side. the way he narrates through his top five break ups is highly entertaining and is a great way to present them instead of him just listing them off with them having no real meaning to you. the idea that he goes back to visit all his old girlfriends was initially quite hilarious but then i saw another side that he was desperate for validation and in someways attention.jack black is awesome and the scene when the three of them beat up Ian is radical. a great film all in all. was very happy with the transition from novel to screen also 10 stars or points or whatever this is great!",High Fidelity
507,rodrigolarrain,Just a perfect atemporal gem...,10,30 May 2016,"I've seen this movie countless times in a 10 years span. Is one of the few movies that changes depending you emotional state. Background romantic flick, hilarious comedy, real life drama, state of the art script to analyze line by line and should I start with the soundtrack? Being realistic with a 9, Why not a 10? I've seen this movie with lots of women and to be honest they are not fond of the main character, well, that's real life. Yes, he is s a misogynist bastard with an excellent taste in music but that's real life people. This movie has no time, it works in the 80s, 90s, 20s and on...This movie is a gem.Frears + Hornby + Cusack = 10.",High Fidelity
