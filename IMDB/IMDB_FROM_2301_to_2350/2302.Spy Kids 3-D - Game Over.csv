0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not awful, but could have been much better.",4,31 July 2009,"I did like the first two movies, which had a sense of fun, but despite a wonderful idea, Spy Kids 3D fails to live up to the standard of the first two movies.I will say though that the 3D effects are more than decent, and there are spirited performances from Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. And I did really like the idea of the story, it was a very original idea, sadly the execution was patchy.The storyline was sadly very predictable, and despite the impressive images on screen, it failed to have a sense of wonder. Another problem was that the script was very devoid of humour, and while the first two movies were well written and had some funny moments, this instalment had one or two laughs scattered here and there, but overall was a bit limp, and the finale was rather disappointing.The acting certainly wasn't awful, it was just a little uninspired. The two leads are fine and Ricardo Montalban is surprisingly very good as the grandfather, and while Antonio Banderas, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub and George Clonney did their best, the uneven script disallowed them to have any sense of fun. The actor I was most disappointed with, sorry guys, was Sylvester Stallone. Now I like Stallone, and I consider Oscar(1991) one of the most unfairly underrated movies ever, and I like a fair majority of his work. But here I felt he was out of character playing the villain. Hamming it up, a phrase I usually despise describes his acting here perfectly, and he overdoes it shamelessly at times.Overall, Spy Kids 3D isn't terrible, it is just mediocre, and could have been much better. 4/10 for the 3D effects, and the efforts of the cast.

1,Leofwine_draca,The worst yet,3,13 January 2018,"GAME OVER is the third of the increasingly poor SPY KIDS franchise from director Robert Rodriguez. As I like the director's adult fare I thought I might get a kick out of these too, but they turn out to be very juvenile outings with overacting from the unrestrained child actors and plotting overcome by sheer stupidity. The one consistent thing about the series is the awful quality of the special effects, where you see CGI at its very worse. This time around, most of the story is set in a video game virtual reality world, so at least the graphics have an excuse to be bad. Sylvester Stallone, who you feel sorry for, plays the new villain who the kids have to fight against, but it's all interminable action scenes and unfunny humour. Endless cameos from series regulars like Danny Trejo, George Clooney, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Paxton do nothing to offset the boredom induced by sitting through this nonsense.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
2,SnoopyStyle,so many things,3,29 December 2015,"Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has retired from the spy game. His sister Carmen (Alexa PenaVega) has been captured by the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) in his video game. The Toymaker is using the game to escape from prison and take over the world. Juni has to get pass level 5 which is suppose to be unwinnable. Along the way, he finds new friends with the help of Grandfather (Ricardo Montalban).Juni needs a partner. I don't understand why Robert Rodriguez wrote this movie this way. At first, I thought Alexa PenaVega was too busy. Then she shows up halfway through the movie so she wasn't busy after all. I don't understand why the movie has Juni alone for half of the movie. When Gerti Giggles shows up early, I actually thought she's his new partner. The movie does give him Demetra which does work to some extend. I do like her character.The other problem is the video game. I need the various levels to be more definitive. It needs it to be more logical. It needs to understandable. It becomes a bunch of random craziness that isn't that compelling. Rodriguez may also be over his head with the technical requirements of the CGI 3D animation. If this is better written, it would still be good as a 2D movie.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
3,jboothmillard,Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over,2,6 January 2008,"I saw this on TV, so I didn't have any 3D glasses (although I did for a few minutes find a way, the blue and red wrappers in Quality Street, but it got annoying), then again, I dunno if I'd want to see a full 84 minutes in 3D, imagine your eye sight for a while, directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City). Basically Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) is alone at home, and realises that his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) has been kidnapped by the new villain, the Toymaker (a ridiculous Sylvester Stallone, although I hadn't seen him for a little while, he deservedly won a Razzie). She is trapped inside a real video game that he has created, and with the help of some technicians, Juni has to go in and get his sister out by passing the many levels, and be careful not to lose too many lives. He does this with the help of his crippled Grandfather (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan's Ricardo Montalban), well, he's not crippled in the game world of course, and some other kids trying to get out with him. He manages to rescue Carmen and the other kids, but there is a brief moment where unseen (apart from special glasses) monsters are attacking, and with the help of other characters from the two previous films have to defeat them, and then the Toymaker. Also starring Antonio Banderas as Gregorio Cortez, Carla Gugino as Ingrid Cortez, King of the Hill and Beavis and Butt-Head creator Mike Judge as Donnagon Giggles, Salma Hayek as Cesca Giggles, Richard 'Cheech' Marin as Felix Gumm, Danny Trejo as Machete, Alan Cumming as Fegan Floop, Men in Black's Tony Shalhoub as Alexander Minion, Steve Buscemi as Romero, Bill Paxton as Dinky Winks, George Clooney as Devlin and Elijah Wood as The Guy. You can tell even without 3D glasses which moments ""stick out"" (LOL), but this is not an impressive film. Stallone is too kooky as four personalities, there is no real story, the chat is too corny, and only kids will enjoy it, it is just stupid. Pretty poor!",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
4,BA_Harrison,3-D my arse!,3,24 May 2010,"Carmen (Alexa Vega) has been trapped inside a new virtual reality video game designed by the megalomaniacal Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone, in perhaps the worst performance of his career) who hopes to use his product to enslave the younger generation. In order to save his sister, Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) must enter the game and work his way to the unbeatable fifth level.Before watching Spy Kids 3-D Game Over, be sure to carefully adjust your TV, as per the instructions on the DVD; only that way can you truly appreciate what a lousy 3D system Robert Rodriguez has employed for this third part in his Spy Kids saga. The colours are terrible, the picture is blurry, and the effect is so flat that you may find yourself stopping the film to check that you haven't accidentally popped in the 2D version by mistake.It's a shame the gimmick is so crap, because if the extra dimension had worked better, I might have been a bit more forgiving about the terribly weak plot and the total waste of an impressive cast: Rodriguez's lame script consists primarily of a series of silly FX laden set pieces, the best of which borrows heavily from The Phantom Menace's pod race, and also shoe-horns in some gag-worthy sentimentality; and for much of the running time, the film rests heavily on the shoulders of Daryl Sabara, who simply hasn't got the acting chops for such a task. Poor Sabara desperately needs support from his on-screen family (Vega, Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Danny Trejo), but they don't turn up till the film is almost over, and the film's biggest names (Stallone aside) are merely confined to amusing cameos: Salma Hayek as Mrs. Giggles; George Clooney as the President; and Elijah Wood as 'The Guy', the game's Neo-style pseudo-saviour.With each successive sequel proving to be much worse than its predecessor, I can't say that I hold out much hope for the upcoming Spy Kids 4: Armageddon (although, admittedly, it will be nice to see Alexa Vega again, now that she's all growed up!).",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
5,studioAT,Game over?,2,12 May 2011,Or so we thought after this 3rd outing for the Spy Kids but now it seems that a new film is on the cards with the series being rebooted for a new audience.This film was fun and at it's time unique through it's use of 3D but was let down by a weak plot. The mass cameos at the end cannot save it and I think even the director knew that the franchise had come to a sticky halt.It is a prime example of a film series where the third part lets it down due to a lack of fresh ideas and the fact that there are so many characters to try and bring back.Stallone is the best thing about this film and if you see it then you'll know how tongue in cheek that remark was.,Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
6,sunwarrior13,The 3D Effect Installment,8,11 April 2015,"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is the third installment of the Spy Kids series and a fantasy adventure film from Robert Rodriguez.It features many of the cast members from Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as Carmen and Juni Cortez respectively together with Antonio Banderas,Carla Gugino,Ricardo Montalbán,Holland Taylor and Mike Judge.It also stars Sylvester Stallone as the kids' new nemesis,The Toymaker. In third movie,Carmen is trapped inside a reality game designed by the Toymaker.Juni takes responsibility of saving his sister and the world as well as it is in danger of the new nemesis' hands.The movie has a great premise.The visual effects - the 3D effect - was also great.Too bad that asking Daryl Sabara to carry the film from beginning to end somehow minimized the interest in the story as the presence of his sister - Alexa Vega - as well as his parents - Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino - are very much needed in the story.Too bad that even Stallone's presence isn't enough to make it better.But nevertheless,it his presence did help in the box office as it did earn more money compared to the second installment and almost matched the original.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
7,preppy-3,Not as good as the first...,6,15 August 2003,"...I never saw the second, but this was OK.The story is kind of confusing.  Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has to enter a video games designed by the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone!!!) to save his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) and aided by his grandfather (Ricardo Montalban). And the game, if activated, will control all the minds of the children playing them.I didn't like the movie at first.  The plot was vague, the jokes silly and when Juni enters the game no rules are given.  Very annoying...and I never liked video games anyways.  But eventually the story clears up, the special effects are impressive and (best of all) the whole trip inside the game (95% of the movie) is in 3-D!  I've always loved wearing those glasses and having things thrown at you.  The effects didn't always work (sometimes I saw double images instead of 3-D) but when it did work it was great!  And I didn't have one of those 3-D headaches afterwards!The acting was just OK--this movie was basically made to show off the special effects.  And top-billed Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have maybe 10 minutes screen time combined--although Banderas is clearly having a FUN time!  Montalban is just great as the kids grandfather but Stallone is disappointing as the main villain.  He tries but he was never good at doing comedy.  So I'm giving it a 6 mostly for the special effects and the 3-D.  Forget what little there is of a story.  Also stay seated for some funny outtakes right after the 3-D closing credits.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
8,neil-476,Decent movie for youngsters,7,26 August 2020,"For his third (and final, until he did a 4th) foray into the Spy Kids universe, Robert Rodriguez sends them into a computer game masterminded by wicked Sylvester Stallone.As ever, Darryl Sabara and Alexa Vega play the spy siblings, a batch of other kids play assorted allies and enemies, and a bunch of high profile buddies of Rodrigues cameo as assorted bizarre adults.most of the settings are, to a greater or lesser extent (usually greater), CGI, and the 3D is real in-yourface coming atcha! stuff.This is going to annoy a certain mentality, but for those who are prepared to enjoy a good-natured, eye-catching romp with a whiff of cheese about it, aimed formly at the younger viewer, this has a lot to recommend it",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
9,anaconda-40658,Please Let the Game Be Over!,5,30 July 2015,"Spy Kids: 3D-Game Over (2003): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Daryl Sabara, Alexa Vega, Ricardo Montalban, Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas: Lifeless 3D sequel about kids being controlled or entrapped in video games. Central plot regards a toy maker who invites kids to literally become part of a video game where they remain trapped if they lose. Juni Cortez sets to rescue his sister and is aided by his wheelchair bound grandfather. Lame plot with only its 3D images to gain any interest. Directed by Robert Rodriguez who isn't nearly as successful here as he was with the first film. Daryl Sabara plays Juni who accepts the task at hand and prevails through disaster until arriving at a corny climax. Alexa Vega as his sister gets to be a prisoner in the game until Sabara bails her ass out. Ricardo Montalban as the grandfather is the best performance going from disabled to becoming the puzzle piece that matters as well as do the one thing that the villain wasn't prepared for. Sylvester Stallone as the toy maker is involved in a lot of corny scenes but it appears that Stallone is laughing at himself, which makes his performance somewhat tolerable. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino return as the parents but they are merely making cameos at this point. Despite its message regarding video game addiction the film seems purposed as a money making gimmick. Score: 5 / 10",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
10,mm-39,Not bad not good,6,2 August 2003,"This movie is not good or bad, but okay.  I wanted to see a 3-D movie since the early 80's craze.  My dad said we would go, and put it off and off until we checked the paper, and there were no 3-D movies left.  I waited 20 years and when we were going to see it last Monday a transformer blew and the movie theater was closed.  We drove across town, and it was too late the movie was on.   The next day Tuesday we got in and finally the wait was over.  Some of the 3-D effects were awful, and others were wow.  In the end the 3-D was just okay.  The video game story was okay, but I like video games, and Stallone played a good cameo. Go see it in the theater, 3-D is much better there than on the TV, I remember when I was a kid 7-11 sold the glasses for some cheesy 3-D ape movie and yuck.  They also had a bud bowl in 3-D but the Canadian commercial content law blocked it out, those jerks.  I always wondered what the commercial was like.  I give this movie a 6 out of 10.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
11,cherold,irredeemably stupid,5,28 August 2004,"What a mess. There are clever ideas here and there, a few laughs, the occasional decent special effect (I saw this on TV so didn't see it in 3D, which perhaps would have made the generally disappointing effects more impressive), but the lame, tossed-together script and the lack of any cohesion to the final product make this only barely watchable. This movie seems to just be going through the motions; you can't even call it formulaic because it barely attempts to even stick with any formula, it's more like random stuff thrown in here and there. As for the ending, well, it's main purpose was to create an excuse (and not a very good one) to have cameos by everyone who was in the first two movies (allowing them to list Bandaras first in the credits even though he's on screen for only a couple of minutes), and the final showdown is so utterly moronic that words fail me.At the same time, I didn't actually hate it. I wasn't in pain watching it. It was a mindless Saturday afternoon movie and I watched it as mindlessly as I could and occasionally enjoyed it. But after the very fun second movie (which I thought superior to the first), this was a great disappointment. I'd advise skipping it.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
12,g-bodyl,Disappointed!,4,7 December 2010,"I really enjoyed the first two movies. But when I saw this one I was so disappointed. When I saw this in theaters, I enjoyed it but I seen so many movies since. That made me think this movie was lame. The 3D is terrible. Granted this movie came out in 2003 but after Avatar this movie doesn't come close. I was also disappointed with the story line. The ending is pretty bad too.Juni and Carmen return as the Spy Kids and they are transported into a video game to defeat the Toymaker so he doesn't take control of the children and the world.The acting is okay. I think Sabara and Vega took a step down from the second film. I was even disappointed at Stallone here. I wanted him to be better.Overall, this is a pretty disappointing film. There were some good moments but the majority of the movie is pretty bad. I hope the fourth one coming out next year is better. I rate this film 4/10.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

I had the unfortunate problem of having smudged 3-D glasses along with sunblock that made my eyes sting and water throughout the first 3/4 of the movie. This pretty straight forward video arcade/virtual reality version of 3-D had its moments, but nothing that a traditional movie like Tron could have handled with more excitment. As for a 3-D entertainment, this version is one of the better ones compared to what's out there - this one had a plot and the soft landing ending was nice for a change.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

Carmen (Alexa Vega) is caught in a virtual reality game designed by the Kids' new nemesis, the Toymaker (Stallone). It's up to Juni (Daryl Sabara) to save his sister, and the world.I'll admit from the off that I enjoyed the first two movies, and I love both Vega and Sabara, I find them to be a joy to watch. I know the plot calls for her not to be seen much but Alexa Vega is woefully under used. Which is a shame as she was excellent in both the previous movies. The parents Antonio Banderas and Carla Guigino are both reduced to cameos which is also a shame. This leaves Sabara to mainly carry the movie on his own, he tries hard, a little too hard as his charm from the excellent first movie, and less excellent but still highly enjoyable sequel is missing. Sly is clearly enjoying himself, playing an over the top (Yes pub intended) villain and is clearly having a lot of fun. Ricardo Montalban brings grace and dignity to everything he does. Danny Trejo and Cheech Martin aren't given as much to do this time around. Nor is Holland Taylor, which is s shame!!

16,John6Daniels,How exactly are they spies?,1,5 February 2017,"This is a review for all 3 movies. I watched all 3 this weekend. Seen the 1st one years ago as a kid back in 2001 and I loved it. Now 2017 lets see what I think.The first one is tolerable and you can see that they are spies and for a first take movie. During that time period it was cool to see the effects and style.Second movie. It's all forgettable. As I type this I can't remember what happened. Anyways, Spy Kids 2 was garbage. It made no sense, green screen sucked, effects sucked and why are they called spies?
Was there even a villain in this movie because the Giggle guy was also in the 3rd one without any punishment it seems. 2nd Spy Kids movie is a waste of time. The 1 thing that baffles me is that Juni gets the blame when he didn't really do anything but do the right thing.3rd spy kids movie would work if they didn't call them spy kids. Iunno why they call them spy kids when they don't do anything spyish. His sister was barely in the movie. The villains always go from evil guy to good guy without some form of punishment for what they have done. This movie was garbage, the green screen even in those days looked bad.In-conclusion only movie of the 3 worth watching is the 1st one, even tho all movies are a waste of time. Only good of the movies were the mom and dad but even after the 1st one they are portrayed as clumsy wash ups.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
17,briancham1994,Bizarre vignettes,5,23 August 2020,"This film is more like a series of bizarre CGI vignettes that would have been better as individual TV episodes, all strung together by an excuse of a premise.

18,Rodrigo_Amaro,I Can't Believe I Watched The Whole Thing. It's Really Bad!,1,1 June 2010,"A exactly 2 months ago (April 1st and this is not a lie, you can check my reviews) I opened my movie sessions with ""TRON"" and it was a completely disappointing movie about a technician who must enter into a video game to destroy a powerful villain. First of all I have never watched anyone of those ""Spy Kids"" movie series. Lack of trust? Lack of interest? Lack of time? Who knows? All I know is that I attempt to watch ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" because I was awake, with nothing better to do and I knew that there's a big and great cast in it. Result: A boring movie and visual video game played by director Robert Rodriguez with a pathetic ending. I usually tend to simplify the story of the movie, explaining details of the plot but I won't do that. Perhaps just a little bit. It's like ""TRON"" except that this time the former spy boy Juni (Daryl Sabara, a tiny version of Jensen Ackles with almost the same angered expression) must enter into a dangerous video game created by a sarcastically villain (played by Sylvester Stallone, totally hammy) that kidnapped Juni's sister (Alexa Vega). The whole film is Juni trying to figure out a way to reach the next level and save his sister, with the help of some friends and his grandfather (Ricardo Montalban, the only good performance here). Why this movie sucked? First: I have a total dislike for movies who basically is 80% special effects with scenarios moving all the time, all those blinding colors. Annoying. I hated this one, hated ""Speed Racer"" and the only one I really liked of this new wave of movies was ""Captain Sky and The World of Tomorrow"" (needs a urgent sequence) because that was great, had a interesting plot, the visual concept was incredible and it resurrected Laurence Olivier (it's archive footage of one of his films but that's OK). Second: I don't even know if kids are that dumb to want to watch something like this. This movie wants to be too many things; want to be a comedy without funny things, want to be a spy movie but can't even kill a character and not even make a evil villain. By the way the villain played by Stallone multiplies himself into three other sad characters. If kids have enjoyed this or even adults enjoyed this film then perhaps my heart grows colder and I don't know what I'm saying. All I know is that this movie was pretty bad.Third: Here comes the list of actors who unfortunately appeared in this movie in commitment to friendship or loyalty to the director, executives and producers, and or are in it for the money: Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub (I must have missed his scene or he's very different so I couldn't find him), Bill Paxton, Matt O'Leary, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Ryan Pinkston, and of course Stallone and the child actors, and at last but not least George Clooney. In the very last scene of the movie, during the outtakes and funny movie mistakes Clooney appears saying a brief statement: This could be the end of my career (and then he burst in laughs more than that we didn't saw at 2010's Oscar). Yes, he's right about that. It could've been the end but after this film he made things far more interesting, won a Oscar, directed, wrote and acted in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and more. In short: a movie that didn't needed to be made. Game and review over. 1/10",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
19,johnnyboyz,"Given the names in front of the camera are what they are, and that Robert Rodriguez is the one propelling the project, it is remarkable just how awful this really is.",4,22 October 2011,"Game Over. Game Over is the sub-heading to this third Spy Kids film, and boy does ""Game Over"" just about sum it up. This second sequel, in what has been, in all honesty, a laborious and solemn franchise of child-induced shenanigans and daft spectacle more often than not the wrong side of painful, is near-to unwatchable; a tumbling, spindly, visually ugly little piece rotten to sit through and annoying to think about. American director Robert Rodriguez has always been the king of a kind of crass; a filmmaker often making gleefully scuzzy B-movies, from his own scripts, which riff on either science fiction or crime - more often than not pulling them off. The Spy Kids films have always been where Rodriguez strikes out; his foundations built on guerrilla filmmaking, in El Mariarchi, gave way in equal tandem to both Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Assualt on Precinct 13 pastiches, in 1998's The Faculty as well as 1996's From Dusk till Dawn, respectively, which further still led much more recently onto postmodern homages of the Grindouse movement and classical Hollywood noir. Spy Kids, and its sequels, just seem to be the lame and unnecessary blot on your man's CV; a playground, a test area for the director to experiment with green screen backgrounds and to kick back with people of whom he has previously worked.The little kid from the previous two films, who was never that interesting, here drives this entry; he is Juni Cortez, played by Daryl Sabara, and the film's first mistake is to promote him from the good foil that he was to his sister, played by Alexa Vega, to chief protagonist. After a lot of old nonsense at the death of Spy Kids 2, which encompassed his dismissal from the secret agent society within which his entire family operated, Juni is working as a ""gumshoe"" for private child clients whilst doing his best to solve other such conundrums like removing people's cats from trees. He walks down lonesome streets and arranges to meet in old theme parks devoid of activity; he is as empty and as desolate as these places look. A film along these lines revolving around Juni as a P.I. might have been good fun; Rodriguez would go on to explore such things in an as additionally-a post-modern way, and with the sorts of green screen effects put to use here, in his following project, Sin City.Unfortunately, we get all of about five minutes of the ""Juni the P.I."" movie; the film spiralling down an unrestrained and positively puerile path more broadly representative of Sabara's character propelling himself into a video game to encounter temperamental youths and duel with them. The catalyst for all this nonsense is the mysterious kidnapping of his sister, Carmen, and her consequent disappearance into this virtual-reality; a situation painfully set up by Salma Hayek's exposition – a role you can literally see Hayek having second thoughts about as the film wears on and her role gets gradually more plentiful. This video game alternate reality Juni must enter is apart of a broader network of video gaming franchising that has the world's child population hooked. However, there is something sordid and underhanded beneath its surface; a wicked individual at its heart running the thing named The Toymaker, who is an old enemy of Juni's ex-employers and is played here by Sylvestor Stallone - Often, one incarnation of Stallone is enough in a film; here, and because we begrudgingly get four of him.Prior to going in, Juni is additionally swept up in the wave of popularity this video game has on everyone – but would someone of Juni's life experiences thus far really be into such a juvenile thing? Rodriguez painstakingly inserts this central tract about how the one thing you think is all conquering and glamorous is actually somewhat flawed; additionally, there is a persistent coming back to how important it is not to cheat at games you play with people. The politics are in the right place, but anyone either elder than nine years old or looking for something a little more out of the film, is not. What the mission consists of, is a bunch of one-on-one duels with other gamers: there is a sword fight; an automobile race; a boxing match involving gigantic robots – none of it interesting, most of it capable of unfolding in any order you like and anybody who has seen 1982's TRON and doesn't think of it while they watch it just isn't trying hard enough. The film's end credits are particularly revealing, in that the project's lone laugh is a natural instance which rears up during shooting; the technical aspects behind the project, as Rodriguez et al. use the green screen and the machinery to recreate the virtual-reality world, look quite interesting – proving that the theory and technicalities behind such technology is inherently more interesting than anything people create with it. As the film dies its death during its Time Bandits-inspired finale, one character stops amidst the chaos as asks: ""Wait a minute, who won?"" Well, we in the audience certainly didn't.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

21,joiningjt,Phenomenal 3d and LOVED the cast and great story!! Read my review please!!,10,12 January 2021,"This movie did what I think mr Robert Rodriguez was trying to do, make you feel like you're actually in a video game and that's exactly what it felt like. I loved it, I felt like I entered a video game, the use of 3d was fantastic!! it accents the video game experience. If every film maker used 3d like mr Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron it would have stayed like it SHOULD have!! Personally I love 3d!! I purchased 3 3d TVs to make sure I can watch it for the next 20 years!! Its a absolute travesty that America didnt get it. The people who rate this lower than a 7 are way out of line and its 4.8 rating is an absolute error. Ive watched 100s of movies that received a 7 and they are FAR more inferior to this GREAT 3d film.

Almost like someone is making bets behind the curtain about whether or not they can get away with things.I'm the first person to get onboard with a ""stuck in a video game"" trope, but they made some really weird choices that offset it. The inclusion of big celebrities that kids won't recognize is a little odd, but the in your face 3-d stuff is irritating, and there were several forced scenes, and a conflicting message of competition vs cooperation.There are really high points of the movie: the story line itself is actually pretty good, the robot battle detour was actually a fun way to set up a call back, and there is a really good, if short, twist that I wouldn't expect in a kid's movie.The last act was a little too insane for me, but I'm thinks kids might like it.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
25,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over""- A frustratingly mediocre follow-up to the legitimately amusing franchise.",4,9 February 2017,"Robert Rodriguez is honestly one of the most frustrating figures in Hollywood that one could follow and be a fan of. From his humble beginnings as a low-budget action director on films like ""El Mariachi"", to the slick and stylish effects-extravaganzas like ""Sin City"", Rodriguez has proved time and again that he's a grand storyteller and a valuable member of the filmmaking community. Yet, for every major breakthrough he's played a part in, and for all of his remarkable high- quality releases that wow both critics and audiences alike... there's at least one if not not more significant and wince-inducing missteps that make you question your fandom. For every ""Desperado"", there's a ""Machete Kills""... For every ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", there's an ""Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl."" And for every ""Spy Kids"", there's unfortunately a film like ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over."" While I was never quite the target audience for Rodriguez's manic and wild kids-film series, I still could definitely not deny its imagination and creativity. The first two chapters, flawed though they may be, are fine and entertaining features that to this day still thrill and wow children the world over. The same could not be said of the third chapter. Released in the early 2000's when Rodriguez was experimenting with the new digital technology that would become a hallmark of his more recent work, ""Game Over"" is a frustratingly mediocre follow-up to two otherwise good films, and I think it's pretty clear what the problem is- Rodriguez doesn't really seem to treat this round of ""Spy Kids"" as anything more than a sophisticated tech-demo. It's not really a movie so much as it's an 80-minute experiment that our writer/director is using to test the bounds of green-screen filmmaking and low-cost visual effects. It's cold, methodical, clinical and frankly boring.Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has retired from the OSS and now lives a quiet life as a child private investigator. However, when he learns that his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) has been captured and is evidently imprisoned in the Beta of an upcoming virtual-reality video-game called ""Game Over"", he is forced back into action! He must infiltrate this new game- created by a dastardly villain called ""The Toymaker"" (Sylvester Stallone), to save his sister and perhaps the world once again! Along the way, he will encounter new friends and allies, and also call on the help of returning characters to stop The Toymaker's evil plans...Honestly, it's really hard to discuss the merits of the film because there's so little happening. Yeah, there's the shell of a plot and one or two minor beats of character establishment and development, but its only there to justify the constant and consistent sequences of green-screen ""action."" It's obvious that Rodriguez is simply using the film as a platform to play around with his new digital ""toys"", and the movie suffers for it. The actors appear lost in most of the scenes (presumably because they are, as they awkwardly walk around in front of a blank screen), and what little story there is comes off more like an afterthought than a focus. What makes it all the more confusing is that just a few years later, Rodriguez co-directed the excellent ""Sin City"", which similarly used a near-exclusive ""green screen studio"" approach, but it worked. Maybe his experience and mistakes with this film helped him to learn what to do and what not?Really, the only thing I can address is the quality of the effects and the nature of the action, and that is what just barely salvages the film. While the digital animation is pretty low-quality, it works as it was attempting to emulate video-games, so it gave it a sort-of appropriately-dated quality that I enjoyed. The action can be dull quite often, but a few sequences do adequate jobs at wowing the audience, so there's some fun to be had with the video-game concept. I also felt the early use of ""modern 3-D"" was charming, and while it mainly consists of throwing something in the audience's face every few minutes, it worked well enough. I might not be a fan of the old-fashioned Red/Cyan glasses approach, but the 3-D gave it a sense of kitschy fun. I also did enjoy the rampant cameos of characters from the previous films, and I think they'll likely delight young children.As it stands, ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" is a disappointing and forgettable sequel in the franchise, and won't likely win any new fans. Its just a series of loosely-connected CGI action set-pieces with a paper-thin plot to tie them together. But I think there's just enough dumb fun to be had with just enough key sequences that massive fans of the first two might wanna consider giving it a shot at least once. Everyone else need not apply, though.It gets a below-average 4 out of 10 from me.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
26,jeremycrimsonfox,The True Spy Kids Ending,6,4 April 2019,"I remember seeing this in theaters, and while the 3D was good at the time, I could see why it's not well received today. Spy Kids 3: Game Over is the third movie in the Spy Kids film series and was supposed to be the final film (until corporate greed kicked common sense out the building through a window and they made the garbage known as Spy Kids: All The Time In The World).In this film, Juni has gone solo after the events of the second film, becoming a private detective. However, he is called back to the OSS when he is told his sister, Carmen, is missing, and that it is because of a new game called ""Game Over"", which is actually a trap made by The Toymaker to enslave the mind's youth via mind control. With Carmen trapped and all trace of her lost, Juni must go in the game and save her and shut down the game.Yeah, it may not be perfect, the movie is mostly special effects, which by the year the film was released, has gotten to the point where it was being seen as a gimmick as much as the 3D effects, and it does have some strange characters (especially the characters in the game), but it has some good moments. While Sylvester Stallone got a Razzie for his performance, his role as The Toymaker was nice, as it basically added some story to the mythos (especially involving Juni's grandfather). Also, the ending was heartwarming, despite it flaws. This is another movie that may be flawed, but kids will love.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
27,TheNorthernMonkee,"after two good films, such a disappointment",2,31 March 2004,"SPOILERSIt seems strange that in a world so full of advancing technology that film creators return to such old styles. 3D Graphics are by no means a new concept, and so to use them after such a long time feels strange. I must confess here and now that I rented it on video rather than dvd. For some reason the video version didn't have any 3D quality to it and in a way I wonder whether this might have detracted from my enjoyment. When I say this, I mean it might have removed the one thing good about this film.In ""Spy Kids 3-D"", Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has left the spy world in disgust and is working as a private investigator. Upon learning of his sisters disappearance, he returns and enters a computer game in an attempt to find and save her.What can I say is good about this film? Well not too much I'm afraid. The plot and script are awful, which is a shame after the original two films were actually really entertaining. The film delivers cheesy line after cheesy line and seems to believe it can hide this simply by adding impressive special effects. The rudamentary family links are absent, as is Rudi's sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) for the majority of the film (only for her to turn up and grate on everybody's nerves). The list of cameo's as the end are good if for the fact that Steve Buschemi makes a reappearance, but ultimately they do feel like a marketting ploy. In fact, practically everything about this film is awful. I watched it with one of my housemates and we sat grimacing at certain parts which are so extreme it is ridiculous. The excessive moral points made throughout (but especially at the end) are predictable and irritating, and seem to be making up for a relatively small ammount in the first two films. To be honest, I think when my housemate said ""that's the worst film I've ever seen"", he probably wasn't far off. It might not be as bad as ""Crocodile Hunter"", which remains the only film I've ever been tempted to actually walk out of, but it was terrible. Truth be told, and the only reason I'm mentioning this is because I'll regret it if I don't, the only plus side with this film is how much it seems to ridicule the computer game industry. Certain characters in the game appear to be ""cool"" only to be revealed in real life as ""geeks"" and ""nerds"" with no lives, the different elements of the game owe slight digs at games involving lava, pod racing games (in reference to the scene in ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace""), and snowboard games. Sadly though, much as I like the idea of a film ridiculing computer game obsessives, not even that element of this film saves it from being an absolutely waste of time and money. I won't pretend to know whether a child would like this film or not, but after the first two, I doubt even they will feel particularly satisfied.

Now Stallone seems to be having a grand old time hamming it up in the bad guy role, and is such a hoot in this film that we forget that he really doesn't have a plan or a motive for being a bad guy,...

But he gets thrown back into the spy world, when his sister Carmen Cortez is kidnapped by the Toymaker. Carmen is trapped inside the Toymaker's video game, and the only way Juni can reach her is by going into the third dimensional world himself.After two successful films, the final Spy Kids movie goes 3D. Although it has a slight red and green tint on the screen, the actual effects used for it are quiet impressive and really provides the most fun for the film. Out of watching it in 3D or 2D, the preferred choice would be to watch it in 3D, as certain effects are too obvious in 2D. The process of going 3D is successful, but unfortunately, the film really fails on the story. The film is more of a chance to have 3D effects. It starts off OK, with a slight story appearing, but once you get to the last 30 minutes, it drops drastically. Instead of producing a fantastic ending, it just provides a chance to deliver cameos from nearly all the lead stars of the first two films. Even though it's a joy to see all these stars appearing, it is a really unnecessary move and does not give the proper ending it should have had.

32,christian123,The Spy Kids Franchise Ends On A Bad Note,2,7 July 2005,"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is a weak conclusion to the very entertaining Spy Kids franchise. Agents Juni and Carmen Cortez set out on their most mind-blowing mission yet: journeying inside the virtual reality world of a 3-D video game designed to outsmart them, as the awe-inspiring graphics and creatures of gaming come to real life. Relying on gadgetry, bravery, family bonds and lightning-quick reflexes, the Spy Kids must battle through tougher and tougher levels of the game in order to save the world from a power hungry villain. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution wasn't very good. I really don't have a problem with 3D but just because it is in 3D doesn't mean everything else has to be bad. The first two had good stories and were entertaining to watch. This one had a poor story and at times was too painful to watch. The acting took a drop from the previous film as most of the performances were bad. Sylvester Stallone did the worst out of everybody and I was wondering why he was even cast as his career is pretty much over. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play the two kids Juni and Carmen. In the first two, they give decent performances but, in this one they were awful. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino don't really appear in the film which is probably better for them. There are also a series of cameos including Salma Hayek and George Clooney. Robert Rodriguez does a rather bad job of directing as the film looks like a mess. The script is terrible and predictable. The ending is really bad as it just seemed like some cheap way to include everyone in the film. The entire film felt rushed and they should had spent more time on it. The 3D isn't even that impressive and they focused on that then more than anything else. The film is also not very enjoyable to watch. When the film isn't in 3D, it gets really boring and most of the dialog isn't very funny either. The special effects were cheesy and looked really bad. The running time was a brief 90 minutes yet that felt a lot longer with the dull story. There is just very little to like here and I think they blew it as they could had made a very successful franchise {in terms of quality not money making}. In the end, this is a poor film and its better if kids and adults alike just skip it. Rating 3/10",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
33,jamiedarlow-37510,My favourite of the Spy Kids series!,8,29 March 2020,"Juni must save his sister Carmen after she has been imprisoned by the latest villain on the block, The Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone). The catch is that she is trapped inside the Toymaker's video game and therefore Juni must transport into the video game and beat its 5 notoriously difficult levels to get to her and beat the game! I think what makes it my favourite is, on a personal level, it was the one I watched most as a kid and have more memories of. Also, the video game aesthetic was such a great idea for the Spy Kids franchise; it still holds up today and it's such a fun film to watch! It's definately Stallone's delightfully strangest performance yet; more testament to the fact that he is a really good actor and not just an action star! Everyone from the series makes a cameo at some point or another and makes for the warmest and coolest sequence in the film. There's even a brilliant cameo from Elijah Wood reuniting with the director from the Faculty days. Daryl Sabara gets to really shine here having the majority of screen time and is a central character we can really root for! I think Rodriguez really mastered playing on the spy-noir genre with pint-sized super agents which is showcased superbly in the opening which has ultra smooth music accompanying Sabara's awesome narration. The 3D technique is used to its full potential here as that was this episodes main marketing focus and it works really well in terms of their 3D gags translating even in 2D. Visually there are sequences such as the motor racing and lava surfing that are really exciting and the whole narrative is a loving tribute to video games from an innovative filmmaker",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

However, 'Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over' worked for me and I think it is mainly because it doesn't take itself that seriously. Somehow the artificiality of the first two films was nicely intertwined into the third film's plot here, and I found myself enjoying it quite a lot as we enter the virtual game world of the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone), where Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has to find his big sister Carmen (Alexa Vega). Add a few more players into this virtual game, and this adventure takes off.The 3-D aspect did not work for me, but regardless, I enjoyed this film and particularly Stallone's several alter egos in his Toymaker role. Richard Montalban features prominently as Grandfather in this movie, and has a bigger part as a character. He was quite effective! There are also some funny cameos too (a great one from Elijah Wood), and with the exception of the climax, which was over the top, this film is entertaining from start to finish.

37,stormhawk2021,A sad Tron-like attempt.,3,25 May 2017,"If Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is, in fact, the end of the Spy Kids movies, it's just about the most anti-climactic end to a series ever. Where the first two films were fun and enjoyable, Spy Kids 3-D is overbearing and obnoxious. The film makes the fatal mistake of utilizing 3-D technology that just doesn't work (it's those old red- and-blue glasses that should've been made obsolete in the '50s), and effectively infuriates those in the audience over the age of twelve.In a prologue that's mercifully not in 3-D, we learn that Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has abandoned the Spy Kid lifestyle in favor of detective work (he couldn't handle the pressure that comes with being a spy, apparently). But when his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) is kidnapped and held hostage inside a cheesy video game developed by the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone), Juni has to pick up where he left off and venture inside the game to save her.That simplistic storyline is a big part of why Spy Kids 3-D fails as horribly as it does. The teamwork aspect of the first two films, between Carmen and Juni, is almost completely absent here. And that was a big part of what made those films as entertaining as they were: the idea that this squabbling pair of siblings had to work together to solve a variety of complex and clever puzzles. Here, the majority of the film is akin to watching someone else play a video game, as Juni gets into car chases, fights robots, etc. With hardly a whiff of a plot to keep things moving, this becomes incredibly tedious almost immediately. While the special effects are admittedly quite impressive, they'd be more at home in an arcade.Surprisingly, Daryl Sabara (who's been one of the weaker actors of the series) really steps up and does a fairly decent job at carrying the film. And, Sylvester Stallone is especially good, playing multiple characters, and pulling off the comedy remarkably well. And the good thing was Salma Hayek, who appears with a white lab coat and her hair in two pigtails, à la Emma ""Baby Spice"" Bunton.And then, of course, there's the 3-D aspect of the movie. Every single moment of the film that takes place inside the game (which adds up to at least an hour of screen time), is presented using ""the very latest digital technology"" (or so says the press notes) of 3-D effects. But really, this is about as effective as those old William Castle movies of the '50s - and just as annoying. Seeing through these flimsy glasses proves to be the first major test, as the blue portion of the glasses seems to have been tinted a little too darkly. Even if you're able to see properly, you'll immediately notice that supposed 3-D objects barely appear to leave the screen. And it's not like the technology to create effective 3-D images doesn't exist; James Cameron's Ghosts of the Abyss did a superb job of immersing the audience in a realistic-seeming 3-D world. Fortunately, Rodriguez seems to have predicted that most people wouldn't be able to sit through an entire movie wearing the glasses, and the movie is watchable without them. Background images have primarily been ""enhanced,"" meaning it's actually preferable to view the flick without the aid of the glasses.Spy Kids 3-D will presumably fare a lot better on home video, where the 3-D effects will be removed from the film. But even if that's the case, you'll still have to sit through a terminally dull storyline that makes Tron look like Citizen Kane.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

And Spy Kids 3-D brings you into the experience - anything in 3-D is brilliant, but I found this an overwhelming cinematic experience with the 3-D glasses. This may explain why Spy Kids 3-D did well at the box office. Although, saying that, the only really good thing is the cinematic experience. This film does have substance enough to keep you watching through the whole thing, but there's no denying that it lacks on the intelligence and is once again, a predictable affair. And there's no character development either - didn't either of the Spy Kids learn anything from their encounters in the game? There really isn't much to warrant a DVD purchase - though you can still view it in 3D on the TV, a lot of the experience is lost in the translation.

By the third, the makers really needed something to get attract fans back to the theaters. Big mistake. The 3-D doesn't effect the film very much, and doesn't help the film very much either. So, what was so bad about it? I'll answer your question. It was the storyline. The story was way too spontaneous. There are many lines such as ""If you win, I'll get bonus points."" What are the points for? There's another scene where the main character enters a race. The other characters say he must enter it to get to the next level. Where did this race come from?

41,clydestuff,Four Tylenol and a couple of Dramamine later,5,14 March 2004,"It seems like every twenty years or so, people in Hollywood find it's necessary to dig out the 3-D process to entice a new generation of film goers. In the early eighties a 3D Film called Comin' At Ya made a surprising amount of money with the process.  Shortly thereafter we were subjected to such monstrosities as Jaws 3D, Amityville 3D, and Friday the 13th 3D. Just as quickly as the process had been revived however, it once again disappeared.  Hopefully, the latest reincarnations will soon suffer the same fate.Having made a nice tidy sum with the first two Spy Kids, Robert Rodriquez must have decided he needed a gimmick to get those fannies back into the theater seats one last time and decided to give us the Spy Kids in 3d. I'll give him credit for getting the little tykes back into the theater one last time, but as a film, Spy Kids 3D is as painful an experience as any adult might ever have to experience.  Story wise, script wise, and especially cinematography wise the film is one huge convoluted mess.
In this third outing, Juni has resigned from the O.S.S. to strike out on his own and make it rich, or at least rich enough to be able to play a new video game called Game Over.  When word is sent to Juni(Daryl Sabara) by President George Clooney that his sister, Carmen(Alexa Vega), has been trapped inside the video game, Juni rejoins the O.S.S. to save his sister.  It seems that once the game goes on line, the evil Toymaker(Sylvester Stallone) has it rigged so that once kids complete the mysterious level five they will be trapped in the game forever and he'll be able to control them.  So shortly after he arrives at the O.S.S., Juni or at least his subconscious is whisked away into a virtual reality game world.  Time to put your scarlet and cyan glasses on folks.Now I'm not normally one to quibble with small details in a movie obviously meant for the youngest of kids, but if I'm going to suffer a headache and queasy stomach for the sake of a film, I would like for the writer and director to at least connect the dots.  It is never explained with any satisfaction as to how getting inside the game with your subconscious really works.  It can't be a big O.S.S. secret because the game is filled with a whole boatload of other kids wondering around trying to achieve the same goal.  Add to this Juni's wheelchair bound grandfather(Ricardo Montalban), whom he summons into the game to help him out.  Conveniently, Grandfather quickly spouts legs so he can play right along, and watching Ricardo Montalban inside a video game is an unnerving experience.  Watch him closely though, as he'll mysteriously disappear when not needed and reappear just in time to help Juni and Carmen out of some sticky situations.  To make matters worse, as Juni bounces around the game world, any kind of logic as to what he must do and why he must do it is thrown out the window.  Every scene is nothing but a set up for Rodriquez to throw in what he hopes his audience will see as some cool 3d magic.  It doesn't take long for it to become tiresome, to your eyes, your head, and your stomach.If all this wasn't bad enough, the villainous Toymaker and his other personalities(all played by Stallone), controls the actions of the players inside the video game, then makes decisions that actually help them win it instead of having them figuring it out on their own.  So much for any kind of suspense.  Some of this is explained toward the end of the film, but by then we are so glad to see the film come to an end, we no longer care about his rationale or lack thereof.  Despite his razzie award winning performance, I did actually like Stallone's campy over the top performance. It's too bad the script doesn't give him anything to do that makes any sense.The funny thing about Spy Kids 3D, is that Rodriquez actually had a clever idea.  It's too bad he was so intent on making use of 3D that he forgot to make a good film in the process.  It is also hard to explain why he went back to using 3D that required the glasses with different color lenses. The effect was awful twenty years ago, twenty years before that, and in 2003 is even worse.  There seems to be some great computer generated backgrounds and sets in the film, but because of the silly glasses, you never get to appreciate them because they are muted and colorless.I'm sure the kiddies will be enthralled with this film and have fun wearing the funky glasses.  If you're an adult and you must watch it with them, a quick trip to the drug store for some aspirin and Dramamine would be advised.My grade D",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

And the parents were only in it for the last 5 minutes! But besides that, I really enjoyed this 3rd Spy Kid adventure!I heard that if this one does good enough, then there will be a 4th spy kids. I'm guessing that there will be because on the opening weekend, this got 34 million or something. And the 2nd week it was out, it got 21 million or something. So, there probably will be a 4th installment.Give it a break, people! 7/10PG; action and some perilious situations.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
43,I_Love_Spielberg,Eh....,5,25 May 2009,"""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" is the last installment of the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy directed by Robert Rodriguez about the two young spies who are sucked into a video game by an evil toymaker. Carmen is trapped by the toymaker, so it's up to Juni to save her. This movie was not one of Robert Rodriguez's greatest efforts, and I say that because the story was weak. I didn't like the ending either, I thought it ended a little too cheesy and corny. It was a great opportunity for Rodriguez to end the trilogy with something absolutely fantastic, but he instead ends it with a dud. But that's alright, he still saves himself with ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" Still, I wouldn't recommend seeing it, unless, of course, you have kids, which they'll absolutely enjoy it.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
44,TheMysteriousReviewer,The Title Says It All,3,11 November 2021,"Spy Kids 3: Game Over is a poorly made conclusion to Carmen and Juni's trilogy that contain its quality pretty low. The story mostly feels basic as a your typical rescue mission. The action went from being at least some that can be enjoyable in the previous two to being mostly dull. And the characters get uninteresting. But the biggest problem, most of the visuals. I do get that, it was the time 3-D was being developed as a new style. In fact, there are some that actually do work in others. This movie is not the case at all. Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, the visuals look almost unfinished. Full of unnecessary closeups and the effects are a joke. This feels it's more suitable for a video game than a legitimate film. You got five worlds, a series of battles, random minions attacking other players, and the final level with the big boss. But as a movie in general, it's just a low quality mess. The only ones I can see the need of watching are those that really like the Spy Kids franchise. Other than that, I recommend to just skip this one. There's a film that came out years later after this, Ready Player One. That film has something this movie wanted to do for a direction, but is actually much more enjoyable. The title says it all, it's a game over for this film.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

It starts well but the kids get excited when a new thrill comes into life but never realizes that they would be trying to solve a problem again but is worse. Juni never knew that his Carmen would be lost in the computer game named Game Over. She is held captive by the Master Villain the Game Master and he is asked to try finding Carmen before she is lost forever. Juni tries his best but he has difficulty trying has to get his parents involved to make it. Can Juni do it. Stay tuned to find out.

46,crowrobot,"While Rodriguez is clearly a gifted filmmaker, he lets the 3-D hamper his creative imagination....",7,6 April 2005,"Robert Rodriguez, director of the blood-soaked action movies ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", struck gold with his wildly inventive and creative ""Spy Kids"" in 2001. In 2002, ""Spy Kids 2"" was released, a worthy sequel, and now we arrive at ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"".I've never been much a fan of 3-D, but when it is done well (like at the Disney theme parks) I am quick to applaud. Not here; Rodriguez has gone back to the Stone Age of cinema and utilizes the red-and-blue 3-D glasses from the 1950's. As you can imagine, this doesn't work too well.Still, there is much fun to be had in the third and final installment of this super-cool franchise. The kid actors perform well, although for many of them this is their first movie. Ricardo Montalban returns in a greatly-expanded role as the grandfather, and through the use of CGI, Montalban (who is restricted to a wheelchair in both the movie and in life) gets to ""walk"" again (I will not spoil how). I also liked Sylvester Stallone as the Toymaker, the bad guy who, after spending a long time in cyberspace, has literally developed multiple personalities. Stallone is clearly having the time of his life as he hams it up as the wacky and colorful villain. Elijah Wood has a quick cameo, as do most of the adult cast members from the last two movies in the film's finale.The special effects are impressive, but they are once again hampered by the 3-D (thankfully, there is a 2-D version on the DVD).In short, while the 3-D didn't work for me, I still had a good time at this otherwise excellent family movie. 7/10",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

There was nothing wrong with the kids - no, this was a problem with Sylvester Stalone, and the plot. First off, starting the movie with a detective cliche is just...uninteresting. I was bored immediately. Secondly, while the video game world looked kind of cool, I sat there, just watching the tried and true video game ideas get horribly overdone. And instead of the mostly subtle family values message of the first movie, which was slightly less subtle the second, this one doesn't even try. The ideas are simply shoved down the throat, and...yeah. The whole ending sequence is bad. Sylvestor Stalone....should not be a kids' movie vilain.

48,TelevisionJunkie,The worst film of 2003... in painful 3-D,2,29 July 2003,"I know we're only a little over halfway through 2003, but this is without a doubt the worst film of the year.  Only once before have I hated a film so much that I felt cheated out of the money I spent to see it.  The first two SK films were clever child fodder that was entertaining enough to sustain an adult's attention.  However, this sorry excuse for a film was neither clever nor entertaining.  And it featured the WORST 3-D I've ever seen (even worse than ""Freddy's Dead"" -- I was unaware that was possible).  The paper thin premise has Daryl Sabara entering the video-game realm to find his trapped sister, Alexa Vega, and shut down the videogame, run by Sly Stallone. It's sad when Stallone was truly the best thing about the film (never thought I'd hear myself say that!).  The writing (if you could call it that) was droll and uninspired, the visuals were computerish and bland, and the story was non-existant.The film features 70 mins of headache-inducing 3-D that would make Alfred Hitchcock (Dial M for Murder) and Vincent Price (House of Wax) roll over in their graves. When I was a kid (which was not that terribly long ago, I'm 26), red-and-blue 3-D films were run on 2 projectors simultaneously.  In addition to adding depth to the film, it really did make things appear to pop out of the screen.  This film, however, was run on one projector, and while it did have depth, nothing popped out and the 3-D ruined the lush colors that it was filmed in.  With newer technology in 3-D projection, it REALLY bothers me that they didn't go with the gray-tinted glasses used in recent years -- geez, the 3-D episode of ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" looked like a Salvador Dali next to this 1-year-old-child's-painting.  I wasn't expecting a ""Captain-EO"" Disneyworld attraction but I did expect much better from what had been a classy set of kid's films.My final gripe is that Sabara received fourth billing when was the star of the film.  It wasn't until 9/10 of the way through that Vega shows up, and all of the ""stars"" from the previous films are reduced to an embarrassing cameo at the end.  The only stars who have major parts (which are still minor at that) are Stallone, Montalbon, Hayek and Judge.The only good thing I have to say is that it was interesting to see the screen-tests for Sabara and Vega that run after the credits are through (though I was the only one in the theatre who waited around long enough to see them).  Avoid this turkey til it comes out on video, where it'll probably play better in 2-D!",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
49,furiousneon,Very Well Done,10,25 July 2003,"I am not a fan of the Spy Kids Movies at all, as a matter of fact, i did dislike the first and second, but two things drew me to see the third film..the fact that it was in 3D and Sylvester Stallone.  I support anything the man does because hes great.  The 3D is wonderful and very pleasing to the eye..the action is good and its a fun movie..the best in the serious in my opinion and Stallone does absolutely awesome as the villain ""The Toymaker"", he brings some very funny humor the screen and goes all out showing that hes just having a great time doing what he does.

50,stiv-7,A fitting coda to a modestly well done series of films,6,21 August 2003,"There appears to be an overwhelming surge of hatred towards this film, which leads me to one conclusion: people went to see this for the wrong reasons. This is a family film, one geared specifically towards kids and parents who never really grew up. For the record, I thoroughly enjoyed this installment of the series; it's not the best of the bunch, but the 3rd installment is typically the weak link (can anyone say Return of the Jedi?)The setting of the film indeed owes a great debt to TRON, one that is repeatedly referenced in the dialogue and the action, and Rodriguez knew from the beginning that he would encounter resistance and problems with the red/blue process (watch Alan Cumming's intro to the film again, and you'll see what I mean), but the end product is a gorgeous piece of eye candy. It would've looked better in sequential field (IMAX) or polarised 3-D, but the market this film is aimed at isn't interested in spending the big bucks these processes require. The 3-D as it stands is amazingly effective (the mercury-like substance bouncing into the audience, the Mega Legs power-up in your face) and achieves great depth within its limitations.The performances widely vary, but this reflects the fact that the performers here are real kids, not the Hollywood brats we're used to seeing. Darryl Sabara was always the weaker of the Cortez siblings in terms of acting, but he's come a long way from the first film, and the film's revelation of the characters in the game being fantasy versions of their real-life counterparts was all too real and too funny.In short, this is a pleasant diversion that families can safely take their children to, with positive values that anyone can appreciate. When's the last time you saw a secular film that taught the importance of forgiveness without being preachy about it? If you can appreciate that little nugget, see this film.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

53,abrown975,"My eyes hurt horribly when I saw this movie. Oh yeah, and the 3D sucked too.",2,5 August 2010,"The only thing I hate more than an abomination of a movie is an abomination of a movie in 3D. So basically, you still get the abomination, except now you have random crap flying at your face at the same time. And this was back when theaters were using those annoying red-and-blue glasses that always made your eyes throb, so now it's an abomination with random crap flying at your face in variations of reds and blues that don't mix with each other. Wow, pass the popcorn. But don't think the graphics bombed because of the glasses. Even without the glasses, the graphics were pretty cheesy. Come on, the Tron/Speed Racer wannabe race practically smelt of cheddar. But we're just getting warmed up, because there's more! The acting reeked of inexperience, ironically coming from the cast who worked in the past Spy Kids movies, with a lot from those three weird players in the game and that girl in the purple suit. But the one who just stunk the most was the villain, who was played by Sylvester Stallone (What? Stallone acting badly? Whodathunkit?). But if that wasn't enough, Robert Rodriguez had to put in cameos of past characters at the end, which was kind of stupid because most of them didn't say anything or had anything to do with the movie. But everyone from the other movies had to come in for the absolutely boring and stupid ending so that the movie could stay true to the whole ""Family is Everything"" theme. But that just makes it so it's almost as if the characters just forgot what happened in the whole movie and everyone suddenly changed emotions and lived happily ever after. So, I guess all the mistakes have been covered, right? WRONG! The music sounded like it was played off a keyboard (it probably was), and that would be fine considering this is a movie about a video game, but it also had horns and violins that sounded so synthetic that it just screamed out ""We spent all the money on cheesy 3D graphics, so we had little to none left for the music!"" So, you name it, it sucked. Dialogue sucked. Acting sucked. Graphics sucked. 3D sucked. Ending sucked. Music sucked. But these are just examples of the thing that sucked the most: the directing. It was as if everything was thrown together with little effort. It certainly came off as if Robert Rodriguez thought that since people came to see the first two movies, he could just take a crap on green screen, put it in 3D, and people would come to see it. Well, in conclusion, this just a horrible film. The only things that are giving it a 2/10 are the cameos (even though they were just pointless) and the fact that the film at least had the decency to not put in any cheap fart/poop jokes. I really hope Mr. Rodriguez makes a better movie because I think he's a great director when he has the right chance or material (the same can be said for Mr. Stallone as an actor). But as for this movie, do not buy it, do not rent it, do not even watch it on TV if it's on. It is that bad.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
54,kalendra274,An exciting adventure for mostly little kids - see it in your 3-D glasses,8,30 July 2008,"Great movie, with lots of adventure in it and action also, which makes the movie worth seeing and enjoyable. It almost feels like your playing some sort of video game when your watching it - especially in the Mega Race - which makes you feel like your playing Grand Pix or Need or Speed or whatever on your Play Station. But to make it more enjoyable and more exciting is to put on your 3-D glasses. Trust me, the 3-D graphics were out-of-this-world and you feel like your in the movie, as for me, I borrowed the DVD from the library and it only had one pair of 3-D glasses inside the the DVD cover (it was supposed to have four, for the whole family but I guess someone lost or stole it and me and my sister had to take turns with the 3-D glasses - not fair!) and you have to say the special effects were out-of-this-world! Just amazing - the best achievement in this movie were the special effects...just outstanding graphics.The story follows ; Juni and Cameron Cortez who have been transfer in a virtual gaming world, which was made by the Toymaker and they're trapped, now they have no choice but to the play the game with tunes of levels such as, competing in the mega race, battling through boiling lava, fighting against warriors, even stronger then they ever imagined, to save the world from the evil Toymaker. As the levels get harder and harder, Juni and Cameron need all their strengths to battle it out against the levels.Alexa Vega (Cameron Cortez) and Daryl Sabara (Juni Cortez) did some fantastic performances, you can see that they put all there energy in their performances just to make the movie more realistic and enjoyable. Antonio Banderas (Gregorio Cortez) and Sylvester Stallstone (Toymaker) did some outstanding performances too, Antonio is an incredible actor and I've seen him in other movies too, such as ""Shrek 2"" and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" and you can see he put all his concentration in his role, which makes it fluent and realistic. As for, Sylvester, he shined throughout the movie with his funniness, so well done. Overall I thought all the performances by the cast were a phenomenon.The plot was well-thought out and solid from beginning to end, it did'not have too many characters or plots, which as we all know, makes the movie boring and confusing. And the writers tried so hard to keep the audience entertained with the movies twists and turns throughout and also I felt that the movie had lots of energy to act up in front of the audience and keep them captivated to watch more and more, so that was excellent as well.Overall, a spectacular movie, aimed for mostly children who loves video games and adventure, has a few twists and turns to keep the audience occupied.

55,-628,"Creative story, poor vision",7,8 January 2004,"Here is a creative story with excellent potential for 3D effects. Action inside a video game certainly allows director Robert Rodrigues to provide some unreal images and to hurtle many objects towards the audience. Throw in some innovative cameos by actors such as George Clooney, Bill Paxton and Elijah Wood (one toddler at my session excitedly called out, ""Look, it's Frodo!""), and there was a potential for a truly good movie here. 
How sad, then, that it faltered because of cheap 3D glasses which blurred some of the 3D action.  With the excellent 3D technology now available at places like Disneyworld (Orlando, Florida) and Sea World (Gold Coast, Australia), I thought that the world of 3D technology had come of age. However, the el cheapo cardboard glasses that were available for Spy Kids 3D were sub-standard and spoiled an otherwise quality movie.

56,eddy_currents,Oooo my eyes hurt... what was this about anyway?,5,9 August 2003,"For some stupid reason, the makers of this movie decided to use the ""old way"" of creating a 3D effect -- red and green glasses. The ""new way"" (which isn't all that new) uses polarized filters, which allows all the colors to get through to both eyes. This is what they use at IMAX films and amusement parks, and the 3D effect is amazing, even frightening sometimes. So, since the 3D part is such a big deal in this movie -- heck, it's in the title -- why didn't they use the ""good"" 3D method?I suppose the polarized glasses are more expensive? Given the fact they were guaranteed to make money with this sequel, they should have spent the extra money for decent glasses. About fifteen minutes into the 3D portion of the movie my eyes were sore. Another person I talked to had the same problem.But! Even worse than the physical pain we had to endure, the colored glasses give you a movie with muddy colors and fuzzy 3D effects.Since the plot and characters took a backseat to the 3D effects, this was a serious flaw. Just like in the old 3D movies that ruined the genre decades ago, there is something flying out at you at every opportunity, and it gets tiring in a hurry. Especially since the 3D effect didn't work... because of the crappy glasses.Plot? Not really. Mostly they fumble around in a video game, doing meaningless things. I suppose a video game tie-in is imminent?Grandpa comes along and flits in and out of the picture, and pulls our heroes out of trouble several times. Our heroes don't need to worry, Grandpa is there. Deus ex machina, anyone?The whole thing culminates in a grand and unbelievable battle, which I won't spoil for you in case you do want to see this. Suffice to say, puny humans toppling skyscaper-sized monsters with karate kicks doesn't work for me.Characters? Funny, I don't remember any. That's probably because they were cardboard cutouts with mediocre acting from the kids and overacting from the adults. Surprisingly, Stallone did a good job as the villain and made the only interesting character. Go figure.The whole cast from previous movies returns for cameos. Banderas has the only memorable scene in the movie.It's too bad. The first movie was terrific because it showed there is a market for good non-animated family films, and it was an entertaining fantasy. The second was good too, for the same reasons. This one is a muddy-colored plot-challenged eyesore.My kid enjoyed it though, even if he was rubbing at his eyes at the end like me.

I loved the original SPY KIDS - thought it was smart, hip and fun.  I was never bored, and the actors and action was great. 
Here we have the same great actors, but no script whatsoever.  So they have nothing to do!  And the 3-D?  It's the old anaglyph technology which uses red and blue lenses!  In the 80s they developed polarization 3-D technology which IMAX has perfected.  The red and blue lenses were used in the 50s, and now exclusively for TELEVISION viewing of 3-D movies.  I suppose this will make it cheaper to go to video and dvd down the road!  But it makes the colors HORRIBLE!  So not even the 3-D is going to save this one.

60,Spacetree,"Mr. Rodriguez, what happened?",2,9 May 2005,"I just don't understand. The first Spy Kids was fresh, original, imaginative and entertaining in almost every way. It was a great family and kid film, that (as cliché as it sounds) people of all ages could enjoy. Rob Rod really showed his range as a director. The child actors were charming, and the adult actors looked like they were having a good time making the film.And then there's this. Could a series really sour that fast? Heck, even SK 2, chock full of haphazard special effects and a hokey dance scene was better that this steaming pile.To put it simply, a good franchise was turned into a glitchy-vehicle for digital filming and 3D. The special effects were mediocre at best, the spark and charm of the first had been completely sucked out, and what was left a movie chock full of celebrity guest stars (who either chewed scenery with the ferocity of a lion like Stallone or were merely there like Banderas) with stuff flying of the screen at you (meaning that if you didn't see it in 3D, your left with television caliber special effects and Stallone eating a lounge chair).The kids were just as charming (well, Vega and Gugino were. The rest of them just stood around), so at least some quality from the first was still there.The plot was, well, pretty bad. I wasn't expecting The Godfather here, it's designed for kids. But, man, this was just annoying. Again, it was just a vehicle for the 3D gimmick; the plot leaped from A to H randomly and threw in Z for funsies: logic was effectively nonexistent. However, as haphazard as the plot was, the ending was truly horrendous. It was like RR just got bored with the movie and threw in robots and cameos at the end for kicks. All with sub-par CGI.After seeing at this film, I have a distinct feeling that the studio took away funding for the project and Rob Rod took over the whole production. But what I don't understand is the lapse in storytelling and quality. Obviously RR can effectively create good films flying solo: Look at Sin City and El Mariachi. So what happened? This was just one huge let down.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

62,Webslinger48,Much better on video than in the theater,6,28 December 2005,"First off, let me start by saying that I own all three Spy Kids movies and although I'm an adult male with no kids, I've seen the first one probably 5 times and the second one thrice...so I'm not a typical Spy Kids fan. However, I am a big fan of Robert Rodriguez and his maverick style of film-making, as well as his films (particularly the Desperado films, which are about as opposite from Spy Kids as you can get). Also, his DVD's are always loaded with tons of extras including commentary, behind the scenes footage, his ""10-minute Film School"" videos and other material. So his films are always worth the DVD purchase.Aside from writing and directing his films, Rodriguez is also the cinematographer, editor, production designer, visual effects supervisor and producer. Oh yeah, and HE ALSO WRITES THE MUSIC!!! Because his films are made on ultra-tight budgets yet always reap massive box office, he enjoys creative freedom unheard of to anyone in the motion picture business not named George Lucas. That's how he was able to make a 3-D film for kids.So what's the verdict? Well, when I first saw Spy Kids 3-D in the theater I was definitely underwhelmed. Perhaps I was sitting too close to the screen or maybe the picture was out of focus, but more than anything the 3-D gave me a headache and frequently I had to remove the glasses to give my eyes a rest.But a funny thing happened when I watched it again on DVD...IT WAS LIKE SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME! Thanks to the sharpness of DVD (they actually recommend you watch it on a computer monitor, which is higher quality), the 3-D effect was awesome! In fact, after watching it I put in Spy Kids 2, and that movie immediately seemed weak in comparison to the dynamic 3-D effect of the third movie.Now some reviewers here have complained about the story, and they are right, it lacks the charm and wit of the other Spy Kids films. However, as Rodriguez mentions in the commentary on the disc, this is largely due to the fact that it originally was not going to be a Spy Kids film...He set out to make a 3-D film for kids that would progress like a video game, and decided later to shoehorn that plot into a Spy Kids film.

Spy Kids 3 made me feel more like a child than almost any film this summer (notable exceptions:  XMen 2 and the blatant nudity from Freddy vs. Jason... which reverted me to a 12 year old in seconds)  It's more than worth a rental... if it includes the 3-D glasses.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

I like being able to see every awful flick that comes through for free so that I can analyze and understand film, or something that I have conned myself into believing. I knew that the script and plot would be awful, but really what else can you expect from a 3-D movie. They're too busy making sure that someone's hand is sticking out, brushing the audience...or that some old man is playing with a butterfly on the moon. The funniest part were the scientists trying to explain the plot holes created by a hastily thrown together script to make a quick buck. Actually, I got some good thoughts going after I took off the glasses for a little rest about ten minutes after I had them on. I realize that some movies, or films, are made for the sake of art. Some are made for awards. Some are made for money. This is one of those movies made strictly for money. The studio knows that if they advertise and create a 3-D movie, kids will whine and beg and kick and scream until their parents drag them to it and not only do you get the money from the children's admission, but you get a slightly higher paying adult that gets forced through this. This one hurt to watch, seriously, my eyes were in pain. They still hurt a little. And my head is still spinning on the fact that this was number one at the box office and that people are suckers. ""Seabiscuit"" opened this weekend, why didn't the parents take their kids to that! A great family film that one was, in Yoda speak. Alright, so basically, the studio threw together a crappy flick and greased the 3-D hole until it could be greased no more.

Spy Kids 3 had probably less than fifteen minutes with the whole family. The plot was almost fresh, but old plot elements ruined it. The special effects were actually rather cheesy, and the acting somewhat less than satisfactory (a plot surrounding Carmen instead of Juni would have been better, since Alexa Vega is much better at acting than Daryl Sabara).The former two films poked fun at other films in ways that made viewers laugh out loud. I don't remember laughing at all during Spy Kids 3, and not because it was neccessarily more serious than the first two.As I said, the family as a whole gets probably less than fifteen minutes, while Daryl Sabara is on screen almost non-stop (by the end of the movie, you're begging for relief from his terrible acting). The cameos by Bill Paxton, George Clooney, Elijah Wood, and others are rendered stupid and pointless by the rest of the movie (though Elijah Wood's cameo was almost good enough to excuse the whole film.

71,georg_gruber,"Zeitgeist, Baby!",7,17 February 2004,"Spy KIDS 3-D is like most contemporary video games: pretty to look at, a little short to play, based on traditional game-play, with self-humor and leaves you with the feeling ""I want more for my money"".Yeah, the story is cheesy. Incredibly cheesy. Whatever! Few enjoyed TRON way back then - few can enjoy Spy KIDS 3-D now. This is the first movie in years (probably since TRON) that catches the Zeitgeist of our time: Video Games! I spotted many references to our society where kids grow up - not only with the TV-set but increasingly with interactive video games. Since the 1980s video games have become a great influence of our culture - this movie pays tribute to this development.I like the first Spy Kids movie, the second one is my favorite and the third part is a mixed bag. Take the 3-D aspect: some people say the movie is boring because it is not as interactive as video games are. What's that supposed to mean? When was the last time a movie motivated you to put on and off funny looking little 3-D paper classes? That's what I call inter-active. Finally the movie made a lot of fun of video games: take the great ride with the bikes for example: looks like a parody of F-ZERO.The strongest point of Sky KIDS 3-D is the innovation of actually bringing back 3-D in cinemas. This is a real achievement. The producers had to master technical problems, came up with a simple and wonderful solution and made the movie experience fresh once again. The little 3-D paper glasses worked just fine and some scenes in the movie really look fantastic.The only thing that turned me off was that the movie was too short - and most of the story and other actors were cut out of the movie. And it was not as funny as Spy KIDS and the Island of Lost Dreams.This movie isn't intended for the parents or adults, its target group is the children.

72,trixtium,A Perfect Movie except for the eyestrain,7,26 July 2003,"*MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS*For me, the Spy Kids franchise has been a welcome change from the typical consumer pop-culture tv-adaptation trash churned out for children today (e.g. Lizzie McGuire Movie, the Rugrats and Thornberry movies, and the Pokemon movies) with films that have managed to ignite the senses and entertain all ages while avoiding cookie-cutter plots and blatant commercialism, problems all too common among today's Hollywood flicks.Spy Kids 3-D is, by far, the most energetic of the three movies, with fast-paced action that doesn't let up until the credits fly at you, 3-D style. It pays homage to a variety of films, such as Blade Runner and Tron, yet is able to stand on its own, despite similarities to the latter. It never takes itself too seriously, and, when shrapnel isn't flying at you or the breathtaking visuals aren't distracting your eye, the witty, throw-away dialogue will have you doubled back in laughter (or at least emitting a chuckle or two). The plot is intentionally shallow but plenty of fun, steering clear of Hollywood cliches (except when it is busy making fun of them) and the pretention that underlies most films meant for children. SK3D feels like it is the brainchild of a child, and is all the better because of it.SK3D's fun factor is off the scales, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys plenty of action and adventure with a good dose of humor tossed in. The only problem I had with the movie was the eyestrain one gets from wearing those tinted glasses for an extended period of time. But then again, I was in a really crappy seat when I viewed this, so perhaps it's just me.P.S. Though SK3D is essentially a film about a video game, throughout the movie Rodriguez quietly presents the message that video games can never take the place of real life, something that may not be lost by the techno-happy children that will probably be attending this flick.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
73,hamilton-3,Vision vs. Presentation (How to Enjoy a 3D Movie),9,2 September 2003,"This movie continues the family-oriented Spy Kids series, which are exemplified by Robert Rodriguez's exuberant visual style, along with heavy doses of tongue-in-cheek humor and a consistent grounding in positive values, especially mutual support within one's family.  ""Spy Kids 3"" is a fine addition to this highly entertaining series.Why is the IMDB rating so depressed then?  A lot of people (18%) gave it the lowest rating of ""1"".  I guess that some people react very negatively toward the stereoscopic presentation, which employs blue/red color filtration (anaglyphic system) to deliver to each eye its particular view of things. This mode of presentation makes sense for general distribution in a wide variety of theatres where the technical requirements of polarized 3D could not be reliably delivered.  Also, the packed theatres during the first couple of weeks of release pretty much guaranteed bad viewing aspects for a good portion of the audience.  And then, others have unreal expectations of the 3D presentation.Here's my advice for enjoying this movie:(1) Don't sit so close!  Sit in the back half of the theatre and toward the center if possible.  Some people incorrectly assume that sitting closer will enhance the 3D effect.  Instead, they force their eye muscles to try to do nearly impossible tricks.  Typical result of such strain might be a headache.(2) Don't expect the same result you may have seen in special theatres such as Omni or Imax where the polarized system allows true color registration and audience distance from the screen is more controlled.  The anaglyphic system does cause loss of photorealism and present odd conflicts between the eyes.  Try to accept this limitation as the price of the 3D effect. (Hopefully before too long, we will also see a version of this film released in polarized format at theatres which specialize in such presentations.)(3) Accept strangeness.  A 3D movie is not like real vision. We see the real world in 3D, but we use focus to filter out details that are not what we are directly looking at.  In a movie everything is typically in focus at the same time. Also, in such a movie as this, which relies on composited elements, there will be some mistakes in the combining of the images.  For example, at one point, we are on the moon, and the distant Earth hovers in front of the horizon!  At other times, characters appear to stand above or below the surfaces they should be walking on.  Though only occasional, these errors do distract, and I hope that future releases of this movie might adjust the composition to correct these errors.Some people complain that the 3D effects are not extreme enough, but they overestimate the possibilities on the medium.  This movie is exemplary in its well-constructed execution of stereoscopic 3D.My overall verdict: a worthy conclusion to the Spy Kids series.  Great visual style and panache, funny references to the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings, positive values without preachiness.  Extra point for the best theatrical 3D since ""Dial M for Murder"".

The man seems to have no limits to his imagination, and it shows in this film. I sat in a packed cinema, and not one single person walked out of it un-happy. The film will not win awards, nor will it stand out as a major point in anyones career. It simply did it's job, and that was to entertain.To be honest, i think the film would have benefitted if it was not is '3-d'. Not only was the gimmick a distraction, it was also quite uncomfortable. I found myself turning away from the film on several occasions to rest my eyes. Only on a few occasions, did the 3-D actually work, most times it simply seemed to blur and look poop.The story is something that, as in most Rodriguez films, just takes a back seat to everything else. By the end of the film, you actually could not care less about the story. In fact, Rodriquez himself seems to through everything out of the window and end the film in the way he saw fit on that particular day of shooting. WARNING! If you have no imagination, or are'nt willing to let go of reality, then don't watch this film.There are some fantastic cameos from the Rodriquez 'family'. He even brigns in a certain member from The Faculty cast. I think the only member of the 'family' missing is Tarantino.This is deffinately one for fans of Rodriquez the kid and fans of the first two spy kid films inparticular.

There are newer, more advanced forms of 3-D entertainment, but director Rodriguez decided to go with the old fashioned 1950s variety - resulting in a virtually colorless mess of hazy images rushing past the audience's confused, aching eyes for an hour and a half. If they release a non-3-D version on DVD, wait for that and enjoy what little screen time was given to Ricardo Montelban, who steals what little entertainment value this stinker manages.

The racing scene is especially reminiscent of the original video game movie TRON.But the movie is hurt by the use of 3-D.  Putting the audience inside of game might have looked good on paper.  Unfortunately, the process still has not been perfected.  Stereo-optic viewing is best in short stretches, but there is little time to adjust in this film.The story is uneven.  The script starts out strong, with Junie (Daryl Sabara)called back into service to stop the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) from enslaving the world's children with a video game.  As long as the action stays in the game, the story is plausible.  But the ending is sunk by the bringing back all the rest of the characters of the franchise: Dad, Mom, Grandma, and all the rest of players of the first two films.

Lots of gimmicks, not much plot or character -- which also easily makes this Spy Kids the most disappointing of them all, in a way. *HOWEVER*, if you can get past Syl Stallone's non-emoting as the bad guy, the fact that Alexa Vega is barely involved, and ignore the muddled plot (which is there only to get you to the next 3D set piece anyway), then you're in for a real treat. The 3D, for the most part, looks *amazing*. And, again, Robbie R. has done a fantastic job of encapsulating the cheesiness of the bygone era of '50s 3D film, in a strangely pleasant and compelling way.Overall, this was much more fun than the Matrix sequel despite its warts. Hope the series really does die here, because its really starting to show its seams.  That said, it's a not bad way for an adult to spend 90 minutes.

86,sjjsp3,One spy kids too many.,5,13 March 2005,"Don't ask me how I ended up watching all three spy kids movies (little cousins is my story, and i'm sticking to it!!) but they went too far with this one.I enjoyed number 1, where the concept was fairly outlandish and the characters added to the fun of it all. Number 2 I have mixed feelings about. An older Vega (Carmen) and Sabara (Juni) seemed to come into their role more than 1, but the film lacked the punch of the first. Number 3- oh dear.Before I start, I'm going to give Robert Rodriguez some credit on three scores. (1) He takes technological risks (high percentage of green screen, HD film, 3D) that many film directors either would try or haven't quite discovered. (2) His loyalty to actors such as Banderas, Gugino, Clooney etc, is commendable in an industry that constantly recycles and trades in talent for newer, fitter, funnier, sexier. (3) He has a strong sense of moral value in trying to encourage kids to stick by and look to their families, which i thought was commendable.Commendation over. First, we'll give them the fact that it was deemed necessary for Juni to enter the game world. But many things didn't work in the film (the life scoring system, for one) that computer game players of even the weirdest fantasy game would know happens in computer games. Second, the ridiculous cameo's. I let them off with Clooney twice. But Clooney isn't the issue. Salma Hayek (Donnagon's wife)? Sly Stallone (Toymaker and about another three or four sub characters)? You know it's bad for Hayek if she's not in the credits (unless i missed that). Why? What did either cameo add to the film? Third, the plot. What plot? Kid goes in game, somehow saves earth too. If i wasn't so lost by the amount of subplot, i would have found it predictable. Four, lack of ending (my favourite hang-up). That was slightly unpredictable, but doesn't end up in total banishment of bad guy, which begs the question ""was there a real purpose to what preceded this moment?"" I don't think so at all. Five, the filmmakers took away performance from two of the actresses that made the first two films half decent- Vega and Gugino. Not only was there no discernible reason for omitting them from most of the film, but they cut the two most believable characters out of what was, at best, a workable concept.( and that's at best.) Lastly, Whereas Spy Kids 1 followed Spy Kids 2 in a logical order, Spy Kids 3 seemed way off the scale and didn't connect properly.But the main thing is, my cousins liked it, right? Interesting questions- Will Rodriguez try this genre again with a new concept? Will Vega try her hand at a J.Lo style singer/actress career with any success? Will Hayek land another big role in the future? Will filmmakers ever realise that too many sequels spoil the industry? Worryingly, i fear all the answers may end in ""No"".",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

The 2nd one was ok, getting a little worse, and as the tagline says, ""Slightly Bigger Spies."" This was just plain out stupid for several reasons. The really only person that came from the last 2 throughout the whole movie was Daryl Sabara aka Juni Cortez. Alexa Vega aka Carmen Cortez was in the last 20 minutes or so, and was sleeping most of the movie away. Ricardo Montalban aka Grandfather was in the last one and probably had the 2nd most screen time.The idea of Spy Kids is starting to really unoriginal and not new especially since they keep pumping a movie out once a year. Think about Star Wars, their movies come out once every 3 years, James Bond, once every 2 or 3 years. As Rater #2 says perfectly, they're preteens now or in Alexa's case, she is a teen.The 3-D aspect of the film bothered me. I didn't like wearing the glasses because a) They're not like the ones at Disney World and Universal being the same color, and b) They were blue and red, which distorted my field of vision. I don't have glasses (contacts instead), so that didn't really bother me. The thing was I couldn't see any 3-D effects. Maybe there's something wrong with my vision, but 3/4 people I was with said they couldn't see any effects at all. Most of the stuff flying at us were nuts and bolts. I didn't hear anyone gasp when something was flying at me.Daryl did an ok job as his part. I think he was better in the first movie, but this movie was directed more around him. Alexa didn't really do much, as she was sleeping most of the movie. I loved Stallone's Rocky movies, but I swear that I didn't recognize him at all in this one. The rest of the cast was put it for 2 seconds worth and it was a rather waste of money and time. They were on for 2 seconds. Just 1 dumb question, why was Elijah Wood in here serving up 2 minutes of screen time? Why? Though I thought it was funny when he got killed. I'm the Guy, zap! 99 lives down to .5, uh oh, 0. Bye bye.

1 last thing.  Why were all the bad guys good in this one?  I thought they all went to jail or something.Well, besides blowing $8.50 on a movie that I really didn't exactly want to see, I think it was probably, for the most part wasted. 6/10's of it was at least.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
90,crwilley,Half a good movie,5,6 November 2003,"I think I'm glad this is the last in the series.I enjoyed about half the movie - that half being the ""eye candy"" of the special effects in the action sequences, particularly the hoverbike and mech wrestling. I got a giggle out of the Tetris pieces used to make platforms, and out of how much one of the actresses resembled the artwork for the heroine of every one of the Final Fantasy video games...kind of appropriate.The child actors were, in general, surprisingly watchable - I would've liked to have seen more of Alexa Vega in the film, honestly - and Ricardo Montalban and Sylvester Stallone were well matched against each other. They had to be, really, because despite top billing for Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, they were barely on screen long enough to be noticed.
But the eye candy and the generally good acting couldn't make up for the overall level of stinky, stinky CHEESE that makes up the bulk of the film. I had the feeling that a couple big chunks of the film were missing - some exposition at the beginning would have been nice, and the resolution of the ""video game"" part of the movie felt very, very rushed. The video game plotdevice itself is...umm...let's say it overloaded my disbelief suspender, and the overall tone of the movie was beyond absurd, a real disappointment in light of the first movie in the franchise. And the final scene seemed to just be an excuse to get every adult who'd ever gotten camera time in the first two films another 15 seconds in front of the camera.My five-year-old loved it, of course, but I wish we'd waited to see it in second run.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

The third installment is about 85% as good as the second, but the 3D makes your eyes tired. (Which they allude to in the movie!) I must give it to Robert Rodriguez for not making a movie that was soley a 3D gimmick, this movie should still have 75-80% of its appeal on DVD.But...the series is slipping into the ""not-quite-right-for film"" script syndrome. This movie felt like a long saturday morning show. Maybe like a TV movie, the ones based on a current series. Not because of the effects, but because it comes off like a rushed production. After all, Robert is making one of these a year.Which is fine..he will continue to get my money multiple times at the theaters. Just don't let them slip past this level Robert and go stinko ala Austin Powers.As far as the movie..well Juni is my favorite character and the film is about him and a bit about grandpa. So I was interested. Stallone is a stinker of an actor, even at this campy, tongue in cheek level. He is actually better as an actor in DRIVEN then here. Go figure.My biggest complaint: is it really necessary to show EVERY single character in EVERY single movie? Yes I love continuity, but the last 20 minutes felt like a rush to get everyone in the movie, even if we did not see them do anything.....Last but not least, Salma Hayek looks like a doll in this flick.

But some of the humor is pretty good and the game world was created nicely. Also, this is a kid movie with a good theme. In addition to the old theme, 'its all about the family', this one actually takes on another theme that no matter what you look like or if you are handicapped (Juni's Grandpa), what matters the most is what's inside and kids need to learn that.I do agree that 3D glasses were awful.

This film is made up of loads of film stars in people like Antonio Banderas and Ricardo Montalban but what really got me was how much this film relied on cameos to keep entertainment value going. Elijah Wood , Steve Buscemi , Salma Hayek , Tony Shalhoub , George Clooney and eeerrrr......... that weird guy who plays floop. Anyway the plot of this film is an evil villain called the toymaker is .. i think he was trying to take over the world ... this film was hard to follow. Anyway these people go into virtual reality and try to stop him. It results in the biggest pile of nonsense since rio ferdinand tried to explain missing a drugs test.

THOU HATH BEEN WARNED!*I know it's habit for Hollywood big-wigs to get into the recycling business. After all, it helps the environment, and gives said big-wigs great public rep for Doing Their Part.  However, I cannot fail to notice how many cliches this allegded movie ripped off from better features out there.  (Cowardly young protagonist who achieves success by luck or via the actions of others, said protagonist doesn't want anything to do with former affiliation, bullying opposition who somehow realizes the protagonist is not such a bad guy, tacked-on love interest, etc.)Even an hour after watching this dreck, I still am debating the worst part of this movie:(1) The fact that the featured stars (Antonio Banderas and whoever played the mother) were only figured into the plot during the final fifteen minutes;(2) The story revolved around a whiny pre-teen boy who never gave us a reason to care about his cowardly demeanor - Alexa Vega's character would have been a much better lead considering Carmen Ortega oozes 10x more self-confidence and courage than Juni;(3) The last fifteen minutes made no sense and was akin to watching a train wreck - various people out of nowhere come to assist the Ortega clan against the chief antagonist;(4) Said last fifteen minutes came to an abrupt, hokey resolution.(5) Apparently, even children don't know which part of the movie is ""three-dimensional"" or not - no, we have to be reminded at the start of and during the movie to have our GLASSES ON or GLASSES OFF.  I know movie producers mistake the public for idiots, but I never thought the producers could be THIS condescending.A few good things about the movie:(1) Ricardo Montablan and Sylvester Stallone did their best with what was given and gave perfectly acceptable performances in their given role;(2) Good message about spending too much time in front of a video game versus experiencing real life and being with family - this was the main reason why I did not vote SK3 a 1.(3) It was only 75 minutes long.Unfortunately, the crap outweighs the message being sent.  There are better movies that could either give the same family-friendly message (Disney's PIXAR movies come to mind) or allow the viewer to vicariously view life inside a machine (TRON).3 out of 10.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

This type of 3D is simply a pain to watch; I got a headache after about 10 minutes, and my daughter actually got motion sickness.Unless you are a young boy or a video game enthusiast, this film is also quite boring until the end.  The plot involves young Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) going ""inside"" a video game (an idea done to death with such films as ""Tron"") to rescue his sister.  Although Sabara and other child actors deliver fine performances, the video game adventure is far too long and gets very dull.  The only amusing moments occur at near the conclusion of the film, when several fine adult actors (Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton, George Clooney, and others) make very brief but funny appearances, including a laugh-out-loud joke from Ricardo Montalban that refers to his old car commercials.I cannot recommend this film to anyone, as the 3D is too poorly done and too irritating to watch.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

I bought my ticket not expecting a good plot but at least expecting decent special effect and a 3 Dimensional experience.The special effects were crappy- The movie would have been better if they either had just shown the green screen instead of the virtual world or if the grandfather had died.  I think the producer's objective was to dig into the Hollywood Actor Welfare Hat and pull out the names of several really poor actors.Defining moment: when the theater had to call an ambulance for me after I slobbered onto the floor from a seizure induced by probably some of the crappiest, blurriest special effects I have ever seen.

The film  would have worked quite well without the 3-D thing but of course the film-makers were all waiting to get to the 3rd movie to make it 3-D. It all fitted perfectly with the title! Also, it was a pain because you couldn't take your glasses off and watch the film at the same time because then you'd be seeing double of everything on the screen!!! I really do wonder how they're going to bring it out on video & DVD. It would spoil the whole collection if they just didn't bring it out at all! It would,of course, still be a great family film to watch without the 3-D affect. Overall, a good film to watch but it will never beat that IMAX Cinema feeling!

Well, to be fair, it's not Sylvester Stallone's fault.  The real culprit here is the absolute WORST screenplay ever written.  I liked the original ""Spy Kids,"" but in this movie, I couldn't care less about these characters. Their lines are riddled with cliches,  their interactions and reactions are disingenuous, and the few plot twists this movie offers all seem like sudden after-thoughts.This movie is all about computerized special effects backgrounds, live-capture animation, and would make a great videocard demo program ... for about a minute.

I credit Robert Rodriguez for keeping the cast and the film light, and for using the 3D effects usefully but I do say that he does go over board in certain scenes in the movie. The film also gives too many of the same messages that we already said in the first two but considering that this is a family film, i don't mind it too much.

This one, however, turned out to be just fine for me, even though they have the same type of gadgets, but this time they are in a video game, which makes the film more believable.Some of the high-speed special effects appeared more video-gamey than real life, but that was also acceptable because it is a video game. Ideas from Star Wars Episode I Racer video game and Danny Kaye's The Inspector General (1949) made it very amusing, and seeing Elijah Wood for a few hilarious moments was a plus It also showcased the acting talents of Ricardo Montalban, Sylvester Stallone and George Clooney, who are normally known more as action heroes than good actors.

SK and SK2 were a pair of rare movies where kids and parents could sit together and both be glad they came.Spy Kids 3D is a horrible, wretched waste of celluloid that is a betrayal to the fans and nothing more than a cheap ploy to exploit a successful, quality series for a pile of cash.  Despite the fact that the movie is in ""3D"" (gee, I seem to remember seeing pictures of people wearing 3D glasses in the '50's), the production values are terrible and the plot is basically non-existent.  The cheap 3D glasses will give you a headache and blur the film more than they provide a unique viewing experience.The basic plot is this: Juni Cortez, played by Daryl Sabara (apparently the only original cast member willing to invest more than 15 minutes in the creation of this dreck) jumps into a video game to save his sister. He takes Grandpa with him.That's about it.  There are so many plot holes and logical dead ends that in the end, just face the fact that since this is a formula movie, the good guys will win after an hour or so of headache-inducing semi-animated action.In the end, we see about a minute each of the remaining cast members from the previous movies.  Their presence is barely explained, and their contribution to the climax is questionable (after each gets his/her cameo, they're pretty much out of the rest of the movie).Finally, I do have to say that my seven-year-old was enthralled and probably would have given the movie a 10.

Although the special effects were quite good, the rest of the movie was worthless.  The plot was shallow and disjointed.  It was almost as if someone sketched out an outline of what they wanted the story to be and filmed - forgetting to add the meat in between. You never really knew (nor did the characters) what they were doing or why.The story starts with Juni doing his own thing - no longer part of the spy network.  (What happened to working together as a family?)  Then he gets talked into coming back to the OSS to save his sister, who's mind has been trapped in a computer game.  To save her, Juni has to enter the game and win his way through to the 4th level to free her.  Once he gets inside, he is allowed to have one family member come in to help him and he picks grandpa (Ricardo Mantalban).  Unfortunately, Juni really has no idea what he is supposed to do.  And it's grandpa who keeps appearing at the last moment to help him out of the jams.  Unfortunately, Juni never is enlightened - nor is the audience.  Then, instead of actually being creative, they end the whole mess with a grand finale by bringing in every character they could from the first two movies.  It just didn't make any sense!To be fair, I have to say that the actors did try.  The had energy and really tried to make it work but it's really hard to work with something that just isn't there!

This movie employed the tired red/blue glasses which were offered for the Creature from the Black Lagoon made in 1954.  The effect was minimal at best, the colors were washed out, my left eye (red) was much darker than my right eye, and I kept lifting my glasses to see if there was any difference.  There was little, the most being without the glasses the colors were much better even though the images had little blue and red halos around them.  Overall, the effect was anoying and headache promoting.Beyond that, the movie was barely passable.  Only the son had a real part in the movie.

Stallone is great?! What? Many reviews have said this and my response is remember ""Oscar""? Of course you don't because Stallone can't do comedy, shouldn't even try, he's an embarrassment to himself. I can't believe this man ever WON an Oscar. Really this movie is all about Juni, and everyone else has a cameo, his parents,his sister, George Cloony, etc they are all cameos. Why? I believe the other actors (except for Juni and Stallone) were too embarrassed to do more but must have been forced by contract to appear.

With the help of his grandfather Valentin (Ricardo Montalban), three beta testers (who think Juni is ""The Guy"" described in the users' manual who can take you to Level 5 of the game if you stick with him), and a somewhat mysterious girl named Demetra (Courtney Jines), Juni succeeds in rescuing Carmen and reaching Level 5, where everyone may end up trapped by the Toymaker.  Ultimately, of course, Juni and Carmen save the day, and all is right with the world, even if there isn't a winner or a loser.The movie actually works very well until the characters exit the video game, although it is a little reminiscent of ""Tron.""  Despite Roger Ebert's much-publicized aversion to 3D, the gaming scenes are quite impressive, without the ""headaches"" that used to come from old-style 3D.  Kudos to James Cameron for the new 3D system.  Also, Rodriguez does a great job pulling good performances from actors stuck on the artificial blank backgrounds of the 3D soundstage.  His video game sequences capture the gaming feel without getting bogged down in game details -- and contain plenty of action as well. Oh, and his special effects look great, as usual.Unfortunately, it feels as if Rodriguez only wrote enough movie to get the characters into Level 5 and then ran out of time, energy, money or willpower to give them the ending that they deserved.  Instead, he tacks on a nonsensical ending that gives him a chance to get cameos from most of the stars of the first two films, including Carmen and Juni's parents, but brings the movie to a disappointing conclusion better reserved for Saturday-morning TV.Daryl Sabara does a decent job of carrying the film, but the surprise of the movie is Courtney Jines.  My daughter, who saw the movie before I did, came home raving about the girl Juni meets, and I understood her reaction when I saw the movie myself.  Alexa Vega is only in a small portion, but she does get to sing two songs in the extended end credits.  One small treat: if you stay to the very end, after the neverending credits, you get to see snippets of Daryl and Alexa's original audition tapes from 1999 ... and you can see for yourself that it's hard for Daryl and Alexa to be spy ""kids"" much longer.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
120,AddieS,"I know this is a kid's movie, but...",5,1 August 2003,"For the past 10 years I have seen just about every kid's movie that has come out and this one was probably the most disappointing.  I enjoyed the first two ""Spy Kids"" movies, but this one lost much of it's charm by reducing the screen time for Alexa Vega(Carmen), Antonio Banderas(Dad) and Carla Gugino(Mom).  The best part of the first two movies was the interaction between these characters and Daryl Sabara(Juni).The 3D was also disappointing.  The film was too dark with the glasses on and the cardboard was uncomfortable on my nose.  My son even commented after it was over that the 3D movies we had seen in Disney World and other places were much better.The good points in this movie were Ricardo Montalban(Grandfather), Courtney Jines(Demetra) and the surprise appearance of Elijah Wood(The Guy).  In fact, the only time I laughed out loud was when The Guy showed up like the knight in shining armor and then quickly met his demise.
To sum it up, it was still enjoyable for children if not for their parents, and parents should be pleased with the values it tries to show at the end of the film.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

During the game i liked the certain little touches, like how the Beta testers are in the game playing along side the lead. I also like the cameo's in the movie, especially Antonio Banderas and Elijah Wood's brief roles.Maybe cos i play games a lot i found this movie to be entertaining, but i still think it's worth a look from anyone who enjoys a bit of comedy, and for anyone who plays games for that matter.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

The only thing that made them spies is that they had a bunch of gadgets. The whole ""guy"" thing was taken right out of The Matrix. I've seen some other Rodriguiz movies and I liked them.

130,Storm59,'Game Over' never even started,1,5 August 2003,"What was RR thinking? What happened? The first two Spy Kids movies were pretty good kid flicks, but this is something put together from scraps of film found on the floor somewhere.The idea wasn't half bad. Carmen is trapped in a VR game and Junie and family have to go in and save her. But that's where it ends. Robert Rodriguez never used the plot other than to say 'hey, what if we can throw in some bad 3-D and sell lots of tickets?'Playing the game, a VR game called 'Game Over', playing it through to the end, could have been a pretty good movie, with the bad guy and the lost Carmen at the final confrontation. But instead, Junie and his band of VR enthusiasts, with Grampa at his side, simply go from one level to another pointlessly, without even the pretense of difficulty.Good points: Montalban's character is in a wheelchair, but when he joins Junie in VR he can walk. A few nice touches with that. And Sylvester Stallone as the Toymaker and the various incarnations of the Toymaker's fractured personality was humorous.I think it was quite misleading to put Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as stars of the film when their roles were actually so small as to be an afterthought.Maybe Rodriguez wanted to make the third film before the kids grew up too much, but another month or two writing a real script wouldn't have made much of a difference.Bottom line:Don't waste your time.

Why do parents cart their children off to the theatre to see a ""family"" film that even the little ones don't like. Guilt that is why. And guilty is what every one involved in this movie is. Guilty of greed,guilty of sequel laziness, guilty of insulting the minds of the average movie goer or even a pre schooler. Take the worst character in the series and make him the star to showcase either the favor the producer owed someone to to insure the kid never works in the town again. Mention the other characters and let them in for a total of 10 minutes (total) so they too get their hands dirty, and insure that there will never be another Spy Kids film and you have the best part of the film.

The cast does little to make this movie more watchable. While you may actually have moments of enjoying this movie, you would be better off putting it on for the kids & trying to get some housework done. The main problem is that as with any movie that cannot end well, deus ex machina solves the problem. The cast would have put to better use by creating something closer to the 1st or 2nd installments storyline.With that being said, there was some decent effects in this movie. The costumes were ridiculous & the lines deplorable, but the kids were great with what they had.

This film made me ashamed that when i was younger i enjoyed spy kids 1, 2, shark boy and lava girl and in the past few months spy kids 4. but the third spy kids film made me question my younger self being so bad i stopped watching 30 minutes or so in through heart ache and an urge to rant about it to sound like a critic :)To start off its the characters. I loved the charisma and family Morales the films based itself on, keeping to family and how Juni the immature weakling is taught to be strong by his older sister Karmen is just awesome, the bad guy constantly throwing hilarious tricks at them was funny but in this film everything was turned around. Karmen is trapped and needs Juni, (spoiler heavy if anyone still wants to watch by the end of the review) so he enters the game, being his usual self he is near being handicapped and gets his arse handed to him at level 1 by these high level players who are later shown to be beta testers. These characters are boring and without his sister Juni loses his charm and i hate him. Next the female is introduced, i admit now i'm older i probably won't see her as attractive and i don't mind BUT AT LEAST MAKE HER CUTE Jesus SHE WAS LIKE I Don't EVEN KNOW!!! next is another family member, a grandpa who for what i know is never seen before is stuck in a wheelchair. I think great, this guy could be like Xavier from X-Men and be an awesome psychic genius, nope thirty seconds later he is in a mech suit with legs... finally the protagonist, He is basically a programmer locked somewhere in the game and does nothing except talk to himself (to where I've seen)Next the story. Juni must get to level 4, find his sister then win the un winnable level to escape, wanna know how he can do this? BECAUSE HIS THE CHOSEN ONE! what the actual.. i mean if he had a plan or something that would be great but he is a noob to this game and just ""learns fast"" that's my next point. There are 2 engagements to where i saw. To start there is a mech battle round 1 Juni just gets stomped and dominated then round 2 ""suddenly i know how to do every trick, make new tricks and win"" and then round 3 ""This round is going to last just long enough for me to do 1 move then finish because the first 2 minute round 2nd 1 minute round and a 30 second round make sense. the next battle is a race which fits more into my next point.Animation, spy kids and SB+LG are known for their animation and 3d effects being great. I was watching in 2D but i could see that this was going to carry the movie, every time they could they would shove a boxing glove gag, debris, tunnels and more into your face to say ""HEY LOOK GUYS! 3D EFFECTS! ITZ Like 2007 AGAIN WHERE IT WAS NEW AND WE WANT TO SHOW OFF!"" this annoyed me because they could of spent this on writing, better characters for new people, better costumes or maybe even.. better 2D animation. The film being set in a video game means everything was animated, most costumes, sets, props and everything was animated and they all looked horrible, out of scale, low res and looked like something made from play dough but not in a good way where you can think ""haha this has charm to it"" but instead ""okay, thats just stupid and unreasonable, why would somebody want this""My last point is humour, there are a few jokes here and there, nothing i could say ""i see what they did there"" to but they were there e.g ""programmers"" acting cool (acting could be a whole other topic but it think i will just put it down to poor writing) then being computer ""nerds"" IRL or i need to talk to me atarisegatendo wizard (a terrible joke indeed for the older audience but still poor)TL;DR it was poorly written, poorly animated, trying to invoke nostalgia from the audience or make the younger audience look in awe at the 3D effects, I'm not sure if i was suffering from the ""vanilla wow effect"" by thinking the older stuff was better or if it was genuinely bad but I'd rate it a 2-3/10 points awarded for the very lack luster humour and the effort that the actors put in to make the poor script work.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over

The last 15-20 minutes of the movie made me laugh so hard i cried. so much absurdity in such a seemingly serious setting in such a short period of time that i guarantee you will laugh uncontrollably even thinking about it.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
152,l-00642,Terrible,1,28 September 2017,"I'm Bruce Bannermam I'm here to tell you my opinion on the film spy kids 3 Game Over. This movie is known for a having a great cast which have had the unfortunate bad luck of staring in this film. I tell you this film would of been a lot better if only the directors were real men and not hipster men, I tell you Melbourne has a real representation in this film.It was clear the directors were cracking a fat over the actors. though the cast did not clearly have a lack of talent. This movie would clearly see a much needed increase of appeal in the 90's any reviewer that has gone and given this movie a good review has been payed off and is telling porkies.Anyway I particularly liked the scene were the kid made the other kids brain fart as that is quality television. It could be seen in one scene that the actors were jerking the mutton knocking about for a paycheck. The animation quality is awful for the budget of the film. In all honesty this film makes me wish I had died off during the Emu War.",Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over
