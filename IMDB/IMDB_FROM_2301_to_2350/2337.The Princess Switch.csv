0,phd_travel,Vanessa Hudgens makes this just worthwhile,6,25 February 2019,It's just so fun watching multi talented Vanessa Hudgens act in the dual roles of baker and royal fiancée. There are some not so great moments and parts that could be better but who cares. Her exaggerated English accent is part of the charm. The trading places formula usually works. And her charm helps gloss over the more painful moments.Sam Palladio of Nashville shows his native English accent for a change.Some parts are lame but it's still ok.,The Princess Switch
1,Robert_duder,Insatiably adorable,8,25 November 2018,"My guilty pleasure legacy will be these horribly squeamish adorable Christmas flicks. Not all of them are great but some are just too adorable to dislike. The Princess Switch rips pieces from other family films like The Parent Trap, Monte Carlo, Big even, Freaky Friday and so on. You have to know exactly what is going to happen at every single step and you love the adventure and fun all the way through. This film is simple, cute, fun, and the dual roles played by the same actress are actually very good and shockingly distinguishable. The sheer idea of two identical people hardly even related is ridiculous and yet the two characters are different enough that it is believable. The inevitable build up to the reveal keeps you on your toes and there is some genuine sweet moments to keep things going.
Vanessa Hudgens does a solid job of her dual roles. You really do stop seeing her as one person and that speaks a lot to the performance. It's not some sort of Oscar winning role, it's just cute and fun and she does a great job. Sam Palladio is the Prince one of them is supposed to marry. He's not likeable in the beginning but he really does grow on you through the eyes of Hudgen's character. He has decent chemistry with her too. Nick Sagar is also good as Hudgen's best friend who becomes the object of one of Hudgen's character's affections. They have the best chemistry of the four characters and three actors. Alexa Adeosun is adorable as Sagar's daughter and Hudgen's goddaughter. She's underused but she definitely serves a purpose. Suanne Braun, Mark Fleischmann, Sara Stewart and Pavel Douglas are all good in their supporting roles. Stewart and Douglas are particularly good in very small roles as the King and Queen. They look their roles.
Mike Rohl has a huge history behind the camera in Television and he clearly knows how to make the most of the recipe the film follows. He holds things together, uses the Christmas scenery well and doesn't over extend what the audience wants to see. The film is very light hearted and then goes through a period of drama to get to the end results and it's the perfect tame roller coaster for a cheesy, cute Christmas film. If that is what you want out of a movie you won't go wrong with this one. 8.5/10",The Princess Switch
2,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,5,2 December 2018,"The princess Switch is a decent movie for the hollidays. But do not expect too much out of it. It was just okay. Even the romance was weak, as the story couldn't help the love stories. But, overall, it was okay for a holliday movie.",The Princess Switch
3,pmtelefon,Harmless,5,1 December 2018,"Harmless is a fair way to describe ""The Princess Switch"". It tells it's ""Parent Trap"" type story at a pretty good pace. Very little down time. Vanessa Hudgens is an appealing actress. The rest of the cast is fine as well but this is Hudgens' movie. She carries it well. My two daughters (20 and 16) liked it. My wife (age classified) also enjoyed it. It was okay. I'm sure I'll get stuck watching a couple of more times. That's fine.",The Princess Switch
4,RosanaBotafogo,Cute e clichê...,7,9 January 2021,"Very cute, very cliché, as Christmas tales usually are, but with some very funny scenes, like the funny scene of the horse, slapstick and cliché, as all Christmas movies are, but adorable...",The Princess Switch
5,lisafordeay,Enjoyable Christmas romance starring Vanessa Hudgens,7,26 November 2018,"The princess switch is a 2018 romantic comedy starring Vanessa Hudgens acting in a dual role about a young baker named Stacy who's best friends with a widowed father named Kevin (who likes Stacy more than a friend).During a convention for a bakery competition,Stacy bumps into Lady Margaret(Hudgens with a British accent)who is shocked by how herself and Stacy are alike. So Margaret decides to swap places with Stacy for 2 days as she wants to live an ordinary life. However problems arise when Stacy falls in love with Prince Edward while Margaret falls in love with Kevin. So will they or won't they get their dream men in the end. And who is the mysterious elderly man who pops up now and again.Overall it's a very predictable movie that has been done before with Selena Gomez called Monte Carlo and Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap..
If you love princesses and fairy tales do check it out.
I enjoyed it and will definetly research it again on Netflix.",The Princess Switch
6,vivianla,Romantic And Cheerful Vibes,9,1 November 2020,"The opening song is so cheery. I love it.Stacy De Novo is a baker in Chicago. She has her own shop and speaks so kindly to a customer. She works with her friend Kevin who has a daughter. The shop and all the holiday cheer is so pretty.Kevin has submitted Stacy for a baking competition in another country. Stacy runs into her ex, Paul, and his new gf. She decides on the spot after hearing their big plans she will do the competition.They enjoy the country and go to set up at the place. Stacy's former classmate from post-secondary is there and Stacy says she knew a lot of the faculty. The reason is something about their balls lol. This classmate spills something red on Stacy's apron and Stacy goes off-stage to clean up. She runs into the future Princess of Montenegro. They gawk at each other, astonish at how similar they look. The princess brings her back to her room and introduces Stacy to her trusty assistant, Ms. Donnatelli.The princess asks if they could switch places for two days. They switch belongings and teach each other behaviours to act out.The princess attempts to make breakfast at their cute little place they are staying but burns the food. The daughter realizes it is not Stacy and suggests they go out to eat where through a phone call they all confirm together the true identities. The princess talks on the phone with Stacy one evening when Kevin comes in asking for toothpaste, shirtless. The princess finds it hot and asks Stacy if she ever saw Kevin shirtless.Edward, the prince, has decided to stay back and spend time with his future wife instead of going travelling for the country's affairs. He is so cute - he sees Stacy in her pink nightwear and looks away, asking if it is the right time. They go horseback riding and Stacy's outfit is cute - white jeans, boots, super cute. Stacy and Edward slowly fall in love with each other and at the charity ball, Stacy comes out with Donnatelli in a red strapless dress. They hear giggling and realize they are standing under the mistletoe so Stacy moves in to kiss him but he turns so she kisses his cheek. Stacy wears a little red scarf, French hat to go visit the parentless children.Stacy reads to the children who are so lovely. One kid asks if she is in love with the prince. They are standing under the mistletoe as pointed out by a child and kiss on the lips. Stacy notices their tree has no presents so she suggests they go get some.The four of them go to the toy emporium and fill up their cart with tons of toys. It is cute to see Stacy and Edward having fun together and playing Twister.Edward announces after they give the gifts that the princess and him will visit every month to get to know all of them. Christmas is not just about the gesture.Edward gives Stacy his grandmother's necklace that has been in his family for three hundred years. Stacy tearfully kisses him on the lips and says his duchess will see him tomorrow.After tucking the daughter in her beautiful bedroom with a cute cabinet thing, the royal highness and Kevin watch Stacy's favourite movie and they cry. Kevin tells her he gave her a present and it is in her stocking. She gets up to go get it and it is a locket. Kevin confesses his new feelings for her and they kiss on the lips. The princess pulls away asking if they can forget anything happened and leaves. She kisses him on the cheek before she leaves.The two women meet back at the princess's room. They admit their feelings for the other's man. The annoying man takes photos of the two of them together. He gives them to the queen who insisted he give them to her first instead of the king.At the dining table, the queen asks Edward and the princess to go in her place to the baking competition. She gives a look to her husband. The princess is startled and excuses herself.Edward finds her on a bench and she tells him she has a lot to tell him - the switch.Edward and the princess go to the competition but she wears sunglasses. Despite their mixer's cord being cut off because the rival did so, Stacy and Kevin wins with their festive holiday cake. The beautiful blonde judge in the red dress tries their cake. She is so pretty - her facial expressions and her gracefulness...even the way she sits. The rivals did a snowball cake. The princess puts the medal on each winner and last is Stacy and Kevin. She takes off her sunglasses. They all go off stage.There, explanations are told. Back out on the stage, Edward gets down on one knee and proposes to Stacy in front of everyone including her rival. He asks Stacy to marry him one year from now.We see Edward and Stacy's wedding. The princess catches the bouquet and looks at Kevin smiling.Ending music is beautiful and cheery.",The Princess Switch
7,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Princess Switch,7,23 December 2020,7/10 - Vanessa Hudgens-led holiday flick is a lot of festive fun,The Princess Switch
8,r96sk,I dig it,7,23 December 2020,"I like it.'The Princess Switch' is basically 'The Parent Trap', but I felt it added a decent edge to it to make it suitably entertaining. I enjoyed seeing it all unfold, it's well made. I found the casting and pacing good.I rate Vanessa Hudgens and thought she did a great job here, given she's playing a dual role; and practically has to act four different ways as Stacy and Margaret. She's convincing. There's not much happening away from her, I admit.Cheesy Xmas vibes, of course. I dig it though.",The Princess Switch
9,AnnaPagrati,Beautiful!,9,28 August 2021,"This movie is really heart-warming, perfect for the holidays!",The Princess Switch
10,Kamurai25,"""Freaky Friday: Princess Diaries""",6,28 November 2020,"Decent to good watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend.There is a whole range of movies that ""have to be"" bar bets. Someone bet Vanessa Hudgens she couldn't do a Lindsey Lohan ""Freaky Friday"" or an Anne Hatheway ""Princess Diaries"" and someone she knew had a Christmas season slot coming up so they made this.While everyone else in the cast is fine, the only other actor really worth mentioning is Mia Lloyd, but I'm sure it is easy for a competent, spunky kid to play a competent, spunky kid.The storyline is simple enough, if not powered by plot serendipity. It's fairly amusing, including the bad British accents, but it lacks impact.",The Princess Switch
11,nancyldraper,Just exactly what it promised,7,24 December 2018,"Mark Twain did it, Shakespeare did it over and over again, now Netflix takes it over. An impossible premise. An improbable ending. But that is all known to audience before it begins, so, based on those expectations an audience gets exactly what was promised. Vanessa Hudgens is adorable. I always look forward to Sam Palladio. A good supporting cast. A lazy 1 hour and 41 minute watch on a snowy afternoon. I give it a 7 (sappy but lovable) out of 10. {Fantasy Romance}",The Princess Switch
12,brookenichole-98054,Just Bad,2,19 November 2020,"The Princess Switch is nothing special. It's very cliché and was definitely aimed at young kids. It didn't keep my attention and was very drab. My main reason for watching this was Vanessa Hudgens. Yes, the whole plot is completely ridiculous, but entertaining enough. The Christmas decorations are the best part.
It's weird, it seems that Kevin actually really liked Stacy the whole time. I didn't feel any romantic chemistry between Vanessa or the two men. If anything, it was better with Nick Sagar and Vanessa; Sam Palladio seemed very stiff. By the way, this movie will make you cringe.
Honestly, the whole movie I wanted Kevin and Stacy together and the two royals could just leave.
If you want to see Christmas decorations and two Vanessa Hudgens, then this should be enjoyable at least.",The Princess Switch
13,legobuilderpro,Hallmark,5,25 November 2020,"This felt like a hallmark movie, with a cute story that could have worked with something else.The ending was kind of sudden",The Princess Switch
14,apryla-58795,This could have been worse...but I doubt it,1,17 November 2018,"This is what happens after High School Musical 3 apparently. Vanessa Hudgens is very cute and not the worst actress BUT I think it's funny that she thought she was gonna be the next big thing after Disney. She tried to do serious movies but in the end she got a wake up call, realized nobody was checking for her and now she is accepting offers like this.You can tell that everyone has completely run out of fresh ideas for movies so they went back to the well for the hundredth time and brought out this old chestnut. You've seen the doppelganger thing before - The Parent Trap, The Prestige, The Man in the Iron Mask, Moon over Paramoor, Bowfinger, etc...but any of those are Oscar winners compared to this.Also when will they be tired of using the old ""America humanizes Royalty"" message? Americans are portrayed as a bunch of uncivilized individuals but who also have BIG hearts who show the royals how to loosen up and have compassion. Cringeworthy and insulting to both groups.Let's start from the beginning shall we? Vanessa Hudgens (going forward will be referred to as ""VH"") owns a bakery (because of course) and it seems to be right on a Main Street in a big city. She is the ""best kept secret"" according to a regular customer. Also VH talks about how they haven't quite made it yet and don't have the money blah blah BUT if that's the case how can she afford the rent in that primo spot?Next VH's bakery shop co-owner tells her about this baking competition a few days before it is to take place and he tells her it's an all expenses paid trip. Ok sure it is. There were over a hundred competitors and this organization is just gonna fund everyone's plane tickets and lodging for a few days AND give the winner a huge check if they won?! Give me a break! Also they just up and take off for this trip after VH says they can't afford to leave the shop and you never find out how they made arrangements for the shop to be tended to while they were gone. Guess the same magical old guy who was popping up everywhere else was gonna watch the shop while they were gone.Next she runs into (literally) a duchess who is by herself (when is a Royal ever by themselves?) and she suggests they swap places so she can have some freedom...um I'll tell you how you can have freedom...don't marry this guy and go do your thing. It's not the 1800's! But no duty calls so they go through the fastest crash course of learning about each other's body language and personality I've ever seen in a movie-and presto! Just like that they can mimic each other perfectly. One small detail you will miss if you aren't paying attention but I think is so laughable is-Duchess VH has a pointer she whips out during this crash course to show this elaborate chart to common VH. Ok WHO has a pointer just handy like that?! ""Hmm...what else can I put in my purse? Oh I know-a pointer in case I run into someone who looks like me and I have to switch roles with them when I'm feeling couped up and need to get away for a few days."" Puh-lease! So stupid! And even if a royal had to get away why would they choose to go live with total strangers?! They'd either want to be alone or wander about by themselves so that's just lame.Even twins have subtle differences which allow people to tell them apart and yet everything about these two is identical and no one knows?! So unrealistic!What about that scene at the ball where VH is outside in the gazebo? Ok first of all a duchess wouldn't just be able to walk outside on their own unnoticed, unaccompanied and unaccounted for. Someone would no doubt go with her if only for protection as most royals have that...and yet there she is all alone just waiting for Edward. It's freezing outside and she's in a strapless gown and not shivering. That was so unrealistic! I kept waiting for him to offer her his jacket but nope apparently he felt that she was immune to the cold even after she kept going on and on previously about how warm it was where she was from. Oh men! They never listen.How about the baking competition? Ok every cooking show I've ever seen shows the competitors putting their cake ingredients into a mixer and yet these two had their cakes made and baked and ready for filling before she even had to use the mixer. They could have brought the compromised mixer to someone's attention and they would have gotten a replacement but nope! They just figured it out and still won-surprise surprise!VH managed to do an ok accent at some points throughout the film but in others you could tell she was struggling. She had some kind of vocal fry thing going on that kept distracting me. She sounded like a croaking frog at the end of all her sentences. I thought Hollywood had vocal coaches but the budget was pry too low for one in this epic fail. Either that or VH felt pretty overconfident she could pull it off. We see how that turned out.The prince character looked like he was gonna slap VH at different points throughout the film. You could tell this actor was wondering what on earth possessed him to take this role. His agent pry sold him a bill of goods about how great it was gonna be and then he shows up and sees he's gonna be acting with an ex-Disney actress who is butchering the accent he comes by honestly. Not gonna lie I actually felt bad for him.I could go on and on but what's the point?The only thing good about this film was...some of the decorations. Other than that ""switch"" to any other choice in your Netflix queue but this.",The Princess Switch
15,khunkrumark,Netflix does Lifetime!,3,18 November 2018,"Dreadfully cheesy cheesiness!The acting is just awful and the English accent should be made illegal. No budget for a voice coach! The rest of the movie stinks, too. The script is dire. The loathesome, toothy characters all need a good slap to wipe away the relentless grinning. The story is as old as time itself and of all the 100,000 versions already made, this is easily the very worst.If there is someone in your life this Christmas that you really hate, recommend this to them. They'll never bother you again!",The Princess Switch
16,dianamarinelli,I like this movie,9,23 December 2020,Good movie the premise is like the Barbie princess and the pauper when two strangers switch for a day and fall in love with the males but good movie overall,The Princess Switch
17,aminifatimaaa,"generic, clichéd cinema, nothing new here",4,31 December 2018,"While entertaining in concept alone, The Princess Switch gives the viewer far too much stupidity and not nearly enough satisfaction. The story is far too rushed and leaves us no time to enjoy either of the romances, and finishes with a lacklustre finale.",The Princess Switch
18,MIssM19,Very Hallmark of them.,7,23 November 2018,"I didn't hate this. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot. The only thing that bothered me was the overused plot of royalty and Vanessa's accent.The secondary characters were amazing and Vanessa did an incredible job. I found myself smiling like an idiot during several scenes. Predictable, but adorable, and perfect to pass the time or watch during this time of the year.",The Princess Switch
19,jp281995,Cute and Light,6,27 November 2018,"The Princess Switch is a Christmas-sy cute, entertaining and light but with a very predictable plot kind of movie. The story reminds me of that game I used to play called ""Choices"".Vanessa Hudgens is adorable and cute as both the characters, but her English accent even as the Duchess is really cringey and not good. The story of course is predictable, nothing new or clever and it has some plot holes and obvious mistakes but at least it is entertaining, especially for the holiday season.",The Princess Switch
20,Golden_Hope,Messy and Mediocre,3,18 November 2020,"I'll say straight off I actually dozed off at the hour mark and had to finish it when I woke back up so that probably tells you about the movie.It is just the same story that has been told over and over again apart from it is full of uncomfortable moments caused by the swapping. It just fell flat for me.This movie is also a huge mess. The use of stock footage is a disaster. The plane the set of on from Chicago is a every day plane but then when it arrived it was like a wooden plane?? It was just like ""oh well it was cheap footage never mind"". It wasn't even just that there was so much that I was like what?.The whole movie just felt cheap. The parts where both Vanessa's were in the same shot were a disaster. The stand in was out of sync and looked different. I don't understand why you wouldn't put more effort in.The acting and writing were also pretty poor but I get it, this type of movie isn't going for that. And like I get that they are cheap and stuff but this was just such a mess and felt really like the director was not invested in it at all",The Princess Switch
21,hjalsayegh,Generic princess and the pauper movie,4,16 November 2018,"A movie that belongs on the hallmark channel. As generic as can be without anything that'll offend.The princess here is actually a Duchess and the pauper is a baker and they run into each other on Christmas while the later is preparing for a baking competition.I feel like I read a studio exec. checklist just now... Well the rest of the movie actually goes like a checklist too. Girls meet, switch places, go through the motions of the Prince and the Pauper but with a princess diary peppered in as well as a Christmas miracle for good measures and true love because why not. Everyone is happy all the time and you can just play this in the background and miss nothing.
It's a piece of fluff so if that's your thing go ahead, just keep in mind that the first 15 minutes is a painfully awkward exposition that was both badly written and poorly acted. Get past that and you get to... every hallmark movie ever.",The Princess Switch

24,mbhgkmsgg,Cheesy and stupid Christmas fun,6,22 November 2020,"I have no idea why, but I really enjoyed this more than I'd like to admit. The Princess Switch is, to no ones surprise, extremely cheesy and bad. But it's cheesy and bad in just the right way.These are the types of movies that I'm usually really indifferent about. There's nothing wrong with them, nor is there anything to write home about. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, I found this one to be really charming. It made me laugh at things that I would usually roll my eyes at and more than kept me entertained for its entire runtime.Sure, it's extremely predictable and offers nothing new to the genre, but so what. If a movie entertains you and makes you have fun for a couple of hours, then it's doing what it set out to do. And sure, Hudgens' Downtown Abbey accent is awful and sure, it's unapologetically stupid, but so what. If a movie manages to make you smile, then it has to be doing something right. And the The Princess Switch certainly made me smile.There's really very little to say about a movie like this. I feel like a lot of people are really going to hate it and others are going to enjoy it. It's bad, but it's bad in just the right way. It's a Christmas rom-com, and it was both Christmasy and funny, what more can I really ask for.",The Princess Switch
25,alexpeychev,An enjoyable cheesy Christmas movie,3,13 January 2021,"Don't think too hard, this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously.

27,Benslie,Perfect for people who do and don't like RomComs,7,17 December 2018,"First of all, the set design in this film is spectacular. Every set makes you feel like you really are there with these characters. I also really liked the costume designs on them. It was an excellent choice for everybody and to show how the royalty has better-looking clothes compared to everybody else in the film. The acting in this film was marvellous. Nobody seemed like a character but a real human being. You can easily relate to either Stacy or Margaret in a way. For example, you either connect to Stacy because you are the type of person who plans out everything or Margaret who is spontaneous. I had no issues with the pacing at all in this film. Everything seemed to flow from one thing smoothly to the next. I think one of the only things that bugged me about this film was how everything happened like magic and was never explained.There was a character in this film that just kept appearing at the right moment and it was never explained. And two characters would stand underneath mistletoe that magically appeared out of nowhere. Also, it doesn't seem realistic. Yes, I know this is a fictional film but they make the characters out to be stupid and not question why Stacy or Margaret is acting differently than usual. They show signs of questioning it but again like when things happen in this film they just shrug it off. Other movies who have done this kind of plot had a few characters shrug it off but not all. Also, I'm pretty sure who wrote this movie wrote A Christmas Prince there is a lot of similarities between the two princes. In the end, this movie is good for people who like RomComs or who don't.",The Princess Switch

Having said that, this was very well done, the pace of the movie was good, and when ended it leaves you wishing there was more (hence the sequal). It's lol funny in some places and Vanessa Hudgens did a fantastic job with the two characters, coming close, at times to making you forget it's the same actress in both roles. So yes, it's been done before, but this one was done well, and certainly well worth a watch....or two",The Princess Switch

38,sara2520,Another Cheesy Netflix Movie,6,20 November 2018,"Netflix Christmas movies may be cheesy, predictable, and repetitive but they are enjoyable. Vanessa Hudgens plays double, Stacy the baker and Margaret the Duchess, in the Princess Switch. After winning a chance to compete in a baking competition in a fictional country, she travels to the country with her sous chef and long time best friend Kevin and his little girl Olivia played by Alexa Adeosun, a great actress who steals every scene she's in with her adorableness, quick wit, and smarts. After a baking rival ruins her apron, she runs into Margaret, her lookalike and who is engaged to a handsome crowned Prince Edward she only met twice in her life. Margaret convinces Stacy to switch places with her for a couple of days so Margaret can get a chance to be normal. There's a cute montage where they teach one another how to act and behave like the other. Hudgens does a great job of making you believe she's two different people like Lindsay Lohan did with the Parent Trap remake which this movie sneakily added a small tribute t if you catch it. It's a cute romantic Christmas movie where both ladies find love. I also love that Nick Sager, an Indian British man, was cast as one of the romantic leads Kevin and gets the girl instead of being the token friend of color or Duckie who watches his dream girl go off with the rich, handsome white guy. Even though the movie was mediocre, predictable, plugged a Christmas Prince like it's twin Christmas movie The Holiday Calendar did, and took a few elements from a Christmas Prince too especially with the second to final scene with Stacy and Edward, like the Holiday Calendar, it's an enjoyable movie to watch. I did appreciate in the ending Netflix did to save us from a sequel like the Christmas Prince Sequel still coming out. But I did enjoy this movie and Holiday Calendar and will add them to my annual Christmas movie list.",The Princess Switch

I watched it by myself with a cup of cocoa while my husband and our two little girls slept (I am 36 by the way).

Yes, the idea of identical people meeting and switching places MAY seem a bit played out but this movie has its own charm to it.

50,mmccrady,Exceeded Expectations,10,28 November 2018,A must-see Christmas movie! Everything about it was great.,The Princess Switch
51,AJ-Reviews,Solid movie with higher-than-typical budget for this genera,8,16 January 2020,"Vanessa Hudgens does a fantastic acting job as she pulls off two characters, (really four) because...
(each character on their own = 2) + (A version of each character pretending to be the other = 2).... 2+2=4. That is the one part of the review you can't argue with.
This movie is just like many others from the genera except it has a much larger budget and it shows. Overall this movie is solid in every way from acting to set design. There is incredible detail such as the tree-ornaments weaved into the design of a horse-drawn carriage. All the clothing looks amazing. Everything is perfect. If I had to knit-pick, then I would say I felt bad for the butler who technically wasn't a bad guy. He's just trying to do his job and got the brunt of the bad humor (and some cheesy falling off a balcony scene..they could have left that out on the cutting floor). Come to think of it, there is a character who is never really explained, you know the one, the guy who has magic powers or some special christmas magic whatever. The whole movie was weakened by using him as a plot device (aka bad writing) in order to push the story forward at certain points. Anyways, the conclusion: The movie is a solid Christmas Romance Movie with a couple touching parts but doesn't dive deep enough into true theme and meaning of the human condition...what the heck am I saying there. It is kinda shallow, one of those ""falling in love in two days"" I dunno. Maybe I'm a guy and I shouldn't be reviewing these kinds of movies.",The Princess Switch

It is a simple movie. Simple script. Simple acting, although the acting actually is more than good enough. Sam Palladio was basically born to play prince Charming, and Vanessa is decent and at times more than so. But it is the simpleness and the essence of this movie that will bring you a smile on your face and maybe even a tear.

72,ChristmasMovieReviews,The Great Ruritanian Bake Off?,6,29 December 2020,"In the 2018 final of The Great British Bake Off, insecure but brilliant nuclear scientist Rahul's stand mixer cracked and shattered, sending shards of glass across his work station and through all of his carefully prepared ingredients. He had to start everything again from scratch and incredibly still had the technical baking excellence and imagination to emerge victorious as that season's champion. Why is this at all relevant to The Princess Switch, a lightweight festive romance movie? Well, because that warm and cosy real-life baking show managed to conjure up a finale with far greater drama than the end of this scripted fantasy, which dropped on Netflix at around the same time.Like the Bake Off finale, The Princess Switch also concludes with a mixer emergency at a high profile baking competition (in this case heroine Stacy's mixer has had its power cord cut by her mean spirited rival). Unlike in the real world, however, this doesn't seem to be much of a stressful crisis. The movie sets this up like it's going to be a big thing, that winning the baking contest is a big deal for Stacy, that her rival is a major antagonist, and that this sabotage might ruin her chances. But then she just like: ""I guess we'll just have to make the decorations by hand"" and there's a cut to the finished cake and she's done just that with minimal fuss. There's no drama at all, no sense of peril or possibility that she might not finish or even not win. The rival doesn't even seem especially angry to come second. Hell, there's barely any actual on screen baking, just people in aprons and finished cakes.Yes, watching this movie about a baker travelling to another country for a prestigious baking competition only to feature barely any actual baking (at one point she suggests baking Christmas cookies to her love interest and, instead of a standard festive movie baking montage, she just shows up later with some cookies) did make me feel like Milhouse watching Itchy and Scratchy demanding ""when are they going to get to the fireworks factory?"" But, really, this is more just a small example of a wider issue with a movie that doesn't massively care about stakes or drama. I mean, the story has a foreigner essentially infiltrating the royal court and impersonating the country's future queen and nobody (including her soon-to-be husband) seem massively bothered by it!The baking contest is, of course, merely a pretext for the movie to get Chicago native Stacy over to Netflix's latest Ruritania in order for the real story to begin. Following A Christmas Prince's Aldovia, we now find ourselves in Belgravia, the most English-seeming central European country imaginable, where every place (including the nation itself) is named after parts of London.The model mostly cited for The Princess Switch's central plot (in which Stacy swaps places with her royal doppelganger Duchess Margaret) is Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper. In truth, though, this has more in common with the original ""Ruritanian romance"" The Prisoner of Zenda, only, you know, without any of the swashbuckling adventure or hissable villains or sense of peril.Like Zenda, The Princess Switch actually has an explanation for the identical royal and commoner, stemming from a scandalous liaison involving a shared ancestor several generations earlier. Like Zenda, it takes advantage of the fact that an engaged royal couple wouldn't actually have got to know each other before the official engagement, meaning that the fiancé doesn't notice the switch and the double can be the one to first charm them. Like Zenda, its romantic dilemma is ultimately one between love and royal duty. And, like Zenda, it is slyly, even quite probably unwittingly, republican, in showing that an ordinary person makes a better royal than someone born to do it. Why don't we just find a superior lookalike to sub in for all royalty?A movie that's a mash-up of a Great British Bake Off finale and The Prisoner of Zenda sounds utterly delicious and, even though The Princess Switch never really rises to that promise, it is a presentably sweet, light confection, albeit one that's mostly empty calories. Netflix's favourite festive additive, Vanessa Hudgens, does a fair job in the double role and her Disney past leaves no doubt that this is a movie very much for those teens and adults who never truly outgrew their princess fairytale phase. The Princess Switch doesn't leave you particularly hungry for seconds (although there is a sequel), but it's a satisfying enough dish on its own. It just had the ingredients to be something better.",The Princess Switch

It has barely there plot with so much unrealistic and noncaptivating twists, that it surely made cringe even Vanessa Hudgens.The whole concept of the movie feels like someone just wanted to shoot a new Christmas - themed ""romantic"" movie, but had so little time to think through it, that he decided to write the first thing that came into his mind. This movie has nothing to offer except fancy locations and horrible acting. The characters are boring as hell and the whole storyline just seems silly.I personally think that this movie was shot for people who are just bored during the Christmas break, and aren't very choosy when it comes to movies, so they just click on the Netflix and find first Christmas movie that catches their eye and watch it.

81,nbery,Why Netflix?! Why??,2,27 November 2018,"There are so many great shows on Netflix, I am BAFFLED as to why they green-lighted this turkey. All the good reviews here are most definitely PAID for.Let me start by saying I am a Vanessa Hudgens fan, having watched the High School Musical flicks with my kids and even enjoyed them somewhat.
I can enjoy simplistic rom-com movies for what they offer; empty good fun for a no-stress, relaxing evening. But they should have a basic plot and a script not written by 1st graders. And please, splurge for an appealing prince. With all the wanna-be actors roaming LA, how hard would it be to get a better looking guy to play across Vanessa who doesn't look like her financial advisor.This movie disappoints from start to finish. The story is completely implausible, offering no reason to suspend disbelief. A bakery owner closes up last-minute the week before Christmas? The princess switches places to ""get to know her people"" only to spend the WHOLE time with 2 people locked up in their house? There are so many more idiotic plot elements which make the whole movie just a random collection of scenes that never get you to care 1 bit about any of the characters. Don't even get me started on the weirdo elf-like dude who keeps appearing from Chicago to Belgravia with ""meaningful"" advice.Note to the costume designer: please do not dress a 20-something princess in Queen Elizabeth's wardrobe. What a waste of a beautiful Ms. Hudgens.My daughter and I spent the entire movie hoping it would get better. It didn't.

82,gracechrista,Hallmark Movie Corny Cringe,3,26 November 2018,"The dialogue and writing of this show is so predictable and vomit-inducingly cringeworthy. Everything that was said has been said before, every situation is stereotypical. I kept yelling out throughout it because I felt like I was going to combust from how corny it was. It wasn't badly-made persay, but everything looked very set-like and fake.... fake snow, fake town, fake country, fake ballroom, fake decor. The only saving grace is SOME of the cast actors.

But I will watch anything with Vanessa Hudgens, and in this movie she gets to wear a lot of very attractive outfits. She has beautiful brown eyes and that shiny black hair. Oh dear.But it's no different than any other cheesy x-mas romcom even with the switch twist. She's a baker who is competing in a contest in a fictional European country who meets a duchess (whatever that is) who looks exactly like her. The duchess wants to trade places to experience what it's like to be a regular gal. So they switch places.Just like any other cheesy x-mas romcom, love is in the air. There's Saint Nick, a bunch of cute little kids enamored with the concept of Christmas, and you can't leave out the wise old man who appears to various characters bequeathing his wisdom.

I'm sorry but that would still not make you look identical.There is plenty of eye rolling moments in this film, cause it is that ridiculous and so far from any true story. None of this would have ever have happened.Like I can't get over how bad this script was, also could they not find a hotter guy to play Stacey's cooking mate?

120,Ceteros,Not for me,4,8 December 2018,"I can understand if you like this sort of movie as the message is sweet, but that's all that's good about the movie in my opinion. The plot is really convenient, the acting is mediocre at best and the dialog is really poor. I admit that I did laugh a bit during the movie so I guess there are worse movies out there.By far the most painful thing about the movie is the dialog. Basically every conversation feels forced and has incredibly strange lines. The romance felt forced (as they had only two days to 'fall in love') and most of the conversations did not feel natural at all. It is honestly embarrassing how many times we laughed at how awkward the dialog felt. It did make me smile quite a lot during the movie, but it doesn't make it good.Then the plot. The main character (Hudgens) Stacy is randomly invited to a baking competition where she meets doppleganger Margeret (also Hudgens) and they randomly decide to switch places. Why? 'For fun', which is a really poor argument in my opinion. The doppleganger scenes were decent but the Stacy+Edward (Palladio) plotline did not come out great.Finally, the characters. Hudgens tries her best but her acting doesn't come off as too realistic. Also, her british accent was not amazing. Most of the side characters aren't great but they aren't too bad either, except for Olivia. I'm sorry to say it, but that child can't really act very well and it was really annoying to watch.TLDR: Don't watch this movie if you don't like romantic comedies.",The Princess Switch

125,ryshea,"Cute enough for what it is, but still a clumsy story",5,18 November 2018,"This movie knows very much what it is: a cliche, Hallmark-style Prince and the Pauper-inspired fairy tale, and it does a decent enough job at creating cute and heartwarming moments (or eye-rolling ones, your mileage may vary). Hudgens has good chemistry with both male leads, and the acting can be weak but it's mostly because the dialogue they have to work with is incredibly cheesy. All that's expected from a movie like this, though.What stops me from rating it higher are the truly clumsy story elements. Cheesy's fine for something like this, and my disbelief was firmly suspended from the second I hit play, but on a basic plot level, there are a lot of elements that don't really go anywhere or just didn't work. For example, the rival baker could be removed completely without affecting the plot one bit. There's a point toward the end where she sneaks in and sabotages the lead's baking equipment. There's an entire scene devoted to it, and you're led to believe it'll probably lead to, well, anything. But instead of slowing the characters down or creating a hero moment for anyone, the lead notices the cut wire mid-competition, her partner says ""it's ok, just do it by hand,"" and then she does, and they win. It added nothing.The other major problem is that Hudgens' characters are framed as being incredibly different people -- one of them is spontaneous, the other always sticks to the plan, one is forthright and outspoken, the other shies away from the spotlight -- but in practice they're completely... well, interchangeable. One of them goes off brief and gets in a spontaneous snowball fight that ends with her tangled up on the ground with her love interest. The other goes off brief and plays a spontaneous game of Twister that ends with her tangled up on the floor with her love interest. The duchess sneaks out of the castle to bond with the common people. The baker drags the prince off to bond with the common orphans. Everyone acts like ""the duchess"" is behaving strangely by being spontaneous and informal (""has she always been so different?""), but the duchess is *supposed* to be spontaneous and informal. It's the baker who's supposed to stick to the plan, but that's something she's never shown doing. There needed to be a much bigger difference in the characters' personalities, because there really wasn't anything to distinguish them beyond an accent.I also would've liked the wish-granter's story to resolve in any kind of way, even if the Vanessas just locked eyes with him at the end and had a realization moment. Maybe that's a less major issue, but it felt very unfinished to have him grant their wishes, keep appearing to help them out along the way, and for them to never have a spark of realization or gratitude for what happened.And probably the weirdest moment in this film was the very pointed in-movie ad for another Netflix Christmas movie.Overall if you're just looking to turn off your brain and have fluffy Christmas feels for a while... there are probably better movies to go to, honestly. But this wasn't terrible, and at times verged on cute. If you're a fan of other movies in this genre, you'll probably like this one too.",The Princess Switch

156,User4567,Judged by the cover,4,24 November 2018,"This movie is exactly what you think it will be. Actually, it's slightly less than what you might think. The plot could not be more straightforward, and yet it still manages to be riddled with holes. Finding ones soulmate with a few long stares, a couple moments of altruism, a 5 second snowball fight, and a whole pack of lies all over a 24 hour period is the least of this movies blatant disregard for novelty or logic. Also present is the archetypal bumbling henchman who would be better off working for TMZ, the vaguely helpful yet sassy maid, and, in the most surprising twist since the sixth sense, royal parents who reveal that they dont care at all about duty, even though the central conceit in any movie about royalty is the importance of duty. As a result the biggest conflict in this movie was when I was trying to tell the difference between royal Hudgens (RH) and American Hudgens ( AH). They not only look the exact same, they act the same. They wear the same lipstick, do their make up the same, hell they even have matching piercings. Besides a token attempt to associate AH with a sense of orderliness and RH with a sense of spontaneity, which fails to remain consistent throughout the movie, they are basically the same person, and as a result, their polarized opinions of the two love interests is blatantly unconvincing.All that being said, anyone who clicks play on this movie is not expecting Dr. Zhivago. If you're looking for sappy romance before you go to bed, this serves as well as anything else. I highly recommend it if you want to watch a movie where the happy ending is as predictable as the happy beginning and happy middle and is as easy to consume as the gallon of ice cream it needs to accompany it.",The Princess Switch

164,wallylewall,Oh Boy!,2,17 December 2018,"This movie brought me to tears...it was so awful. Asides from the clear references to Princess Diaries and the shameless Netflix product placement, there were some issues with the baking scene (and a lot of other scenes). These were just some things that jumped out at me, and I'm no baker.
1. They made a 7 layer cake, fully decorated with filling and coated in buttercream (?) in just 5 hours, with no stand mixer.
2. They didn't notice that the stand mixer's cord was cut until they had to make the filling, but somehow they already had cake and 3 layers were already decorated, around the same time as the other teams we could see.
3. She wanted to puree raspberries in a stand mixer, without the attachment (from what I could see), and when she couldn't use it she put the berries in a bowl instead?
4. It was a world class competition and there was apparently no security or cameras of any sort to stop people from sabotaging other teams.
5. Stacy went to a world class baking competition wearing high heels.
6. The prince didn't officially/publicly break off his engagement before proposing to Stacy.
7. Stacy wore unbelievably short skirts for a duchess who was about to marry into a royal family? (I have no problem with her outfits personally but I guarantee if it was a legit royal family they would have had something to say about that, especially going by Edward's reaction to seeing her in her nightgown.)
8. No accent coach, clearly? Script supervisor did a great job though, mostly.
9. Judge said the cake tasted great when the slice of cake she was holding very obviously had not been tasted yet, unless she just licked it.Honestly if you don't notice stuff like this in movies, you might enjoy it! It's a tad predictable but its a generic Christmas love story, and sometimes thats just what you need!",The Princess Switch
