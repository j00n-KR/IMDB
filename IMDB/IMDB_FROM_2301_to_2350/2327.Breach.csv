0,MartinHafer,It's depressing and violent and very unpleasant viewing...but is it THAT bad?!,5,1 August 2021,"""Breach"" is a film with a current rating of 3.1 on IMDB...low enough to merit its inclusion on its infamous Bottom 100 List. This would mean it's bad enough to be among the worst big budget films ever made...and as I watched the film it just didn't seem THAT bad...or even close. Sure, ""Breach"" is a bloody, violent and incredibly depressing film....and I am NOT singing its praises...but it is NOT 3.1 bad. It makes me wonder if there's something going on here...some attack on the film for some reason I do not understand. Again...I am not saying it's good....but it just didn't seem Bottom 100 worthy.This very depressing story is set over 120 years from now. The population of the Earth is 19,000,000,000 and some sort of plague is destroying mankind. So, in desperation, some huge ships are sent into space in order to send a small number of humans to what's been called 'New Earth'.The odd hero of this story is a stowaway. Most of the folk aboard the ship are in cryogenic suspension....with only a tiny complement to run the ship. During this time, some creature attacks and it's not only murderous but very smart. After invading a host's body, it begins working towards killing....and there's simply no reasoning with it....it only wants death. What's next? Well, I'm not going to spoil it in case you actually do want to see it.Could part of the reason the film did so badly is because during COVID folks did NOT want to see a film about the destruction of the human race? Perhaps. The timing certainly COULD have been better!! Maybe, maybe not...but it certainly is NOT a feel-good film!! But despite its gloom and violence and bloodshed, it's NOT a particularly badly made film. Depressing, you betcha. Bad, not especially and I have seen hundreds, if not thousands of worse films....worse films which, somehow, have much higher ratings and less hate than this film.",Breach
1,Leofwine_draca,Failure,3,20 April 2021,"BREACH is a low budget ALIENS rip-off set on a spaceship lit in shades of green and blue. It also goes under the title ANTI-LIFE. The story follows a bored crew as they go about their routine jobs until assailed by an alien life form which has the ability to travel from body to body. Routine action plays out until the climax. The whole thing seems to have been shot in a small enclosed set with a minimum of action and mostly centred around dull dialogue. Thomas Jane has a cameo and Bruce Willis has a surprisingly large role, but he plays this obnoxious wisecracking drunk who's really hard to engage with. Avoid.",Breach
2,SnoopyStyle,B-movie,4,22 December 2020,It's the year 2242 and Earth is in chaos. Those who could leave have left for a planet known as New Earth. Noah (Cody Kearsley) is a janitor on the last spaceship leaving Earth. The passengers are in cryo-sleep while he is part of a skeleton crew maintaining the ship.This is a sci-fi B-movie reminiscent of the many during late 80's and 90s trying to piggyback the Alien franchise and others like it. The story is simple and yet has too many sci-fi elements. The special effects are inferior as expected. There are good actors here but the lead is not one of them and I'm not sure if Bruce Willis is one anymore. The set designs are weak. Even the props are poor. I'm not as disappointed as most since I never had much expectations for this movie. This is a B-movie pure and simple but there are much worst out there.,Breach
3,Prismark10,Breach,1,19 February 2021,"Breach is a bad low budget film that rips off Alien, The Thing, Predator and 28 Days Later.Set in 2242.

It soon starts to infect the humans who go on a rampage to kill others.Noah (Cody Kearsley) is a stowaway whose pregnant girlfriend is in cryogenic sleep. She is also the Admiral's daughter.Noah teams up with veteran mechanic Clay (Bruce Willis) to fight off the creatures who seem to be indestructible.The pacing off the film is awful, the characterization is terrible, the special effects are poor. There is no originality and it might as well be a chepo SyFy movie.As the lead Kearsley is bland and wooden.

About halfway through their trip they blab something about ""Fermi's paradox"" therefore there are aliens.

5,classicsoncall,"""New Earth. We f..... up the old, so here's a new one.""",5,22 June 2021,"For Bruce Willis fans this is only slightly better than a handful of his more recent films like ""First Kill"", ""Acts of Violence"" and ""Trauma Center"". I don't know what possesses him to make flicks like this, maybe it's like your favorite band that just has to keep on playing because they love to create music. The concept here was derivative of other sci-fi offerings, most notably the Alien franchise. Did you ever wonder how a toxic substance like Moxacell can destroy anything it touches except the container it's in? That one kills me every time. And how about that composite monster that came together from all the blasted human and alien body parts? That was the dumbest looking creature I think I've seen since that Horta on the old Star Trek series from the Sixties; the episode was called 'The Devil in the Dark' in case you're interested. I rated that one higher than this thing. To paraphrase my summary line from the movie, I'll just say, '...they f..... up some other movies, so here's a new one.""",Breach
6,paul_haakonsen,Wow. Just wow...,3,19 December 2020,"And not wow in a good way!When I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Breach"" from writers Edward Drake and Corey Large I must admit that I was expecting a lot more from the movie that what director John Suits delivered. Why was that? Well, I mean a movie that had both Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane on the cast list? What could possibly go wrong here? What would there be not to like?Apparently if you take the movies ""Alien"" and ""28 Days Later"" and mix them together, you'd have the formula for ""Breach"" (aka ""Anti-Life""), except that ""Breach"" lacked the intensity and entertainment that both those movie have. ""Breach"" just feels like a watered down hybrid version of those two movies, where all energy has been sucked away.The storyline in ""Breach"" was as unoriginal as anything could be. Again, I redirect your attention to the ""Alien"" and ""28 Days Later"" movies and you have the storyline that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large managed to come up with. I am especially impressed that something like this would pass today and make it to the screen.Thomas Jane was not really all that much in the movie, which was good, as this movie will not tarnish his movie record all that much. Bruce Willis, however, was there almost all the time, and this movie was a swing and a miss from him, and it doesn't make a great addition to his repertoire of movies.I managed to sit through the movie to the very end, though I was hardly entertained by ""Breach"". In fact, I was more dumbfounded that a movie so blatantly ripping off two established movies could see the light of day. And the ending of the movie, now that was just a slap to the face. The storyline have you beaten down and stepped upon, but the ending just brings a cold, dead fish to the game and slaps your face repeatedly. That ending was just abysmal. Not only was it generic and predictable, but it was just saying that the audience watching it deserved no better.You might want to do yourself a favor and give ""Breach"" a wide berth. It is not worth the time, money or effort, believe you me. My rating of this 2020 movie lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",Breach
7,cruise01,Space thriller that could have been so much more.,5,4 February 2021,2.5 out of 5 stars.Breach is a science fiction action film about a space crew on an interstellar voyage to a new earth to start over. They come across some parasite creature that infects a person. And spreads towards others.The plot is decent. Concept of a space crew coming across something on the ship. That turns a person into a mindless mutant. And a monstrous creature in the end that is trying to consume life. There are other better films like this such as Pandorum. Alien.The direction in this film is terrible. Characters do make dumb decisions. The writing is cheesy and dumb. The acting is stale. It does have a great cast ensemble of actors that were in old action movies. Like Bruce Willis. Johnny Messner. And Thomas Jane whos performance who wears aviators shades inside a spaceship. Cody Kearsley performance is stale. Everyone is wasted in a bad script. The film also lacks thrills and suspense. The action is forgettable. The cliffhanger ending is entertaining.,Breach
8,wandernn1-81-683274,Worst Movie Willis Has Been In,2,25 May 2021,This movie was really terrible. I had to force myself to watch it to the very end. Even then I was staring at the screen in shock and disbelief at what I had just seen. Sad smoke filled nonsensical combat. Illogical alien behavior. Just bad bad bad writing. It's been a week since I watched it so I can't even recall all the reasons I hated it. What a terrible embarrassment for Willis. He should never have admitted to being in this movie. 2/10.,Breach
9,stevendbeard,Good Actors/Bad Script,4,25 December 2020,"I saw ""Breach"", starring Cody Kearsley-Riverdale_tv, Power Rangers_2017; Bruce Willis-Death Wish_2018, G.I.Joe:Retaliation; Rachel Nichols-Alex Cross, G.I.Joe:The Rise of Cobra and Thomas Jane-The Expanse_tv, The Punisher_2014.
This is a cheap 'B' grade movie with some normally good actors working with a bad script made of Swiss cheese. You can usually tell a lot about a movie by who gets top billing and who doesn't. It takes place in the not so distant future-about 2245 if I remember correctly-when the earth is dying because of plagues and other things we humans have done to it. They build an interstellar space ark to carry the surviving humans to a distant planet called New Earth, in hopes of starting over. Thomas plays the admiral of the ship but he spends most of his screen time in cryogenic sleep. Cody plays a janitor on board that is hoping to start a new life on New Earth with his girlfriend-she is on board too, but in cryogenic sleep. Bruce has worked for 10 years or more as a soldier but has been demoted for his insubordination and is now in charge of the janitors-Cody specifically-and usually drinks while Cody is working. Rachel is the nurse on board that has to deal with an alien life form that starts infecting people, turning them into space zombies that go around infecting more people. If you are thinking, 'Wow, Bruce Willis fighting Zombies in space!', forget it. There is very little of that kind of action. It's more like as if a person from another country looked at several American action movies and tried to make one of their own, using different pieces from each one. There is a commander who likes to smoke a cigar, an alien menace that can't be stopped by bullets-but is defenseless against something simple, a man that uses one liners while shooting the alien, etc.
It's rated ""R"" for language and bloody violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it is on cable.",Breach
10,kwenchow,"Another worst action film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Not recommended!",1,22 December 2020,"This film start with a people talking about human extinction, and a couple(Noah, and Hayley) been separated scene! As turnout, this film is about Noah need to survive and save Hayley from a bunch of people possess by alien parasite! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene!

12,lukem-52760,A CHEAP 'N' CHEESY B-MOVIE BUT I LIKED IT!!!,6,2 March 2021,"ANTI-LIFE is a very low-budget DTV B-movie in the Sci-fi Thriller Genre & starring ex-A lister BRUCE WILLIS & it's in my opinion fairly good fun!!!Now this is extremely low-quality & looks like a t.v series in it's overall look but i dig it's Cult Classic influences such as John Carpenter's The Thing, Prince of Darkness & Ghost's of Mars as well as Alien & other Sci-fi flicks & that gives it the old skool comforting charm as we feel like we've seen all this before because we have & it's definitely a comfort having Willis aboard this sci-fi Adventure as we all grew up watching the guy, he is an old skool Action legend.Set during Earth's last days as an inhabitable planet the last remaining humans in the hundred-thousands, are rushed aboard a huge space ship thats going deep into space to a new planet to start fresh & i think we as humans let are planet die because like in real life no one looks after our planet & only care about money so the story as a fantasy does have a ring of truth to it. The huge space ship puts everyone to sleep until they reach their new destination in about 6 months or so except a team of workers stay awake to make sure everything stays safe during the long journey & here we have our rugged team with the old A-hole veteran Bruce Willis as Clay & his new team mate played by Cody Kearsley (Riverdale) a maintenance/Cleaner & Johnny Messner (Sabotage) & a few other recognisable faces amongst the skeleton Crew & the leader/Captain of the ship the great B-movie legend THOMAS JANE (Deep Blue Sea, The Mist, The Predator, Nemesis, The Punisher) I'm a big Jane fan & even though he has basically a glorified Cameo it's better for the film that he's in it!!!
Bruce Willis starts out as a big A-hole with a drinking problem & a bad attitude but as the film goes along he's the Willis we know & love.
This Crew are up against an Alien creature that gets aboard the ship & starts to infect the workers & does all kinds of bloody & gross stuff & gradually are small crew have to gear up & fight this thing in an ""ALIEN"" kind of way & it's pretty fun B-movie stuff.The effects are very poor & thats due to the tiny budget but the actual creature looks good & the possessed workers are pretty Cool in a ""Prince of Darkness"" kind of way & the film has that fun late-night feel to it which i love.
Yes cheap & tacky effects & a Willis that really is only there for the paycheck but it's a fun little survival Apocalyptic sci-fi Thriller with a nice little bit for Thomas Jane. I liked it, good B-movie fun.",Breach
13,Pairic,A Zombies In Space film,5,19 April 2021,"Anti-Life (aka Breach): Not as bad as some say but still a bit of a mess. Bruce Willis is getting as bad as Nick Cage in accepting every role he's offered and here he plays a grizzled old veteran Space Navy Captain busted to the ranks for disobeying orders. He's on a Space Ark (doing menial work), fleeing earth as the environment finally collapses. 300,000 colonists (most in cryogenic sleep) are onboard, voyaging to New Earth which circles a distant star. But there's an alien parasite aboard! It kills crew members and then reanimates their bodies. They act and look like fast moving zombies so this is basically a zombies in space movie. The plot is a bit confused with a few hole and non-sequiturs. The acting and set design won't win any award either but it has a certain charm which kept me engaged, maybe it was the zombie element. Or the homages to Aliens, The Thing and other SF/Horror films. It had the ingredients to be a much better film but is just about watchable on a rainy evening. Directed by John Suits from a screenplay by Edward Drake and Corey Large. On Netflix. 5/10.",Breach

This is bad, just bad everything - I am lost for words!It is like some 70's low budget made for tv crapola and that is an insult to some of the great Roger Corman classics.Poor old Bruce looks like my grandpa now and even gramps has more life than poor old Bruce, he truly has lost his sparkle but like most actors they cannot give up the limelight and grow old gracefully and bow out with style.I know all the great acts from yesteryear like Lance Henriksen, Ron Perlman, John Cusack and Nicolas Cage are taking any old duffers now to pay the yacht mooring fees but I seriously dont think any of them would have taken the paycheque for this howler monkey.This is what I would describe as a career killer; a 6 foot deep one and all that is missing is the headstone ""Here Lies Bruce Willis Died Hard In 2020 R.I.P.""",Breach
16,IonicBreezeMachine,"A c-level sci-fi/horror cut and paste job, only distinguished by the fact that Bruce Willis is in more of it than you'd expect.",3,8 August 2021,"In the 23rd century, Humanity and Earth are on the cusp of an extinction level event and have begun evacuations for the colony of New Earth. Noah (Cody Kearsley) stows away on the U. S. S. Hercules impersonating a junior janitor while his pregnant girlfriend Hayley (Kassandra Clementi) is granted passage due to her father being the Admiral (Thomas Jane). While the passengers are put into hyper sleep Noah goes about custodial duties on the ship under the supervision of a demoted captain turned custodian, Clay (Bruce Willis), until eventually members of the support staff turn up dead or missing with signs pointing towards something inhuman as the culprit.To look at Bruce Willis' career is depressing because not too long ago the man appear in major blockbusters such as G. I. Joe Retaliation, RED 2 and A Good Day to Die Hard, while these movies weren't critically well received (for good reason) they were at least projects that made sense given Willis' status as an international action star. But outside of exceptions like Glass and a cameo in Motherless Brooklyn, Willis' primary output has been direct-to-video/streaming fodder for the company Emmett/Furla/Oasis with these film's featuring Willis prominently as the second billed actor despite only being in it for maybe 10 minutes with the rest done off camera or with a body double. With only two days of shooting and guaranteed $1 million pay day for each film it's no mystery why Willis has gone down this route. Breach (aka Anti-Life) isn't an EFO production, but it does reunite Willis with some crew who have worked on his EFO films, and while Willis is more prominent here than he was in many EFO film's the quality is definitely not improved simply because there's more of Willis.The movie is supposedly set in the 23rd century, but begins with a bunch of stock footage framed with a fish eye lens before transitioning to our ""future"" which looks like a rented storage area with a few dozen extras and a shambly chain link fence. And of course once we're actually on the ship things don't improve because it's clear it's just a refurbished warehouse with some red and green lights shined on walls with maybe the occasional flatscreen TV or poorly inserted hologram effect to assure the audience ""no seriously, this is the future!"". The movie features some brief CGI shots of the ship, but they're not particularly well rendered and it just calls attention to the fact that sets the crew are using are much smaller than it is. Not only is it unconvincing but despite being set in the 23rd century, the bathrooms on the ship look like public restrooms one would find at a bus stop and they're still using regular guns (which are cheap plastic replicas) except for one point where they break out cheap plastic lasers.The movie doesn't even have a good story behind its lackluster production values, because it's basically a cut and paste job of most of the Alien knockoffs of the 80s, but without any tradecraft or endearing qualities that made films like Galaxy of Terror or Creature enjoyable. Surprisingly though, the film despite being marketed as such isn't as directly ripping off Alien as one might think (at first anyway). The movie throws in zombie tropes, bits from The Thing, and even a little bit of Space Mutiny (though at least Space Mutiny stole special effects from John Dykstra). Most of the plot beats of this story you'll be able to predict as they're pretty much all here just because they were in other movies. Willis looks visibly uninterested despite being a prominent actor in the film with more screentime here than he had in most of his EFO projects, and Cody Kearsley of TV's Riverdale is not an engaging presence and feels hopelessly lost and confused with no real idea how to approach this character.On occasion I got a chuckle from some of the line deliveries (sometimes intentionally sometimes not) and there was a creature effect in the last ten minutes of the movie that looked okay(not great, but good enough) but then they overextended themselves with some rather inept expansions on it to try and milk all they could from it.Breach is a sad movie. It plays like one of those 90s direct to video films that tried to ape Alien's aesthetic on a miniscule budget, but at least those were made with no name actors on shoestring budgets and were kind of endearing in how stupid they were such as Leprechaun 4: In Space. Breach is just bare basics recycled to diminishing returns with the barest minimum of effort put in and sold to you using cast members like Bruce Willis to bank on their name recognition.",Breach

Not intentionally funny or entertaining, not full of action or tension.For some reason, they also found it funny to insert occasional Alien references and even full scenes, seeing those really hurt me.I won't say they did not try, but this is clearly the case of ""this looked so much better on paper"" or ""oh, this is how it turned out?"".",Breach

22,blackmamba99971,Not on my high list,1,20 December 2020,"This is what happens when an amature screen writer comes up with. Nothing but a jock filled, foul mouthed, grand stand, mosh pit kind of film. Bruce has really let his standards drop as of late. It doesn't take a genius to write sentences and replace important words with the four letter ones as a means of being lazy. Most of the film had some action to keep an interest, and the only thing that was even remotely satisfying was the cro room.Aside from the obvious the characters needed a whole lot of work when they presented their lines.In the first ten minutes I couldn't stand the loud obnoxious speeches of the old haggard soldiers trying to compare war stories with one another. If I didn't know better, that the screen writer was someone sent overseas and came home deciding to write something other than what he experienced in another country. Except he chose to use the Sci-ci trope.This was a bad movie. A bad investment. What surprised me though was when they first made their hump into hyperspace. The scene where bruce was sitting in front of a very dirty, and scratched up port window. Who the hell made the choice of keeping such trashy appearances? On an angle shot it looked like it was what everyone else was thinking.... nothing but polymer plastic.The sets were down right shabby and on any other ship I have seen of past sci-fi flicks, that the pipes were held in place using bracket hooks. I have to give this one out of ten stars mainly for the theme of the film. The plot has been overdone on so many levels in other movies as well as giving a thumbs down for both bruce and thomas jane.

Which is down to the Directing...you see in something like this, there's no need to see the set because it's just the same dull grey/green flat lighting everywhere, you need tight, fast, wobbly, whip pan, out of focus shots to give suspense and a feeling of dread. Instead we get static midshot cut to midshot continuously. It's dreadful. There's also no atmosphere and little to no music.

Produced by the same pair that wrote this tripe, this is not their 1st writing or producing credit, isn't the point of doing something to get better at it, if you're not learning from the previous bad work & are just going to keep writing & producing more garbage then the only thing you're going to get better at is creating more garbage, at least strive to make the movie as good as the trailer.",Breach

Now I have.Think Event Horizon has love with The Room and you'll find Breach somewhere in that.Thank you for becoming a comedic actor by accident Brucey.,Breach
34,TheRadiobox,Entertains but breaches no new ground,5,17 March 2021,"Breach was directed by John Suits, written by Corey Large and Edward Drake, and stars Cody Kearsley, Bruce Willis, Rachel Nichols, Callan Mulvey, Timothy V. Murphy, Kassandra Clementi, Johnny Messner, and Thomas Jane. It's about a group of workers on a spaceship fighting to survive the outbreak of an alien mutation.The Plot: Little of Breach is new, but the way the movie seems to revel in that fact, embracing the familiarity and cliche is what provides most of the mileage for Breach. It entertains with a smirk like one of its stars. Earth is dying for the millionth time in a movie and Noah (Kearsley) and Hayley (Clementi) are among the few to get on the last ship to ""New Earth."" Admiral King (Jane) and most of the others go into cryo, leaving Stanley (Murphy) to watch over the blue-collar few, naturally. Mechanics Clay (Willis), Blue (Messner), and Teek (Mulvey); and medic Chambers (Nichols) are left awake. Midway, a mutagen is released, infecting Blue among others. More people become infected and the conscious passengers are left to concoct a solution and find the person who planted the mutagen in a not-too-dissimilar fashion from 82's the Thing before they arrive at New Earth.The Characters: Exactly like the plot, the characters in Breach are callbacks to sci-fi/horror/thriller classics, with the Thing being the one drawn from the most. References and carbon-copying can't save the characters, unlike the plot. Noah is a stowaway on the last ship just trying to blend in until his arrival at New Earth so he and Hayley can start a family. Normally this would be enough to carry a character, but since Hayley is safely tucked away in cryo for the majority of the runtime, half the stakes are erased for Noah. Clay is a drunken hardass ex-soldier escaping his failures, taking to moonshine instead of work; but he can still fight. Everyone else is cardboard. Some characters give vague insight into their personalities via offhanded lines about their screwups but they don't get much aside from that. Performances are generally good, finding Willis fully engaged here, laughing and having a good time; and the rest do what they can with what they have.The Thrills: Suits intends for Breach to work on two levels: the ""plague"" and its presence on the ship, and the mystery of who put it there in the first place. In half of those two ways, Suits succeeds. The mutagen that infects the passengers proves to be the better executed threat because of the effects it has on them, which are also pulled straight from the Thing, including the infected dissolving from the inside out; allowing the parasitic mass of alien to control the body as it wishes. The infected can't be killed with bullets, only put down temporarily, which is another example of the ""been there, done that"" nature of the movie; but it's a serviceable antagonist that's given ample reason to be taken out as soon as possible. What doesn't work is the mystery element. Since all of two characters are given any substantive traits, the question surrounding the saboteur remains open as it should, but the script never bothers to point fingers or even hint at who it may be; saving the answer for a late reveal that comes too little too late.The Technics: Suits and the producers of the movie couldn't pool enough money together to satisfy the requirements of the script, that much is obvious. Set design on the ship is passably presented with an industrial and brutalist look, but it's the clearly limited number of those sets that make a lot of Breach's scenes feel repetitious as the actors walk around the same corners and into the same rooms which are intended to be different. CGI is readily apparent too. The detailed modeling of exterior shots of the ship can't cover up the stock flashes of gunfire, regular fire, spraying blood, and tentacular infection which makes some scenes look made-for-TV quality. Large and Drake's script fails in the pacing department too, which is a major blow to Breach. A lot of time is spent setting up Clay's moonshining and Blue's tendency to slack off instead of establishing more interesting characters or the big bad. While the lightheartedness partially remedies the drag, it's not enough to overlook it.Aping classics has worked for many movies in the past, but it only partly works for Breach which wears its influences on both sleeves. It's an entertaining watch thanks to its brainlessness and some committed performances but it's rarely the blast it should be.57/100",Breach
35,nebk,3rd Rate Garbage Fest,2,18 December 2020,"Anti-Life is mostly a complete waste of time, space and film. In the 2240s a space ship leaves a plague infested earth carrying the future inhabitants of new earth. 180 days from their destination a skeleton crew is running the ship while the passengers are in hyper sleep. Soon the crew members start dying and killing eachother and the survivors end up battling an alien life form that overtakes and imitates its host and is trying to kill them all.The movie is badly filmed with terrible sound and poor visual effects which are similar to what bad sci-fi movies had in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The editing is choppy as well. The movie basically borrows ideas from The Thing, Alien, Pandorum and many other superior films and copies some elements poorly. Actors like Bruce Willis, Rachel Nichols, Collin Mullvey and Thomas Jane among others have little to do and have terrible dialogue and story to contend with.There are a few chuckles but other than that there are hardly any redeeming points to this.

They had a chance to make something fun and a classic or at least get a cult following but they blew it. Actors are fine, everybody did good, even Bruce Willis (though he looked tired and a bit bored most of the time).

The story is a rip off of every alien or zombie movie ever made. I liked the characters cause the acting was good, but the weakest part were the zombie aliens. The extras gave over the top corny performances. And because of the creatures were just rip offs of other well done monster movies, the action sequences were boring.

I'm sure this was shot on a very limited budget but its difficult to suspend disbelief when you are watching a spaceship with concrete walls and chipboard hyper sleep chambers.Bruce Willis is actually in this one quite a bit, rather then the one scene films he usually appears in these days, but he doesn't really have much to do and most scenes are just him sipping from a hip flask and watching someone else work. I suppose you could watch this as a drinking game film and take a drink every time Bruce does, maybe thats what the writers were going for.The plot doesn't seem to make much sense, why would you need five janitors to clean the bathrooms of 15 other people. How much mess can they make - clearly a lot as the protagonist has to spend a year cleaning toilets. Odd.I thought the directors last film, 3022, was pretty good and was surprised its the same director of photography on this film as it just looks so bad and the shots are terrible.I can only guess perhaps the budget wasn't there for this film or it was shot in a hurry for whatever reason.

This is somewhere in the middle.
When you see ""Willis"", Racheal Nichols, and Thomas Jayne in a SciFi, you'd expect you'd get quality, especially if you add in supporting actors from the Marvel-Verse. sadly the technical side of the film is let down by some poor choices, both in the ""Lets do a whole film hand-held"" decision, and then the dynamic range of the final audio mix, leaving viewers needing to reach for the volume control to hear the dialog in quiet scenes, then feel ears battered in the action sequences.
The lighting and props would be fine, if this had been released in the 80's or 90's, and if it had been shot on film or one of the film-like digital cameras, instead of the Red listed in the technical details.
The dialog isn't poor, it's bland, and it shows in the performances.

77,troy-boulton,So bad that it's putrid,1,20 February 2021,"OMFG. Bruce Willis is an actor that a director has to know how to use to get the best out of. He has the acting chops, comic timing, and a star-quality presence, but to get an audience to buy what Willis is selling, the director has to package it right. This director couldn't wrap a Rubik's cube, let alone a complex beast like Willis, and he clearly couldn't afford a gift bag in which to hide his lack of packaging skills. Hence, Willis comes off as a cheap cardboard cutout, on which the film unfortunately blew the majority of its budget.Thrown in with a discount-store 'junior Colin Farell and Jodie Foster knockoff Chinese Action Figurine' value pack, Willis doesn't even phone it in. In fact, I'm not sure if he even could be gifted with a generous ""he texted it in"". Thomas Jane gets off lightly by spending the great majority of the film in cryosleep - he may be able to wash off his association with this fetid puddle of space horror trope-vomit, given enough time.This film lacks any originality, and is so mono-dimensional that any (possible?) attempt to tip its hat to the genre's greats telegraphs desperation, not pizzaz. The sets look like an elementary school cardboard diorama, and nothing is done to meaningfully disguise its low-budget nature. Foley frequently neglects to mask hollow, wooden clunks and thuds on walls and surfaces that should be metal. Lighting is flat and atmosphere-destroying (I've seen better-lit budget 1990s cable soap operas). Colour grading seems to favour uneven, generic ""point and shoot"" settings. Special effects are, well, bad. Some of the monster stuff is actually ok when hidden in the mist, but the ships and space scenes are worse than budget Dr who ships from the 70s, and effects such as muzzle flare look painted in with 80s paintbox technology.I not sure what this film thinks it is, but it isn't.

After watching the truly execrable 'Cosmic Sin' by the same director, my other half and I decided to we had to watch 'Anti-Life' (or 'Breach) just to see if it was equally terrible. And you know what? Shockingly, it wasn't!That's not to say 'Anti-life' is good, by any means. It's actually pretty dreadful, but in comparison to 'Cosmic Sin', it at least had a vaguely coherent storyline, and progressed at a reasonable pace. Given that Bruce Willis and Rachel Nichols were in this for most of its run time (rather than the usual 'I could've shot my scenes in a day'), and that they're both good actors, I don't know why they didn't simply re-write the script to make them the leads. They would have been far better than the rather ineffectual unknown who plays the actual lead, and his even worse-acting romantic interest.Essentially the whole thing is an ultra-low-budget 'Alien' clone, with a dash of 'The Thing', already done numerous times in the 80s and 90s. It's so low budget, I would be amazed if it cost more than... I don't know... $100k? And 90% of that would've been on Bruce, Thomas Jane and Rachel Nichols.It's such a low budget production, that they've used every old trick in the book. Packing crates for shining light through, various randomly shaped packaging items on the walls, spray painted to match the colour of the set, etc... As such, it's actually a fun example of how young up-and-coming film students can create sci-fi sets with zero budget!!Even at 'Anti Life's worst, you can play 'spot the polystyrene packaging on the wall', which keeps things fun. Oh, and don't forget the painted NERF guns with badly composited muzzle flashes!It's all pretty bad, but it IS entertaining in a silly, cheesy, low budget way, most reminiscent of 90s made-for-tv movies, when poor CGI was just becoming available for low-budget efforts to throw at the screen.What can I say? I've seen a LOT worse, and it was more entertaining than The Last Jedi (My favourite stunningly-low-bar comparison movie, for all bad movies to be compared against). I didn't fall asleep before the end, which is something I can't even say of some Marvel movies. ;-)",Breach

Since there is little CGI i guess it's fine also. Same with the environment, and decorations. The rest of the movie is bad.The plot is terrible, the motives and actions of people are idiotic, the villain and monsters are virtually flat. At times this movie feels like a parody, as none of the jokes, or conversations were executed well.It just feels cheap on almost all levels. And it's a shame really, because if some of the scenes would have been deleted, a better monster was chosen with some suspense added - this could have been a ""pandorum"" lookalike.In general I cannot recommend this to anyone except those few who are hardcore fans of Bruce Willis. All of the rest should avoid this movie.With better writing, more suspense and less stupid and forced action this could have been watchable as at times it does feel like a horror movie.

97,deltaforce7,One Star rating is ten stars more than this flick deserves,1,28 December 2020,"Where to start...
I could not believe my eyes and ears that this is an actual movie and not an overboard, hateful, disgusted parody of some real bad movie!
I mean, for a while my mind flatly refused to accept the inevitable truth that this flick was for real, that this wasn't some sort of handbook on how NOT to make movies.
Seriously, if the makers of this puke had to borrow or steal some old props from a number of rather well known sci-fi movies (such as, obviously, Aliens, Cube and others), then this must've been a poorly made attempt to parody all those B-grade knock-off flicks of many actually popular films.
When you find a number of top-grade actors playing so horribly badly in a movie with SFX not making it to the level of the first silent sci-fi films, with dialogue obviously written by someone suffering from a debilitating mental development issue, with such disregard for any and all basic scientific legitimacy, then it doesn't come easy for you to believe that all this is not a joke.
And what about all the looooong, life-draining dialogue? What's up with light and scenery? Someone tell me, what's up with those CO2 rifles that do not produce recoil, smoke, and spent shells? Them blue CO2 rifles evidently had their ejection port covers closed during shooting.
Zombies? Again? How could someone sane fund another lower-B grade zombie movie???
Also, why would a 'sleeper' star transport ship have such enormously wide corridors, such tall ceilings -- such wasteful abundance of unused life-supporting space?
It is painfully obvious that everyone involved in making of this terrible mistake of a movie has absolutely no scientific knowledge and no common sense. And no movie-making abilities, too.

It's always been that way, and he does it well. When he doesn't, it's because he has crap to work with. Most ""science fiction"" movies are utter garbage, or at least just barely watchable if you know how to drink your way through them.

I rarely review anymore because over the years there are more and more whiners and princesses, and self-entitled primadonnas who are 100% negative, and that is NOT a ""review"" of a film! Complaining and belittling of any creative effort, no matter HOW seemingly bad something might be doesn't create a whole picture of an experience using the objective mindset needed to accurately explain an 'opinion' that is worthy of being taken seriously. Meaning, that too often it's ALL about the reviewer's emotions and expectations and creative 'fragility', and NOT about the movie itself. This was fun and perfectly campy, well written well acted. Everything was pretty believable and didn't insult your intelligence by pretending it was anything other than it was. It was simple and genuine and the writer knew his characters fairly well. And he wrote accordingly. The strongest arm of the movie is that it had genuine suspense! I was certainly not expecting that. Sadly, there are more and more princesses in the world writing reviews and less and less castles for them to feel safe in so they won't be SO disappointed and bereaved when a movies falls short of their narcissistic demand that it should have been better.

""Breach"", to me, very much felt like a low-budget science fiction horror movie along the lines of the ones they used to make in the 80s and 90s. It's dark and gritty and, what I found to be refreshing this day and age, not politically correct at all.One reviewer complained the sets look bad, but I thought they appeared exactly like I expect (and want) the inside of a space ship to look like in a bleak, futuristic world where Earth has gone to hell and mankind is struggling to survive. Both it and its crew reminded me of ""Event Horizon"" since the atmosphere and look of ""Breach"" are very similar to that and also reminiscent of ""Alien 3"". Maybe those two won't go down in history as the best science fiction movies ever made, but I, for one, still enjoyed them and I would much rather watch something like ""Breach"" than all of those clean and realistic ones that are being produced nowadays, like ""the Martian"" or ""Gravity."" Back in the 80s and 90s they made many dark, low budget sci fi movies, which were not very realistic at all, but that wasn't the point. They all took place in a bleak, hopeless future where humanity had destroyed all the beauty in the world and life was basically a daily struggle for survival in whatever setting the movie took place. But after ""The Matrix"" came out, science fiction changed (although, ironically, those films take place in a similar setting) and the only movies I can think of which were made in that style in the 2000s are ""Doomsday"" and ""The Gene Generation"", although they used a bit too much CGI for my taste. 2018's ""Death Race 4: Beyond Anarchy"" was better in that way and it was very refreshing to me to having been able to watch another film that tries to keep that particular niche alive. As for Bruce Willis, I thought he was very good in ""Breach"" and delivered pretty much what you'd expect from him in this role: the witty, tough as nails anti-hero that he's become famous for.So give this movie a chance. Of course it's not as good as ""Alien"" or even ""Event Horizon"", but watching it, it brought back memories from when I was a teenager, checking out the science fiction and horror sections of my local video store, looking for exactly this kind of film. I'm happy it got made if only for allowing me to experience that sensation again years later when there aren't even any more of those magical places left in the world.",Breach

First the good:
-good actors
-good props and set deck
-good lighting
-good post production (vfx and colour correction)
-good cameras and audioAnd now what destroys all that in a heart beat
-Bad scripting, seemingly the first version of the script was what was used in the final film.
-unclear confusing story, this goes hand in hand with scripting.
-unclear and confusing dialogue, also, a writing and scripting problem.
-no story boarding so shots look mediocre. Did they even change the lenses on the camera? at that point might As well shoot it on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.
-the directing, the entire movie feels like every first take made it into final.
-the director of photography, what ate you even doing? This was boring and painful to watch.Clearly the production got decent funding, cut corners, don't bother hiring additional writers, storyboard artists, or anyone who knew what was happening on the set, paid for an a lister, backed the profits, and extra cash, and walked away...Kinda a great way to make money during a pandemic if I should say so lol.",Breach

Unfortunately, I got to see neither the one nor the other.
The opening plot shows a world on the brink of destruction. Environmental destruction, pollution and a virus threaten to wipe out humanity.
As usual in such films, only a privileged few are allowed to take the plunge into another world. Unfortunately, there are also opponents here who want to sabotage the flight.
And this is where it starts to become illogical. Where the being brought along comes from is not mentioned in any way. It seems more like an alien life form than a creature bred in a laboratory. The behaviour of the crew in the face of this threat is grossly illogical in places.
The fact that one of the main characters only thinks of the ultimate weapon against the monsters when it is already out of reach borders on debility. As a substitute, a homemade schnapps must be used, which is mixed from rocket fuel and other things. Even in the near future, these ingredients are unlikely to be edible,
The ending is also illogical and should hopefully not point to a second part.Bruce Willis must owe a lot of people a lot of favours or be in the dumps to accept such film offers.

The writing is bare bones soulless drivel, but that's pretty typical among these low rent scifi movies. To make the poorly paced writing worse, however, is some absolutely awful editing. The first 30 minutes of the movie feels like someone went at it with a chainsaw, leaving you wondering if you dozed off and missed something. It's possible that the script alone may have been merely bad if it had decent editing, rather than truly awful.
The walls are papered with flat characters that serve nothing more than to become fodder later. Character motivations are flimsy at best.
The camera work is at times passable, and at times seem like someone forgot they were operating a camera.
Color grading ranges from jarring and off putting to ""I recognize that preset"".
It's so predictable I could have told you the ending at the 30 minute mark.
It's entirely forgettable. I just finished watching it about 10 minutes ago and already can't remember any of the character's names.This film basically offers nothing memorable or noteworthy, not even brainless action fun.

191,LNAndersen,Hilarious Technology Optimism,8,19 July 2021,"99% of all films about space and technology are pessimistic. ""The Breach"" seems to me optimistic about technology if probably somewhat ambiguous when it comes to space and the future. This low-budget film is by far the best about these topics, second only to ""Interstellar"" which is also much more serious i tone.Admittedly, Bruce in his later years needs a good director to direct him, but as in ""Death Wish"" here it succeeds and Bruce's performance as a result is more than decent. Furthermore most of the other actors are top-notch and what we have is a very entertaining film. Especially the first hour and the ending I find hilarious. At first it may seem like just pure entertainment but I must say it has grown on me since I first saw it some months ago. It's not that it's especially deep but nor is it the opposite. When I first saw it I would have given it 5 or 6 out of 10 but maybe because generally I don't care so much about how expensive films look, I think there's more to it than maybe first meets the eye. The fact that I find the actors and the dialogue so good and funny is for me the most essential.I could imagine that some of the reviewers who give this a negative rating find the masculinity here a tad too toxic. For me they found just the right balance.In fact ""The Breach"" should in no way be seen as controversial and is a prime example of how a film can have a lot of humor without seeking the limits of free expression. Certainly compared to the 80's it's very harmless.",Breach

195,tsode,Was this satire?,2,23 January 2021,"Even with a film like this, on a small budget, I am sure that a lot of work and effort was involved. I watched Breach right through to the end. Which is more than I can say for a lot of even worse films. So if you worked on this movie, good for you.Alas though, I can't let this one slide, when better movies were being made on similar budgets, 30 or 40 years ago...As a longtime fan of the space-horror subgenre, I'm only giving this 2 stars.This a really terrible, cheap-looking, silly film. Was it a joke? A barely coherent plot is dressed up with terrible CGI effects. From the ships to the machine gun blasts, to the fake CGI flamethrower fire. I've seen better special effects in Jimmy Kimmel skits.In the 80s, with the limitations of the practical FX of the day, a lot of scifi-horror films were made on tiny budgets that still managed to look far more authentic than this. Check out films like Moon 44, or DeepStar Six. I miss that amazing model work. Breach just seems lazy in comparison.Heck, even check out the recent short films based on ""Alien"", that were made with tiny budgets.Yet here we are in 2021. And Breach is an embarrassment compared with all of the above. Don't believe any mild praise you see for it, either. Some other reviewers appear to have lost their minds, or they'll just excuse anything.From the action, to the monster, to the acting, I wondered if I was being ""punk'd"" the whole way through this. At one point, our heroes go from shooting at the bad guys, to having an all-in fist fight brawl with the nasties. I couldn't stop laughing. The first act does build some low-level interest and tension. But there's far too much student-film on display here, to take this seriously. Nearly every scene contains something amateurish. Incessant lens flare, goofy acting, empty dialogue...How on Earth (or in Space) did Bruce and Thomas ever agree to this?2/10.If I had made this film myself, in college, I'd be mildly pleased with myself.

Ed Wood could not launch his career sunk by critics, but the director of this film seems to enjoy unknown privileges. Why? Doesn't Hollywood say ""you're only as good as your last job""? For unknown reasons, this terrible director and producer goes on and on working with stars the size of Bruce Willies. (Poor Bruce) Aren't there better directors in Hollywood? there must be thousands much more talented who are being ignored. Why does this person have a job? Weren't there better and brighter scripts to film or invest money in? Unfortunately I think this more often every day.
I always try to see things from a positive point of view but it is getting harder and harder. I hoped that this movie was actually a joke, and I tried to see it from this perspective ... was useless. And those who invested money, don't they regret it? Please Mr. Willis, don't end your professional career by burying yourself under this heap of bad productions. This is not cinema, nor entertainment, it is a scam. A scam for those who invested the money, a scam for the audience, a scam for the professionals who worked in it ... What is happening to the film industry? Is the imagination over? Is this movie the best they can do? Really? What is the excuse in this current age, for not doing things right? Not to make good CG?

Blurry non descript shape and to be honest I needed a drink to get me through this movie and by the end I was totally spannered so found the end really difficult to recall this morning albeit in a hazey, ""what on earth did I watch last night, seriously 1 hour and 32 minutes of my life I will never get back""

356,Yodel_lay_hee_hoo,What a frustrating waste of time and talent,2,21 December 2020,"I have actually watched this movie twice, and trust me when I tell you that it doesn't get any better with repeat viewings.I have nothing against low-budget indie flicks, and I have watched enough of them to know that they can be just as enjoyable as big budget, studio-backed blockbusters - but this one did everything wrong.Okay, almost everything, because I actually liked the set design and the lighting; I'm a sucker for grimy, grungy sci-fi settings, and Breach delivered on that front. Some commenters have mentioned how cheap the sets looked, but I used to be a Trekkie; I was 100% willing to run with a reactor consisting of three red neon lines, and accept the general aesthetic as fitting a ship where crew comfort wasn't exactly a priority.But everything else was a disappointment.Plenty of other people have already mentioned the CGI and the poor editing and pacing, but the filmmakers apparently didn't even care about a trivial little thing called 'continuity' either, and at one point, Commander Stanley is referred to as 'Captain Stanley'. It's such a small thing, so why couldn't they be bothered to get it right?And speaking of small things; they even managed to spell one of their own actors' names wrong at the start of the movie, which is a very special kind of cluck up.The fight choreography is also poor, but I wasn't expecting much in that department anyway. Nor was I expecting much from Mr Willis, and yet he still somehow managed to disappoint.In fact, the acting is the most frustrating part of the entire experience--even more so than the storyline, which we'll get to next. The filmmakers squandered good actors, although how much of the blame should lie with the writers and how much with the director, I don't know. What I do know is that someone should have:
a) told Tim V Murphy and Thomas Jane to tone down their cartoonish accents.
b) given Rachel Nichols more to do than be Willis' little shadow.
c) actually told the actors what kind of movie they were making, because this movie just doesn't know what it wants to be.Is it a serious space-based horror? Kearsley, Clementi, Nichols and Mulvey seem to think so, and they're all (re)acting accordingly. Then you have Murphy and Jane who are just chewing the scenery because apparently they didn't get the same memo, and the aforementioned Mr Willis who is just there, whose acting ranges from 'grumpy' to 'surly' regardless of what is supposedly happening around him, and whose one-liners are simply cringe-inducing.And the less said about the Admiral's 'elite commando team', the better...Now, onto the storyline, and I was again 100% onboard with the premise. I didn't care that it wasn't original, so long as it was well-executed and entertaining. Well, it was neither. Character motivations are paper-thin at best, incomprehensible at worst. Characterisations seem to flip on a dime, too - so you didn't care about leaving 19 billion people behind, but you DO care about 300,000 on this ship? Right. The alien gets free shortly after leaving Earth but waits months to start wreaking havoc? Give me a break.You know, writing all this out makes me think something must have happened at some stage of the production. Last-minute rewrites, perhaps. I just can't believe that anyone would set out to create the mess this turned out to be, unless they were aiming to deliberately tank some careers, and I feel genuinely sorry for the less well-known cast members; I hope they don't end up being haunted by this thing.Lastly, I'd say watch it drunk, but I tried that the second time round and it was still bad.

Fortunately for the costume and makeup team, the aliens are zombies, and the zombies are people who ate too much black licorice.They did a little better on the ship interior. Except it's pretty clear they only made one room, and one L-shaped hallway. Towards the climax, we see the zombie aliens attain their final form, and this must be the entire special effects budget, because by the end of the film, we've got some kind of stop motion 1933-King Kong lookin garbage, englarged with MS-Paint, and greenscreened into the background under a layer of dense fog.True to form, our heroes never seem to discover any way to kill the zombliens. There's several obvious options they ignore in favor of shooting nerf guns at them (props guy couldn't afford some black spray paint?).

Its very very obvious that these are paycheck films for Bruce. Its not a hidden fact that he will only work for an enormous price tag and these are the producers (who aren't very good at writing films) willing to fit that bill and everything else is chicken feed left for the rest of creatives. Blame everyone for continuing to watch them because they see Bruce. Maybe pay attention to smaller productions that can evenly spread the effort to make a decent film. As a B-movie this is much better than the majority of others I've seen though. As I actually like B-movies and watch them, with the majority have terrible dialogue, and sound editing. This actually excels at sound that since a lot of action is happening off screen and the VFX are not doing it any justice but sadly they are very bad unfortunately which is breaking the entire filmmaking illusion.

This film is clearly competent and a fun no thought process needed type of film' reminiscent of the 90 style films made for a lot more than I'm sure this budget had even back then.

Started out okay. Some pandemic on earth, people bailing on interstellar ships. Got it. Guy sneaks aboard. How? Not really explained; just shows up.
People enter cryo-sleep by simply flooding the chamber with some foggy gas. They come out of it by simply opening the chamber.
The alien... Where'd it come from? No explanation. One guy confesses to bringing it aboard, but how? When? No explanation.They try shooting the alien-possessed people. Bullets don't stop them. Nobody thinks of shooting them in the eyes, or spinal cord. Apparently their training says shoot the torso, so that's all they can do.First few 'dead' infected people take lots of time to become animated again. By the end, it takes only seconds.Moxacell (corrosive cleaner). Had some potential there when a guy discovered it dissolves the aliens in seconds. Guy discovered that by splashing some on an alien above him, but somehow none of it splashed back down on him. Then they load moonshine made with Moxacell into flame-throwers to shoot blue flame (with some success) at the aliens instead of just splashing some on them.
Blue flame somehow works better on human-infected aliens than it does on a reassembled alien.Alien reassembling; they sit and watch as human body parts magically draw closer together on the floor. Bio-magnetism? Hmm... Let's not keep the parts separate, lets just run away and let them assemble into something bigger.Escape pod from a ship traveling faster than the speed of light has no trouble decelerating so it doesn't smash into the destination planet at lightspeed.Lame. Not thought out at all. Apparently everyone leaving earth in 2251 or whatever is an idiot.Oh, then the ""New Earth"" arrival... Giant alien (think Godzilla). Girl says, ""What do we do?""

The same goes for Rachel Nichols, she's a lovely wonderful brilliant actress who was under used in this role (I might add) the same goes for Callan Mulvey and Timothy Murphy, again underused as they are both good method actors..But for me, what broke the 4th wall wasn't the effects or the god awful lighting or their use of grey corridors, but the use of the Red Dwarf bedrooms, in fact I'm pretty sure all the corridor scenes were stolen from the Red Dwarf set too.The alien, doing then black goop eye thing was straight out of the X files as was the whole alien premise, but nevertheless a damn fine Sunday afternoon movie with a decent level of suspense. Breaking the suspension of disbelief, the autopsy scene is simply laughable, so why don't they get real specialists in to block out these scenes... finally, does no one know what a headshot is ????In fact now I've gone back and looked at it, watch any Red Dwarf episode and you'll see what I mean about the sets..Nevertheless, I'd still go drinking with Bruce or Rachel",Breach

Uninteresting characters and cheap effects.Fun fact: during the first part of the movie you see several shots of the mess hall at the ship where on all tables there's a metal waste bin with holes... from IKEA! I recognized them immediately, because I have one myself. It made me laugh out loud and I couldn't take the movie seriously after that. I kept thinking about it. What sci-fi filmmaker uses something like that without adapting it so that viewers will not immediately recognize it?After watching for about 20 minutes, I decided I did not want to waste my time any further on this, so I stopped.

I think Thomas Jane made a smart move by allowing his name to be second from the bottom during the credits. Pretty sure Willis and Jane just showed up the day of and were handed the script. They did not act at all, and the remainder of the cast tried to carry the movie. How it has even managed almost 3 stars is actually scary, and shows that some people have depressingly low standards for their entertainment. Pro- tip: avoid this movie like the plague and just watch Alien. I would give this film 0 stars if that was an option.

Although the (predictable) story arc could have been fun to watch had it been treated with a certain humor, the dialogue is too stereotypical and lacks any originality to the point of becoming boring.The cinematography is so bad that the image lacks depth and volume and I won't even talk about the colors.At first I thought I was watching a student movie, ready to forgive the cheesy sets and special effects but an hour and a half of this convinced me of the lack of seriousness the whole production crew demonstrated by trying to make a movie for which a budget of at least $10M was required just for CGI for the project.I would also condemn to the gallows the editor but I believe beheading the director would be sufficient.As a principle, I always watch a movie until the very end and this one made me regret it.

Sadly, I wish I had not.The acting is terrible. Even Bruce's. I think he got paid by the word, so they gave him as few as lines as possible. He had to have lost a bet to even show up for this movie, because he didn't even bother trying to act himself. All his lines are said in mono-tone, with no effort behind them. But that wasn't even the worst acting. It seems that either A, no one knew their lines, or B, the director made them up as they went.I'm a fan of B rated movies. But this is worse than those. In fact, if they did make this as a B rated, it would have been enjoyable. At least then you could laugh at the poorly made set. Steel doors that move around like plastic. Air tight seals that could be broken with a screw driver. Guns that never run out of ammo, or even eject a shell. A fire extinguisher turned flame thrower (Or maybe it was a potato gun).(Spoiler)
Best part is when they finally wake up. The Admiral. You think, hey, something is gonna happen now. I mean, they literally say, let flush them out the airlock. So one would think that's what is gonna happen next. The alive crew is safe in airtight doors, just bleed out the air and boom.

Low budget, poor acting, terrible CGI, awful attempt at an Alien movie.Its meant to be a colony ship with 1000 people in cryo one of the last 4 ships of the human race going to New Earth. Half way through the movie after a few incidents (and still no mention of the sleeping 1000) Bruce's character pipes up ""we've got to get off this ship"". What about the 1000 poor souls still on it. I managed to get to the 58 minute mark which was pretty good going before turning it off.Mr Willis appears in the whole movie, 2d facial expressions.

They clearly struggled for investment and ended up having to make the film on a budget of about $12 because the props look like they were bought from toys'r'us or found in the skip at universal studios and the CGI appears to have been done by a high school kid on his iPhone.I'm embarrassed for the actors involved in this project and as a piece of advice to the production team, I'm all for following your dreams but when investors are laughing at you and asking you to be removed from the office (As i assume happened for you guys...) then maybe you should question whether it really is a good idea to inflict you abortion of a movie onto the world...",Breach

With everything spray painted grey, including what looks like polystyrene packing from tv boxes glued to walls, and black and white cctv monitors, It really felt like they were 121 years in the future. The light speed jump and floating hologram head reminded a lot of a Star Wars only not as good, but then Star Wars is probably further in the future.The jokes ran out after about 90minutes and they started getting serious about dealing with their alien horde. Mostly relying on the acting, script and aviator sunglasses to carry the narrative through.When the bits of alien 'crawl' together in a 'The Thing' style. We realised the laughs were back, the dialog reinforced this and 'shock face / concerned face acting.

Uninteresting and has absolutely no screen presence. Why was he cast in this role?I clicked on this film because I am a huge fan of Bruce Willis. The movies he has been in later years have not been like Die Hard or the 5th Element ... but watchable. THIS one... I mean, what is going? And, Thomas Jane... after The Expanse, he should have had the choice of the best sci-fi projects out there. Does anyone know the backstory here? The script is so bad that surely Willis or even his agent would have rejected it. Why did they agree to this?

From cardboard sets to terrible fight scenes, from laughable dialog to unlimited ammunition guns, the whole thing is a total pathetic mess. And who didn't burst out laughing at the monster; a kindergarten papier-mâché project? You don't expect sci-fi films to necessarily follow the laws of physics but accelerating to light speed, without killing a human, takes months. The nearest star to earth is over 4 light years away, so 4 years at the speed of light not 6 months; and it doesn't have an earth like planet. And I suppose we were just left to expect they had artificial gravity on board even though Einstein tells you it's impossible as gravity is not a force like electromagnetism. The writer and director's knowledge was as poor as their film making abilities. Why were there men's public toilets on board and how did the floor get so dirty? There's only 18 of them & not all men. Why did they use the bunk room from Red Dwarf? I could go on & on but I'm exhausted just trying to work out what was going on in this excuse for entertainment.
