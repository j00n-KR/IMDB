0,SnoopyStyle,another 'found footage' movie,4,6 March 2015,"University professor Scarlett Marlowe (Perdita Weeks) is following her father's obsession to find Flamel's philosopher's stone. She barely escapes the Iranian authorities blowing up their underground caves. In Paris, she leads documentary filmmaker Benji (Edwin Hodge) and Aramaic translator George (Ben Feldman). They find Papillon (François Civil) and his group to guide them into exploring hidden catacomb tunnels under the city looking for Flamel's grave.It's another 'found footage' movie. I'm a little tired of them especially when they're not imaginative. This is definitely nothing new. It's a lot of shaky-cam moves in the dark and underground. I wonder if it would be better to shot this straight. I can imagine that it has an immersive quality if seen in a theater. That's my only positive comment because this is an unappealing unscary horror.","As Above, So Below"
1,claudio_carvalho,"Awful Camera, Silly Story",3,13 November 2015,"The archaeologist Scarlett Marlowe (Perdita Weeks) searches the Nicholas Flame's alchemical philosopher's stone and finds a rose key in Iran in Aramaic that would help her to find the stone. She meets her former boyfriend George (Ben Feldman) in Paris with her cameraman Benji (Edwin Hodge) and they conclude that the stone is below the Parisian Catacombs. They team up with the guide Papillon (François Civil); his girlfriend Souxie (Marion Lambert); and their friend Zed (Ali Marhyar) to find the spot. When they find the stone, Scarlett removes it and soon they discover that they are trapped in hell with visions of their sins and she concludes that she must return the stone to the place where it belongs.""As Above, So Below"" is another irritating low-budget found footage horror movie. The dreadful camera work is tiresome making the viewer dizzy and destroys any expectation that the viewer may have. It is hilarious to see the translation from Aramaic producing a rhyme in English. It is laughable to see the curriculum vitae of a twenty and something years old with so many specialization including in martial arts. Her stubbornness risking the lives of her team including hers is ridiculous. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Assim na Terra Como no Inferno"" (""On Earth as It Is in Hell"")","As Above, So Below"
2,nogodnomasters,THE DARKEST GATE,4,7 May 2018,"Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) is a female Indian Jones complete with a book of information given to her by her father. She comes across a new piece of evidence which is a riddle for the location of the Philosopher's Stone, ignoring the fact Harry Potter found it. Scarlett gathers a team and illegally enters the catacombs deep under Paris.This is another hand held genre. It was confusing as to who was filming as the camera is sometimes in two different rooms. In this film, the sound is bad, the lighting is low, the camera is in constant shaking mode, heads are cut off making the film nearly unwatchable.The title is a clue they use to navigate through the caves.","As Above, So Below"
3,kosmasp,Should we go in there? It's like dark ....,6,19 January 2015,"Not to mention that there are sections where people have not come back from ... Well as with many other horror movies, this is not winning most intelligent characters (or decisions made). But you'll expect that (if not don't even bother watching), so other than that this is pretty decent. Plus our main character is supposed to be sort of intelligent with history on her resume.Not to mention a back-story that makes it all ""logical"". So even the one character who says (more than once) he won't come with the group of people going underground, he finally does. Something about no connection (who'd have thought?) down there. So while it takes quite a while until the story gets going and there are a lot of people fed up with the hand-held nature of the movie, once it gets going and story flaws aside, you can be entertained. Maybe I should say shocked/scared, but you get the point (don't expect to care too much about the characters, introduction and everything left aside).","As Above, So Below"
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Unique, enjoyable, somehow",7,17 March 2019,"I wasn't expecting much to be honest, as the whole found footage genre seems to have died a death, but this is surprisingly good. It begins in dramatic fashion, and for the most part doesn't let up, anyone that suffers with claustrophobia or a feeling of being trapped will appreciate the efforts of the film, or not. Some creepy scenes, I liked the part where the phone was ringing, that was atmospheric, as well as the push deeper into the cave. Perdita Weeks was excellent in the role.This was rather good. 7/10","As Above, So Below"
5,jboothmillard,"As Above, So Below",4,5 March 2018,"The poster for this scary movie was very recognisable, the Eiffel Tower upside with a pattern of skulls underneath, it was obvious where the movie was set, but I didn't know what to expect, I hoped for something relatively scary or interesting. Basically in Iran in Aramaic, young alchemy scholar Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) discovers a riddle on the head stone of Nicholas Flamel, the alchemist believed to have discovered the Philosopher's Stone, and finds a rose key that may help her to find the historical stone. The tombstone riddle pinpoints the location of the Philosopher's Stone as being in Paris, France, she travels there, meeting up with her former boyfriend George (Ben Feldman) and her cameraman Benji (Edwin Hodge). They conclude that the stone is below the Parisian Catacombs, with their guide Papillon (François Civil); his girlfriend Souxie (Marion Lambert); and their friend Zed (Ali Marhyar), they go into the deep uncharted tunnels. But the explorers get more than they bargained for, when they do find the stone and remove it, they are trapped in the hellish underground maze, with demonic visions and chambers collapsing on them. One by one, team members venture too far, and suffer bloody deaths, until only Scarlett, George and Zed are left, and they realise that the only way out, strangely, is to go down, as seen earlier on a Gnostic Star of David, an artefact symbolising the notion ""As above, so below"". Eventually the remaining survivors find what appears to be a manhole cover above them, they jump through it, and find themselves the right way up on the streets of Notre Dame, they are now safe. The story is inspired by Dante's Inferno stuff, and the film is presented as a ""found footage"" movie, there are some reasonable gory and Blair Witch style apparition moments that keep you interested, it is not the scariest thing you will watch, but it's not a bad horror. Okay!","As Above, So Below"
6,Woodyanders,Frightening descent into the abyss,8,2 October 2018,"A group of explorers decide to investigate a series of catacombs underneath the city of Paris, France in search of treasure. However, their journey underground becomes a hellish ordeal when they are forced to face their personal demons. Director John Erick Dowdle, who also co-wrote the compact script with Drew Dowdle, takes time to develop the characters, relates the compelling story at a steady pace, and adroitly milks plenty of claustrophobic tension and spooky gloom-doom atmosphere from the creepy actual catacombs location. Moreover, this film acquires considerable unsettling power not only from the way it slowly, but surely becomes more bleak, brutal, and nightmarish as the plot unfolds, but also from the inspired and effective use of eerie ambient noise. The sound acting from the capable cast rates as another substantial asset, with especially praiseworthy contributions from Perdita Weeks as the eager Scarlett, Ben Feldman as reluctant translator George, Francois Civil as brash guide Papillon, Edwin Hodge as surly cameraman Benji, and Ali Marhyar as the easygoing Zed. Leo Hinstin's hand-held cinematography gives this picture a raw and bracing sense of intimacy and immediacy. A genuinely harrowing film.","As Above, So Below"
7,BA_Harrison,Abandon hope all ye who watch this.,4,4 September 2016,"Searching for Nicolas Flamel's fabled philosopher's stone, a vital ingredient in the practice of alchemy, young archaeologist Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) discovers a series of clues that point to the bone-strewn catacombs that lie deep beneath the streets of Paris. Assembling a team of plucky urban explorers, she ventures into the dark network of tunnels where horror awaits.As Above, So Below references classical art and literature and historical legends in an attempt to add a degree of intelligence to proceedings, but what director John Erick Dowdle's film ultimately boils down to is an oft confusing, very dark (as in you can't see what is happening) and derivative mess of a film (equal parts The Blair Witch Project, National Treasure, and The Descent) that basically consists of an hour and a half of repetitive meandering through confined passageways while assorted inexplicable supernatural occurrences terrify the characters (but rarely the viewer).Dowdle does admittedly conjure up quite a bit of atmosphere along the way, making the absolute most of his creepy, claustrophobic location, whilst the deciphering of long lost clues and the discovery of hidden treasure adds a modicum of fun, but the action, much of which proves as difficult to unravel as an Aramaic riddle, soon becomes tiresome, while the over-used found footage/mockumentary style only serves to annoy.","As Above, So Below"

Descending into the dank, dark and bone covered twisted catacombs under the busy streets; these explorers hope to find a cache of treasure in the uncharted passages cluttered with bones. Wondering about all the souls that belonged to those bones, this dim-witted troupe stumbles around and feel they have discovered some dark secret. A cave-in blocks the entrance they used and quickly madness, paranoia and fear begins taking a toll. Is the only exit to be found a gateway to hell itself?

9,LeonLouisRicci,Unnecessarily Making the Audience Physically Sick from Shaky Camera,3,19 January 2015,"There seems to be Two Audiences out there. Those that can Enjoy the constant Shaking Camera and those that can not. It's a Cheap and quickly Boring Effect that supposes a ""You are There"" Feel but after a few Minutes it is a obvious Pretentious Presentation. After All, once the Documentary Feel is Presented the rest of the Running Time is a gut turning Display that induces Headaches, Nausea, and Sickness.There is Talent at Work here but They and every other Movie Maker that Thinks that the Shaky Camera is ""Cool"" are Delusional. Why Alienate the Majority of the Audience with another ""Found Footage"" Format. Been there, done that, so it really isn't Clever Anymore, it is just Lazy and Familiar.So Why Choose to make Movies in this most God-Awful, B-Movie Style. Why Assault the Audience with Vomit Inducing free for all Camera Movement that will Alienate a lot of People. If You Enjoy this Format that here is 100% Un-Tethered Camera, Bobbing and Weaving Up and Down, Side to Side, then this might be Worth a Watch because there are some Genuine Creepiness and Scares but they have absolutely Nothing to do with Shaking the Camera and would have been even Creepier and Scarier Without.The Mythical Story Concerning Alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone is Interesting and the Descent to the Gates of Hell is a Horror Movie Staple and this Could have been a very Good Take on Ancient Civilizations and Sacred Texts. Only Recommended for those that are Immune to Motion Sickness and can Tolerate the Queasy, Quick Camera Work.","As Above, So Below"
10,utgard14,Indiana Jane and the Temple of Dumb,4,28 December 2014,"Right off the bat, let me state I hated the main character here. She was annoying and unlikable. She's part of that particular breed of pretty movie heroine that is unbelievable in nearly every way. She has the expected clichéd tragic backstory. Her father committed suicide so now she's devoted to finishing his life's work and finding the mythical philosopher's stone. She's supposed to be an archaeologist yet she displays such flagrant disregard for artifacts that she lights them on fire to find a clue. She destroys chunks of the catacombs of Paris all throughout this thing and puts everybody's lives in danger without a care. She's really a piece of work. Speaking of 'tragic backstory' clichés, the lead male character also has one - his little brother drowned in a cave. So of course he is forced to go underground. There's yet another character in this who ALSO has a tragic backstory. Man, that's a lot of bad luck for these folks before the damn movie has even started.All of the characters are young attractive model types. So you kind of know there's a ceiling on how good the performances will be. Parts of this remind me of the movie Quarantine (a lame remake of the much superior REC). For example, like Quarantine, this has an annoying female lead with a black cameraman buddy. The guys who did this also did Quarantine so it shouldn't be a surprise but you would think they would try to mix things up and not mimic previous work so obviously. Speaking of the black guy, he has one embarrassingly awful scene where he freaks out because he has claustrophobia or something. Whatever their intention was with that scene, the end result was comical. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this crap. My patience for shallow, banal horror films is pretty thin these days. This is especially true of found footage movies, a subgenre that seems to have offered all it has to offer by now. They aren't even trying to cover the obvious logic flaws anymore. A guy in this openly talks about committing a crime while people he just met film him. Who does that?!? Then he and his friends help these people commit the crime while still being filmed. Who does THAT?!? These aren't braindead stoner teenagers uploading videos of themselves committing vandalism to YouTube. None of this makes sense but it's the same tired logic failures that found footage movies need in order to work. Even the best of them have some of these things but the worst are full of them. I'll let you decide which this. You'll get your answer pretty quickly, I'll tell you that.The best thing about this is that a lot of it was actually filmed on location in the real catacombs. I guess Paris needed the money. I hope the bones that were manhandled by the cast were just props because, if not, that's just messed up and disrespectful. But since the heroine of this movie is an archaeologist with zero respect for historical places and artifacts, I wouldn't be surprised that the filmmakers share her attitude. So many clichés and predictable moments. When the guide randomly mentions his friend who got lost in the catacombs years before, you just know we'll see the guy eventually. Sure enough, he shows up and tells the others he knows a way out of the catacombs. And they just follow him. A completely creepy-looking guy who has been missing for years just shows up and tells you he knows a way out of the place he was supposedly lost in and you follow him. The characters in this movie are complete morons. Best part? When they find the entrance to Hell (yeah, I know) the guide says ""I'm...I'm not going in there."" Well finally someone has something smart to say. Of course he undoes that by just going right into the hole anyway. Morons. The plot is fueled by how stupid its characters are.If you're a fan of found footage movies, you'll probably be okay with just about every flaw this thing has. For everybody else this is not likely to be something you will enjoy. It looks and feels very similar to dozens of other found footage horror movies in recent years. Despite the different setting, it really does feel like more of the same. Avoid unless you're an avid horror fan who has to see every piece of crap that comes out.","As Above, So Below"
11,zardoz-13,A Crappy Colonoscopy Of A Horror Movie,1,8 September 2014,"""Quarantine"" director John Erick Dowdle conjures up plenty of spooky atmosphere but delivers only a paucity of thrills in his half-baked, found-footage chiller ""As Above, So Below"" about a group of cataphiles who plunge into the catacombs of Paris to exhume a Medieval relic known as the Philosopher's Stone. Initially, this low-budget but polished looking thriller must have appeared promising on paper: a plucky Laura Croft heroine, who knows six languages and holds a black belt in Capoeira, persuades a motley crew to crawl through the claustrophobic confines of the dead for a treasure worthy of an Indiana Jones escapade. Unfortunately, Dowdle and his co-scenarist brother Drew Dowdle don't stock their storyline with a sufficient number of screams. Once the novelty value of the catacombs as an eerie setting wears off, the brothers Dowdle resort to standard-issue shenanigans that generate no white-knuckled terror. Naturally, claustrophobia takes a toll on our heroes. Each ends up hallucinating about a tragic event from the past, and some find themselves in circumstances best described as surreal. Not only does one spelunker see a younger brother who he couldn't save from drowning, but also he finds a mysterious piano that reminds him of one from his youth that needed a tune-up. Simply said, ""As Above, So Below"" won't scare the catacombs out of you. Nevertheless, Dowdle does a good job of setting up suspense, but few of his alarming antics will send you screaming for the exits. Sure, you may feel a shiver scuttle up your spine, but you won't cut loose with blood-curdling screams unless you've never seen a horror movie. The blood and gore content isn't nearly as gruesome as it could have been for an R-rated chiller. The attractive twentysomething cast gives it their best shot, but the outcome seems fairly anti-climactic.Although she has multiple doctorates, Scarlett Marlowe (Perdita Weeks of ""Hamlet"") qualifies more as a tomb raider. She is the kind of girl who doesn't squeal at the sight of rats and spiders. In a suspenseful opening sequence, she enters Iran disguised as a native to obtain pictures of a giant stone bull that serves as a Rosetta Stone of sorts to interpret alchemic inscriptions prominently featured in the work of her late father. Basically, Scarlett is pursuing the same research that her father embarked on before he felt suicide was the best hope for his unhinged mind. He had devoted his entire life to the search for the fabled Philosopher's Stone. According to legend, this extraordinary stone could heal wounds as well as convert base metals into gold. Scarlett narrowly avoids death in Iran when the authorities blow up the tunnels where she is snapping pictures of those exotic inscriptions. Later, Scarlett convinces one of her former boyfriends, George (""Mad Men's"" Ben Feldman), who has just repaired an ancient cathedral church bell that hasn't tolled for 200 years, to accompany her on her elusive quest. Actually, Scarlett needs George because he knows a language that she doesn't. Moreover, George can get her into a museum during after-hours that houses an obscure artifact about medieval-era Parisian Nicolas Flamel who figures prominently in her research. What Scarlett learns from that museum piece that she desecrates without a qualm confirms our Tomb Raider mistress's suspicions. At first, an incredulous George refuses to follow Scarlett into the bowels of Paris in what amounts to a hair-raising colonoscopy. Since credibility is essential to her outlandish venture, Scarlett invites Benji (Edwin Hodge of ""Red Dawn"") to record her historic expedition. After she arrives in Paris, Scarlett enlists three quirky guides, a charismatic graffiti artist named Papillon (Francois Civil of ""Molière""), his girlfriend Souxie (newcomer Marion Lambert), and a professional climber Zed (Ali Marhyar of ""Zero Dark Thirty""), to not only get them into the forbidden catacombs but also keep them from getting lost. It should come as no surprise that Papillion succeeds splendidly in the first respect but fails miserably in the second. While Benji carries the camera, he has designed headbands equipped with micro-cams for the team to photograph everything from a variety of perspectives. This clever gimmick enables director John Erick Dowdle to show us various points-of-view from the participants so as to heighten the conflict. Obviously, if you suffer from claustrophobia, watching this marginally entertaining chiller may prove to be a genuine challenge. Furthermore, French lenser Léo Hinstin's epileptic, hand-held camera work may have you scrambling for Dramamine.""As Above, So Below"" is about as close as anybody will want to come to prowling the labyrinth of Parisian catacombs that contain the remains of some six million skeletons. As it turns out, Scarlett and her scavengers aren't the only intruders lurking in those passageways. Women wearing too much mascara and not enough apparel stand around and chant; a lanky dude long rumored dead reappears; a hooded character in a priest's robe skulks about, and petrified skulls protruding from walls transform into ghastly ghouls with an appetite for blood. None of them are scary enough to raise your hackles. Predictably, the Dowdle brothers stage several cave-ins and send our heroes into smelly drainage canals that connect the catacombs. All of this squirming about seems frightfully compelling as our heroes wriggle from one gritty crevice into another and struggle to decode hieroglyphics about alchemy. Inevitably, they have to contend with deadly booby traps that their predecessors concocted to discourage this kind of quest. Eventually, Scarlett and company stumble onto a doorway with the familiar Dantesque inscription ""Abandon hope all ye who enter here."" Anybody who winds up watching this lackluster chiller would do well to remember those sage words. Comparably, ""As Above, So Below"" isn't a tenth as terrifying as ""The Descent"" (2005), a thriller about a group of women trapped in a cave. Instead, ""As Above, So Below"" stinks as badly as the 2011 underwater cave thriller ""Sanctum.""","As Above, So Below"
12,george.schmidt,BLAIR WITCH meets THE LAST CRUSADE; Seriously stop with the shaky-cam genre!,5,3 September 2014,"AS ABOVE SO BELOW (2014) ** Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Edwin Hodge, Francois Civil, Marion Lambert, Ali Marhyar. Shaky-cam be damned horror film with familiar formula - band of morons go into a dangerous environment without letting anyone know where they are and only half of aforementioned morons know of the occult warnings presaged upon them : a pretty young explorer attempts to get in touch with her inner Indiana Jones by finding the gates of hell (literally) miles under the streets of Paris within the city's historical catacombs housing millions of dead. Not a good idea; ya think? While the filmmaker John Erick Dowdle has had experience with the enclosed claustrophobic set themed films before here it gets tedious and frankly hoping someone would strangle Weeks for getting them in this clusterfuck he and his partner in crime/bro Drew Dowdle. In spite of a handful of WTF moments blending THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and cribbing seriously from the aforementioned INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE the ending is something of a shocker (but not in the genre sense; just trust me on this and for that this study in stupidity gets one extra *","As Above, So Below"
13,neil-476,Unexceptional found footage horror,7,14 September 2014,"Scarlett is a kind of archaeological detective-y Indiana Jones-y person. Having found a statue with long-lost inscription clues, she mounts an expedition into hidden areas of the Parisian catacombs. But bad secrets may lurk there...The good thing about this film is that there is a tolerable sense of suspense, an excellent sense of atmosphere, and a genuine sense of claustrophobia.Less encouragingly, it is rather video game-y. There is little character development, characters seem to exist only as potential victims, and the narrative is ""people scrabbling about in tunnels."" And, worst of all main character Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) is a royal pain in the rear. She is one of those characters who wilfully pushes others into danger, risk and (in the case of this film) death. She really annoyed me.","As Above, So Below"
14,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Absolutely creepy and chilling effort,10,20 May 2015,"Hoping to uncover a mysterious artifact, a woman leads a team of explorers into the miles of catacombs beneath the streets of Paris only to find the forces that guard the treasure far more dangerous and deadly than anticipated.This was quite an enjoyable and truly chilling effort with a lot of impressive elements about it. One of the best ones is the fact that this one really goes all out with it's premise which is a pretty chilling tale in it's own right before even setting foot at the location. The concept of the historical alchemy and clues to the treasure found through all the different research in here makes for a solid enough exploration cause in here then manages to go even further inside with the revelations about the burial and the different puzzles that crop up throughout here that tend to let this one play off more like a tomb- raiding adventure rather than a horror film but the set-up is still quite enjoyable. Then once down in the catacombs themselves it's all kinds of fun with the locations and layouts of the area being just utterly chilling and perfectly suited to such an intense trip with this one really letting the series of cramped tunnels, bone-littered walkways, endless dark corridors and hidden passageways that continually yield a genuine claustrophobic experience that lets the supernatural manifestations really take hold. Those come in the form of truly chilling action scenes from the numerous descents and spelunking trips through the caverns, a spectacular trap against the treasure trove where the entire tunnel collapses in on them and the different encounters with their past fears that really help to sell this one so well. The confrontations with the father are quite dark and moody, the discovery of the piano is a marvelous sequence due to how it got so far below the surface and the phone-ringing also makes for quite a dark, ominous situation though the singular best sequence here is the discovery of the burning car in the tunnels which is just mind-blowingly chilling and really makes for quite a spectacular showcase scene with the fact that it's there in the first place and then the action that occurs following that is absolutely amazing. As well, the final race to get out is filled with even more great action as the crumbling statues come to life, the chase through the long corridors and the team retracing it's steps back to the surface is pretty harrowing and makes for a truly enjoyable time. Overall, the this one really only has one minute flaw in that there's such a long time in the beginning before they even get to the tunnels that it seems to be useless time to pad out the film which is exactly the amount of extra time it lasts here, but this is mostly ignored with all the other positives on display here.Rated R: Graphic Language and Violence.","As Above, So Below"
15,FlashCallahan,National Treasure meets Event Horizon......,7,4 September 2014,"A multi degree owning Indiana Jones wannabe is making a documentary about the elusive philosophers stone, and her venture to seek it out.Duping an old boyfriend in to helping her, finds the location of the stone buried deep in the catacombs of Paris, and hires a few Parisians, promising a fortune in treasure.When they enter the catacombs, they enter a world of fear, and their past finally catches up with them.Yes, another month, and another found footage film, though it didn't need to be found. But it's an intriguing one.After an impressive set up in Iran, the action goes straight to Paris, and it isn't long before the sinister feeling of dread comes into the fray, and its thanks to one woman in a nightclub.If it wasn't bad enough for a random stranger to stare at you abhorrently walking out of a club, it's blooming awful to have them do it in the packed club, from the outside.....Until we enter the catacombs, the film is a little bit of a filler, but once we get into the main bulk of the narrative, its a pretty tense movie.It's the directors best movie to date, and with such a minuscule budget, and small cast, he gets the job done well. But the film is not just about horror, it's about being helpless, not being able to turn back, and questioning your beliefs, and the sound effects are some of the most atmospheric in a long time.But the film, with its catacombs showing each character a past tragedy, does hark back to Event Horizon, and very time the philosophers stone is mentioned, I couldn't help but think of Daniel Radcliffe with an owl.But thankfully,the further they go down,the more bonkers the film get, and once they reach the supposed entrance to Hell, you just go with it, and enjoy the tension.If you don't like the found footage genre, it doesn't offer anything new, but if you like a good horror movie, especially a claustrophobic one, this will do.Would make a great double bill with The Borderlands, a British horror from earlier this year...","As Above, So Below"
16,Aaron1375,A very good found footage type film,8,9 October 2018,"I am not a huge fan of the whole wearing a camera type film and recording what the characters see film. This film was first popularized by the godawful Blair Witch Project. Sorry, I thought that film was total trash as it showed you nothing and people are telling me that you need to use my imagination...I counter, a movie is a visual medium and thus I should expect to see something other than three idiots cussing in the woods with them hearing something I couldn't and freaking out. This one was much better, but sadly did not make the money that one did, despite having a superior cast, a superior story and they actually showed you something! Add to those three things a super great setting and atmosphere! The story has a young woman who is searching for clues on the whereabouts of the philosopher's stone. She has it pinpointed in these catacombs of Paris, which actually exist and look creepy as heck! She is pointed to a man who knows the catacombs well and soon they are entering a section that is not open to the public. Within these catacombs things start to happen as they have to enter a section where it is said no one returns. Strange phones, pianos and a man who has been missing awhile make their appearance while the group progresses ever deeper into the catacombs trying to escape!The setting in this one is the real star. I honestly would love to explore a place like that; however, only if there was no danger, which is never going to be the case so I live vicariously through the actors in movies such as these. I kept enjoying their descent into this nightmarish world underneath Paris and kept wondering what they would find next!So I enjoyed this film a lot. I would have enjoyed it more, but the film did have a couple of flaws making it not as good as it could have been. I would have loved for them to be in the caves longer as I loved watching them in this area. I hated when the young woman had to backtrack because I had seen all the stuff in that area, I wanted more areas! I also wish I had seen a bit more as there were a couple of things I missed due to the shaky camera you get in a film such as this. I would have enjoyed the movie even more had it been your basic movie as that setting would be hard pressed to be topped!","As Above, So Below"
17,trashgang,wait until half the flick before it becomes rough,7,24 November 2014,"A lot is said about this flick. Coming from the man (John Erick Dowdle) behind the Quarantine remake franchise and directed Devil (2010). Been shot actually in the catacombs under Paris it do gives it a special feeling. But known his earlier flicks you know that this is going to be another shaky camera flick. So I started with mixed feelings. Do I want to see another so-called mockumentary. It was all original when the genre started but nowadays they are mostly a big yawn. Must say that this one do offer some good moments even as it is a slow starter after half the flick the creepy atmosphere do enters. And from that moment the effects come in some pure CGI like with the burning car and some on-camera. We do have the falling bodies like in REC (2007) which worked well and was nasty but of course by know we have seen it a lot, but I admit that it still works. I didn't had any problem with the CGI used for the car because it do gives you some creeps. BUt it's the ""Mol"" that will do offer some goosebumps. The way he do attack and the result is pure gore. And that's what makes this worth picking up. There's really some red stuff to see and well done. Naturally the story isn't that strong after all, seen it a thousand times with mummies and when they are entering 'hell' you know you're in for a treat. It isn't made for all horror buffs wandering this planet but if you like shaky camera's then you must pick this up. Some where between the jump moments of Paranormal Activity (2007) and the red stuff of REC (2007) or Quarantine (2008).Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5","As Above, So Below"
18,mm-39,I came in with low expectations!,7,31 August 2014,"I came in with low expectations! As Above, So Below is surprisingly good. The story is a mix between The Blair Witch project and Raiders of the lost Ark. The characters searching for a huge reward, become trapped into a maze aka Indian Jones style. Dealing with the supernatural, and figuring out the maze creates an interesting story which captivates the audience. The director creates a low budget, independent look with enough scares/twists to make the movie work. Grade B acting, but there is no bad acting with today's modern high standards. Just a few underacting gaps at the beginning. However, I loved the surprise ending! One understands the movie after the ending. 7 out of 10. Maybe they could make part two and have another Indiana Jones series.","As Above, So Below"
19,christopher-underwood,memorable and scary ride I won't be rushing back to in a hurry.,8,10 July 2019,"I was amazed just how impressive this was. I remember scurrying through part of the catacombs beneath Paris and also getting lost in some labyrinthine chambers beneath the old castle in Budapest and this film vividly brought back the potential horrors. A bit of Blair Witch here and a lot of mumbo jumbo but also much convincing dialogue and the action, all within these narrow passage ways, tunnels and pools, is always ongoing. The initial urge to get going and keep going is maintained throughout and if there is some inevitable repetition, this too becomes part of the worry. Music is spot on and all in all a most memorable and scary ride I won't be rushing back to in a hurry.","As Above, So Below"

But it just doesn't bring anything new to the found footage movies. It's still a alright popcorn flick and is worth a watch, when you have nothing else to do.

Some parts of the story is predictable and other parts I actually didn't see coming, although very few. Watching this flick was like watching one of those adventure movies like ""National Treasure"" with some horror elements. The dialogue between the characters has ""National Treasure"" written all over it. Well at least until they start going underground. It isn't really scary or gripping and some parts does get nauseating. The story is about couple of people looking for the Philosopher Stone which can grant immortality a infinite gold. Which is from what they know located underground Paris. I just didn't care about what was at stake of any of the characters. Which actually gets rid of the tension. It's a watchable movie that did at least got me paying attention from beginning to end, but nothing special. Not worth seeing it in theaters, but worth a rental. 6.6/10","As Above, So Below"
21,Hellmant,Has that really genuine claustrophobic feel to it!,7,4 September 2014,"'AS ABOVE, SO BELOW': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another horror flick from director John Erick Dowdle; who also helmed 'QUARANTINE', 'DEVIL' and 'THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES'. Dowdle wrote the film with his brother Drew (his usual writing partner) and it's presented in the 'found footage' storytelling format. The movie stars Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Edwin Hodge and Francois Civil. It tells the story of a group of explorers who journey into the deadly catacombs beneath Paris, in search of a legendary stone. The story and characters are a little weak but the suspense and creepy imagery is really well done (especially if you're high).Weeks plays Scarlett; a tough and young adventurer who's been in search of the Philosopher's Stone, for many years. The Philosopher's Stone is an alchemical substance believed to rejuvenate life. Scarlett believes it can be found in the miles of catacombs beneath Paris. She enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend George (Feldman), her friend (and cameraman) Benji (Hodge) and a team of other explorers to venture into the deadly maze with her. As strange occurrences begin happening they soon learn they may have entered Hell itself.The film does start out a little slow and I never found myself that interested in any of the characters or story (although Weeks looks stunningly beautiful the whole time). Still the movie has that really genuine claustrophobic feel to it, at times, and it's almost always creepy (at least in the second half of the film). Dowdle is definitely a good director, for this type of material, and the movie definitely delivers what audiences, of these types of movies, are paying for (especially if you're stoned when you see it)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/aqjev8q5voo","As Above, So Below"

Disappointing ending tho","As Above, So Below"
23,bowmanblue,Seen it all before,5,29 March 2015,"Two words: 'Found' and 'Footage.' That's basically all you need to know. If you're in any way into your 'modern horror' films, you'll already know that 'found footage' movies are basically entirely filmed from the perspective of the cameraman (using some loose pretext of 'needing' to film absolutely everything that everyone does). If you didn't already know that then you're probably quite lucky.The reason Hollywood seems to be so obsessed with way of filming horror is because it's cheap. If you're constantly running away from a monster (for example) then the camera shakes and you don't need that much in the way of special effects.'As Above, So Below' is just another in a long line of found footage movies. Yes, it's got slightly more of a budget than your average B-movie and the acting is okay. Basically, some girl and her cameraman decide to look for treasure in the tunnels under Paris. They get some bland tour guides to show them the way and then end up lost down there. Naturally, there are things down there which are going to chase them and generally mess with their minds. So, expect every horror (and found footage) cliché going. Ever since 'The Blair Witch Project' it's been common for the protagonist to talk directly into camera at close distance. As Above, So Below does this. Just like it does all the chasing through the darkness with shaky camera-work. The first half is basically getting to know the characters. Not that there's much to know about them. They're just the cannon fodder for when the film gets going. The chases come in the second act, but, if you've seen any other found footage film, you'll know what's coming.You won't care about the characters. You probably won't care much about their plight. There are a couple of moments when you'll jump and there's a bit of gore near the end, but there's nothing here to really write home about. It's not a bad film, but there's just so little new here that it doesn't make it worth watching. If you've never seen a 'found footage' film before, you may think it's original and get something out of it. But, for us hardened horror buffs, move along...","As Above, So Below"
24,cosmo_tiger,A very neat idea that was ruined by the jump-scares that never seemed to fit.,7,1 December 2014,"""As above, so below as I believe the world to be, so it is."" Scarlett (Weeks) is searching for the philosopher's stone and thinks she has finally found the resting place of it. She puts together a crew and heads to the catacombs beneath the streets of Paris. What they end up finding is something no one is prepared for. This is a difficult movie to review. The idea of a type of horror Indiana Jones/National Treasure is great. This starts off very strong and the fact that they actually filmed in the catacombs beneath Paris gave this ""found footage"" more of a reality based feel. The real downfall and problem with the movie is the horror aspect. The horror of the movie is really nothing more than jump scare after jump scare. Normally that isn't a terrible thing but in this movie it just doesn't make sense. You watch the interesting aspect of the explorers trying to figure out the symbols they find and then from out of nowhere someone jumps at the camera, then the exploring continues. The horror would have been better if it was done more suspenseful like The Cave rather than having it feel like an afterthought. Overall, a very neat idea that was ruined by the jump- scares that never seemed to fit. I give this a B.","As Above, So Below"

28,eddie_baggins,The location is the star in this enjoyable horror/thriller,6,18 May 2015,"While it wants you to think it's an out and out horror, John Erick Dowdle's found footage film As Above, So Below works far better as a thriller than a film that scares and while everything here is silly with a capital S, going into this film with the right mindset will allow you to have a whole lot of fun with a film that acts as some form of horrific Tomb Raider like adventure.The main star of As Above, So Below is the Parisian catacombs (where the film was shot) that scour underneath the city of love, endless mazes underlying a bustling city acting as the perfect creation for ominous dread, claustrophobic crawlspaces and a sense of exploration that must surely dwell within us all. Dowdle perfectly captures the time spent underground and it brings back memories of Neill Marshall's terrific cavern set The Descent in the use of such un-explored spaces, we like the characters are unsure of just what we may find in what is essentially a quite simplistic narrative.The story that set's up this tale is essentially taken from such elements relating to Dante etc. and the well-known story of Nicholas Flamel and the Philosopher's Stone with dogged explorer Scarlett (played well by Weeks) trying to discover what her daddy couldn't do. While Scarlett's journey is what's essentially the hook here there's not really much point in trying to say her arc is what drives the story as things deep below quickly escalate into a state that requires much poetic licence and forgiving by the audience in what is a flaw filled and at times amateurish collection of events. In saying this though when the film clicks it clicks well and the film has a genuine sense of foreboding and a narrative that will keep you guessing even though we pretty much know who may or may not meet a grisly end in what becomes a – who's going to die next? Type of play out.As Above, So Below is a neat little horror/thriller that often excels in being a great example of found footage exploration bringing in a sense of audience participation to the ride that these characters are taking. While it's dialogue may at time falter and scenarios drop flat with the slightest bit of examination, there is a fine adventure taking place here that has a few well played acting turns, a nice array of surprises and a fine authentic production value that helps create one of 2014's more enjoyable surprises in a genre that is scarily thin on such things.3 conveniently on hand cleaning products out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","As Above, So Below"
29,filipemanuelneto,A good idea that ended up ruined.,4,5 February 2017,"This low-budget film starts from a promising premise: the legendary quest for the Philosopher's Stone, allegedly discovered by a medieval alchemist, Nicholas Flamel. However, the whole story is based on a script so ambitious that it ends up being its own enemy. One of it most obvious mistakes is to arbitrarily mix historical elements, such as the unlikely link between a medieval pseudo-scientist (who, at most, would know some Latin) and a Persian stone tablet in Aramaic, an absolutely unknown language in medieval Europe. The use of Paris catacombs as a movie location was an excellent move, adding value and interest to the film but, despite the gloomy atmosphere, it failed to create tension. The scares repeat themselves, successfully, but nothing more. There is no real fear or suspense. The use of an old kabbalistic axiom (as above so below) is determinant for the plot and the end of the film, always having in mind the words and their meaning (difficult to understand for those who are not fans of the occult). Perdita Weeks is the lead actress and does a fairly reasonable job, but the rest of the cast does not help. Cinematography is bad, but I think it was purposeful because it's supposed to be a found-footage or something based on unedited recordings.","As Above, So Below"

31,matthewssilverhammer,Scary? Yes. Good? No.,4,6 September 2014,"How do you critique a film when its main purpose succeeds but, in every other way, it fails? As a force of visceral terror, AA,SB is spine-chilling fun; as a piece of storytelling, it's an eye-rolling drag. It's overly convoluted in its lore and overly simple in its characterization. There are too many characters, and every back story is senseless at best and annoying at worst. Like a well-executed haunted house, at times it's truly creepybut haunted houses don't have to have a point. Stories do. This one doesn't. AA,SB follows a tenacious Indiana-Jones-esque girl with daddy issues, leading a search for the philosopher's stone in the catacombs under Paris, France. Think Goonies if they grew up, lost their personality and got in over their heads. It's full of the basic horror foreshadowing (ominous signs, uncouth jokes) and telling dialogue, making it hard to be surprised or really care when the deaths begin to pile up. Most frustrating is that AA,SB is yet another movie hurt by the gimmick of found footage. I get that they wanted to make it seem more ""real"" to enhance the scares, but a simple hand-held camera would've done the trick. As is, it's incomprehensibly shaky, unintentionally goofy, and lazily edited (in the club scene, notice how the music never stops when the shots cut). Again, this movie IS scary, especially once you push past the surprisingly long build up to the catacombs. There's some great cultish imagery and plenty of jumps to effectively make you avert your gaze. Outside of these too few classic horror moments, pervasive dumbness reigns supreme.","As Above, So Below"

It's as if the Paranormal Activity people are trying to branch out and try something different. They use the hand held cameras, or even sometimes, a camera is strapped to their heads to make it look like it's found video. The scares-if you can call them that-are usually pretty lame; mostly it's people or things showing up where they should not be. Perdita plays an archaeologist that is carrying on with her father's work of finding an artifact called the Philosopher's Stone. It seems he died before finishing his work. Ben is a language expert that tags along to help interpret the mysterious writings on the walls and Edwin is the camera man that films everything. The trail leads to Paris, specifically, underneath Paris and into the catacombs where dead people are buried. Francois is a local that knows the catacombs and becomes their guide. They come across a warning on a wall that says, 'Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here' and someone says, 'We must keep going'. Someone later on dies and someone else says, 'We must keep going'. Someone sees a burning car in the catacombs that sucks one of them into it and someone else says, Yep, you guessed it, 'We must keep on going'. It just wasn't very good.

As is only right and proper in situations like this, there is nothing but grisly trouble for these entrepreneurs. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why this film fails for me. I'm generally a fan of the found footage genre and feel that, if used skilfully, it is still a terrific, intimate way of telling a story. But, while the locations are excellent and the cast are capable (especially Weeks, who avoids allowing her character to becoming the headstrong know-all, as written), there's nothing particularly scary, or unfamiliar here.Soon after the ensemble enter the catacombs, any individuality they initially had evaporates and they all become a mass of screaming, bloody noise blurrily picked out by the ever-shaking camera. After a while of this, it is all too easy to lose track of who is who and just what is going on. The last thing this jumble manages to be is frightening.","As Above, So Below"

And the film makes nice use of historical/legendary elements. Unfortunately the film comes completely unglued about half way through. The script leans heavily into the irrationality of magick and horror. I guess the unpredictability was meant to be scary but it just bored me.The found footage conceit does not really makes sense here.

It also doesn't really help that the actors are all fairly crappy and *somehow* manage to mess up naturalistic tone the shooting style is going for.,"As Above, So Below"
38,jimbo-53-186511,Random and rather nonsensical,3,30 July 2015,"Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) is continuing her father's legacy and discovers a rose key in Iran which she believes will help her to discover Nicholas Flamel's philosophers stone. However, in order to find this stone she must venture deep into The Catacombs in Paris. Complete with a translator, a tour guide (amongst others), Scarlett heads off into the Catacombs but this journey turns out to be far more perilous than Scarlett and the others could possibly imagine.The mumbo-jumbo muddled set up that we see here made for a bit of a dull 30 minutes - I struggled to buy into the story and was basically just waiting for the moment where the gang enter The Catacombs. The good news is that things do pick up slightly after the first 30 minutes, but only in the sense that it goes from dull to clichéd and predictable (although personally I'll always prefer a clichéd and predictable film to a dull one). The writers here really don't hold back and throw every horror and 'found footage' cliché at us - whether it be bodies coming out of nowhere, heads and hands popping up from everywhere. This film lacks any real imagination and when watching it I found myself just going through the motions and pretty much predicting what was going to happen from scene to scene. These sort of films are always good for a couple of cheap scares, but they are also pretty forgettable and never have much re-watch value.Whilst watching this film I also noticed a couple of rather annoying flaws; I struggled understanding why the filmmakers decided to include a piano and a car collapsing from the streets above into The Catacombs. Not only was it completely implausible, but it was also totally pointless. The fact that it was actually filmed in The Catacombs meant it was impossible to buy into this 'fictional' occurrence. It was a stupid and unnecessary addition to the story. The narrative also brings problems with the guy who has been in The Catacombs for 2 years; such as how he'd survived down there for 2 years without food or water, he then ends up 'randomly' possessed - by who and why? This is never explained. Perhaps he'd been possessed for quite a while and the demons (or whatever they were) chose the most opportune moment for him to attack the group - this would at least explain how he'd survived down there for so long. I'm all for films leaving things for the audience to work out, but this seemed to be randomly inserted into the story for no real reason (other than to give the audience another cheap scare).As with most found footage films the camera work is nauseating and distracting (although it does seem far worse here). The actors are annoying and spend most of their time yelling at each other and squabbling - both the camera work and the actors did become irritating at times. In fact, the camera work was so bad at times that it became difficult to see some of the cheap scare tricks that had been employed (although I doubt I was missing much).This isn't an out and out terrible film and certainly isn't the worst found footage film I've seen - that dubious honour very much belongs to Willow Creek. Perdita Weeks is more than competent in the lead role and the film does provide some cheap scares and once the gang are inside the Catacombs it's never really boring. However, for me the clichéd scare tactics, the uninteresting story and the shoddy camera work don't make for a particularly good viewing experience.","As Above, So Below"
39,drownnnsoda,Raiders of the Philosopher's Stone,6,29 August 2014,"""As Above, So Below"" centers on two archaeologists and a group of urban spelunkers who break into the catacombs below Paris. However, unlike most naive tourists, they have quite the reason: they are in search of an arcane philosopher's stone that purportedly holds the powers of eternal life. Unfortunately, the group becomes trapped in a labyrinth of caves that lead them deeper and deeper into the earth... and closer and closer toward the gates of hell.Directed and co-written by John Erick Dowdle, who was behind ""Devil"" and the apocryphally unreleased ""Poughkeepsie Tapes,"" ""As Above, So Below"" is, at its roots, an action-packed adventure flick melded with the makings of found-footage horror, and, although at times ridiculous, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wildly entertaining. The central crux of the plot hinges on a mystical stone whose existence has been buried (literally and metaphorically) by history, and the protagonist, Scarlett (Perdita Weeks), the daughter of an archaeologist and alchemy student, makes it her life goal to finish her deceased father's work and find it. While this is admittedly fantastical and no doubt requires a slight stretching of the imagination, the historical and mythological aspects of the film still manage to be compelling none the less.That said, the real hook of the film lies in its setting: les Catacombes de Paris. To date, I only know of one other film that takes place in the ghoulish setting— the slightly underwhelming ""Catacombs"" (2007). While both films are very different in plot, they both share the same pull due to their unusually extraordinary setting. ""As Above, So Below"" also admittedly borrows elements from Neil Marshall's ""The Descent,"" but those who call this film a ""found footage rip-off"" are way off base. Both films take place underground, yes, and ""As Above, So Below"" does appear to borrow a couple of sequential elements from Marshall's film, but they are complete tonal opposites. There are plenty of wild and fun elements in this film, including secret passages, trapdoors, tunnels circling in on themselves, and ringing telephones 500 feet under the earth, but all of it is done in good taste and manages to evoke some solid scares and an oppressive atmosphere. The hand-held camera-work accentuates the explorers' sense of disorientation, and one gets the increasing sense of desperation as they venture deeper and deeper into the belly of the beast.The most obvious issue with the film is that it suffers from a half-baked subplot surrounding the individuals' reliving/re-facing demons of their past, which appears to have been an overarching, perhaps even singular theme, but it fails to really ever take hold, crumbling under the film's dynamic subterranean locale; quite literally under the weight of the earth. I felt like this entire subplot(?) could have been completely stripped from the script, and we still would have had a solid, effective film here. I don't want to say that it juggles too many themes as a result, because it really doesn't, but the incorporation of this with the mythology of the film comes off as a little bit harebrained. There is already enough Indiana Jones whimsy to be had here as it is, so these sequences of characters facing past demons are ultimately ineffective among the rest of the film's funhouse attractions.Even still, I found this to be a wildly entertaining thriller and a good, claustrophobic two hours at the cinema. It is not a great film, but it is a well made film, and is especially a delight for anyone who is as fascinated by the Paris catacombs as I am, or just subterranean depths in general. It's claustrophobic, fast-paced, and at times genuinely spooky; at other times, it's absolutely silly and edges into Indiana Jones territory, but at the end of the day, I thought this was a solid concoction of fantasy, adventure-thriller, and supernatural horror elements. Take it for what it is, and it's rightfully enjoyable. 6/10.","As Above, So Below"

42,TdSmth5,"A remarkable POV movie, but still a POV movie",7,21 December 2014,"Some obnoxious chick with an obnoxious British accent is filming herself as she travels to Iran. She tells us she wants to explore some caves that are about to be blown up. Why someone would blow up caves, who knows. A man receives her and guides her to the caves. This is of course just as authorities are closing things down for the demolition. She finds some wall with inscriptions, breaks it and discovers a room with an animal figure that has more inscriptions on it. The Iranian guy is long gone and now the explosions start and unfortunately the chick makes it back just in time.Next she's in Paris and some guy is filming her. She wants to document her research. We learn that she super smart and gifted. I guess that's why she had to have a British accent. In movies smart people have to have a British accent, just so that the audience never dares think there might be smart Americans. Her father was another researcher, the foremost expert on alchemy and he was looking for the philosopher's stone, which converts base metals to gold and gives eternal life.She tracks down a guy she knows who can translate the inscriptions she found on the figure. He's reluctant but agrees. Next they go to see the tombstone of Nicolas Flamel, a medieval alchemist who's thought to have discovered the stone. There they interpret some more mysterious inscriptions and conclude that they have to visit the crypt/cave system underneath Paris. They find a French team of ""experts"", some bunch of kids and make it down the crypts and go through secret paths. They find a bunch of mysteries--a supposedly vanished guy, a room with the well-preserved corpse of a templar knight, a treasure room, but then things get complicated. They are warned that they are about to enter hell. They battle traps, riddles, crumbling ceilings, thousands of bones, water, injuries, and their past.As you can tell from his summary, As Above So Below is the most involved, complex, and rich POV movie made so far. So I appreciate the effort. This movie apparently was filmed in Parisian crypts and has a budget. So we're not confined with a bunch of morons in a house or a room or some such nonsense. And for the most part these people do more than just bicker and scream at each other. The esoteric aspect imparts a depth that no other POV movie can come close. The writers actually did research and thought about things before writing their script. And for once we get sharp images and no green nightvision! See, it is possible to make a good-looking POV movie.Unfortunately, they botched things with the teen cast and the annoying lead. Solutions are found way too quickly. It would have been cooler had these people actually have to think about the riddles. But for some reason all the rich concepts and ideas aren't used to their full potential, it's more of an excuse to have people running around caves back and forth. That said this movie manages to keep your interest, despite all the running around. Because of the teen rushed pace one of the more interesting ideas--of the story and space folding upon itself doesn't come across as striking. As often happens with these movies, logic is the first victim of the pace and format. For once, the POV format ends up working against the story. The Dowdles clearly are smart and original guys. They could achieve so much more if they ditched the dumb POV format and the teen casts and focused on making feature films for a smart adult audience.","As Above, So Below"
43,I_Ailurophile,Much more than I usually expect of found footage horror,8,10 October 2021,"I began watching 'As above, so below' without any foreknowledge, and immediately loved the premise. The concept bears the same air of historical mystery that served as the foundation for blockbuster thrillers like 'National Treasure' and 'The Da Vinci Code,' and weaving that fancy into a horror flick is enticing. I'm broadly ambivalent about found footage films, but in the very least it definitely fits with the idea at hand - so here we are.Strange occurrences begin to manifest as the group explore the underground, and they largely take a different form than I had anticipated - concretely bizarre, and unsettling. Factor in the great unease that inherently comes with the depth, complexity, and tight spaces of the tunnels, and the stage is set for an emphatically harrowing run to the climax. I rather wish that there were simply more to the film, and that it didn't take as long as it does to reach the second act. This would thereby allow for still more nastiness in the latter half - though to be sure, as it is what we get is plentifully horrific.I love the sound design in 'As above, so below'; unnerving noises contribute much to the disturbing course of events. Likewise, Keefus Ciancia's score is decisively built on very abnormal, unnatural ambient soundscapes, further the atmosphere of dread. To that same end, those smaller aspects of movies that sometimes escape attention are pretty swell: makeup, costume design, lighting. Where special effects are employed, they realize elements that are duly disquieting. While the screenplay doesn't require much of the cast beyond quite typical horror characterizations, everyone involved performs well to embody their roles and bring the story to life.It's also worth noting that the movie actually upended the notions I held of how it would all resolve. Years of horror movies, and found footage flicks especially, have trained us to anticipate certain likely outcomes for survivors at the conclusion of their trials and tribulations. This one took a different approach, and it's honestly gratifying to see.I began watching with mixed expectations, and I'm pleased with the end result. If sometimes a little exaggerated, there's a significant amount of content packed in here that's distinctly chilling, and the narrative is solid. The concept works well with the niche genre the film inhabits, and what blood and gore we see is suitably visceral. I don't think it will be heralded as an essential classic in the time to come, but particularly among other pictures of this nature, I think this one stands out, and in general 'As above, so below' is a fine horror flick worth watching if you have the chance.","As Above, So Below"
44,aidanratesmovies,It's 'The Descent' as a found footage film- but not hardly as interesting,5,8 May 2021,"It's a rather original film and a weirdly different take on the found footage horror genre- but As Above, So Below can hardly find it's footing to carry along a decent film. I have many problems with this film. First off, I largely don't feel the found footage aesthetic was necessary. I get what it's trying to do, but I feel that if they had to use it, they could have integrated it in with decent camera shots, instead of being just another cliche filmed footage flick. The film goes a bit all over the place tone-wise, its first act feeling like a dreadful bore, its second act feeling quite predictable although mildly interesting, and its third act decent but messy. There is hardly anything redeemable about the first act of the film, it's a bland exposition that paints the exact by the numbers kind of picture you would expect from a film like this. The second act we finally get to see the action start, but it feels a bit too familiar to be that much fun, and the parts it focuses on hardly seem fitting for the tone it's trying to pull off. Lastly, I enjoyed watching the last third of the movie, it was suspenseful and had some fun creepy imagery, but didn't make a whole lot of sense plot wise. In the end, As Above, So Below is a mediocre found footage film that tries a lot of new things, but also relies heavily on the films that got it made in the first place.My Rating: 5.3/10.","As Above, So Below"
45,s3276169,A badly mixed cocktail,2,4 January 2015,"As Above So Below offers us Paris's underground of the dead, hell and a team of Indiana Jones style explorers seeking an artifact. Its an interesting cocktail that needs to be handled with care. The fact that it is not is reason this film fails to impress.The adventurers claustrophobic descent through the physical tunnels inhabiting Paris's city of the dead leads to an artifact, which in turn and for no clearly explained reason leads to the entrance of hell. A smooth segue into hell itself is lost as the physical elements which dominate this film suddenly and inexplicably give way to a psychological, not terribly frightening rendering of hell. Its a headache inducing, confused concoction, that leaves you feeling intoxicated and not in a good way. Best left on the shelf. Two out of ten from me.","As Above, So Below"
46,rgkarim,"Originally Weird Story, with unstable camera",6,30 August 2014,"This Labor Day weekend is looking a little slow in my area as only two, yes two movies are premiering this weekend. Earlier I reviewed the latest spy novel, but tonight I saw the latest horror movie entitled As Above So Below. After seeing the trailers quite a few times, I was hesitant as to what this tale would bring, with the only certainty being the potential for a shaky camera. However, the glimpses we've seen in the trailers promoted a tail that defied the typical wave of terror. Was I impressed? Please read on to find out. As you have seen on the commercials by now, this movie takes place in the Catacombs of France, the world's largest morgue. Yet why anyone would want to clamber into the hidden chambers of the hopeless area is beyond me. The Dowdle brothers help put a logical, albeit stretched, plot of searching for a long lost treasure that even I had forgotten was myth. In an impressive display of screenplay writing, this movie spends the first half hour setting up the adventure in a manner similar to the National Treasure franchise. Amidst the searching of hidden tunnels and marred exhibits we get some brief background information on our team of explorers. The background is certainly not the most developed, but it isn't half bad and attempts to set up for the latter part of the film. One of the downsides of this opening, a bit long winded at points, and emotionally flat when they reveal some of the darker shadows of the past. Once in the caves though, the tale takes a twist for the weird as the National Treasure elements continue take a firmer hold, and unfortunately go down a confusing path. The more explaining the characters did, the more I got lost. Whatever was chasing them through the catacombs still remained a mystery, as whatever beast lurked in the hallowed tunnels took the form of various things, many of which were random and didn't necessarily fit into any part of the story. Within the caves we get more revelations, but the directors forego any drawn out emotion with the sometimes-subtle revelations. Even their logic for escaping is rather ambiguous, tying mythological theology with numerous civilization references that makes for a difficult time at hand. Eventually most of the story gets explained, but the writers hastily wrapped up some of their exuberant stories. Despite the flaws though, the plot is definitely more original than most of the horror movies we've seen, deviating from the typical ghost or serial murderer and forging some new ground. They just needed to reign in some things and do a little more explaining on the horror at hand. Speaking of horror, As Above So Below seems to have traded the details for attempts to try to scare and freak you out. The movie has some decent points where things jump out of you, though most of them are predictable or have been ruined by the trailer. Classic techniques such as the sudden silence, the focus on a dark corner, or the justly timed comment are obvious foreshadows for the scares at hand. Instead the real terror comes from the setting itself, with the Catacombs providing the gaping, soulless maw where anything can lurk. My imagination was able to provide most of the chills, painting horrible creatures and spirits from the brief glimpses and sounds. Such simple techniques really provide the best source of fear, and when combined with the dirty, festering bowels of the morgue really gave me chills. Of course the claustrophobic shots of the adventurers moving through the tight knit tunnels, can have you feeling uncomfortable as well. Thus I warn those with the fear of close spaces to avoid this movie. Despite the chills it provides though, the odd things they see diminish a lot of the fear factor. There is no cohesiveness to the things in the catacombs, the weird direction they took leading to random obstacles appearing in no discernible order. Sure they still were creepy, but at times I laughed at the ridiculous things they came up with, especially when some of them were punched in the face with such ease. Yeah you heard me, punched in the face. Somehow, what was lurking in the tunnels was unable to touch some of the people, again ambiguously explained by the ending. However, the worst thing that takes away from the movie is the camera work. Found footage films still have a tendency to bring unstable, shaky scenes, where one is exposed to a lot of the camera darting around to mimic the panicked state of the crew. While I do appreciate their attempts to get us into the scene, I prefer a movie that has a steady focus and only goes into colossal shaking at points. Sure the tremors prevented us from getting a clear look at the denizens of the dark, but still there is a point where it becomes too much. My recommendation though is, if you get sick from movies in first person perspective then avoid this movie at all costs. As Above So Below is a twist on the horror movie genre, which I can greatly appreciate in terms of trying to be original. However, the convoluted plot and shallow character stories make this attempt at uniqueness more complicated than is worth the effort. The shaky camera work also takes away a lot from the movie, and unfortunately for the movie, there isn't much to offset it. Is this worth a trip to the theater? Not really, and I strongly encourage watching this film in the comforts of your home when the time comes. My scores for this movie are: Horror/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 4.5","As Above, So Below"
47,richard-1787,"Not for the claustrophobic, or anyone else I can think of",1,30 August 2014,"For almost an hour and a half, the characters in this movie wander through an endless series of very narrow, poorly lit tunnels. Things keep going wrong. Every now and then, the roof of the tunnel threatens to collapse, or they have to swim under water without knowing if they will be able to surface again, or ... Threats created to play on the audience's phobias. The characters are constantly screaming, running and so out of breath, etc.Finally, at the very end, the three who survive emerge from a tunnel and you see the traditional romantic view of Notre Dame cathedral in the background. They are along the Seine River, in Paris, more or less where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron danced in An American in Paris. The young woman survivor hugs one of the two young male survivors. The other one walks away.There is no real plot to this movie. It's just an hour and a half of trying to frighten the audience with the same things - fear of being trapped underground, fear of drowning, etc. Incredibly repetitive. No interesting special effects, nothing that could hold anyone's interest. It's almost all shot in the dark, so you don't see much.If you want to be frightened for 90 minutes with the same threats over and over and are willing to spend money for that, maybe you'll get your money's worth out of this.If you're expecting it to have anything to do with Paris, or the catacombs under Paris, as I did, you'll be sadly disappointed, so don't bother with it.It is truly the worst movie I have ever sat through in a theater.","As Above, So Below"
48,burlesonjesse5,"VIEWS ON FILM review of As Above, So Below",7,8 January 2015,"In taking on the role as lead actress via 2014's As Above, So Below, Perdita Weeks proves to be quite the siren. A sort of Welsh Katherine Heigl if you will, she is gorgeous, appealing, and effortlessly witty (just like the rest of the film's young cast members). She leads a group of treasure hunters, tour guides (sort of posing as foot soldiers), and a hesitant translator into the eerie Catacombs of Paris, France.That's the blueprint for this highly unoriginal horror film that tirelessly sledgehammers the aspects of the hand held, found footage genre. But to my dismay, it became moderately effective by plowing its way through a homage of everything from sci-fi drama to adventure comedy (I'm not kidding). After taking in a viewing, I even found a new tag line for its upside down poster: ""As a movie, it sometimes glows."" Has a nice ring to it don't you think?Anyway, containing no background music (but still dispensing a sense of doom and gloom throughout) and directed by Minnesota native John Erick Dowdle (he helmed the similar themed Quarantine back in 2008), this moderate box office misfire (at least in the U.S.) hones in on young, alchemy scholar Scarlett Marlowe (Weeks). Her father committed suicide long ago and now she's relentless on continuing his work by trying to find a philosopher's stone (one that can grant eternal life and turn base metals into gold and silver). This stone according to local legend, is located beneath caves in Paris called the Catacombs. So therein lies a mission. Scarlett pulls together a group consisting of a cameramen, a cocky tour guide (Papillon played by Francois Civil), the tour guide's best friend in Zed (played by Ali Marhyar, who does a goofy Robert De Niro impersonation), the tour guide's girlfriend (Souxie played by Marion Lambert), and a translator (Ben Feldman as George). From that moment on, danger and darkness ensue. You know by the time they enter those caves, bad things are bound to happen. By the way, it's sort of funny that the Weeks character needed a translator to figure out what was written on ancient rocks 1000 feet beneath the Earth's surface. She's educated, has a bunch of degrees, and speaks several languages (even ones that aren't used anymore). This is a minor oversight and shouldn't keep you from enjoying what's on screen.Now for the most part, this mild jolt fest is a cavalcade of different mystery/horror thrillers. If a human being is considered a mutt (someone of many different racial descents) then As Above, So Below is the movie equivalent of said mutt. It copies off of everything from The Blair Witch Project (characters in ""As Above"" get lost in Catacombs like the characters in ""Witch"" get lost in the woods) to The Shining (the hotel in The Shining has haunting, hallucinatory images just like the caves in ""As Above"" which channel a similar vibe) to The Goonies (both flicks have the whole treasure hunting shtick going on) to Paranormal Activity (they both contain around-the-corner scares where the camera cuts this way and then that way plus plenty of video documentation) to The Descent (The Descent has zombies where as ""As Above"" has ghosts, but both exercises deal in the aspect of claustrophobia) to Flatliners (both films deal with a human's darkest fears, a past that continues to haunt them, and demons on the other side that know their business).And along with plenty of random imitations, As Above, So Below even has the token side character (Benji portrayed by Edwin Hodge) who's role is slapdash playing the falling-behind-and-getting-hurt cameraman. Its also got the token heroine who can't leave well enough alone but is spared at the end because she's well, the main protagonist. And finally, there's everyone saying stuff like the familiar, ""we gotta keep moving"" or ""you're crazy, you can't go in there"" or my personal favorite, ""oh my God"". Like I said, this is probably not the freshest horror vehicle out there. But it plods along nicely and is done with just the right amount of solid, technical skill. Oh and if you don't suffer from motion sickness (I'm basing this on the abundance of jittery camera-work), then ""As Above"" should provide you with one heck of a ride.But being the snobbish critic I am, I kinda wish this thing wasn't found footage fodder. I mean this is the one of those films that didn't really need the hand held camera treatment. There's no clear consistency of what is being documented nor who the footage is being documented for (except for maybe Scarlett's own, personal instrumentation which seems trivial). And for the record, this exercise reminded me of Into the Storm which came out earlier this summer. Watching both films made me ponder what was actually being videotaped and what was you know, movie movie. What a headache (there also happened to be cameras on people's heads, really?).As for the film's rollicking third act and its ending, well it's exciting, heart-pumping stuff even though it leaves you confused by the time the final credits come up. I won't give anything away only to give you one hint: Look again towards the film's poster (as mentioned earlier). This might give you a clue.In conclusion, of all things I thought the script for ""As Above"" had an intelligence to it and a certain je ne sais quoi. The characters didn't talk rubbish and fill my head with your typical, supernatural mumbo jumbo. It's currently at a Redbox kiosk so you might as well check it out. Result: A harmless 3 stars.","As Above, So Below"
49,Kamurai25,"""Going Down, Down, Down""",8,3 October 2020,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.It is found footage in the catacombs of France so in addition to shaky cam and odd angles, it does feel really claustrophobic at points. If you were okay with ""The Descent"", then you're likely fine.This is based off of a real thing that people do, exploring existing structures, some lost through history, others unused, and even more that are assumed inaccessible from the the layman.Personally, instead of making these places a crime, people should be able to add infrastructure as needed, but it is the primer for the events of the actual movie. Chased down into the catacombs, they basically just keep going towards insanity.There are so many good points in the psychological horror of it all, and the great unknown of the caves plus random acts of terror makes a great formula for the events of this movie.Probably the best ""philosopher's stone"" story I've ever seen.","As Above, So Below"
50,lemon_magic,"Pretty fair ""Found Footage"" Horror/Suspense film with obvious (but forgiveable) flaws",7,7 June 2018,"All right, I just have have to get this out of the way up front: Professional archaeologist and her experienced catacomb-spelunking expedition companions go on an exploratory trip into the unknown depths of the Paris catacombs...and they don't bring GLOVES ??? With that out of the way, my other complaint is that most of the illusions/hallucinations/traps that came to life to bedevil our heroes and heroines were pretty flat and unconvincing. Maybe there needed to be a bit more backstory for the characters in the party, or maybe the art direction and design (which probably looked pretty good on the storyboards) needed a little more polish and revision. Whatever, with very few exceptions, the revenants and wraiths just weren't scary in and of themselves. I sort of had to persuade myself that the characters would find them convincing.And this isn't really a complaint, but the movie just had more ideas and subplots than it knew what to do with, leaving a lot of the suggestions and subplots unresolved or unanswered. It's seems possible that a lot of material got left on the cutting room floor as the editors tried to keep the movie from being over long and too hard to watch. That sure beats the alternative of thin plots being stretched out too far or editors having to pad the film with extraneous junk, but it's still a problem. Now, in its favor: the movie got a lot of things right. Unlike most similarly themed movies, the screenplay incorporated many of the classic Grail, Inferno, and alchemical mythic tropes, which lent it a lot of oomph for people who are up on those things (so it's as much suspense as it is horror). Unlike ""Tomb Raider"", the protagonists are not larger than life icons whose safety and survival are guaranteed (which ramps up the tension and uncertainty). The sense of claustrophobia, creepiness, and isolation as the expedition ventures further and further down the rabbit hole with no way back, is very well done. The actors are attractive, interesting, and likable (except maybe for the character of ""Zed"", who doesn't seem to have much purpose other than to fill out the party and doesn't have a lot to say or do that any other character could have done.) So: worth watching if you enjoy this sort of thing. Different enough (with its mythical themes and ideas) from the typical monster or revenant movie to feel fairly fresh. Fairly well acted, with a lot of energy at times, and a good sense of suspense for most of the movie. I liked it enough to purchase a copy of it after I rented it.","As Above, So Below"
51,vengeance20,Not Bad,7,4 September 2014,"I always am abit apprehensive with these kinds of films. Especially when they are the found footage or supernatural types. They sometimes threaten to be crap & badly made. But this one was surprisingly quite good & had a pretty decent ending than what I was expecting.So, the film centers round a group of explorers who travel deep under the ground of Paris, so Scarlet can finish her passed away fathers work.The film was decent, though I do like my slashers & think that this generation is seriously lacking of them. Very badly! I so want to see another gory horror again!As I've also said before, I'm not into found footage or supernatural films at the best of times. But this film was alright. It was pretty good & had a decent enough ending which ended the film on a high note.The film was suspenseful & very creepy! You yourself, also felt what the characters were going through when they were crawling through the compact spaces & tunnels as the cameras mounted on their heads were kind of pushed in your face. The deaths were OK for found footage/supernatural films. But they aren't anything to get excited about. Though the creepy parts made this film better. The part where Scarlet sees a hanging body from the roof & when she takes the cloth covering the head it was a manic laughing woman! The was scary! The part with the burning car with the moving victim inside was twisted as with the part were Scarlet gets dragged under the thick sludgy bloody water with the creepy chants in the background! The statues coming alive & biting George! Then there was the end where they discover that placing the stone back in it's place & finding out everything is mirror imaged was pretty decent, considering it's like one of those films where everyone gets killed off & the camera cuts to the credits like the Paranormal Activity films do! But no, I was surprised to see that they would survive & to see how weird it was when they opened the man hole & found out they were upside down! It was when they threw their stuff out the man hole & onto the street where I thought ""Yes! The remaining 3 made it out alive!"" So, the film had a surprisingly decent & not sloppy ending! I also liked that it wasn't a sexist ending either, when there's a female soul survivor at the end!Overall, this was a pretty good film!

52,begob,Hell is other people,5,24 November 2014,"One scene in this movie really disturbed me - when Benji got wedged in the tunnel. I'm claustrophobic and had to close my eyes and cover my ears until it was over. I am not a girl.So with that effect behind me I expected some serious chills. The premise is great, I love that kind of yarn, and we were led into it at a good pace with sympathetic characters.Sadly not so much. The first disappointment was the undecayed knight's corpse. Oh dear, a large slice of Indiana Jones cheese. Hell was populated by extras in unconvincing makeup and costumes that had to be filmed with ""just a glimpse"" shaking camera-work. And the story turned out more moral than weird, as the characters were confronted with their own guilt (except for Siouxsie and Benji ""bungee jump"").The catacombs were a great location, but I wonder if the director might have added an element of the smell of the place to complete the sensory effect. Say, characters retching from the stink of Hell.I wonder too if they missed a trick in not having competition between the girl and the lead French guy - they both had a passion, she for the stone and he for the catacombs, so there could have been good conflict over that. Instead he lost his ""stones"" at the first sign of trouble and spent the rest of the movie quaking in his wellies.The manhole at the end was cool, but overall a failure of imagination.","As Above, So Below"

57,bob-the-movie-man,No amount of alchemy could turn this into gold,4,4 September 2014,"""As Above, So Below"" is mutton dressed up as lamb. A movie with such a marketing budget behind it should never be trusted.It starts with an Indiana Jones sort of vibe – actually, less Indiana Jones and more ""National Treasure meets Harry Potter"". Welsh born Perdita Weeks plays Scarlett, an archaeologist come alchemist come all round clever clogs who is obsessed with completing her dead-father's quest to find the famous 'Philosopher's Stone' (you see the Potter angle), supposedly buried with its 'inventor' Nicholas Flamel beneath the streets of Paris.She persuades ex-squeeze and ancient clock-mender (I'm not making this up) George (Ben Feldman) to join her on her underground quest , filmed by documentary maker Benji (Edwin Hodge) and roping in a bunch of Parisian adventurers who know the catacombs well. Through a series of rock falls and stupidity they are led deeper and deeper underground in their quest, and the deeper they go the more weird things get.Who will get out? Who won't? And more importantly, do we care? The answer is not very much. Whilst there are a few effective jolts along the way – a scene with a burning car is quite well done – much of the 'horror' is run of the mill ghost train stuff. The rest of the horror is associated with some of the acting.Cinematography is of the Cloverfield hand-held camera variety, which after 90 minutes gets tiresome and nauseating.""And the Oscar goes to.."" – – the head of marketing for Legendary Pictures.

58,witster18,"National Treasure meets The Descent... Mixed Emotions, Mixed Results",6,3 January 2015,"This film had potential. The setting, the claustrophobic nature of the film, and even the fantastical plot were all good ideas.Even the overall execution isn't bad, but some of the supporting cast is both under-developed and under-whelming.. not that the leads are Oscar contenders.The other factor here that has to be considered is the genre, and for a horror film, this is definitely passable. I'd say it's about even with ""The Afflicted"", and also uses shaky cam, but it's strides below ""The Descent"". The film needed to dive further into the plot and not further into the ground.There are some very well-done jump-scares, and a few nicely done horror backdrop-bad-guy-placements, but the film really could have taken better advantage of some of it's ideas. I liked the very end of the film, albeit somewhat predictable, but the extended ending(say the last 30 minutes), left some of the historical ideas on the back-burner.It was decent, but it could have been much better.

60,mikayakatnt,Terrible.,2,22 October 2020,"A horror movie where I actively wished for the death of the protagonist.As Above, So Below takes an interesting concept about the Parisian catacombs and tries to make a supernatural horror thriller from it. Yet, it falls flat on delivery and is riddled with horror movie cliches. It's not even that scary.It's subpar at best and not worth a second viewing. The audience never cares for the characters as there is no character development. No one learns to care for any of the characters and the movie becomes a slog through until the end credits.Perdita Weeks/Scarlett tries to be an adventurous protagonist but comes off as annoying and insensitive to artifacts. She's more of an annoying self-righteous vandal than an archaeological scholar. Can I blame her though? Seems that her character's flaws are more from the screenplay than the actor herself.And the movie is a bit confusing. The audience never understands the catacombs underground. Characters seem unaffected by pressure physics no matter how deep they go. No one makes a plan to get back out. Did I mention that new elements about the catacombs are constantly thrown into the movie? It makes quite a confusing experience.Also, just because this film references Dante's Inferno doesn't make this film ""deep."" Having characters with personal issues that come back to haunt them is a common movie trope. Having to do some googling after the film to find out who-did-what in their previous lives doesn't make this film interesting at all. The film ends up explaining all the relevant plot points rather than showing them to the audience. That's not good filmmaking, that's lazy filmmaking.1/5.

I re-watch this film from time to time, each time acknowledging the flaws it has, but still loving it.The film is very well done on a technical level, the tunnels feel authentic and claustrophobic enough, you never doubt that the characters are really there.The paranormal subplot is interesting, but it is shoved to the side, it is never the focus of the story. They provide for good interesting and scary imagery, but they never really dive deep into the characters, which, supported by the writing, should've been the main focus.Thus, the most interesting parts are rushed through, and some of the things established are left untouched and unanswered.Yet I still love this film and I might just give it a re-watch in a couple of years again. I can recommend this to horror fans because just how atmospheric it is, I wish they wouldn't rush through the important parts though.","As Above, So Below"
62,Superunknovvn,Delivers where other horror movies fail,7,30 September 2014,"""As Above, So Below"" is by no means a perfect movie. In fact, it's probably not even a 7, but more of a 6. However, director John Erick Dowdle gets an extra point for doing what so many other horror directors fail to do: He tries something new, and strikes a chord, even if his movie isn't entirely original. It mixes the claustrophobic setting of ""The Descent"" (or the cult novel ""House Of Leaves""), with an Indiana Jones like treasure hunt and presents it all in found footage fashion – a sub section of horror that unfortunately doesn't seem to go away any time soon.Still, ""As Above, So Below"" intrigues, because what the group of young people find, when they go down into the catacombs under Paris aren't the usual horror stereotypes. There are no zombies or vampires waiting down there. No creepy children with black hair. It's something much less defined and never totally explained. Horror movies stick to known patterns and paths way too often, when really it is the one genre, that should know almost no boundaries. John Erick Dowdle plays a little with the possibilities, with ways of manifesting fear. In the end not all of his attempts are successful. The scares aren't as intense as they should be, many plot points are silly, if you think about them.However, you start to get really uncomfortable as the characters get picked off one by one, and you're locked down there with them. The movie puts you in a deeply uncomfortable place and remains relentless until the very end. Doing so, it tickles a certain existential fear deep within – which is actually the reason why we watch horror movies in the first place: to make ourselves aware of our own mortality and come to terms with that fact that we have no idea what lies beyond this life.""As Above, So Below"" is not a groundbreaking genre movie, and it probably will not stand the test of time. However, in 2014 it's the best and most effective horror film I've seen in many years.","As Above, So Below"

I thought it started well enough (with some reservations), but it became disjointed and confusing in the second half.The Scarlett character was interesting (a teenage frenetic Indiana Jones on speed), but by the second half it was annoying me that she was solving these complex puzzles under intense pressure in just seconds. The George character: someone in his 20s who is an Aramaic expert and can fix medieval church clocks? GMAFB. What really annoyed me was when -- on the spot and under great pressure -- he translated a difficult to read text from Aramaic (?) into English, and it came out like a 19th century poem, rhyming and with words like ""twixt"". WTF?I thought I was following it all well enough but then the ""worst fear materialised"" theme arose. Yikes. That came out of nowhere. Even when the movie is over, it's not clear why that was added to the film. That idea has been around an awfully long time, but it was just unexpected and out of place here.The various alchemical, mythological and religious references were all a jumbled mess. The sunken cavern, the mass deaths, the gate to hell, the sound distortion, the treasure room, the philosopher's stone, the strange chanting women, the monk-like creatures, La Taupe, and so on. There were quite a few other unanswered points. They were introducing frightening elements for no reason other than to be frightening.I didn't find it that frightening. I looked at my watch several times during the movie. I groaned audibly a few times.I didn't really like the shaky cam and the found-footage concept. It's difficult to maintain that for very long. For those who died far underground, how did their footage survive? Who was filming them at the very end? It annoyed me that the characters were vocalizing so much. Yes, I know we needed that for dramatic reasons. I hated it. People don't do that in real life.I'd give this movie about a 5 or a 5.5. I've toured the Paris Catacombs, so I really wanted to like this movie. Sorry.","As Above, So Below"
65,dfa120374,An Excellent Addition To The POV Genre,8,22 January 2015,"I had been looking forward to seeing As Above, So Below since I saw the trailers for it, and after watching it, I'm glad to say that it most definitely did not disappoint. I really do not understand a lot of the criticism that it has received by some people. Maybe they were expecting some sort of ""monster"" flick, or it wasn't gory enough for them, or maybe they just didn't ""get it""...who knows. All I know is that it is nowhere near as bad as what people have made it out to be.On the surface, the story of the movie is not really all that original, but when you watch the film, you actually see that it's going for a sort of Dante's Inferno kind of showing with each group member going through their own personal journey through hell. If you watch it and pay attention then you will see this with the different scenarios each person has while travelling through the Catacombs. Knowing this and understanding what is going on makes the film better than your average run-of-the-mill POV movie that just lays everything out for you.The pace & development of the story is nicely done and once it gets going, it never really lets up as it goes along at a very nice pace without ever really slowing down. I loved the setting of the Catacombs as well as this brought it's own claustrophobic feeling (think of the potholing scenes in The Descent but double that) and the atmosphere that this brings really is nice & very tense. Add this to the very nice visual effects that accompany some scenes (and it's not a special effects ridden movie either) and you have yourself a really enjoyable film.The visuals in the movie are cleverly done - especially for the final scenes - and are not overused in any way. This isn't a movie that relies on a vast array of special effects or blood & gore to try and entertain...it relies on telling a really good, very atmospheric, and at times creepy, story.I absolutely loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone.","As Above, So Below"

67,DareDevilKid,"As Before, As Always - to be Avoided at all Costs",3,23 November 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsFor a horror movie, or at least one that claims to belong to the genre (unless I was misled), ""As Above/So Below"" is significantly bereft of anything horrific, remotely suspenseful,or mildly chilling. For a film that takes place underground in tightly enclosed spaces, it's surprisingly thin on suspense and palpable physical danger.After an intriguing setup that threatens to claw its way out of found-footage overkill, the ""As Above/So Below"" plummets into clichéd mediocrity. Once the characters go underground, things do start happening - not scary things, mind you, just random things. It is also quite impossible to set a film in the Paris catacombs and completely mess up the sense of grim, suffocating atmosphere...but this film even manages to achieve this bit of ignominy, and does so with relative ease.""As Above/So Below"" is visually incoherent, devoid of suspense, and propulsive in all the wrong ways. There may be an interesting story to be told about what exists under the streets of Paris; unfortunately, this film isn't it.","As Above, So Below"
68,RevRonster,The wasted potential this one had...,4,12 December 2014,"Geez! This film had so much potential to be a great horror film and it wasted all of it on a cheap, overused gimmick.The acting, the sound, and the story were all fantastic in this film. Not to mention that the catacombs in France made for a great locale that is not only interesting but all kinds of creepy. The potential this film had was limitless and it could have been epicif the film didn't make itself a ""found footage"" film.Adding in this overdone horror genre gimmick took away everything that could have made ""As Above, So Below"" stand out and just made it a cookie-cutter looking horror film that brought nothing new to the genre—even with its engaging and potentially horrifying story. Additionally, the ""found footage"" element makes so much of the story and plot incomprehensible due to the tired old ""shake the camera a lot"" and ""add some video and digital interference"" clichés...and were added far too liberally. For too much of the film, it's almost impossible to tell what exactly is happening and it makes the film a lot less terrifying and a lot more annoying.It upset me so much to see this potential wasted because this film could have been incredible if it only had worked to distinguish itself among all the other horror films but, instead, it painfully decides that it wants to not only look like all the other scary movies on the market right now but play out exactly like them, too. Such a waste.","As Above, So Below"
69,danielmanson,"Not bad, but confusing.",5,13 April 2019,"The title literally says it all for me. It's not going to be the worst film you're going to watch, but don't expect a great one either.Pros: Horror/Suspense element was done very well and kept me on the edge of my seat.
I gained a liking towards a lot of the main characters. Acting was also decent.Cons: I just didn't fully understand it, or the point of it. Without ruining the ending I thought it was just odd and pointless and gave no explanation whatsoever to what had happened the past 90 minutes.
Handheld camera throughout was ok, however there is a couple of horror scenes that didn't work whatsoever and just disorientated me.","As Above, So Below"

71,bbickley13-921-58664,Genuinely frighten by the whole thing,7,7 September 2014,"I really like this one.In yet another found footage movie, a student looking for the mythical Philosopher Stone is having her efforts documented by a student film maker. She ends up leading a team far into the catacombs under France to dark places where they should not go.Movie starts out very Indiana Jones like, but of course darker(and not as good) as PHD student Scarlet leads a literal crew of misfits into the catacombs under Paris to find a hidden chamber. It was very Tomb Raider like watching them go through hidden tunnels in a trail and fail adventure looking for the right way. Then the movie starts taking a supernatural turn as they get deeper and deeper into uncharted parts of the area, where the movie starts to prey on your beliefs in Hell, which is made scarier thanks to the found footage approach. By this point the story does lead you too much, becoming more like a Beat Em up than an open world game.The Ending was purposely lackluster making me indifferent about it but the acting by the young relatively unknown cast was stellar. As above, So below was a cool adventure, and some really good scares that made it a great watch.","As Above, So Below"

75,ArchonCinemaReviews,Horror? No. Marauder adventure? Heck yeah!,6,10 December 2014,"Once again movie executives get their grubby money-hungry hands on a perfectly good plot with As Above, So Below and force it into a cash cow horror.Admittedly the market for adventurous anthropological and archaeological treasure hunts based on history is pretty slim but As Above, So Below would have been an okay film without the unnecessary horror twist.Scarlett Marlow, portrayed by Perdita Weeks, is an academic heavy weight in the pursuit of one of the greatest archaeological treasures of all time, the philosopher's stone. She has risked her life on multiple occasions following the trail of history searching for the stone of Nicholas Flamel. Having just discovered radical information in Iran she is brought to Paris to venture in the miles of winding catacombs beneath the city. As she and her team of explorers journey deeper under the city and into the catacombs they journey into the darkness of horrors guarding the stone.The characters are all trite overly-intelligent characters, especially the protagonist Scarlett. Perdita Weeks plays her as smart, a leader, and stubbornly devoted to her search for the philosopher's stone. As far as female leads go she is gender neutral and refreshingly does not play into sexist female stereotypes. The rest of the supporting characters all do an sufficient job playing believably realistic roles.Delving into historical subjects reminiscent of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, alchemy and history, the subject matter written and later directed by John Erick Dowdle is rather pretentiously academic. Personally I am a fan of self-important intellectual teachings especially when they are a bit different than the normal bloated Hollywood drivel shoved upon audiences pretending to be scholarly, cough National Treasure.Shot in the token found-footage style on trend for horrors, As Above, So Below is purely a thrilling and suspenseful adventure film for almost the first sixty minutes. Once the lucrative horror does start As Above, So Below switches tone to the shakiest found footage scenes of the year, all spoiled in the trailer.Please check out our website for full reviews of recent releases.","As Above, So Below"
76,nitzanhavoc,"Nice build up, disappointing conclusion.",5,18 January 2015,"Let me start off by saying that the last ""mockumentary""/found footage Horror film I actually liked was The Blair Witch Project, and even that was only because it was ground breaking and innovative, inventing a brand new sub-genre of Horror. Ever since, every time I see this kind of film I am disappointed. This specific type of cinematography always seems confusing and unclear to me, which feels like a cheap trick. If a film aims at causing confusion and uncertainty, it should do so with a smart story and some plot twists, not with faded unclear shots and chaotic movement.To my delight, As Above, So Below managed to retain the unique cinematography of the sub-genre without getting too carried away, by allowing each character to have its own head-cam. That way the audience sees a combination of first person shots, along with third person shots taken by the main camera (conveniently taken along by the expedition's cameraman looking to do a documentary film about the group's journey).The plot very much reminded me of fantasy-history films like National Treasure and the cinematic adaptation to Dan Brown's novels. This time, the heroine aims at finding Nicholas Flamell's Philosopher Stone. To do that, she must embark on a journey below the city of Paris, to ancient catacombs. So far so good, nothing wrong.The problem, in my opinion, started when the supernatural motive was brutally, violently and clumsily stuffed needlessly into the story. Without giving away any spoilers - everything that happens since the collapsing of the treasure room wreaks of ""I have no ideas, let's use supernatural stuff"". It does add a nice philosophical touch, and the way the plot concludes is open to many interpretations, but that in my opinion does not qualify as a good conclusion process of a horror film. Parts of the film are indeed intense and the suspense at times keeps the viewer on edge, but having such an anticlimactic conclusion to the events and leaving that much room to assumptions and personal subjective interpretations - while probably aimed at giving the film additional value and dimensions, has sadly achieved the exact opposite.Did I enjoy the film? Most of it, yes. Would I recommend it? Only to devout found-footage fans, and other who haven't got an available alternative.","As Above, So Below"
77,namstonk,Terrible casting and shocking direction,1,14 July 2019,"Firstly your cast must be correct for the character. The lead is not in anyway believable, a professor 'seriously'. Based on this performance you wonder how she actually worked ever again, she ferrets around like a child on neat Kia-ora and pray she gets killed by a rabid stick insect with with a blunted whisk. Is it all her fault? Probably not, the director and script are shocking, it's meant to feel like a documentary piece with a covert camera in places etc, but it obviously feels nowt like it. There is just too much wrong with this film, you'll question everything, it happens from the start. The lead promptly says they have numerous PhD's, can speak numerous langages and dead one's but promptly cannot speak a language that would be wholly needed in their quest.
If it's on late at night and you're slightly squiffy from ale with a pizza or kebab then it'll be perfect for a laugh, otherwise just do not touch, it is awful.","As Above, So Below"
78,Just-A-Girl-14,Creepy as hell (see what I did there?!),8,26 February 2021,"I enjoyed this movie. I wish it was easier to find horror movies that are as creepy as this one. Most horror films lack a good plot. Not this one. I enjoyed the archeological/mystical aspect of it. Basically it's an exploration expedition going really wrong. I have to say I felt really claustrophobic watching them crawl in those scary tunnels. I also liked the reference to Dante's Inferno. It's sort of a modern way to tell the story. It wasn't a perfect movie but it was really good. The acting, filming and direction were good and so was the writing. I also liked the fact that it was not too gory. Most horror movies are filled with stupid characters, cheap jump scares and lots of blood and gore. Here we have an interesting plot and well written characters and even though some of their decisions weren't the smartest (like going in there in the first place) most were justified (like when they had no other choice). All in all I thought the movie was pretty good and definitely worth a watch.","As Above, So Below"

Before digging deeper into the plot which is basically what all the characters end up doing, I have a couple gripes. The casting went the wrong direction, way too many good looking people that were placed purely for eye candy and there was also a lot of unanswered questions. However, the scares were there, great writing, a few original concepts and overall a fun watch. If you can overlook some shaky found footage and a ""That's it?"" ending, I guarantee you'll enjoy As Above, So Below.","As Above, So Below"

I'd like to applaud the director and writers for their attempt translating a deep and complex story into an entertaining movie. This said, I had a few issues with the flow and build of tension.

It looked kind of scary, so I said why not. I was surprised, this movie had a plot, along with some thrills, and chills. The movie is about this group of young explorers who are looking for this treasure. The treasure has some mystical powers. It has the power to heal if used in the right way, along with some other powers. Along their journey the group takes a proper tour through the catacombs, then break off. They discover another part, and their adventure starts. Along the way the find that people use this area for weird rituals, discover a ghost who got lost down there never to be seen again. The area they are in starts to play mind games with each of the individuals. This part of the catacombs they are in is just spooky, which adds to the creepiness of the film. For a B movie this is actually good. I was surprised to know that they did actually film most of it in the catacombs. Which they had to get through the French government, but I thought sure some was done on a sound stage . So if you are looking for a creepy movie for a Friday night, check this one out. It is a good scary flick, without a lot of gore, and unlike most of todays horror it doesn't suck.THX, Kris L. CocKayne","As Above, So Below"

But; there are certain things this movie did so well that I think it definitely stands out from the bunch.

Though it may have elements of it ( spooky beings, bones, ghostly children and teracota zombies) it is really nothing scary! Action movies are scarier and more bloody than this one!The beginning of a movie in Iran has no meaningful connection to the part that is going on in Paris - or better say underground Paris. The fact that the main girl is adventurous could have been introduced differently. Although the movie is moving fast and the story is interesting, the movie lacks the details or something more concrete in my opinion to make it better. Catacombes of Paris are certainly interesting place for a movie and especially the fact that many maybe don't even know about it. I liked the mixture of English and French. The actors are good looking - which also is a plus for me, except La Taupe! And his role in the movie is totally puzzling to me. Not a bad movie, but not the great one either. OK to pass 90 minutes while you are waiting for a late bus. Six from me","As Above, So Below"
85,jackmeat,Found footage done right,7,22 May 2015,"My quick rating - 6,5/10. Not sure what @oklahoma ward and @nicole alonso did to me, but after #CRAWLorDIE it seems movies are all about caves, tunnels, and claustrophobia. Anyway, shameless plug aside, this movie is a very well done flick that keeps you wondering what is next. It take a little bit to get going, but after it does, it holds the audience quite well. The acting is as expected but I found the ""interview"" like scenes with Perdita Weeks as Scarlett doing a good job pulling you into the story. Yep, there is a story, even if it is far fetched. It is your hidden underground labyrinth with a hidden item (in this case a healing stone) that has been buried for centuries in the worlds largest tomb. The imagery of crawling around over bones and walking through corridors of skulls, etc. really brings out the atmosphere and makes the ""found footage"" take some validity for once and not using it as just a gimmick. The scares are there, subtly, but effective. After tons of ""found footage"" movies getting the idea completely wrong and just using the handi cam this way, finally another movie gets it right. Giving a feel of other movies such as Descent and the mentioned Crawl or Die with the horror and claustrophobic sense seems to be working as of late, and this is another that does it quite well. Definitely a good watch and such a cool ending to the whole story that drives you to ""the only way out is to keep going down."" After seeing the end, you will know what I mean. A great finish to a good entry into the genre. Enjoy.","As Above, So Below"
86,come2whereimfrom,Went in with low expectations and still disappointed.,2,1 September 2014,"As Above, So Below has the premise to be a great horror film on paper but sadly on the screen just signals the death of a genre made popular by 'The Blair Witch Project' some 15 years ago. Do you want to make a film but can't be arsed? Then make a shaky-cam film as there is little or no skill required to produce an hour and a half of headache inducing wobbly action. Starting in Iran before moving to the catacombs of Paris the camera work is so frenetic that I couldn't make out what the hell I was looking at most of the time it certainly didn't deliver on the promise of the great setting as this could have been any old cave by the time they finally get round to going there, and that's the films main problem it's just dull and drawn out. I've been to the catacombs (one of the reasons I went to see this film) and it is a quite scary place, the person I was with had a panic attack and yet none of this comes across in the film and this is before it spirals down into a mess of supernatural mumbo jumbo which just makes the last portion of the movie laughable. Plucky brit Lara wannabe Scarlett leads her team in to the caves like a poor man's Descent, two of her party are clearly only there to be killed off and may as well of worn a red Star Trek top each from the outset. Once inside they quest for a magic stone that has the ability to heal you if you get hurt therefore removing any suspense that might have been left in this vacuous borefest. All it took to make this film is any old cave, a group of models and a handful of Go-Pros and a way of reducing the majesty and history of the Paris catacombs into nothing more than a gimmicky footnote to get people in to the cinema.","As Above, So Below"
87,troyputland,Boring found footage horror.,3,10 June 2015,"Hand-held photography has been blown significantly out of proportion since The Blair Witch Project. If the so called 'found footage' is interesting enough and the handler isn't swinging the camera like a lasso then we're possibly in for a treat. As Above, So Below is the opposite. Dizzness, nausea and a hazy picture. The team of explorers, led by Scarlett (Perdita Weeks), takes them what feels like an age to encounter the celestial. The shots are quick and snappy, so the small glimpses are allowed. If you blink you'll miss the exciting parts. A small budget limits director Dowdle. The catacombs are full of unlimited filming possibilities, instead we're succumbed to murky images, a tedious front-woman and laughs where there should be frights. As Above, So Below's intriguing when bad tides hit the group. It at least grabs enough curiosity to see it out to its blank, scrappy ending.","As Above, So Below"
88,gustheaffen,Meh lame 2nd half,3,2 September 2019,Started off okay although the main character is an annoying know it all and then once they got into the tunnels the wheels fell off. Laughably bad and terrible ending. I would not have paid to see this one.,"As Above, So Below"
89,dommercaldi,"Had potential, but mostly terrible",3,25 March 2020,"Pros:
1. The scenes that take place in the enclosed spaces are incredibly stressful, tense, and they enable the viewers to feel the claustrophobia felt by the characters.
2. The tension and suspense in the build-up to Benji's (Edwin Hodge) death is done really well and sent shivers down my spine.
3. Perdita Weeks (Scarlett) and Ben Feldman (George) both give good performances.Cons:
1. François Civil (Papillon) and Hamid Djavadan (Reza) give very wooden performances.
2. There are a couple logical inconsistencies. For example, Benji films everything, even the things that are illegal. He does this whilst exclaiming about the illegality of those actions. Another example would be when the police somehow sneak up on the protagonists in the tunnel before they enter the catacombs.
3. The sound design is slightly off at points. For example, Papillon throws a smoke bomb on soil-laden Earth floor. Yet the sound that is emitted is that of a smoke bomb on a tiled floor.
4. George ends up in the catacombs unnecessarily just because he can't seem to say no to Scarlett.
5. The protagonists willingly follow La Taupe (Cosme Castro) even though he's clearly acting dodgy and mysterious. George even explicitly states he's leading them the wrong way, and Papillon concedes that La Taupe isn't acting himself. However, they all still follow him.
6. The characters of Zed (Ali Marhyar) and Souxie (Marion Lambert) are completely useless as they are given nothing to do with no character development to accompany it.
7. Most of the scares fall exceedingly flat.
8. Some of the cutting and editing are extremely obnoxious and annoying.","As Above, So Below"

91,SyoKennex,Racing Hearts to Disappointment,5,26 March 2017,"As Above, So Below is a mystery horror from the director of No Escape and Devil.Some found footage films are just a mix of bad tropes, where as some of them break the mould completely. Surprisingly, As Above, So Below is a rare mixed film that has aspects of both of these.Scarlett, an alchemy student, is on a quest to find Nicolas Flamel's Philosopher's Stone. Information she has found indicates that it is buried within the Paris Catacombs, and her and her small group must head underground to find it.The characters in this film are a mix of strong and weak. At some parts of the film, they can be strong, at others, they're just pathetically weak. The characters just aren't relatable at all and they're annoying at most points during the film. Scarlett was determined, but in deadly proportions and honestly, everyone in this film should have died with her lead.As Above, So Below is different. It was original in some tones – the Paris catacombs, the plot line of the film and the characters themselves, but also, it was just boring. It was a good mix of excitement and pure boredom. The creators of this film did well in creating atmosphere, but were just as good at creating boredom. Tenseness changed to 'did they really do this that was horrendous' and racing hearts give way to 'was that it'.Original, but also not so original, exciting, but also not so exciting, this is not a recommendation from me.","As Above, So Below"
92,Jerghal,Original idea gets cheap execution,6,23 November 2014,"I welcome the fact that they try a new idea, a horror film in the Parisian catacombs instead of an evil entity in a house for example. It's a sort of a found footage film which unfortunately also means that you have lot's of shaky POV camera work. That normally doesn't bother me as they intercut it with some regular camera shots but here that's almost not the case. The only time the camera stays still is when they lay the camera on the ground. Another reason you get the shaky treatment is to cover up lack of budget. At one point a guy gets stuck in a cave tunnel. The tunnel is a about to collapse (you hear them say it and a rumbling sound). They shake the camera a bit, the guy jumps out and all of a sudden it's collapsed. There also an enormous amount of set recycling going on (you'll notice) which they try to explain/cover up with the plot but it doesn't work. The movie it resembles most is 'The Descent', but that one had tons of atmosphere. This one is not really scary, it could have been if they'd put in a bit more effort. The director of this film also did 'Devil' and 'Quarantine' (the US remake), two films which also came up short...","As Above, So Below"

Surely having some brainy old scientists among this group of curious teens would of made it make more sense. But no. Other horror movies all have hot stars so this one has to too.It goes without saying that the shaky camera work in the film can just come of as irritating. But the fact that it wants to be the next ""Paranormal activity"" or whatever isn't its biggest downfall. What messes it up completely is its lack of story, or even structure. Its just a mishmash of different ideas thrown together to make an odd (yet not very good) movie, and the occasional glimmer of fear is usually short lived in a blink and you'll miss it moment. That you'll probably forget about when the film spends a majority of its time being daft.Don't get me wrong. There are some genuinely scary moments during the finale of this otherwise stupid movie. But you have to follow typically stupid characters, through a silly non-sensical plot. Plus put up with the overdone, shaky camera work (that feels more un-necessary than usual) in order to get to them. Most of the film completely lacks any suspense as it quickly jumps from one of its ideas to the next. One idea will be good, and then the next two will be rubbish.","As Above, So Below"
94,MikesIDhasbeentaken,good if you like the genre,6,3 March 2015,"if you like found footage horror films, you'll like this, if not.. then you won't. this film is pretty simple in that respect, it won't get a new audience, or loose the fans the genre already has, there's a hand held camera in the catacombs under Paris, and s*it happens. For me, it's great, i enjoyed it and i liked the way they didn't follow the normal tradition of killing the characters off in order of how many lines they had up till that moment, and actually you didn't know who was going to go next or who might survive. Ending was a really cheap gimmick that i though was a bit of a let down but other than that a good film for anyone that likes similar offerings.","As Above, So Below"
95,rlaine,Found footage horror meets Indiana Jones,8,30 January 2017,"I'm not a huge fan of documentary style ""found footage"" movies, I prefer the traditional way where the camera ""doesn't exist"", so I wasn't initially too excited to watch this, but decided to give it a go as the rating was quite high.Positive things first. It's a good movie, I have to say that. It's basically very well made, very good story and even tho I'm not a huge fan of the style, it was well made. There are some genuinely creepy moments and the few fx scenes were quite creative. The script and story were really interesting, it wasn't just dumb teens lost in the catacombs, but there actually was a Indiana Jones style story. I can't say if the story was water proof or just pseudo-smart, but it provided enough beef for the movie to be interesting. It felt as if the writer(s) had actual interest in the subject.The negative things then. The shooting style wasn't my favorite, I can't help it, but I just felt this had been an amazing movie had it been shot traditionally. Having said that the style itself worked quite well, if you're into it. I don't know if the cameras would've survived everything they went through in the movie, but it worked quite well in the end. The other gripe I have is the acting, combined with the style it felt a bit unintentionally goofy at times. Kind of like the style they used in The Office (deliberately), people not quite sure whether they should look at the camera or not, awkward moments etc.There are some elements in the movie which don't make much sense or aren't really explained (the ""cult"", the phone, the story of La Taupe etc..), but they do add to the creepiness.All in all a positive experience tho, especially liked the inspired and Indy style story, quite unusual for this kind of horror movie.","As Above, So Below"
96,lorcan-61881,A terrifying horror film from the director of no escape and the Poughkeepsie tapes,8,9 October 2016,"As above so below is a horror film from another one of my favourite modern horror film directors. Its about a girl that thinks the..don't die laughing when I say this..the philosophers stone,yeah they pretty much just got that stone of Harry Potter and just threw this in here,is in the undergrounds in Paris and decides to go down with a couple of people. BUT,when the people cant get out they are tormented by some very scary ancient creatures that are not human. I freaking loved this film so much,I actually screamed when I watched this no kidding when I saw that girl jump out with a baby I think,I went screaming. As above so below is a classic modern horror film along with the amazing other two modern horror films that I love the conjuring 1&2.","As Above, So Below"
97,jackgdemoss,Not bad for a shakey cam found footage type,7,3 August 2021,"I have been meaning to see this horror film for years. Noticing it is on Netflix, I finally got around to it. The entire adventure is a giant metaphor for Dante's Inferno. I personally know very little about that piece so I couldn't appreciate that at the time. For those like me, this is a solid adventure horror that is focused and sometimes a bit cheesy.","As Above, So Below"
98,harrylosborne,"Decent story, poor acting, falls in the mid-ground",6,29 January 2021,"A horror with a rating above a 6 and some actual acclaim? I thought, this cannot be true. Still, I felt it was worth trying at least, and the Parisian catacombs make a more intriguing setting than most you see in the oh-so-formulaic genre.In the depths of Paris' underground, this modern adaptation of the Seven Levels of Hell (from Dante's Inferno) was actually well founded; instead of just winging through a frail plot, some literary significance was afforded to the story.This is not entirely backed up by the found-footage concept (pretty strung out now) or the acting (which is worse), but still creates a better horror than we're used to. The idea of looking for the Philosopher's Stone is fine, but falls away when you introduce the rest of the cast: this includes some unhinged French spelunkers, an American documentary maker and a criminal repairman (really).In the catacombs themselves, various horror clichés are used (with a decent combination of audial and visual scares), but it isn't much you won't have seen before. Furthermore, plot holes are rife throughout, and some of the decisions the group make might also be seen as slightly nonsensical.The conclusion is probably the biggest shock: there actually is one! Still, for a dose of horror that doesn't lean completely on jump scares, you could do a lot worse.","As Above, So Below"
99,pensacolacomputer,Very nice surprise!!,7,30 August 2014,"I am SO glad I did not listen to the reviewers and saw this movie last night. In a way it did help though because I went into this movie expecting it to be a BIG piece of crap. But this movie scared the s*** out of me and my friend!! I would say its a cross between In the mouth of madness and Descent.I was WRECKED when I left the theater. This was the type of movie that stuck with me well after I left. Driving home I still felt like I was still there in the theater going through what I just saw.This movie is not for everyone though. If you are expecting some Oscar winning movie, look somewhere else. But if you go in with a open mind, you might be extremely surprised like I was. Go check it out for yourself and decide!","As Above, So Below"
100,isantistao,Way Better Than Blair Witch,9,10 November 2019,"This is a movie that is like the Blair Witch Project, but on steroids. It is a really amazing found footage adventure film with a lot of mysticism. It explores the subjects of alchemy, other realms that may exist literally right beneath ours, and mans spiritual quest for salvation, liberation, self actualization, attainment, enlightenment, or whatever it is you may be seeking, which you must journey through the dark night of the soul to find. It is very creative and original and is well shot, much better than most found footage films, probably one of the best. For a lover of found footage style films, horror movies, fantasy/mystical/spiritual films, you will enjoy this one.","As Above, So Below"
101,datorsiers2,"As above, So below, exactly.",7,3 December 2014,"A strange movie, but different from others, since it felt so real. In my opinion all the unexplained beings walking around the catacombs weren't really necessary, because without any background information about them it is not really interesting. I feel like this is a different version of The descent, though this one has a better setting, the catacombs look more interesting and there is a glimpse of magic in As Above, So Below. Movie made up for its flaws by Scarlet being in the leading role, a really attractive actress, who looks great no matter what, even when she is all covered in blood and bruised. Her courage lead the group through the catacombs and without her the movie would have been boring. Also props to the directors for not making the black guy die first like in every other horror movie.","As Above, So Below"
102,Mivas_Greece,A very good suggestion for the genre and one of the best claustrophobic thrillers.,7,24 January 2021,"Horror / mystery movie. An extremely claustrophobic and generally dark thriller shot with a moving camera (like REC, Cloverfield etc). The protagonist tries to complete her father's research on the search for an ancient artifact, the philosophical stone. She illegally assembles a small group to follow the elements that lead her somewhere near the catacombs of Paris. They enter through some hidden entrances and dare to go through passages that no one had gone for hundreds of years until then. From the moment they enter these passages, and as they go deeper and deeper into the earth, strange things happen that confuse the protagonists and the watcher who does not know if they are real or illusions. Whatever is down there, however, is much more and darker than the philosophical stone they are looking for. Eventually the only way out is to keep going further and further down and deeper. Many things from the middle of the journey onwards are inexplicable and even more strange is the end that confuses the watcher even more. Although it does not have many effects and does not show many things, the film is shot in such a way as to capture the anxiety of the protagonists, who performed very well, and also to maintain a high level of suspense until the end of the film. It is somewhat reminiscent of The Descent (2005) in terms of claustrophobic style in caves and passages. A very good suggestion for the genre and one of the best claustrophobic thrillers.","As Above, So Below"
103,happy_hangman,Better Below...and left there!,2,15 March 2015,"Within the first ten minutes of this film the plucky heroine has her chum translate an ancient Aramaic tablet (from Iran, oddly, where Aramaic is not known to have been spoken): mysteriously it comes out in English as perfect iambic tetrameter/ rhyming couplets...as did cryptic verses by Flavel (one of my personal favourite Renaissance Hermeticists...and I have a few). A little surprising.This slipshod use of translating the ancient and arcane into the commonplace illustrates the problem which keeps this flick below par, as much as below ground. It doesn't know what it wants to be. They've lumped Dante, Flavel, Hermes Trismegistus and the idea of the Philosopher's Stone together in such a way as to confuse the hell out of anyone who hasn't heard of this stuff, and bug the ever lovin' cack out of anyone who has. Almost as though they've looked up 'Hermeticism' on Google and taken note of a few names which sound impressive...but without bothering to understand them.","As Above, So Below"
104,skrstenansky,Bad,1,14 October 2021,"This movie could have been something if it was not executed so terrible and poorly. The writing is bad, the plot is pretty bad, and it's trying too hard to be overly scary, and its completely stupid. The idea was good, going into catacombs under Paris, shot in found footage style and set as a horror movie, but was executed terribly. Do not watch, forgettable piece of garbage.","As Above, So Below"
105,FKDZ,Engrossing Adventure Into Hell,8,31 July 2021,"I am pretty excited after having just seen this movie. Imo its one of the best thriller/horror adventure movies I've seen in a long time. First off, I love the mystery adventure aspect of it. Ancient mythical texts and old writing.. perfect. I had a lot of tomb raider and/or National Treasure feelings, especially in the first half.But once we go down. Man this movie nails it. Coincidentally I have been to the Paris catacombs myself and yeah, it is as weird and creepy as its shown. But its not overblown in this movie, just the visuals and darkness are weird enough and it works.The acting is fantastic, the characters aren't as fleshed out as I'd have liked, but they felt real. There was a surprisingly lack of typical horror movie stereotypes and that was a breath of fresh air. In a lot of ways this movie really went against a lot of my typical horror movie expectations and I loved that.The directing is pretty good overall, of course.. its is a ''found footage'' movie but it's thankfully not obnoxious. Also I think this method of filming was perfect to immersive the viewer in darkness, confusion and claustrophobia. Towards the end though, a bit too much flickering for my tastes.The sound design and music is top notch, definitely watch this movie with some decent bass, good headphones or surround sound. Without good sound I could see this movie being way less impactful than its supposed to be. The sound really drags you into those caves.Now I noticed this movie is heavily inspired/based on Dante's inferno, and even though I wasn't familiar with that, I still really enjoyed it, and finding out after, made it even better. Because the ending does seem a bit too quick if you're not aware of the whole story. That said, you do get to understand snippits here and there even without the knowledge of DI.Overall I really enjoyed this. The vibe, the scares. It was really good. 8/10.","As Above, So Below"
106,lnvicta,"Found-footage Horror 101 - Other movies, take notes.",6,4 May 2015,"This is one I was excited for. The found-footage genre has been on life support for a while now but this one had a cool premise in a great setting - the catacombs. Seriously, that alone makes the movie worth a watch if you're a horror fan. The unsettling atmosphere, the claustrophobia, the creepy imagery, all while delving deeper and deeper into the Earth.I feel like this is a no brainer but if you're not a found-footage horror fan then you won't like this one. You've seen it all before and this is no different. All the usual plot devices and tropes that come along with the genre are here - it's just executed with finesse. The setting has a lot to do with it: It sets up the tone of the movie and keeps that ominous vibe present throughout. There aren't many surprises to be found here. It's a found-footage movie so it takes a little while to get going, but once it hits its stride it becomes a truly exciting adventure to be on. You really get the first person feel in this movie. They don't need excuses to be documenting this - they're explorers. We're just watching what they saw. That little sense of believability goes a long way in helping the movie's credibility and effectiveness.There are few actual scares in As Above So Below. It has an atmosphere similar to The Descent and keeps the slow eerie pace throughout the first two acts of the film. That in my opinion is the greatest strength of this film, and any others of its ilk - the focus on atmosphere rather than shock horror or jump scares. In the third act, sh*t starts to go down, and it goes down big time. It's not anything spectacular, none of the film is honestly, but I was satisfied at the end of this movie and that's more than I can say about a lot of the found-footage movies I've seen recently.A pleasant surprise in horror is good acting, and this movie thrives on it. Even though it takes a while for the movie to kick off, it's fun being introduced to these characters and starting this adventure with them because they are convincing in their roles and they actually have personality. You can identify with the two leads - one is the ambitious adventurer, the other is the neurotic realist. Then there's the eccentric and unreliable ""tour guide"" that introduces them on this hellish quest. It's just a lot of fun to be a part of this journey because none of us know what will be waiting for us on the other side.Overall this is just a well made found-footage movie. It has the chills, it has the thrills, and the added bonuses of good acting and an excellent premise. Horror fans will certainly get a kick out of it, and even if you're just looking for a midnight creep movie then As Above, So Below will not disappoint.","As Above, So Below"
107,utahman1971,I hate found footage but....!,10,23 May 2017,"This is surprisingly awesome for a found footage. I hate shaky camera movies with a passion but this one blew my mind for horror. Sorry, TBWP fans. I hate TBWP and never liked it but this one compared to it, blows it out of this world. I went and saw TBWP, and wish I asked for money back.I did not watch this one in the theater but for free with friend owning it. I thought before knowing it was a found footage and was debating to watch it, because of this. I finally jumped in and took the chance and do not regret it but glad I did. This was an awesome movie for a found footage.Like I said that I hate shaky camera, but what I really love was the continuous pace it had. No just boring parts like on TBWP. I like the part where they first realized they were going in circles and going through the same places they already been. That creep me out. I was blow away that they kept seeing things come at them.Another thought when they went in the catacombs was The Descent, that movie I really love too but not much a found footage. George I like and all the movies I saw him in, he did great. So when I saw him in it, knew he would be just as good or better. This is one I would try to get on bluray and watch a lot.","As Above, So Below"
108,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,"Didn't turn base metals into gold, but maybe silver",9,8 July 2021,"I am not sure the film really needed to be 'found-footage' (it doesn't add that much) and it is by no means without flaws, but I found it vastly more interesting than most contemporary horror. Claustrophobia and being trapped underground is - as usually - more terrifying than monsters, the alchemy-related background ties well with both the setting and adds some depth to the story (though ok, the 500 year old mechanisms and traps could be left out) as it kind of justifies the surrealist, literal, creepy descent into hell.That said, there is a lot that could have been done better: the characters discover the almost living body of Nicholas Flammel (or two of them actually) and that is just ignored and never revisited; the 'you have to face your deepest fears to escape' gimmick is trite, woefully overdone and only serves to unceremoniously dispose of a couple of characters; the main character just casually goes back after oops, got the wrong stone, and all the climbing gear, ropes, everything is still there.All in all, there was a lot of room for improvement, but still, originality and genuine creepiness make this well worth watching.","As Above, So Below"
109,HorrorFan1984,"As Above, So Below",7,5 May 2020,"A group of young people must face their demons and actual demons in the Catacombs of Paris.Our main character is Scarlett who is an archaeologist and explorer of all historical and ancient things. She has enlisted the help of Benji, a videographer who plans to record their journey in the depths of Paris for a documentary he's completing. The search is for the philosopher's stone which Scarlett has discovered is 370 feet below ground in the Catacombs of Paris. While down there, the group encounters a lot of religious and demonic imagery. The further they go, the more confusing things get as well. The enter rooms and areas that mirror image places they just left minutes ago. Eventually, the evil forces attack the group one by one until the remaining people are forced to face their inner sins and guilts or be trapped down there forever.There are really effective scares when the group is down in the catacombs. With it being a found footage film, there are a lot of jump scares that come from when the camera swivels quickly to an eerie image of something down there. I give a lot of credit for the filmmakers getting permission to film in the actual catacombs and not creating a set, very neat. Some of the things they were able to do down there are impressive. Also, I am not a claustrophobic person .... but this movie made me feel it. I felt all the beats of being in such a tight dark space with no idea what lurks around each corner.The film loses me a bit on character development which is big for a movie like this. Not only should I care about these people, but I should have an even better understanding of their pasts and sins to make better connections to what they go through in the catacombs. Pretty decent acting from pretty unknown actors, Perdita Weeks leading the charge as Scarlett. I just found the script didn't take time to develop the characters other than an extremely basic overview of what they've done/or lost in their pasts.As Above, So Below is a pretty effective found footage/claustrophobic look into the Catacombs of Paris. It works well as a horror movie as there are plenty of nerve racking tense scares. Shoddy character development and script, but overall a must see for any horror fan for sure.7/10","As Above, So Below"
110,TheRadiobox,Adventure/horror at its best,7,1 April 2021,"As Above, So Below was directed by John Erick Dowdle, written by John and Drew Dowdle, and stars Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Ali Marhyar, Francois Civil, Edwin Hodge, and Marion Lambert. It's about a group of explorers attempting to escape the catacombs beneath Paris.The Plot: Reinvention of the wheel is a fair way to describe ""As Above"" since it takes a relatively basic series of claustrophobic events and combines them with a story; something nearly every other spelunking horror has neglected to do. Scarlett (Weeks) has ventured to Iran and found the Rose Key, one of the last clues to finding the Philosopher's Stone. Now in France she has Benji (Hodge) document her travels, and George (Feldman) to translate the symbols. Upon finding out the stone is right under Paris, she enlists further help from explorers Papillon (Civil), Zed (Marhyar), and Souxie (Lambert) to take them below and find the stone. Predictably, the group is trapped inside the catacombs. However, unpredictably, they must go down to get out; with each significant drop in depth the world twists and tests the group's limits in an Alighieri-esq descent.The Characters: Again, the Dowdle brothers have changed formula for the better by finally providing likeable, if not especially complex characters. A handful of them are clearly fodder, sure, but none of them are despicable enough to warrant chants for their deaths. Scarlett is perhaps too OP. Fluent in four languages, a professor with a Ph. D., a symbols expert, and nearly fearless. Her father was renowned for his studies of alchemy, which drove him to obsession and eventual death. Scarlett's goal is noble: find the truth and restore his reputation. George is a B&E specialist who fixes old monuments and a sometimes partner, sometimes romantic flame who had travelled with Scarlett before; but after being stuck in a Turkish prison (no that's not an Airplane! Reference. I think.) went his own way. Papillon is a thrill-seeker that has found a way to profit off his experience in the catacombs, taking people down for a price and with a limit. Benji is essentially a worrisome camera and the other two are just there.The Horror: Plenty of different aspects make the scares in ""As Above"" work, but most of the legwork is done with parallels to Dante's Inferno and by tying in the backgrounds of the characters to the present. As the characters go off-track (or on track according to Scarlett) they come across a path that has been closed off and steeped in superstition after a friend of Papillon's who lived in the catacombs went in and never came out. All other options are exhausted and once they go in, they must go down. For lack of a better word, each ""level"" is inspired by Inferno, which not only adds variety to the scares and another way for those who know of it to enjoy the movie; but elevates the progression by default. Spatial logic gets looser and butts get tighter as the outlet of escape gets closer and may or may not even be feasible. Linking the levels of ""Hell"" and by proxy, sin, also adds depth to the characters as they unravel and admit (or perform) their wrongdoings. It's smart writing even if some of the scares are cheap.The Technics: Mileage is gotten out of the fact that most of the movie was filmed in previously unseen areas of the Parisian catacombs. For those who have seen or been there, this addition of the unknown ups the sense of adventure that permeates the movie. Found footage Indiana Jones. The atmosphere that shows so clearly is smudged at bit by the references to ancient Egypt in French catacombs. Myself not knowing much about Nicolas Flamel (the historic figure who is alleged to have created the Philosopher's Stone) may be at fault for being ignorant of his potential adventures but the plot pointing to a place so far from the setting feels a bit like the Dowdles got to a point where they wanted to combine cool stuff. Pacing does eventually collapse (get it?) too. The third act gets overblown and the conclusion feels rushed and could've done with 5 more minutes to elaborate on the reveal about Scarlett.As Above, So Below is a mostly successful movie that benefits from authenticity and creative references to famous literature. For a popcorn horror movie, especially a found footage horror movie, this is hard to beat.73/100.","As Above, So Below"
111,ten-thousand-marbles,Entertaining premise. Too many flaws.,5,27 July 2020,"An expedition/treasure hunt into the Paris catacombs. An interesting idea. The first half hour of the movie sets this up nicely. Then the decent. The rest of the story takes place in the underground mystical fun house, complete with random magic tricks, apparitions and homicidal rock people. The scare factor relies heavily on the constant panic and hysteria of the characters, and the random, nonsensical freaky things that happen. On a side note, I find hand held camera footage in the dark to be distracting, and this was most of the movie. It was mildly entertaining and it doesn't stop for a second. This along with a decent level of scary was it's salvation. I would have liked to have seen their journey play out with a little more thought and a little less luck.","As Above, So Below"

114,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This is A Great Film and I feel it is very Underrated!. In my opinion This is the Best Horror Movie of 2014.,9,6 January 2015,"I don't understand the hate for this film and I think it's bashing is undeserved. I found this film to be quite original and I liked some of the ideas the film had. One idea I liked is the cameras being on the helmets of each person so instead of having just one camera you have lots and you can see things from each person's point of view. shaky camera can be annoying but one thing the camera accomplishes is it makes you feel like your in the film and I think that's cool.there is also a very cool and original twist at the end of the movie that I have never seen in a movie before EVER, watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
I found this film impressive and the story was interesting and I liked Most of the characters,and I actually cared about what happened to them,also The acting was okay from everyone involved.This film was actually shot in the Real catacombs in Paris which I thought was really cool.The story is about a women who goes into the catacombs with her friends to find the philosophers stone because she wants to continue her father's legacy so she goes to find it.I will Admit this film is similar to the Decent,but there are some differences between the films because in this film they are searching for items. I love the Decent but I also liked this film and I enjoyed the adventurous aspects of the film,it had elements of tomb raider in it and it had the feel and atmosphere of the Decent. As above so belows story was interesting and involving and I was constantly immersed in the film and I always wondered what would happen next. The film was quite creepy at times and I liked the Dark atmosphere the film had. This film is Not bad or cliché like most people have said and that's because it's unpredictable and things happened throughout the film that constantly surprised me,and the characters were actually good! Which is something most horror films seem to be missing. I will admit the lead girl was a bit obsessive at first but as the film went on her character grew on me and I started to like her and that's because she cared about her friends and she tries to help them.The film has some mythology in it and some mystery so if people like films like that then I highly recommend the film. There aren't many films I can think of that are like this except maybe the Decent or tomb raider and that's only tomb raiders adventure side. As above so below had a good blend of horror,adventure and found footage and I found that refreshing and I have never seen a film that mixes those three genres together which is why I think this film is unique and original. This is one of the creepiest horror films of 2014 and there were some scary moments toward the end of the film.This film also has genuinely creepy moments,the film had scares that actually worked unlike most horror films where we get lame jump scares. The scares in this film worked better because they were unexpected and genuinely creepy. The film had an interesting and engaging story and I really liked the adventure aspects of the film when the characters were searching for objects I found it entertaining.The film had me on the edge of my seat throughout and I found the mysticism of the story interesting too and it made me want to see more and I got very involved in the film and I felt like I was in the film while watching it,there are also some good twists and ideas near the end of the film that I've never seen before.This horror film was refreshing and unique and this is how you do horror the right way with likable characters and genuinely creepy scenes,but also an involving and entertaining story.The film was Very good and I recommend it.","As Above, So Below"

117,stefankrs,Horrible,1,15 September 2021,This movie is decent and promising at first but then throws it all away. It goes that a group of people go into the paris catacombs to find treasure and some artifact and they then become trapped and lost in a cave system that has strange things going on. It tries too hard to be scary by showing guys in cloaks and people chanting trying to be scary. They add things from people's past in the movies that nobody knows about and tries to scare with that and its just plain stupid. They add too much stuff to attempt at scaring you but it just doesn't work and becomes so stupid to the point the add a magic healing stone to revive a dying person. Terrible movie.,"As Above, So Below"
118,HorrorOverEverything,"Works Pretty Well As An Adventure Movie, Not So Much As A Horror Movie",6,6 September 2014,"From the trailer I expected this to be a non stop exciting horror movie. However the trailers contained the majority of the horror elements of this film with the rest of the movie mostly being an adventure movie along the lines of Indiana Jones and National Treasure.""As Above So Below"" Isn't really even a horror movie until the last 25 minutes or so. What you get in the first hour is a fairly entertaining story about a treasure hunter out to prove that her father was not crazy. This works well, and I enjoyed the majority of it. There are some cool treasure hunting moments, the characters are likable enough, and watching the main character uncover hidden ancient clues is pretty fun.Then the movie shifts into horror mode and this was its weak point for sure. The last 30 minutes is not bad, but it just felt rushed. Almost as if they wrote 3/4's of the movie to be an adventure flick then decided at the last minute to make it a horror film. Also as I said before, if you have seen the trailer then you have pretty much seen just about every Horror scene in the movie.I liked this movie, but the horror aspects just didn't work well and almost made it feel like an incomplete movie. It is an entertaining right though.6/10","As Above, So Below"
119,thilagaraj-96121,Best film ever I watched,10,30 March 2020,I watched this movie on home theater. The sound effects and story moving was awesome. The story ended positively. worth to watch.,"As Above, So Below"
120,CowherPowerForever,No One Owns a German Car Out of Warranty,2,2 September 2014,"First and foremost I despise the sub-genre that is found footage but, I always give the films a chance, no matter how awful I think the movie will be. Paranormal Activity has taken this sub-genre by storm in recent years, and might be the worst movie franchise ever made in my opinion. This film adds some nice elements to the genre but, it fails big time to deliver anything worth value. This is my review of As Above/So Below.The film was poorly written by Drew Dowdle and John Erick Dowdle(who also directed). Both of these guys wrote one of the worst horror movies together in Quarantine. That movie was just pure trash, so I guess I shouldn't at all be surprised how sloppy this film was. This found footage horror movie actually adds something different to the sub-genre which is searching for a long lost treasure. This film early on comes off as a poor version of the Nation Treasure series that started several years back. Then the horror elements start to drop into the film, and while the idea is not bad, the writing was very sloppy. The film doesn't hold together well at all, and often times during the movie you will wonder if these two writers even took the script seriously or were they just throwing garbage at the wall. The effort overall from these two was very poor in my opinion, which is sad because the story idea itself is not bad at all.John Erick Dowdle as I mentioned above also directed this film, and he also directed the downright awful film Quarantine, which I attack above for being the trash we all know it was. Moving on though, this found footage massacre of film making was truly awful and director John Erick Dowdle deserves the most of the blame as he not only help write the film(I use that term loosely by the way)but, he directed the film as well. I don't hate found footage movies, I'm always open to the idea but, when the idea is executed so poorly like in this film, I have to call it out for being the trash it really is. Some of the shots in the film, or the death scenes if you will, aren't bad but, they are bogged down by sloppy writing, which I mention above. With a run time nearing ninety minutes, the pain of sitting in the theater watching this film slowly move by(and I mean slowly) was killing me. The acting in this film doesn't help as well. The notable star of the film is Ben Feldman(George) who is well known in the horror genre over the recent years. His acting, much like in his others films, is very weak to say the least. I can't really trash the acting that much as bad acting is much to be expected in a film like this. Dowdle delivers another poor effort to his filmography with As Above/So Below, and this might be the sign of most of his future efforts as well.Overall, the effort from the film makers here was overall very poor. Fans of the found footage sub-genre will likely watch this film at some point but, the best idea is to wait for home video and rent the movie. For horror movie fans who really aren't into found footage, there is no reason to ever watch this awful film. Save your time and money.2/10","As Above, So Below"
121,boris_unanimate,A Terrifyingly Effective Modern Horror,7,28 October 2019,"I enjoyed this superb movie from start to finish, which is usually hard to find, a movie that keeps your attention with every moment. It has several predictable, but still very effective jumpscares. It starts out like a modern Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider found footage thriller, but it gets weirder and more bizarre once the story goes underground and into the supernatural.The movie has its share of exposition, but it never beats you over the head with it. This is a good mix of The Descent meets Indiana Jones meets Uncharted meets Baskin, and if you enjoyed any of those, you will love AASB. Its message was similar to Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain. An enthralling and unforgettable experience unless you're scared of tight spaces and graveyards. Claustrophobics, beware!","As Above, So Below"

123,WasiReviews,"Had Potential, Failed Miserably",4,11 November 2021,"As Above So Below had a lot of potential, after watching the Descent (2005) I was hoping for a similar experience but not quite as good. Unfortunately for me, I went through an experience that was far worse maybe not even half as good as the Descent. First of all the rules of the horror movie make no sense; they traverse through the Catacombs of Paris but sometimes the demons want to kill them and other times they let them go. There are no set rules inside this film everything is nonsensical and messy. If you can't make up rules and everything just happens randomly in a jumbled unentertaining visual mess then I can't give the film a good rating and that's why critics probably gave this film such poor ratings, I will give it credit for having found footage as the video format but the fact that everyone had a camera on their head and they kept switching between the cameras added to my disorientation. Honestly, this isn't the kind of disorientation that is entertaining it's just poor decision-making from the director and cinematographer. I will give the film another piece of credit for the cool Iranian underground beginning sequence and some of the plot points inside the cave. The actors did very well with what they were given and that's probably the reason my review is as high as it is. The dynamics between Scarlett and George plus the overall acting were the only thing keeping me invested in the film. I don't have motion sickness before you claim that I only hated the cinematography because of the found footage format. I love found footage films and Cloverfield (2008) is among my all-time favorite films this film was just very poor in the quality of the picture. Keep this in mind if you intend to watch the film.","As Above, So Below"
124,careybrandon-41144,Different and suspenseful,7,3 April 2021,"Another found footage horror film, but it adds some flavor to the common type of shaky hand held cameras. With a pretty unique location of the underground catacombs in Paris, and some very effective scares and effects. I wouldn't mind watching this one again.","As Above, So Below"
125,sjarja,disappointing script,3,4 April 2015,"Well, let me start with the statement that i am kind of sick with pseudo scientific stories (which are actually fantasy at its core but spend a considerable amount of time with techno-babble) conducted by a cast that simply breaks any sense of immersion. The scientists seem to be inspired by Indiana Jones and Lara Croft - without admitting to the great cheese of Indiana Jones movies or the fantasy adventure of Tomb Raider. The result is spending a long time following those guys doing boring stuff and running into convenient incidents ... mostly done in a shaky camera.ahh.... shaky camera... where to start. I do not like it - BUT - it does make sense when the cameraman is PART of the story - when he is actually THERE. But when the cameraman is behind the fourth wall - a person not part of the story - it makes little to no sense ( unless you are filming an earthquake i guess )The cast ...They are not very good. But a big part of it is the forced and cheesy dialogue and the archetype characters to be portrait. Other than that - it is a prime example of choosing a bunch of beautiful people to play the roles of supersmart scientists. And not only that - but people with a dedication, a cause in life - even an obsession.You d have to go far to find such a bunch of people - meanwhile they do not act very scientific in their methods and procedures, not to mention how they tackle a problem. In that respect they act like moronic teenagers after some beers. I cannot make a fair judgement about the movie i guess, because it is one of the movies that makes me angry. The story could have been interesting ( not brilliant, because it is not a really original story anyway ) - had it not been for bad casting, bad writing - and a horrible, horrible camera.","As Above, So Below"
126,RomanJamesHoffman,A found-footage Indiana Jones which is possibly punching above its weight in the ideas department,6,11 June 2015,"""Found-footage? Pfft"" you may say. And yes, it's fashionable to dismiss found-footage films as passe and beneath uswe all do it. However, upon consideration this criticism doesn't really hold much water when scrutinised. Sure, the majority of found-footage movies are bad, but then this may have something to do with the terrible plots, poor scripting, and weak acting these movies exhibitaspects which arguably wouldn't have been redeemed by a more conventional cinematic approach. Conversely, movies which have a solid idea, are carefully scripted, and well-acted lose little from being done as found-footage and, in some instances, are better for it. Right, that prejudice dealt with, I have to say that 'As Above, So Below' isn't a fantastic movie. In fact, it's barely a scary moviehowever, it gives it everything it has and even where it doesn't quite cut it I found that I respected the movie for trying.The protagonist is a young archaeologist Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) who is continuing her father's work searching for the fabled Philosopher's Stone – a mythical item believed to possess the ability to transform lead into gold as well as confer immortality. Her quest takes her to Paris where she intends to descend into the infamous real-life Catacombs and to do so she and her colleague seek the help of a small troupe of aloof French types who know the labyrinthine tunnels well. They enter the catacombs and it doesn't take long before members of the group experience paranormal events like seeing long-dead friends or family and the events which killed them. Soon, they pass the point of no return and, in a desperate attempt to escape, descend deeper and deeper into darkness.The setting of the movie is genuinely macabre, and like 'The Descent' the simple fact of being in a series of underground tunnels immediately creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere which pushes the story along at a nice pace. However, while 'The Descent' is half group psychology story and half monster-living-underground story, 'As Above, So Below' is more consistent in that it soon becomes clear that what the group are experiencing are their own repressed fears and guilt which, in order to survive, they must confrontand being a horror movie, many don't. However, while the movie sets up the suspense well and executes some nice chills when they enter the Catacombs, the chills soon settle into temperate mildness and never really threatens to scare. In addition, the movie adds a mythological dimension to the plot in constantly referencing Dante's 'Inferno' which describes the various levels of Hellsomething which we are led to believe the group are inching ever closer to as they continue deeper; however, whether this is a literal Hell, a psycho-spiritual Hell, or both is left deliberately ambiguous at the ending.Horror movies are often treated as dumb. Something which I have always considered a criminal mis-representation as the best horror movies touch something deep within our psyches. In trying to inject some intelligence into the genre, I applaud the movie. However, crucially, while playing with some meaty ideas as the film plays itself out I began to feel that the emphasis on these mythological underpinnings detracted from the impact of the movieand what's more the lack of any substantial engagement with the themes meant that, by the end, the movie felt like a faux-intellectual exercise rather than a whistle-stop tour of the guilt-ridden reaches of our characters' souls.Still, 'As Above, So Below' is a decent watch due to some good acting, decent direction, and a great location which, like I say, even though the movie fails to achieve what it set out to do nonetheless deserves applause for attempting to be original.","As Above, So Below"

130,georgecoffeynewyorker,"Confusing Plot, Horribly done",1,29 August 2014,"Well, I must say I was most disappointed with the film. It was on my to see list. Meaning I was actually looking forward to it. Despite it being a horror genre, I had high hopes for it. However, we were treated to a history lesson(Pharaoh's in Egypt etc., ), which I didn't mind it. I don't mind learning history VISUALLY. However it was all garbish or as me ma would say Gibberish. Didn't understand a word of it. At the same time, it was also a horror film, in that we were treated to fare few scary scenes. My heart was pounding. When I was with me ex, I went through a period of loving horror and devil crap etc., However, I since have fallen out of love for it. With this particular horror, I actually expected the plot to be of similar to that say an alien comes to destroy the planet, everyone gets scared and they have to kill the alien to save humanity. Something along those lines. E.g World War Z. r Zombieland etc., etc., Bottomline is, the plot of As Above, So Below was as confusing as the next guy. From what I could gather, a reporter Scarlett(Weeks) and Benji(Hodge) are looking for some stone would ya believe it a Philosophers Stone(Which kinda makes you think, if the stone is either a real thing or a thing to do with Harry Potter series). Scarlett seeks the help from George(Papillon) which initially she refuses but eventually gets seeked in. He was to do some translation. Scarlett, George and Benji all encounter further guys. Scarlett was told to look for a Papillon(Civil) to help get into the catacombs so to get this special stone. Now when they get down, ""All Yee who Enter, Are doomed"". They get into a whole hep a baloni. However one thing that was most infuriating was that every time something bad was happening to the character, the audience would be laughing or whatever. Now normally in a film, if there is a character in a heap of baloni etc., etc., or being shot or having his throat sliced, it would actually be quite the OPPOSITE. The audience would be in total awww and OMG kinda thing. IMDb Forums reminded, me being claustrophobic. I felt like that throughout.","As Above, So Below"

The story line was really promising and it was delivered perfectly. It had great purpose and especially all those puzzles and riddles. The leading actress did a good job.

The team explores the Catacombs of Paris which then leads to the Gate of Hell and then kinda make their way back to human world. Plus a bit of treasure hunting and alchemist theories. Yet the plot cannot effectively put all these elements together. Neither is the visual effects stunning nor entertaining. So most of the time I can just see people running around. The whole movie really drags me even with the minimal sound effects.I give it 6 stars because of the story. It's a beautiful story if u read it as a novel.,"As Above, So Below"
133,Pistol219,Dantes inferno,10,23 July 2020,"Taking someone else's take by comparing to what modern day Dantes inferno is.

Beautiful and elegant Bomber style Actress.","As Above, So Below"
134,Pyro_Pizza,Highly Underrated,7,15 May 2021,"This film is critically underrated. It's a different type of horror that is more of a lowborn psychological thriller. It's not ripe with jumpscares or gore, it's smarter than that. It create genuinely spooky moments with visuals that are both thematic and just down right spooky. It does however not have a lot of character develop, and most of the survivors are fairly predicable, but if you let yourself be lost to the world of the story you'll have a good time watching this film.","As Above, So Below"
135,shannen-l-c,Eerie and memorable,8,16 April 2020,"As Above, So Below might just make it onto my favourite horrors of all time. Why? Because it achieved what so few are able to do - it genuinely scared me.The movie follows archaelogist and historical researcher, Scarlett, who is trying to locate the mystical Flamel Stone aka The Philosophers Stone. With the help of some friends, Scarlett delves into the Catacombs in Paris on a quest to find the stone. The plot is unique and runs consistently throughout. Although aspects of it are far-fetched, there's also a logic with which the plot is presented that makes it feel feasible and even believable.What makes As Above, So Below so great is the atmosphere. It's eerie, mysterious, suspenseful and at times terrifying. I'm generally not a huge fan of found-footage, but it's executed so well that I can't grumble at it. It serves the exact purpose that found-footage should and makes the viewer feel that they're part of the events rather than a mere by-stander. The plot pulls you in from the first few scenes, but it does take its time to build to suspense and intruige. Despite building up slowly, it's well paced, consistent throughout and has a satisfying pay-off. It's not scary in the typical sense, with only a few jump scares, but the jump-scares that it does have are effective and well-timed. The setting is really what contributes to the effectivness of the atmosphere - it's dark and claustrophobic, and nobody truly knows dwells in the depths of the earth. Underground caves are a particular sore spot to me as someone that is terrified of the idea of being trapped underground, having to crawl through tight spaces, swim under water in a cave where I may not be able to find the surface, never being able to find light or air again. The only other horror I've seen that uses this setting so well is The Descent.Surprisingly, the acting was brilliant and the characters likeable. This is a rarity in horror which is over-saturated with mediocre acting and one-dimensional characters. The cast all deliver great and believable performances, and the characters are interesting and actually have personality. I genuinely rooted for them and wanted them to survive.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed As Above, So Below. It ticks all of the boxes for me and does everything I'd expect a good horror movie to do, and a little extra. The plot is pretty original for a horror, it's atmospheric, has a strong cast and likeable characters and was actually scary.","As Above, So Below"
136,richkiel,Ultimately disappoints,5,24 July 2021,"This film suffers from all the problems that plague found footage films, notably the shaky camera, blurred images, and protagonists that spend about 90% of the time bickering, largely for no good reason.The religious meaning of the film is never explored in depth, a lot of nonsense happens in the film, and there is no real payoff in the end.I will give the film credit that it doesn't pull some cheap shot at the very end. But then again, there is no real sense of closure, and we don't get to experience the exhilaration of 'rebirth'.In the end, it all comes across as cheap, hurried, and superficial. With a proper re-write, the film could have been a lot better.","As Above, So Below"
137,daniele-iannarelli,"Not bad, not great, but hit the spot",5,10 March 2019,"Generally, I tend (try) not to watch anything with less than a 6.5 IMDB rating. However, on this occasion, I decided to give this 6.2 a go.I wasn't disappointed.The acting is actually quite good, script not bad, direction okay (although limited due to the subterranean catacombs setting) and the photography adequate. Although the film presented a reasonable interpretation/slant on the classic ""Dante's Inferno"", it was frustrating to be denied even an attempt at a final explanation for a satisfactory conclusion.You could argue that it spoke for itself in that the subjects eventually found redemption by turning their backs on Hell in forgiving themselves their lifetime follies. Nevertheless, at the end, some sort of insight into their post-inferno experience would have offered even a little resolution... perhaps as an 'epilogue'.Overall, though, despite some of the usual 'horror' clichéd jumps (some different than the usual, and quite clever) I didn't pick out anything near the number of ridiculous goofs and flaws that I did in both ""The Descent"" movies (especially the second one).I've no choice but to say... I actually really enjoyed this movie. Therefore, although I think it justifies a 5.5, I'm awarding a 5.0 (as usual when I can't award part-marks, I err on the full lower mark).","As Above, So Below"
138,VikiLauda,Just don't go BELOW!,6,24 February 2021,"I am not really a fan of the found footage genre, although I did enjoy the Blair Witch & the universally panned Appolo 18, yet when I saw it starred Perdita Weeks (Titanic series & the Tudors) I thought I would give this a go because I have enjoyed her work so far. Now I have been a horror fan all my life, but this movie is not really a ""horror"" in the classic sense, nor is it an action thriller, yet it is somewhere in between the two. It is not brilliant, but it is not bad either for something on a low budget. The story line is a bit messy, so unless you pay it your complete attention from start to finish, otherwise this watching expierence wont work. & I keep the DVD sutitles on so I dont miss mumbled dialogue. Also the ""found footage"" camera work is occasionally bizarre, very bad & headache inducing, as well the editing which was nothing short of whacky. However, this is a decent, entertaining movie, which is imaginative in it's execution. is paced well & does not try to be too ambitious. The acting is good & the whole thing was actually fimed on location in the Paris Catacoombs as opposed to a sound stage. This I believe adds a sense of realism. Having visited the Hell Fire Caves in Britain, I could really appreciate how the location filming for this felt very claustrophobic, creepy & mysterious. So as such I would not reccommend this movie to anyone who suffers from claustrophobia as this really comes across in the movie & adds to the tension. The character development is not brilliant which lets the movie down a bit & there were heaps of gaps in back stories & the ending is a bit of a dissapointment.Overall though this is not a bad little movie, just don't have high expectations if your going to watch this. Personally I would have liked to see more Hellish monster demons stalking our heros in the tunnels, but this is my preference as I love horror movies, but this movie has quite convinced me that if I ever find myself in Paris I will certainly do a tour of these awesome catacoombs!","As Above, So Below"
139,stephenlovelette,An Admirable Horror,7,30 August 2014,"Horror movies are rarely called 'great.'When was the last critically acclaimed horror movie released? You'd be hard-pressed to find anything since The Ring in 2002.I haven't seen The Conjuring, Mama or Oculus but people say they've got potential. I thought Drag Me to Hell was pretty good from 2009.But the last great one I caught in theaters was Devil from 2010.Which is also directed by John Dowdle. He wrote Quarantine (2008), as well – another solid semi- recent horror.As Above/So Below is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.First of all, it's shot on-location in Paris, which is a delight for any fan of that city. Favorite sights like Notre Dame and Sacre-Coeur are featured throughout.The filmmakers use almost every shooting style. AA/SB is a mockumentary about Scarlett (played by Perdita Weeks) a young archaeologist searching for the philosopher's stone. Therefore much of the footage is first-person, shot via headlamp GoPro cams.Although I'm sick of 'found footage' it works better here. For obvious reasons, the budget can't be massive, so this filmmaking style is particularly suited to horror.The story is also good, co-written by the director and his brother, Drew.There's more nuance than usual. The main characters use deductive reasoning and historical analysis in order to solve riddles and navigate the labyrinthine catacombs.There's a lot of rebirth imagery, but I wonder just how far the metaphor goes. Are the ribbed tunnels supposed to be reminiscent of a vaginal lining?Dichotomies drawn between light and dark, and up and down, are intriguing and thought provoking.The cast of unknowns delivers strong performances. It's tough to get through a whole scary movie without poor acting or cheesy moments.Apparently I'm in the minority because AA/SB is getting 13% amongst top critics and 57% amongst the users on Rotten Tomatoes.But I would encourage an open mind, because it's a cut above the rest.If you're looking for a decent flick this weekend, especially if you dig horror, you can do a lot worse than As Above/So Below.","As Above, So Below"
140,dutchchocolatecake,absolutely fantastic,10,14 September 2014,"First of all, I gotta say - if you don't like found footage movies, then don't go to this one. Because it baffles the life out of me why people go to movies they know they won't like, just so they can complain on the Internet about them later.I am a found footage fanatic, so of course the idea of this movie appealed to me. I went in with very low expectations as found footage movie sequencing seems to be repeating itself the last several years. Everything starts out innocently, things escalate, people don't 'get out' while they can, everyone starts dying, everyone eventually dies in sundry, shocking ways, the end.This movie doesn't do this. It is intense and active from the moment GO, with some scenes to catch your breath in between. I give it props for not following the same formula other found footage movies have, plus it has a deliciously original plot which is icing on the cake.The main character is a strong female protagonist, so she will not appeal to anyone who buys into bro culture. She is well educated, brave, knows martial arts, and can take care of herself. She flies in the face of every shaky-kneed horror heroine who was only cast to play the part of the victim. So there are a lot of people who are going to hate this movie because she's considered ""too brave,"" ""too smart,"" ""too capable"" to be realistic. Well, if you've got a low opinion of women to begin with, I suppose I can see how this movie can be offensive. LOLZ.Besides, part of her charm is that she if sees a sign that says ""don't enter"" and she goes in anyway like a ferret up a drain pipe. Awesome. Thank god we don't have yet another female character that plays by the rules. Now THAT is clichéd, but certainly not this movie.","As Above, So Below"
141,andreascaloni,Rally good,8,18 February 2021,"As Above, So below it's a well made found footage horror. It's a 93-minute survival-horror adventure set in the catacombs underneath Paris that are a literal ""Empire of Death"". It's creepy, with good performances and full of suspense. Some of the manifestations work very well to heighten the eerie atmosphere. Near the end of the movie there's a scene that i personally found exaggerated. However they take full advantage of all the elements that make the catacombs scary in real life.Rating: 8,2.","As Above, So Below"
142,fathersonholygore,As Above So Below is creepy & a solid offering from the found footage sub-genre,8,1 December 2014,"The found footage sub-genre of horror is an underrated form for several reasons. First, due to the amount and rate of such films coming out, and second being their quality. As Above, So Below works off interesting concepts, drawing from a little history, mostly historical fiction, to raise it above most of the found footage out there.Not only is the look of the film executed well, most if not all shots done hand-held style, but the subject matter is what really makes it a worthwhile horror. As Above, So Below is about a young doctor trying to carry on the work of her father, who took his own life after wasting it searching for the supposed Philosopher's Stone. The journey leads her, along with a man documenting her search and others, beneath the streets in the Catacombs of Paris.Of course everyone knows a film like this only ends one way. To an extent with this one it holds true; there is a body count, there are jump scares, even a creepy kid. However, it's how the filmmakers choose to get where they're going which is interesting. The ending is not one a lot of people see coming. I can almost guarantee a few people in the theatre left after the credits rolled wondering why they just invested an hour and a half of their time into a film like this solely because of the final few moments.Yet again though I say it's worth it because the visuals, in my opinion, were incredible. One of the elements of this story is alchemy, the title of the movie coming directly from a philosophical theory adopted by occultists and magicians, and the filmmakers use every chance they get to try and deepen some of the horror. The movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just spins a little better than most. There are some truly horrifying moments without being particularly gory, or relying on cheap scare tactics; though expect one or two. At times the claustrophobia will grab you by the throat and refuse to let go. Other times the tension of a psychological breakdown among a group of people burrowing further and further underground hoping to find a way out will make you squirm in your seat.In the minority judging by other reviews so far, I found As Above, So Below to be crafted well as a found footage film and also to be a genuinely creepy horror. For a horror movie to surpass a lot of the generic fodder being fed into theatres there has to be something unique; this one has got that special something. The filmmakers could have had these people camping in the woods, subtracted the strong female lead, killed more people, plus add a whole lot more screaming and unwatchable camera-work, but instead they chose to explore some interesting and intelligent characters in a way that will both scare you and surprise you.","As Above, So Below"
143,alexcomputerkid,"In the end, As Above, So Below could be described ""as Blair Witch in catacombs"" or a really messed up version of ""The Goonies"".",8,25 September 2014,"The idea of horror films being placed in one setting is not uncommon. The main idea of this is to put emphasis on the setting and to make for a claustrophobic film. The Blair Witch Project of 1999 or Evil Dead of 1981 involved settings in the woods and never left it once it was entered. In The Descent of 2005, the only setting was a cave. In Paranormal Activity of 2007, the setting was one house in San Diego. The list of horror films with a single setting could go on and on. As Above, So Below's director John Erick Dowdle is somebody who is very overlooked in the film world and is slowly turning into my favorite horror director around. His first film Poughkeepsie Tapes from 2007 never got a proper release through the theater and or on disk and can only be found on the internet but it got rave reviews from the few that did see it. Quarantine was a 2008 remake of a Spanish film that was set only in a apartment. In 2010, he puts out Devil which had a very interesting plot about a group of people trapped in an elevator with the devil being one of them. The film was so overlooked that the trilogy that was originally planned around it was cancelled. Now in 2014, his As Above, So Below is a horror movie following a very similar formula using claustrophobic ideas and the ""found-footage"" filmmaking technique. This is also kind of a Dowdle ""formula film"" but still, As Above, So Below is a very fun ride. The movie follow around Scarlet Marlowe (Perdita Weeks) a middle-aged woman who's father has committed suicide and who's on a quest to continue her father's goal of finding the Flamel stone which can grant everlasting life. After going down to the catacombs beneath Paris to search for the stone with a group of explorers, strange hauntings and happenings occur. From the above plot described, it would seem like this is a magical-type adventure filled with fantasy. Well yeah, you could say that would be true but barely because unlike most horror films, As Above, So Far Below is quite full of culture, including Parisian, European and even the Middle East. Being set in Paris, it's uses European ideas and obviously has a French vibe. Lead character, Scarlet gives off such a vibe of being smart that she comes off as being a scholar. Once we enter the catacombs, it is full of many horror ingredients and to say this would be different ending for a found footage film would be quite correct.Yes, it is silly for this to be a found-footage film because it really serves no purpose in the film. Even more problematic, these characters aren't very rich in substance and they are kind of all over the place but still the acting is far from a problem and just about everyone has a backstory which isn't necessarily common in these type of plots. The catacombs idea is quite original and brings a different vibe to the film but it becomes even more interesting once the film puts psychological and also metaphysical ideas on top of it. It's not the type of horror film that is going to outright scare you but at least you are going to be creeped out by the concept and for crying out loud, it is shot in the real catacombs of Paris which contain the remains of 6 million dead people!In the end, As Above, So Below could be described ""as Blair Witch in catacombs"" or a really messed up version of ""The Goonies"". Anyway, As Above, So Far Below is an innovative shock to the horror genre in 2014. A film that literally came out of nowhere for me.","As Above, So Below"
144,azeemnavarro,Wasted idea,2,25 July 2019,"John Erick Dowdle, after a meh debut with Poughkeepsie Tapes, and the very disappointing follow ups that were the sh1tty Rec remake and the mediocre Devil, he proceded to make this film. And again, he didn't made a good film. This had so much potential that is sad how this ended.
This is based on Dante's Inferno, yeah, i'm not joking, a found footage flick is made up from one of the most important pieces of literature. And the premise itself of the movie is interesting. We follow a group of people, lead by a female alchemist scholar, that search for the philosofer's stone in the catacombs of Paris. It sounds dumb, but if you consider the ""source material"" and a enviroment we have never seen in a movie before, this could have been great. It's not because our characters are badly acted and uninteresting, we don't care about them, they make the stupidest decisions possible. And of course, this being a found footage movie, has to have no tension, and the only way that tries to scare you is by jumpscares, and very bad ones. The sound mixing and editing is horrible, the effects are awful, the dialogue is beyond nonsensical.
Ugh, this was very irritating. The 2/10 rating is only because the movie adaptates well the themes of the nine circles of hell, wich is kinda surprising considering how bad everything else. Hope the guy makes something decent, because I can tell he has some talent.","As Above, So Below"
145,daryopeek,A fun Indiana Jones-esque found footage horror,8,14 April 2019,"As Above So Below never been credited as one of the better horror movies in the highly competitive found footage horror industry. The problem lies in many aspects; the acting, the screenplay, and ultimately the logic. However, during my first time watching this movie, it was an enjoyable experience, similar to REC, which the American remake also directed by the writer/director of this movie. As a disclaimer, this review is written after my second watching.Scarlett is an ambitious alchemist/archeologist that venture the world to seek the existence of the philosopher's stone after her father's suicide. After she found a clue in Iran, she, her ex-boyfriend George, and her cameraman Benji, along with a group who knows the underground of Paris, seek a journey of darkness and terror in the hidden passages of catacombs below Paris.While my initial response after the first time watching this movie was ""Terrific"", my second attempt proves that this movie is not quite as stellar as my memory remembers. This movie highly inspired by historical adventure plot that quite recycled in many elements, it's not a flaw, but I am surprised how this movie can be so predictable in terms of the plot. Although, I must say some of the jumpscares and the hallowing experience the group's having during their walk is creepy. The claustrophobic nuance is translated well by the found footage, something that can't be easily replicated (for example Levasseur's The Pyramid). And for I must say, while the jumpscares are not as much as you may expect in this kind of genre, the setting has its ways to help the lack of the ghost/scary things.What's the strongest point from this movie is the historical aspect from the plot that takes many real places/references that incorporated well, so that even though the logic isn't that good, the movie manages to be relatable, like how you experience Turteltaub's National Treasure. Even though, I have to admit how the screenplay builds Scarlett's character is quite annoying and feels unearthly and not original at all. I think having more a group's full of philosopher's stone's nerds explores the catacomb foolishly would be more fun rather than having some professionals risk their life too much without any rationale.As Above So Below has many things that able to be explored to be scarier, but they throw it without any notion after the second half (the girl following the group at the bar, the underground cult). Somehow it disintegrates the flow of the movie because they have enough material (like each of the group's members personal guilt) that already told. So why bother to add more unfinished/unexplained things in the first place?Nevertheless, As Above So Below is one of good experience to have in a found footage horror film that for most of the time, unable to give anything new other than being cheap. I am glad I watch this again, at least to confirm that although many reviewers underline the flaws too much, I find this movie an enjoyment that everyone should have without digest it seriously.","As Above, So Below"
146,taraangel-40960,Not a great movie..,3,23 January 2020,"The movie was pretty bad, but then I kind of expected it to be. I watched it because it was actually filmed in the catacombs under Paris (Catacombes of Paris, Paris, France). You aren't able to see a lot of this area, even on a tour, but I'd heard about the movie in a show about the catacombs. Not a great movie, I wouldn't even say a good one, but I got what I wanted to see. Though it was bad enough that I won't be watching it again :) The 3 I gave it is actually for the location, not the quality of the 'movie'. That gets a 'no thanks'.","As Above, So Below"

This viewer has struggled through plenty of found footage over the years and found myself consistently left frustrated. AASB fills the gaps in its faults with a terrific atmosphere and rarer approach to supernatural horror. It mirrors Dante's Inferno and so what could be meaningless has some symbolism at play that isn't beaten over your head with.It's not Ingmar Bergman layered but it fits the tone of the story and plays into the whole Uncharted/Lara Croft adventure thing. Weird old artifacts, a confident and comically qualified protagonist (4 degrees...?) Sure, the characters are more undefined composites, but that's no unheard of pitfall in horror.But the movie is more the setting than the personalities. It's scary in how loopy their surroundings get and not more so the overblown audio-visual, even if it's not all overdone.

If they had just stuck to a horror version of National Treasure without the cameras constantly shaking, blinking on and off, etc. I would have given this movie 3 more stars.

The movie did get ok when it felt like National Treasure (2004), when the guy was fixing the tower bell and clues were being discovered. I also kinda liked the themes concerning the whole search for the treasure. The French guy is somewhat entertaining to watch. There was this also super creepy girl that got a decent scare.

153,j-madej,"""As above so below"" is recommended to the fans of found footage genre, but I reckon average movie goer might be entertained by it as well.",7,7 September 2014,"The greatest horror movies have deep-rooted mythology about them. The best of them like ""The Exorcist"" or the ""Rosemary's Baby"" have a depth that goes far beyond the obvious story. This is why they become classics of its genre that later inspire other filmmakers to create a similar type of movies. Each sub-genre has it's precursor that started it all. In terms of found footage horror genre, that precursor was ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) which with very good marketing strategy became a huge cult classic in its own way. Another movie that created very successful franchise is Oren Peli's original ""Paranormal Activity"" (2009) movie that started all the ""hunted in the house"" angle of storytelling which was filmed for about $60.000 with cameras and what looked like CCTV footage that brought 197 million dollars world wide. In fact I've met Oren at the Temecula Valley Film and Music Festival in California where he was recipient of the ""Maverick of the Year Award"". Very nice humble guy who moved from directing on to producing in his extensive filmmaking career. To some extant ""As above so below"" brings breath of fresh air in to this over crowded genre. To produce this type of movies you don't need a huge amount of money and therefor most of film students as well as beginning filmmakers often opt to try to create this type of found footage inspired movies. Whether they are successful or not depends often on the story and the acting of the actors playing the characters. If their acting is not believable or story does not glue well what we as the audience have to look forward to is about 80 minutes of movie that we are not engaged in. Rarely now we have horror movies that are truly thought out, casted and developed well that create the unforgettable trill that creeps in on us through our subconscious. You can now include ""As above so below"" in to the category of horror movies that succeeded at that and then some. ""When a team of explores ventures into the catacombs that lie beneath the streets of Paris, they uncover the dark secret that lies within this city of the dead.""Idea of using Paris catacombs as the location where 6 million dead are buried is quite genius one. I am surprised that no one thought about this before. The combination of a real historical location with this type of movie is a match made in heaven or should I say in hell as in this case appears. The whole set up of the story and the introduction of the characters is done really well which is necessary for the overall success of the movie. We need to care about them when eventually they are being murdered one by one as the movie progresses. There is a lot of archaeological and occult depth in the story and there are moments that remind us of ""Indiana Jones"" as well as the game ""Tomb Raider"" when main characters are trying to solve clues to find a philosopher stone hidden in unopened to public areas of the catacombs. The acting is very solid which adds to the believability of the film. Most cameras are placed on the heads of the actors or so it appears, letting us the audience see what they see which creates a high state of tension. They are few creepy moments where what you see and hear or should I say what you think you saw based on rapid camera moves enhances the heightened state of anticipation.

It's always been something that I have a hard time watching because you can't focus on what's actually going on. I think maybe that's part of the appeal from a filmmaker standpoint, especially with lower budget films. When this started I groaned a bit and thought, here we go another one of these. I mentally began to prepare myself for another one of those films. I'm happy to say that wasn't the case and I liked this one quite a bit. While I didn't find it scary per say it was an interesting story. There's actually a good reason for it being shot the way it is and I thought the acting was fairly solid. The pacing is good. I never once found myself getting bored. I was glued to what was going on. This had a very claustrophobic feel to it. In many ways, it reminded me of the movie The Cave, only done way better.

162,koen_smit,Overall good enough to watch and enjoy.,7,5 August 2016,"Found footage horror, I'm not a fan. If well done I'm only slightly irritated by not seeing clearly what is happening and I can enjoy enough and if badly done, I want to throw anything towards the screen that is close at hand and need to put a bucket in front of the couch for my husband to throw up in (I don't take the risk of watching them in the cinema). So I tend to skip this genre most of the time. Luckily my curiosity took over with this one, especially because I've seen Perdita Weeks in Penny Dreadful and I liked her (short) appearance in that series a lot. And I was not disappointed. Yes, it's not the best horror film in the list and the director and producer clearly watched The Descent (one of my all time favorites) many times, but I accept that as horror movies are known to 'borrow' scenes from their greatest predecessors. It's a slow burn with enough tension built up towards the ending to give you some true scares. (I've never seen my cat run out of the house so fast after we shouted and jumped when the woman appeared just before Benji 'fell' down the pit).What made it not a great movie was the lack of personality development for the cast apart from the lead actress. Some had some more than others, but overall, it didn't really matter who died because you weren't really loving anyone that much. The acting was good, they could have added some more layers to the characters. Further more, the whole stone-search story-line was totally off for me. It worked and then it didn't, so she ran back, climbed up, fell in a pool of blood (Descent-style) and discovered the true stone. Even though this is fiction, I didn't buy it. The rest of the movie I did, this one not. And what I thought was really a missed chance is that they enter the gates of hell like Dante's Inferno (they do show that map) and I really hoped that when they came out up-side-down it would have been in Paris the Hell-on-earth version. So a burning Eiffel tower, thousands of bodies floating in a blood-red Seine, demons ripping people apart time after time... That would have been a great anti-climax. I love it when people think they survived and then discover they didn't, but that's a choice. So apart from this, the acting is solid, the setting is amazing, the moving camera wasn't bothering me that much and I jumped several times (ain't that why we watch horror anyway). I enjoyed watching it and I think I'm gonna keep an eye out for Perdita Weeks' movies.","As Above, So Below"

166,thedukeofmovietown,Offers much more than the trailer would lead you to believe.,7,14 September 2014,"In the spirit of the season shift, I ran out and caught AS ABOVE SO BELOW yesterday. The found footage style movie is penned and directed by the infamous Dowdle brothers John and Drew who brought you films like Quarantine The Poughkeepsie Tapes and the M. Night Shamalamadingdong produced Devil. Although you might be ready to check out right now, I'll ask you to hold on for just another minute. The flick centers itself around a young Indiana Jones-like archaeologist, played by Perdita Weeks, who is on a quest to follow in her father's footsteps and find the Philosopher's Stone of alchemy legend which she believes to be buried deep within the famous Catacombs of Paris. Her quest brings her to enlist the help of a crew of French guides, her ex-partner and a videographer as she ventures deep within the unreached regions of the largest mass grave in the world. The adventurers get more than they bargained for however, as their search for the supernatural object brings them in contact with supernatural forces that none of them expected.Despite what the trailers would have you believe, this movie is actually more of a mixture of the adventure and horror genres rather than a straight up, predictable horror flick which gives it a little bit of a different flavor than traditional scary movie fare. Have no doubt though, there are more than a few scary moments here and the overall freehand shaky-cam style of the film cranks up the claustrophobia and the tension to 11. That being said, the movie doesn't cheap out in the same way that so many other found footage films have in the past and it's actually quite refreshing to see a movie like this that actually knows what it wants to do. It's well put together, there are decent special effects and although it's lacking on sufficient character development, the actors do a decent job of acting and it stays tight and interesting throughout.I have to say that before walking into this movie my expectations were really low, but over the course of 90 minutes it really made a believer out of me.

In that note it does offer a nice and steady variety of strange imagery and odd events to keep me entertained. The performance delivered by the actors was acceptable and believable. The story was a bit lacking, seeming to exist only as an engine to move the characters from one scary moment to another. My biggest complaint with the film is that it ultimately falls victim to a slew of over used horror clichés such as pop up scares that are visible a mile away (dear Hollywood: Ear blastingly loud noises after a moment of silence and shoving a screaming face into the camera is not scary) as well as quite a few moments of forehead slapping in response to character choices. There were only a few moments in which the movie made the typical found footage mistakes of shaking the camera wildly or thumbing the mic so that aspect of the film was passable.

A group of 20-somethings go spelunking in caves and get spoked. Nothing too attractive for me. I was on a horror movie website (at work) and an article came up about the film. (Unfortunately, I can't remember what site, otherwise, I would link the article here) I'm just gonna say to service this review the article I read was from Bloody Disgusting. I didn't want to go through the article because I didn't want to get spoiled. But this article had me rethinking my first thought of the film. And finding out that it was R Rated, I jumped online to give it a watch.As Above So Below shot found footage style by director John Erick Dowdle, follows Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) as she and a group of people venture into the catacombs in Paris looking for a specific artifact and treasure. What they come upon is something far more dangerous and dark. That's all I want to say about this plot because this film is best enjoyed cold. Don't read anything if you plan on seeing this. And definitely, do not watch the trailer. I'm so glad that I totally forgot about the film when I started watching it. It made the experience more enjoyable that way. Scarlett is joined on this expedition by a language expert George (Superstore's Ben Feldman), cameraman Benji (Cougar Town's Edwin Hodge) and a group of Parisian explorers.If there was a horror version of Tomb Raider this is it. Scarlett's drive to find this artifact is because of a death in the family. Her traits, looks, and storyline are very much on the same par with a one miss Lara Croft. She doesn't carry guns or fight of dozen of armed gunmen. The film also has an element of Indiana Jones. There are puzzles, riddles, and clues that the team need to decipher to get to their final destination. But let me tell you, none of them including me, did not see where this film was going. I can say that is a benefit of good filmmaking and decent storytelling.We are only given information through dialogue. If you don't pick up on something when it's said you might be confused further down the line. Key plot elements that maybe come back later are all revealed through the characters. The film has layers literal and figurative. And when it gets dark, it gets very dark. The performances help with sucking the viewer into the story. Perdita Weeks is the standout, feeling very much like a parallel to Lara Croft. When things happen you feel for her and she is not weak. The entire film for each character runs the gamut of emotions. There were times I was on the edge of my seat and times I was yelling at the screen.Sound design is key to a film like this. It's done well here. The filmmakers have made it so you feel lost and claustrophobic. There is no music other than music coming from the situation the group is in. Thankfully, John Erick Dowdle knows how to build tension. He doesn't place jump scare after jump scare. When they come they are well worth the wait. I will not lie, there were two of those moments that got me. One got me really good. Touche.My only issue is there is so much going on storywise, you don't really understand it all by the end of the film. Things happen in the story to certain characters because of certain things that happened in their past. We aren't explained that much. I don't want over explanation but I'd like a little more detail to fill in the characters as more three dimensional. For an adventure thriller with some horror, As Above So Below is a decent ride as a Lara Croft movie without the real Lara Croft. But for fans of layered films in their horror with some nice jump scares this is a good watch.","As Above, So Below"
171,corytrevorson,"Like Tomb Raider, but even worse.",1,19 September 2018,"It takes all it's cues from Tomb Raider, which was a stupid movie to begin with. British accent girl? Check! Girl knows martial arts? Check! Girl's dad is dead? Check! Other people tongue and cheek about how she gets them into trouble? Check! Awful dialogue and acting? Check!........That's not all though! The ""creators"" decided to make it exponentially worse by putting it in a found footage format.

172,artdonovandesign,Great Supernatural Horror! Truly haunting.,8,24 February 2021,"Once the film gets through the mandatory introductions and the main character's machismo and ridiculous personal credentials, (she's far too young to have achieved even half of what's on her C.V.), this film moves very swiftly into a truly horrifying supernatural/action adventure.""As Above So Below"" (great title!) really begins when the team enters the catacomb caves deep under the streets of Paris. Many really scary vignettes all the while the team moves deeper into the tunnels, getting more lost with each turn.This is truly one of the very best of the ""Blaire Which"" style, live ""Go Pro"" scare fests. You WILL remember many of the parts in this film as a truly haunting adventure.","As Above, So Below"

174,Necroambulant,Almost Deserves 9 Stars Rather Than 8,8,30 May 2015,"As Above, So Below is the found footage horror genre's answer to The Da Vinci Code and Indiana Jones...though it falls somewhere in between as far as quality is concerned, being not as good as the Indiana Jones movies but quite a great deal better than The Da Vinci Code.An extremely well-educated (though perhaps too impulsive) woman follows a series of clues from Iran to Paris in search of the alchemical Philosopher's Stone. The search leads her into the catacombs beneath Paris and much deeper, into a nightmarish place where things steadily fall further and further out of control.All said, it was one of the best found footage flicks I have seen. It wasn't entirely predictable (which was a nice touch), the acting was better than the standard quality from this sort of movie, and the story was actually quite interesting.","As Above, So Below"
175,beezar-66805,The Amateur Hour,2,11 July 2020,"Seriously bad. Poor acting, bad actors, pathetic accents, laughable script, props from a Goodwill store and a cardboard cave. More plot holes than a large colander. It's so bad I was hoping they'd all die 15 minutes into this pretentious cow-patty flop.High scores must be from parents, friends, and Mrs. Felcher's 5th grade drama class where the actors learned their skills and never progressed from that point.I hope the 'actors' kept their days jobs at the car wash and 7-11. One day this will be a Rifftrax special like Manos.","As Above, So Below"
176,j_walking1516,"Eh, Lazy and Cliché",5,19 February 2015,"Great concept but awful execution. ""Found Footage"" are most always crap from the get go, this is one of the better ones but it is still a found footage. The story, the atmosphere, and the general spookiness all suffer because you're not allowed to focus on anything. Every time something would start to get really interesting the camera would either start malfunctioning or just start spinning wildly. Found footage, imo, are the laziest form of film making ever made.That being said, what you could actually see was pretty good. the concepts of Hell were pretty exciting and creative but could have been a lot more if you could actually see anything for more than 2 seconds.It was claustrophobic but could have been a lot more so (Crawl or Die is the most claustrophobic movie ever made and this is nowhere near that level). The storyline of everyone having their own personal hell and personal demons was very cliché but it was presented well enough for going that route.At the end of the day I'd say this was a little better than average. Better than most mainstream horrors like the freaking Conjuring and Annabel and Sinister and all those garbage atrocities (the popular crap that is ruining the horror genre).I've seen a lot worse than this but I've seen a lot better. I doubt I'll ever feel a desire to watch it again except for maybe a few reference scenes.I'm saying a 4, it just could have been so much more if they weren't so lazy and afraid to push the boundaries.","As Above, So Below"
177,michael-sengwah,It Leaves Audiences with a lot of Unanswered Questions,6,5 September 2014,"It has a big potential to venture deep into archaeology and mythology but the initial intention of both Universal/ Legendary to follow the success of Paranormal Activity franchise through found-footage cinematography style has ruined overall, the second half of the film. The film starts decently at first, thrills audiences to follow the adventure into a secret under tunnel grave but soon after that, it losses both its way whether to focus entirely as horror, adventure or fantasy film and the logics especially towards the ending. While it is undeniable that it manages to create creepy tones to generate scares sporadically, the performance of the casts are moderately fine, the visual effects are stunning but sadly it suffers from an uninspired plot that makes all of the uncertainties about the tomb left unanswered.","As Above, So Below"
178,cbak223,Loved it... But...,7,7 December 2014,"As titled, I did love this film. Who doesn't like a good horror film that has the elements of ""todays"" film making, meaning the camera work being the first person view, like V/H/S, early Blair Witch, etc. This story is perfect for this type of film making, letting you feel as if your there with them. The History of the Catacombs is one of horror and great history for the U.K. Never having been to Paris, I would love to visit one day. This film starts out right out of the gate as the lead actress is a daredevil of an archaeologist, trying to follow in her fathers footsteps. Soon discovering a key that will essentially lead her to ""The Holy Grail"" or how best to cheat death. She soon has her findings pointing her to an undiscovered tunnel in the catacombs, with an ex-boyfriend,a friend, and 3 ""catafyles""(people that guide you illegally though the catacombs) in tow they set out to discover what is buried for good reason. I do give this film from the writing, directing, and even technical aspect of it an 8/10, I just wish the end had been a little more believable. John Dowdle did a good job, and the actors were decent as well, lead actress Perdita Weeks was fierce and engaging to keep you glued to the screen, so I definitely recommend this film.","As Above, So Below"
179,madsmartinussen,"Smart, but dumb",6,28 July 2021,"This would be a 7, perhaps even an 8, were it not for that dangerously moronic plot element, in which the ancient Aramaic text is translated into a perfectly rhyming modern day English poem. As if this wasn't enough, throughout the film they keep revisiting this, reminding us how incredibly stupid it is! I never look for realism in my horror films, and as such I mostly miss the plot holes, which is fine cause I don't care, but this one was just too huge to ignore, and the worst thing is; I don't believe it's a mistake! I'm positive the director knew well enough how dumb it was, but chose to leave it in, presumably justifying it along the lines of ""teens don't notice that kinda thing"", and as such, it's disrespectful and insulting to the intelligence of every viewer.On to the good parts:I love the whole Tomb Raider element to the lead character and the story, the exploring and deciphering ancient codes is kinda unique and works great (except, well you know..) as the foundation for a horror film. It kept me entertained during the not-too-scary parts, in fact the movie has a lot more going story-wise than most modern horror flicks. I love found footage horror, and this is a very original outing in the genre. I also like the Hell theme, most my favorite horror films have that element to them. I'm a devout atheist, but religious or not, the notion of hell can be made terrifying when used right. Great examples of this would be Event Horizon and Baskin, and this film does a quite good job in invoking the same kind of supernatural terror. Last but definitely not least, it's pretty darn scary!All of this brings me back to why I don't believe the poem is a mistake. The rest of the movie is too good. It's obviously made by intelligent individuals, they just happened to be a bit too arrogant, and left the thing in thinking nobody would notice. I did a little digging, and newsflash, EVERYONE noticed. A little more respect for your audience, and I'd have given this (I decided) 8 stars instead of 6, and I'm sure a lot of other people would have as well.","As Above, So Below"
180,joeywyss,Another Nail in the Coffin of American Horror Movies,5,15 January 2015,"Yet another waste wrapped in the ""Found Footage"" gimmick playbook. It's all here, gotcha scares you can see coming a mile away, mysterious figures walking past doorways in the background, clumsy ad lib and exposition, the come to Jesus speech to camera as you wait to die, and worst of all, the ridiculous camera footage being 'captured' while monsters/demons/killers/witches or whatever are trying to kill you. Here it's even worse because the footage of cameras that are clearly dropped and left behind still end up in the final product. They aren't even sticking to the Blair Witch playbook. It has an interesting premise, but of course is saddled with a weak limp script. It has an adequate cast that can do more than spell acting, but unfortunately they are also collared by same vapid scripting. The required abundant poor decisions are here to drive the script (seriously, your friend who disappeared in the catacombs long ago mysteriously appears to lead you out? Why follow him when HE couldn't get out?). A fleshed out script for an interesting plot performed by a competent cast would have made this a pretty good movie. That's the biggest shame here, a good idea and good casting were completely squandered to fit the new budget model. And yet they can't figure out why box office is down.","As Above, So Below"

183,klheintz,Better than most found footage films,5,12 December 2016,"I went into this film expecting it to be nothing special and it really isn't. It follows a simple premise that reminds me of the new Tomb Raider game in many ways. From the story, to the characters, to the locations and even the voice of the leading lady remind me of Tomb Raider. Which isn't necessarily bad but it feels unoriginal in that regard.I do love the catacombs setting though. The tight confines and feelings of claustrophobia is always great in horror films. I feel that some of that feeling is lost with the found footage style of filming but it still has the basics to make you feel uncomfortable.One thing I was pleasantly surprised with was the acting overall. Like seriously it was so much better than most of the other films in this style of film and it was nice. Obviously not all of the characters were going to be great but Scarlett, George, and Benji where great and they save any of the weaker performances.Overall I think it was a well acted found footage film that feels a lot like a video game in ways that aren't bad. I give it a 5 because, while it may be one of the better found footage films I've seen, it doesn't get rid of the fact that there's still many other films with a better story and even better execution.","As Above, So Below"
184,specialuse117,Descent into boredom,2,23 November 2014,"Wanted to like this film, found footage is growing on me. But there need to be some semblance of reality, not banal disbelief. Tries too hard to make the characters likable and hip. Guy breaks into churches to repair ancient clocks, young ""ph.D"" solves riddles in seconds that have puzzled scholars for centuries, tunnel leader sees other tunnel rat that has been missing mysteriously for years and has no reaction, and so on. Take out the misused supernatural crap and it could have been entertaining. At the same time the story goes nowhere and everywhere. Really a bad film that tries too much and succeeds at nothing. How can a director make the Paris catacombs boring.","As Above, So Below"

188,kdycer,Massive bore of a film,4,21 April 2020,"Touted as a horror film but it's not at all scary, it's just silly characters running around screaming whilst covered in dust. And blood.

Not that that's a great loss.","As Above, So Below"
189,theflixerdotcom,I guess you had to be there...,4,23 November 2014,"Today, I'm going to do a quick review of As Above, So Below. This one was yet another found footagesque type horror film with a relatively low budget and a mainly unknown, but familiar cast.This movie didn't really work for me. I found it to be a little boring and the story seemed familiar, much of it seemed to be kind of recycled from The Descent and of course the Blair Witch Project. Some of the supernatural elements were interesting, but in this case the feeling I got was that I had to be there to really know how scary it was.For some reason, watching this, I wasn't nearly as terrified as the people in the movie were. It felt like the camcorder style it was filmed in kind of dulled the edge. It likely would have been better to make this just as a movie rather than a found footage film. I also found it almost too well lit in most parts...the lighting was a little too bright which kind of removed some of the ominous feel.Not to mention the mostly not scary antagonists. Lots of noise and horror elements we've seen before thrown in here and some pretty weak bad guys make for some yawns unfortunately.The ending was way to tidy as well. I really hate predictable endings in an already fairly predictable genre. Someone needs to come along and shake this style of movie up, or just get rid of it. I know this won't happen though because these movies basically print money because they are so cheap to make.In the end, this movie came a little too late into the genre and the story felt a little hokey to me...like I said earlier, I guess you had to be there.","As Above, So Below"
190,blatherskitenoir,Interesting,6,28 August 2014,"6.5 stars. Better than average with some points of interest, but not amazing. I am going to classify As Above, So Below as a psychological thriller, rather than a horror film. There are some minor horror elements, but the main movement of the plot runs on a claustrophobic adventure through twisted tunnels. The characters must deal with their fears of dying, being trapped forever, and in surviving whatever new psychological terror is going to present itself as the catacombs grow more convoluted the deeper into the earth they go. The film is of philosophical and symbolic interest. There is a very interesting mix of alchemy, Dante, and kabbalistic zen being presented. Those familiar with Dante's Inferno will have fun pointing out the references and some background knowledge of alchemy will also increase the enjoyment of this film. As Above, So Below is Dante's Inferno mixed with The Decent to create a modern, moral bildungsroman.","As Above, So Below"
191,Ghost33,"This one is different, in a good way.",8,19 June 2017,"If you're into horror movies, you already know that a modern, moderately unknown horror movie receiving over a 6 on IMDb is a good sign. As usual, with the films I like, I think it deserves better.This movie is different than others in this genre. It's well done and the subject matter is perfect for a horror movie. Oh sure, there's things you can pick apart if you're into dissecting every plot hole or unbelievable character action. But if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, I guarantee you'll find a movie that surpasses many in this genre in sheer plot alone. The acting is good and the movie builds and builds to a satisfying ending.I've re-watched it over three times. Half the horror movies nowadays, I turn off in 10 minutes.8/10","As Above, So Below"
192,film316-125-427677,The Decent goes to Hell,8,6 October 2014,"As Above, So Below is a new documentary style horror film from the man behind The Devil (As in the film not as in the ruler of hell), this time we are descending down under Paris, so I suppose the reel question is, will this horror belong in Quarantine or on V/H/S?Ah Paris, the city of love, and of death it seems, is the new hand held horror to be trusted. Apparently under Paris there is the catacomb which is the biggest single grave in the world. As soon as the film starts the overall surreal and creepy nature begins. The opening of the movie shows a woman trying to uncover quite literally a golden calf, but something isn't quite right even at this early stage, John Erick Dowdle begins to sow seeds of discomfort for us.That's As Above, So Below's true power the film keeps you on edge for the entire duration, in truth there probably is only around 20 minutes of horror in the 90 minute movie, but you never know when those moments are going to strike, they come in seconds of pure terror or flurries of violence and horror. Both styles are beautiful and elegantly executed, at its strongest points As Above, So Below reminded me of Silent Hill, in the fragments at the start when ANYTHING could and does happen and you are on the very edge of your seat, and then Sean Bean turns up.As Above, So Below isn't as generous as Silent Hill, it doesn't give us an outlet or a rest. The entire picture from start to finish is designed to scare us. To make us sweat out our fears and we do. As Above, So Below is a horror in the most fundamental way, it is a film which sets out to scare us, everything in it works to that one idea. Fear. As Above, So Below works because it starts to feel less like a film and more like an endurance test, as soon as the team enter the catacombs; you know bad things are going to happen. As Above, So Below has an elephant in the room and it is call ""justification"". All films have this, but documentary horror films have it the hardest because they have to (on some level) explain away why everyone is holding cameras and for what purpose. As Above, So Below takes the Blair Witch option and just says someone is making a documentary. The actual plot of As Above, So below is probably it's weakest feature. We follow the quest of a young British archaeologist (Scarlett) as she searches for (And I'm not making this up) The Philosophers Stone, which legends has it holds the secrets to alchemy. That's a dumb plot but to counterbalance this As Above, So Below takes it's time to build it's characters properly. I truly cared about what happened to the people in front of me in As Above, So Below and that's one of the highest compliments you can give any horror movie really.Tension, in a single descibes As Above, So Below. A film that doesn't need to explain itself because it's just too scary to, by far one of the best horrors I have ever seen.","As Above, So Below"
193,k_rae_rae,Almost gave up on this,3,1 May 2021,"Literally nothing happens for the first 40 minutes of this movie. I really did not think I was going to make it through, such a snooze fest.

The ending wasn't too great either. Definitely not scary at all.","As Above, So Below"
194,Dr_Snickerstein,Decent horror movie,6,8 September 2020,"I caught this on Netflix the other night. I've heard about this before in the media. It peaked my interest, but I never thought or felt the need to seek it that is until last night fate had sealed the deal.I went in with no expectations other than the short vague review from other viewers recommending to watch it and that it's a documentary style movie.Well, needless to say I was pretty entertained and horror is my favorite genre. I love to get scared. Horror movies do not scare me much so I seek that to get my fill. It has some jump scares and considering how this was really filmed inside the catacombs of France, that's a scary concept. There's a deep history to that.The movie models itself over Dante's Inferno and I never realized that until the end.I would recommend this movie for any fans of horror. View it again during October just to feel festive. This is the type of movie you can watch on any Halloween season.","As Above, So Below"
195,VolYotenbane,Surprised no one has talked more about the ending....,10,15 July 2016,"FYI: This review contains spoilers! This movie was brilliant, especially coming from the standpoint of a history/symbolism/alchemy nerd. For a little background, Hermes Trismegistus originally invented the phrase ""As Above So Below"" as the key to magic and the ancient mysteries...back when medieval alchemy was taken very seriously and acted as bridge between the divine and science. The phrase basically means that the divine is within us: just as our atoms are formed, the universe is formed. Just as the heavens and cosmos function, our bodies function. We are not separate from the divine. Our intent is powerful enough to impact our external environment. This fact is being touched upon so far by neurology, psychology, etc., and is seeing a revival in Neopaganism.That being said, this movie alludes to this alchemical ancient knowledge on so many levels....especially the ending. When Scarlett realizes she has to put the philosopher's stone back, she sees herself in the mirror and realizes that SHE IS the philosopher's stone...perhaps she has had the latent power all along! And that is the real key and mystery to alchemy. It is not just transforming metal into gold....it is refining your own soul to be able to use your full intent and potential. Many more contemporary wise people have taught us this amazing fact...such as Carl Jung. The divine we have inside impacts what happens in our external environments. As Scarlett repeated in the film, ""The world is as you believe it to be.""","As Above, So Below"
196,sammie_sambal,Taking An Action Cam Into Hell,7,26 February 2016,"Yes, it has the shaky hand-held camera, but if you're fine with that then you'll be treated to a suspenseful horror movie with above average acting in an ominous underground setting with plenty claustrophobic tunnels and chambers, disturbing mind-games, and plenty of (jump) scares. I especially liked the a-trip-down-to-hell-via-the-backdoor theme. I just wished they had done a little bit more with it, like at the end. Hell should've been a mirror image of our world as well, just like the catacombs. To sum it up 'As Above, So Below' is like; what if Lara Croft had a GoPro? If you've always wondered about that go see this movie.","As Above, So Below"
197,superkt,I'm thoroughly spooked and have a lot of opinions now,8,24 June 2020,"To begin, this film plays on two of my (and plenty other's) biggest fears - enclosed, tight spaces and the dark. I get very anxious in the dark so combing all this with the first person style, yep, you got me. The movie has been over for about 10 minutes now and my chest is still tight.I don't watch many found footage style movies and the few I have seen were underwhelming. However, this one just works. I went in knowing nothing but the name (didn't even read the description on Netflix) so I had no idea what to expect. You're thrown into the catacombs with them, not just watching what happens from the sidelines but now you're part of their adventure.The whole premise of film is drafted well enough and told effectively - it's like Indiana Jones meets The Descent via Blair Witch to solve the Di Vinci Code. It's not some crazy original never been done before plot though. I give the actors props. We see a lot of close up faces and those faces look convincingly terrified.The first 20 minutes or so I was only half paying attention. Listening to the two of them directly translate some ancient languages to find hidden treasure was kind of laughable. Then they manage to convince an entire group of people to join in their crazy quest. Meh, but not meh enough to turn it off. Once Benji is stuck in the first tunnel, I put my phone down. I do not like caves, I do not like tight spaces.From there, they continue to make a few questionable decisions, like many a horror movie character does, but I'm not sure how rational I'd think in their situation. Attach yourself to a rope before you jump into unknown and cloudy water! Stop touching stuff!After Siouxie gets her face bashed in, it really picks up and just builds on all that tension and plenty of really creepy stuff happens. When dude got stuck inside the cave floor, feet sticking up yet still alive...oh lord, no. The hooded demon alone in a chair inside a giant cavern in the damn dark? I wouldn't walk near that dude if my life depended on it.Then the end was kind of weird and I'm not totally sure how the upside down thing is supposed to work but I won't really question it. I'm satisfied enough.Acting 8/10

Personal scare factor 9/10","As Above, So Below"
198,registers-944-48791,It'd have been better if it made some sense,3,9 February 2021,"The movie starts with a lot of promise and for some time seemed to be great. But as they advance, it's like they entered on some alternative dimension or into some dream, or simply hell where they are being toyed with.A lot of elements are present which lack explanation, like the dead body which doesn't rot.First the stone works, then it doesn't, then it's the wrong stone, then she has to go all the way back, then they don't even bother to show her finding the stone nor show it!It's another movie that looks like to go out of budget and they don't have time to shoot the rest of the movie and just rush it.Shame.","As Above, So Below"

201,gokeymichael,"As Above, So Below: Loved it!",9,29 June 2015,"I am not typically a ""Found Footage"" genre kind of guy. But if there was ever an exception, this movie is that exception. Very well done. Great use of the catacombs with multiple POV's. Each person had their own helmet cam and there was a cameraman who had his camera and a head cam. That means full coverage and multiple views in order to see more of the environment. That is key to me. Found footage flicks tend to miss so much of the environment because of limited POV's. The acting was good, so no complaints on that front. The environment they used, the catacombs, made the film. You could just feel the tension and anxiety of being in there, not to mention the claustrophobia. This movie went into an area of storyline that I love, actually a couple of elements. The two academics could interpret the writings on the walls in order to get to the treasure they sought. Sort of a horror films Da Vinci Code. The other element was the destination of the forbidden area, the gates of hell. I have this weird interest in filmmakers interpretations of what hell is or the road to hell. How they see it and what it represents visually. Weird things kept happening the closer they go to their destination. Quick little visuals that were there and then gone. Going in circles when the route they took was straight. Going forward and the way is identical to what they had already passed, except things were opposite, mirrored. Trippy things so to speak. In a nutshell, this movie kicked azz and made me happy that I watched it, period.","As Above, So Below"
202,evan-pahl,Scary as Hell and Highly Underrated,10,1 November 2020,"As far as found-footage style horror movies go, this one is highly underrated. Comparative to Blair Witch Project, being the one all other of this style in the genre tends to be judged against, As Above So Below is much faster paced with some higher intensity scenes of action and suspense, deeper seated mystery and horror, and a better developed plot and characters. The historical context and realistic setting of the story taking place in the Catacombs of Paris adds to the percieved realism and creepiness of the plot.
Actor Ben Feldman had a dynamic part in the 2009 Friday the 13th reboot, it's only fitting he got a leading role, and fits it really well. However Perdita Weeks' character tends to be the annoying determined know-it-all, if her acting to fit that role was intentional, she did a good job.
Give this film a serious consideration for a good horror movie.","As Above, So Below"
203,japseyee,underrated for good reason,5,31 October 2020,"Someone describes this film as an underrated gem. well in my opinion it's underrated for good reason - its just but that good.
It passed an evening, and I've seen worse films. It provided s few jump scares, like when the lights come on there's a surge of music and a ghost screaming in your face. But after they done that so many times it kinda wears thin.
The ending doesn't really make much sense but by that time you don't really care. your just thankful its finished and you can get to bed","As Above, So Below"
204,jensenholmesPA,On my 'all time favorite' list,10,29 March 2015,"Seeing this crop up on a few 'years best' horror lists, I decided to give it a try. It was WAY better than I expected. My husband and I both loved it. The metaphysical aspects of the story (philosopher's stone, alchemy, esoteric occult philosophy) was integrated in a deep way into the structure of the film and of the fabric of the Paris underground. It was much more intelligent than most horror films ever try to be. Whereas so many horror films fail when they reveal the monster at the end, this film exceeds expectation. The last quarter of the underground were genuinely original and terrifying and the ending was perfection. There were several spots where I jumped/screamed, which is unusual for me since I've seen so many horror films. But beyond the solid execution and genuine thrills, I really love this film for the interesting integration of real occult philosophy. If you like Dan Brown metaphysical thrillers, you'll like this. This one goes on my all time favorites list!","As Above, So Below"

206,paigeurquidi,"National Treasure, but make it ""scary""",4,30 May 2020,"Big sigh.Where to begin. This movie broke me a little bit. It started off so strong. Great opening set up (maybe a little slow, but great build), great acting, and great premise. They set up a lot of plot points that have major payoffs later, which tied up almost all loose ends. Everything else is nitpicky.I really liked the hand cam documentary style of filmmaking they used. It made the viewer feel more claustrophobic, and really added to the tension. The horror was hit or miss for me. Some parts really kept me on the edge of my seat, mainly the bits where characters got stuck or caved in on.Where it lost me, was the editing. The trippy jump cut strobe light effect brought me out of the movie entirely, and felt like a cheap gag. Not to mention, the jump scares of people walking in the background were lazy and added nothing.I was still rooting for this movie up until the scene where the stone repaired a broken arm. Even that was somewhat forgivable, but it was a huge turning point in the movie. From then on, magic was real and it went from kind of creepy to very cheesey and predictable. The editing got worse, characters started dying at an alarming pace, and things didn't make any sense.The moment I lost all hope and respect for this movie, was the second the lead realized ""the magic was inside her the whole time"". Then, and you can't make this garbage up, she heals her new boy toy with true loves kiss. What. I actually yelled at my tv. Had I paid to see this in theaters, I would have thrown my popcorn and walked out.It felt out of place, cheesey, and cheap. I felt robbed of an above average horror movie. This movie made me want to learn to edit so I could fix everything I hated about the end 30 minutes.From there, the movie ends in the exact same way as Disney's Enchanted. True loves kiss saves the day, they emerge from an upside down man hole, and everyone lives happily ever after. Unbelievable.Bonus: this is a minor detail, but there is no reason for them to be using miles and feet. The lead is from London, they are in Paris, and so was Nicholas Flamel is French. They should be using the Metric system yet constantly talk in terms of feet. Bothers me greatly.","As Above, So Below"

Yes I know Blair Witch started it all, a great film by the way, but even that looked calm & tranquil compared to the ridiculous OTT camera work.

211,vinzarka,No good taste at the end,3,30 January 2015,"It started well...stable scenario...interesting and looks scary and interesting. The main actress was so well qualified in her profession and her studies. Her knowledges about symbols were so clear and so enough to find what she was going to find...but for a simple public everything went so fast and many things left with the wind. It was not clear enough what the director wanted to express with this movie...what this girl wanted to discover. Sometimes, during the way of watching this movie, the sense of the meaning is fading...and many scary things are included inside this movie just to make us confuse. I cannot say that it was totally bad movie but there were many unnecessary elements inside it. The director should stay in searching of something which was considered very important for the humanity.","As Above, So Below"
212,nazthegreat1,Much better than expected,9,27 September 2018,"Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of found footage films; I cannot stand the shakiness of the cameras and generally turn those movies off immediately. The only reason I kept going in this movie was because of the lead actress, and I'm glad I didn't stop.The movie itself is gripping and somewhat original, well thought out and the fact that it was filmed in the actual catacombs adds a quality to it that a set couldn't compare to. I wouldn't consider it SCARY, I rarely find movies to be scary though, but it was still very entertaining. I can honestly say I loved every moment of it.","As Above, So Below"
213,mober1996,A great addition to the horror community,7,2 January 2015,"""As Above, So Below"" is an interesting take on the modern day horror film. The film contains an interesting concept and plot but has a strange execution, one such to where I keep finding myself think that it was sloppy, then 10 minutes later thinking it's good, then another 10 minutes later thinking it's sloppy again, and keep going through this cycle for a huge portion of the film.One of the most interesting parts about the execution of the film was that rather than just throwing up a jump-scare every five minutes, it seemed to play a lot more on the fears of individuals. *Spoilers Incoming* A great example of this is shown when Benji (Edwin Hodge) is seen crawling through a small gap between bones and a limestone ceiling, and everything is going fine until Benji gets himself stuck in the middle of the crawlspace. Benji suffers from claustrophobia and there is a no longer than 2-minute scene of Benji slowly slipping into madness during his time stuck in the space. As I was sitting there watching this, not suffering from claustrophobia myself, I couldn't help but find myself utterly terrified watching this scene play out. I felt as if I was actually immersed into Hodge's character and actually slipping into madness just like Benji did. This whole concept of playing on people's fears really improved the perspective of this movie. The biggest problem I had was watching this movie constantly jump to new stuff going on. This gave the movie a constant sloppy feel to it. From nightclubs, random spooky pianos; it never really felt like there was a buildup to a lot of the plot points. It kept the movie going, but I constantly kept asking myself ""What the hell is going on?"" The fact that the cameras were also these shaky go- pros was not a big help either. ""As Above, So Below"" is quite a mystery. If you are into the more psychological horror style, I would this recommend more for you rather than those just looking for the constant thrills. The movie also has a 20-30 minute opening before anything interesting happens. A little bit more length might done this movie just slightly better. But once it hits the moment where the catacombs fully come into play, it really starts hitting at home with the stuff that is enjoyable and what I like to see in a horror movie. The surprise ending also threw me for a loop and left me thinking (about what, I won't say).Final Review Score: 7/10","As Above, So Below"

217,freeist,"Pretty good, but a little too shaky",5,23 September 2018,"This movie is a combination of ""National Treasure,"" ""Tomb Raider,"" and ""The Descent."" Perdita Weeks plays the manically obsessed archeologist, Scarlett, looking for the Philosopher's Stone. (I forgot to include ""Harry Potter"" in the mix, didn't I?) A clue from Iran leads her to believe the Stone is somewhere in or around the Paris catacombs. She enlists the help of a reluctant ex-boyfriend George (Ben Feldman) for his skills in Aramaic. He then ends up going along for the whole trip. They need help for the more remote areas of the catacombs, so they hire three guides, played by Francios Civil, Marion Lambert, and Ali Marhyar. Unfortunately, Benji (Edwin Hodge) a videographer making a documentary about Scarlett, also comes along. I say this not due to anything about Hodge's performance, which was solid. No, I say it because a documentary-maker on the expedition could only mean the rest of the movie would be in shaky-cam. And man, was it. ""As Above, So Below"" is ruined by the old shake 'n' quake gimmick. This isn't even a horror cliche. It's just a mistake. What's worse, there was a time that Scarlett is alone without Benji or anyone else to agitate the camera at her. For once I thought I'd be able to follow what was going on. Wrong. The camera was attached to her for more jolting and jittering and even less visual coherency.The movie only has a $5mil budget. So, most of the thrills in the dark never rise above the Halloween haunted house level. These are mostly leering weirdos and creepy sounds that never come to a coherent cause. If the shaky cam is used to obscure poor makeup jobs, then it works. However, cheesy masks than motion sick. Weeks character spends most of her underground time trying to interpret ancient verse, which strangely enough rhymes in direct translation from Aramaic. That, more than anything else, should have alerted Scarlett that there was some bad magic afoot. The acting was more solid than usual for a low-budget horror movie. This makes a few awful lines bearable. Weeks performance as Scarlett lifts the rest of the movie. So, it isn't a complete loss. I don't know how anyone prepares to watch for watching a shaky cam movie, but if you don't mind the jerking and jarring, you can mark my rating up three stars.","As Above, So Below"
218,ukclaire_475,Really surprisingly scary....loved it!,9,10 September 2014,"First and foremost; I love horror. I am HUGE horror fan in fact! Prior to entering the cinema my words were 'I never jump at horror films, I am literally desensitised' - words I later came to regret. This film actually scared the living daylights out of me. I was actually quite scared from the moment they go into the catacombs. The confined spaces were horrendous and the film almost took you in them with the cast....you felt entombed yourself! The creepy guy who had been trapped down there for a number of years...the way he stood, his voice and more so; the fact he has been down there without a light....the notion of that itself creeped me out. The sound effects were great...from the get go when the main star (annoying British chick with horrendous posh accent!) goes in search of artefacts in Iran, were so loud and really made an impact. Then they reached the tomb (creepy dead guy, akin to the Knight in Indiana Jones: ROTLA) and had to swim under the wall (which I might add I think they stole from a game in The Crystal Maze) I liked this bit a a lot. WELL, I liked it more when it all became upside down....eeeek.... The hooded, cloak wearing 'thing' really shook me up too. Okay, so the film had some stupid bits (all horrors do, this is why we love them!) such as the stone healing bit and them jumping down the bottomless pit after admitting their wrongdoings....all a tres tad annoying. However, overall I loved it and I am sure fellow horror film fans will too....it is scary...it is worth full-ticket price and you should go and see it...I have to give it 9/10Lights on for me for a week!!!!","As Above, So Below"

It was original, the cast was wonderful. Initially I gave this film an 8 out of 10. Then I read an analysis of the film, watched it again, and only then could I really appreciate As Above, So Below in its entirety. With inspiration drawn from Dante's Comedy (in such a way that the main characters seem to have ended up in the inferno that Alighieri describes; think of the scene in which Papillon protrudes only with his legs out of the sand, something that down to the letter occurs in Dante's Comedy) I find As Above, So Below something entirely different, and that alone is an accomplishment in the horror genre since these days most horror flicks are similar to each other, the characters are flat and the tropes are repetitive. 10/10 for a film I often think about.","As Above, So Below"

I don't even know where to begin. So the concept was great, catacombs leading to a secret treasure, great. But there are just so many storylines they don't tie up at the end. Is there a cult that lives underground? Are we just not going to talk about the dusty phone and childhood piano down there? Is it the gates of Hell? Is it just the stone playing tricks on them? Also, for a good laugh, I recommend the ""chomping teeth on the floor"" scene. Honestly, what were they going to do, bite her feet until she died? Also- when you translate something from Aramaic into English, IT WONT RHYME IN ENGLISH. All in all, my roommates and I had a pretty good time making fun of this movie, but it's realoy better on paper than it is as finished product.","As Above, So Below"
223,stevendedalis,Here we go,5,2 September 2018,"This movie is all over the place in both crazy, interesting, and just plain stupid.The crazy: So here we have two characters in there early to mid-twenties. Somehow the girl has 2 Ph.Ds and speaks six languages fluently. The guy can translate languages that have been dead for hundreds of years in a matter of seconds. The interesting: The movie is basically a symbolic runoff of Dante's Inferno. Going through the Nine Circles of Hell, going through hell to get out of hell, etc. This part is interesting, but when watching the movie for the first time it is extremely confusing. In fact, it was so confusing I had to look up what the movie was actually about. The Stupid: The majority of the movie rests here in the stupid section. We have multiple scenes that stuck out to me in particular. Such as the car on fire. The man is dragged into the fire by nothing and then is seen only with his legs dangling while the rest of his body is underground. Yes I understand they are in hell, but this is just so stupid. Next we have the stone. A one-time use stone that can heal anything and apparently bring people back to life. And then the main character realizes that ""she is the stone"". Do you understand how stupid that phrase sounds?Overall, this movie was an extremely good representation of hell. However, it is so confusing and some parts are so unrealistic and stupid that I myself was heard just laughing at the sheer stupidity of the writers. My rating originally started at a 3/10 but I increased it to 5/10 after reading the symbolism of the movie.","As Above, So Below"

226,neko1962,The popcorn was the best part...........,2,13 September 2014,"Really, the popcorn we bought was the best part of this new film, As Above, So Below. And..............I wanted to like it. Not love the movie, but just 'like' it. Like it just a little I did not. Let me explain: About five minutes into this horror flick, the credibility of the central she-male (beautiful as she was) character ran about dry as Phoenix in August. Dry bro. The movie screen writing folks make an early semi-plaid attempt at boosting her intellectual resume, but she never comes even close to a Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, or Nicholas Cage in as Ben Cates in National Treasure. She's not convincing at any point in the film actually. With this said, and knowing the whole underground (So Below) tunnel fixation is her suggestion, and everything she encounters is basically explained by Ms. Maybelline, I began to long for the $8.00 spent at the ticket window (relax, it was a matinée). 8.00 X two people mind you = 16.00. Sixteen dollars listening to ""I know we can find it"" on the over-used ""shaky cam"" projector style. Styles that make some viewers feel distracted, dizzy or sick. Some viewers like my wife. My wife was physically nauseated by this reality type movie cam, but I was ill thinking I had paid for this. Keep in mind; I really 'wanted' to like it.","As Above, So Below"

229,j-chutlashvili-958-290980,Quite scary movie,10,21 November 2014,"I'm giving this movie 8/10 & below are reasons why: First, it's original, different from other horror movies, which brings interesting story, where crowd of few people seek historic relic & treasure. Movie was very eerie & creepy, especially when they go deeper & deeper close to hell. Some very strong & intense moments. Atmosphere was also eerie cause whole movie happens in damn catacombs. If you have Claustrophobia I don't recommend to watch it. However, I didn't like acting of actors & actresses in some scenes, where they should be more frightened but they weren't, especially when you know you're stuck somewhere underground deeper & hell knows where's exit & you encounter something supernatural, evil presence in those dark catacombs. The second thing I didn't like - the ending. In my opinion ending should be more tragic. When they opened that manhole cover there should be hell & they should all die there. Then it would be scary, suitable ending for that film. All in all, good horror movie. If you're fan of movies like The Tunnel(2011) or The Devil's pass, you gonna like it.","As Above, So Below"

The entrance in the hell, where the writing above it says ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."" is from Dante's inferno. In Dante's inferno, Dante discovers that the only way out of hell is to keep going down, through the belly of the hell.The movie leaves you with the vial of secrecy, you only realize what it was about, after it's over.

235,da_zapata,A Claustrophobic Journey Into Historical Mythology,8,10 November 2014,"Found-footage horror films are a dime a dozen these days, growing in popularity since the first Paranormal Activity film seven years ago and fueling unwatchable copycat mediocrity. The scares are cheap, the story lines are bland, and the originality is nonexistent. Thankfully, As Above/So Below manages to break past these barriers and create a new, atmospherically tormenting energy.One of the key aspects that makes As Above stand apart is its historical context. It is based on the real-life Catacombs that exist underground in Paris and the history that accompanies these Catacombs, particularly the manner in which it they were used as an underground cemetery and hold the remains of over 6 million bodies. As Above/So Below is lead by a valiant and uncompromising heroine, Scarlet, whose main goal is to enter the underground tunnels of the Catacombs in search of the Philosopher's Stone—a journey her own father embarked on that resulted in dementia and suicide. With the help of her friends and a mysterious but trustworthy group of French explorers, Scarlet enters the Catacombs in search of the mystical Stone, which she believes holds the key to immeasurable power.As the group descends into the Catacombs, it is not long before physical obstacles and an overwhelming sense of dread washes over Scarlet and the explorers. They plunge deeper and deeper into the unknown, and the dark mythology becomes palpable through hellishly surreal imagery. Shaky cameras and tightly closed areas make for a very chilling experience, so this is definitely not a film for anyone with claustrophobia or motion sickness.As Above progresses with subtle intelligence, requiring one to listen to each character's backstory and the manner in which it plays into the film as it progresses. There is a constant, unnerving feeling of hopelessness as the group continues to descend thousands of feet underground in their attempt to escape. Essentially, As Above is a gritty survival film that just happens to step into the boundaries of mysticism and occult-like terror. As a whole, the film is as cleverly constructed as much as it dark and menacing, despite its somewhat mediocre final act. However, this does not take away from its intensely distressing sequences and hypnotic cinematography. The Catacombs feel like a demonic presence all their own in the film, making the film all the more enjoyable for genre fans.Of course, As Above/So Below is not a timeless horror classic. It uses typical jump scares and found-footage camera effects that we've all seen before. However, it stands apart as a mythological look into real history, capturing actual imagery of the skulls and bones that lie in the underground tunnels of the Catacombs in Paris. It is graphically dismal yet beautifully macabre, which functions in perfect duality with the frightfully suspenseful nature of the film. Despite its murky repetitiveness and cheap thrills, As Above/So Below is a bone-chilling tale of survival and the inner demons that haunt us, both above ground and below.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)","As Above, So Below"
236,parrishcub,"One of the Few Good ""Found Footage"" Horror Films",8,30 June 2015,"AS A TECH, SO I KNOW Having labeled ""As Above, So Below"" in the found footage category would not be accurate, but it is a Point-of-View horror film. Shot in clearer-than-life HD, the shakiness of more intense sequences may look light-years better than the Hi-8/16mm format of Blair Witch, but with technological advances, especially in photographic stability, any jittery footage is avoidable. In that vein, some scenes were not given the TLC that could have made this 90- minute- descent into the French catacombs even scarier. Budget issues? Lazy crew? A combo? No clue.CATACOMBS OF CREEPY What is a spookier concept than to take a tour of the endless maze of human remains tunneling beneath the streets of Paris? The answer: to do so unofficially to seek a specific object out. What unfolds in unnerving real time is a series of increasingly-unsettling, disturbing, eerie, and downright terrifying scenes that rarely let up for a quick breath before either causing the viewer to leap out of their skin (catacombs have SO MANY DARK CORNERS) or getting under that same flesh with nightmarish imagery, suffocating suspense, and NOPE-inducing sounds. Rather bloody at times but implied enough to not be categorized as gory, this unexpected exception to the clearance-equivalent-fright-fest-horror-sub-genre will not only cause as much disorientation in the viewer as the cast, it will also inspire the need to watch something MUCH more light-hearted before bed.

238,nora-84307,Good and bad at the same time,4,8 May 2020,"The movie was okay. The plot was good enough for something that I'd read in a book, not watch in a movie though. Something about it seemed almost too cheesy and bugged me a lot. There were times where things were so frustrating and illogical it hurt. And it was so unrealistic at some points it makes me wonder why some people say it felt like it was actually real.","As Above, So Below"
239,adelca02,Excellent must-see!,9,23 June 2020,"Suspenseful & engaging throughout the whole movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat.
Think of it as The Descent, which was very good, but deeper & more thrilling. Highly recommend!!","As Above, So Below"
240,gurpreetsinghubs,An inteligent effort.,9,29 March 2021,"Through out the movie I felt that it was a decent effort to make an entertaining movie, however in the last sequence *spoiler starts* the reversal of gravity* just blew me away and I could not stop smiling as to how intelligently the movie makers crafted this movie around Dante's inferno. The whole movie now made enough sense to me. It now made me to think and jump on to internet.People rating low for this movie based on mere aesthetics ,which in my opinion are actually great, have no clue about the depth of the plot.Teams who bring out such intelligent products of art should be applauded and appreciated. Highly recommended.","As Above, So Below"
241,innerdesire,Drunk teens with shaky phone cameras,3,21 November 2014,"This might have been a decent movie, but I can't really say. I walked out 15 minutes in to it and demanded a refund. If a producer wishes to exclude 30% of their audience by making their product so shaky as to induce nausea, vomiting, and migraines, then they should consider a 3 of 10 rating on IMDb a blessing. Buy a freakin tripod or steadycam rig. At least stop adding extra shake in post. Even though I wanted to watch and like this movie, and was seriously disappointed, I still have to laugh when I see the budget of this production. Drunk teenagers with phone cameras are literally producing more professional work on youtube. The shaky effect doesn't make the viewer feel like they are a part of the action, and they just 'go with it', it induces nausea, vomiting, migraines and continuously reminds one they are watching an amateur quality production. If you insist on using this effect, know going in that you're precluding about 30% of the population from viewing your product.","As Above, So Below"
242,mamasage,Too fast paced for this old brain to process,5,15 June 2021,"Blair Witch Project style filming that moved too quickly for both dialog and action for me.

243,moodorf,I was waiting for it to get good and it never happened,4,13 February 2020,"Rarely do I watch movies that make a bad first impression on me to completion, but this one I held out some hope for. However the movie became less compelling and more predictable as it progressed. The setting to this film had some potential but the lame scares, questionable writing and the 'found footage' style ruined it.If you want to see a good horror movie with a similar theme, watch ""The Descent""","As Above, So Below"
244,arenaf-28381,"Couldn't understand the negative reviews at first, until the ending",6,19 January 2020,"The movie had a great build-up and was headed in the right direction. Subtle hints that they're at the gates of hell, the old piano from someone's childhood, the upside down and reversed settings. And then you have the ending which consisted of a few cheap jumpscares and a 1-minute ""confession"" session of demons the characters confront from their past. Then, they're back outside in the real world again. It left much to be desired. Also there was a scene where Papillion sees presumably an old friend in the car and says it wasn't his fault, we never receive any explanation or back story for this or for the girl from the nightclub appearing in the cave. I feel like a better way to end the story would be so that the character's are back outside but in an alternate reality proving they never escaped hell.","As Above, So Below"

247,gotjee_arts,One of my all-time favorite horror movies,10,21 September 2021,"It's one of the few found-footage flicks where I genuinely constantly forget I'm watching the action unfold through hand-held cameras. The pace takes a certain time to rev up but never lets up once the first otherworldly chills begin to manifest. The atmosphere is such a specific detached, truly nightmarish haze that slowly thickens as the descent progresses that it feels like you are trapped within the bone labirynth together with the protagonists by the time it's too late to turn back. Aesthetically the big thematic setpieces are gorgeous and extremely well-crafted. An automatic rewatch every couple of years for me.","As Above, So Below"
248,pan-pandey,The most scary movie I have seen in years. 10/10,10,12 July 2016,"Well the movie is scary because the location makes it scary. If makes you feel like you are one of the crew members, trapped in the catacombs and have no way out than the fear gradually starts building inside you. You don't need a ghost to scare you or a flying dragon, or a zombie to scare you. But the feeling that you are going slowly towards a painful death and you can't do anything about it, scares you mentally. I guess I could have watched it in 3d. Because if a 2d film can make me so involved in it, guess what a 3d film will do. Imagine you are inside a box and you have no way out and you are slowly dying due to lack of oxygen... what would be your feeling ? this film gives you the same feeling. This film is a treat for horror film lovers, not visually but mentally. I give 10 out of 10.","As Above, So Below"

250,itai-orion,Originality and style are lost in the haze of nausea-inducing camera-work,5,17 February 2017,"As Above, So Below is a survival-horror video game I would have loved to play. In fact, as I watched it, I couldn't help but wish that someone would adapt it for the much more suitable genre.The film's premise and basic plot are intelligent enough to enjoy, and as usual the blend of ancient mythologies in a ""relic-hunt"" (as per Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider) is something I would have liked to explore more fully. Unfortunately since this is a feature film that had to enclose its dose of jump-scares and shaky-cam, it set up a great first act and then proceeded to dash it thoroughly with standard horror-movie tropes for the entire rest of its run-time. The actors are adequate but their characters unoriginal, and as with all ""found-footage"" films there are multiple instances in which the camera/cameraman are shoehorned back into the plot so that the footage can continue to be created. The film was shot on location in the catacombs of Paris, and I am deeply sorry that we did not get more solid camera-work of this unique and fantastic location. Opportunities wasted make me peeved, and as such I could not quite settle in for the mediocre B-Horror that is this film....","As Above, So Below"
251,stacm-white_06,People missing the artful layers of this diamond,9,28 August 2016,"The only explanation I can think of as to why a too substantial crowd is giving poor reviews of this powerful film is that they are simply only looking at the shallow. I'm sorry......Descent?? The Tunnel?? Indiana Jones meets horror? National Treasure? And OMG the MOST ridiculous, Harry Potter?? What is the matter with people? Did the topic of the Flamel Stone trip you up? Alchemy existed long before J.K. Rowlings pre-teen interpretation. Did the barrage of bad 'found footage' crap just turn brains off? I have yet to read a review, even a good one, that touches much at all on the nuances here. I like horror but I don't have much respect at all for a plot less, mindless, slasher, insult to intelligence that is a majority of the genre. Here....well....you have to know a little before you 'get' it. Classical mythology, religious studies, human nature, philosophy, perception, and oh my word.....has NO ONE ever read Dantes Inferno??? The symbology is deep. The processes and the order in which they occur are rich with meaning. You just have to know how to find it and learn how to critique a movie (or book or any work of art) on more than just surface crap. 'Lame main female character', 'unoriginal', 'horrible shaky camera' (Uh....intended!), 'Tomb Raiderish'. Please, please at least give this a chance and try to figure it out for yourself. Look beneath the surface....below (pun fits whether intended or not), the camera, the girls, the 20 somethings, the ridiculous comparisons to utterly abominable references, and let your mind work on this one. Let yourself question your own perception, point of reference, assumptions, hang ups. I have not watched a 'horror/thriller' movie in years that I could walk away from feeling that the writers and producers actually gave me the benefit of the doubt of having respectable intelligence. This was a very pleasantly disturbing wreck to my nerves....and one I will never forget. Am certain I can give it a few days, watch again and find another gem I missed. What a wonderful surprise from a movie I expected little of. And perhaps therein lies the problem with too many opinions of this....you had way too LOW, high expectations and forced the film into them instead of thinking outside the limited box. Have never felt need to speak on behalf of a horror flick before. But then to even classify it as such..... People have just lowered their standards for what that even means. Is it perfect? No. There are certainly some things that could've been a little bit less 'bare minimum', But it's one of the closest I've seen. The build up is ingenious. The unique representations of evils and even the jump-scares, are another level entirely. Oh and....watch this in the dark with headphones! Even the sounds are straight out of classical lit and add yet another layer of just plain creepy.","As Above, So Below"
252,leominosa,Bog-standard mainstream horror; tired and contrived,4,1 September 2014,"Here's your set-up: preposterously well-educated and pretty Lara Croft-ish young British woman, motivated by her dead Dad, is on the hunt for the apparent Holy Grail of archaeology (no not the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, which I always thought was supposed to be an elusive substance rather than an actual physical stone, but she seems to have new information). Luckily for us, and the executive producers, a guy happens to be filming her quest for a documentary. She ends up in Paris for reasons that were probably explained and hooks up with an old acquaintance; a not unattractive American who spends his time fixing old church bells without permission (!). Clues are followed that eventually take them into the Parisian catacombs with a trio of locals who were persuaded to help with the promise of ""treasure"". Really.As with many mainstream, commercial horrors I was cringing myself inside out within a few minutes of the film starting. Some parts are offensively stupid. For instance, somebody translates some text from Aramaic out loud, and lo and behold it translates into perfect rhyming couplets in modern English.Nevertheless it's a relatively fun premise, and of course once they get into the catacombs and things get a bit supernatural, implausibility becomes a valid element of the plot and it's pretty much a ghost train of a ride from thereon. The underground setting is actually quite dull, but a blandly entertaining mix of claustrophobia, mystery and mythology keeps things interesting in the quieter moments between the scares and deaths, even if it's a load of nonsense. There's not much more to it than that.I have complaints about the way the ""found footage"" format is employed, but the problems are so common and inherent that they should just be taken for granted.Ultimately this film hasn't been made for the type of horror fan that loves the genre, it's for people who like going to the cinema and occasionally watching a relatively scary film. If the latter is your thing and you're easily pleased then you may enjoy it (some of the people in the screening I was in apparently did), otherwise steer clear.","As Above, So Below"

Works great as a found footage horror, the scares are awesome and chilling. Reading some of the other comments here, I see that there is a set of books to be read in order to fully grasp the movie's concept?!

255,hwrd-hall,"""Indie'film Jones and the Sewer of Doom""",1,6 March 2021,"WARNING! Some spoilers...Well, Perdita Weeks is, unquestionably, a skilled actress, and was the only reason my wife and I clicked-up the flick in the first place. Unfortunately, this bit of phlegm... er, um... I mean... ""film""... is, unquestionably, one of the most atrocious wastes of time and money in the entire history of atrocious wastes of time and money.Ms. Weeks, in general, is smart, funny, quick, self-deprecating, and possesses an excellent sense of comedic timing, all of which she demonstrates regularly in her current, thoroughly-enjoyable role of Juliet Higgins, on ""Magnum, P.I."" (Yes, it's a formulaic, procedural ""reboot"", but it's still fun! Unlike this movie...)Alas, although her performance was among the only bright spots in this ""stain on the entertainment industry"", few, if any, of her skills were needed or on display here. In fact, considering their ages and limited experience, most of the cast of ""As Above..."" delivered creditable performances which rose considerably above their material and direction, and they will, quite likely, have decent careers in their field.The Brothers Dowdle? (screenwriters / director) Maybe not so much...First, let me say, I have nothing against ""cinema verite"", per se. Just as, ""Variety is the spice of life..."", so cinema verite can be the ""spice"" of motion-picture-making, when used properly and sparingly, by a genuinely talented director. Well-crafted films such as the ""Bourne"" trilogy and ""District 9"" are tremendously enhanced by its judicious application. When flagrantly abused by a rank amateur, however, as the only cinematographic ""arrow"" in their ""quiver"", and relentlessly wreaked upon the full length of a feature film, it's more like some clueless idiot pureed a half-dozen Carolina Reapers into a single bowl of chili!The only thing more annoying (...and that's pretty irritating, just on its own!), is, perhaps, partly my own problem - as a professional camera operator for more than four decades, it's easy for me to recognize whenever ""shaky-cam"" is, in reality, ""faky-cam"", with some moron deliberately jostling the camera around, utterly failing to achieve a sort of ""simula verite"", while congratulating him or herself on their ""creativity""! (It's hard to ""suspend my disbelief"" when half my brain is screaming, ""Go buy a cheap tripod, ya cheap biped!"")This is the main reason I have virtually no use, whatsoever, for any of the ""fully-found-footage"" films which have been inflicted on a long-suffering viewing public over the last several decades. (Fortunately, the trailers and advertising matter told me all I needed to know in order to scrupulously avoid ""Blair Witch Project"" (1999) - while it may not have been the first, it was certainly one of the worst! Sadly, I wasn't quite so lucky with ""Monster"" or ""Cloverfield"" (both 2008).)""Predictable"" hardly begins to adequately describe just how predictable this movie is. ""Hackneyed""? ""Trite""? ""Unoriginal""? Now, we're getting a little closer... It starts out with such promise, then descends into the catacombs under Paris, and straight into every shopworn, threadbare cliché and trope there is in the ""Doomed-Expedition-Into-The-Mysterious-And-Accursed-Dark-Underbelly-Of-History"" genre. The typical ""obsessed professor/scientist with something to prove"", dragging along her ""reluctant sidekick/possible once-and-future love-interest"" (...the ""hapless schmuck with the paranoid terror of {fill-in-the-blank plot-device}""...), hires the requisite ""rag-tag, slightly-psycho, basically-mercenary troupe"", led by the ""cocky local tour guide"" (""I am NOT ze tour guide!""). Then, they all dive, head-first, into the ""hopelessly-under-lit set-piece du jour"", ""ill-equipped and under-prepared"", ""barely one step ahead of the law"", etc., etc., etc., blah, blah, flippin' blah...From the moment the piano demonstrated its ""...A4 key..."", it was absurdly self-evident that the ""evil"" section of the catacombs, into which they had ineptly and incompetently allowed the obviously-dead ""La Taupe"" to ""Will-o'-the-Wisp"" them (I was literally shouting at the screen, ""Quit lettin' him dance out ahead of ya, barely at the outer edges of your lights! Grab him, and force him to stop talkin' in riddles, right now, or you're all doomed!""), was using their own minds against them, and that the hyper-realistic illusions it was presenting were it's only real ""weapon"". That, and the tired, old, ""every tunnel always conveniently caves-in right behind you, so you can't turn back now"" gag.Sheesh!Who keeps handing money to the talentless children who dream-up this kind of drivel? How many truly creative films will never be made, now that the money which should have been wisely invested in them was, instead, wasted on worthless drek like this? I'd much rather have just watched an actual documentary on the Paris catacombs... (In point of fact, now that I think about it, I actually HAVE watched documentaries on the Paris catacombs - vastly more interesting than this nonsense! ...and I sincerely hope those were all plastic ""prop"" skeletons they were crawling over and trashing, not somebody's ancestors!)And, can anyone please explain to me: What the heck is the point of going to all the hassle of shooting in the actual catacombs of Paris, when you end up with less than 5 minutes of screen-time, out of 90 minutes' run-time, wherein you can actually tell it's ""...the actual catacombs of Paris...""?!?Summing-up: Although the lady, herself, is a talented performer, I have to say, this particular Perdi Weeks vehicle was ""purty weak""!","As Above, So Below"
256,cyberdeck2000,Harry Potter meets Indiana Jones meets the catacombs of Paris,7,28 December 2014,"I'm going to start by pointing out I'm an American. I do that because my first comment has to do with the Americans making denigrating or nasty comments about the lead actresses character and the skills they find so unbelievable.I speak to people around the world on a regular basis and generally end up feeling like Americans are illiterate, unmotivated morons with an inferiority complex. That pretty much sums up my view of our international politics and the generic mindset of my fellow citizens.Why do I say that, I talk to these foreigners and routinely, they speak 3-5 languages and can struggle their way through a few more. Anyone that takes foreign language courses is told that in Europe it is common for people to speak at minimum 2 languages and OFTEN more. But a well educated British character was trashed by the reviewers that I read on this site for pretty much being well educated. To my fellow Americans, get over it. We suck at accepting others, we suck at education and generally we urinate (they wouldn't let me use the better word for this) on the rest of the world. Americans and our government treat the rest of the world like we are making up for having a 2 inch penis. I personally resent that because I don't even have a penis.Now, my review. It was an okay movie, I laughed when they got to the part of the plot that talked about the clues. If you watch, you'll get what I mean, or maybe not. It didn't scare me and I'm a pushover for freaking out at scary movies. It did engage my attention to some extent but it needed more tension than I felt they brought to it with that script. It was a decent one time viewing type movie.","As Above, So Below"

It has some memorable moments, really. Sound played in a good way and had some twists that I didn't anticipate.. well, I don't watch any movie or tv show wanting to know what will be going to happen next.
What I didn't like is the fact that some characters died. Why isn't a horror movie were nobody dies? At least I expect someone hurt, even a lot.. even mentally, but not in here (some did, but not main characters)

260,phantlers,Risible rubbish,1,20 January 2015,"An hour and a half I'll never get back. Starts off with the heroine reciting her c.v. into camera for a supposed documentary in the making and continues in this shaky hand-held phony-reality mode throughout, increasingly annoyingly.For much (too much) of the film the viewer is subjected to meaningless, blurred imagery of the type one gets when walking down the street with one's phone video camera running. IOW, utterly meaningless and very, very cheap, nasty and lazy. Found footage my arse, found where, in the dustbin out behind a high street photo shop?The female lead, one Perdita Weeks (who sounds like a pound-shop Connie Nielsen in Gladiator - RP as shorthand for super-intelligent, highly educated, morally impeccable - d'uh) is unconvincing from the get-go and the whole film 'turns' on her (a supposed world authority on archaeology, alchemy and several related academic disciplines) discovering The Philosopher's Stone and then trousering said artifact from a never-before discovered corner of Paris's catacombs. Just like that, and as indeed you do - if you are Charles Peace and not David Attenborough.It ends very disappointingly with three of the main characters surviving their underground ordeal after an escape that is as unlikely as it is obviously the only way to wrap up this abomination. By that time one might well have lost any empathy with any of them and damn the producers for not killing them all and leaving the mystery intact.It sets out to be Indiana Jones but ends up an extended episode of Scooby Doo does The Crystal Maze. A really, really dull episode.","As Above, So Below"

I had to look away most of the film. And I got confuse on whose perspective it is, most of the time.The concept of semi-reality is appealing, especially for people who like history and secret messages. Even so, it doesn't feel like the movie is ripping-off Da Vinci code. It could be better if there's more depth to the supporting characters and more background on why the place is what it is, but so far, it's good enough. I'd recommend it to horror fans.","As Above, So Below"
262,dukedoom72,Lara Croft and the devils tomb?,8,26 November 2014,"I really loved this movie despite hating the found footage genre. First off its NOT a found footage movie. Nobody finds this footage.. So, young archaeologist/adventurer Scarlett sets out on a quest to find the philosophers stone, which is believed to be in the deepest parts of the Paris catacombs. She and her crew must evade traps, solve riddles and ultimately face hell itself! Luckily Scarlett is an expert tomb raider who also know self defense which comes in handily when she must climb, run and fight off ""stone demons""! As you can see this basically sounds like a Tomb Raider game? And thats what it basically is, its an adventure movie with a hefty dose of mythological horror. Perhaps a bit misdirected in the posters and trailers? Anyways, loved it and felt it was something different than all other gloomy horror films where everybody dies/it was just in their heads. A big surprise which i really recommends to everybody who loves Indiana Jones/Lara croft/demons and adventure! Thumbs up!","As Above, So Below"
263,pokoyo69,Unexpectedly Good!,8,24 May 2020,"I am not a fan of the ""found footage"" sub genre of horror but this movie pleasantly surprised me. It's not a movie for anyone who feels claustrophobic easily or into hack and slash gore fests but for those of you who like a movie with a creepy feel and surrealistic happenings then this movie is for you! Very very refreshing!","As Above, So Below"
264,glen2010,"Admirable attempt, but still falls short",5,13 October 2014,"The horror genre, let alone found-footage horror, has seemed quite stale recently - overused and ineffective, I was open-minded when I heard that As Above, So Below was a found footage-horror done right. To an extent, that was correct.First of all, if you're looking for a festival of gore, jump-scares and hellish creatures, you're in the wrong place. As Above, So Below paces itself, though not tediously so, when building its backstory and constructing its characters. Though I had sort of hoped for a little more horror, I actually did appreciate this technique. It was a refreshingly pleasant surprise and, though some may disagree, I felt some of the calmer, earlier scenes focused towards introducing the story and characters were some of the stronger ones.In addition, the main cast as a whole were generally talented and certainly held their own for the majority of their screen time. Again, this was a pleasant surprise. I actually felt for them at times, I wanted them to survive. They weren't what I'd call your below-average run-of-the-mill demonic-monster-fodder.The film starts to fall short just after the halfway point. It seems to fall into the trap of putting characters in such a uniquely difficult situation that only absurdity, and seemingly-endless running around, will give them any chance of getting out alive. After a well-crafted build up towards their goal, it was a tad disappointing to see it fall into generic, found-footage horror chaos.There were, however, a few solid moments of tension, moments where I may have even held my breath for a few seconds. With that said, the build up of tension was often then anticlimactic, much like the film's actual 'climax' which is likely to leave you feeling somewhat disappointed.In hindsight, the film should have been marketed more as a psychological adventure, rather than a horror flick, as the horror was easily the weaker element of the film. Sometimes watching the characters having their minds messed with by supernatural puzzles was far more entertaining than any demonic presence featured in the film. One scene, in which a character is trapped by falling debris, is perhaps one of the standout moments of the film, capturing claustrophobia and the panic it can cause quite effectively (some moments even being comparable to 'The Descent').Conclusively, As Above, So Below is entertaining if you don't expect too much. What it lacks in horror, it makes up for in its development of character and tension, although since the second half of the film generally focuses on the horror element, it may still disappoint and leave you forgetting any of the previous, admirably-constructed first half.","As Above, So Below"
265,sohrmn,"a decent horror film, with a fair number of plot problems",6,13 September 2014,"As Above, So Below (2014) is a decent horror film, in the ""documentary"" (hand held camera) film style pioneered by the Blair Witch Project (1999). It is also a film with a fair number of plot problems. But first the ""good news"".The basic premise of the film is actually quite cool -- for a slasher/horror film.""Scarlett"" is a gifted archaeologist/alchemy scholar, who has been continuing her late father's quest for the fabled Flamel stone. Legend speaks of this stone, crafted by Nicholas Flamel, as having the ability to create gold and grant eternal life.Her search -- which is not always strictly legal -- earns the attention of a documentary film crew, led by ""Benji"". Thus the ""hand held"" camera style used throughout the film is intended to be part of the documentary's film project.Alas, the stone and the final resting place of Flamel remain a mystery, or do they? Scarlett persuades her ex-boyfriend -- ""George"" -- who is good with reading dead languages to help her dig deeper.All clues point to the vast (and quite creepy) Catacombs that lie beneath Paris. Since neither Scarlett or George has experience with exploring the ancient caves, they enlist the help of a group of local youth; ""Papillon"", his girlfriend ""Souxie"", and friend ""Zed"".Eventually, treasure hunting in the French Catacombs takes the team into hell (talk about the ""other side of the tracks""). It is in this last part of the film, that things tend to get silly, if not also needlessly confusing. Apparently, team members are being killed off by the ghost or the person that they ""done wrong"", although this is not handled well and sometimes it would seem that supernatural punishment is being merited out because people have survivors guilt.Scarlett figures out that the best way to escape hell is simply go back the way you came. Really? The entrance of hell should read, ""Abandon all hope, unless you are reasonably intelligent and willing to apologize."" Not only is it easy to escape hell, but fighting off Satan or cultist or supernatural killers (again, I am not entirely sure what is behind the killings) requires a simply apology.Also, given how long it took to make the journey into hell, it is impressive that Scarlett manages to VERY QUICKLY return to Flamel's treasure tomb and return the stone.In doing so, she gains magical healing powers (""but, can she turn stuff into gold"", some might ask).She also easily knocks down the Satanic stature -- which attacked George -- causing me (and some other people in the audience) to laugh out loud.After being healed, George and Zed (who is apparently a saint, or simply never feels bad about anything that he does) easily escape from the Catacombs. The credit roll.The film, As Above, So Below shines brightest when the characters are ""above"" (read: not in hell). When the treasure hunting adventure into the dark Catacombs turns into some sort of descent into hell, things tend to get confusing, if not downright silly.","As Above, So Below"
266,rrikikiki,Shoulder acting,2,6 November 2020,I usually love low budget creative movies. This would have been better if the main actress concentrated more on her acting and less on making sure her shirt is always pulled down on one shoulder.,"As Above, So Below"
267,scatter_brained4,uh fricken mazing,10,9 September 2014,"I don't want to sound like I'm hyping up this movie, but man it's been a long time since I saw a movie that was this good. I was completely absorbed from beginning to end. When the characters were panicking, I was panicking.The dialog did seem kind of off at first, but it got really good once it came time for going to the catacombs. This movie was so creepy that I got goosebumps. I recommend that no one watches the trailer to be even more creeped out because the trailer has all the good parts. I like movies like this with some substance I guess. Room 1408 was one of my favorites too. It's full of supernatural moments and has references about alchemy, Egyptians, and history. The quality of the camera work was nice too even if it was the style of a documentary. I could clearly see what was happening. The story was top notch too. The main character, Scarlett, reminds me of the character from The Mummy, Evey. She's looking for a philosopher's stone that has power to heal. You guys just have to watch it, explaining it won't give it any justice.","As Above, So Below"
268,Awesomephant,"As Above, Not So Bad",7,8 October 2014,"//As Above, So Below// takes us to the eerie catacombs beneath Paris where a group of hooligans (some of whom academics) attempts to unearth the mythical Philosopher's Stone, which is seemingly able to turn base metals into gold and grant eternal life. As they delve deeper and deeper underground, the spelunkers realize that paranormal forces are at play here and their very own sanity and lives are at risk.If, like me, you are going to watch this movie with low/average expectations, then you will probably be pleasantly surprised. Yes, there is plenty of shaky camera and a few poor obvious jump scares (most seen in the trailer), but //As Above, So Below// does a great job conveying claustrophobia and hopelessness as the plot develops. A particular scene I'd like to mention to illustrate my point is when one of the characters (I will not reveal the outcome of the situation) becomes stuck in one of the underground passages. Said character attempts to free him/herself, but you can gradually see and hear the panic increasing in an interrupted sequence. Part of the character's suffering will likely creep into you as well. It was quite interesting and my favorite part of the entire movie.While a couple of plot points are left unanswered or even nonsensical, the acting is worthy of note, and that combined with the unforgettable, terrifying setting that is the Empire of Death should make //As Above, So Below// worth your time and money, IF you have at least a slight interest in the genre.","As Above, So Below"
269,moglindnone,Incredibly original in comparison to every horror movie coming out lately.,7,30 August 2014,"""As Above, So Below""I pondered this film for some time now. I've been trying to understand why it's done so poorly for the critics (not that that affects my opinion about a film). But I just didn't understand how we could have such stark differences in opinions about this film. I've heard it called, chiched, forced, just like all the other found footage films in this ""saturated genre"". And I thought none of those were true about this film. Save maybe ""forced"" in some moments.Where to begin with this convoluted breakdown. The film clearly had some absurd qualities. First and foremost is the painfully contrived female protagonist. A mid-twenties girl who is fluent in 4 languages and 2 dead languages and 2 PhD's. Oh and a black belt in Krav Maga. She was beautiful, adventurous, intelligent, brave. Really? Too much. Waaay too much. HOWEVER. I know why they did it. For the sake of the story they needed a character who could do all of those things. The solution to this would've been simply to cast an older person. But that wouldn't cater to the targeted audience. They needed a full cast of young 20 somethings. There were other small things that were a little far fetched. Like ""oh they conveniently had enough cameras for everyone and they never broke or got water damage."" Of course. For the sake of a film in this type of genre to continue that had to be the case. First I would like to debunk the myth that the ""found footage"" genre is saturated and overdone. Let me think of a couple memorable found footage films: ""The Blair Witch Project"".... ""Paranormal Activities"".... ummmm..... ""Cloverfield""? I mean that's really all that stands out to me, but I'm not an avid horror fan. Maybe ""Quarantine"". The point is if you wanna complain about over done genres maybe you should look more in the direction of ""If I stay"", or ""The Maze Runner"" and movies alike. Or Exorcism movies. Oh. My. Gosh. Talk about overdone. No other movie has beautifully meshed these two genres together. Historical-Mystery- Adventure and Horror. Maybe ""The Mummy"" but even that wasn't really going for HORROR. And maybe that's why I particularly enjoyed this film so much. I love the Historical adventures such as ""Indiana Jones"", ""Laura Croft"", ""National Treasure"". And they painted an idea that I don't think has been done a lot or very well. I've never seen a film that has painted Hell like they did. And I'm gonna be real, I was very creeped/stressed/scared. I think it's strongest point was it's middle act. It's build up to the finale was very well done. I continually had a sharp pain in my chest until the end. Also ""George"" was a pretty good actor. And the french people. Change the main girl and you've got a great movie. In the end my reasons for why I liked it so much was that it was a fresh horror, unlike.. oh... I dunno... the thousands of possession and exorcism movies that come out every freaking year. And the concept was really intriguing. As far as horror movies go? 9/10","As Above, So Below"
270,stampede187,Quite a journey... abandon all hope those who enter here!!!,10,22 January 2015,"This film is fantastic; an epic journey through hell to purgatory and back again. It is filled with mythology, history, adventure, faith, demons, torture, religious awakenings & the repentance of sins. I feel that anyone would enjoy this film if you like spooky, creepy horrors that make you think, as opposed to simply a blood and gore slasher.Although this film can be well enjoyed with no prior knowledge of revelations in the bible, if you have questions or are confused regarding the plot and ending, please, please go and have a read and then return for a second showing with new eyes!!! Reading revelations(even the 'for dummies' guides or similar) will help your understanding. I highly recommend reading Dante's Inferno/Purgatory/Paradise series and Milton's A Paradise Lost..... plenty of websites with short, summarised details.In these texts, on being banished from heaven, Lucifer vows to oppose all of God's creation and laws. This would explain the 'backwards' element to the film after entering Hell's Gate (as above, so below). The general random demons dotted around are definitely part of Hell, as are the loud noises and visions, intended to torture. In the Catholic faith it is believed that personal sin is paramount for your fate following death, and that those with a heavy burden of sins are destined for Hell and damnation. There is, however, the possibility to redeem yourself by repenting your sins. In purgatory are the souls of those who have either committed lesser sins or have guilt, or have not followed the correct path during life. They then have the chance to repent sin, allowing them to enter paradise (heaven).As an example, Papillon was still denying his guilt/sin for his involvement in a man dying in a burning car right until the end. This failed opportunity to repent sealed his fate in hell, whereas when Scarlett see's her father she repents her sin and acknowledges her guilt and sin surrounding his suicide, making him disappear and allow her to proceed. Zed and George also repent on being faced with their own sins, after which a leap of faith allows them to continue and be allowed to enter paradise.So are they dead at the end? no; I believe they return to Paris as they cannot yet enter paradise until they die. They have had a journey through hell and purgatory, been absolved of their sins and have most probably assured their entry into heaven following death in the absence of future sin. The relevance of the philosophers stone to me is having faith in a higher power, and having hope of redemption. There are many other subtle references to revelations that make the film worth revisiting.I rarely score a film a 10, however, taking into account the story, fantastic camera work, acting and a modest budget of $5 million, it really is worth it. If you enjoyed this film, then 'Jacob's Ladder' and 'Descent' should also be right up your alley :-)","As Above, So Below"
271,pajamawolfie,Tomb Raiding in Dante's Inferno,7,7 April 2018,"Saw this on cable several years ago (I'd never heard of it) and liked it enough to buy it. Re-watched it last night and decided to review it. Really good for what it is: a modestly-budgeted B-grade horror flick in an exotic location.Best reason to watch this movie: The catacombs. Seeing all those real skulls and bones is fantastically creepy. They've got to crawl through little tunnels clogged with human bones, digging through them to make space. Real skulls are embedded in the walls in patterns as decoration made by people hundreds of years ago. Knowing that they were the remains of dead people rather than props gave me an eerie feeling.Another reason to watch: If you've ever read ""Dante's Inferno"", you'll find plenty of references and symbolism to pick through. I had fun doing that. It made me want to learn a bit about alchemy too.Premise: A Lara Croft-type hires / convinces / drags three climbers, a cameraman, and her ex-boyfriend down into a secret passage in the Parisian catacombs to find the Philosopher's Stone. Things get supernatural really fast and everybody on the trip has some personal demon or sin they have to face, which often turns literal and actually kills some of them. But that's what happens when you literally go to Hell.The shaky cam footage gets tiring. There's an actual reason to film the movie this way: the characters illegally enter the catacombs on an exploration mission. (Plus, imagine trying to fit a camera crew down there.) Nevertheless, I wished they'd hold still for a minute.The characters? Scarlett has 4 PhDs, speaks 6 languages fluently, and has a black belt... and is under 30. Sure. Her ex-boyfriend can translate centuries-old Aramaic off of dimly-lit stone tablets and fixes church clocks in his spare time. Whatever. These revelations might have been a cue to not take this movie completely seriously. The cameraman and the three climbers didn't get much backstory, but what happens down in the cave gives you enough clues to guess about Papillon's and Benji's.The horror? It started out as creepy and tense, but once they get deeper into Hell, things went nuts. Then there were more jump scares, and one scene-I'll just say it involves fire-put it over the top for me and killed the creepy vibe that the first part of the movie had. By then, things are moving so fast, that you can't spend that much time on it and have to focus on the next horrible thing that's happening. Even after this tone-shift, I was still enjoying the movie.The puzzles and traps? There were some cool ones. Lots of collapsing ceilings and puzzle clues that relied on some sort of alchemy mumbo-jumbo. The archeologist usually solves them pretty quickly, but there are consequences the few times she doesn't. The end has some interesting symbolism to it, and might be a little corny, but it's not out of place given everything that just happened.So it's not ""The Descent"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" but I did find it entertaining enough to watch multiple times. I'll brush up on my Dante, check out some alchemy lore and watch it again.Film recommendation: ""Inferno"" (1980) by Dario Argento. It's not an adventure movie and the story makes less sense, but it has killer atmosphere. If you want more truly creepy stuff even better the beginning of AASB, check it out.","As Above, So Below"

274,bangarang-69383,One of the creepiest,9,31 December 2018,"I wanted to see this movie when it first came out years ago but I never got around to it. I looked at reviews and surprisingly a lot of them were negative. People were saying things like ""how can this girl have all this education at her age?"" blah blah and ""it's too religious"" blah blah. Despite all of that, I decided to judge for myself since I usually watch movies if they have over a 6 star rating.I was not disappointed. This movie had some of the best horror atmosphere I've seen. I felt the claustrophobia, I felt the menacing presences. It was like I was there. And I love how they set it all up without using jump scares at first because this way it wasn't cheapened from the get go. I genuinely was scared. I cared about what happened to the characters because we learned their personalities, their internal struggles. I especially love the Paris setting. It's creative and the parallel with the mythology and religious aspects were cool to see. I have never actually read Dante's Inferno but this movie and the explanations taught me a lot.The found footage genre was done well here. I think even though the 'expoloring deep cave' thing has been done before, this was more creative. In other movies, they encounter creatures but in this one the creatures manifest from the characters' minds. I really enjoyed it and I'd recommend it to horror lovers and those who want to feel what a creepy atmosphere is like.","As Above, So Below"

276,DeathWantsMore,One cliché on another.,3,15 December 2014,"Another movie from John Erick Dowdle, sadly it just rehashes old ideas from BWP, REC, his own Quarantine and some other movies.So whats wrong? A few stoned actors made this look even worse than it actually is, but worst part is that it just teeming with clichés.Lets count for a bit:1) Group of youngsters in the catacombs: check. 2) Instantly disappearing walls/exits without any reasons: check. 3) Possessed hobo lost in the catacombs long time ago: check.4) Spooky lady that haunts the party: check. 5) Blood instead of water (please stop): double check. 6) ""Deal with your fears and we'll survive"" type of thing: check. 7) Randomly appearing objects from characters fears: check.Well, there're many more then that, I just pointed out some really old and repetitive tricks. To top that - its not scary at all.Another thing here is that there's no explanation on why & what's happening followed by a mere happy end. That was just gross, if you ask me.Movie will probably make claustrophobic people feel uncomfortable at times, but other than that there are almost no scary/remarkable death scenes (well, one of them is kinda original, I have to admit) or moments.I'll give it 3 stars, since it's an atmospheric movie, but cant really say any other good things about this.Totally passable experience.","As Above, So Below"

This is by far not the worst movie that came out these last years in this genre! But it has several missing points in the story!First thing first, the idea was really cool and the image quality is very nice! The more these young people go beneath, more their ""inner fear"" takes the upfront and comes hunting them! This idea was cool too but the director should've told us that before the scene itself in order for us to feel the pain and understand it! The phone scene was useless because they only revealed the ""inner fear"" related to it at the end of the movie!For me the worst part of the movie was the final scene! I mean... Coooomoooooonnn! They went to the gates of hell and got away that easily? The last scene smells very bad the N°2 ""The return"" to come! If I didn't give this movie a better note, it's only for the Sh**y ending and nothing else.... If it was better, I would have given probably an 8 or a 9!","As Above, So Below"
278,patrick-568-387329,Deserves better than its current rating,8,27 May 2015,"Well, first of all, the plot is extremely similar to for example 'The Pyramid'. Not many points gained there. However, apart from the crawling through maze like tunnels and unknown rooms, this movie has the additional feature of mysticism, linking things to ancient myths. Yes,'The Pyramid' had that too, granted, but in a more limited way. This movie makes it more into a puzzle of some sort. Not the greatest movie ever, but it does keep you on your toes, and I believe that's what counts. Having being in Paris multiple times myself, and knowing that the catacombs are in fact real, does help to to make this movie look more realistic. All in all, I liked it, and I do feel it deserves more than its current rating. A good one to watch if you are in need of some thrill...","As Above, So Below"

As the team head further and further into the Paris catacombs, the scares get bigger and bigger. It leaves you wanting more, but if you love to debate the meaning of a film, you'll love this. For any big horror genre fans, I would highly recommend this movie.","As Above, So Below"

The 'Tomb Raider'/Indiana Jones/Da Vinci style quest was extremely interesting.
From here they fly to Europe after Scarlett narrowly avoids capture and cave-in, where they head into the French Catacombs.
This setting has been untouched within the horror genre and is ideal for this kind of storyline, however, the direction it goes in with the character's past mistakes coming back to haunt them was a bit weak.","As Above, So Below"

What a fantastic adaptation and inclusion of Dante's 9 layers of hell. The found footage aspect makes it all the more realistic and appealing, which really draws you into the movie more. I stumbled across this movie randomly, as I was searching for another fixation to my supernatural/horror movie addiction and was more than pleasantly surprised. Some of my other favorites include Oculus, The Exorcist, and the Insidious series. Movies that focus on the supernatural that also present an intense psychological twist. As Above So Below really personifies the supernatural element while also bringing a historical aspect to it, making it all the more real. Overall I highly recommend and wish they would make a sequel or more movies like this.","As Above, So Below"
284,us_2,Creepy and Interesting,7,2 February 2015,"As Above, So Below is not too scary of a film, especially for those who are accustomed to all-out fright fests. It's more of an adventure movie at first, with the history of the philosopher's stone and Paris catacombs. It felt like DaVinci's Code for the first half of the movie. The second half is where it gets creepy. Just the idea of being underground in a claustrophobic tunnel with no way out is enough to bring some into panic mode. And, don't forget to throw in the real- life skeletons of the dead. Or, the strange cult people with their eerie chant.There were a few moments that made you jump, and some suspense, especially the room with the dead Knight Templar. Towards the end of the movie, the scares seemed to be forced, though. Not sure what the cloaked figure was or what he was doing, aside from just hanging out. From the camera angle, you know something is going to happen with the statues in the wall.Loved the part where Scarlett comes back through the statue room and punches one in the face, instead of being ""oh no, I'm so scared."" Liked the ending where everything was flipped, too.Wish they included more back story with the neurosis of the characters and why they were being haunted by their past. It was as if they forgot half of the story line.Overall, it wasn't that bad of a movie. It's a horror flick that you can watch with someone who hates scary movies.

288,reisenachjerusalem,Deserves more credit,8,9 June 2021,"This isn't like a lot of horror movies I've seen, it actually has more depth to it (no pun intended).The idea behind it is actually quite clever, with a group of people descending through the layers of Hell without realising it, and it's faithful to Dante's 'Divine Comedy'. As a History student, I liked this plot because it modernises the classic tale and even if you're not religious, you can take away the message that you need to rectify your sins and take accountability for your mistakes.There are a few small things that the movie could have executed better, for example why were people going into literal Hell dressed like they were about to head to the pub? The lead character, Scarlett also conveniently knew everything which made the movie lack a bit of credibility of me, and some of the horror effects were slightly cheesy and looked very low-budget.I was also somewhat underwhelmed with the ending, because the denouement of the film was too quick and it ended with the three remaining excavators escaping but as a viewer I still had many questions, and a minute long Q&A with Scarlett at the end was not fulfilling enough in my eyes.Overall the film is worth a watch, especially if you're looking for a horror film with a bit more substance to it, but the story could have been executed better because it's really interesting and I think the director rushed it a bit, leaving too much ambiguity by the end.","As Above, So Below"

The setup of the movie is promising as well, because the Catacombes can be quite scary. Therefore, a lot of ingredients for a good scary movie.Alas, it turned out to be nothing of the sort. A very far-fetched plot, predictable scares, and the overly shaky hand-cam which is past its prime were the culprits of my disappointment. Add to that some flimsy romantic love story, and you got a mediocre film at best.However, I do not want to give the impression that this movie was all bad. There were some pretty decent scares despite their lack of originality. I'm sure that if this movie would have come out ten years ago, it could have been a major hit. But after Blair Witch Project, Rec, and Paranormal Activity, it is difficult to insert a new angle into the whole hand-cam-genre.So if you just want a decent scary movie for 90 minutes while keeping your expectations limited, Catacombes would be a decent choice.","As Above, So Below"

Creatures and jumpscares definitely worked. What I like most about movies like this one: It creates a world that is unreal but still believable and the viewer can get lost in it. It definitely triggered my imagination and made me think more about that universe that was created here.Why only 6 stars then?

Otherwise, the acting was fair, although exaggerated somewhat to melodrama. There were also places where the camera appeared to get lost, then suddenly was in operation again. Other places where there was sound and no video - some stupid tactic at fright of blindness. The camera started out on the shoulder of the main actress, then jumped to some unknown person who was never acknowledged by the cast.

She is charismatic, driven, demanding and basically selfish and overbearing to the people who she goes to for help.The search through the underground Iranian tunnels is a good example of her character. Literally right before armies of the local faith bomb the tunnels, she finds what she is looking for. Then she puts her guide friend who had helped her in danger from both the authorities and the bombing as he frantically tries to take her back to safety. But she refuses to budge, until he's practically begging her to think of his family before she relents and let's him go. Yeah, she's not a nice person.She escapes with the information she needs and as she's retracing her steps in the tunnels, in the chaotic explosions that stun and disorient her, strangely she sees a man hanging by the neck above her in the tunnel, still struggling. She stops to say 'hello' as the man's body turns to her. Explosions happen, she turns and runs and never says anything to anyone about this vision.Cut to Paris. She is being interviewed by a documentarian who starts to film her adventure. She realizes she needs help translating the museum tablet inscription that the Rosetta stone inscription interpreted for her. She knows multiple languages but Aramaic is not one of them. She recruits her clock repairing ex boyfriend George who translates the table for her. It will tell her where the Philosopher's Stone is buried in Paris. That is what she's looking for. 
Per the inscription the stone is buried 300 or so feet below the streets near the catacombs in unofficial and unmapped tunnels. Given a tip by a strange young man seen briefly on a guided tour through the regular catacombs, she locates a trio of French adventurers Papillon, Zed and Siouxie who have explored the uncharted areas of the catacombs (having been there, yes, it appears just as claustrophobic as it appears in the film, especially if you are tall) in a French nightclub. There is a strange woman who exits the club as they are entering, then is caught on the documentarian's camera circling the club, staring at the group but this is ignored and never brought up again.They succeed in getting down to the secret entrance to the catacombs where things immediately start to go wrong. Accosted by the police right before they enter, the three French spelunkers throw smoke grenades and escape into the tunnels, dragging along Scarlett's ex boyfriend George who had adamantly refused to go with her on this trip due to an earlier trauma.The group reaches a fork in the tunnels after passing a weird chorus cult of women singing by candlelight in an ante chamber. They keep singing their strange song, unnerving the group. The spelunker leader Papillon says he knows the way via a pile of bones heaped under a crawlspace near the ceiling. The documentarian Benji balks at crawling over bones. Papillon insists that it's the way to go. Scarlett sees a perfectly good tunnel to their right that is partially sealed whose path she traces on her map would cut hours off their trip. Papillon adamantly refuses to go that route, and tells the tale of people who have gone that way who have never come back. He relates the tale of a man named Le Taupe who lived down in the catacombs for years. Then he could no longer resist the siren call of the cursed path, and finally left to explore it. That was 2 years ago and no one has seen him since. Scarlett thinks it's silly, but relents and follows Papillon and the others by the other route. They squeeze through but Benji gets stuck, panics and after a while - the scene goes on much longer than it should, but it gives you time to feel Benji's desperation and irritation at Scarlett's nagging voice - is able to struggle through, but causes a roof collapse.Now things start to get weird.They escape the collapse and find themselves right back where they started. Papillon is freaked out saying this is not where they should be. He explains that they should be in a straight tunnel after passing through the crawlspace but they're not. Undaunted by this strangeness, Scarlett says they have no choice now but to continue using the tunnel that no one returns from. And so they enter.They don't run into zombies or crazy men with knives or weird cannibal troglodytes, but they keep having disturbing experiences and each level forces them further and further down. After I watched the movie, I read the reviews and realized this was a modern version of Dante's Inferno. The seekers are basically descending into Dante's hell and each of the group are tested and either punished or not.I'm glad I watched this film as it is head and shoulders above most horror type movies lacking slashers, gore and fornicating teenagers. But I do admit, never having read Dante's Inferno, that I completely missed the references and 3 levels before the end, I grew impatient with the constant tunnel travel and hit my fast forward button. It ends much like Dante's Inferno does, surprising me yet again as I hadn't caught the reference and doesn't resort to cheap gotchas afterwards. I do recommend it and the real Paris catacombs (they did film this movie there).","As Above, So Below"
296,JFPouncey,"Enjoyable, but seriously, come on Universal.",7,19 November 2014,"**slight spoiler** Alright so I want to point out one of my biggest pet peeves about this movie straight away. In the scene where the ceiling falls on girl #2 and her arm is hurt, girl #1 gets the ""magical red rock"" and scratches it over her arm and suddenly heals. What kind idiot wrote this story? Seconds after the girl finally gets the rock of eternity, she all the sudden knows that if you scratch the rock over a wound, it heals? Modern horror is such a sham..What happen to writing legendary movies like ""The Hills Have Eyes"", or ""Halloween""? ----Overall the story line was original, but the cinematography was NOT original, at all. This will not, and I must emphasize on the word NOT, become a movie that people will remember for the next 10 years. The ONLY truly scary moments were the inclusions of pop-up faces, and loud horn-screech type sounds, which has become the normal in today's society in horror movies. Sucks man..-----If you're a horror fan, then you will enjoy it for sure. As long as you don't over analyze it like me lol.","As Above, So Below"

I was incredibly surprised right front the get go with this one. The acting was refreshingly spot on. I was actually impressed with in the first 15 min just because of that. All of the characters were very different and solidly written and performed. Additionally the plot in its own right will capture you and draw you in with deep interest. Even if you're not big into horror flicks, and granted this one is pretty thrilling, I think overall it would be enjoyable for anyone who likes edge of the seat suspense. Anyway, I'd defiantly put it on my top 10 maybe even top 5 best horror flicks. Watch it, you won't regret it!","As Above, So Below"

It will either have you on the edge of your seat, or off to take a bathroom brake without pausing.The opening scene of this movie is full of good intent but left me feeling confused. And not in the good way, but more in the way that makes you think that this movie is going to be just as bad as you expected.The rest of the first half of this movie is extremely basic setup. It does absolutely nothing to innovate, captivate, or even make you care about who, what, when, why, where or how. Meet the characters, make them seem young and hip, and as always, convey that they are way out of their league.All of this made me want to turn off my TV and call it a day. But i decided to stay and it was well worth my patience.As soon as the characters enter the tombs, the movie picks right up. Making me feel like i'm stuck down there with them and all of their fears being exploited left me as a paranoid wreck through the rest of the film.The movie isn't that scary, but more intense than anything.The ending was well thought out and not cliché. It also left me wanting more movies that are written with this much thought.","As Above, So Below"

What a terribly transparent movie - like a big automaton that marches on without any reason. I felt it was so awful because, in the end, there were some really strong ideas throughout, some genuinely creepy things. But enough with ""found footage"" - let it R.I.P. FOREVER, please.I didn't give a damn about Scarlet or George or whoever else the writers decided to sacrifice to the scary movie gods - boring-ass characters. Watching this movie was like going to Knott's Scary farm, stuff just exists to scare you and we'll tie it in with some guilt stuff that these people carry around and bang, formula for terrible movie.Also, for the first time in the history of ever, I actually got motion sickness watching this ""found footage"" shiftiest. And I've seen them all and never got the MS once. Kudos, AASB, kudos.But, there is some imagery throughout, some nice atmosphere the movie creates and that works well but its just too deep int the mucky-muck to rescue this garbage.The last shot though, or rather the final scene at the end is very well filmed and actually had me tripping out trying to decipher the physics of it.too long, didn't read - trite over-intelligent characters, scary stuff pops out, spooky sounds equals really bad scary movie. Watch The Descent Instead.","As Above, So Below"
304,marcomaryred,Boring start - interesting middle - abrupt end,7,13 April 2017,"After the last scene the movie left me with a sense that it could have done so much more with very little extra effort. The pretext for the events is extremely bland and just as unrealistic as some of the tings the main character say to each other every now and then, while the two main actors are presented as a poor imitation of Lara Croft and Nathan Drake which again I wasn't a fan of. But apart from that and the fact that quite a few things are told other than shown it's a good horror movie. The middle is jam packed with really unusual visuals and ideas, most of the times quite well executed. All in all a surprising and entertaining movie that I would definitely suggest to a fellow horror movie fan.","As Above, So Below"
305,alvelaisa,Overall a good descent into something new,9,28 August 2014,"While a part of me wishes to dislike the film for attempting to insult my intelligence on a couple occasions, I cannot help but applaud it for its ambitious nature. Not since the Mummy have I seen a movie that blends its use of historical adventure (not unlike Indiana Jones or Laura Croft) seamlessly with its horror elements. I wouldn't compare this movie to the descent, nor any typical found footage film, as it does well enough to stand on its own two feet. The cast is decent, never boring the audience but sometimes failing to make us follow their logic. The set pieces are grand, and from the first floor to its hundredth you might actually believe the wonderfully crafted fiction that compliments it all so well. Overall this movie is well worth watching for anyone looking for the thrills and chills associated with the history of the Paris Catacombs, provided they suspend the insatiable appetite to ask ""why?""","As Above, So Below"
306,aldi-97,One of the most interesting horror movies I have recently seen.,9,25 December 2014,"As you may already know if you have seen this movie, it is not predictable at all, even though everything is involved in an ""Hell Atmosphere"" which is presented in the title. However, I found this movie quite similar to a masterpiece, as it is totally interesting and relevant, what leads us throughout different mysteries that evokes the characters' past lives, recreating horrible situations they have already gone through. If I had to mention a drawback, I would say that some minutes after finding the stone, the movie tend to be a little amateurish. Nevertheless, after that part everything turns and becomes totally interesting again, you want to know the truth, you want the movie to finish, so everything will be revealed. Won't it?

Although this film isn't in absolute one of a kind, it is quite the film. It has the power to give you the chills, yet warm your heart. Horror films aren't ones with moral value, but this movie has something we can all take home. Many go into horror films for the pain and despair of it (I like to be one of them from time to time) and if that's all you want from a horror flick this is not for you. Although I will be recommending all my friends to see this film, I will especially recommend it to friends that aren't fans of horror for the pleasure of speaking of what makes this film stand out from just any horror film we've seen the past year or two. Definitely will make my weenie hubby watch this when he comes back home!","As Above, So Below"

311,elchinator,Can't recommend it,3,23 November 2014,"The story isn't really original. Take some ""Indiana Jones"", add some ""The Descent"" and mix in a little ""Blair Witch Project"" and you're done. But it would still be watchable. IF it wasn't such a complete shaky mess! It is simply impossible to watch this movie without getting motion sickness! The camera is swirling around like a fly on cocaine! Using a steady cam wouldn't give a away much ""realism"", as can be seen with other ""found footage"" movies. And speaking of realism: there are so many WTF?!? moments in this film. An underground structure is blown to shreds right underneath a thriving village. Without affecting the topside at all! A man in his late 20s not only translates Aramaic fluently (which would be a feat for much older scholars), he also makes it rhyme! A guy pops up in the catacombs after missing for two years. But no one even wonders how he survived there for so long or why he isn't irritated by the bright headlights! So all in all this could have been a descent horror movie (pun intended), but it simply isn't.","As Above, So Below"
312,luvlethalwhites-649-163984,I love it!,9,1 April 2019,"Personally, this is one of my favorite scary movies. I don't really put it into a ""horror"" category, but definitely a scary, supernatural-based movie. I love the story line and found the acting and script to be above average. I think it's a movie that was seriously under-rated. A mix of some historical facts along with where people's minds will take them when put in frightening situations definitely puts this into one of my top 100 movies. There are a few ""yeah, right, that wouldn't have happened"" with some of the logical scenes. For example (** minor spoiler alert ahead **), when the group has rappelled down their 2nd hole, the least experienced person would never have been left at the top to be the final one to rappel (I am a retired climber and caver, which is also why I enjoy this movie). That decision had some serious consequences due to that characters lack of expertise in rappelling. That oversight in script is one of the things that irks me about the overall story line.For the most part, though, I love the movie. I would also love to see a follow-up movie made about an attempt to return to retrieve the dead bodies of those the group was forced to leave behind. Bring back Perdita Weeks and Ben Feldman to co-star in the return.","As Above, So Below"
313,ajdthree3,An interesting premise turned generic horror romp...,6,22 April 2015,"""Indiana Jones"" meets the horror genre would be the best description of this one. The premise is interesting, and the use of ancient history (however accurate it may be) is a nice catalyst to building the plot. Other than the mindless scenarios that films like these often put into play to begin the same old routine of dumb character decisions and generic scare tactics, this one at least gave the impression that they put some thought into the creativity of the scripts premise as well as some ambition in the dialogue at times.For me the historical accuracy of these Paris caves are unknown, but for this film they serve as a greatly eerie and believable setting for what could make a fun horror flick. The dark and endless tunnels are as creepy as intended, while the group maneuvers through many claustrophobic locations in search of a 'missing piece of history'.Unlike other films similar to these the cast in this one was relatively good, Their performances were solid, the casting seemed to hit the mark as the group of young adults of varying backgrounds all come together for seeming realistic enough reasons. Perdita Weeks was good as the lead in this one and made this a better film then it could have been with her delivering a capable performance that also gave the impression of a film that took itself seriously.There was minimal backdrop to any of the characters but you are given just enough to understand the motivation behind their venture into the caves. The writing was decent and better than most horror films like this where you can see the outcome of the story almost before it even begins. This one delivers a compelling enough first- act and the seconds starts out good but it doesn't take long before you can start to feel where this story wants to go.While the script progresses the moments seems to get all too familiar and this is where the film begins to blur with the countless others. The films plot, revolving around spirits that feed on your innermost secrets and deepest fears has been done to death and this time around seemed too recycled. While this film had my attention early on, as well as some nicely developed intrigue, as it continued I often found myself not focusing on the story-line anymore so much as thinking back to other films this one was starting to reminded me of.Sure there were some good moments in this film that did rouse some thrills and even a couple jumps but as a whole package to vest an hour and a half on, there is better out there to watch. This one did show some bursts of creativity but it faltered as it went on and in the end it felt - unmemorable. If you are into the premise of this film I would suggest the 2011 horror/thriller called ""The Tunnel"", it was a bit better than this and will certainly deliver much more of the edge-of-your-seat chills you will be looking for and much more suspense.Another ""AJDReviews"" critique.","As Above, So Below"

315,bfreeproductions,A mind-numbingly stupid experience,3,28 August 2014,"Last night 8/27/2014 I attended a free advance screening of this flick. I am so glad I did not waste my money. From the very beginning, it is ridiculously stupid and nonsensical. I am really not a fan of the ""found footage"" gimmick anyway, or horror flicks in general (besides The Shining), so maybe I am just not the right audience for this movie. I was constantly laughing out loud at the stupidity of the characters, awful dialog, inconceivable premise, all things that were NOT meant to be funny. There was ONE legitimate jump scare, some pretty good locations and sets, a couple shocking moments with some alright blood/gore, but other than that, this movie would be a complete waste of money, in my opinion. Maybe a horror junkie or a fan of the shaky-cam, ""found footage"" sub-genre of films might enjoy this, but I highly recommend you save your money for something much more original and not so incredibly idiotic and cringe-worthy in all the WRONG ways!-B. Free.","As Above, So Below"
316,spiral_nemesis,Pretty good. Much better than expected.,7,31 August 2014,"First of all, there aren't a ton of good Horrors out there that are truly original. I'm not saying this movie is one of them, but that lack of originality shouldn't be the reason to give any movie a lower score. Bringing fresh ideas to the Horror genre is difficult, mostly because it's difficult to find new ways to scare people. There aren't a ton of moments that make you jump, but I think the genre isn't really about making people jump anymore. Audiences have gotten good at predicting when these moments happen.Where this movie does well, along with the rest of my favorite horror movies, is atmosphere. For me, having a dark, creepy atmosphere is far more important to success in this genre than getting people to leap out of their seats. The shaky-cam, found-footage style isn't that much of an issue for me either. Actually, I think still does a good job portraying realism, despite being a bit disorienting and annoying.Story-wise, I'd say it's pretty unique. How many other horrors involving descent into the earth to find historical relics can you think of off the top of your head? One, two maybe... How many horrors can you think of off the top of your head involving a haunted house, a possessed child or doll, exorcism, a guy with a mask, or a cabin in the woods? 100? Not to say this is bad, but I'll gladly welcome anything outside traditional horror settings and scenarios. It does dip into the realm of ridiculousness as some points, but nothing too over-the-top and far-fetched for the situation. The acting is good and the characters are believable for the most part. I would have cleaned up the final act a little bit more, but it was good enough to keep me satisfied.Not sure what the critics are bashing it for. If there is anything to really complain about it's not this movie, but the genre itself. That being said, lower your expectations and you might like it. I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.","As Above, So Below"

I thought that the main protagonist tried to hard to be like Lara Croft. All though, I enjoyed the film it felt like a horror version of the Da Vinci Code at some points. The way that the film has been filmed is very clever. They use the ""handheld camera"" trick, that they use in the Paranormal Activity series and in the Blair Witch Project. Although this film did a lot better job than most films that I have seen use it. Also I would love to hear more about the main girls dads back story more. I'm sure that it would of made the film just that much better even if it was only slightly touched. Overall a good horror movie that I would recommend to my friends","As Above, So Below"
318,richardneill,Entertaining but far from perfect.,6,29 November 2016,"I'm sure I'd have enjoyed this film more if the volume hadn't been used for cheap scares. If a pink, fluffy bunny wabbit jumped out of the shadows there would still have been potential for a coronary. The dialogue would be barely audible then out of nowhere it would sound like a bomb had been dropped next door. I turned the surround sound off after half an hour as it was simply unbearable, it really did spoil the film for me. The story was interesting enough but alchemy and the philosophers stone were maybe a bit too ridiculous to be believable. I felt the same about the last Indiana Jones film - the aliens element was just not believable enough when compared to the lost ark - not sure if the ideas made a difference or if it was the execution that made or broke those films (and this one). The characters were all likable but again perhaps a little far fetched - this is maybe harsh as the following did not detract any appeal from the main character but it felt hard to believe a 20 something public school girl who's spent most of her adulthood studying could really be so worldly wise and come up with all the answers. She also reeked of tomb raider, she really was a Lara Croft clone. Not altogether a bad thing and it would not surprise me if that was not an accident. If you can put some cotton wool in your ears then this film is still worth a watch.","As Above, So Below"
319,ChillSeaTry,Good actors; realistic dialogue; avoids most clichés; some irritating camera-work/old-hat effects,7,11 March 2017,"I'm actually pretty impressed with this film, for what it is! Ultimate takeaway: an attention-holding flick for folks who enjoy character-focused horror-lite (like me) and don't want a pure repeat of something they've seen before-- and not for people looking for a start-to-finish gore-fest. The conversational dialogue is realistic, and the actors' expressiveness is on point. How often do horror directors exert the patience and wisdom to let the film breathe, with pauses and (semi-)realistic pacing, and the script writers and horror actors show the chops and patience to communicate through normal everyday banter, pauses, interruptions, and silent expressions? Usually there's a lot of rushing-on-to-the-next-canned-line and giving-blank-stares or over-the-top- exaggerated-grimaces (although there was some of that once we got to the 'scary' parts of the film). I was genuinely impressed by the lead actors in this one, to the point that I'd like to see them succeed in more mainstream cinema/TV. They each had a presence I'd enjoy seeing again (I'm thinking Scarlett, George, and Papillon). The setup is patient, and really allows you to settle in to the characters (even if, as other reviewers have pointed out, they're a little unrealistically 'perfect', what with their multiple degrees and multi-language fluency and 'Krav Maga' skills, on top of their youth and runway-model good looks) and hand-held-camera documentary ambiance before revealing a premise that I otherwise might have bailed on immediately (they're looking for the ""Philosopher's Stone""? Really?) It is a credit to the dialogue writers, director, and actors that they carried this premise without reverting to a complete cheese-fest. Another credit to the script and direction: When warned of a dangerous mystery tunnel from which no one ever returns... the crew doesn't go in! Of course, a plot contrivance forces the crew to enter later anyway (I barely feel like that's a spoiler: this is a horror movie)... but still! It's through legitimate forced-choice, not arbitrary character recklessness.In general, there was increased predictability and cliché once they got into the doom-tunnels. Protagonist girl has amazing catastrophe-proof makeup; characters fall into a couple obvious traps; predictable jump scares ensue. Camera shots constantly cutting to black and jumping around in a way that the headlamp cameras surely shouldn't. Within the world of this universe, I was left curious about how far the reach of the supernatural forces is supposed to go. Usually, there's a barrier past which horror movie characters have to stumble-- a 'misstep' that warrants everything that happens next. But in this film, the characters make the correct (first) choice; they stay on a path that at least some of them have already traveled many times before. And yet they end up forced, by supernatural intervention, into the hell dimension anyway. In fact, elements of the hell dimension have already appeared aboveground well before the characters even embark on this exploration (e.g. the staring girl outside the club). Was the doom just inevitable? If they hadn't gone underground in Paris, would the club bathroom have just transported them to the hell dimension instead? I was left wondering about the actual mechanisms and phenomena we were watching on screen-- but not necessarily in a way that made me feel the movie 'cheated'; more like, there was more to discover than what we actually saw (since it wasn't all laid out for us in exposition). Ultimately, I was pleased and found the overall quality relatively fresh and professional for the genre. There were a few heavy-handed moments, I didn't like the cameras constantly cutting to black, and I wasn't altogether impressed with the horror-specific effects (except for the demise of the first character-- wow. Simplicity is definitely the way to go, in my view) but for the most part they avoided over- explaining everything (and I think leaving the audience with a few questions to ponder can be a good thing).Not necessarily a classic, but I think there's a lot of good stuff to appreciate in here, for folks like me who watch a lot of horror movies on Netflix! Based on this film, I'd be genuinely interested in seeing what else this director, and the 3 lead actors, come out with.","As Above, So Below"

I found it to be equally terrifying and entertaining. I hate small spaces so it really challenged me to watch this, and I liked that they played off that fear that many have. The movie made me feel something, and that's what I aim for when evaluating a movie. (Not speaking of feeling of hatred either toward said movie) But I really think it was worth a watch, and I had very low expectations going into it.

My cousin then told me that I was stupid and it's a brilliant movie based on Dante's Inferno, and then gave me her copy of the book to read. I read it, and loved it, so I rewatched the movie and holy crap. Everything made a lot more sense. And everything just... connected. In all, the movie alone is decent as a horror movie. It's got good story, good, believable characters. Good acting and writing. But reading Dante's Inferno and then watching it, it becomes a masterpiece. Definitely one of my favorite movies out there.","As Above, So Below"

330,GuanXing,Worst cinema experience of my life.,1,15 September 2014,"I went to see this movie in a theater with a friend of mine. What attracted me in the synopsis was the fact that it took place in the Paris catacombs and the similarity to The Descent plot-wise. I had loved The Descent. Now, unfortunately, I wasn't aware that the movie had been filmed with the 'shaky camera' effect. If I had known that, I would not have bothered going. After less than 5 minutes watching the movie, I started feeling nauseous because of all the shaking. At the time the characters reached the catacombs, I had to keep my eyes closed to prevent myself from getting sick. I only stayed in the room because we had paid and my friend didn't feel as bad as i did. After the movie, it took me about 10 minutes to feel better and my friend, who had watched the movie fully, used the word 'terrible' to describe it. Overall, it was a big disappointment and the worst cinema experience of my life.","As Above, So Below"

I guess it's like when a drug user gets used to their dose and has to keep doing a larger one. I'm that way with horror movies.That being said, this was decent, but not at ALL scary.If you want to actually watch a tense movie I highly recommend Grave Encounters.

332,bshaffer940,Decent movie for the overplayed genre,6,2 January 2015,"As above so below is another found footage film with a decent story line but a lack of scares to hold audiences. The biggest problem with this movie is the recycle of things seen in other found footage films and a lack of explanations that will leave you scratching your head. I was looking forward to a re-visit to the catacombs after the last movie I saw that referenced them called ""Catacombs"" left me saddened by the lack of effort. I expect this movie to soon be on netfix, so I say save your money and wait for the stream cause it's not worth the 1.50 at the redbox. If this movie had maybe 20 more minutes it could of provided the explanations needed to make better sense of the movie instead of rushing through the scenes like they did. Going forward, I will have lower expectations from this genre as it seams nothing original is left in Hollywood.","As Above, So Below"

Overall a very movie. P.s don't mind other reviews a very good movie. I am the type of person that looks at one review which says zero stars and all the other reviews are higher but gets worried that it would be rubbish, but you actually don't need to do this on this exact movie, because this movie is very good. :).

334,garushia82,"Good, but could've been better",7,18 February 2016,"Let me start out by saying é don't like ""jump scare"" horror movies, not because they bother me or anything, I just think they're a cheap trick, and this movies tries resorting to this a few times, unsuccesfuly. Good horror movies, from me, are the ones that manage to build up strong suspense without actually showing you anything violent, supernatural, creatures behind doors or anything of the sort. That said, one of the scariest part in this movie is when a character gets a panic attack from being stuck in a tight passage. For a movie that literally takes you on a ride to hell, this is clearly a fail.Even though AA/SB is not an excellent horror movie, it still does a decent job at it. It's also a good and original ""found footage"" film, and it does a great job at introducing the main character, making most of her actions very believable. The rest of actors are between OK and good.About the characters, half of them are very underdeveloped, and at a few points, the script made some of them look very unrealistic. As a viewer, you know what's going on, you know where this is going, and at a certain point in the movie, it wouldn't matter how skeptical you are about anything, you would start to heavily question your beliefs, and you would react to it. However, they never stop to talk about it or admit their situation, nor do they show it. If you were just a young explorer, you would certainly have a clear reaction upon knowing you're descending into hell.I also think the ending should've been at least more ambiguous, did they actually get back to Paris, or did they just get into another layer of hell? That would've been a great ending. Alright, so a lot of people died, no treasure was taken, it's not exactly a happy ending, but it also seemed like the way out was too easy.","As Above, So Below"

336,xxxsarahmariexx,Excellent-Much better than I expected,9,22 June 2019,"I chose this flick thinking it was a first-person version of The Descent, and assumed it'd be full of death and weird creatures throughout. Boy, was I wrong! It was completely different than I expected, and I liked it even more!
All of the characters are brought to life with incredible acting, and I felt all types of emotions from their experience in this thrilling horror. I even got to the point where I had certain characters I PRAYED wouldn't die, and this film put me on an emotional roller coaster nearly killing off my favorite guy. George And Scarlett's relationship grew closer as their lives became more in danger, and I loved that. Of course, the whole time I thought ""They're going to kill him off-I know it!"" and it was a nail-biter watching George's near death when Scarlett practically left him and Zed to die.
I'm normally not one to shy away from ""scary scenes"" but there were a couple of moments I cringed and looked away, especially watching this after dark, and I can say that this film gave me the minimal jump scare, the excitement, the mystery, and the entertainment I was looking for.
I'd give it 10/10 except I'm not the biggest fan of POV movies with the shaky, first person camera. This is one of the only ones I could stand! Normally I'd get a headache and turn it off!","As Above, So Below"
337,jamnique,"Mystery, adventure, horror. Done better than most found footage flicks.",7,20 February 2015,"This review might contain mild spoilers for the first 15 minutes of the movie or so.I'll try to keep this short. If you're totally allergic to ""found footage"", shaky cam films, this probably isn't for you. That said, it isn't your typical shaky cam flick either. It uses elements of found footage films, but it does so effectively and without relying on clichés. Sure, if you pick it apart piece by piece you will find a fair deal of the typical found footage tropes in some form or another, but they serve their purpose and aren't detracting attention from the story. Also the movie is, IMHO, shot very well and the cam isn't THAT shaky.The thing I loved the most about this movie is the buildup, pacing, adventure and mystery. The main character is a Lara Croft-esque, light- hearted archaeologist who enjoys living on the edge, and, following in her deceased father's footsteps, is on the verge of discovering a hidden Philosopher's Stone. That's what the movie focuses on. There are scares, but it tries to rely on building tension and developing the story rather than cheap tricks and running around screaming.At this point I have to say I was really unimpressed by Descent. It was a mediocre movie to me, focusing on jumps scares, grotesque and violence, and neglecting to tell any meaningful story. This movie, is the other way around. So, if you really loved Descent, and expect this to be like it, you might be disappointed (fewer direct ""nerve-wrecking"" action moments). On the other hand, if you like Indiana Jones and found footage / horror you should enjoy this as much as i have.","As Above, So Below"
338,heroicconman,Female explorer goes to find the a legendary rock but ends up finding something much much worst instead,3,8 September 2014,"I knew this movie was going to be bad just by watching the previews, but my friend insisted we see it; boy was I right. A lot of the movie seemed to have elements of other movies put in to it. Then the story of the philosophers stone was thrown in there as a way of making them go down to the catacombs,to find that its the gates of hell and that they must face there own personal demons that haunt them or by the random other demons that are not explained about at all, such as random ghost, grim reapers, and stone demons. When you think that all hope is lost for the team; they find a random manhole back to the real world, when it was saying that everything was just upside down in the first place, yet where was the manhole when they were making there way to the stone weren't they in hell now how could there be a real world, I was expecting something like the movie Constantine where hell is just a fiery waste land of earth but nope just the real world again, no explanation necessary I guess? When the credits started to role I was in amazement how they could just end it like that, with nothing to be explained about what she was gonna do with her new found powers or if she even still had the power, and why they were simply able to escape so easily from the other side of hell. So all in all 3 out of 10 for this movie.","As Above, So Below"

341,b-bollinski,Best Found Footage in years,7,29 December 2015,"This is overall one of the best found footage movies I have seen in years.. The setting, the acting, the plot,.. . If you can predict this ending, you are one very special carrot. Now seriously, It's not the best movie ever made but it's definitely worth a watch. I was a fan of this genre until they beat us with it making the same sh!t over and over again. Even this movie does a lot of the ""regular scarings"" but it's different in a way. Maybe because catacombs are a creepy place to film it, for starters. Now this movie has a lot of goofs, and I mean a lot.. BUT some of them are actually funny if you think about it, another reviewer pointed some of them out (go read it!). ++SPOILER//+++Actually a lot of what happens in this movie doesn't get explained:What are those women doing at the beginning? And why would you freaking just watch for 3 seconds and walk by then...Why does the black guy who's filming this whole documentary killed by the woman? It were the personal demons whom were chasing you.. So I guess ex-girlfriend? What's the deal with The Grim Reaper? Actually, it's not Him, because first you see one in a weird looking wooden chair just starring at nothing, as the movie goes on in the end you see like 4-5 of them.. Guess: Demons? Who do literally nothing except chasing.. and are unbelievably slow..?Now, what bothers me is that none of them is freaked out about finding ""La Taupe""back in these catacombs, how did he survived? His clothes, the lights should have burned his eyes.. AND HE knows they way out.. SERIOUSLY?! He is there for FREAKING 2 YEARS...?Why did he killed that girl? He was starring at nothing, girl touches him and BAM he flips.. and kills her.. Personally conflicted demons..? No..? was't that the whole plot..? I could go on but i will not. Overall this is a good movie 7/10 I would recommend it to my friends and acquaintances.","As Above, So Below"
342,MelisabethKaplin,Don't waste your time,1,2 September 2014,"The catacombs is an eerie sort of place already, adding a horror movie to the mix seemed like a good combination but what it brought was the worst movie I've ever seen.I didn't expect the movie to be filmed via a video camera held by a character the entire duration but it was. When it was light enough and steady enough to see what was happening on the screen it didn't make much sense. There wasn't much of a plot, it was too unrealistic, and had a small resemblance to the movie National Treasure. The only scary scene was VERY short scene and made no sense at all as to why it even happened. If you get scared sitting through an hour and a half of feeling claustrophobic then this movie may be for you.The ending offered no explanation of what just happened or why it happened and ended pretty abruptly.I was happy when the ending credits starting rolling, although I was a little disappointed with the 93 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I saw this movie for a discounted price of $5 and I wouldn't watch this movie again even if it were free and gave me a puppy.","As Above, So Below"
343,pod-127-828284,Proper Scary,9,23 November 2014,"As with any genre of movie, there are different kinds of scary movies. Different types of horror. Different people will like different ones, and of course, some don't like scary at all.For me, As Above was a really good horror, best one I have seen in quite some time. It grips you and plunges you into a surreal universe, with its own character, atmosphere and rules. There is a screamer or two, but they are not the centrepiece, it's not a gimmick. The style is somewhat reminiscent of Dead Birds, or Cookers, or Tideland, or even Pan's Labyrinth, and of course Quarantine, John Dowdle's previous work; it's weird, spooky, very... small and intimate, oddly detailed and polished in places you don't expect it to be.It's the kind of horror film that afterwards makes you want to look under your bed, check that corner shrouded in darkness just to make sure there's nothing there, you know, just in case, that makes you turn the lights on in the hallway or stairs you always walk through unlit.I thoroughly enjoyed As Above, and recommend it to any fan of scary movies that make you uncomfortable.","As Above, So Below"

This movie was drop-dead AMAZINGLY accurate and the more the director took it as far as he did the more I was terrified. Think about it; You're watching a horror movie and all of the facts in the movie are true and from real recorded WORLD history. Just about every single turn of events was at a pivotal moment with a real, historically accurate twist. Amazing acting, amazing direction-NOT a ""found footage"" movie because the footage was never lost in the first place and I seriously can never get enough. Definitely one of those movies you have to watch something happy after because you have to try to go to bed and actually sleep. I always recommend this movie and always will.

Second time, I felt even more strongly that it was a great horror movie, but I noticed more.... Third time, I really started to see there was much more to it. Fourth time, I put together things like her answering the phone, and her issue with her Dad, and the kid who told her to find Papillion is the kid in the flaming car... That's when I really got interested. Now, I'm at viewing number 6? Hang on, Papillion is about to die....brb, that was cool. Anyway, I'm reading about the connection to the Dante's Inferno as I watch, and I'm realising this may be one of the best films I've seen. It's definitely in a handful of my very favourites. I'm going to find a good English translation of The Inferno to read because of this movie. A truly stellar film.","As Above, So Below"

The ONLY character that might continue going after all this is the lead chick- nobody else has any motivation to continue, and with each freaky thing that happens its more and more ridiculous that they would continue. I hate horror like this. Where the entirety of the story rests on poor writing. Instead of coming up with a reason why they dont say screw this im out- lets just make them continue on. People are not like that. Especially when there is nothing driving them. Treasure? Randomly promised by some stranger?  Any commentary on human fears, weaknesses or faults is made utterly pointless because the humans in the story are just shallow, poorly written/developed characters. There's no relatability, there's no ""hitting home"". And i find myself rooting for these idiots to die out of the frustration of their stupidity","As Above, So Below"

The hand-held camera work is still a very cool concept in my opinion and the filmmakers did an amazing job with this, primarily because they're actually in the catacombs of Paris! Let alone i thought the actors did a great job, and it was very believable and it the hand-held camera work made you feel like one of the characters experiencing the whole thing. No it was not the scariest movie of all time, no it doesn't have some deep meaning, but for the 9$ i spent to go see it, i absolutely loved it. Very cool movie in concept and it was done very well.

360,RenovatioSelcuk,Ordinary religious driven movie which tries to be scary,5,19 November 2014,"I do not have anything to add how ordinary movie is this. However, I personally dislike any movies which say bad things about any country, religion, group or person. In the movie, when the main character breaks into a church, she met a guy who is supposed to know a very old language. The guy does not like her because of some bad experiences in the past. When he was giving an example of such bad experiences, he talks about a prison in Turkey that they had to be kept for a while because of her. And she says 'it was not a prison but a jail'. Then he says 'jail in Turkey!'. Sorry but I hate such plots in any movies. So, can somebody tell me that is there any country in the world which have a wonderful, and beautiful jails that everybody wants to be kept? Any country? No. right! Jail is not a good thing. it does not matter where it is So, why the writer of this stupid ordinary movie decided to create such a stupid conversation and made a very bad impression about Turkey. Did the writer visit Turkey at all? kept in a jail there? I really do not understand what such writers are thinking when they write such things. When you watch most of the Hollywood movies including Turkey at some point, you will see very wrong, exactly the opposite of what Turkey really is. Turkey is not Iran. All the writers, mostly American, has to keep that in mind. And please be honest! I am personally fed up with these kind of movies. If you have not visited Turkey yet, please keep your stupid opinions about this country for yourself. Be fair for god sake! Turkey is a democratic, contemporary and secular country. Just an example; Turkish women had to have a right to vote or to be elected for the parliament way before than many European countries, e.g France. Additionally, Turkish women do not dress like Iranian women do. Yes there are some women like that in Turkey, but originally Anatolian women have their own style and young generation in Turkey do not dress like people who live in a (strictly-) religious country. I am not opposed to any dressing style whatsoever. BUT we have to know the differences which make us what we are or what our country is like. Hey you writers!!! read some history or visit the country before writing anything stupid or just be fair. You are acting like politicians who do things without thinking which I hate most. You are supposed to make art! so stick with it! best!","As Above, So Below"

But not this one. I wouldn't say that every aspect of it is completely original but the overall movie experience is. Its a must watch for horror movie lovers and who are looking for a movie different from your garden variety horror movies. More importantly it has a story which keeps you hooked till the end, the one thing that is mostly missing from horror movies which manage to provide a decent scare factor. So there you go, a storyline (which is missing from most horror movie), no obvious gore, decent scare element, good acting, good setting overall, and not exactly something you can watch without thinking too much.","As Above, So Below"
362,tacaloking,the movie isin the catcombs under,3,31 October 2014,the movie is a painful disappointment i feel the that the story is was destroyed this movie everything else i think they got right even the i think they needed to use a few things more they should of used the plague victims more and try and set a almost depressing feeling scenes like if they were walking next to a room and the characters saw rows of plague victims all lying around and dying slowly but i felt that the actors were good enough and the story was pretty interesting and it layed a field for unlimited ideas of how to entertain the viewers but the thing that destroyed it all was the story the plot wholes were the size of the grand canon and it made no sense and it lacked a ending that would explain why everything happen it felt lazily written like it only existed to sell movie tickets and nothing more i think the biggest plot whole is that they did not use the stone it would of been one thing if it was lost during the cave it but it wasn't so why did they not go back and use the stone to change the thing that was blocking there way into something else and if it failed then they would of learned the stone was a fake at first i was annoyed with the sakey cam and some times i felt it was to much but in the end result i felt it was well used and i feel the camera people did a great job in using it and i think a huge problem with the movie is that they did a half ass job in trying to make me understand what the hell was going on as far as i know it happen just because and because of that it took away from the characters and i feel because of that there was no chance for the actors to look all that good im surprise they did as good as they did considering what they had to work with at times i felt the main character wavered from a really good character to a stupid one and the biggest problem i found was when me and my mother were talking about the movie 30 minutes after watching it and neither one of us could figure out what male character survived which i feel is a huge problem but i would suggest watching this movie once just to see the effort every one put in to try and recover for the horrible writing of the movie because i think the camera men and actors should really be given credit for giving me some interested in the movie because i feel if this was put in the hands of a better writer the movie would of been a hit but sadly the only thing good about the plot is the beginning,"As Above, So Below"

Went In With Low Expectations - Came Out RAVING About It! 8.5/10,9,2 September 2014,"This movie is definitely not for movie goers who dislike ""Found Footage"" Or ""First Person Camera"" movies. Additionally it is not for movie goers who get easily sick or nauseous due to constant jerky moving camera shots... Well that said, I LOVED IT! I saw a short trailer for it online and didn't really understand too much about it except that it had to do with Paris's catacombs. I knew the movie was supposed to be scary and therefore i was expecting some sort of ghost or demon angle to it, but to my surprise the plot had MUCH more depth to it and was very intriguing. I found myself researching more about the theme, plot and background when i got home.Now i know some people have trashed this move just because Harry Potter did its own take on the philosophers stone first, therefore (IMO) tainting their ability to distance themselves from this movies original fresh take on it.... This is INCREDIBLY unfortunate, as this movie really takes a original take/stance and expands on it very well. It also incorporates numerous other cultures mythology throughout this process.For those who don't know, the ""Philosophers' Stone"" or otherwise know as the stone of the philosophers is a legendary alchemical substance said to be capable of turning base metals such as lead into gold or silver. It was also sometimes believed to be an elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and possibly for achieving immortality. For many centuries, it was the most sought- after goal in alchemy. This movie contains BOTH the gold angles as well as the elixir of life (And its healing abilities).I LOVED how it incorporated this with other different mythologies to really give the audience a its own original take on Hates (Otherwise Known as HELL) and the paranormal and then mixing it with a wild treasure hunt adventure. If you can get past the jerky camera movements, You will find yourself getting literally GLUED to the screen as it takes you a wild roller-cost ride throughout Paris's underground catacombs. These catacombs hold nearly SIX MILLION peoples remains!! This definitely gives the movie that extra edge because of the dark backdrop of skeletons and death at every turn of endless tunnels, The group often finds themselves having to climb through small openings literally littered from on top to bottom with piles of bones. The main characters are archaeologists, who also happen to be experienced treasure hunters.The quest like i mentioned above is for the Philosophers stone, this is what the Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) father had been searching for his ENTIRE life. **SPOILER** Her father is who you see in the beginning, (They both are in country in the middle east (Syria? or Saudi Arabia? Not remember..) But they are searching for a hidden wall that contains clues to where the stone is hidden. There is where he meets his death (Hung with a noose)... She then is determined to complete his life long quest. The movie is something of Indiana Jones mixed with National Treasure, It has hidden clues and messages that must be deciphered in order to advance to get to the next clue/phase/part. In the end, it takes them into the catacombs where an group of french friends leads them to the spot they believe the stone is hidden. This group of friends refer to themselves as the most experienced catacomb explorers and are essentially their ""tour guides"" . You (As the Audience) will experience paranormal activity, Hates (Hell), immortality, and a deathly adventure that claims the lives of many.... IF not ALL ;P... Well, i won't spoil that part! You will just have to go and find out!!!I would best relate this movie as a mix of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS and NATIONAL TREASURE. A unique mix of National Treasure type treasure hunt, BUT with a huge catch. This is where the The Grave Encounters paranormal vortex applies! Once the group enters the final phase by entering into the catacombs... there's no turning back home. The group discovers that the entrance of the tunnels of which they have entered, does not exist. They quickly learn that the only hope of survival is to push forward deeper into catacombs,,,, furthermore they eventually discover that completing the quest of finding the philosophers stone is there only means to not only survival... but their only means to escape the dimensional vortex.8.5 out of 10! Best scary movie I've seen in awhile!!","As Above, So Below"
365,codeblue0076,"Creepy setting, but would've been better without found footage style.",7,30 August 2014,"What happens when you mix The Descent, Grave Encounters, and Tomb Raider? As Above So Below! In comparison to this year's other found footage flicks (Devil's Due, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones), here we have slightly more interesting concepts thrown at the screen such as Alchemy, Archaeology, and of course the creepy setting of the Paris Catacombs, which result in a more entertaining film than the previous mentioned films. Some SPOILERS ahead!Pros: Sound Design- The sound effects, and soundtrack elements greatly help improve the tension and atmosphere. One notable element is the eerie chanting of Satan worshipers. Also there is a scene in which the audio becomes muffled and quiet, when they are moving through the water which is excellent.Great choice of setting- The Paris Catacombs are the PERFECT setting for a horror film, in fact, I'm shocked that there hasn't been a dozen other movies already made about them. The maze-like quality of the catacombs creates suspense, since anything can pop out of any corner.Authentic Production Design and Acting- Now I know a lot of this film was made in the real Catacombs of Paris, but many were sets as well. Mr.Dowdle does a fantastic job of joining the two seamlessly. Also, the acting/dialogue between the characters is actually pretty decent for a horror movie, which usually have overly cheesy and dramatic dialogue.Cons: The Shaky Camera - I think filming this movie with a first-person view,was unfortunately a mistake. The beginning especially starts off extremely disorienting, and you can barely see what is going on. The Descent was a great movie that didn't need to be a found footage movie.Jump Scares - The best ones are pretty much all spoiled in the trailers, with the exception of one or two.Character's unwise decisions- ""Is that bad?"", ""Let's go here"", ""Break that gate!"", you have seen it all before.Ending- What happens in the ending is not what I have a problem with, it is the tone. The ending was just too happy for a horror movie.CONCLUSION:As Above So Below was is a semi-solid found footage flick with a claustrophobic and creepy underground setting, and some interesting concepts up its sleeve.","As Above, So Below"
366,mickeyjdavies,Catacomb raider: The (unintentionally) hilarious adventures of Scarlet Croft,8,1 September 2014,"Precocious young female British archaeologist equipped with martial arts skills & mandatory posh voice (but this time without dual firing pistols) is off following her father's footsteps on an adventure to find an ancient mysterious artifact with fabled mystical powers.It leads her into raiding a tomb (the French catacombs in this case, hmm why is this starting to remind me of something?) where mysterious things start happening involving angels & darkness. Along the way we are shown evidence as to how brilliant she is, for example she is an expert in languages (can string together a couple of basic words in French) & has a Masters in Chemistry, somehow allowing her to clean stone relics & perform basic First Aid. She is joined by her equally nonsensical potential love interest who fixes ancient clock towers using watchmaker glasses as a hobby & naturally translates Aramaic into modern English poetry.So a little ridiculous then & not exactly original, but in this case that is part of it's charm. The movie continually sets up little sub plots that it is blatantly not going to do anything with, randomly introduces things that make no sense in order to lead to the next set piece & everything is done with such gleeful arbitrariness that I couldn't help but be charmed & highly amused by it.Ultimately if you're looking for a dark unsettling movie about the nature of death, regret & evil or a psychological shaky cam movie with monsters you won't find either here (I'd recommend revisiting The Others or Rec instead). On the other hand if you fancy some faintly ridiculous, fun, funny adventure with good old fashioned scary set pieces give it a try.","As Above, So Below"
367,hootonsrus,Could have been a REALLY GOOD movie but . . .,3,7 September 2014,"Could have been a REALLY GOOD movie like 7/8 star but . . . the whole movie was done in that ""documentary"" style where the camera is never steady it usually doesn't bother me but this movie was like trying to watch during an earthquake it was shaking constantly. There were several people that left the movie before it was over because it was so bad. Me & my friend LOVE horror movies (not gore) and would have loved this one but it was making us nausea (literally) we kept having to look away just to keep from getting sick, so that's why I rated 3 instead of 7/8. I REALLY hope producers get out of this habit of amateur or documentary style movies cause it really takes away from the quality of the movie. Great story poor filming.","As Above, So Below"
368,michschlueter,I had a great night at the movies,8,17 September 2014,"For me, as a fan of the horror genre, this movie was exciting. It had a great atmosphere, great ""soundtrack"" (there is no real music during the movie...but the sounds are disturbing) and a few jump scares. So me and my wife had a great time with AASB and so did the other people in the cinema. The first 30 minutes started slowly, but once they entered the catacombs the tension got stronger. It had a claustrophobic feel to it and when the survivors eventually reached the fresh air, I breathed with them and was happy that I left the catacombs. The shaky cam sucked from time to time, but overall it was OK. Yes, usually found footage movies these days suck, but not this one.","As Above, So Below"
369,myers-family,Interesting,6,4 October 2014,"Seeing this movie was the result of a boring night and a spur of the moment ticket purchase, but in the end, I was very happy I went. The movie may not be perfect and it may also subscribe to many of the clichés other horror movies subscribe to, but it does just enough unique and entertaining things to bring you along for the ride. The story revolves around Scarlett, an explorer looking for an ancient artifact rumored to be in the catacombs beneath Paris. I think this is the strongest film in the found footage genre, it's rare to see a film in this genre adopt a fantastical and almost fairy-tale-esc storyline, and roll with it, but I think this movie does it well. It may not be particularly scary at times, but I don't think it was meant to be. But for one thing, the sound design is a great, and when it's meant to be scary, it definitely is. So to cut it short, if you're bored one night and want to watch a decent little creepy flick, I'd recommend this.","As Above, So Below"
370,pamukprensesinkutusu,lost my interest in 10 minutes,2,25 November 2014,"Is this meant to be a horror or a thriller? I don't care if the characters went to a university in London, or a Turkish prison in Turkey ( nonsense continues since the midnight express!), this film is all over the place. A smart young lady with 2 PhDs and 6 languages searches for a stone that turns things into gold (very logical!) and what happens next is even harder to make any sense of...Totally sucks but well advertised and thus cheekily misleading.Obviously the film only cost 5 million dollars to make. This is even 'belower' than some of the budget movies I have seen in the past years. Universal Studios must have made a fortune from this low budget movie but I am not impressed at all. Wasted my money and time!","As Above, So Below"
371,angelav-44055,Awful confused film,1,22 June 2015,"Good job I had read some details about this film before I saw it, else I would have had no idea what was going on. Terrible film especially when it got to the ""personal"" demons section with the burning car scene...also what were the guys in the wall all about ? & random women appearing behind one of the guys before he fell down the well and got killed. Also the re-appearance of a man who had gone missing ages ago and was assumed dead, where did he fit in.Overall a jumbled disjointed film good job I had not paid to see it saw it on sky go. so I could stop & go back to some bits and review what had happened.","As Above, So Below"
372,stufer-20213,A strong and original horror film,7,8 August 2015,"Really enjoyed this film, as something of a fan of the horror genre in general. Give it a little time and engagement, and this film should be a fun ride for those who like horrors that are a little different from the norm. I must confess I have a soft spot for any horrors that have some element of mysticism and esoteric ideas. To be honest, they were not fully developed (a small weakness) in the film and story, but what can you expect from a feature length fairly lowish budget horror. It makes you think at least, and the ending may be subdued, but again leaves you thinking. There are some classic 'creepy' elements in the film (shadowy figures etc) but the setting and progression are less copied from other films than most are. Overall, if you want something a little different and like horror, give this a go on a dark night.","As Above, So Below"
373,stevemooregraphics,"Like 'The Tunnel', but better",7,13 October 2015,"This film was a bit of a revelation, and certainly one of the better horror films I've seen in years. Yes, it's a found footage film, but it doesn't feel cheap or contrived in any way. In fact the camera work is incredibly effective in building suspense and there is a real sense of claustrophobia throughout the film. It's very similar to 'The Tunnel', so if you enjoyed that you'll like this, in fact this film is much better in my opinion.Plot wise it's decent enough for a horror, but does go a bit 'National Treasure' at some points, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who kept thinking about Harry Potter when they kept talking about the Philosophers Stone. The scares build throughout the film and it's more creepy suspense rather than leap out of your seat moments, although there are one or two jumps thrown in there. The location itself works great in the film, and this could almost work as a 'potholing gone bad' film and still be a very tense watch. In terms of characters it's pretty good all round. The lead actress is fairly annoying but apart from that everyone else did a decent job.Overall, definitely worth a watch, even for a non-horror an like me!","As Above, So Below"

375,moley_molo,Couldn't finish it...,9,6 April 2019,"... That's not because it was bad. It was bloody brilliant.I was so engrossed in this film I felt like I was there, being a character and fearing what was happening next.The film started off a little odd but soon settled into a reasonably realistic plot.Once the plot twist came about, that's when I wished I had the lights on. I'm by no means a wimp but this film had me mesmerised and despite stopping it about 15 mins from the end, I did watch the last bit with the lights on just to finish it off.A horror film such as this gives you a sense of the cliche horror movie but there is more to this movie than the trailers and brief synopsis and, for me anyway, having to stop watching near the end means this film has done its job of scaring the living s*** out of you and being a top horror movie.That said, it isn't without its pitfalls but you will not be disappointed.","As Above, So Below"
376,damiencaraway,"First review ever, but so worth it.",10,27 September 2018,"I'm not going to spoil the movie. But I will touch briefly on the other reviews. What movie were u all watching? This movie is awesome start to finish. I've been watching horror movies since before I really should have been. So I've seen all types of flicks, n rarely been startled at all. N for the record I hate most found footage or shaky camera films but not this one. This movie works on so many levels. N the first person view really helps to trap u in the characters world. I even found myself feeling a bit claustrophobic despite being in a well lit and open room. Kudos to the production team for that one. Did it terrify me no, did I jump...HELL YES. N I rarely jump during even the best movies. Would I recommend this movie...also HELL YES!! I look forward to finding it on Blu-ray so I can watch my friends reactions to the movie. I did enjoy the other movies from sams film team such as quarantine. But this movie dwarfs quarantine by far. Haven't enjoyed a horror movie this much since I was a kid. Great acting, great writing, subjects I'm interested in. Yeah there is some CGI but not much. And what little CGI there is really works well w the film. If I could give it more than ten stars I would. I finished the movie about 15 min ago n I'm still wicked pumped. Unless ur really claustrophobic I highly recommend this film. I'm a lil claustrophobic but not to point where it stops me. To those reviewers that gave this high marks.....ROCK THE HELL ON!","As Above, So Below"

388,darthwill-67978,Don't Believe the Critics,7,5 October 2020,"Now, don't go into this movie expecting the next Shining. That being said, the movie is still pretty damn good. I was pleasantly surprised after my first viewing, as I was expecting it to be another forgettable found footage movie. But this one stuck with me.First, while I'm not a huge fan of shaky-cam found footage, you can't fault this movie for it. Rather than creating sets, a majority of the movie was filmed in the actual Paris Catacombs. Since the tunnels are tight, I don't blame them for using small handheld cams. In fact, I admire this movie for using a real-life location as a filming locale, especially one as claustrophobic and frightening as the Catacombs. It adds a nice level of realism to the film.The plot is incredibly original. Compared to the now-tired horror movie plot tropes, such as slashers or demonic possession, this movie places the characters in the Catacombs of Paris in search of the legendary philosopher's stone. However, as they descend deeper, they enter the nine circles of Hell themselves, as referenced in The Inferno. Major props to the screenwriter(s) for turning a standard-looking horror flick into an homage to Dante. I suggest you either read The Inferno or read the plot synopsis before watching, if you haven't done so. The parallels are a lot of fun to find as the movie progresses.That being said, it does have some slight issues. Strange character decisions, some cheap jumpscares, somewhat subpar acting, and plenty of plot points that either don't make sense or create plot holes can be found throughout this movie. However, this does not affect one's overall enjoyment of the movie, if one is looking to have a good time watching an entertaining movie.I was shocked when I saw that this film was hated by critics. Sure, it isn't perfect, but it's oppressively frightening atmosphere and original plot makes this one of my favorites in the found footage genre.","As Above, So Below"

396,henry-732-353455,A Spoiler-Free Review,3,31 August 2014,"The entire family was excited to go see this. We packed in last night for a 9:40PM showing. Here's the rundown.Storyline - B+. The storyline plays on existing modern mythologies surrounding the Paris catacombs and a search for a forgotten historical object. Pretty simple and straightforward.Acting - B-. You're not going to get any stellar performances in this flick. We're missing a level of emotion needed for key scenes surrounding deaths. If the personal pain was presented it would have brought a whole different presence to the film. However, aside from this point, the action performances by the actors are solid an fun to watch.Location - A. Fantastic locations. I'm a bit of a catacomb buff anyway, so seeing these places was a pleasure. I have no idea if they used actual locations and really don't care. They successfully had me suspend my reality in favor of theirs. I did feel like I was in the catacombs below the streets of Paris. Well done.Cinematography - F. I know what you're thinking, ""C'mon, Henry, you absolutely love found footage movies. How the hell can you give this one an F for cinematography?"" Easy. Even the itty bitty sports-cams have a little thing called Steadycam - to ease the volume of shaking. I'm also aware of using shaky-cam as a method to disorientate the audience at specific times - I actually like that approach. With As Above, So Below it wasn't that way. With pen cams strapped to their heads, there was obviously no practice on limiting movement, how close you can get, etc.. So two thirds of the movie was jerking motions left and right so fast that many of the jumps and scares just didn't have the impact because nothing was really visible/in the shot/out of focus/blurry. Now, when you hear me say blurry don't think I mean only the camera was moving too fast - I mean at the beginning of the movie when the protagonist is being interviewed at a stationary location. The cameraman zooms in and out repeatedly (putting the star out of shot) and has the camera in then slightly out of focus repeatedly. This doesn't come across as stylistic, it comes across as being operated by an amateur. The entire movie runs this way making it actually painful to watch. We all left the movie feeling nauseous and with headaches. To add to this, we heard the majority of our fellow audience members saying the same thing.Final rating - D-. It's a fun concept, decent acting, dark spooky locations, and a solid script. But not watchable, which trumps pretty much all the other grades.So, the overall opinion of this? Read the synopsis and make up your own story. It'll hurt less.","As Above, So Below"
397,Sindra84,A must watch for horror lovers!,9,1 March 2015,"There is not a lot that gives me a good scare but this film actually made me scream!This film is based in Paris not that we see a lot of it above ground but that doesn't matter as what's below the ground is way more interesting.Through the whole of this film me and my friend kept trying to guess everything, (they're dreaming, they will die, he/she's going to kill them all, etc.) but we didn't get it till they wanted us to.It starts of with an actual explosion which wakes you up from the start. With the use of camcorders and head-cams the film has the found footage style which I love without giving away too much you just know that when you are at the front of the line something is bound to happen!With lots of jumpy scares all at the right time this film won't disappoint, if you liked The Tunnels, The Decent and The Da Vinci Code this it pretty much all 3 combined.Definitely one to watch!","As Above, So Below"
398,adeeb-trabulsi,A good story but not for a horror movie,7,18 December 2014,"The overall of the story is well written and it connects dots beautifully but for a supposedly horror movie I don't really see the horror in it. For example when they start to see their fears or their worst nightmares we only experience things from vague perspective, we don't really know the details or anything. And to be honest all the jump scares are really really predictable.The shaky camera is really annoying and sometimes they just throw it somewhere on the ground with an angled shot and leave the audience with a neck pain. We have seen a lot of shaky camera movies throw-out the years and I was hopping this would be different.As far as the story goes, the movies is amazing.","As Above, So Below"

It lacked cohesion, continuity and a 'Stedicam'. In fact the filming made me quite queasy, I've had better moments of gastric calm travelling on the'Vomit Comet' crossing the Irish Sea.I wish this technique of filming would run it's course. I know it's cheap and is supposed to add some edgeness to the movie, but overdone as it is in this film, leaves the viewer wanting to walk away from the screen, obviously the opposite effect any self respecting director would want.The acting is plausible though, even if it is a little hammed.","As Above, So Below"

This movie had the potential to be incredibly scary, and there were many good directions that they could have taken this, but they didn't choose the right path. It felt a little Blair Witch Project meets the Goonies to me. It gets little philosophical in the end for my taste (for a horror film, anyway.) 6/10.......for the good jump scares and the claustrophobia factor.......I wish that they would have just re-released The Descent instead.

401,arbitraryone,Chick never shuts up,2,8 November 2019,"This was tough to watch. The main chick is absolutely unbearable. She is constantly talking, and her character is so into herself in the always right know-it-all kind of way that I think if she were real someone would've strangled her to death or hit her with their car in the real world by now. There's a lot of issues with this movie that make it . The first 10-ish minutes could've been shortened or cut entirely. Main character already shows how little she cares about those who help her in this time, as well as through the rest of the movie so it's really hard to like her. Can you spend an hour and a half watching a self-centered know-it-all Chatty Cathy? I also sighed in disappointment when the ancient scripts they translate somehow rhymes perfectly in English and the math is somehow in the measurement of feet. They saved ""scary"" bits for the last 20 minutes of the flick which involves a couple creepy elements and a couple random jump scares. Till then its all following the British accent 20 year old valley girl and sometimes people argue.","As Above, So Below"
402,fayediviney,"""As above, so below, as within, so without, as the universe, so the soul""",8,4 May 2015,"I am very harsh on horror films, mainly because I barley watch any other genre other than the one. This movie however, was possibly one of the top movies of my list I've seen in years. The cinematography was spot on and it wasn't until I found out the film director had acquired special privileges to film in the actual catacombs of Paris that I finally understood the natural feel of the film, as well as the actors looking genuinely dirty and claustrophobic. Look out for some hidden 'easter eggs' in this movie that give away the ending even before you see it - and if you already know about the ending then you'll be re-watching the film wishing you had seen these things earlier. Free frame is everything! This movie for me was enjoyable and I loved recommending it to other people. For a 'found footage' film they really used what they had to make sure you felt uncomfortable. Paranormal Activity next to this movie? You'll see.","As Above, So Below"
403,go_best,Female Indiana Jones adventure in a Hell's hole!,7,2 October 2014,"I think ""Female Indiana Jones adventure in a Hell's hole!"" is pretty much described all, a little too fantasy for me it's weird how they connected different cultural belief to fit in the story(even though they don't have to! stick with ones is enough it's not the main point if you going to scare the audience with unexplained creepy character and object from dark memories etc. that none of that link to any belief?) and It's first person POV gave me a little hard time after watched the movie for 50 minutes( I guess this style is trending in horror films now right? and it give me dizzy every time, but not that all bad i enjoyed the whole though. The actors and actresses looks good, plenty of blood, darkness, claustrophobia. They made me much more want to visit Paris and also the catacomb for once in my life and the end credit with the soundtrack was nicely done.","As Above, So Below"
404,lace_and_pearls,"Ambitious Horror, Falls Flat",6,19 August 2021,"This is a 5 star horror film given 6 stars for its ambition and exploring some interesting ideas.My biggest critique is that the film is anticlimactic and by trying to dip its hand into too many myths or horror plots, does not accomplish much of anything. There are many unanswered questions and not in a ""this film really makes you think"" way, but a sloppy and indecisive writing way. The writers were so eager to jump to the next cool concept that everything fell flat from beginning to end.Halfway to three quarters through the film, some genuinely creepy things happen and it feels like the writers are building up to a horrific climax. Nope. An abrupt, difficult to believe, and unsatisfying end to a movie that had a lot of potential. What was the deal with the chanting group? The woman who attacked Benji? Why was hell so easy to escape for the final three?This is better than many found footage films and has a more adventurous storyline.","As Above, So Below"

Spend the whole movie watching through 1 hand-held camera, and 6-7 helmet cams. I guess the idea is that we learn the story from the cameras. But most of them are destroyed before the movie is over. So why did we have to watch through them? Seems like just a tool to keep things from having to make sense.And when there are 10 flashlights in the tunnel, why the heck doesn't one, single, person shine one of them into the darkness, or at the floor they are running along, instead of at the ceiling.

I don't wanna be cruel, but it has so many bloopers I'm not even going to jot them down. Besides, the acting is not credible and it doesn't even have a good script because at the end, I couldn't deduce where the film wanted to take me. However, if you want to see a non-scary film and fall sleep, I personally recommend you this film because it starts with a lot of information and a plot and ends with not even one conclusion. Don't get me wrong, I love enigmatic films and open ends, but I can foresee no one knew where this film was going till it was recorded. Sorry, I'm affronted.","As Above, So Below"

I have trying to watch As above so below. Poor acting, even poorer scripting, meandering aimless plot lines topped with bad camera work. I do not know whether to kill myself or everyone associated with the production and distribution of this heinous crime called cinema. I have seen better movies from toddlers with GoPro cameras strapped to their heads on youtube. If that is not enough let me add shallow characters. Or maybe moments of unexciting excitement. The many scenes of overacting betray the need for true emotional connection with the characters. No doubt the technical crew was grateful for the work. They at least did their jobs well. Mind you nobody cares who the grip was till they drop the boom.","As Above, So Below"
413,ashpinot,"A great buildup, a very disappointing ending.",3,29 August 2014,"Immediate reasons why I did not like this film: the trailers were misleading, we were given very little time with many of the main characters, and there was no good climax for the buildup the audience was given.I think most would agree with me when they say that they went into this movie thinking it was going to be a terrifying adventure deep into the catacombs encountering demonic spirits. That plays on two things: claustrophobia and the fear of evil, which has been done before, but is nevertheless a pretty good formula for generating fear. That's not what you get from this film: instead, you get a sort of mishmash between National Treasure and Don't Look Now with a dash of ""the power was inside you all along!"" This film is not about opening a portal to Hell, it is not about fighting off evil spirits.There are many characters whom we get little time with--Papillion and his friends--and things that seem important but are never explained. The strange dark-eyed girl who walks out of the nightclub, the creepy choir, the girl who stalked Benji, the hooded figure, the screaming statues...what is their purpose? We were never given an explanation for Benji's or the Mole's murders. In the end, Scarlet figures out that part of the reason they are trapped is because each of them has something tormenting them inside--her father's suicide, the little brother drowning, and the bastard child--and when they admit it, or accept it, they escape. We got a glimpse of Papillion's torment, but it was never explained, nor were Benji's or Papillion's girlfriend's. There are simply too many things left unexplained at the end of the movie. Speaking of the end--abrupt. That's what it was. The movie abruptly ended when I--and everyone else in the theater--assumed that we were just getting to the climax. ""Finally, now that they understand what to do, they can confront whatever is tormenting them."" Nope. The three remaining characters recite what their worst memory/fear is, climb out of a hole, and they're back in Paris, safe and sound. That's it. There is no devil, no demon, no cult, no evil stalking them. Some people may try to explain this away by saying that the theme of the movie is that the ""x"" was ""inside of you all along"", whether that ""x"" was power or fear or demons, but what it boils down to is poor characterization and storytelling.","As Above, So Below"
414,cocomababy,The Worst Horror Movie I've ever seen in Theater,1,7 September 2014,"I'm a die-hard horror movie fan. I would pretty much watch any horror movie that opens in theater whether it looks good or bad. I am always thirsty for horror movies. I watch horror movies on Netflix before I go to sleep in bed. However, horror movies are not the only type that I watch. I watch a lot of movies that I don't feel like watching because of my husband - from incomprehensible art movies to classical black & white movies and political documentaries, etc. Summing up, I watch a lot of movies including those that don't even interest me. Horror movies always get bonus points from me for just being horror movie. That being said, As Above So Below is the first movie ever in my whole entire life that I couldn't finish watching in theater. It wasn't just the shaky camera movement. It's not that it was boring. It was the arrogance of the movie makers that turned me off. I understand there is a lot of calculation involved when they make horror movies in order to draw very specific reactions from the audience in each scene. However, horror movies are in its essence childish and silly(in a good way). Therefore, good horror movies can be made only when that calculation is based on innocent passion and childish excitement, (OK commercial expectation too, which is fine) but not with illusion that they are being smart in their all too obvious attempt to manipulate the audience into believing pretentious dialogues and fake personalities as something intelligent and epic. It is an insult toward the audience.","As Above, So Below"

Think original Lara Croft mythology-based tombs combined with modern Lara Croft's character, on top of a pretty damn interesting set of riddles, incredible, but brief horror elements, that actually make sense. I actually had a few things figured out early on, but I don't think it's too predictable. I just watch far too many films now I sit on my thin ase most of the day.PS: I know my films. Please give this a go, although my Tomb Raider game playing from my youth may had led to a nostalgia-laced experience, so it may not seem as good to the uninitiated.How this got 38 on meta-critic and 6.1 on IMDb is discombobulating.","As Above, So Below"

I want to also mention that it gave me a very big headache and to the point where I almost threw-up.(SPOILERS) On to the actual review, the movie overall is confusing! I really did not get the part when the group enter the depths of hell. The movie did not do a good job explaining about the stone and why Scarlet had to bring it back. The movie was quite chopping and certain parts were unexplained and left for the viewers to ponder. My BIGGEST concern was why did they had to go in so many holes?? The last remaining survivors when in at least 2-3 holes to get out. The end was like....disappointing.The whole time when I was sitting in the movie theaters I could not get over the fact that it the whole entire movie was pitch dark and how the camera was shaky as crazy. My experience toward this movie is the producers could of did better. I do enjoy seeing the catacombs and artifacts.I would not recommend wasting your money seeing this movie even if you are a die hard horror fan.","As Above, So Below"
417,rhiedog,Complete and utter let down,3,29 August 2014,"I heard about this film after the trailer for it was retweeted onto my Twitter timeline by a friend. I watched the trailer quite a few times and I have to say I was extremely excited to watch it. I even did a review of the trailer for part of my Media coursework saying how amazing I thought the trailer was put together etc. However, after watching the first screening today.. I do NOT recommend spending money on a full price cinema ticket to watch this film. For starters, this ""found footage"" genre is being overused way too much. It's just lost that edge it used to give films of making it seem more realistic. Throughout the film, the same sets are used over and over again with little changes and story line is very thin. This film could have been set to be amazing, with a very individual, new plot and setting which people haven't seen before. However, the execution of the film and many of the actors very poor performance let the film down a lot. The ending of the film is predictable, just as many horror film endings are becoming and at many times throughout the film, pointless, sentimental things would happen which have no meaning to the plot and make the viewer lose touch with the film (e.g. a supposedly cute ""lets confess our love even though we may die in the next five minutes"" scene). The only positive thing I have to say about this film is in regards to François Civil. I have been a fan of his work for years and he is the only thing that holds this film together. He is a phenomenal actor and without him, this film would fall apart. With a weak story line, poor execution and very, VERY boring sound effects, lighting and CGI, I don't recommend this film to anyone. The trailer makes it out to be 100x better than it actually is.","As Above, So Below"

I very much thought there were a lot of very Creepy moments along with some legit scares. To me there are different types of Horror Flicks and different criteria for me to like a movie. This one has the ""Creepy"" factor. Also, it was a bit more intellectual and made me think. I want to see it again now to see if I catch parts I missed. It didn't seem so much like a ""found footage"" film as it felt more like a Documentary Style. And once the intensity started, it didn't let up. Overall, I really liked.","As Above, So Below"

A glimpse of something in back ground or panning the screen back and forth then something appears that wasn't there before is this generations version of scary, cut me a break. I pity this generation of movie goers. I haven't watched a good scary movie in years. They seem cheesy now, but go back to making movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Friday the 13th. I'm sick of all of these POV movies too. We know its a bunch of crap, so it doesn't make it any more real or scary. If anything it makes you sick to the stomach. From now on, if it's a horror movie, I'll wait for it to come out on Redbox.","As Above, So Below"
420,tjazzare-95-425260,"As a hand-held-horror enthusiast, I would say... PASS.",2,31 August 2014,"I just got done watching this movie at the theater.I actually REALLY enjoy the hand-held-horror flicks (""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Chernobyl Diaries"", ""The Descent"", etc.) so as one would expect, I was fairly excited to see this film. In fact, the hand-held-horror genre are the only films I am willing to pay to go see in theater (to get the full effect). But I have to say, ""As Above, So Below"" was quite the letdown.I never have high expectations for these films, for I feel their purpose lies in their cheap thrills and edgy ambiance (which needs to be experienced in a theater), but this movie just struggled to captivate me.First off, and maybe this has nothing to do with the movie, but I did feel quite nauseous within the first five minutes or so, and I have NEVER had a problem with this in the past. Maybe I am just getting older, or maybe it was the redundant zooming/shakier-than-usual cinematography? Second: the characters. Just about every other film mentioned above had at least 1 or 2 sensible/believable characters... I was chuckling quite frequently at how ridiculously insensible the characters in this film are. Unreal. Where's the emotion? They seemed more fascinated than terrified. I'm not buying it.Last, while the plot was somewhat original (2 stars for originality), the characters' indifferent attitudes combined with the mediocre plot points just made it boring. And while I am all for cheap thrills and pop-out scares, the real thrill of a horror flick is generated via its despair-ambiance; the psychological trauma induced by the eeriness and overwhelming sense of hopelessness and the characters' vulnerabilities... absent in this film. (The 2009 movie ""Triangle"" offers a good example of this).In conclusion, if the idea of venturing deep underground to explore the mysteries of an abyss intrigues you, I recommend watching ""The Descent"" instead. I feel it is a much more satiable film exploring a very similar idea.","As Above, So Below"
421,Thegrip-99-568207,On a par with Blair Witch,8,5 September 2014,"I was almost put off watching this film due to some of the bad reviews I'd read elsewhere, so I went with an open mind but didn't regret it.Not since Blair Witch have I been more engrossed in a film which, in parts, was genuinely scary and claustrophobic...it really sucks you in to the point you feel that you are down there with them...Once the initial ""introduction to the characters"" bit was over and they entered the first part of the catacomb, the film properly began...from the minute they passed a group of strange naked women carrying out what I assume what satanic chants deep below the ground, I was hooked...and the phone ringing really freaked me out....!! The section when they were in ""hell"" was intense with noises that you would indeed associate with such a place, if it were to exist..deep screams and cries, absolutely terrifying...the hooded demons were the stuff of real nightmares and you just wondered what the hell (pardon the pun) was going on down there as without the groups head torches they would be down there in the pitch black...doing what I wondered..? Very eerie to say the least...it was definitely a good interpretation of hell...This film is not for the purists amongst us, and there is indeed room for criticism...the shaky camera is not everyone's cup of tea and at times, you are relieved when they are static for a brief moment and the motion stops, however this did not distract me from what was a thoroughly enjoyable film...there is also an element of scooby do about the whole thing as the group keep repeating ""we must carry on"" every time something bad happened and the constant running away from bad things...As for the ending...I didn't get it as such, but i liked it....it does make you think...you leave the cinema pondering on what just happened and HOW it could happen...it maybe wasn't the crap ending that some reviewers have stated...I liked it...Quite simply, If you liked Blair Witch, you will like this...if you're looking for high budget, great acting and CGI, you won't...I'd give it 8/10 purely because the shaky camera was at times too much and you just wanted a bit of camera stabilisation..!!I'd recommend this film, definitely..","As Above, So Below"

423,manuelteofilo,its good and scary!,8,12 September 2014,"I guess that this film should be seen on cinemas! This is my first critic considering that the creatures are poorly defined due to the overly emphasis in the dark atmosphere. a little bit of post production secondary lights wouldn't hurt no one. although there were 'many non-believers' in the cinema room i saw a lot of those jumping from their chairs in one or two sequences! very effective!My second critic is the main character, in agreement with former descriptions added to this review, its contrived and i don't why its qualities reminded me of Lara Croft on the spot. even the unresolved issue with a dead father.My third one its a mix of good and bad! the duality of heaven and hell never have been so well introduced and integrated in a story like this one. i loved it! the graphical nuances and connections with existing history myths was very well mounted. its clear that the middle of the movie marks the deepest real depth and after that all the unreal depth is in their minds but you don't feel it in the graphics! you can only tell when the try to open the sewer lid. OK, maybe its what the director wanted but... i think a little reference graphic to show that they were upside down would be nicer.with all that said.... i hope that there's a 2nd movie like a picked up storyline from the first, like the conjuring and yet to premiere Annabelle, and thus the crew could learn from early mistakes and make a reference in adventure/horror style.

424,fmgunsmithing,SPOILER ALERT ! An in dept look at what makes this movie unique. DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.,8,15 September 2014,"Nothing is perfect But I think these film is Purdy darn good I'll tell you what! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED. My review refers to the film throughout. You have been warned!What makes a horror movie enjoyable? A question we cannot answer easily... For me, it has to feel real... and it has to make you THINK using plausible methodology. this movie pulls it off.We start off in the catacombs under Paris, a place synonymous with death and suffering of millions. Knowing this place truly exists and the film is made in part on location in Paris is the first plus. Enter the catacombs, following the story the idea of religious chambers therein make perfect sense. The explorers come across a few scary ""undertakers"" or ""demon"" spirits while on journey to find what they are looking for, these encounters are scary but withheld to a degree, something that adds to the fear and reality factor. Arrival: The team Finds something,...then find themselves in a bad situation,... only way to go is down. At this point, the intelligence and audacity of the actors is what is keeping them alive, good choices and looking around and reading / referring to codes. Interesting enough, the gates of Hell are guarded by divine entrance... and my favorite part, the INVERSE, if you use your head and think a little,...rewind the process they underwent to get to this point... look around... feel the change and the added darkness. you will understand the uniqueness of the inverse. As they explore further the Revelations are more intense...much more intense,...but withheld which makes perfect sense. If you think hard, and paid attention in your elective religious college course(s) or the bible in general / along with Plausible N.D.E. accounts,.. hell is not necessarily a bottomless pit full of fire and brimstone..It is What you envision it to be, what your individual worse nightmare is...coupled with the burden of your sins and the weight on your conscious. The Ending is surprising... that I wont Spoil for you. To summarize,... Have you ever wondered what a real Hell is? The process by which you would enter it? This is of course, FICTION... but if Hell is real, what better place to put the entry way than below Paris??? Will you fall into a Fire? Or slowly crawl through the dark passages to make your way there? Camera work is great, the found footage isn't too pronounced. I think this is a fantastic film for people interested in horror with a withheld religious realistic feel. IF YOU DON'T USE YOUR HEAD YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM. EVERYTHING HAS A MEANING IN THIS FILM.","As Above, So Below"

During the fast action scene I felt motion sick from watching as the camera attempted to sweep thru the tunnels quickly. the film has Continuous obnoxious audio.

431,wize-202-201715,Nonsense,1,2 January 2015,"the whole squad dies, for nothing. she ""wants to find out the truth"" the truth of a conceptless stupid, fake tomb raiding,lara croft fake ass oyinbo with a large stomach pack, galavanting around the tombs with her bae, only for the very none relevant character to walk away at the end, like they didn't just come out of a near death experience with a couple dons from hell. This film was long winding for no reason. Had a silly stone in which magically healed wounds meanwhile everyone had cabin fever and managed not to some how freak out when this event occurred. Plus the main bitch seemed to have no conscious leading the whole squad right into their deaths.","As Above, So Below"
432,jaypr2000,Great!,9,17 January 2015,"Only can describe this movie with one word, AMAZING! I had a great time watching this movie, defiantly unique, that's what made the movie so interesting and fun to watch. The beginning I could admit was kind of slow but as the story progressed I absolutely cannot complain. I had a fun time putting the pieces of the puzzle together at the end. If you like suspenseful, scary type movies to watch by yourself or with friends, this is a great pick! From the acting to the actual story itself was a great thing to experience, I haven't felt this way about a horror movie in A LONG time. 9/10","As Above, So Below"

434,purplemonstereg,Trippy,10,25 May 2020,I have seen this movie for than 4 times in one week. This movie connects from beginning to end which I love. The beginning is kinda slow and the camera is a bit shaky but it simmers down the closer they get to the catacombs. This movie is not a scary movie! Don't get me wrong it can be considered scary in a few parts but its mostly suspenseful. pls watch it,"As Above, So Below"
435,b_mary,Scary Mystery Horror with a Lara Croft wannabe and a deeper meaning that fails to convey,6,25 May 2015,"This movie seems to have a lot of mixed reviews, so let me start by saying that to me this was definitely a scary movie. Granted, it wasn't nail-biting exciting or I-didn't-sleep-for-two-days scary but it did capture my full attention for the whole length of the movie. This is also a real classic mystery horror, so there is not a lot of blood gushing down. I picked this out to watch with my sister who cannot stand the sight of blood and she made it through the movie perfectly fine, that says enough I guess.I would definitely recommend this movie in terms of acting and camera work. The hand-held camera perspective makes every horror movie a lot better to me and in this one it's done very well. The acting is on point but this doesn't make you get any sympathy for the characters. The setting in the catacombs of Paris was probably the best thing about this movie and is what gives it most of it's scary vibes.But there were so many things wrong with this movie that I still don't know if I hate it or love it. First of all, from a historical point of view (and yes, I am a historian) this whole movie was based on a legend and a whole string of ancient myths and old believes that have been mixed and matched and topped off with some talk about Copernicus to make it all seem legit. The main story is not at all historically accurate except for the existence of the catacombs. I know most people don't care about this but stories like this never fail to frustrate me.Second, the lead character Scarlett worked on my nerves from the first second she started to talk and I don't believe I'm the only one. Like other people have said 3 degrees of which 2 PhD's, professor at a British university, really? I honestly think the makers of this movie don't know what that means. This girl looks as old as me and I'm working my but off just to get my Master's degree. And for the record, you don't speak DEAD languages, nobody is fluent in Latin or ancient Greek. I know she is pretty and young because a real professor isn't appealing (which I would deny but I probably don't belong to the mainstream audience) and that she is adventurous and intelligent to make her character the drive behind the whole movie, but to be honest she was just really annoying.And then there is the deeper psychological meaning that defines the whole plot of the movie but kind of fails. From the beginning of entering the catacombs it because more and more apparent that the things the characters see are more in relation to there own past that haunts them. But for some characters this is done a lot better than others. It seems as if the makers couldn't decide between fully going for this psychological aspect or still using creepy creatures as ways to kill off the members of the group. It would have been interesting if the aspect of the haunting past would have been more defined and better integrated in the story. Some things never get explained which bothered me a bit. If you're gonna invest a lot of time to explain the most of it, then please explain all of it and don't leave me hanging.The ending was kind of ""meh"". It was original in it's genre but still pretty predictable if you paid attention. And I honestly don't like the ""okay we're done here, bye""-kind of endings.So in conclusion, it's a good movie because it really is pretty scary from time to time and some scenes were wonderfully shot. But don't give too much thought to the story itself or the meaning of it all.www.thebloodymaryreviews.wordpress.com","As Above, So Below"
436,ianjhall,"Spoiler Alert! As above, so below",2,15 June 2015,"I'm sorry but there is so many points that ruin this movie for me. One, for a group of experienced climbers, cave divers, archaeologists they make poor Benji (inexperienced camera man) really suffer. Making him go last through tight gaps and deep drops. Two, with all their experience they lose their heads easily in sticky situations. Three, A guy has been down there for two years and is still clean shaven, really? Four, the main character is reckless, way too eager, fearless and seemingly unfazed about all the deaths happening around her. Five, everyone is young, Fit and attractive which always ruins the believability of a film for my or maybe I'm just jealous haha. I'll pick at films like this because as a found footage film you'd want as much realism as possible but I just couldn't believe it. The only good point is that it was filmed on location which made it more interesting.","As Above, So Below"
437,phenixsamuel,Better than I expected,8,15 November 2019,I thought I was going to see a cheap and a bit predictive horror movie but I was genuinely surprise by how good it was. For once I care about the characters and the ending surprised me. Not a masterpiece but a must see on your list.,"As Above, So Below"
438,tahiyatchy,Not For Those Averse To A Little Thinking,9,1 November 2021,"As Above, So Below is a rather ingenious contribution to the found footage genre; from beginning to end, it consistently presents well-executed symbolism and allegory. It demands a certain level of comprehension of its audience, without which they will be left unsatisfied, as if half the movie itself had passed beyond their range of sight. Overall brilliant progression.","As Above, So Below"
439,steelerjenn,Cannot believe this movie received a low score,10,18 November 2018,"I saw this movie a few years ago. I recorded it to watch later. Then, I watched it. I've watched this movie at least 10+ times. It's chilling. As of late, I have been looking at the reviews of a movie I'm about to watch, which is dumb. I finally looked at the reviews for this movie, and was dumbfounded. This movie is great, and although it doesn't happen so often, or maybe it does, the critics are wrong about this movie. Also, I'm a huge horror fan, but besides that the movie is labled ""horror"" I think it's a great movie, period!","As Above, So Below"
440,pyrrhospal,Good movie that could've been great,6,17 March 2016,"A very promising setting for a horror film, and one that has been used surprisingly little (The Catacombs, 2007 is the only other example I can find, which in a fun bit of trivia, stars the singer, Pink/Alecia Moore). The premise is also promising, mixing Dante with Dan Brown. (I am not a modernist myself, which is a fancy way of saying that I don't look down on projects that are not wholly or sufficiently original, especially since the notion that ""genius=highest level of originality"" didn't really develop until the mid-1800s). Lots of fun allusions for the literati and history geeks, and a decent mechanism for explaining them for those who aren't familiar with Dante's Inferno and the various historical legends/myths. However, my bet is that the writers--who to this point had not had much success, aside from Quarantine (2008), which barely turned a profit--were more eager to get the project in theaters, than to get it right. Therefore, a number of ideas are not fully developed or well explained, the resolution and ending feel conveniently tacked on, rather than a natural outgrowth of the storyline (could they have avoided attacks by the stone priests if they had simply reconciled themselves internally?, etc.). The same type of issues plague other characters and story lines. For example, the purpose and motivation of the wild-eyed girl who directs the ""Catacombs Glee Club Choir"" is not well defined (possibly jilted by Benji?). Also, the ""mystery monk"" and the ""attacking stone priests"" have no apparent motivation or purpose, other than to introduce new physical danger/creepiness of ancient religion. Souxie's transformation from ""abandoned mole person"" to wild animal is completely unexplained, while Pappilon's death by being sucked into the ground up to his knees (an allusion to the Dante) does not match the momentary and non-threatening nature of George's dead brother. So on and so on: it just feels like the writing, editing, and production process were rushed, resulting in a movie that was good, when it could've been great.","As Above, So Below"
441,dadawg48506,very predictable and not scary!!!!!,2,16 March 2019,"Don't waste your time with this movie. if you like a little reality in your horror movies, this movie is not for you. the filming of this movie using the ""blair witch technique"" is okay, but seems to be done only this way to keep production costs low. right from the movies start, everything comes together way too perfectly, and this puzzle of the adventure falls into place the same way. the special effects in this movie are quite cheesy, and too many things happen during the journey that really don't make much sense. i never found myself scared during the movie, but just annoyed that what i was seeing was supposed to frighten me. the acting in general is not terrible, but definitely over the top in many points of the movie. you've been warned!!!","As Above, So Below"
442,gearjamminbilly,Too much dumb girl gum flapping,1,18 May 2019,"If I could have given a half star, I would have. The main female character spends too much time flapping her gums about crap that isn't in need of being said. Less talk, more action.","As Above, So Below"
443,billfern-58164,Good scary movie,10,9 March 2019,"Was looking for a good movie to watch and found it! The setting for the movie was great in the catacombs, the acting was good to the point it was believable for most of the movie. And there were a few parts that scared the hell out of us. That's what makes it great , I highly recommend checking it out.","As Above, So Below"

This movie made me wish I was there with them so I can die...","As Above, So Below"

446,statherjoe,Awful do not watch!,1,30 June 2017,"This film is sh!t. worst plot ever. i don't get whats happening half the film, poorly explained. The whole ending makes literally no sense, whilst this is a logical impossibility there fore whoever made this film, was clearly not thinking straight. i recommend that anybody that is looking to watch this, just simply doesn't. don't waste your time.","As Above, So Below"
447,msheatherms,watch The Descent instead,1,11 September 2014,"I hated watching this movie. The writers of AASB basically watched The Descent and stole almost everything from it. They then tried to cover it up by throwing in some mythology. The few scenes they did create to make it different weren't even always necessary. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they stole them from somewhere else. If you have watched The Descent, think of a cave scene, it's probably in there. I know that underground movies are going to have similarities but this one blatantly stole so many parts. I spent the entire movie thinking, ""I bet this will be in here"" and ""oh yeah, I forgot about that one"". If you want to watch an actual good scary/suspense than see The Descent. Maybe watch this one afterward if you want to see a direct comparison.","As Above, So Below"
448,tlhith,Great adventure and scared the shit out of you,10,10 February 2018,"Not only IMDB but also other movies platform has bias about horror movies, especially this found-footage genre movie. However, this one is special in its kind. This movie makes you are really experiencing what the actors are going through. And it tells a story about redemption. A great horror movie you should not miss.","As Above, So Below"
449,pk-22341,Modern Dante's Inferno,8,3 July 2020,"Not historically a fan of found footage horror (film was my girlfriend's choice to watch), I found the film intriguing and claustrophobic and genuinely creepy and once I realised the references to hell in the catacombs, it became apparent the group were travelling through the nine circles of hell from Dante's Inferno, with a sub-plot involving the philosopher's stone.I think a lot of people writing the reviews on here have missed this important connection and are unfairly labelling the film as clichéd. Whilst some of the scare techinques may well be clichéd, this homage to Dante makes for impelling viewing.The truly creepy and claustrophobic middle section of the film does start to lose its focus towards the end and veers into the unbelievable, though only through uninitiated eyes.","As Above, So Below"

451,jmusf,Don't understand what the bad reviews are about,8,18 November 2018,"I went in with zero expectations, but the film was better than expected. The beginning I felt was a little slow, but I understand it was needed for a little background info. Once inside the catacombs I felt like the film picked up quickly. The film contains some jump scares, but what I like is that it doesn't depend on them. Most of the movie builds up tension and anxiety of you anticipating what will happen next. I also don't understand why people are complaining about the camera work? This is a first person movie and I'm pretty sure if you were running through the catacombs, you wouldn't be holding the camera steady either. Plus no one said these people went to film school they are amateur camera men filming their experience in the catacombs, and I thought the shaky camera work added to the authenticity of the film. As for the ending, I thought it was original. I feel like there's so many movies like this that have the same ending over and over and this film strayed away from that. Overall I felt like this was a pretty good film and is worth a watch if you enjoy horror movies.","As Above, So Below"
