0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very entertaining action film, while not being as good as the first film",8,13 June 2010,"I do agree with anybody who says that Die Hard with a Vengeance is not as good as the original Die Hard. Then again it did have a lot to live up to, seeing as Die Hard is a real benchmark in the action genre. This film in a very good franchise is still very, very good, and does try very hard to keep to the spirit of the original film.While perhaps running a little too long, and the beginning is rather slow, the film does move briskly and has slick direction, as well as more than its fair share of tense, funny and witty lines in the script. The plot, made up of two stories really, is cleverly balanced and actually doesn't fall into the trap of becoming convoluted or derivative, and the score was very well done, with musical and comedic touches. Die Hard With a Vengeance is also very stylishly filmed with fluid cinematography, great effects and dazzling scenery coupled with authentic sound effects, and there are plenty of explosive set pieces. And the acting was great, Bruce Willis is terrific as John McClane, while Samuel L. Jackson always the solid actor matches him perfectly, and their chemistry is what makes the movie enjoyable. Jeremy Irons is also excellent as Simon Gruber, perhaps not as good as Alan Rickman in the original who was the epitome of evil, but he is still good, playful and threatening.Overall, very enjoyable entry in a very good franchise. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Die Hard with a Vengeance
1,Leofwine_draca,Action comedy masterpiece,10,26 March 2016,"It's very rare for the first three films in a movie franchise to be consistently excellent, but that's the case with the DIE HARD series. The first one was an action movie masterpiece and hugely influential to this day. The second one is disliked by some, but I think it's very nearly the equal of the first, doing a tricky job of being the same but different at the same time. And the third is just a delight, an action comedy masterpiece that wreaks havoc throughout New York.Having the action move out of a single location and into an entire city was a genius idea. Director John McTiernan is at the top of his game here, filling his movie with an incredible sense of drive and momentum so that there's not a single moment where it's not funny, thrilling, or suspenseful. Bruce Willis has never been better and his repartee with Samuel L. Jackson (who also gives one of the best turns of his career) works incredibly well. Jeremy Irons has a ball as the bad guy and the whole 'Simon Says' game is very well staged. Plus you get all of the violence, fights, car chases, shoot-outs and clever situations that you could hope for in an action film. DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE truly is one of the best action films ever made and the kind of film I could sit and watch over and over again, and there are very few of those around.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
2,SnoopyStyle,Feels like a different franchise,6,17 November 2013,"John McClane (Bruce Willis) has fallen on hard times. A bomber (Jeremy Irons) demands that McClane play a game and the NYPD recalls him back to work. In one game, he's helped by a good Samaritan Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson). The two go off on a high intensity scavenger hunt.The fact that he's called in by name means that this one veers off from the formula from the start. The first two had him alone in the wrong place at the wrong time surprising the bad guys. This one he's paired up, demanded by the bad guy to play a game running across NY. It feels like a different franchise. Where's the family? They've thrown out the formula.Director John McTiernan returns to do a big action extravaganza. He follows the rule of sequels by making a bigger movie. Jeremy Irons is a great bad guy, but I would prefer Bruce Willis to be a lone wolf. Nevertheless Sam Jackson is always a great choice. If this wasn't a Die Hard movie, it would be just another brainless action thriller.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
3,classicsoncall,"""You are about to have a very bad day.""",8,8 March 2015,"Relentless and over the top action that takes the term 'implausible' to the limit, this third film in the Die Hard franchise is just the ticket if you're up for some mindless movie mania. I thought it was kind of cool the way the film makers had Alan Rickman drop in from the original ""Die Hard"" flick, and having Bruce Willis trade barbs with Samuel L. Jackson as things got rolling made for an entertaining 'almost buddy' team-up. I particularly found it interesting the way McClane (Willis) reversed the racist angle on Zeus Carver (Jackson) during the three gallon/five gallon scene. It was done without being racist itself, and not everyone could get away with it the way McClane did. It was near the end of the movie when I was about to give up on McClane's t-shirt changing color the way it did in the first film, but almost as soon as the thought crossed my mind, it was approaching a dark green with only the very top of the tee a dull white color on both of McClane's shoulders. The only thing that takes the edge off these action films made prior to 9/11 is the sobering image of the Twin Towers, this time clearly visible in an early scene when McClane is on the subway train. Watching today almost twenty years after the film was originally made, there's added significance to the film's plot in which the German gangsters were working freelance for the Iranians.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
4,jboothmillard,Die Hard with a Vengeance,8,16 June 2005,"Director of the first film John McTiernan (Predator) returns with this third film installment with the humorous, wise-cracking and admirable hero in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is a quiet morning in New York city, till an explosion suddenly takes place at a department, and then the police receive a phone call from the terrorist, calling himself Simon (Jeremy Irons). Simon says (that's the game he's playing) he wants Lt. John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is on suspension and an alcoholic, to go the corner of 138th Street and Amsterdam in Harlem wearing a racist sign. This is how he meets the almost completely white hating store owner and accomplice Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson, not long after Pulp Fiction), and they stick together as they travel round New York following Simon's instructions and figuring out his riddles, to stop more bombs going off. Simon tells them he has placed a bomb in a school (a lie), so while the cops are busy searching for it, and eventually ""defusing"" it, Simon Gruber (yes, Hans from the first film's brother) is getting closer to his goal of revenge, stealing millions and destroying New York, with John and Zeus hot on his and the terrorists tail. Also starring Graham Greene as Joe Lambert, Colleen Camp as Connie Kowalski, Kevin Chamberlin as Charles Weiss and Sharon Washington as Officer Jane. Like the first sequel it may not be as fun to watch and completely original as the first film, but this is certainly better than Die Hard 2, Willis and Jackson make a good double-act, there are some good chases and explosions, and the great catchphrase ""Yippee-ki-yay mother f***er"", a very good action thriller. Bruce Willis was number 35, and Samuel L. Jackson number 11 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
5,ccthemovieman-1,Very Entertaining But Too Low-Class,5,30 May 2006,"I found lots of entertainment value in this but way overdone with the violence, profanity and the totally-implausible scenes. It's just so darn interesting with so many good stunts that it's hard to totally ignore this film despite the stupidity. It's almost like a very good Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme or Sylvester Stallone no-brainer-but-fun action flick, except it's Bruce Willis.Willis and co-star Samuel Jackson are incapable of uttering a sentence without profanity. But, sometimes they are funny and they certainly aren't boring. The violence will wear you out by the time 2 hours and change are over. Recommended only for those who like their entertainment non-stop and aren't offended by anything hitting their eardrums.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
6,rmax304823,"Bang, bang -- then BOOM.",6,6 April 2007,"As with any effective action movie, you're glued to the screen even as you goggle at the stupidity of it all. People get shot, sawed in half by wire ropes, blown up, run over by renegade subway trains, electrocuted by helicopters whose rotor blades make a mare's nest of high-tension power cables. I couldn't count the number of exploding fireballs. There are, I think, three maniacal car chases. (It depends on how you define car chase. Is a lone cab bounding at full speed through the woods of Central Park a ""car chase""?) It's like watching a Roadrunner cartoon. Bruce Willis is spat out of an aqueduct tunnel by the force of the water, loops through the air, and plops down into a mud puddle unhurt. ""Whew,"" he's likely to say, ""what a #@#%!%#@^%!ing close call THAT was!"" Samuel Jackson as his unwilling partner matches him step for step, in a plot partly structured along the lines of the old mismatched cop movies that ran out of steam a decade or so ago.Both Willis and Jackson are quite good for reasons most people already will recognize. There's nothing like a blood-covered Willis wisecracking and wincing with real pain as he extracts a piece of shrapnel from his flesh with his own teeth -- unless it's Jackson with his bulging eyes and crackling high voice responding angrily to some racist remark. ""Say WHUT?"" I see I've kind of skipped much of the plot but it wanders off in several tenuously related directions anyway? Jeremy Irons with a faux German accent is the heavy and he belongs in a different movie. Nobody else registers.You know what it's like? It's like a comic pornographic film. ""Debby Does New York."" Exciting episode follows exciting episode and they are linked by only the slenderest of narrative threads.Let's see. That makes it a combination skin flick, mismatched cop movie, and Roadrunner cartoon. Hmmmm. Yeah, I guess that about covers it. It's tense, amusing, and filled with stunts. And if you're in the proper mood it's captivating.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
7,ma-cortes,High-voltage action thriller with a fine chemical between Bruce Wills and Samuel L. Jackson,7,22 January 2020,"This third part that brings again another impossible situation results to be a nice buddy movie with stoppable action, thrills, explosions, pursuits and humor. A powerful action thriller with the tough-cookie, wise-cracking cop John McClaine : Bruce Willis, who joins forces with Samuel L Jackson, as a reluctant shopkeeper , to take down villainous people who are planting a series of massive bombs across NYC and especially at the threatened schools plenty of little students . Here McClaine facing off foreign ruthless, high-stakes recruits and their heinous boss, Jeremy Irons, as the brother of of the bad boy, Alan Rickman, who Willis killed in the first film. Along the way MacClane dangerously fleeing from bursting dam waters rushing at him down underground tunnel.Here McClaine, Bruce Willis, is back home in the Big Apple, having another bad day and suffering chaos and destruction, including a breathtaking subway crash and a spectacular flood. Obviously repeats partially the plot of previous entries with references to the former in the screenplay, including his estranged and separated wife, Bonnie Bedelia . While the first outing Die Hard 1988 by John MacTiernan was set at a claustrophobic Los Angeles skycraper and the second Die Hard 2 : Die harder 1990 by Renny Harlin was set at an airport, this third part is set at New York streets. This installment features energetic action and finely acted interpretations from the three leads : Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Jeremy Irons. Being well accompanied by a nice support cast as Graham Greene, Colleen Camp, Sam Philips, Nick Wyman, and Tony Peck.It packs a colorful cinematography by Peter Menzies, adding an exessive hand-held camerawork and annoying steadicam. As well as rousing and moving musical score by Michael Kamen. This fast, well-done follow-up motion picture was professionally directed by John McTiernan, though is inferior than the first part which he made too. John is a good craftsman who has got a lot of hits, such as : Die Hard, Predator, The hunt for Red October, The 13th warrior, The Thomas Crown affair, Last action hero, ,but also some flops as Nomads, Medicine man, Basic, and Rollerball especially. Rating : 6.5/10. Notable action film. Better than average.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
8,BA_Harrison,Die Hard with a Lethal Weapon.,8,18 August 2013,"Die Hard director John McTiernan returns for this second sequel to his 1988 action classic, which sees Bruce Willis once again playing tough NY cop John McClane, this time being sent on a wild-goose chase around the Big Apple in the company of Harlem 'good Samaritan' Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) while evil Euro-villain Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) breaks into the city's Federal Gold Reserve.Full of the incredible explosive set-pieces that one has come to expect of the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance certainly delivers in terms of sheer spectacle, but with Jackson's Carver in tow, one-time 'lone cowboy' McClane has now become one half of a comedy act, the film working more like an 80s buddy movie as a result. As the film reaches its climax, McClane also begins to exhibit signs of the superhero style powers of invincibility that made Live Free or Die Hard such a let-down. It's not enough to make me dislike the film—I still had a lot of fun with this one—but it is a worrying sign of things to come7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
9,paul_haakonsen,"An innovative third movie in the ""Die Hard"" franchise...",7,10 December 2020,"Well, if you enjoyed the 1988 ""Die Hard"" and the 1990 ""Die Hard 2"" movies, then you most certainly will also enjoy the 1995 third movie in the franchise ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"".The storyline as delivered by writer Jonathan Hensleigh proved to be innovative for the franchise, while it kept the very essence and spirit of the franchise at heart. So ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" was a welcomed addiction to the action franchise.Once again does Bruce Willis return to reprise the role as John McClane, the police officer with an attitude and a knack for getting himself into precarious situations. And this third movie also has Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson on the cast list, both of whom definitely added something unique to the movie and to the franchise as a whole. Jeremy Irons proved to be right up there alongside with Alan Rickman in terms of portraying an interesting villain in this particular franchise.""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" has an abundance of action, just as the previous two movies did, so you are definitely in for a treat. But at the same time, then ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" proves to have more to its storyline than just action and that stereotypical one-man-against-an-army-of-bad-guys feel to it.I will say that the storyline told in ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" was an enjoyable one, and there were some nice twists to the plot along the way, which made for a non-linear and somewhat unpredictable storyline. Not only is it an entertaining story, but director John McTiernan also manages to get the audience dragged in and feeling like they are right there alongside McClane and Zeus.If you haven't already seen the 1995 movie ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" from director John McTiernan, it is about time you do so, as this is an entertaining and enjoyable action movie. My rating of ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" settles on a well-deserved 7 out of 10 stars.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
10,blanche-2,frightening for all the wrong reasons,7,9 February 2003,"Unfortunately I just saw this film.  I don't want to put in a spoiler so I'll just say - recent events make watching this movie terrifying and spooky, mostly because of the film's use of location.  One scene in particular today takes on new meaning.  It's interesting how the minute you put something on film, you date it so that even a few years later, it has ramifications beyond its original intent.  Watch this if you dare and you'll see what I mean.  As an entry into the ""Die Hard"" series, it's very good - Bruce Willis is always attractive and can keep a film going, and Jeremy Irons is an excellent villain.  But the real villain here is history.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

But this is a terrific action film that not only has great suspense making you think till the end, but good teamwork by Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson that actually make some comic relief.  In this enstallment, Bruce once again plays Lieutenant John McClane, back in New York and on pention.  But now, he has a new terrorist on his hands, the brother (jeremy Irons) of the original terrorist (Alan Rickman).  But it isn't just about revenge, in this thriller.

Since Honest Abe was our 16th, just go down the line of Johnson, Grant, Hayes,Garfield and Arthur, as in Chester A.

Just like in the case of the brother,it's all about money-the gold at the Federal Reserve Bank of N.Y. We have bombings of a department store and subway for Irons to show that he means business.Bruce Willis was born to play John McClane, the fast talking, foul-mouthed policeman who is on suspension but is called back to service thanks to Irons's sinister ways. McClane is evenly matched with racist store owner,Samuel L. Jackson, who is brought into the plot and by film's end, he realizes that all whites aren't necessarily bad.The action is non-stop and very fast paced.

14,hitchcockthelegend,McTiernan is back and it's kaboom time in the Big Apple.,8,7 August 2012,"Die Hard: With a Vengeance is directed by John McTiernan and written by Jonathan Hensleigh. It stars Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Irons, Graham Greene, Nick Wyman, Larry Bryggman and Colleen Camp. Music is scored by Michael Kamen and cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr.Detective John McClane (Willis) is on suspension and drinking a lot, but when a bomb goes off on the streets of New York, a man named Simon (Irons) calls the police demanding that McClane joins in a game of Simon Says otherwise more bombs will go off.Although Renny Harlin was unlucky to have the unenviable task of trying to helm a sequel to arguably the greatest action film in the modern era, there is no denying that Die Hard 2 was a considerable drop in quality. We can also say with honesty that to try and come up with a villain half as brilliant as Alan Rickman's Uber Gruber was a thankless task, but that's the primary problem with Die Hard 2, William Sadler's villain is just not interesting, charming or witty enough. So for part three the makers made three crucial decisions, they brought back John McTiernan, they brought in Jeremy irons for villain duties and they gave McClane a side-kick of considerable worth. Back comes high end action, back comes searing violence and back comes the humour. Die Hard 3 nabs the great ingredients from the first film but still plays out as its own animal, the decision to take McClane out of a confined space set-up and let him loose out in the expansive areas of NYC works really well, as does having him partnered by Samuel L. Jackson's (on fine form) Zeus, a smart mouthed, angry, wise, borderline racist shop owner who winds up as the perfect foil for McClane's machismo and witticisms. If this sounds like a Lethal Weapon type set-up then that's probably because the bulk of the script was actually considered to be one of the Lethal Weapon sequels. But to have it play out as a Die Hard formula brings rich rewards as the plotting has much suspense by way of Simon's death trap riddles and the race against time plot turn that dominates a good portion of the movie. While the dialogue sparkles, allowing the lead actors room to really impress themselves on the story.It's also great to find that McTiernan and co don't take the easy option of just filling the movie out with high octane action and stunts. There's plenty of that stuff about, with punch-ups, car chases, explosions and outrageous high wire heroics; McTiernan is after all a master director of action scenes, but there's a good twisty plot at the core as well. With grey area motives, deception and mystery elements pulsing away in the narrative. Add in McClane's woes; hangovers and marital strife, Zeus' severe mistrust of the white man, and you find a lot of story that the impressive action is wrapped around. Irons is ace, not in Rickman's villain league (who is), but he gives Simon charm in abundance, a dastard sense of humour and Irons has buffed up for vest wearing duties and gone Aryan blonde into the bargain as well. Yep, this is a cool villain and the film benefits greatly from Irons' turn.Faults? The roll call of baddies assembled around Simon are standard stereotypes being performed by one note actors. The absence of Bonnie Bedelia as McClane's wife is felt at times, and some of the effects work is shoddy. But this is a treat for Die Hard fans and action movie fans in general. Exciting, thrilling, funny, interesting and featuring characters you enjoy being in the company of. Yippee-ki-yay. 8/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
15,Doylenf,Story about terrorists in NYC is timelier than ever since 9/11...,6,22 May 2007,"BRUCE WILLIS and SAMUEL L. JACKSON seem like they're doing a buddy flick rigged to simulate what Mel Gibson did with his LETHAL WEAPON films. There's lots of humor, excitement, explosions, daring escapes and leaps from high places as they tear around New York City trying to prevent terrorist (JEREMY LYONS) from blowing up a public school.As Leonard Maltin says: ""It's like watching 12 chapters of a hi-tech Saturday matinée serial all at once,"" with non-stop action piled onto a thin plot that has the bomber using his threats as a diversionary device so that he and his army of goons can use dumpsters to load gold from the Federal Reserve Bank.Both Willis and Jackson have to undergo a number of physical hardships and beatings to attempt any number of athletic stunts they're forced to perform in the course of tracking down the riddles they're given by Irons. Irons, it seems, is intent on using ex-cop Willis as the target of his demands because he threw Lyons' brother off a roof a few years previously. That's about the depth of character involvement we get.But since the film is all about action, any fan of this genre is bound to get their money's worth. All the stunts are elaborately staged, the color photography (particularly of New York City's congested streets and bridges) is excellent and Michael Kamen's music wrings the most out of every explosive situation.Summing up: For thrill seekers only, but don't expect credibility when the brutal punishment Willis and Jackson take makes it improbable that they survived their mission intact. There's a comic book feel to the whole movie because all the action is over-the-top.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
16,LeonLouisRicci,Enduring and Timeless Entertainment,9,12 June 2014,"This Movie was Made back when Action Movies were Rated R and Contained Bloody Violence and Foul-Mouthed Heroes. That has been Replaced with PG-13,CGI SFX and Washed Out Color and Wimpy Quasi-Realism.Watching this Film in 2014 the Difference is Profound. The Old-School Way is more Gut-Wrenching, Visceral, and the Result is a Movie with More Staying Power. These Things had Weight brought about by a Look that is Firmly Grounded and Not Ethereal.This is a Strong Return for Director John McTiernan whose Filmography Contains at Least Two Titles that are Absolutely Incredible. Die Hard (1990) and Predator (1987). This one is No Slouch Either although it is a Return to Form more than a Breakthrough Genre Reinvention. It has its Weakness, like the Ongoing Racism Dialog between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson that Wears Thin Quickly but is On Screen Throughout so it is Necessary Baggage. But there is so much Energy and Excitement that it doesn't Hamper the Entertainment, Much.The Pacing is Pulse-Pounding and it is a Non-Stop Nail Biter that is the Second Best in the Die-Hard Series, with the Villain (Jeremy Irons) Contributing (""I am not a Monster...although I sometimes work for Monsters"").Note...Some ink was used to criticize the Movie for its building explosions because it was released soon after Oklahoma City and the first scene was almost cut, but cooler heads prevailed and it was left in.

It is a little repetitive at times, but there is plenty of on-screen chemistry between Jackson and Willis; their challenges are a little more cerebral and amusing and the plot builds well until quite an exciting, if just a little too far-fetched, denouement with a baddie whose voice we ought instantly to have recognised on the phone.

18,poolandrews,"I love this film, maybe the most entertaining Die Hard of them all.",9,4 January 2008,"Die Hard: With a Vengeance is set in New York City where cop Lieutenant John McClane (Bruce Willis) gets caught up in a deadly game of cat & mouse with mad terrorist bomber Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), holding the city & police department to ransom with the threat of large bombs going off in very public places John is forced to go along with whatever Simon says, also along for the ride is Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) who inadvertently helped McClane escape from one of Simon's traps & becomes part of his game. As McClane & Zues race around the city doing everything Simon says the police are busy searching schools for a huge bomb planted in one Simon's attention turns to the Federal Gold Reserve which has been left totally unguarded...Co-produced & directed by John McTiernan I will say straight away that Die Hard: With a Vengeance is my favourite Die Hard film, I will maybe accept that the original Die Hard (1988) is perhaps the slightly better film but as far as I'm concerned I think Die Hard: With a Vengeance is my overall favourite & I'd sooner sit down & watch this again than sit down & watch the original again. The script by Jonathan Hensleigh is the single most action packed film I've ever seen, from the opening couple of minutes which we gets some cool views of New York City which is suddenly & unexpectedly interrupted by a huge bomb going off to an action packed climax featuring an exploding helicopter & McClane uttering his iconic line 'yippie-kay-yay mother f-cker' Die Hard: With a Vengeance never, & I mean never lets up for a second. Beside being the most action packed film I've seen Die Hard: With a Vengeance wisely tries to do something different with the whole Die Hard scenario, after Die Hard 2 (1990) which was very similar to the original film Die Hard: With a Vengeance feels much fresher, the whole Christmas thing is absent, McClane's annoying wife is nowhere to be seen neither is that reporter Dick Thornberg & the film isn't tied down to a single location as the action takes place all over New York state. I also think it was a great move to give McClane a sidekick to work against, the fact Zeus is black & there's a certain racial tension between them is used to very funny effect & the whole mismatched partner thing has been done to death but rarely as good as it is here. I just love this film & I cannot think of one single bad thing to say about it, it moves like a rocket, there's enough action to fill a dozen lesser Hollywood blockbusters, it also has a nice edge to it as there's some funny dialogue & plenty of bad language as well as plenty of hard bloody violence which the latest in the series Live Free or Die Hard (2007) was sorely lacking.Director McTiernan is back on-board after directing the original Die Hard & he turns in a breathless roller-coaster ride of an action flick, has it ever been bettered in terms of pure adrenaline pumping action scenes? The only time it became really silly was when McClane & Zeus seemingly fall 100's of feet onto a metal cargo ship container which in reality would have broken every bone in their bodies but hey, it's just a film right? Almost every type of action sequence you can think of is here, car chases, shoot-outs, fights, huge explosions, jumping onto moving trains & boats, surfing on top of huge dumper trucks (!), train wrecks & a taxi ride through Central Park in a cool sequence amongst many cool sequences. The violence is pretty hard & bloody at times, from slashed throats to bad guy's having their heads shot off. The profanity is also very strong (as long as your not watching one of the awful censored UK versions) with the constant use of the 'F' word, it does lead to some very funny dialogue & exchanges between character's though!With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 one has to say you can see all that on screen, in fact watching it again last night I would have thought it was a 100 plus million budgeted film. Considering past events I very much doubt a film about a mad terrorist setting off bombs in New York would get made today, luckily it was made in '96 so we weren't denied one of the greatest action films ever due to unfortunate events. Willis was paid a cool 15 million to reprise his role & he puts in a great performance, no-one can say a one-liner like him! Samuel L. Jackson is very funny as well & puts in another fine performance, I could just watch these two shout, swear & argue with each other all day!Die Hard: With a Vengeance is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest action film from the 90's & certainly one of the best ever made, it's literally none stop. I mean if you want action then this is the film for you, I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about it. To my eyes Die Hard: With a Vengeance is just about the perfect action film & it's as simple & straight forward as that.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
19,lastliberal,Willis and Jackson shine!,7,7 April 2007,"There are great buddy flicks out there - Mel Gibson and Danny Glover probably define the genre; and, there is plenty of action in all the Die Hard flicks, but this film combines both in a package that is a pure joy to watch. Bruce Willis (John McClane) and Samuel L. Jackson (Zeus) make an outstanding combination in a film that has non stop action as they try to catch the brother of Han Gruber (Die Hard), Simon (Jeremy Irons (Elizabeth I, Kingdom of Heaven).McClane and Zeus stretch the limits of believability in taking a beating in this film. You just can't believe that McClane can even get up after his last beating, much less run and jump.So, if you want to see two stars shine in an action vehicle with great dialog, this is your pick.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Still fairly unoriginal and one-dimensional, but not as predictable as Die Hard 2, with better action sequences and special effects.Bruce Willis is his usual action-hero self in the lead role. Samuel L Jackson, fresh from his success in Pulp Fiction, does a good job as the sidekick. Jeremy Irons, better known as a dramatic actor, does a decent job as the evil villain, complete with compulsory German accent.Die Hard 4.0 was just as good, but #5, A Good Day to Die Hard, was very poor.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
22,Boba_Fett1138,Truly one of the best action movies ever made.,10,4 January 2008,"Who would had ever guessed that after the disappointing standard action sequel ""Die Hard 2"", the third entry in the Die Hard-series would be such an infinite amount times better and actual be amongst one of the best action movies ever made. Yes, I even find this movie to be better than the first ""Die Hard"" movie. I don't think a lot of people expected a third Die Hard movie, 5 years after the last entry, and they surely didn't expected much good from it. But all I can say that John McTiernan has really did it again!John McTiernan plain and simple used to be the best action director in the business in the late '80's and early '90's. He made many hits but he made even more flops though, which sort of gave him a bad reputation in the business. Lets hope he starts making good movies soon again, because when he makes a good movie it's not just something good, it's really GOOD. This movie was perhaps his last really good movie, as of yet. He's in top shape and gives this movie a lot of pace and adrenaline pumping action. Even the sequences in which no action is occurring makes your adrenaline pump, due to the fine action film-making style of McTiernan. You also have to watch this movie in perspective. It was made in 1995, in those days the Micheal Bay's and the Jerry Bruckheimer's of the business didn't made any real BIG action blockbusters yet. The Lethal Weapon- and the Rambo movies were the only real big action movies of that time, with occasionally also a Schwarzenegger flick thrown in. Mostly the type of overblown action movies in which the good guy never runs out of ammo and explosions and crashes were being shown from 3 different angles in a row, all in slow-motion. In that regard ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" was a real refreshing action movie, that feels more realistic, mostly thanks to the anti-hero John McClane but also the style of filming and the handling of the action. This also was like THE biggest action movie ever made at that time.But what really made the movie great to me was its story. It begins as a fun and sort of adventurous game in which New York City is the playground. McClane has to solve all kinds of riddles, to avoid a terrorist from setting off bombs hidden in the city. The terrorist that also happens to be the brother of Hans Gruber, who McClane threw off the Nakatomi building. It however soon becomes obvious that this is not what the movie is going to be about and it's not just another revenge flick and it's just a diversion of a way bigger terrorist plan. It's a cleverly constructed and build-up action movie, that will also offer some surprises.It's not just an action filled movie, it also has lots of comedy in it, which adds to the reason why this is a very fun and pleasant one to watch. The fun mostly comes from the Samuel L. Jackson character. He and Bruce Willis form a mismatched buddy-duo, which also makes this movie an action buddy-flick, only more cleverly disguised and less obvious than similar conceptional movies, of which so many got made at that time.Out of all the Die Hard movies, this is perhaps the one that requires the most acting from Bruce Willis. He does a good job with it and his character is also perhaps the most likable in this one. Samuel L. Jackson is also just great as always. Jeremy Irons perhaps plays his most villainous role in this movie and what a great truly memorable movie villain it is! He also does a good job with the German accent, even though the actual German spoken in this movie is mostly incoherent gibberish. The movie also benefits from it that for the first part of the movie only his voice is featured. He of course has a great distinctive voice!This really is how an action movie should be like; fun, fast, adrenaline pumping, action filled, not too over-the-top, exciting, tense, surprising, good actors, likable main character and NO love story thrown in to it! This movie has really got it all! The perfect action movie and truly among the best of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Die Hard with a Vengeance
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Eh... boring, humorless and lacks intensity; so action-less that I don't think it can be classified an action film",5,24 June 2004,"*Some heavy spoilers, but confined to one single paragraph, and clearly marked*This is, by far, the worst in the Die Hard Trilogy. We meet John McClane once again, but now he's no longer funny, he's just a pathetic jerk, who you wouldn't pity if he was dying slowly from a horrible disease. He's given a new ""unlikely partner"", much like the two previous films... only this time, it's an obnoxious, annoying, whiny, cowardly, loudmouthed black racist, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers an unbelievably unappealing performance. I know this character was supposed to provide comic relief, but most of the time I just felt like knocking him out, if not for anything else, then at least to shut him and his incessant complaining up. The previous two films had action, shoot-outs, chasing, intensity... this has some lame car-chases and a very, very, very, far too long goose-chase that lasts throughout most of the film. The two characters run around, from one bomb to another, but the audience never really feels any actual intensity, or feels that they are in actual danger, since it's the same thing, constantly, over and over.WARNING! SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE NEXT PARAGRAPH! DON'T READ THIS UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!What are we supposed to care about, exactly? The kids, who defy logic and play card games when they've been instructed to follow the cop? Besides, what is there to fear in the movie? Half of the bombs are duds, anyway. And the premise is exactly the same as it was in the first film; Germans who pretend to be terrorist, but who are really just thieves; they kill the guards and put English-talking German thieves in place of them.SPOILERS OVER.The film has two or three actual shootouts, and each of them are horribly filmed, as well as the rest of the film. It looks like it was filmed by a kid with a home-video camera. The action was also dull and uninspired. Almost all of it consists of car-chases, and these are some of the most boring of them. Normally I'm not into car-chases at all, but at least Blues Brothers and The Matrix Reloaded put some effort into it. The humor is pretty much the same as in Die Hard 2; nearly everybody has some lame one-liner, if they're not spouting old clichés. The film bases almost all of the action on the long goose-chase, which relies entirely on twists, which means that, at best, you can enjoy watching it once, because the next time you'll know what happens, and you'll just be sitting and staring at the awful camera work. I've seen cheap independent films that are better filmed; honestly. The end is probably the worst cop-out I've ever seen, and definitely the most anti-climactic end ever in an action movie. It's like lighting some very expensive fireworks, only to find out that it's a dud. If you are going to watch this ""action"" film, against my best advice, be sure to watch it for free; this is in no way worth spending money on at all. All in all, just a lame excuse to make money off of the Die Hard franchise, without actually paying any kind of respect to the characters or previous films(unless ripping off the formula from the first is considered respectful). I don't recommend this to anyone, since I have no idea how anyone could possible find just a little enjoyment or entertainment value in this cinematic garbage. I don't know... maybe if you have really low standards, zero expectations, and you enjoy looking at big explosions that happen for no particular reason other than to show off pyrotechnics... you could give it a try. But don't say I didn't warn you. 5/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
24,view_and_review,If Only They'd Stopped Right Here,8,26 August 2020,"If the ""Die Hard"" franchise had stopped with ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"" then it would have been one of the best trilogies of all time. For my money, up until the ""Die Hard"" franchise came out with ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" it was right behind ""Star Wars"" IV, V, & IV, ""Back to the Future,"" and ""The Lord of the Rings.""After Los Angeles and Chicago, John McClain (Bruce Willis) has made his way to New York. DHWAV is a throwback to the first ""Die Hard."" No, they're not in a high rise, but another ruthless German is the nemesis, John McClain is being assisted by a Black guy, and he's back to having a filthy tank top (it didn't start off filthy).The addition of Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus was worth two points out of ten at least. Ever the funny s*** disturber, Jackson's witticisms were a perfect compliment to Willis's.In this episode an arch-bad guy named Simon (Jeremy Irons) is making McClain and Zeus run all over New York to solve riddles and disarm bombs. In the meantime, McClain has to try to figure out what's Simon's endgame. We get plenty of action with plenty of back and forth between the costars and it's nothing short of laugh filled rollercoaster.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Bruce Willis is obviously the star of the film and this his best work. Samuel L. Jackson really showcases that he can play any role and do it extremely well, which is why he has been involved in so many great films. Straight up action films aren't my go, as they're often pretty empty, lacking heart and any deeper thought other than what's being shown.

27,HotToastyRag,"Exciting, action-packed, and funny",7,15 July 2019,"While Die Hard with a Vengeance is very exciting and action-packed, Bruce Willis's character starts the movie incredibly stupid, blaming his lack of thinking on a bad hangover. Maybe the filmmakers thought the audience would have forgotten all about the first movie seven years earlier, but was that really likely, since that movie was so beloved it was the reason everyone came back to watch the sequels? When the featured terrorist in the third movie starts speaking in a German accent, that's a clue to the audience to remember the first movie. Everyone in the police station keeps hammering it into Bruce's head that this bad guy has a personal beef with him, and they ask him repeatedly if he knows if anyone with a German accent might have a score to settle. How can he be that much of an idiot not to remember?Anyway, once you get past that, and once the bad guy is revealed, you can rest assured the movie will be very entertaining. Teaming up in an innocent bystander, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce has to jump through impossible hoops set up by the German villain to stop bombs from exploding all over New York City. Except the usual from the third installment in the Die Hard series: tons of action, violence, explosions, broken glass, chase scenes, and of course, comic relief one-liners. Since this is the first time Bruce Willis gets a teammate, the comedy is far more easily scattered between two people interacting than one person shouting into a walkie-talkie. This one's really fun, so don't miss it if you're having a Die Hard marathon with your friends. Plus, Jeremy Irons is the bad guy, and as you know if you've ever seen him in a movie, he plays a villain very well.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence and racial language, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend.

The race theme, could have been toned down a little, especially without the inclusion of why Zeus brother was killed, but it does make the pairing a little more intense.With a neat little,twist referring the first movie, and Irons best panto villain, DHWAV is the franchises second best entry, thanks to tight directing by Mctiernan, exciting set pieces, and a brilliant pairing with Willis and Jackson.A brilliant sequel, and a brilliant action movie.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

The first one had a better plot and was more tense, but this one moves at a very fast rate and it seems like it is over before it begins. A vast improvement over part two, this movie once again finds McClane in the middle of an emergency situation. This time, unlike part two, though it is very reasonable that he is involved as Irons character is the brother of the lead villain of the first Die Hard. Throw in a very funny Samuel L Jacksoncharacter and you have the makings of a great film action wise andcomedy wise too. This one centers around a mad bomber, threatening to blow up several places including a school if officer McClane does not play the game. McClane must do whatever the bomber says and boy does the bomber do a lot to get our hero down. Great action is a given as our hero desperately must try to find the bombs. Multiple car scenes a cool scene on a boat, and loads and loads of gold thrown in for an exciting ride. Irons is great as the villain, as was Rickman in the first one.

31,Wuchakk,"Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in New York City",8,20 March 2019,"RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by John McTiernan, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is the third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one, suspended New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) rejoins the force to tangle with a mad-but-genius German bomber named ""Simon"" (Jeremy Irons) while teaming up with a good Samaritan from Harlem (Samuel L. Jackson).This franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.""The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns.""""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" evades that ditch because it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing scenes, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because the original film took place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others, including this one, which was the best up to this point.It starts out a little shaky because Simon's shenanigans are so contrived they're unbelievable, but if you can persevere the story builds momentum and there are surprises. Even John and Zeus' conflict-habituated relationship has a story arc with Zeus being bluntly confronted with his reverse racism. The sometimes contrary camaraderie of John and Zeus is great.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in New York City; Berkeley County, South Carolina; and Jessup, Maryland (ending).

Another typical action movie, but I like the water Jug part.  I hope many of you can guess the mystery, my mathematically inclined friend did, and myself a little after the movie.

Also, that it's another Gruber and another heist angle.

35,JamesHitchcock,"Well-made, enjoyable example of the action thriller genre",6,5 January 2009,"The cinema's first generation of tough cops- Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry and Walt Coogan, Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt and the like- started to appear in the late sixties and early seventies. Bruce Willis's John McClane, along with Nick Nolte's Jack Cates and the characters played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, was part of the second generation which started to replace them in the 1980s.""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was the third film in the ""Die Hard"" series. It opens with McClane under suspension for some unspecified offence (a fate which often befell Harry Callahan as well, although in his case his offence was normally performing his duties with excessive zeal). Following an explosion in a city department store, a man identifying himself as ""Simon"" telephones the NYPD and threatens that further explosions will follow unless McClane is recalled to duty.In colloquial usage the phrase ""with a vengeance"" means something like ""to a very high degree"". The use of this phrase in the film's title, however, also contains a pun on the more formal meaning of the word ""vengeance""; it transpires that Simon is the brother of Hans Gruber, the German terrorist killed by McClane in the first ""Die Hard"" film. The police therefore assume (incorrectly, as it turns out) that Simon's obsession with McClane is linked to a desire to avenge his brother's death. Simon forces McClane to race around the city, solving riddles and performing a series of absurd tasks, warning him that further bomb explosions will follow should he fail in any of these assignments. The plot thereafter becomes very complex, but Simon's plan is to make a false threat to blow up one of the city's schools, thereby distracting the police by from his real purpose, which is to steal a vast amount of gold bullion from the vaults of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.A feature of second-generation tough cop movies was that they often teamed together a white detective with a black partner, a theme pioneered in ""In the Heat of the Night"" from 1967. Thus the ""Lethal Weapon"" films team together the black Roger Murtaugh and the white Martin Riggs, and in ""48 Hours"" the white Cates was assisted by the black criminal Reggie Hammond. In ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" McClane's unofficial, and reluctant, ""partner"" is a black shopkeeper, Zeus Carver. With the police preoccupied by Simon's threat, it falls to McClane and Zeus to thwart his plot to steal the gold.Like Eastwood, Willis has created one of the iconic action heroes of the cinema, and their creations have certain things in common. Both are insubordinate, impatient with their superiors and take a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" attitude to crime. There are, however, differences; Callahan is an ascetic, a widower whose obsession with crime may stem from the fact that his wife was killed by a drunk driver. McClane, who is separated from his wife, is a slob, a chain-smoker and heavy drinker, ""about two steps shy of becoming a full-blown alcoholic"".This film, like the original ""Die Hard"", is also different in style to the ""Dirty Harry"" series. (I have not seen ""Die Hard 2""). Most of the ""Dirty Harry"" series, especially the first film, were not just action movies; they also asked some serious questions about the ethics of law enforcement and vigilantism. The one which came closest to ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was the final episode in the series, ""The Dead Pool"", which attempted to combine action with comedy. Unfortunately, that attempt was never a very successful one, and I was never sure whether ""The Dead Pool"" was intended to be taken seriously or not.""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", by contrast, has its tongue quite definitely in its cheek, although that does not mean that there are no thrills; the action sequences are very well done and provide plenty of nail-biting moments. The mixture of excitement and tongue-in-cheek humour means that the film has some similarities to a James Bond film, albeit one set in the world of policing rather than espionage. Jeremy Irons' Simon is the sort of over-the-top megalomaniac who would be very much at home as a Bond villain; his scheme to corner the world's gold market, for example, is reminiscent of Goldfinger's. This role came as something of a surprise to me, as I had normally thought of Irons as an actor most at home in deeply serious films like ""The Mission"" or ""Waterland"". There is nothing deeply serious about ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", but it is nevertheless a well-made, enjoyable example of the action thriller genre. 6/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance

37,Smells_Like_Cheese,Almost as good as the first Die Hard,9,8 August 2004,"I have to say that I was really impressed with this Die Hard film, the trilogy has just been an awesome one. This time we have a new partner, Samuel L. Jackson, who works so well with Bruce, they have such a great chemistry as partners in the film. Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a worthy sequel of the original Die Hard. It has great action, a terrific story, and in some ways it's just a fun comedy. I loved how John just wouldn't stop complaining about the aspirin since he has a hang over from the night before. Especially his line when he finally gets aspirin from the main villain, it was just priceless. I think you'll definitely love this Die Hard if you are a fan.John is no longer at base one in life, he's actually farther behind I think, he's pretty much lost everything since his nasty drinking problem. He's suffering from a bad hang over this one morning and things get worse when he is threatened by an unknown villain to stand in the middle of the worst ghetto city wearing an offensive poster, right as he's about to get his butt killed, Zeus, a shop owner helps him out, but ends up getting involved. It turns out that the villain is Hans Gruber's brother, Simon Gruber, who is about to do everything his brother supposedly did wrong and will get the money. But John is going to make sure that he puts the Gruber name to shame.Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an excellent action movie, it was a lot of fun and I couldn't believe how well it was made. Sam and Bruce are just perfect together. Jeremy Irons could not be more perfect for the role of Simon, he and Alan are so much alike where they have the most awesome voices for super bad villains. Yes, a little typecast for being a British villain, but it's all good, I think. I highly recommend Die Hard: With a Veneance, it's a great movie and a great end to the trilogy.9/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
38,MovieAddict2016,"Is ""Yippee Ki Yay Mother ******"" an Understatement?",10,27 May 2003,"""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is a full-blooded action vehicle; it is a smart one, too, because its filmmakers realize the ol' one-man-army-trapped-in-an-area routine can't last long. So they have changed the technique to a game of revenge; cat-and-mouse. Some could call it smarter than its predecessors; and on a level as a thriller I must admit it is more intense. It is a lot better than the 1990 Renny Harlin actioner ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder."" But on terms of fun, you can't beat the original.John McTiernan, who brought us ""Predator,"" ""The 13th Warrior"" and ""Die Hard,"" returned to end this series on a high note. Of course, like all sagas, ""Die Hard"" is far from over, with another sequel due to be released summer 2004. But until then, we can look to ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" as the end-all to the overall excellent John McClane trilogy.The third film opens up where nothing left off; McClane (Bruce Willis) is on the streets of NYC when a man who calls himself ""Simon"" blows up a Manhattan department store, and then orders McClane to stand in Harlem with a sandwich board that says...well...something you wouldn't want to be wearing in Harlem. After a convenience store owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) saves McClane, Simon orders both men to run around New York City and do Simon Says-type-games. It's all good fun, and a step away from the original film. Which can be good or bad.Soon McClane finds out that ""Simon"" is really the brother of Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) from the first film, and that ""Simon"" is out for revenge against McClane (or is he?), and he will stop at nothing to kill McClane. But, of course, being a madman, he plays mind games with John McClane first. And the simon says mind games are tense, taught and action-packed.It's hard to compare something like this to the original for one major reason: It is nothing like the original. The original was about a lone man fighting off a million guys, Rambo-style. But what saved it from becoming another average action spectacular was the great dialogue, non-stop SMART action sequences, and engaging performences by all aboard the project. Fast-forward two years later and you've got a replicant copy of the first film set in Dulles airport in Washington, D.C. But in all respect, ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is not recycled. Its technique is new, and it almost seems as if it is not a sequel to the other ""Die Hard"" films. Which is probably not too odd, seeing that the script, originally titled ""Simon Says"" (no, not the Dennis Rodman one), was actually a sequel to ""Lethal Weapon."" Of course, moderations were made after the ""Die Hard"" series bought out the script, but the character of Zeus was probably Danny Glover, and John McClane was probably Mel Gibson. Thinkabouddit.Bruce Willis is still John McClane. This film takes his character into a bit of a darker realm; McClane now has an alcohol problem, and his wife has left him again. Man, you'd think after having your life saved TWICE by the same guy that MAYBE you should stick with him. In fact, we don't even see McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedalia) in this film at all. Notta. Zip. Although we are led to believe they will hook up again at the end. Just wait until the next film, I saw.Samuel L. Jackson adds some flair to the film, taking the movie into a more cop-buddy dimension (""Lethal Weapon""). Jackson's character is a racist, and it's a bit odd to see a black racist in a film. It's usually those nasty white fellas. :) I liked Jackson's character, because it provides for dialogue outlet on McClane's behalf, and sets the film up for some very funny sequences. The character interaction is a lot stronger here than it was in ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder.""""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is hard to compare to the original because it is so very different. But the bottom line is that this sequel is much better than ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder,"" but a step down from ""Die Hard."" But seeing how different it is, you might think it is better than both the films. It really depends on your preferences.I give this solid action film a solid rating of 4/5 stars - an all-around solid action sequel. Solid fun.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
39,disdressed12,Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson team up,6,16 February 2008,"of the first three Die Hard movies,i liked this,the third one,the least.i think manly because there wasn't very much action,but i also didn't like the story.i just thought there was too much going on.plus,i found the movie too long.it wasn't any longer than the first two movies,but i didn't feel the pacing was very good.plus,this movie doesn't really do a lot to distinguish itself from other movies of the genre.i did like Sam Jackson is his role as a shopkeeper who ends up helping John McClane.i thought he was funny and a good fit for Bruce Willis.i also thought Jeremy Irons was good as the man villain.Graham Greene is good too,in his role as a cop.This movie is missing Bonnie Bedelia,who played McClane's wife in the firs two movies.even though she didn't have that big a role in the other two films,i thought she was great with what she had.anyway,this isn't a bad movie by any means,but it's just not as good as number two,and nowhere near as good as the first one.for me Die Hard:With a Vengeance is a 6/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
40,KineticSeoul,2nd best in this franchise so far,8,21 February 2013,"This is the 2nd best installment in this franchise so far, unless ""Die Hard 6"" pulls something out of this world. It's exciting and fast paced all around. Sure it's probably the most implausible ""Die Hard"" movie out of all of them which is saying something. But the thing is, it's still entertaining. And it didn't get to the point where it got annoying or irritating to watch and that includes the random coincidences throughout this flick. Bruce Willis is back as John McClane and he still has all that characteristics John McClane. Who is this tough smartass that taunts his enemies no matter what situation he is in and is a badass while doing what he does best. And this time around he has a real partner, not really a sidekick but a partner. Who goes by the name of Zeus Carver and is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Who is a black version of McClane but isn't as physical but still more patient and to a degree more intellectual. And he is a badass as well. And it was cool to see them go around New York City ""Grand Theft Auto"" style trying to save innocent civilians from bombs and take down the bad guys. The main villain this time is Simon(Jeremy Irons) and he is just great in this role. In fact he is probably the 2nd best villain so far in this franchise. He is like the The Riddler from BTAS and Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Well not the complete package from both of those villains but a little of both. In fact it would have been cool if the ending went in a different direction. The way one of the writers decided to end the movie. So maybe they could have picked it back up in ""Die Hard 5"". This is directed by the same director that directed the first ""Die Hard"" which is why a lot of the elements that made the first ""Die Hard"" awesome is still intact. Overall if your a action movie fan this is a one that is really worth seeing.8/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
41,OllieSuave-007,Third Die Hard is a race against time!,7,25 March 2014,"""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is the second sequel to one of the best and iconic action films from Hollywood, returning Bruce Willis as NYPD Officer John McClane, who tries to prevent terrorist Simon Gruber, brother of Hans Gruber from the first movie, from stealing billions of dollars worth of gold from the Federal Reserve. Along the way, McClane must follow Gruber's ""Simon Says"" games, or else he will set off a bomb after each unfinished puzzle. Willis' witty and deadpan delivery personality continue in this movie, along with his Yippie-kai-yay attitude and relentless attacks on the bad guys. Graham Greene, Colleen Camp and Larry Bryggman play some of McClane's colleagues at NYPD Headquarters, each giving a memorable performance, and I liked how they each took on a large role in helping McClane with the mission. Samuel L. Jackson plays Zeus Carver, a Harlem electrician who happens to be caught in the chaos and ended up attempting to help McClane solve the case. I didn't care for his character too much; he's helpful to McClane but keeps on spouting annoying and endless racial references. Jeremy Irons plays a formidable Simon Gruber - crafty, sly and skillful, and commanding with his wicked voice. I just wished the aspect of him being Hans Gruber's brother, and the climatic fight between him and McClane, were elaborated upon more, which would have made the revenge subplot more interesting. His henchwoman, Katya (Sam Phillips), lacks some descent acting skills and is too theatrical when wielding her weapon in an attack, as in the overbearing scene where the henchmen raid the Federal Reserve with the song ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" running continuously in the background. Overall, it's another sequel full of suspense and thrills, with a chilling race against-time-scene towards the climax. It's another edge-of-your-seat ride, but just falls short of equaling or surpassing its prequels in entertainment value. Grade B-",Die Hard with a Vengeance
42,thesar-2,Enjoy Summer in this City,9,15 May 2009,"It's a pity 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' didn't make a bigger splash at the box office. This movie was great. I've seen this installment more times than any of the other 3 'Die Hard' films with good reason: hilarious dialogue – from both Willis and Jackson who steals every scene he's in, exciting plot, character development, original explosive scenes (way before 9/11, obviously – in fact, I'm sure, following the real life '01 terrorist attacks, New Yorker's had a hard time watching this) that held very little CGI – the real way to make films and a great archenemy, Irons, who also stole his scenes. It was great to see a 'Die Hard' film predominately in daylight, or any action film for that matter. And to add both enemy and hero alike suffering from massive headaches made it all the more real. Sure, it wasn't perfect: some plot holes were bigger than the wounds inflicted by Willis and some scenes were pretty laughable, even by 1995's standards – watch the water filling the tunnel, a la 'Escape from L.A.' But, still, watching John finally teaming up with the master of bad-ass – Jackson, was worth every minute. It was also refreshing to see an off-white racist for once, as they do exist, but rarely shown in cinema. Predictable, yes, and as part 2 demonstrated, if the big spoiler isn't obvious with the first viewing, it's painfully evident in this chapter. Finally home in NYC, McClane (Willis) is sent on a cat & mouse ""Simon Says"" deadly game with Zeus (Jackson) all across the city, ditching the claustrophobic atmosphere of the first 2 installments all the while Simon (Irons) sets traps, a plan and plays God. Fun, lighthearted, great action sequences, and definitively not to be taken too seriously, this is an absolute must watch.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
43,FeastMode,my notes,6,27 July 2019,Good movie with good action and great chemistry between willis and jackson. probably my favorite of the first three (about 2 viewings),Die Hard with a Vengeance
44,Robert_duder,A sub par effort in a historically incredible action series,7,8 July 2007,"Now I am writing this having most recently seen the fourth installment Live Free or Die Hard so I am surrounded by the brilliance that was Die Hard, Die Harder and Live Free and With a Vengeance does hold a candle or small lighter to any of the other installments. It's my opinion that Die Hard With a Vengeance was rushed and put together to get another Die Hard out there although I must give it respect for holding a certain amount of 'Die Hard' fans if you'll excuse the pun because I know there are people who have a great deal of respect and love this entry and kudos to them because With A Vengeance has some very unique and important details about it. It is now a decent bridge between Die Harder and Live Free because John McClane is divorced from Holly, a barely functioning alcoholic, suspending from the NYPD, but he jumps right back into action when it involves saving lives and kicking bad guy ass without barely questioning it. This is the first time McClane gets a real sidekick in the action with him, something they continue in Live Free or Die Hard. It also bridges the first and third films by bringing a villain into the mix who supposedly wants Vengeance for the death of his brother Hans Gruber (played wickedly by Alan Rickman in the original Die Hard.) Most of the Die Hard elements are here but yet the story is a little more...well story. With A Vengeance seems to focus more on the actual story than the action. Compared to the other three films With A Vengeance is very, very light on the action despite opening up with a big bang. It appears to go more for suspense, thriller, and dialog then the typical action sequences of the other installments.Still you can't say anything bad about the master of the action film Mr. Bruce Willis who brings his kick butt action hero John McClane back and is still watchable, fun, and one of the best action heroes in history. Say what you will about Willis and his acting ability (although personally I think he's a terrific actor) the man is a presence on screen and makes the film worthwhile. Enter the first real side kick for John McClane. Who could possibly be man enough to put with up with McClane's antics? Samuel L. Jackson, one of the coolest mutha %#$#&*&! on the planet. Jackson plays street wise, white hating, store owner Zeus Carver. Now Jackson also gets the character with the most story, background and interesting plot line as he is forced to work with someone he doesn't like in order to save innocent people. Carver and McClane are practically identical. Willis and Jackson have great chemistry together and Jackson doesn't take the spotlight away from Willis which he could easily do. Zeus Carver becomes a Die Hard icon. Jeremy Irons continues the villainous terrorist streak by portraying Simon Gruber. Irons is appropriately evil and has no thought to innocent bystanders (although spares a school of children mostly for his own fun.) Irons is the perfect Die Hard villain for certain. He is right up there close to Rickman. Larry Bryggman, and Graham Greene are the forefront police officers on the other end of McClane's walkie talkie and they do a decent job as well keeping in time with the Die Hard recipe.The cast are all great. And there is enough interesting moments in the film to keep you interested but it just doesn't put you on the edge of your seat like every other Die Hard film has done. The story is a little slower, a little action focused and too much time is spent establishing the ""big bad heist"" going on. On top of that I don't think the fight sequences that do exist are nearly the quality you'd expect from Die Hard. This is all very surprising seeing as how original Die Hard director John McTiernan returns to the helm. But then McTiernan has since fallen into the same trouble with other films he has directed, too much story in an action genre. You can still a great story and still have intense action (Live Free or Die Hard for example.) Die Hard With A Vengeance just seems to drag and I know many will hate me for saying it but it just doesn't live up to the other installments. That being said it has to be seen...case closed...it's an important entry into the series and a 90's classic so you can't not see it...just don't have high expectations and you'll be fine. 7/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
45,ElMaruecan82,With a Vengeance ... and Minor Flaws ...,8,14 November 2011,"The ""Die Hard"" series is governed by a simple but infallible pattern, John McClane, no matter which situation where the average Joe would have 0,0001% chances to come back in one piece, he's put in, he will survive. Indeed, John McClane is so inhabited by his innate heroic status dictating the fact that he's always the 'Man-of-the-Situation' that the question is never whether he'll get alive or not but how he will. The ""Die Hard"" series is all about the 'how', the spectacular reason-to-be of the series that would be so boring if McClane wasn't so fun to watch. That's why no matter how unrealistic some parts are, the movie provides the same level of old-school action-driven fun and enjoyment as another series about a charismatic macho hero named James Bond.Let's develop now the idea behind the 'how'. The ""Die Hard"" films' appeal essentially relies on their ability to create surprises. The first one, released by John McTiernan, not only succeeded in that exercise, it became a landmark in the action genre, paving the way for the classic ""average Joe movie heroes vs. elegant sophisticated movie villains"" antagonism, this now-dated cliché was ""Die Hard""'s innovation. The second film, released two years after by another director: Renny Harlin, was a good continuation of the first: set in Christmas too, with the same plot, and John McClane saving a day  where so much more lives were in danger (and the film is known for having a particularly impressive body count) Now to the third, it was released five years later by John McTiernan again, a predisposition for being better than the second? Maybe  but I still regard the second with higher esteem.""Die Hard, with a Vengeance"" delivers what everyone would expect from a ""Die Hard"" film, without even recycling the same plots that would have made it another Christmas disaster. This time, the film is set in a hot Indian summer day, in New York City. While the thrills of the first two films were largely conveyed by a feeling of claustrophobia, this time, the most frightening aspect of the enemy is his ubiquity. The movie starts with a spectacular explosion in the middle of Manhattan that sets the tone of the film, it's not a hijacked building or airport, it's the whole town, and more specifically, it's John McClane's territory. For the first time, he's at home. There will be basements and elevators of course, but also tunnels, subways, highways, chasing taxis, derailing trains, surfing trucks in a fast pacing that gives the profound feeling of a journey in hell (a subtle reference to the movie's French title) But these are only minor bits of originality when compared to what makes the third opus really different from the first two. The first and most notable one is revealed in the title, a vengeance, and again, it is less about who gets the revenge than how he does. The villain played by a Jeremy Irons at the top of his game, will play with McClane through many riddles and intellectual games, one of the little things we most remember from the film. And this playful vengeance only serves a much more masterminded plot, which, after all the pieces of the puzzle get assembled constitute one hell of a creative plot. After all, you don't take a whole town with hostage without having invested some time to elaborate the scheme, one that makes Hans Gruber and Colonel Stuart look like amateurs.The second aspect is the partnership with Samuel L. Jackson, as Zeus, a store owner involuntarily mixed in McClane's cat-and-mouse game. Zeus's prejudiced views on racial issues and his dislike for McClane aren't fooling anyone, we all know how this duo that looks like a combination of ""The Last Boy Scout"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" will end. But Jackson is such a charismatic actor that when he outshines Willis, we're able to detach ourselves from McClane and see him with more partial eyes. And their interactions get even more delightful when they try to solve one riddle involving some water jugs. If only, for these bits of creativity, I sometimes enjoy ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" a bit more, although it does kill off the charm of the series by featuring probably 90% of the most unrealistic impossible-to-survive sequences. McClane might be 'James Bond' superhuman but he's not Superman, don't you remember his bleeding feet in ""Die Hard""? This is the movie's forgivable weakness, despite all its originality, it could have been titled ""Die Hard With a Partner"", ""Die Hard in Town"", ""Die Hard with a Telephone"" or ""Die Hard without Holly"", the movie doesn't avoid the blatant action-films clichés that would made it unworthy to have its title beginning with ""Die Hard"" and I'm not talking about unrealistic stunts. The villains-monologues, the decision to kill the hero with a bomb or to beat him to death instead of shooting him in the head that makes you wonder why the villains always have to kill poor sentinels or harmless looking guards in a straightforward and quite gruesome way, and give John McClane the benefits of a bare hand fight? There are a few moments like this where ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is objectively inferior to ""Die Harder"", let alone ""Die Hard"". And believe me or not, despite all this, I would still have given the same rating as number two if it wasn't for   a particularly weak final confrontation. I don't mind anticlimactic sequences, but when the most spectacular moment in the movie isn't the last one, it's really disappointing. This time, I wished ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was a bit more conventional, and I don't think it was too much asking from the fans.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

47,g-bodyl,Best One Out of the First Three!,9,3 January 2009,"This Die Hard film is another great, action-packed movie in a series with tons of action and terrorists. This is the best film of the first three movies. There is more action, better actors, and the terrorist played by Jeremy Irons is a bit more twisted and evil.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane. He is drunk, suspended from NYPD, and on the verge of splitting up with his wife when a terrorist calls the NYPD asking for McClane. The terrorist, Simon Gruber tells MCClane to go to Harlem with a sign referring to hating black people. He gets joined by a black owner of a electronics shop. They and the police have to bring down the terrorists while they play games with them.This movie has the best acting. Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint as the racist owner. Jeremey Irons is the perfect villain. He gives me the creeps playing the game-loving terrorist.There is much more action than the previous film. In fact, this movie starts with a building being blown up.

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,It's boom-time in the Big Apple.,10,18 August 2012,"Summer 1995, what a time to be an impressionable 14-year-old. I pity kids these days who are bombarded with CGI PG-13 garbage when I had Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 to warp my young mind. It was an eventful summer, but Die Hard with a Vengeance was THE big release for me.Set five years after the lackluster Die Harder, McClane is now back with the NYPD, only he's been suspended for being a miserable, smelly drunk - making him even more of an underdog hero. Basically, he's got no dignity left, but Hans Gruber's brother Simon still intends to cast him down even further.A department store in Manhattan goes boom, proving that Simon has the firepower and the moxie to deliver his threats. If McClane can jump through humiliating hoops for him in a high-stakes game of 'Simon Says' the day will end with no further explosions, but the tasks Simon sets for him are virtually impossible, making McClane suspicious that the revenge plot is just a ruse for something bigger.In the course of his ritual humiliation McClane meets Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson in his 3rd of many movies with Willis), a Harlem handyman who he strikes a tenuous but eventually warm friendship with. Together they tear through New York, a wide-open playground filled with outrageous set-pieces in pursuit of Simon.John McTiernan (a REAL Die Hard director) stages some ruthless action scenes, perfectly edited, perfectly shot, and with some clever touches you might not notice if you switch your brain off. Die Hard 3 is a template for how proper, R-rated action films should be made. One thing I particularly like is that McTiernan keeps all of the action shot from a pedestrian point of view. There's virtually no establishing shots of New York, a city already overdone with helicopter flyover shots to transition two scenes together. Peter Menzies' wonderful anamorphic Panavision photography, with its naturalized color pallet and wide angles is a million miles away from how action movies are shot these days. Future filmmakers need to study how older, better movies were made and John McTiernan's Die Hard movies are the best examples.Also returning for the third time is Michael Kamen, delivering a fun, exciting score that is made even more enjoyable thanks to his completely wonderful rendition of 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home'. Wisecracks, humor, swearing, blood squibs, a great villain, and a smart story - this IS a summer action movie, and the last true Die Hard film.And keep a lookout for an appropriate Loaded Weapon reference.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

52,The-Sarkologist,Now the franchise is wearing a little thin,4,25 December 2011,"Honestly, I did not like this movie. It is enjoyable right up until the subway incident and then it begins to go down hill. When I first saw it I thought that is was dull. The second time I saw it I thought a little better but the first two movies are much better. The director, John McTiernan, who is know for his action movies, and the creator of the original movie.This movie is well received by some critics, but not by me. The plot in the movie has its twists and is interesting, but the final confrontation is incredibly disappointing and left me feeling rather disappointed at the movie. The stunt scenes aren't really that fantastic, though the opening explosion is quite impressive. Simply we have a little light music, and everything is normal in New York City when a bomb explodes in a department store. Then they say it goes for a roller coaster ride of action, and it is in a way. We have a cab driving through the middle of Central Park, a wall of water chasing a truck down a tunnel, and two men jumping from a bridge onto a ship. As with Tiernan, there is the fair share of explosions as well. In Die Hard they blow up a building, in Die Hard II they blow up three planes and in this one they do it in a subway train and a ship. This movie is basically all about explosions.McClaine (Bruce Willis) is the main hero and he inadvertently picks up a sidekick Zeus. They meet in an interesting way. The bad guy Simon (Jeremy Irons) gets John McClaine to walk through Harlem wearing a sign that says ""I hate Negroes"". That is something that most sane people would not do. Zeus, who doesn't particularly like white men, ends up saving McClaine and joining him on his deadly game of Simon Says. As is also typical of Die Hard movies, McClaine finishes the movie cut, bruised, and very dirty. He also ends up making up with his wife, though in this one she is absent from the action, while she was in the middle of it in the previous two.Die Hard With a Vengeance is a reasonable movie, but I wouldn't put it among the list of great ones.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

54,slightlymad22,My Second Favourite Die Hard Movie,9,3 January 2015,"This is my second favourite ""Die Hard"" movie. I love it, and probably watch it more than the first (which is my favourite) mainly because it is a summer movie not a Christmas one.Plot In A Paragraph: John McClane (Bruce Willis) is now almost an alcoholic and is suspended from the NYPD. But when a bomb goes off in a Department Store, a man named Simon (Jeremy Irons) calls, states it was him and asks for McClane. Simon says that McClane is going to play a game called ""Simon Says"". He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he'll set off another bomb. With the help of Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) a Harlem electrician, McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out all the puzzles.Samuel L. Jackson is a great addition to the cast, and has great chemistry with Willis, who is also in top form in his most famous role. It's nice to see Colleen Camp again, last time I seen her was in ""Smokey & The Bandit 3"" and the ""Police Academy"" sequels so it had been a while.

56,Floated2,Great action paced,7,22 December 2018,"Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third film of the Die Hard franchise, and quite different than the previous two. We see Bruce Willis return as the resourceful cop with a knack for survival. In the first two, McClane stumbled into situations outside his jurisdiction and had no choice but to save the day.This time, he's at home in New York City when a maniac setting off bombs directs his rage at McClane. He's got to save the day again. Here we see a slightly co-starring appearance from Samuel L. Jackson, which may have stood out.The film is quite clever with the directions from the villains regarding what John McClane must do with the orders sent, as it is entertaining to watch then complete them. The chemistry between Willis and Jackson is what elevates the film as a whole, perhaps not better than the original but there is still some decent amounts of entertainment and joy. As a rewatch 08/09/19' this third film of the franchise remains very solid.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
57,johnnyboyz,"Everything you'd expect out of a blockbuster, including any flaws.",7,5 January 2008,"I suppose Die Hard: With A Vengeance is a little bit of everything rolled into one. It is certainly all the things you'd want in an action film condensed into one complete package but the good and the bad both flow with each other. Die Hard: With A Vengeance is a basic and routine film on the scale of things with certain conventions and ideas slightly dumbed down with others being pushed outwards. I remember first seeing the film several years ago and being totally blown away by the opening thirty minutes or so  whilst most other films take their time in setting the scene, who's who and what the situation is, Die Hard: With A Vengeance blasts you with rock music, shows you some quick edits of New York and then hits you with its initial incident: a bomb in a busy street.The reason I mention the time when I first saw it is because after that initial explosion and chain of events, I felt the film settled into a groove of repetition and grew not dull but perhaps one dimensional. One advantage of starting slowly and doing everything by the book is that the film can finish strongly; the first and second Die Hard films are good examples of this with a lot of other 'buddy' films doing the same thing. Die Hard: With A Vengeance starts not at the twenty-five minute mark but at the twenty-five second mark; never letting up and although this works for the film, it can also work against the film. But to say the film is a failure is untrue as Die Hard: With A Vengeance does combine enough action, impressive set pieces and dialogue to quench the blockbuster thirst. The film uses the black sidekick device to get across its laughs and its protagonist-on-sidekick scuffles to good effect; something the Lethal Weapon films did rather well but regarding Die Hard, the sidekick is actually physically next to McLane (Willis) throughout the film, unlike in the first two when Al Powell and the controller in the control tower acted as the links via radio control in the first and second films, respectively.The idea of creating a sidekick for McLane that is both ally and foil is a clever one. Powell was always trying to aid McLane in number one; as was the controller in two and Farrell in the recent fourth addition. Here, Zeus Carver (Jackson in a memorable role) is so cooked up on racism and possible racist remarks that he will explode at the mere hint of any discrimination. Examples are found in the scene when the guy on the subway phone refers to him as 'bro' which enrages Zeus who was calm up until that point; another example is the taxi customer who mocks Zeus for apparently not accepting the fare because he is white, which forces Zeus to take the obnoxious fare on a taxi ride he won't forget. ""Don't ever let people use you."" He says to two kids in his shop at the beginning, thus hinting at how he will take McLane's and the police orders. Also, the character of McLane himself seems to taken onto another level. Instead of action hero like in one and two, director McTiernan starts McLane off as a sort of down and out noir anti-hero since he's suspended, wife-less and close to alcoholism: a man in internal ruin. There is also the reoccurring joke about McLane and modernity: in the second film, he says so himself that he should ""move into the 90s"" as he operates a fax machine; in the fourth addition, he is likened to an analogue watch in a digital age. Here, he curses cell phones as he is cut off in a tunnel. It's a well known fact the police usually operate on two way radios, something that would've worked in that situation. McLane seems old fashioned in a metaphorical sense but also when it comes to his methods of dealing with the situation at hand; but he is successful. Person 'A' could write an amazing screenplay on a typewriter whilst person 'B' could write an abysmal one on a computer: it's how you get the end result that counts, not what you use to try and get there.In terms of narrative, the film uses a familiar cause and effect method of getting across its story. A recent film entitled Cellular is probably the best of recent efforts at exploiting this idea and it works in Die Hard: With A Vengeance to a degree. There are enough action set pieces to make the film feel truly epic with the race across New York through traffic and a public park to get you excited. The scene in the unfinished tunnel is also rather exciting with Simon (Irons) attempting to drown McLane. Not only this, but certain tasks engage the audience; challenging them to work it out; asking them 'How do you do it?' or 'what would you do now?' A good example is the scene by the fountain and the four gallons of water with a three and a five gallon jug. I had that worked out once but since forgot it. The film also makes good use of its New York location with that particular scene taking place amongst a backdrop of seemingly real people. There is also the subway, the park and the motorways used to good effect. Die Hard: With A Vengeance is a film that will entertain on a certain level but there are some frustrating incidents in which everything is moved forward clumsily. The editing seems a little brisk at times and there is a lot of shouting as the film moves along at such a pace but that aside, Die Hard: With A Vengeance is fun, engaging and a well written blockbuster; the likes of which are rare these days due to certain, tragic events.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
58,filipemanuelneto,Action with a slight smell of comedy.,7,27 July 2016,"This is the third film in the series ""Die Hard"", which runs around the character of John McClane. In this film, he will face a terrorist group seeking revenge on him, specifically, by placing bombs in several places of New York. Directed by John McTiernan, the film has a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh. Bruce Willis takes the lead role.This film marks the return of McTiernan to the director's chair and managed to be different from the previous films. Addressing racial issues with humor, the film has good comic moments between McClane and Zeus, a seller from Harlem that takes racism too seriously and, eventually, become the main sidekick of McClane.Bruce Willis managed to shine again in a role that he knows well, but the spotlight was also turned on Samuel L. Jackson (who played Zeus) and Jeremy Irons, who gave life to the main villain. The eloquent and precise combination of the three actors was very important to the success of the film. The script also deserves congratulations: besides introducing humorous moments with great intelligence, also fled the pattern marked by two films, where Willis worked alone and out of his jurisdiction, to save his wife and the other people who were with her in danger. The time element is crucial to the film: with McClane working against the clock, the adrenaline flows freely and quickly infects the audience, which is attached to what is happening on the screen. The special, visual and sound effects are good, the picture is also positive.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
59,damianphelps,Makes up for Die Hard 2,8,18 December 2020,"Not that Die Hard 2 was horrible but it was a significant drop from the original Die Hard.
The addition of Jackson provides some much needed depth that was sorely missing in number 2.
This time you have 2 arseholes butting heads against each other and the bad guys.
I'm note sure Irons was the best choice as the super villain but he does well enough.
Lots of amazing action of course and some genuine laughs relaunch the franchise back in the right direction.Although old it holds up pretty well :)",Die Hard with a Vengeance
60,digitalbeachbum,Could have been a lot better,4,4 May 2020,"I'm going to put in as much effort with this review as the writers and director did with this movie.It isn't really terrible. There are some good things in it, specifically in the very start to around the middle of the movie. After that it all falls apart and feels rushed.Filled with fallacy after fallacy, continuity errors, deus ex machina and a rushed, unrealistic ending, this movie sort of sucks. There are some great individual scenes which stand out (like the sign in Harlem) and some of the chase scenes.That's it. It sort of sucks. It's OK to start then it is unsatisfyingly stupid at the end",Die Hard with a Vengeance
61,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The thrill of the original comes back with a vengeance,8,30 July 2009,"After massively underestimating how to follow-up the first ""Die Hard"" film, John McTiernan was the one who took back the reigns ... with a vengeance. Although it deviates from the one-location danger scenario of the first two films, deciding to take a crazy hell-bent ride around New York City, it brings the winning elements that disappeared in ""Die Hard 2"" and brings them back while adding bigger action and suspense.After giving up control of the director's seat to Renny Harlin for the ""Die Hard 2"" in order to make ""The Hunt for Red October,"" McTiernan, couldn't have been pleased to see the direction the franchise was going and it must've contributed to his decision to produce ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" almost five years later. It's a good thing, because if a third Die Hard had been greenlit by anyone else, the results probably wouldn't have been the same.Taken from a Jonathan Hensleigh script that was once it's own film called ""Simon Says"" and changed to fit the character of rebellious cop hero John McClane (Willis), ""With a Vengeance"" definitely feels like its own film. A few elements are carried over, such as the villain is the brother of first movie baddie Hans Gruber, whose name is Simon (Jeremy Irons), but the premise is unique to the franchise. Instead of one location like the tower in the first and the airport in the second, ""With a Vengeance"" makes New York City its playground and challenges McClane with riddles and time trials to avoid civilian casualties. It's different for the series, but Hensleigh works in McClane nicely and even gives him a bad-ass buddy in Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus Carver, a Harlem electrician that gets dragged into McClane's mess and accuses everyone of being crazy ""Pulp Fiction""-style.Most important is the return of a distinct antagonist. ""Die Hard 2"" did not have a strong villain and McClane's peril did not seem as pressing. If cinema has learned any lesson from the James Bond franchise, it's don't let your antagonist go faceless. ""With a Vengeance"" learns this lesson and insures itself by making this villain related to the one in the first film. Irons is great. Not Alan Rickman great, but great.""With a Vengeance"" is full of exciting action sequences from taxi drives through central park (on the grass, that is) to an explosion in the subway. The riddle-me-this thriller does seem forced, but there's certainly no lack of excitement and the twist halfway through makes it all well worth it.The only thing to dislike about the movie is it's harsh confrontation of racism. Jackson plays this white-wary black man who makes everything about race. The Lethal Weapon series has always been fine just pairing a white and black cop, but the script awkwardly forces this racial dialogue into ""With a Vengeance"" instead of making the tension between McClane and Carver just natural personality clash.But it's a big upgrade from ""Die Hard 2,"" and for the other fans disappointed with the sequel, it apologizes for that quite well. I suppose ""Die Hard"" 'purists' who wouldn't approve of McClane having a ""partner"" in this movie or its riddle-oriented structure might not enjoy it as much of the original, but on the entertainment scale, it's easily on par.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
62,Anonymous_Maxine,The return of John McTiernan!!,9,10 November 2008,"I was pretty thoroughly disappointed with Die Hard 2, but that might have made watching Die Hard 3 even better, because it was so good to see such an immediate and clear improvement over the first sequel. The movie begins in Harlem, where a terrorist has forced John McClane to go wearing a huge sign with a slogan on it that is sure to get him shot in minutes. The villain is Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, the bad guy from the original movie, and he plays a vicious game of Simon Says with McClane, forcing him to do things that endanger his life. Gruber has detonated a bomb in a department store and asked the frantic police for McClane by name, intending to play games with him and ultimately avenge his brother's death.Things have not been going well for McClane. He's been suspended from the force, his marriage is falling apart and he's now a full-blown alcoholic. It is only Gruber's personal request for him that brings him back into use from the police force, and Gruber has him running frantically around New York with the unwilling company of store owner Zeus Carver (a brilliant performance from Samuel L. Jackson), who wants nothing to do with McClane but is coerced into going along.The action is brilliant and the story lives up to the original, with McClane ultimately figuring out that the cat and mouse game that Gruber is forcing him to play is a ploy to distract him and the rest of the police force while Gruber pulls off a much greater crime. A couple of brilliant plot twists and a slew of great performances are a great sign for the Die hard series, which was headed in an unflattering direction after Die Hard 2. See this one!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
63,imseeg,New York is bigger than Die Hard with a Vengeance,9,31 January 2018,"This Die Hard with a Vengeance movie is the only Die Hard sequel really worth seeing, because the original Die Hard is so incredibly good that it is hard to live up to. For anyone who loves big action movies this sequel is an excellent choice! Guaranteed good time.The story of this sequel is really clever. Lots of funny unexepected twists and turns. The action is over the top like it should be in any Die Hard sequel. The acting of Jeremy Irons and Samuel Jackson is superb and Bruce Willis is as funny as ever.As a tourist from Europe I vistited New York when Die Hard with a Vengeance was just released. I took a cab in Manhattan and I couldnt believe what was happening when my cabdriver followed a speeding ambulance through traffic. Wild stuff. Then I went to see this Die Hard movie in a New York cinema and realized that my cabdriver had been copying a scene from the movie ! I love New York !The good: this movie is highly recommended for ANY action comedy fan, because this sequel is BIGGER, BOLDER, WILDER and FUNNIER. What a joy (again and again) to keep watching this rock hard ACTION CLASSIC!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
64,jzappa,"""Are You Aiming For These People?!""",8,23 May 2010,"A fitting ta-ta to what should've remained the trilogy of lovingly crafted action thrillers, Die Hard with a Vengeance is about as good as it gets among the 1990s Hollywood action cycle. True to the Die Hard formula, Bruce Willis' crass old-school New York cop John McClane takes on a situation way over his head in roughly under a day's time. The charm of With a Vengeance is that it takes place in McClane's city, where McClane is in his element, but not. We see the crass old-school NYPD itself, resolving issues and doing detective work with profane exclamations, matter-of-course Styrofoam coffee cups and worn-out suits they've probably been sleeping in. It follows the old custom that hero cops are either suspended or should be, but that is not the opposition to McClane's as-the-crow-flies brand of individual police work. It is something much more complex, and personal.I'm aware that Jonathan Hensleigh's script in the form of Die Hard 3 has been reworked from a potential Lethal Weapon 4, from there having been reworked from an original script called Simon Says. Regardless of whatever inevitable contrivance that was necessary to assert franchise characters into his original plot, the result is one of the very best-written Hollywood action-adventures of the '90s. Yes, there are some holes. One might go as far as to say the plot under real scrutiny is Swiss cheese: Our classy villain Simon could not have employed his necessary camouflage justification for his complex plan as long as required without arousing doubt among the police, which he would've had McClane been snuffed during his first chore in Harlem, which could've happened without any difficulty. That is the one major thing at variance with Simon's otherwise fail-safe plan, but then no one who is aware or becomes aware of the Federal Reserve incident either recalls, or finds it gracious or worthwhile enough to bring up that billions in stolen gold is laying in the Aqueduct following an explosion.Nevertheless, in spite of it all, Hensleigh's screenplay transcends any boilerplate situations or characterizations with unique, and thus less predictable and more exciting, turns on their heads. The most prominent of these is Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's unwitting and unwilling shopkeeper partner Zeus, an ingenious departure from the buddy-cop blueprint. Upon his encounter with McClane in Harlem, he has no reason to like him, or believe what he finds he's gotten himself into, and yet he has little choice whenSimon says. Zeus has a racial chip on his shoulder, and for him to confront the reluctant and terrified McClane in the sadistic scenario Simon has forced him into, is to make a gesture of pure social conscience and shows various levels of humanity, automatically making him an exceptionally sympathetic character. And when he and McClane begin to bond, in their own cynical, acidic New Yorker ways, over the course of this phenomenally chaotic day of explosions, gunfights, helicopter catastrophes and unrelenting German soldiers, we feel we have seen real characters go from profoundly resenting to profoundly respecting one another.The movie follows in the Reaganite blockbuster tradition of streamlined stunts and nonstop million-dollar set pieces of mass destruction, and they do rock, but scenes of dialogue and deduction are not mere bridges between those extravagant tableaux. Two irrevocably hostile and deeply imperfect people thrown together in a city of 8 million people like McClane and Zeus, an Irish Brooklynite cop and a black Harlem electronics store owner, bound not to get along much, are given thirty seconds to crack ancient nursery rhyme riddles and yet they just can't stop fighting and cursing each other. Mathematical problems and other brain busters segue back and forth between the problem at hand and the personal problems they have with each other. But they end up using their heads in ways the other didn't expect. They end up inextricably necessary to each other to foil Simon's plot, which all holes considered turns out to be rather brilliant.Yes, Die Hard with a Vengeance is a real pleasure of its kind. McTiernan's back in the director's chair, and Jeremy Irons returns the series in the direction of classy, well-mannered villains, bad guys whose intentions are highly intelligent and mostly plausible, and who are scary because they are so nice to you when they talk. Even though they are threatening various lives and have comparatively mean thugs pointing guns at you, you still want to have a cup of coffee with them. It's difficult to say Rickman as Gruber in Die Hard 1 was anything but peerless, but Irons is a formidable comparison, I must admit. Iron's Simon is not a recycling of Rickman's Gruber. His mannered behavior is also not quite as infectious. But Irons, a powerful actor all his own, is his own fascinating, multi-dimensional beast, a soldier whose purpose and scheme are engraved like clockwork in his mind, from Plan A to Plan B all the way down the line. But what is his purpose? We think we know until there's yet another revelation, but what of the first revelation? It's true to some extent, but where do his ideals truly lie?",Die Hard with a Vengeance
65,videorama-759-859391,"A supercharged Die Hard, 95 style, that still holds it's own",9,13 December 2014,"This third entry is such an adrenaline pumping ride, by the end of it all, you feel totally exhausted. Something about it, sets this one apart from the other two, this one a longer time span from the second entry. This is such a fresh third entry, and we are riveted from the word ""Go"" and if you're a revenge fan, it's an added bonus here. Part of the scenario has John Maclaine's past catching up with him, and that it does, in a cleverly constructed scenario that has the chief villain, terrorist Simon Gruber (a fantastic Jeremy Irons) create a diversion, using our hero, to act upon these requests (the first ones a killer, using the N word, hence the start of Jackson's arrival) and working out riddles and math, what have you. If these answers and demands are not met by the set time. BANG! Certain parts of the city, will go off, an example of Simon's deadly work, we see in the opening. So while Maclaine is being played for the schmuck, Irons and his henchmen are taking down the federal bank. The name Gruber is familiar, because he's the brother of the chief terrorist, from the original, and he wants a little payback, as he's still a little bit sore I guess, about what went down. This is such an energy driven Die Hard and watching maddened Irons being ridiculed by Maclaine, just how we like him, is although I would of loved to see the fight in the finale. Hey, I love to be ringside seeing that one. Samuel L Jackson as a store owner, Zeus, who unwittingly gets caught up with Willis in this diversion, is a guy I'm glad who did, and these rocking actors really worked well together. I liked the lethal femme fatale too, one of Iron's mob. I choose this one over all the other Die Hards. Strap in for this one, cause this great action piece will tire you, where mostly we have Maclaine to owe for that one.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

67,taylorkingston,Another great John McClane movie...,10,25 April 2015,"I love Die Hard. I love Die Hard 2 (Die Harder) and I honestly remember this movie as really not that good. But then I re-watched it during my Die Hard marathon, and I realized that I was completely wrong. This movie really holds up. With the added acting of Samuel L. Jackson, this movie has everything it needs.This movie is about John McClane, for a third and not final time. He is living in New York City, almost a full-blown alcoholic after his wife has left him and to top it off, he get suspended from his job from the NYPD. But then, a bomb goes off and soon a man calls the department wanting to talk to McClane. The man gives him riddles and sends off on ""assignments"" or wild goose chases in order for ""Simon"" to not set off anymore bombs. McClane does this with his new ""friend"" he meets after he is made to do something very racist in a very dangerous area. Eventually, it is revealed that Simon is Hans Gruber's brother, from Die Hard. They think Simon wants revenge. And he does. But he wants the gold he is stealing whilst everyone is busy tending to the bomb sites, so much more. John figures out what he's doing and stops him leading to a lot of blood and swearing. This movie is just fantastic.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
68,hellraiser7,Hot time to die in the city,10,19 December 2019,"This is my second favorite in the series and another one of my favorite action films of all time.I really love the plotline, as usual with the Die Hard films it feels plausible, from the way it's handled whose to say no criminal organization had this in the back of their mind. It's true a bit of the scheme isn't too different but nothing wrong with that, what really matters is in its execution as an old saying goes if it's not broke don't fix it.Though it's also true that some parts are a little comic bookish but that's not a bad thing as it reminds us that despite the ""Die Hard"" franchise being down to Earth it's still a movie. Though I'm a little surprised that this plotline wasn't used in the ""Batman"" film franchise as this feels like the kind of scheme ""The Riddler"" would do, maybe in the future they'll consider it. On a side note this plotline was going to be for another ""Lethal Weapon"" sequel which might have been interesting but I'm glad all the same this was in the ""Die Hard"" franchise.Really like the setting of the film from the fact that it's set in New York this time which makes sense as it's McClane's hometown and his career's there. Also, the fact this time the film takes place in the summer time and not Christmas, which I'm fine with didn't want things to feel too formulaic. Also, both New York and summer time is fitting for this film, despite summer being a time for vacation, rest and relaxation, it can also be the most stressful time of the year. From not just the heat but crime which spikes up even faster than the heat during that time most notably in the big cities which of course makes New York the perfect arena.Music is good, like the use of the sone ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" which ironically fit in both ways, but mainly the song ""Summer in the City"" as the theme song for the film which fits like a glove for this film. I'll admit ever time I hear that oldie but goodie, I always think about this film.Characters are great there is a colorful cast, from the main villain Simon Grubber played by one of my favorite actors Jeremy Irons and this is one of my favorite roles from him. He's another villain on my honorable mention of favorite fictional villains but my second favorite main villain in the ""Die Hard"" franchise.I really bought him as Hans Grubber's brother Simon whom just like Hans has the same aims as him but also there are slight differences that set him apart. Like the fact he's not a ruthless as Hans however just like his brother he's just as much a skilled chess player as he's a step or two ahead and doesn't let everyone on all his scheme. He's not as ruthless as Hans but he's not afraid to take anyone out that gets in the way and tries to ruin his plans.Really like his German accent which sounds sharp, well mannered and sinister. The guy runs his scheme in a sort of military fashion as he has a well-coordinated operation and well thought out plan he is executing at the right places at the right times. But what I really like about him is that he's sort of a cat that likes to play with his food, as he is constantly giving John several challenges to the point where if the challenges don't kill John he will.Zeus played well by one of my favorite actors Samuel L Jackson. This film was one of the films that helped put him on the map and it was a good choice. I really love his character as it's pretty much Sam sort of being Sam.His character and John have one thing in common as he's a reluctant hero that really didn't ask to do any hero work but he sigh's, grits his teeth a little and does it anyway as no one else can or will which is understandable as stopping bombs isn't on my to do list either or any other sane person's list. Another common thing is both have charisma, but Zeus's charisma is different as his is more of a tough aggressive attitude, where he doesn't take crap from anyone, one scene I like is when he shoos a suit jerk away from the phone when that guy makes a small offensive comment; yeah serves that jerk right.Though we see Zeus has a slight Achilles heel as he has prejudicial slightly antisocial attitudes, though this doesn't deter from his humanity as he doesn't wear these attitudes like a badge which is why we can forgive him for it as we understand where he's coming from, much like with Archie Bunker in ""All in the Family"" but that's a different story. And this whole debacle you can say was one hell of a way for Zeus to learn to get along as prejudice would be the killer.And of course, John McClane played well by Bruce Willis. As usual John is himself as he is the usual reluctant hero that really doesn't want to do this but must as he's forced once more to play the game.However, we see John is in a bad place in his life right now as you see from the beginning he looks and feels like crap. From getting suspended for who knows what we never really know but whatever it was it wasn't good. His marriage is on the rocks again though this time it's bad. And he of course throughout a bit of the film he's had a bit of a bad hangover, as he's had more than he can handle yesterday. And of course not any closer to winning the Lotery.Which in a way makes some of John's plight sort of his slight journey to redemption and the terrorist attack seems to be one hell of a start on that road and let alone with his current personal situation, what the hell else is he going to do.The film by its nature is sort of a buddy cop movie as we see both John and Zeus are on the fence with each other. The back and forth between both is just great. Both we see really clash with one another and don't get along too well. Yet both do work well together and as the film goes further alone, we see both slowly but surely get along as those clashing attitudes start to cool down along with Pete's plans as they both get closer.The humor is great, it hits in the right places and times and is memorable. There are just so many fun moments between both McClaine and Zeus. Like seeing both in a cab going though the park and then in a dialog scene Zeus says, ""Are you aiming for these people"" and McClaine says, ""No, well maybe that mime."" That always makes me snicker. Or even seeing both McClaine and Zeus jack bikes from juvenile shoplifters, all I can say to those shoplifters is serves them right.The action is great the film plays out like a live action video game as we see both McClaine and Zeus just constantly on the move, having to get from point A, B, C and so on. And we they are doing it any way they can and have a whole city to work with which sort of reminds me of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" video games well sort of and this film was years before those games.The suspense really excels from both the physical challenges that McClane and Zeus must get through but also there thought provoking at the same time with he riddles that Peter serves both of them. Though if your good with riddles you might easily be able to solve them before the protagonists do as we know the solution to riddles is simple, they just don't seem that way as first.There is as usual that double layered suspense as we see Peter and his villain army are conducting their theft operation. We are a step ahead of McClaine and Zeus and are hoping both will not just play though Peter's game and survive but also along the way catch on to Pete's true plan and get a step ahead of him. And we also need both McClaine and Zeus to help us fill in the blanks on some other parts of Pete's plan he hasn't let us in on.The only dud the film has for me is McClaine I don't feel gets to kick a lot of ass in this film. Ok, yeah, he does but I mean there aren't really that many physical confrontations. Would have liked to of seen at least one or two intense shootouts or even another kind of chase where McClane he must chase down some of the dump trucks with the gold trying to escape and their shooting at him and he shoots back.But this is just a very tiny dud, as McClaine in the film does have some physical confrontations where he gets to kick some ass, so some is better than none. And due to the films pacing and seeing both McClaine and Zeus constantly on the move doing things I hardly noticed so I really can't complain much.This entry to the series is a hot actioner with a vengeance.Rating: 4 stars",Die Hard with a Vengeance
69,elshikh4,"It Can Be John MacLean's Hottest Day, But Not The Best !",7,14 November 2009,"I'll tell you a story. I watched the first 3 (Die Hard) movies many times. And I discovered this: the first was the best with its logic sense, explosive action, romantic core, pioneer role and huge affect. The second is repetitive and illogical, but still fun. Less fun. And the third is yes, better than its antecedent, but with problems that don't make it as good as the first.This round, the direction was gold. (John McTiernan) made the wild action so wild and believable in the same time (what could be cuter?!). He pulled off portraying tension in visually attractive way. And thank God that at the moment, Hollywood hadn't been cursed with the CGI yet. (Bruce Willis) as the reckless, resourceful, and sarcastic (John MacLean) was super. And with (Samuel L. Jackson)'s character and performance, it's ultra super. I know that (Jeremy Irons) maybe did it for fun, for money, but for me (Simon Gruber) is one of the best roles he ever did, let alone being the best villain in a (Die Hard) movie, being charismatic, cool, and scary. (Michael Kamen)'s music embodied the feel of a cliffhanger after another, with unpeakable boiling point (here's a new word for you!). And the image doesn't look less boiled itself, which's something you'll highly appreciate after watching part 4!Maybe it was (McTiernan)'s desire to outclass himself, revenge for handing the second part over director else him (so that's another meaning for the word ""vengeance"" in the title!), and achieve big and unforgettable action show. Since the first one took place in a skyscraper, the second took place in an airport, (McTiernan)'s aim was clear: this one will take place in EVERYWHERE! I remember in one of the action movies' godfathers (That Man from Rio - 1964) the lead, played by (Jean-Paul Belmondo), drove maybe all the known vehicles. Here, I think the intention was that (MacLean) would ride a car, a big truck, a metro train, a ship, a helicopter, and yes.. a bicycle, all in one day. Great ambitions, which were greatly delivered. So what's wrong with this movie anyway?!While the script was smart in dealing with action, thrill, and twists--the plot thickened badly somehow. The mad bomber with a hidden agenda, who wants one cop to run all over the city solving his Simon-says riddles, was all perfect stuff. But there were some events that I didn't comprehend well unless after a third viewing. There is a collection of action sequences that run fascinatingly on screen, but while many things are running dry, especially in the last third. For instance: the exposition scene before the tunnel sequence was annoying and difficult to understand, after the lead came out of the tunnel he meets his partner in a magical coincidence, and if the villain ordered killing the lead by artificial flood then who ordered the armed guys in the pickup truck to kill him in the rain?!Moreover, the character of (Zeus Carver) got involved in the events' hell so easily, without a powerful motive. You must have asked yourself why he didn't decide to leave anytime?! I believe not much effort was done to weave the character more smoothly. The script could have made him another detective, or made (Simon) stipulate having him in the game after admiring the way he solves riddles.. etc. But no such luck. The climax was too laconic compared to the movie's rest. A bullet to an electric wire, ""Say hello to your brother"", then BOOM, was not an appropriate ending for all what we were watching till that moment. It seemed like they ran out of money to make a real ending. And, needless to say, that the continuous profanity, and awful violence, didn't / don't / won't make my day, or normal human either!The editing must have had hard time to gather all of that action, comedy, within the heist. And it managed to create a hot funny character for the movie. However, since the third act, surely I got a bit lost. The concoction is perceptible at places, the cliffhangers are too many at others, and despite the noisy case and the places' changing, it failed to make you forget that the plot twist, concerning the villain's true goal, was the same of the first 2 movies!At times, it's like a breathless football match, more than a movie. I hate it when the action movie doesn't care about anything but giving us pure action exhaustingly. I think that's where the problem of this movie exists. Sometimes too much fun is a problem.Anyway, I still love it. It's so hot. Maybe more hot than the first. But that just outwardly. Because in the final analysis, it's too crowded, too fabricated, and too empty to be the best.P.S: Among many moments I love from this movie, there is one where (MacLean) comes out of catastrophic train accident so healthy and laughing. It's such a rare moment for the cinematic hero while mocking at himself as cinematic, namely: invincible!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
70,freemantle_uk,A thrill ride of action-thriller,8,4 July 2020,"Die Hard: With a Vengeance is the Die Hard film I remember watching the most when I was younger: it was usually shown late at night on BBC One.Die Hard: With a Vengeance felt more like a sequel to the original film that the actual first sequel because it brought in the brother of the Hans Gruber. Whilst this film continued the storyline the filmmakers were able to find the balance being familiar and different. It was different because John McClane and Zeus have to go around New York as part of a demented game. The familiar came with the villain's motivations because he used a revenge plot as a distraction to his heist.Being a John McTiernan film the action was top-notch, especially all the driving around New York, and had some great practical effects like the bombing at the subway station. It was an intense thrill ride that has little yet up, because as the film progresses plotholes start to emerge.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

The premise of this film sees John mclaine going around new york in search for a terrorist who is out for revenge. Bruce Willis most famous role is definitely john mclaine and he is fantastic in this film. He is so relatable in this film and even though he isn't perfect you are rooting for him because you know he is a good cop. He is really funny in this film too which helps his character. Samuel l Jackson plays his partner Zeus and he is great in this film. He is a hilarious character and his chemistry with Bruce Willis is brilliant in this film. Jeremy irons plays the villain in this film and there is a story reason for his inclusion. He was a great villain and a very cerebreal villain that really delivered in this film. The cop characters were also good in this film. The story was good, for the first time in did hard the film isn't locked down in one location and it always keeps the audience on the move. However, I felt the ending was pretty lacklustre and was the only real negative with the film. The script was great with allot of really funny and clever dialogue which helps flesh out the characters. The style of the action scenes is great and really works. It is the most violent die hard film and it works in this film. Overall this is a fantastic action film that you should definitely see.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
74,MaxBorg89,"Could have been better, but still an enjoyable entry in the Die Hard series",7,13 June 2007,"John McTiernan, the director of the first Die Hard movie, was unable to film the sequel due to scheduling conflicts with The Hunt for Red October, but came back to do number three, which follows the Hollywood tradition of being bigger, louder and more ambitious than the previous installments. Alas, this doesn't mean it's necessarily better, in fact Die Hard: With a Vengeance is weaker than the first two films in the series, although it remains a watchable piece of violent, profane entertainment.Unlike other threequels, the new Die Hard has almost no connection with the films that precede it: apart from John McClane (Bruce Willis), not a single character from the first or second movie is still around. And McClane's situation is not one of the best: he's got a drinking problem, is separated from his wife and has been suspended from the NYPD. However, when a man named Simon (Jeremy Irons) starts bombing certain areas of New York, he demands explicitly that only McClane be allowed to try stopping him. Why? Because Simon happens to be the brother of Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the German terrorist our hero threw off the Nakatomi Towers in the first film. With this comforting knowledge, the former cop, along with reluctant helper Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), sets out to solve the various riddles his opponent has left around in the city. One mistake, and many lives will be lost. Or is that so?Not only is Die Hard: With a Vengeance larger in scope (the action takes place in an entire city, as opposed to just one building or an airport), the writers also try to make it more complex (the first two movies were rather straightforward) by suggesting Simon's primary objective may not be what it seems. This provides a few neat twists throughout the movie, and they are quite good. Unfortunately, the villain himself turns out to be the weakest link in the movie: instead of making the character his own, Irons prefers to merely imitate Rickman, turning Simon Gruber into a pale reminder of what an intriguing opponent his brother was. There are problems with the so-called ""money shots"" (action and sex) as well: some of the set-pieces, no matter how spectacular, look too contrived to fit in the Die Hard universe, and there's a sex scene involving Irons and a female villain that is completely gratuitous and unnecessary (by the director's own admission, it was included just because the film was going to get an R-rating anyway, and it shows).On the flip-side, what is nailed right from the beginning is the chemistry between Willis and Jackson: after appearing in separate sections of Pulp Fiction, the two are finally allowed to share the screen, something they take advantage of to the maximum, delivering a double act that's funny enough to rival anything Mel Gibson and Danny Glover did on Lethal Weapon (the best bit being probably Jackson's reaction when Willis explains the situation to him: ""You mean to tell me that I'm caught up in all this sh*t because some white cop threw some white a**hole's brother off a roof?"").Final verdict: as uneven as it may be, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is worth a look if you're a fan of the franchise, and by the time McClane pronounces his trademark line (one of the most quotable in cinema history) even the most skeptical are likely to start cheering.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
75,jimbo-53-186511,Back to basics,8,24 November 2013,"In this third entry in the franchise, we begin with a large explosion at a department store. The NYPD then receive a call from a gentleman called 'Simon' (Jeremy Irons) who says that he wants them to send John McClane to 128th Street. The problem for the NYPD is that McClane has been suspended and therefore they initially refuse to co-operate. However, Simon says (no pun intended) that if they don't comply that another building will get blown up. Reluctantly, they agree to Simon's demands and send in John McClane. McClane isn't keen to help out - mainly due to him suffering a bad hangover - he's not exactly been using his time constructively and has almost turned into an alcoholic (this is most probably as a result of the breakdown of his marriage to Holly). Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) ends up an unwilling partner with McClane when he unknowingly interferes in Simon's plans when McClane is stood in Harlem wearing nothing but a sandwich board with a slogan on it that upsets the locals. Simon is upset that Zeus rescued McClane from certain death and that he interfered with his plans and sees him as an accessory. McClane's inspector Walter (Larry Bryggman) decides to re-instate McClane back into the NYPD and along with Zeus they both try to discover what Simon wants with McClane; *********************SPOILERS FOLLOW*********************************The first big plus with this Die Hard entry is that McTiernan is back at the helm. This was the man that directed the excellent first film. One major strength in this film is the plot - it initially plays out as a standard revenge film (Simon was Hans brother who McClane killed in the first film). However, Simon has more on his mind than just revenge and intends to steal all the gold from the federal reserve bank in New York. Simon tells the police and FBI that he is going to blow up a school in New York if Zeus and McClane don't get to a specified destination in 20 minutes. This was used as a 'distraction' to get all of the police in one place making it easier for him and his men to steal the gold bullion from the Federal Reserve bank.Straight away, this plot has been thought through much more than the rather silly and implausible plot that we saw in the second film.Whilst this is clearly a Die Hard film, it also felt a bit like there was a Lethal Weapon cross over with McClane and Zeus being Riggs and Murtagh respectively - the only difference being that Zeus isn't a police officer. This isn't a criticism it's just merely an observation. As with Riggs and Murtagh, the chemistry was great between McClane and Zeus.The plot is engaging with plenty of twists and turns throughout. What impressed me the most about this entry was the fact that the audience are constantly left guessing; the fact that sometimes Simon was bluffing and sometimes being serious about where the bombs are located was intriguing and really helped to keep my interest. Aside from all this, it was also really entertaining. A lot of the time Simon gave them clues to where the bombs were located in riddles and it was fun seeing how frustrated Zeus and McClane were getting when trying to work out the riddles.Jeremy Irons (like his brother in the first film) was also a great villain. I personally felt Sadler wasn't quite as convincing in the second film.Overall, this is a huge improvement on the second film and is close to being as good as the first film. We have a well thought out plot which is both engaging and plausible. DHWAV is also massively entertaining and Willis and Jackson are both on top form and as I've already mentioned they both work really well together. Do not miss this one!",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Both actors steals the show in the third of the series. McTiernan tries to make the third film different from the previous two films by shooting the movie with hand-held action sequences and making as gritty also. Although the script by Jonathan Hensleigh (Armaggeddon, Jumanji, The Punisher) is quite weak at times, the second half slows down too. But it's never boring and the ending seems rushed.

Original director John McTiernan (who was noticeably absent for ""Die Harder : Die Hard II"") brings back much of the feel of the first adventure by styling this film on that 1988 box office sensation. Only this time, he doesn't keep us waiting for the action to begin.""Die Hard 3"" opens with a bang and doesn't let up until Bruce Willis has capped the very last of the nasties. Suitably, and familiarly, tang topped and bloodied, Mr. Willis supplies the audience with plenty of grunts, sweat and one-liners to wholly entertain, all the while being backed up by reluctant side-kick Samuel L. Jackson, who appears to thoroughly enjoy this departure. Now there's an actor you couldn't begin to classify. Also most enjoyable is fine English actor Jeremy Irons, who makes a great villain as Simon Peter Gruber. A shame though that he didn't have enough meat to chew on, and a shame too that we don't see the talented Bonnie Bedelia (John's estranged wife Holly) at all. Musically, Michael Kamen again supplies the fitting soundtrack, which incorporates various themes very deftly.There is enough substance in the plot to sustain a fairly undemanding audience, but this is an action movie so, thinking should not be a prerequisite to enjoyment. Of course, if outrageous stunts, violent gunplay, spectacular special f/x, brilliant sound, a high body count and plenty of gore (not to mention bad guys that can't shoot straight - what other kind are there?) is not your scene, then you'd better go see ""While You Were Sleeping"" instead!

The cinematography was jarring, but effective in many ways which were not demonstrated in the first two films. Jeremy Irons was exceptional as a villain, but let's just say he won't be portraying any Southerners any time soon. Let's just say, that accent he used was downright terrible. Whoever the accent coach was in this film should consider a career change. Anyway, the film was very tension packed, especially when Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were sent on a wild good chase.

81,davidmvining,McTiernan rights the ship,8,18 May 2020,"Well, that's significantly better. Where Die Hard 2 felt like the laziest kind of sequel, Die Hard with a Vengeance feels really fresh in comparison. It's still following a lot of the basic formula from the first film (in particular an antagonist with outwardly terroristic ends but privately greedy ones, McClane operating alone, and English actors pretending to be Germans pretending to be Americans), but there's more to the motions than simply repeating what came before. It's actually a really clever packaging of the formula that makes it feel like it's something different while still delivering a lot of the same beats. That's not to say that it's just a well dressed remake, there's a lot of other fun stuff going on as well. Aside from a few nitpicks, this is really the best of the Die Hard franchise up to this point.One of the things that sets this film apart is simply how clever it is. It starts as one movie for almost an hour and then completely morphs into another, and the change is seamless. John McClane, back to being a New York cop, is on suspension when a bomb blows up a department store in the city. The police receive a call from someone calling himself Simon playing ""Simon Says"" and demanding that John McClane perform a series of tasks or more bombs go off around the city, the first of which is to wear a vulgar sign through Harlem that will surely get him killed. In comes Samuel L. Jackson's Zeus, a small business owner who simply doesn't want to see a white man (especially a white cop) get murdered on the streets of Harlem in broad daylight, knowing that it would only invite more white cops into his neighborhood. Attached at the hip because of Simon's insistence, the two spend the rest of the first hour racing across the city to Wall Street in order to get to a payphone, answer it, and prevent another bomb going off, but the timeline is literally impossible. Through some creative driving straight through Central Park, they barely make it but the bomb still goes off.That first hour is really, really well done. We are right there with McClane, navigating the streets of New York as a very credible threat builds up around him. He and Zeus develop a 48 Hrs. type relationship where Bruce Willis and Jackson play really well off of each other's antagonism. It's taut, tight filmmaking.And then, after the bomb in the subway under Wall Street goes off and Simon places a new threat on an unnamed elementary school in the city, New York's finest very believably dedicate as many of their resources as possible to addressing this very credible threat, leaving open Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, and the movie to take a step back and show us Simon for the first time, managing a team to break into the Federal Reserve and its gold to haul away in dump trucks. The movie plays catchup, allowing the audience time to get a feel for Simon as he works his team and occasionally breaks away to taunt the police or McClane again. Hans Gruber from the first film is still a better villain, but Simon Gruber is good on his own, a definite step up from the non-entity that was Colonel Stuart in Die Hard 2.One of the things about movies like this in general is that you need to find excuses for the hero to act alone without simply calling the police or for backup. If he could just do that to help relieve the threat, why doesn't he do that? Well, Die Hard with a Vengeance answered that easily with the elementary school bomb threat, selling the reality of the bombs to both the police and the audience really well, and providing a couple of other extra explanations for why John can't simply call things in. It's a stretch of reality, but the movie sells it well enough so that it never really comes up as a question.All of the pieces propel towards the conclusion filled with great stunts and fun action. My only real problem with the film is some moments of convenience that pop up from time to time to help keep the story moving, like when McClane launches out of an underground aqueduct being flooded, flying fifteen feet up in the air, right next to Zeus who's driving along a road at the same time. The odds of that happening are not good, but hey, the movie needs to keep moving at this point and not slow down for McClane to catch a ride. I'll accept it without too much complaint.It's intelligent and preposterous in equal measure. It takes the time to sell its own reality. It gives space for all three principle characters to play off of each other. Die Hard with a Vengeance feels open and alive and better constructed than any other film in the franchise up to this point. And, hey! They got rid of the idiotic police character who only gets in John's way! I'm quite appreciative of that.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
82,PredragReviews,"""I Didn't Say Park Drive. I Said the Park.""",7,10 May 2016,"Die Hard with a Vengeance brings John McClain back to the big action and equally large laughs that made the original so successful. Willis (Moonlighting) returns as the iconic McClane and is juxtaposed with Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction) as the nervous but intelligent electrician Zeus. Filled with humor and one liners, both characters are enjoyable to watch and make the plot even more intense with witty dialogue. Like the previous Die Hard films, there is plenty of action and a fast tense situation to keep you gripped to your seats. This time, there is a mad bomber on the other end of the telephone telling McClane riddles, and these little puzzles make the film intriguing and very intense as the stakes are raised with every puzzle, and include very dramatic national panics. There is a lack of realism, but the fast flowing nature will keep you hooked.In this film some digital visual effects are used and that make the film slightly less rough because digital special effects are smoother, more easy-going, more fluid than standard old fashioned analog special effects. But we are used to that nowadays though it makes the film less impressive. A great action film, but not as clever as the first film and not as tightly put together as the second. It lost its way a couple of times and I was left feeling that of the first three films, strangely this was seemed the most outdated. Still a good yarn and never boring.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
83,eric262003,The Action Will Surely Make Your Head Spin,7,2 January 2017,"In the 1960's and 1970's in an action film the audience would get their adrenaline rush just by one exciting stunt and would leave the theatre with a smile of satisfaction. By the 1980's and 1990's, the action stunts and explosives are just non-stop you will eventually be looking for an aspirin to cure your migraines. ""Die Hard: With A Vengeance"" showcases an explosive action romp that's an action junkies paradise it'll make them hypnotized until the end of days.This third installment to the ""Die Hard"" series stars Bruce Willis returning as John McClane who's recently been suspended from the New York police force. We can tell from a scene where the chief shoves his badge across his desk think McClane is back on the prowl. When he acknowledged this analogy, people opened up with a subtle chuckle from action fans who like a little humour to go with the wild ride that's coming to them.After the very authentic looking explosion at a department store in the greater Manhattan area, McClane gets a mysterious call from an evil bomber who goes by the name of Simon (Jeremy Irons), who lures McClane to wear a placard around his body uttering a racial hatred towards African Americans. McClane gets some assistance from a Harlem store owner named Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) and now he's caught in this sickening mind games by this dastardly Simon.As simple as can be the film is not depended on acting or method. This film relies heavily on stunts, explosives and in your face to make you lose your mind. Simon's whereabouts seem to be omnipresent as McClane and Zeus are roaming all over Manhattan on one deadly mission after another (even going as far as to bum a cab across Central Park). The whole Manhattan Island seems to be infested with bombs, which also includes the subway and even a city school.But Simon's reason for his madness is not just on his own, he has a personal vendetta against McClane and he's not in on this alone. He's come equipped with his own personal army and has vengeance on John for the death of his brother from the first ""Die Hard"" movie.Willis and Jackson show some great, reluctant chemistry even though most of their dialogue was saturated with racial undertones and neither man has any kind of racial hostilities. Jackson's use of clever observations and puzzle solving is the perfect foil to McClane's manic live life in danger attitude.Near the end of the chaos were all in awe when the bomb squad members become overwhelmed when a super machine is unraveled that could cause a devastating impact that could cause terror all over Manhattan and the time is ticking fast. There's also the trivializing question of which wire to cut. Simon's plans seem to be pure genius, though it's hard to know how the trucks came to the scenes from Canada. Jeremy Irons is another long list of villains who are British extraction. He joins the faction of Alan Rickman, Tim Roth, Gary Oldman and Sir Anthony Hopkins and his rich, calculating voice has the villainy we can all love to detest.But the acting is overall very secondary as we all come to see our heroes defy death-laden assignments and the excitement will keep you in stitches. We are here to see two men slide from a bridge cable onto a nearby ship, we want to see vehicles topple over like they were Tonka toys. This movie is a kids toy car collection come to life. In the end it just delivers what it promises with a vengeance.On an afterthought, this film was released one month after a real life bombing in Oklahoma City which killed several civilians mostly young school children. As an act of humanity Willis actually refused to make references of this real tragedy in comparison to the bombings.

This is just what an action movie is supposed to look like, a compelling story with a breakneck pace that gives everyone an excuse to blow things up.

He gives orders to the duo to carry out several tasks, failing to do results in him detonating a bomb before saying the phrase ""Simon Says!"".After watching the film I have to admit it was good, not quite as epic as 2 or hell, 1, but it WAS a good film with plenty of action sequences & humour added in to keep you entertained.The ending however was anticlimactic & the score used at the epic ending of Die Hard 2 is heard. But sadly, it didn't work, at all. It came off as poor attempt to be like the ending of it's predecessor. The average action laced with the score used at the end of Die Hard 2 felt out of place & a bit sloppy.But overall this isn't a bad film, it's decent enough & good in its own way.

I'm a Bruce Willis fan and I love action flicks, but these movies just tend to be only average, in my eyes. The fourth entry was fine, the first one was decent, and the second one was alright, at best. Clearly this is a well-loved series, so I'm assuming that the problem must be with me.As for Die Hard with a Vengeance, I'd put it on par with Die Hard 2. Some aspects of the movie worked well. The connections to the story of the first movie were a nice touch, and the pairing of Samuel L. Jackson with Willis effectively turns it into a buddy cop movie. It's more entertaining seeing John McClane interacting with another character, than it is to see him going gung-ho alone. But beyond that, I just didn't think it was very exciting or interesting. There are plenty of late 80's and early 90's action movies that I absolutely love, but I can't add this to that list.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
88,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Effectively reversing most of what happened in the first two films,",8,15 March 2008,"Effectively reversing most of what happened in the first two films, It is no longer Christmas Eve, it's the dead of summer, in the middle of a drought. McClane is not in some foreign territory, he is back home in Manhattan. He does not catch on to another terrorist type of plot. A terrorist bomber, calling himself Simon, detonates a bomb at the crack of dawn on the first day of school, then calls the NYPD to announce his presence, and ask for McClane personally. He's out for revenge for something McClane has done in his past, and threatening to blow up random locations in New York City unless McClane cooperates and does everything Simon tells him to do.In the first two films, McClane begins the film dressed well, and ends up in tatters. Here, we are introduced to McClane already a mess, a half-employed cop in a vest/ undershirt, what appears to be three or so days of beard stubble, an alcoholic nursing a hangover. Filmmakers this time basically cut to the chase, and show us McClane in tatters in the first scene.Now 40 years old McClane is not the reluctant hero this time, here he has been (successfully, I think) turned into an antihero. Zeus comes into things early on, his character has nothing to do with the story, he's just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and Simon says that he has to play along with the game- and in the end, Zeus does more to stop the villain than McClane does. Zeus figures out some of Simon's games long before McClane does, like Simon's telephone number and the bit with the 42nd president, and getting to the payphone at Wall Street. Zues is the reluctant hero this time, McClane is really an antihero this time, both caught in Simon's elaborate game of revenge. The two men spend the rest of the day careering around Manhattan, trying to accomplish the progressively more and more inane tasks set for them, in retaliation against McClane, for something he has done in the past, while the NYPD and FBI are largely helpless to stop him.There's a lot of action here, a lot of great one liners, and a few clever, well written references to the first film without ripping off the original Die Hard. My personal favourite sequence was the elevator sequence, it had the same claustrophobic feeling of the first movie. It was just as well photographed as the original movie, the camera slowly zooms in on McClane's eyes (an effect completely lost in the pan-and-scan version) as he sees the fake cop's badge and he realises that he's in a crowded elevator surrounded by terrorist thugs. He distracts them by asking what the lotto numbers were, while at the same time sizing up the terrorists and where they're standing behind him, before opening fire on them, culminating with a clever and well done standoff between McClane and Otto. The musical score was convincing and memorable, also the full, rich, vivid colours, and was violent without being too over the top, and it was short- less than 60 seconds. Short but memorable.The film loses momentum in the final third, and a couple of the action scenes lack logic- I've always wondered how anyone stops the water at the aquaduct after the bomb has been detonated, and how McClane and Zeus survive a thirty foot drop onto the deck of the cargo ship, much less the explosion on the ship later on, and the contrived happy ending- making this film the weakest of the trilogy, effective in the smaller scale sequences but faltering in the larger scale action scenes, but still a damn good movie, better than can be expected.I prefer the original ending to the one we saw in the original theatrical release, with McClane's shaky mental condition at the start of the film, added to by the events of that horrible day ultimately pushing him over the edge, he tracks down Simon to East Germany for his own game of revenge, as McClane fully becomes the antihero, with Simon almost becoming an anti-villain. The ending that we see now is a rather anticlimactic, badly edited, and contrived ""happy ending"", which looks as though it were written and filmed rather quickly.Avoid the awful pan-and-scan version shown on television and only watch the widescreen version.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
89,philip_vanderveken,This only works very well thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's and Bruce Willis' performances,7,6 April 2005,"I guess the ""Die Hard"" movies wouldn't have been the same without Bruce Willis as John McClane and Willis would probably never have been as known as he is today if it hadn't been for these movies. Sure, he has made many more movies, but I guess that, if you ask many people to name one movie with Bruce Willis in it, most of the time it will be one of the Die Hard movies which people will remember.McClane's life is a complete mess: he's about to divorce, he has been suspended and he drinks more alcohol than can possibly be good for him. But than a massive bomb explodes in the Bonwit Teller department store. Of course this causes a lot of commotion and the police is anxious to find out who did it, when they get a phone call from a guy with a German accent who calls himself ""Simon"". Simon wants McClane to go to the corner of 138th Street and Amsterdam in Harlem and wear a racist sign. Of course this will mean instant death, but why does Simon want to have him killed? The answer is simple, because he's the brother of Hans Gruber, the terrorist he threw off a building a few years back. Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), a local shop owner, saves McClane and together they find themselves in a deadly game of ""Simon Says"" while McClane isn't in the mood for games because he has a bad temper and an awful hangover...Normally I'm not a big fan of all those buddy/cop movies, but this movie is an exception. The interaction between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson is of an outstanding quality. These two even made me forget about the, let's be honest, a bit silly story. The entire movie would have failed if it hadn't been for these two. I haven't had such a good time with this kind of movie since 'Lethal Weapon' (probably the best movie to compare it with) and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
90,moviewizguy,Think fast. Look alive. Die hard.,6,21 April 2008,"John McClane is back and is facing one of his greatest challenges yet. It's New York City and an individual, known only as 'Simon'. He has planted explosive devices in different locations of the city, and the only way for McClane to stop them is to follow what Simon says. Dragging Zeus into the problem, McClane must solve every riddle that Simon gives and get to each bomb before it goes off.Bruce Willis looks tired. Really tired. I am tired. Really tired. Seeing how this is the fourth Die Hard film I've seen and this is the third Die Hard film in the franchise, I'm not surprised I got this reaction. Everything is just too tiring to watch and enjoy anymore. To top it off, this movie takes entirely too long to set up everything and entirely too long itself. If the movie was fast paced and cut about 40 minutes out, I'm sure it would've worked.Anyway, I was looking forward to this movie. I was disappointed. I don't know. I just expected much more and some ingenious ideas floating around. There is maybe one idea that I remember that was smart and neat but other than that, nada. No, this is on a much larger scale than the first two, yes, but everything gets old and boring and uninteresting after 40 minutes and the climax is just unnecessarily long too.Bruce Willis' performance the third time around seems too tiring. He doesn't look interested in his character anymore. The one liners aren't as fun to hear as the other three movies and that one liner seemed out of place, as if placed in there because the previous two movies had that line. Jeremy Irons performance was decent, I guess, but not anything special though and Samuel L. Jackson's performance was pretty good.In the end, the movie was a big let down and a huge disappointment. I found Die Hard a decent action movie, Die Hard 2 really entertaining, and Live Free or Die Hard the most fun I've had in the cinema! This one just seems dead and out there for no other reason then to just make another movie for the fun of it. I wasn't having fun. Instead, I was yearning this film to finish. Oh, well.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
91,Gislef,Irons + Jackson don't equal Good Sequel,7,18 December 1998,"Only the presence of those two actors save DH 3 from being a rehash of the previous two movies.  Yes, in a way it's a direct sequel to the first movie (rather than the remake that was DH2).  But it's basically the same ""things are not what they seem"" scam of the first two movies:  the vengeance subplot is a triviality at best and probably the most entertaining part of the movie.  Willis' character does need an active partner, and Jackson fills the role admirably, but he's about the only saving grace.  That, and Irons' twist on the ""you killed my brother"" revenge plot.  It's entertaining, but I'm not sure there's anything that really could have saved it without a total rewrite and going into new territory story-wise.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
92,mjw2305,"Wow, it's better than the original",9,31 December 2006,"In the third outing for John Mclane (Bruce Willis), he is being used as a puppet by a very sinister and vengeful criminal genius who calls himself Simon (Jeremy Irons) When Mclane is just seconds away from being killed on the streets of Harlem, a local shop owner called Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) intervenes and is then forced to join the game.The pairing of Willis and Jackson is throughly entertaining and it is in this concept that this film surpasses its predecessors, Die Hard with a Vengeance is a high paced, action packed buddy cop movie that simply outclasses most that came before it! Yes it's up there with Lethal Weapon; Mclane and Zeus are every bit as good as Riggs and Murtaugh.Beneath the against the clock action sequences and the laugh out loud comedy from the duo, lies a very believable villain with bags of character and a very sinister desire to both succeed in his plans and reap vengeance on Mclane in the process, for reasons that do become apparent.Die Hard with a Vengeance is an action movie, a comedy, a thriller and an adventure all packaged as one film; it entertains on every level and is definitely one of the best movies of its kind ever made.Excellent cast, excellent plot, excellent gags, excellent direction, excellent script, excellent movie. 9/10 Don't miss this one",Die Hard with a Vengeance
93,sme_no_densetsu,"Departs from the ""Die Hard"" formula but not altogether unsuccessfully",7,11 February 2018,"The ""Die Hard"" series is one of the most popular in the action movie genre over the last 30 years. 1995's ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is the middle entry out of five movies to date. The first movie set the template and the second didn't stray far from the original premise but I guess they felt that they had to change things up for the third entry.This time around, NYPD detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is once again the focal character but he's joined by Samuel L. Jackson as another guy who's basically in the wrong place at the wrong time. As a result, rather than McClane being more or less on his own like we're used to, the movie feels more like a buddy cop movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, and there are certainly a lot worse buddies you could have than Samuel L. Jackson. However, in my mind, this departure makes the movie seem a little less like a ""Die Hard"" movie.Despite this change, the movie still calls back to the original by featuring a storyline that pits McClane against Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), the brother of original villain Hans Gruber. Past Oscar-winner Irons makes a memorable villain in his own right but he'd be hard-pressed to top Alan Rickman's iconic performance. In fact, both Irons & Jackson prove to be excellent additions to the cast but, that being said, I did find it a bit disappointing that Willis was the only returnee from the first two movies. Again, this is something that I felt made this movie seem less like a continuation of ""Die Hard"" and more like something else entirely that someone went out of their way to fashion into a ""Die Hard"" movie.Perhaps I'm being unduly harsh on the moviemakers for trying something a bit different here. Taken on it's own merits, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is a perfectly serviceable action movie, above average even. My only real complaints with the plot are that the villain's scheme is preposterously intricate and the final showdown is over the top. These don't ruin a movie that is essentially well made overall. Of course, when you're dealing with a sequel it's only natural to compare with the original and that comparison is rarely ever favorable for the sequel. Altogether, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is a pretty good action movie and if it isn't as good as what came before it, it's at least better than what came after.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
94,Analog_Devotee,7/10,7,5 July 2021,"Definitely a fantastic entry into the franchise. Feels like the smarter one in the group. Not as good as the original and the first sequel, in my opinion, but I can totally see how this could be a favorite for some.Samuel L. Jackson was a genius addition to make for a buddy-action feel. How the heck did Sam even find time to sleep during the 90s? Dude's schedule must have been insane.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
95,Screen_Blitz,Entertaining third installment of the beloved action franchise,7,5 January 2016,"John McTiernan has returned for a third time, and so Bruce Willis making his appearance as the beloved action hero John McClane. This time around, John McClane has become a heavy alcoholic, to the point where he is not only separated from his wife Holly but has also been suspended from the New York Police Department. After making an a rather awkward encounter with a Harlem pawn shop owner Zeus Carver (played by Samuel L. Jackson), the two witness a bomb go off in a department store nearby. The criminal mastermind behind the explosion is no one other than German terrorist Simon Gruber (played by Jeremy Irons) who gives McClane a call and pulls him a deadly game of ""Simon Says"", where he must perform a series of tasks around the city. Each time he fails to comply, another bomb will detonate. Assisted by the reluctant Zeus Carver, McClane must finish Simon's devious tasks one by one to save the city and stop him and his crew from robbing the Federal Reserve Building. I have watched Die Hard and Die Hard 2 plenty of times, and are they're both pretty fun action movies. The first one left a cinematic landmark on the action genre, and was a career-defining film for Bruce Willis. The second one is quite entertaining, though didn't quite make an everlasting impression like the predecessor. This one continues the franchise with more fun and edge-of-your-seat action, with Samuel L. Jackson making a surprising appearance as the supporting hero who helps John McClane on his mission to thwart Simon Gruber's twisted plan. Jackson is certainly not an actor I expected to see star opposite Bruce Willis in the franchise. Nonetheless, he does a fine job as his character, even when he gets annoying with his racial one-liners. Bruce Willis remains good as ever as the main character, showing a charismatic performance that brought to the previous two films. Willis and Jackson both work shockingly well together, and based on their performances; you can tell that these two star studs are having a blast. Jeremy Irons also brings solid appeal to his role as the main villain, though he doesn't quite bring the same charisma as what Alan Rickman delivered in the first film. I have to admit though, he does come pretty close.What is a Die Hard movie without some spectacular action sequences and a solid plot? A bad one, that's for sure. This film is filled with some exciting action scenes, complete with some tense gunfights off and on, an intense subway crash, and of course, some explosions done by the antagonist Simon Gruber. The plot on the other hand, is the biggest gem of the film. Based on the decent screenplay, the film follows a plot of the villain's plan to commit robbery, much like the previous films which also deal with robbery to acquire large sums of money, but never gets old nonetheless. The plot is full of surprises and suspense, and is solidly paced to grab viewer's attention and never let go. There is never a dull moment throughout the 131-minute runtime. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a decent continuation to John McTiernan's action franchise, and proves that Bruce Willis is still committed to his character John McClane. It is rare for a film series to age well after its third installment, but this manages to show that the third film is not always the end of the line for a great franchise.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
96,BrandtSponseller,McTiernan strikes gold (again),10,19 May 2005,"Series note: Although the Die Hard films obviously follow one another chronologically in the film's universe, they are not really constructed as chapters in a novel. You could watch them in any order, but to give the characters more depth, and make better sense of a couple minor references, I would still recommend watching them in order.In my Die Hard 2 (1990) review, I complained (although apologetically) a bit about the lapses in internal logic. It ended up being somewhat excusable, because I read Die Hard 2 as a satire of the genre as much as a serious action film. With Die Hard 3, John McTiernan is back at the helm, as he was for Die Hard (1988), and the result is once again a more serious action film (containing some comic relief, of course) with very taut internal logic. In fact, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is so well constructed, so well acted and so well directed that I like it just as much, if not better, than Die Hard.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is once again separated from his wife, and he's once again living and working as a cop in New York City. As the film begins, he is on a temporary suspension for some never-specified infraction (it works better that it isn't specified, as it enables us to imagine all kinds of crazy things that this gruff character might have done). After a bomb explodes at the Bonwit Teller department store, a mysterious person calling himself ""Simon"" calls the police taking credit and asking to speak with McClane--or he'll detonate further bombs in crowded areas. They rouse McClane from the aftermath of a drunken stupor. He shows up at the police station with a hangover, looking haggard. ""Simon"" is fond of riddles and makes McClane engage in a bizarre game of ""Simon Says"". The first task is for McClane to head up to Harlem and stand on a street corner in his skivvies wearing a sandwich board that says only, ""I Hate Blacks"" (using a more inflammatory epithet than ""blacks""). Of course, he almost gets killed, but at the last minute, a reluctant savior in the form of a local shopkeeper, Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), helps save his butt. Unwittingly, Carver ends up embroiled in the Simon Says games with McClane, with increasingly serious stakes. Just who is Simon? Why is he toying with McClane? I should note that I was predisposed to like this film. I like Bruce Willis a lot, but I especially love Samuel L. Jackson. The combination of the two here is simply magical. They have remarkable chemistry and the characters that scriptwriter Jonathan Hensleigh has drawn enable both deep tension and hilarious comic moments between the two.But the film succeeds on more than the charisma of its two principal actors. Die Hard: With a Vengeance has a fantastic, intelligent plot. Hensleigh ties his villain to the story of the first film in a semi-satirical way that gives the motivation for the ""Simon Says"" games great depth. The Simon Says games manage to be silly, smart, humorous and great catalysts for dramatic tension at the same time. There are subtle jokes about New York City, New York City cops, ""reverse racism"", European opinions of American intelligence, and so on. And of course, there are many edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting action sequences involving a wide variety of environments in the New York City area. The wide variety of environments was a nice change over the more limited settings of the previous two films, and gives Die Hard: With a Vengeance a feel almost like an adventure film.It's remarkable that Hensleigh and McTiernan were able to sustain such a high level of excellence throughout. If you look at Die Hard: With a Vengeance from a broader perspective, the whole is constructed something like one of Simon's puzzles. Every scene leads inevitably, logically to the next scene, even though the film takes many ""left turns"", and the solution of one dilemma to the next often involves split-second timing.It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost ""goofy"" humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane ""riding"" something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.As for subtexts, they are similar to those of the first Die Hard, with some interesting additions. There is an intriguing parallel between McClane's disheveled state, the typical New York City chaos, and the attempts to further undermine stability from the villain. Focusing on this aspect, Carver provides more of a dependable, even-keeled balance.There are also direct references to very contemporary political subtexts--with foreigners having in mind that the U.S. has socio-economic power disproportionately in its favor. They claim to want to redress the imbalance, although in this film, at least, the claim may end up being a false representation--there appears to be corruption undermining it. However, it's interesting that there is yet another ""twist"" towards the end that shows the claim may not have been as corrupt as we initially believed, even if it still seems a bit mad and/or megalomaniacal. It's also interesting that the resolution is reached on foreign ground.But the subtexts in Die Hard: With a Vengeance may be even more minor focuses than in the previous two films. Instead the focus is on the spectacle of a tightly told, thrilling action/adventure story. That's all the film needs to succeed as well as it does.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

I liked every film in the series and Die Hard with a vengeance isn't in the curse of the trilogy. It's tied with Die Hard 2. I think that Die Hard with a vengeance doesn't really seem like a die Hard film, but it's more of one than the last film. There is yet another cat and mouse game going on the third time around. There is in every one, but the last film didn't really seem like it. I really did like Die hard with a vengeance because it's a revenge story. That's not why I really liked it though. I didn't really like it quite as much as the original, but it's still a fantastic film. It's a great third part to a series. There are many good performances in the film. Of course by Bruce Willis. Also by Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson, no surprise there also. Die hard with a vengeance is sort of like a heist film. It really is a cat and mouse film though. The entire film Mclane(Bruce Willis) is chasing after Simon Gruber(Jeremy Irons) because Simon keeps giving out all of these threats.

100,vip_ebriega,Sweet 'Vengeance'.,7,13 October 2007,"My Take: Not as good and thrilling as the first, but has all the right ingredients to make it an explosive adventure. Sequels like DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE don't come much around anymore. It's not as good as the ones that preceded it, but it doesn't care about that, all it wants is to be a great, stand-alone action thriller that does what it is intended to do. Granted, it's not as great as the original, or as wildly exciting as the second, but in its own stand-alone way, it delivers thrill after thrill, then, when the explosions calm down, it delivers suspense after suspense. It's like a bomb, when it explodes, it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, when it's not, it's still edgy waiting for it to happen. Since it's a DIE HARD picture, you know there will be an explosion, but it's hidden with a great amount of suspense, you hardly notice how predictable it might have been.Once again, Bruce Willis is back as John McLane, he's divorced and on vacation from his police work in New York. He is, though, called in back when a mad-bombing terrorist has frequently blown-up a couple of New York department stores. McLane, joined by a racist partner, a store clerk, named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), they get frequent pay phone calls from a guy named Simon (Jeremy Irons), the terrorist, who has placed bombs after bombs in New York city's train subways, trash cans and many other places, which he uses to play cat-and-mouse with McLane.This leads to a numerous amount of action sequences that are almost twice as exciting as the ones in the previous films. We have a mad dash in Central Park, a race thru a flooding sewer line, a chase/shootout st the streets and a lot of other actions and explosions to keep you busy.Like the first film, DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is directed by John McTiernan, who, once again, give us an endless supply of action and thrills, and a good dose of comedy and characters as well. Willis' and Jackson's characters never get boring or thin, and Irons' villainous performance makes him the best of the DIE HARD villains in my book. What McTiernan does lack in this chapter is the appeal of its other central character, John's wife Holly McLane, who is completely absent in this film, thus betraying much of the chemistry that they had which actually worked. DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is not the best of the series and really doesn't catch up with its predecessors, but it's a great entertainment nonetheless and is, in fact, on a league of its own.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
101,fmarkland32,Like a dead battery...,5,28 June 2007,"John McTiernan and Bruce Willis return for Die Hard With A Vengeance and frankly one is ultimately disappointed with what the final result was. The movie this time finds John McClane(Bruce Willis) and a shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) both joining forces to fight off Simon (Jeremy Irons) the brother of Hans, the villain of part 1. The action this time finds Willis and Jackson driving around the city and looking and answering phones and what not, before coming up with a game-plan that saves the day. Die Hard 2 wasn't very believable but by comparison to # 3 it's the most realistic movie ever made. The problem is just how long the movie is, it follows the same repetitive path and the story lacks any form of plot. Worst of all is just how uninspired it all feels, it's as if McTiernan didn't know what to do with the story and so he just turns it into a long action sequence.

This time, there is a mad bomber on the other end of the telephone telling McClane riddles, and these little puzzles make the film intriguing and very intense as the stakes are raised with every puzzle, and include very dramatic national panics. There is a lack of realism, but the fast flowing nature will keep you hooked.However this time there is less claustrophobia as McClane travels all over New York to solve the many puzzles. Though I loved the claustrophobic surroundings in the first two films, spreading his wings was necessary for McClane to be seen as a more wild and courageous man with more to do with himself, such as driving a taxi across a national park and searching for a bomb on a train, which were pure adrenaline rushes.Jeremy Irons (Reversal of Fortune) is excellent as Simon and raised the bar for Jackson and Willis.McTiernan returns to direct and uses his knowledge to great effect with the action sequences all perfectly shot to create the right dramatic effect.The third Die Hard is fast, exciting and beautifully executed by cast and crew to make a memorable action thriller.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

And there just as mean and twice as ugly!,8,29 July 2000,"This film stays true to Hollywood's favourite villains, the GERMANS, there are no people who are so often cast as villains (I wonder why) and only the Russians get close. But they tend to do a good job, so why not use them. Or as they did here, hire an American or Englishman (just as they did in the 1st one) and let him pretend to be a German. OK his German isn't that good (his brother Hans' was a tag worse so here is an improvement). But at least some of the henchmen are real German's so there is a bit of good German spoken in the film.
I found it really great that the original cast / crew was assembled here Bruce Willis of course and also John McTiernan, who is a great director. The cast was greatly enriched with the great Samuel L.Jackson (who is one of the best and most successful supporting actors of OUR time). The bad guy was good too, you know, playing games, making riddles and riddles hard to solve when the clock is ticking and he wasn't too stupid either, he would have succeeded if he hadn't made one little mistake in the end, but hey, how should he know McClane would escape. It was really impossible from the villains point of view!!! 
But to cut the yip yap on to the film, it is great, it has got some great action sequences, great acting (for an action flick), good direction and of course enough profanity and dumb comments to make you laugh you fu..ing a.. off. I mean I've seen it 6 or 7 times since 1997 (that's 7 TIMES in THREE YEARS) and I still love it, the only pity is that it is cut to 123 minutes (I need to see the uncut version!!!!) and there was quite a lot of cutting in the version I saw. It appeared to me that there were cut's during the cutting up the guard scene (not sure about that one though), the elevator scene, during the falling on the boat and disposing scene and last, but not least in the fight with Targo scene. 
Now for a bit of SPOILER stuff I guess about solving the 3 and 5 gallon bottle mystery (hell I just figured it out during the 7th time I saw this one. Ain't I STUPID???). Well this is for the folks that don't get it either:
You fill the 5 gallon totally up, then you put 3 of those 5 gallons in the 3 gallon bottle. After that you empty the 3 gallon bottle and our the 2 gallon from the 5 gallon bottle in the three gallon bottle (STATUS: 5 gallon bottle = 0 gallons and 3 gallon bottle = 2 gallons). After that you fill the 5 gallon bottle up and then you fill the missing gallon in the 3 gallon bottle with the water from the filled up 5 gallon bottle. That leaves you exactly 4 gallon in the 5 gallon bottle!!!

It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is so good as the first one, I couldn't decide which one I love to Death: Die Hard or Die Hard With a Vengeance. I love this movie to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in Die Hard series and action films. I love the original Die Hard to death but I love this sequel much more. That's my personal opinion. This franchise effort is a gleeful no-brainer with nonstop action. Die Hard With A Vengeance I really do believe is the greatest action sequel and a true masterpiece to the first movie. It gives some additional action pleasure, as we get to watch action heroes Bruce Willis get smacked around for 128 minutes. In this third outing with John McClane, we are faced with yet another mad bomber on the loose. Jeremy Irons plays Simon, an East German Special Forces Colonel-turned-terrorist mastermind and the older brother of Hans Gruber, who has a score to settle with Detective McClane. Simon's bombing game comes complete with crafty riddles, which must be solved in a specified time or everything goes boom. McClane has no choice but to play. Along the way, he picks up an unlikely accomplice named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper. Together they tear all over New York trying to head off disaster. Sure, it's all perfectly preposterous, but DIE HARD 3 has been directed with breathless intensity by John McTiernan, who certainly has a way with wrecking things. Was he very destructive as a child? Loved the spectacular subway crash, John. That hair-raising taxi ride through Central Park wasn't bad, either. I love the fact that they are saving kids from school. Charlie try's to disabled the bomb in school while Kowalski and Lambert are saving those kids stuck in the building I love that scene. McClane and Carver are desperately searching for the code for the bomb to disabled it, I love it to death. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts for this ride. It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost ""goofy"" humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane ""riding"" something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action film and the third in the Die Hard film series. It was produced and directed by John McTiernan (who directed Die Hard), written by Jonathan Hensleigh, and stars Bruce Willis as New York City Police Department Lieutenant John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, and Jeremy Irons as Simon Peter Gruber. Twenty years ago, after two blockbuster movies and a five-year wait, the ""Die Hard"" franchise roared back into theaters with the explosive ""Die Hard with a Vengeance."" The movie was released on May 19, 1995, and it was an instant classic, thanks to a smart script, exciting plot, and the absolutely stellar chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. But not only was ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" a great movie, it was also arguably the best of its kind: unstoppable, and untoppable.Die Hard With A Vengeance was filmed before CGI made it possible to create scenes like this without breaking a single window, this moment is utter, terrifying perfection.How often do you get an action flick where the heroes spend the entire first half of the film solving puzzles to save lives? In a franchise that distinguishes itself with action that toes the line between ""creative"" and ""ridiculous,"" ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" stays on brand, in the best way.John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. 10/10 Score: bad Ass Seal Of Approval my personal second favorite Die Hard action movie.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
106,fernandoschiavi,"A good action film, but his scenes with less impact and his narrative less engaging than in previous films make this the least interesting film in the series so far",7,6 September 2020,"After not directing the second film in the series to get involved in another project, John McTiernan is back in the director's chair. The script, this time, is written by Jonathan Hensleigh. Originally titled Simon Says, it was being polished to a possible Lethal Weapon4 - which ended up only being released in 1998. With a less inspired narrative, the feature is based on the charisma of its protagonist and the good action sequences. In addition, he manages to talk well with the first film in the series, when John McClane was a fallible figure, Die Hard 3 shows a policeman at the bottom of the shaft, managing to expand the character's arc beyond pure and simple action.Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) has been separated from his wife for a year, has been drinking too much and is also away from the police. In addition to these problems, the brother (Jeremy Irons) of an old enemy begins to place bombs in busy places in New York and gives the police a series of puzzles that can prevent explosions. In an attempt to resolve them, he accidentally begins to be helped by Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), a man from Harlem, who helps him to unravel the whole plot.Although Die Hard (1988) is considered the best film in the series, Die Hard 3: Vengeance is the one with the most action scenes and the busiest script. Just remember that the first issue of the series takes at least twenty minutes to make it clear what the threat will be and who will save the day. This third copy, in turn, already has an explosion in New York in its first 30 seconds, triggering an action movie full of twists and turns and cat and mouse games. And who better to solve the case than John McClane? This time, the hero is in his natural habitat, but he is a real rag. Separated from his wife and removed from the police, McClane is called back thanks to the terrorist Simon (Jeremy Irons, best villain in the saga) who demands that the policeman follow a script he devised, uncovering clues and even defusing bombs along the way.Hensleigh's script deals with situations different from those previously seen. Now, in addition to the story not taking place at Christmas, this time the script uses New York City to develop instead of being stuck in a building or airport. We also have a direct link to the first film in the series. The opening scene sets the tone of the production, showing the chaotic New York City to the sound of Summer In The City (John Benson Sebastian, Steve Boone, Mark Sebastian), with its long, busy streets, until a big explosion that interrupts the scenes panoramic. In a short time, it is understood that, this time, John McClane is not the unlucky victim of the events, but who was called to come to action by a terrorist who threatened to destroy the city if the police did not appear.The game of riddles imposed by the villain, although it seems somewhat unlikely, ends up keeping the viewer interested all the time, wanting to know the next clue, thinking along with the character. Another point to highlight is the fact that McClane is loose in the city. Unlike the previous ones, when he was confined to a building or airport, the policeman can run through the streets of the Big Apple, which makes for exciting action scenes, like the crazy taxi ride through New York, the shootings on Wall Street and the trips to heroes on a villain-infested freighter. The public, in general, is fully involved in the game of Simon, who in fact does not want to take revenge, but to involve the police in an ingenious game of credulity and, with that, to hide his true objective: a billionaire bank robbery.The script gets it right by abusing the ""clue and reward"" device, for example, through the badge ""6991"", the name of the school where a bomb is and the aspirin that delivers the villain's whereabouts in the third act. On the other hand, the narrative fails due to the excess of implausible moments, like the one when McClane is expelled from a tunnel full of water just as Zeus was passing through the street, in an unimaginable coincidence in a huge city like New York. This kind of artifice also exists in previous films, it is true, but it is softened by more immersive narratives and more impressive action scenes, something that unfortunately does not happen in this ""Die Hard - Vengeance"", which ends up highlighting the exaggerations of the script precisely because of the lack of remarkable moments and memorable scenes. But if this fails, Hensleigh redeems himself by creating an interesting code of ethics in the villains, who fight not to leave bombs in the reach of children and let Zeus leave at a certain moment, which makes them less one-dimensional and, consequently, more interesting.
The film reverses the logic seen previously to present a new breath for the story and introduces a dangerous element that is usually established at the end of a trilogy: the adhesion of a partner to the central character. Placed at random next to each other, the partnership between Zeus Carver and McClane, with an always angry and good Samuel L. Jackson, approaches another famous duo in the style: Riggs and Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon. While the Murtaugh / Riggs duo was about the experienced and sensible cop and the fearless newcomer, Jackson's Zeus represents the common, civil, thoughtful and responsible man who opposes the explosive McClane. The dynamics between the characters expands the consecrated irony of the central character, which makes this film the funniest of the three. Evidently, there is no longer any intention of producing a credible story - or character. It is also notable that the script balances well between McClane, his assistant, Zeus, and the thug who, as the title implies, somehow wants to take revenge. The bond with the first story is not made as exaggerated as we see in contemporary films, looking like a natural sequence of previous events.Jeremy Irons gives life to Simon Gruber, brother of Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in the original film) and it is on his own that the subtitle ""Revenge"" exists. Simon is determined to avenge the death of his brother, who ended up discovering in the worst possible way that he has no wings or is able to glide. Simon is a good villain. And, even though the script throws logic out the window, it has all the elements to hold the audience's attention. This, however, does not happen entirely. In part, because the viewer is subjected to the usual arsenal of so-called action films: explosions, flying cars, piles of shots, pursuits, etc. These are the conventions of their kind, and they must be satisfied.Even with more than two hours in duration, ""Die Hard - With a Vengeance"" never gets boring, thanks to the good pace printed by the editing of John Wright and the direct driving of McTiernan. With dynamic and well-conducted scenes, such as the sequence in which McClane and Zeus cross the city in a taxi (and the opposite way!) Or the sequence inside the subway, the film presents an agile rhythm, which holds our attention. On the other hand, the director is unable to transform these scenes into moments of strong impact, which is a considerable flaw in an action film. Note, for example, one of the rare moments when McTiernan manages to create tension, when the phone rings while a clearly terrified policeman points a gun at Zeus, who needs to answer the phone call and prevent a bomb from exploding on the subway.Peter Menzies Jr.'s photography only bets on the night and the darkness in the final act, in a late attempt to increase tension. Michael Kamen's soundtrack, on the other hand, follows the action movie playbook with its fast and loud chords, showing originality only in reference to the classic ""Dr. Fantastic"" every time the Germans come alone - especially Gruber's wife. Even though the story is set in a time when there were some experiments in visual effects - which were crawling - with a poorly composed result between image and computerized backgrounds, the action is uninterrupted and turns this small defect into almost nothing. If in other situations McClane tries, in his own way, to beat the rules said by the bandit, here he spends most of his time as a plaything and, little by little, he realizes the imposed distractions and the true intentions of the villain, who tries to dominate the situation.One of the successes of the series ""Die Hard"" is in the constant feeling that we have that McClane will not succeed in his endeavor. We fear for his destiny, precisely because he looks like someone real and vulnerable, and not an invincible hero. In this third film this feeling is even stronger, especially after the sequel on the ship. Unfortunately, the script bets on the traditional formula and one last clue leads us to the traditional confrontation between villain and good guy, with McClane's more than expected victory. Despite the conventional ending and the clichés of the genre, ""Die Hard - With a Vengeance"" is a good action film, which is based mainly on the chemistry between Willis and Jackson and the charisma of its protagonist. On the other hand, his scenes with less impact and his narrative less engaging than in previous films make this the least interesting film in the series so far.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

In the end, the audience gets a casserole of film elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies.

113,anselmdaniel,Comedic action,7,17 April 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Die Hard with a Vengeance is an action thriller that premiered in 1995. The movie is the third installment in the Die Hard franchise and follows Die Hard 2 that premiered in 1990. The third Die Hard has Simon Gruber exacting a revenge on John McClane for his actions in Die Hard.Die Hard with a Vengeance is a surprisingly funny movie. This movie is more of a buddy cop movie than the previous installments. Samuel L. Jackson plays Zeus Carver who assists John McClane as he enters into doing deals with Simon to stop a terrorist attack. These two characters have excellent chemistry as the movie develops. It was hilarious watching Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson immerse themselves into their characters and bounce jokes off one another.The action scenes are exciting but the movie takes more of a focus as a thriller. Simon Gruber is a slippery villain much like Hans Gruber. He is played well by Jeremy Irons but Simon feels like Hans does. There is not much creativity with this villain. It felt like the movie wanted to make Simon more of an exaggerated form of Hans' griminess. Instead this lead to Simon seeming more of an imitation of Hans. The movie did feel like it tried to be smarter than the original 1988 Die Hard with Simon's plans. However this lead to the movie feeling more convoluted than it should have been.I would recommend ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"".Grade: C.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

115,ctomvelu-1,Action romp,7,1 February 2009,"John McTiernan returned for the third installment, Jon Hensleigh did a bang-up screenplay and Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson make a wonderfully hysterical odd couple in a movie that never stops to take a breath. Not once. The Germans are back, this time with a plan to steal gold from the Federal Reserve on New York. To accomplish this, they lead McClane and the NYPD on a merry chase around Manhattan as various things are blown up, including a subway car (created using a spectacular physical special effect, much studied over the years and later turned into a ""ride"" at Universal Studios). McClane and his newfound buddy, a Harlem store owner not fond of whites, survive innumerable obstacles to finally track down the bad guys, led by the brother of the main bad guy McClane killed in DIE HARD. Jeremy Irons goes slumming as the baddie here. The movie is full of impossible heroics, but who cares? Wisely, Hensleigh and McTiernan chose to treat the god-awful DIE HARD 2 as if it never existed and directly linked DH3 to DH. The one false note is the total absence of Mrs. McClane. Bonnie Bedelia at the very least deserved a cameo. There are several shots of the World Trade Ceter towers, which hurts the heart today. Otherwise, McTiernan makes great use of NYC locations, including an eye-popping, heart-stopping, running gun battle along the Saw Mill Parkway. And there's just enough humor to keep things from getting too grim and completely out of hand. Watching Bruce Willis get knocked around by a flood in a water tunnel is the film's highlight. By the by, I have often wondered if the German language version of the movie turned the bad guys into Frenchies or Brits.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

117,Min111,Die Hard 3,9,23 July 2017,"This was a fitting end to a trilogy. There was no need for a ""fourth"" and ""fifth"" movies. I wish those movies never happened. ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is a unique film just like its previous editions. Die Hard was based inside a tall building; Die Hard 2 was based inside an airport; and Die Hard 3 was based within an entire city (New York). In the third movie, I like how the setting takes place inside or within a city. It's different compared to the previous two movies, and it means the movie is watchable. I thought it was a great idea to have the setting based in New York: the city is huge. It worked. I also like the villain. His name is ""Simon Gruber"" who is the brother of ""Hans Gruber"", so this movie has ties to the first one, so it makes it more interesting to follow. He's German. He's a psychopath. He's a terrorist. There's some unfinished business for Simon Gruber. He wants revenge or vengeance for the death of his brother. Simon is just as dangerous as his brother. He's the sole reason why the third movie was enjoyable. I like the games he played with John McClane - it was seriously dangerous. I still think Simon's brother, Hans, was the better villain, but it's mighty close. The best part of the movie would have to be the reaction of John McClane where he finds out that Simon Gruber is the brother of Hans Gruber. That scene was epic! I liked John McClane reaction when he heard the news. He was shocked! There's debate whether ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is better than ""Die Hard 2"", and I'll find that hard to disagree with if that's the case. Personally, I think ""Die Hard 3"" is better, but the important thing is that all three of these Die Hard movies are good. In the previous Die Hard movies, Bruce on his own was hard enough, but in ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", despite having Samuel L. Jackson along with him on this adventure or journey, they were still no match for Simon Gruber for the most part. Just like in ""Die Hard"", I wanted the villain to win, but that's obviously not going to happen. I didn't care, and I didn't mind one bit. It's just one of these feelings I have for some reason. It's probably because I liked the villains so much. It was hard to resist. In ""Die Hard"", most of the action takes place during the night. In ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", the action takes place during the day. That's one of the major differences between the two movies. It's an action movie. It's an adventure movie. It's a thriller movie. That's three of the most popular movie genres. The movie was exciting. Though ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was a very good movie, I still don't think it's better than the first movie (Die Hard) though it's very close. If ""Die Hard"" was a great Christmas movie, or a great movie for the winter season, then ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was a great action movie for the summer season; in other words, a summer blockbuster!!! It's rare to see a third movie within the trilogy being successful, and ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was most certainly one of them. It's great watching it for the first time. It's even more great when you watch it for the second and third time, respectively. It's better and important to see ""Die Hard"" before you see ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"". You can actually skip watching Die Hard 2.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

119,policy134,Really well constructed and great chemistry between the two leads,7,4 August 2008,"When I heard about Die Hard with a Vengeance coming out and heard that Samuel L. Jackson was gonna be in it, I was thrilled. I had just seen Pulp Fiction and the expectation to see two of the stars of that brilliant film interact was almost too good to be true.Jackson and Willis do not disappoint. Their verbal sparring is hilarious and the writer of the script made a wise decision on making Jackson the smarter character. The only scene that I thought was a bit of a letdown comes in the middle of the film where Willis and Jackson have an argument about racism. What is that? Are they trying to prove that all people are racists underneath it all or did the writer think it was funny? Either way, it's not funny and it doesn't prove a point.Never mind. Most of the rest of the movie is a joy, fast paced and entertainment in its highest form. Credit must also go to Jeremy Irons who made an interesting villain, although a bit cartoonish. The sex scene with him and the female villain, Sam Phillips is too ridiculous to be sexy. I suspect, it was thrown in because the director thought it was necessary to show a little skin. There isn't really a female character with a strong part, and we all know why Sam Phillips' character had to be silent. Even so, the sex scene offers nothing but a cheap laugh.The action scenes are pretty believable, except for a couple of scenes involving a truck in an aqueduct and the scene where the villains make their getaway. To have one scene after that was a bit redundant and made the film drag on a little long but I guess they had to make time for McClane say his famous catchphrase.Beware! If you saw the most recent Die Hard (Live Free and Die Hard), Die Hard with a Vengeance has much more hardcore violence, but the violence is so over the top and cartoony that you don't really think that it is that shocking if you have seen the other Die Hard movies.If they decide to make another Die Hard bring back the character of Zeus. I was a little disappointed that Samuel L. Jackson didn't at least have a cameo in the 4th movie. Maybe you can't use him in a movie rated PG-13.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

I found this to be the weakest movie in the series, but that doesn't make it a bad film. It's still a very good movie. I just like the first two films better. Bruce Willis returns for a third-go-around as John McClane, the tough cop who's always in trouble with something. In the first film he faced terrorists in a skyscraper in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve. In the second film he faced terrorists at an airport in snowy Washington D.C. approximately one year after his L.A. adventure. In the third film he's back in New York and back with the N.Y.P.D. Bombs have been setup all over the city by a German maniac named Simon. This bad guy (played by Jeremy Irons) just happens to be the brother of the lead terrorist from the original film, and tries to exact revenge against McClane by playing ""Simon Says"". Simon orders McClane, along with his new partner Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), to go to certain areas of the city where bombs have been placed, and it's their job to disarm the bombs or try to prevent utter disaster. I didn't find ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" quite as spectacularly exciting as the previous two movies, but there is plenty of action which makes in very entertaining nevertheless. One thing that worked so well in the first two installments was the sense of humor. There's alot more of that in ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" which makes it the funniest film in the ""Die Hard"" series. Willis is fine, but the real star here is Jackson, who's hilarious as Zeus. The heated exchanges between Willis and Jackson throughout are very funny. The action scenes are top-notch as you would expect. I would rank this as the best action movie series to date (yes, I like the ""Die Hard"" movies better than the ""Lethal Weapon"" pictures which are good too). If ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" was the final film in this series, at least the series went out a winner.*** (out of four)",Die Hard with a Vengeance

125,J_Batek_II,The Reason Hollywood Doesn't Allow Teenage Boys To Write Action Movies.,4,16 June 2019,"When I was young, I thought this was 'THE BEST' of the Die Hard series, the way every teenager wants to amplify the importance of everything in their own individual lives. It makes sense that I would have loved this film, because 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' (1995) is written as if a teenage boy supervised this project.The original 'Die Hard' (1988) was about a guy who had a bad day. He got trapped in a high-rise building that was taken over by terrorists. 90 minutes and 1 plot device - a hijacked building. This third installment of the series has so many terrible things happen to John McClain - any one of which should have put him in the hospital. The mugging in Harlem should have given him a concussion, the explosion in the subway should have killed him, surfing on a dump truck (that no one is driving) is impossible, the wave that rushed under him while he hung on a sewer grate should have dislocated several joints in his upper body (and probably drown him)...I'll fast-forward to the end - John survives more hardships, then uses a snub-nose .38 caliber pistol to shoot down a helicopter loaded with a light machine gun.There were some positives - I like the 'shoot first, hardcore' version of John McClain in this film. It's as if this guy has been through so much, that now he doesn't even bother to ask questions before shooting and killing people. In an over-the-top sequel like this, a little realism is nice touch. The New York City location filming was also cool, but not cool enough to make this a good movie. Jonathan Hensleigh wrote this nonsense, and I don't like one project on his IMDB writing resume. This is a cartoonish attempt at a Die Hard film, and although better than 'Die Hard 2 (1990), still has not lived up to the original classic.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

126,Offworld_Colony,"In the tradition of Die Hard exposition, With A Vengeance starts more or less with McClane...",9,12 February 2020,"...in the back of a van and while he gets over his hangover his cop buddies rattle off about five things that will come in to play later on. I don't know if that's genius or nonsense.
Equally baffling is the outlandish way that McClane and Sam Jackson's Zeus meet. Is it edgy and dangerous or is it in bad taste? Although most of the rest of the film plays with race politics in an interesting way (Zeus at the phone with the cop is a dicey moment given recent history) and its interesting pre-9-11 to see how brutal the train crash is.
Fortunately this is one of the only things in this movie that seems dated, just like the first Die Hard, McTiernan directs a clean, crisp, energetic and pacey intelligent action flick. It's got some nice musical theme incorporations, and it's got a very claustrophobic directing style that sometimes works, and a Lethal Weapon witty buddy repartee.
But the piece de resistance is Jeremy Irons' Gruber who is as silly as he is sadistic. He's a real genuine pleasure and him and the film is deeply sinister with real stakes even around the whole of New York.
I have to admit I see this film through rose tinted nostalgia glasses, but I do love this film, it's fun, competent and modern with enough red herrings to choke ten cats and a great Shane Black sensibility. I do think it still holds up, but what the hell do I know, even John McTiernan called the plot ""frail and outrageous. I hope people enjoy its ridiculousness."" I do Sir, I do.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
127,Angeneer,Not bad,6,30 October 2000,"The problem with Die Hard movies is that they take themselves too seriously. While they always try to create a complex plot, they always end up making it dumber than before. Other than that, this one is good action, probably the best of the triad. Of course remember to turn off your higher cerebral functions.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
128,chrisbrown6453,The best of the three!,8,21 May 2002,"Die Hard With A Vengence is a near-perfect summer movie. This franchise effort is a gleeful no-brainer with nonstop action. It gives some additional perverse pleasure, as we get to watch smartypants Bruce Willis get smacked around for 112 minutes. In this third outing with John McClane, we are faced with yet another mad bomber on the loose. Jeremy Irons plays Simon, a nasty piece of Eurotrash who has a score to settle with Detective McClane. Simon's bombing game comes complete with crafty riddles, which must be solved in a specified time or everything goes boom. McClane has no choice but to play. Along the way, he picks up an unlikely accomplice named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper. Together they tear all over New York trying to head off disaster. Sure, it's all perfectly preposterous, but DIE HARD 3 has been directed with breathless intensity by John McTiernan, who certainly has a way with wrecking things. Was he very destructive as a child? Loved the spectacular subway crash, John. That hair-raising taxi ride through Central Park wasn't bad, either. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts for this ride.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
129,bat-5,John McClane is back and NYC is blowing up!,8,9 July 2000,"Someone's got a thing for John McClane.  Bombs are going off around New York and if McClane doesn't do what Simon says, more things will go boom.  Along for the ride with the always watchable Bruce Willis is Samuel L. Jackson, a electronics store owner who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  These two are off all over Manhattan figuring out Simon's little riddles.  Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast as the intelligent Simon.  He's shrewd, charming and knows how to get a job done.  Back in the director's chair is John McTiernan, overseeing the mayhem.  The action sequences are bigger, louder and wilder than before.  Car chases, shoot outs, and a really neat sequence involving a ship, a bridge and a truck highlight this action lovers delight.  So, buckle up, turn up the sound and get ready for a hell of a ride. New York is about to go boom!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
130,bsinc,Great ending to a trilogy,7,16 February 2002,"This movie just keeps getting better and better every time I see it. Entertainment at its absolute best. Someone once said that the good guy is only as good as the villain is. In this case I could not agree more. Jeremy Irons delivers an excellent performance(was he always that buffed) and Willis and Jackson just made a compatible and believable duo. They managed to top their acting skills in the M. Night Shyamalan movie Unbreakable (10+/10). Funny, highly entertaining and the story is OK(the ending is a little disappointing). As far as action movie are concerned this one has it all(well, most of of it, anyway).        8/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
131,DavidSim240183,Better than Part 2. But a long way away from the heights of Part 1,8,11 January 2008,"Die Hard is the classic among which all other action films are measured against in my opinion. Such a smooth and exciting film. It flows style and finesse. And then in 1990 came the obligatory sequel. A substantial step down, notably because of Renny Harlin's presence in the director's chair, it took the flawless, tightly plotted original and turned it into an action-packed no-brainer.Die Hard: With a Vengeance has quite a lot to make up for. And judging from the talent that went into it, I had very high hopes for it. Not only does it bring back Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane, it partners him up with Samuel L Jackson. It has Jeremy Irons in the role of the villain. And sees the welcome return of Die Hard director John McTiernan.I was expecting great things. But unfortunately, I ended up being a bit disappointed. Its certainly nice to see McTiernan back, and wisely he's adjusted the plot so its not a straight out rehash of Pt 1. The mistake Pt 2 fell into. But somehow, it has more flaws than it should for a film with so many good things to recommend it.It begins with a cracker of an opening. New York is going about its business when suddenly an explosion rocks the streets of Manhattan. Thoughts of 9/11 immediately spring to mind. The film even includes shots of the World Trade Center in the background, making DHWAV a very eerie film at times.The bomber who claims responsibility has only just begun. And he has a request to make of the NYPD. Get John McClane on the case. They're going to play a game of Simon Says. Simon gives McClane hints about where other bombs are planted in the city. And if McClane doesn't figure out how to defuse them, or even find where they are...well you can guess the rest.A hungover McClane, separated from his beloved Holly (sadly Bonnie Bedelia couldn't make it), is on suspension. But he's back on active duty quicker than you can say Yippie-Kayee. Saddled with Zeus (Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper, the two must unravel Simon's riddles before the next bomb goes off. But things are not what they seem.The good news about Die Hard: With a Vengeance is that it is a better film than Pt 2. McTiernan keeps the action steady, Pulp Fiction stars Jackson and Willis are an inspired double-act, and Jeremy Irons clearly loves chewing on the scenery before he blows it up.But somehow I was left with a nagging feeling of disappointment. And I only realised why after seeing it for the second time. The film begins promisingly enough with Simon's little games. They're quite lively, with lots of witty banter between Jackson and Willis, and some of the finest action not seen since...well Die Hard actually!But when it gets to the halfway point, the film then heads off in another direction. It turns out Simon's little game of Find the Bomb is just to keep the NYPD distracted, while he gets what he really wants. A gold heist. While everybody is running around like headless chickens trying to find a bomb he's put in a school, Simon's looting every gold depository in town.When I first saw DHWAV, this new angle seemed novel and inventive. But gradually, it was a plot development that rang a bit hollow. Its almost like the film is trying to be a bit too clever for its own good. Some people may accept it. And others may not. I suppose the film just about gets away with it, but the effort to do so does show through.Nethertheless, this film is a considerable improvement over its predecessor. It never gets quite as mindless as Die Hard 2, but that's because John McTiernan is a much better director than Renny Harlin. And he brings his usual style and finesse to this film as well. The action scenes are just as exciting as you'd expect. But more importantly, McTiernan made the wise choice to emphasise on the buddy relationship between McClane and Zeus.The two of them have cracking chemistry. In fact if truth be told, the film sags whenever McClane and Zeus aren't around. The Die Hard series up to this point has always been a one man show. With the inclusion of Zeus, its become a buddy movie. It does tread over some of the usual racial jokes, but I always believed they're grudging respect for each other.As for Jeremy Irons, he does not too badly at all as Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, the villain of Die Hard, played by the magnificent Alan Rickman. Irons never quite leaves an indelible impression upon the film the way Rickman did, but at least he keeps himself in check. He never launches into the over the top theatrics that scuppered Dungeons & Dragons. His German accent is convincing enough. But his attempt at an American accent...well, the less said the better.As the film draws to a close, I did start to get a bit lost. I think McTiernan overdoes some of the action to the point of overkill. In fact McTiernan is guilty of some of the things he was parodying in his previous film, the very underrated Last Action Hero.Also it makes it that much harder to follow the film at that point. If only the ending had some of the first half's cohesion, I might have praised it almost as favourably as Die Hard. Some of the film's plot holes are so big, they come dangerously close to capsizing it. But still, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a worthwhile addition to the series. Its just starting to feel a bit stretched at this point. At least its not as noticeable here as it was with Die Hard 4.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
132,lagudafuad,Zeus was just all McClane needed to keep us glued,7,2 March 2013,"This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list.The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife.I love this movie, and Simon says, ""Everyone should go see this"" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise.www.lagsreviews.com",Die Hard with a Vengeance
133,Cinemaniac1984,Third time's the lucky charm with Die Hard With a Vengeance,9,31 January 2015,"Die Hard With a Vengeance is one of the few sequels out there that is as good as the first. I thought this was slightly better than Die Hard 2, and Die Hard 4.0 and A Good Day to Die Hard could not do better than the first three Die Hard movies. It was also good to see John McTiernan return to the director's chair.After many various blueprints of Die Hard came out such as the sequel Die Hard 2 (Die Hard in an airport), Under Siege (Die Hard on a Navy Battleship), Cliffhanger (Die Hard in the Rocky Mountains) Speed (Die Hard on a bus), and further movies such as Sudden Death (Die Hard in a Hockey Stadium), Passenger 57, Executive Decision, Air Force One and Con Air (Die Hard on a plane), and more recently Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down (Die Hard in the White House). Most of these movies have been met with mixed results, some have been box office hits, and some were not so good. Die Hard With a Vengeance is simply Die Hard in New York City, and it makes an excellent idea for an action movie.Die Hard With a Vengeance starts off with a bang, literally, when the Bonwit Teller Department Store is blown up by a mysterious terrorist named Simon (Jeremy Irons, in a crackling performance). Simon then phones the New York Police Department to take credit for the bombing and personally asks for John McClane.Lieutenant John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back with the New York Police Department after his stint with the Los Angeles Police Department in Die Hard 2, or to be more accurate, currently suspended from the NYPD. He has since separated from his wife Holly (who does not make an appearance in this movie) who is still in Los Angeles, and he is almost an alcoholic. McClane is called in by Simon to play a game aptly named Simon Says, which is to solve a number of riddles and play a number of bizarre games around New York otherwise face another bomb detonation. Following a game in which McClane must walk around Harlem with a racist sign which took a lot of guts, he is saved by an angry and bigoted shopkeeper Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) after several locals accost McClane. Simon then forces Zeus to join the game of Simon Says in which Zeus reluctantly agrees.McClane and Zeus must race against time to play Simon's sick and twisted game before more innocent lives are taken, while at the same time a bigger and much more diabolical plan is taking place. This includes solving a number of riddles across New York, and in an action packed scene, racing across Central Park in a taxi commandeered by McClane and Zeus. We also learn a bigger secret with Simon's grand scheme, one that comes back to haunt John McClane. Before Simon is able to successfully execute his grand scheme, McClane and Zeus must find Simon and successfully stop him.It was great seeing Bruce Willis back as his iconic character John McClane. He is more bitter and world weary, although he has not lost his quick witted dry humour and gutsy determination. Samuel L. Jackson as the angry storekeeper Zeus Carver made a great partner for John McClane, and everything that shows why Samuel L. Jackson a quality actor is displayed perfectly in Die Hard With a Vengeance. Jeremy Irons made a great villain. Although he previously voiced the villainous Scar in The Lion King, believe it or not this is his first real role as the main villain in a movie and Jeremy Irons is tailor made for the role as Simon.As I mentioned before, it was great to see the original director of Die Hard return to the director's chair for Die Hard With a Vengeance, and . Screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh does an excellent job with the story, continuously maintaining the rage and there is not a single dull moment. The late Michael Kamen returns as the composer and continuously maintains the exciting theme of the first two Die Hard movies.In some ways the franchise should have ended with Die Hard With a Vengeance, as this was definitely a hard act to follow. While Die Hard 4.0 was enjoyable but not great, A Good Day to Die Hard was a disappointment which signalled the death knell of the franchise. Die Hard With a Vengeance is still definitely a blockbusting enjoyable action movie, and certainly proves that third time's the lucky charm.9/10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

137,charchuk,Fresh take on the genre,8,28 March 2007,"Thankfully a return to form after the dreadful second film. Though it's not as dark as either of the first two, it's much fresher and surprisingly sharply written. The banter between Willis and Jackson makes the film, as both are at the top of the game and play off each other extremely well. I laughed more than I do in some comedies. The first hour or so, with the puzzles, is so damn entertaining that it's a shame the end turns into a generic action flick that basically copies the first film's plot. Jeremy Irons is a solid villain, and there is solid supporting work from the actors playing the cops, but the main duo is unfortunately shunted aside too often. It eventually dissolves into just another action flick, but the first hour and the humour make the overall film more than that.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
138,kdnor2011,Just a fun flick,8,2 June 2012,"Die Hard with a Vengeance is truly a 90's action movie, maybe it's just me, but this movie probably wouldn't have turned out the way it did if it were made in any other decade. It's so overblown, yet still really funny and entertaining.Basically the only real problem this movie, at least to me, is that it completely throws reality out the window. The first two, yeah they obviously could not have happened in real life, but they defienently tried for realism. This movie just says f**k it and goes so over the top. And yeah it's entertaining, but it does make it feel a little less like a sequel and more like just another 90's action movie. Plus some of the effects are bad. It doesn't have much CGI, but when McClane and Zeus are jumping off the boat it looked terrible. I have some small nitpicks, but that's about it.Really Die Hard 3 is just one of those, leave your brain at the door movies. Don't even try to solve these puzzles because they are way too difficult. Bruce Willis is still great as John McClane, and him and Samuel L. Jackson work really well together. The villain is fun, and love how it ties in with the first movie. The action scenes are great, and very well shot. There is no better way to explain this movie other than just fun. Sure the first two are a little better, but this film is just so cheesy that it makes up for any faults it has.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

It's a great sequel, it's actually better than the first and second Die Hard, but it kind of bugs me that it's John McClane again and not some other character. Then again, it would just be dumb to rename a character that is obviously McClane.I like the timing of this film. It never really stops, and I just loved the gag in the beginning, with McClane having to stand in Harlem with that sign. The interaction between Zeus and McClane is also a very good dynamic, they bounce off each other all the time.It works well. And I just loved the car chase...",Die Hard with a Vengeance

The difference between the three Die Hard's are the Third one has more adventure. I still agree that Die Hard One is The Best out of the trilogy, and the Best Willas movie. Part Two was good, but the weakest out of the three. Part Three has the most fun, as Willas joins with Samuel L Jackson together trying to stop Jeremy Irons from blowing up parts of the City. Bruce gives yet another enjoyable performance as the famous cop John Mcclaine who's always having a long day. Samuel is incredibly funny, as the racial electrician caught up with Willas. Jeremy Irons gives a splendid performance as the bad guy. The Best scene is when Bruce is forced to go Harlem, with a racist message. I didn't have a clue how he will get out of this one.

John McClane who, again, is the wrong man at the wrong place at the wrong time. Although with help from a morally racist electrician played by none other than the Maestro of Cool, Samuel L. Jackson!! Bruce Willis is as energetic and lively here, as in the previous two, and th chemistry between him and Jackson is superb. I also like to point out Jeremy Irons' almost show-stealing villainous performance as Simon, who plays a twisted game of Simon Says with McClane and company.The storyline by Jonathan Hensliegh is fresh and quite original, something of a rarity in sequels. Although yes, I do agree there is a HUGE plot hole somewhere in the middle, but come on! It by no means aims to win an Oscar, but it still has depth and heart, and cool, slick action scenes, that makes it a Die Hard film. Also, it's nice to see McTiernan directing again, injecting what he gained from the first film into here, thus giving it a ""Die Hard"" feel even more.Overall, I think this is a major improvement over the second, and its definitely one of the better action sequels out there.

Bruce Willis And John McTierman At Their Best.",10,23 November 2014,"Die Hard With A Vengeance is an excellent,thrilling and explosive sequel that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,dazzling Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Die Hard With A Vengeance a great Action sequel that is Bruce Willis and John McTierman at their best and is one of the best Action films of the 1990s.Set in New York City,Die Hard With A Vengeance has John McClane(Bruce Willis)who is now back in New York City as a NYPD cop and has to deal with a terrorist named Simon(Jeremy Irons)who is setting off bombs in the city and wants to play a game of Simon Says with John who is about to have a very bad day. Now,with the help of Harlem shop owner Zeus(Samuel L. Jackson)John McClane must put a stop to Simon and save the city.Die Hard With A Vengeance is a brilliant and thrilling Action sequel that reunited star Bruce Willis and director John McTierman(director of the first film)and created one of the best and most entertaining Action movies of the 1990s that was also my first introduction to the Die Hard series and the character John McClane and right behind the first film is my favorite Die Hard film. Die Hard With A Vengeance is an absolute blast from start to finish and is a movie that(literally)starts off with a bang instantly grabbing viewers by the throat and never letting go until the very end giving viewers a movie that is true Popcorn Movie,a film that is just memorable and fun. One of the things that makes DH3 so entertaining and watchable is the storyline because where as the first two films were set in one specific location(Nakatomi building Die Hard,Airport in Die Hard 2)DH3 takes the concept a step further using the entire city of New York as it's location which makes the movie more intense and exciting with a large scale and open space for creative scenes. Next to Bruce Willis New York City is pretty much the star of the movie and viewers see many locations of the Big Apple. The Action sequences in DH3 are amazing and intense and some of the biggest Action scenes in the Die Hard franchise with gunfights and explosions all around with the Action and thrills going at a terrific pace. DH3 is also an adventure in the truest sense of the word because there is chase sequences and various other things that happen throughout the film which will put viewers on the edge of their seats. While I did enjoy Die Hard 2 I felt the second film lacked some of the Comedic aspects of the first and thankfully the Humor was beck in this film. The Humor in DH3 is hilarious and is definitely on par with the first film in terms of laughs thanks to some of the dialog and moments in the film. The Comedy and Humor is also funny thanks to the pairing of the characters John McClane and Zeus who's back and forth banter is some of the funniest stuff you will see in a Die Hard movie and at times makes DH3 almost like a buddy Action Comedy which I think adds to the movie. When we see the character John McClane in this movie he is in a different position than he was in the first two films. In DH3 McClane is separated from his estranged wife,he's a cop on suspension and he's drunk with a bad hangover and is basically a guy down on his luck. Now,McClane has a chance to become a hero again and redeem himself by doing something he doesn't want to do:save the day and just like in the other Die Hard films we are rooting for John McClane. The ending in Die Hard With A Vengeance is terrific and filled with enough Action and excitement that will satisfy viewers. It's an ending that is not only true to Action movies but true to the whole Die Hard series. A great ending.The cast is wonderful. Bruce Willis is excellent once again as John McClane,with Willis being charismatic,cool and likable. Jeremy Irons is brilliant and unforgettable as terrorist Simon,with Irons commanding the screen in every scene he's in. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific and fun as Zeus and has great scenes and chemistry with Willis. Graham Greene(Joe Lambert),Collen Camp(Connie),Larry Bryggman(Walter Cobb),Anthony Peck(Ricky Walsh),Nick Wyman(Mathias Targo),Sam Phillips(Katya),Kevin Chamberlin(Charles Weiss),Sharon Washington(Officer Jane),Stephen Pearlman(Dr. Fred Schiller),Michael Alexander Jackson(Dexter),Aldis Hodge(Raymond),Charles Dumas(FBI Agent Andy Cross),Michael Cristofer(Bill Jarvis,from Another Organization)give good performances as well.The direction by John McTierman is fantastic,with McTierman always moving the camera and giving the movie a great pace and style and doing a terrific job with the Action scenes. Great direction,McTierman.The score by Michael Kamen is incredible,suspense and intense once again and matches the film perfectly. Fine score,Kamen. There is also the classic song Summer In The City by The Lovin' Spoonful that plays in the beginning of the film.In final word,if you love Bruce Willis,John McTierman or Action Movies.I highly suggest you see Die Hard With A Vengeance,an excellent,thrilling and explosive sequel that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
144,TheHonestCritic,"Do we finally have a good ""Die Hard"" movie in this franchise? Check out my review below to find out!",8,23 November 2020,"""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" (1995), after two very disappointing movies in this franchise, I had very little hope for this film. But, in this case, I was happy to be proven wrong. Much to my surprise, this was actually a decent movie! This film has an excellent story, great acting, perfect special effects, and a great soundtrack to tie it all together. The only real drawback in this movie are the sets/locations. Now, hear me out, there are many movies and TV shows where New York City is the primary location. It's a phenomenal setting for a story and it looks all right on-screen in this film. However, the cinematography in this case offers nothing original with the way that New York City is filmed. All of the sets/locations do their job, but the look of the areas utilized in this movie are just underwhelming for me. Now, let's get to the positives. The storyline may sound like your everyday terrorists seizing control with bomb threats plot. But, the way it's expressed here is unique and a lot of fun to watch. Simon, played by Jeremy Irons, is the leader of the terrorist group, has John McClane complete different tasks, otherwise he'll detonate one of the different bombs. This time, John has a partner named Zeus Carver, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Both of them work very well together as they play along with Simon's different riddles to prevent the bombs from exploding. This is an action movie done right, it keeps me completely invested from beginning to end, wondering what's going to happen next with a few laughs along the way. That's how you do an action film! Plus, the fight scenes were so much better. John McClane actually got more hits on the bad guys and it wasn't nearly as one-sided as the previous two movies. I just thought to myself: ""finally! That's what I'm talking about."" As for the acting, it's just as strong as the plot. Bruce Willis nails it as John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Zeus Carver and Jeremy Irons is stellar as Simon. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson sounds like a peculiar duo for a movie. But, they work perfectly together and their chemistry is stellar! Jeremy Irons gives a cold, calculating, yet suave performance as the main villain. All of the other actors and actresses fire on all cylinders as well! In this case, a good script equals great performances. All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Michael Kamen is excellent. He really knocked it out of the park with the film score, because it helps set the tone perfectly for this movie. ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is the ""Die Hard"" film I was hoping for since the first one. Turns out, I just had to get through two subpar movies first. But thankfully, it was worth the wait. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"", go check it out today! Usually, a third film in a franchise is when it starts to get redundant and go downhill. However, in the rare exception of ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"", third time's the charm!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
145,Brian-272,Great Movie! More thrills and excitement with Bruce Willis a must see!,7,21 May 2001,"I  remember in May of 1995 seeing this at the movies with my friends and we came out to my friends car and talked about what a great movie we saw. This Die Hard almost ranks as good as the original, and better than the second. Bruce Willis is once again great plus you have Samuel L. Jackson who gives a fine performance. All the excitement and action of this Die Hard keeps you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy this if you haven't already. One of the better action movies made!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
146,mnpollio,Excruciating on multiple levels,1,26 June 2007,"It is nearly impossible to comprehend how a relatively durable series like Die Hard could take such a devastating crash in this third (and worst) outing. The original was an immensely enjoyable action spectacle. While the sequel lacked its predecessors intelligence, it was fast-paced and entertaining. By contrast, this latest effort is a tiresome, chaotic waste. Part of the problem is that the plot was reportedly taken from other sources and usurped by the Die Hard franchise and the shoe-horning shows. Does anyone buy for a moment that the married couple we watched in the first two films has inexplicably separated again and the heroic McClane (Bruce Willis) has turned into a washed-up embittered old drunk? The film makes a major misstep out of the starting gate by presenting a character that we are familiar with from two prior films and depicting him in a way and in a state that makes little narrative sense. The plot (such as it is) also relies heavily on coincidence, illogic motivation and general stupidity. The villain is played by Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons, who is purportedly the brother of the Alan Rickman character from the original, and who turns in a performance so dreadful it must be seen to be believed. He drops clues to various traps/bombs around NYC and has McClane and the police running frantically all over the place. In the absence of the reliable Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson, the plot rather incoherently conspires a reason to throw together the belabored Willis with an African-American shop owner, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Rather than amusing banter a la Lethal Weapon, we get two characters, particularly in Jackson's case, who seem to actively despise each other for the duration of the film. Worse, Jackson is portrayed as an over-the-top racist/bigot, who can barely make it through any scene without some raging anti-white sentiment amidst a flurry of foul language being unleashed. It is wearisome enough that the filmmakers actually seem to think this should be funny, but even worse it shows Jackson schooling his grandchildren in this same sort of vile outlook and tries to play it for cheap laughs. Of course, then this is used as the set-up for a predictably lazy action sequence later on which firmly highlights the film's total lack of originality. When it becomes apparent that a school is one of Irons' bombing targets, it is a foregone conclusion that the following will fall into place: a) it will be the school attended by Jackson's grandchildren, and b) there will be some ludicrous cockamamie reason why the grandchildren will be the only ones not evacuated from the school forcing a dire rescue attempt. Interestingly, the prior films in the series did provide a colorful cast of supporting characters to help/hinder the hero in his venture. Not so here, where the supporting cast is relatively interchangeable and instantly forgettable. The action sequences are utterly devoid of any tension or excitement, and the finale pretty much sputters out like a match in the wind. One can only hope that more than a decade has given the filmmakers some insight in which to improve the upcoming sequel from the debacle they hit with this one.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
147,patches89,SAY HELLO TO YOUR BROTHER!!,9,7 February 2021,"This is the second best film in the franchise and this time its not set during christmas and is more of a summer blockbuster as Hans Grubers brother Simon played brilliantly by Jeremy Irons sets well laid challenges for McClane and his unexpected civiliant partner Zeus (Samuel L Jackson). These challenges takes the pair all over the city as a cover for a heist that was underway. Again the story is solid, a little improvement on the good second film and the characters helped enhance it. The action scenes were superb making another great edition in the franchise",Die Hard with a Vengeance
148,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,The greatest best action 90's film of all time a masterpice the third sequel my personal number 1 favorite action flick!,10,2 January 2020,"One of my personal favorite 90's action films of all time! Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) is a masterpiece a true third sequel to Die Hard (1988). Bruce Willis and John McTiernan reuinited. John McTiernan directed this masterpiece perfect. John McTiernan and Jonathan Hensleigh ignored Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990) and focus on a different story not by novel and a true sequel to the original ""Die Hard"" film. I love this film to death! It is my film, it is my favorite action film. It is my number 1 favorite action film of all time.Just like first Die Hard I love this movie to Death! I have DVD, Blu-ray disc and VHS about this movie. My aunt taped me the VHS 10 years ago and I am greatful to have this movie in widescreen and I have the DVD. I have the film on Blu-ray disc. Been fan of both of the films for almost 15 years and I still love them both to death. I love the music, the action, the story, John McClane, the qoutes, I love everything about this movie.I deply enjoy both of the films the original and this one. Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) is the third film in the popular Die Hard franchise, which re teamed Bruce Willis with John McTiernan, the director of the first film. It is my number 1 favorite Die Hard film in the franchise with the original they are both equal to me. It feel's fast paced, more realistic and more action movie to me. This is a Die hard film and it is in my top 15 favorite action films of all time! Simon Gruber and his sex babe Katya are great couple on screen who are messing with McClane, I love that. Why can't we get villians like that nowdays? John McTiernan directed masterpiecful both of the movies. John McTiernan is really missed nowdays he directed really great flicks. (Predator, The Hunt for Red October, The 13th Warrior and The Thomas Crown Affair yes I liked that film, because of Rene Russo at the time she was my crush and she was one hot sexy babe.)With a more worthwhile script, the addition of Samuel L. Jackson as a good samaritan with attitude, and all of New York City is blowing up as McClane and Carver are playing ground for a game of ""Simon Says"", we have a more efficient ass-kicking Die Hard from the director of the original classic. Tons of action, our heroes trough inter first half of the film are solving a puzzle of a riddle to find a code for the deactiviting a bomb that is actually somewhere hidden in a school. McClane and Carver must solve the riddle on specific time or the school blows up. Police officers and firemans are searching for the bomb in the city, around thousand buildings in New York City. While Simon who is actually a former National People's Army colonel turned terrorist a mastermind is ploting a heist, revenge is only a decoy. Vengeance also links Die Hard 1 with the Simon character as Hans Grubers brother which adds to the irritation of McClaines duty. At first it seens that Simon has a score to settle with Detective McClane, but it was actually a heist a $140 billion dollars worth of gold bullion from the Federal Reserve Bank.I love this film to death, the music score from Michael Kamen is great again. This is the third movie in the ""Die Hard"" franchise the budget for this movie was $90 million which cost more expensive than the first two movies did. The movie has tons of action scens that I love: That raising taxi ride through Central Park was a bad-ass. I love McClane and Carver running trought the streets and you can see World Trade Center the Twin Towers that was before 9/11 attacks. This is the last action film I saw that was filmed entirely in New York City. After 9/11 I think action films were forbidden filming in New York City I love the Twin Towers in this movie. I love McClane fires his Beretta 92FS during the car chase killing bad guys in a car pursuing him and Carver. I love how we found out that McClane, Targo and Carver were all double crossed by Simon and Katya. I love that McClane does not kill Targo in this movie. I love the finale in which McClane, armed only with a small revolver, shoots an overhead power line that falls onto the helicopter, crashing and kills the bad guys, it is practical well done effect. Love his one line ""Yippie-Kai-Yay Mother*****."" I love when McClane and Carver are climbing on a tanker by wire trough the car 1994 Chevrolet C/K-Series holding the line, and the car crashes over the bridge and they both fly I love that scene. I love the fight between Targo and McClane on a tanker. I love exploding train on a trail road, McClane jumps on a train and he looks for a bomb. McClane saves all those passengers on a train, he throws the bomb out of the train. I love the facts that they are saving kids from the school and the bomb was a fake and a decoy. The tanker scene where McClane and Carver are handcudffs togethe McClane saves both of them. You see exploding tanker excellent practical FX effect they are done for real.For 1995 action film it is a masterpiece sequel to me. Bruce Willis best performance I have ever seen. Die Hard, Die Hard: With a Vengeance and The Last Boy Scout were the movies that I kept watching for Bruce Willis. Samuel L. Jackson was a good heart human being. He try to prevent a disater in Harlem and I love that he try to save a white men from a massacre I love that in this film. Jeremy Irons is a bad-ass as Simon Gruber (Hans older brother) I love Irons in this film. Sam Phillips is a babe as Katya terrorist mute but sexy deadly girlfriend of Simon. Larry Bryggman as NYPD Inspector Walter Cobb is great boss to McClane. Larry Bryggman did a really good job playing his character well. Colleen Camp as NYPD Detective Connie Kowalski looked like my mom in 1995. I was 11 years old this movie come out. Colleen Camp was great I love her so much I miss the actress. Nick Wyman as Mathias Targo is excellent he is great I love him. Kevin Chamberlin as Charles Weiss a bomb expert was great I love his character. I love the cast everyone does a great job in this movie.I love the action the opening sequence you see the cars. I love the soundtracks Summer in the City by The Lovin' Spoonful and When Johnny Comes Marching Home by (loosely based on Johannes Brahms' ""Symphony No.1, 1st Movement""). Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) is my number 1 personal favorite action film of all time I love everything about this movie. I love Die Hard (1988) and this movie and Live Free or Die Hard to death! Vengeance is better than Die Hard 2: Die Harder or A Good Day to Die Hard!! Those aren't Die Hard movies to me. I don't care what anyone says this is my opinion! I love Die Hard 3 to death I love it, It is Rated R and it is bloody and I miss movies nowdays like this. Why can't we get action movies like this nowdays? They don't blow buildings and anything nowdays anymore. Classic masterpiece for action fans! Belongs with Hard Boiled, Hard Target, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, cliffhanger, Predator 2 and Demolition Man one of the greatest 90's action films of all time! :P.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
149,refresh_daemon,An enjoyable action romp with twists; almost as good as the original,8,14 January 2008,"Die Hard with a Vengeance is the rightful successor to the original Die Hard. While it sheds a number of supporting characters from the previous films as well as the formula of terrorists taking over some building, it gains an able co-star in Samuel L. Jackson, a good villain, more twists and turns than the previous films, a better story than Die Hard 2 and a handful of supporting characters that aren't distractingly ridiculous.The story is this: A madman named Simon wants McClane dead and will blow up all of Manhattan to get it. Of course, there are lots of twists and complications that show up to make this more than just the story of a mad bomber vs. McClane. The twists and turns are mostly convincing, only occasionally stretching the bounds of believability. One issue with the story is that it basically ignores Die Hard 2 in continuity, so it confused me when McClane at the beginning states that the distance between NY and LA caused a rift between him and his wife--in DH2, McClane became an LAPD officer and was in DC for a little bit. But besides the continuity confusion and the regular contrivances in action movies of this type, the story is a workable piece, helped in part by adding a personal story for its leading character, which was sorely missing in DH2.The action itself doesn't quite hit the highs of Die Hard or the ridiculousness of Die Hard 2, but still manages to be engaging and entertaining. Furthermore, the inclusion of puzzles and riddles and obstacle-course like challenges are surprisingly entertaining. The pacing suffers a little when unnecessary story elements rear their head--some elements, like multiple criminal organizations--seem to have been written out, but not completely, leading to some confusion.The direction is engaging if plain, the acting rapport is good, the production values are high and the movie is generally fun. While DHwaV doesn't reach the same highs at Die Hard, in getting a chance to break free from the formula and follow a different path, it becomes something that's almost engaging and fun as the previous Die Hard. As such, it's an enjoyable film that will sate your desire for a fun action movie, but as with previous Die Hard films, you shouldn't expect a moving or intellectually or emotionally compelling work. It's fun. 8/10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
150,moviewiz-4,This is one of the best of die hard,8,3 November 2000,"This movie is better than the first one, although i enjoy all the three movies, i can say this is good.Some setting in the city make me feel like in everyday life but more surprise on how the producer can bring the city to halt for the movie shooting.One thing about this movie is the camera movement in some part of the scene which is not good enough.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
151,MAYESY-44,Who doesn't love Die Hard,10,27 May 2020,"Brilliant movie with a brilliant storyline and made all the better having Samuel L Jackson to team up with Bruce Willis, genius idea that brought even more life to the franchise.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
152,stormhawk2021,Almost as good as its two predecessors,7,9 August 2018,"""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" was the first ""Die Hard"" I saw in the theater and it's my favorite of the sequels. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back and this time he's not in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's the right man, being targeted by a terorrist bomber named Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), Hans' brother, who wants to play a game of ""Simon Says"". If McClane doesn't do as he says, then he will blow up anything from a subway to a school in New York. McClane gets help from Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) a guy who saves his life in Harlem, and they try to stop Simon and find out why he is doing all this. John McTiernan was the director of the first movie and this is the only sequel he came back for, probably why it's the best. The action is phenomenal, the story is exciting, and Irons' Simon is the best of all the villains in the series, besides Hans Gruber. There are some scenes that are very over the top, but this is probably the most grounded of the entire series. Great movie, and if your looking for a roller coaster ride of a movie, then pop this bad boy back in.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
153,CriticsVoiceVideo,Better than second sequel.,6,1 April 2021,"This should have been the second sequel. It has the spirit, humor, and vibe of the original. Some weird unnecessary racial commentary throughout the whole film though.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

It is much more original than its predecessor, and has much higher-caliber supporting players in Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson--not to mention the best director the franchise has ever had.This was great to see once again, and I STILL have nightmares with that wicked Katya (played by composer Sam Phillips) slicing my head off with that sick blade of hers...",Die Hard with a Vengeance
156,Old Joe,Think Fast. Look Alive...,10,6 March 2001,"After seeing two of these films, I thought that the third could not be any better than the first two. It was an original theme, with a great story and cast. But somehow they did it again, Die Hard with a vengeance is one the great action movies of our time. This is one of the biggest heart-stoppers that you will ever see.Detective John McClane has seen his share of bad days, but this time, Simon says McClane is going to have a really bad day. A man calling himself ""Simon"" begins a reign of terror in the streets of New York: he threatens to detonate bombs around the city unless McClane and his accomplice cooperate in a game of ""Simon Says"". McClane has a bad hangover and a bad attitude, and isn't in the mood for games, especially this one. Reprising the role as Police Detective John McClane is Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis. I love this character, because he has no care for the consequences for his actions, but does care that innocent people can be hurt or killed because of him. To help of set the insane character of McClane is the talented Samuel L. Jackson. He stars as Zeus Carver and I must admit that these characters were great to watch. The tension between McClane and Carver was another aspect to this movie that made it so fascinating. While they are trying to save the day, they question each others preferences towards one another. Yet in the end they accept each other for who they really are and become good mates. Some of the dialogue between those guys was very funny. Samuel L Jackson has had a fair career starring in some impressive films such as Deep Blue Sea, Star Wars, The Negotiator, Rules Of Engagement and lately Unbreakable.When Simon says, McClane does. The main bad guy in this Die Hard is Jeremy Irons. Again I loved this character because of his accent it was great to listen to, especially in the scenes where Simon calls up and barks out his instructions. Bruce Willis said that getting Jeremy Irons as a Bad Guy' was great for this film and I tend to agree with him. His character also plays a huge part in this movie to why it was so different and captivating for me. McClane and Zeus are sent on a wild goose chase all over New York City and have many different riddles and games to play and solve, with many of them having a do or die consequences attached. The credit for this in part needs to go to director of Die Hard, the original, and back in Die Hard 3, John McTiernan. He has a great sense of the unknown and brings it to the screen just nicely. I must also say that the storywriters did a fine job in Die Hard With A Vengeance. The games and the revenge parts of the script were cleverly written.So, I must admit that Die Hard With A Vengeance is my favourite of the Die Hard films, if not one of my favourite films of all-time. Bruce Willis is one actor I will be looking out for. I want to finally say that this movie is full of sarcasm. Now it mightn't be that friendly to hear, but makes for interesting viewing. With it, it delivers great tension and at times some funny humour. I heard on the grapevine last year (2000) that Die Hard 4 was to be made, if it is I hope it can be as breathtaking as it's predecessors. The description by Clark Forbes of the Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun says it all about Die Hard 3:""The best car chases since BULLIT, a better subway crash than SPEED, bigger blasts than any LETHAL WEAPON...the hardest toughest one of all.""Yippy Kay Aye, Movie Lovers!Rating 4.5 Stars or 9.5/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
157,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995),8,5 July 2008,If you like action movies you have probably already seen the Die Hard movies. If you haven't what are you still doing here. Go now and get them all. Third installment keeps Die Hard at the top as the best action movies of all time.This is much less serious then the other films. It goes for comedy and action. This is the second worse Die Hard. With number 1 as Die Hard. The best action movie ever. Then with the fun Die Hard 4. Then this coming in third then Die Hard 2 coming in last.Again Bruce Willis brings back John McClane. He still owns it. The villain sucked. He seemed way too soft. Hans Gruber still owns.Same as always this is not for kids. Has the same graphic violence and bad language.I highly recommend. Make sure you have seen the first two before seeing this.8/10,Die Hard with a Vengeance
158,j-lacerra,Died Hard: What a Clunker!,1,8 June 2008,"After reading some of the enthusiastic reviews on this site, I was looking forward to watching this picture tonight. As it turns out, this clunker is not even in the same league with the first of the series, and is not even half as good as the second, which was itself an irretrievable clunker.Here we have Willis clunking (sorry about the repetition, but variations of this word keep coming to mind) through the role of the remains of John McClane, Jackson an argumentative whiney racist, and Jeremy Irons smirking the part of the inevitable criminal mastermind.If you enjoy the game of guessing what the next plot turn is going to be, you'll find no challenges here. The only unpredictable element of this movie is how bad it can get. There is no chemistry between Willis and Jackson, no interesting bad guys, no diverting back story, and no humor. Oh, the action scenes are boring and the pacing is choppy. One to avoid.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
159,buzznzipp1995,"Die Hard, Does it Again... in New York City!!!",10,27 July 2006,"WOW!!! Bruce is back baby!! Talk about that 'lightning' striking again!! It's Powerful stuff! He starts out in a slow and 'sober' manner literally and catches his first, second and then third 'Wind' through out the movie. As he crosses paths with a kind Samaritan, from Harlem... what a team! He (McClain) didn't even need a partner, but it works, explosively well, I think. The first 'Die Hard' was amazing, the second was better than a lot of other movies at that time, but not as great as the first, however, this one blows-back onto the scene. From the beginning, it grabs anyone with a 'pulse' and then works the story through and through, tightly weaving it and bringing wild-action and of course that famous-made McClain- 'attitude' by Willis and McTiernan the original directer and the best suited for this crack-action New York centered drama. Transferred from L.A. of course.With the pressure coming down all around them, McClain and Carver(Willis & Jackson) stumble around, back and forth a little and get their footing, (barely sometimes), but keep their 'Wits' about them and a sense of humor, just to survive and deal with the cuts, bruises and then find their strength and deliver some deadly blows to their adversaries, with razor sharp accuracy! This was better than I had hoped for, considering dreading most sequels. Abandoning my thought for them as just Hollywood 'looking for more money' in most cases. This series has come really far for me, considering that I thought the first Die Hard was gonna be just a 'senseless', maybe even stupid undertaking. Man, was I wrong! I enjoyed the respect for good original story and plot, that John McTeirnan -Director and the novelist Roderick Thorp had in working to make this one stay in the best of the best category of FILM. The only part that I would have omitted was the water in the tube pushing that 14-ton dump truck along and John, surfing it then grabbing that drainage grate cover. He would of had a crushed chest cavity! Altogether, that would have to be ""GOD"" helping John through that one, because I think that would be at the very least, a very complicated feat, even for the 'Terminator'.To any and all Willis fans even those who don't care about him...see the film! If you want the edited version to remove curse-words etc watch it on T.V. or you could go to 'Cleanfilms'.com and exercise your 'freedom of speech'(****)",Die Hard with a Vengeance
160,kingofdanerds,Very comparable to the original,10,9 November 2021,"Die Hard is often considered (by me and many others) to be one of the greatest action films of all time. A sequel of lesser quality (yet still enjoyable) would be released and a third film, Die Hard With a Vengeance, was released in 1995. The film sees the return of director John McTiernan and stars Bruce Willis, Jeremy Irons, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film would receive mixed reviews upon release, but many fans call it one of the best Die Hard sequels. The film was a box office hit and ended up being the highest grossing film of 1995.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back in New York. His wife has left him and he has become an alcoholic. When a mysterious terrorist named Simon (Jeremy Irons), who has a personal vendetta against McClane, is threatening the city with bombs, McClane enlists in the help of an electronic store owner (Samuel L. Jackson) to try and stop this mysterious terrorist.Die Hard With A Vengeance is criminally underrated by critics but I am glad that this film has such a huge fanbase. I'll say it right now. Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a great film. Is it as big as the original? No. But it has fun in it's own ways. The action scenes are very solid and the whole film is paced extremely well that even when there are not any action scenes, viewers will not get bored of this film at any point. If I am to make any complaint at all is the seemingly tacked on ending of the film. Sure, it is fine, but when compared to what all happened previously, it felt weaker. Still fun. Many prefer the alternative ending to this film and I would agree. The whole set up of this mysterious terrorist playing a deadly game of Simon Says is really interesting and is intense to watch. I am left wondering what will happen next because the villain has his own set of rules and he can be unpredictable at times which makes it all the more intense and fun. The acting is great and the true stars here are Willis and Jackson. Willis is great as John McClane as to be expected. Jackson's character is rightfully not used as a lesser sidekick or even a comedic relief, though there are some comedic moments between the two. He is just as important as a character as McClane. The two together on screen are just fantastic. Important topics about race is brought up and I am actually glad that it is brought up. Even though the two characters do not seem to like each other at all in the beginning, it is nice to see this complex relationship being built up between the two of them as the events of the film unfold. They just have great chemistry together. With the musical score, this is the film that will forever have ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" stuck in my head. But outside of that, this film has a good musical score.Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an extremely fun film that would make for a good double feature with the original Die Hard. Great characters and great action scenes are all to be expected here. Honestly, while Die Hard 2 is a good film, you could easily skip that film and go straight to this one.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
161,kyle-cruse,"Exciting sequel, though probably my least favorite in the series",8,16 September 2008,"You know ""Die Hard"" is a good series when even the least good sequel is still a very good film. The action in ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" never slows down for a minute. Not only is Bruce Willis nearly as good as John McClane as he was before, but now we have the great Samuel L. Jackson to add more great elements to the film. His fights with McClane make the movie and manage to entertain to the fullest. Jeremy Irons also plays a great villain as Simon, telling riddles to intimidate McClane before setting off bombs that threaten to destroy New York City. He still cannot measure up to the brilliance of Alan Rickman's villain from the first film, but he is easily the second-best villain in the series. The action scenes are great, particularly the race to stop the subway from blowing up. The scene at the pay phone is very exciting as well. It is inferior to the original, as well as the other two sequels, however. This film lacks great scenes of character development like the first film had. All the dialogue scenes here are mainly used as arguments between Willis and Jackson. Also, the action gets very tedious after a while, and the viewer may be too stressed after so many races through the streets. It is very enjoyable nonetheless. Action movie lovers will embrace this film. What an exciting ride, worthy of this great film series.*** out of ****",Die Hard with a Vengeance
162,AwesomeWolf,Die Hard: With Awesome,8,26 May 2005,"'Die Hard' was awesome because it featured an action hero who was vulnerable and had weaknesses, unlike most action heroes, and all the action was limited exclusively to the one setting. 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance' is awesome because it completely dispensed with anything that was unique about the first, and turned into an awesome action movie, completely different from the action awesomeness of the original. Awesome.A terrorist named Simon threatens to bring New York to a standstill. Specifically asking for John McClane (Bruce Willis), Simon plays ""Simon Says... or a bunch of bombs explode"" with McClane. In short, it's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas for the hungover McClane.John McTiernan returns as director after Renny Harlin directed 'Die Hard 2'. If you ignore 'Rollerball', McTiernan is a rather awesome director of awesome action movies. Like I said, McTiernan dumps the formula from the first and second, and takes 'Die Hard' in a totally different, but just as awesome, direction. The story may be as solid as the first, but the massive gaps in logic from the second don't really appear in the third. Well, they do, they just aren't as massive.As an action movie, Die Hard 3 is one of the best. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson get to run around New York trying to foil the bad guy, and generally causing chaos where ever they go. For a series of gun fights and explosions, Die Hard 3 is actually pretty exciting.While it still can't beat the original, Die Hard 3 is a great sequel, and is a little better than the second.

164,johnny-08,Intelligent and funny action movie,8,20 September 2007,"From the first Die Hard movie I was looking for worthy sequel. And I found it. ""Die Hard 3"" is definitely my favorite Die Hard movie after the first movie. It is also obvious that it's impossible to compare first movie with the others, but director John McTiernan (director of first Die Hard) found a recipe to make another good movie. And that is ""Die Hard 3"" in my books. I didn't like ""Die Hard 2"" mostly because of bad casting and totally impossible situations. ""Die Hard 3"" is opposite of that. We've got brilliant Jeremy Irons as bad guy and one big surprise: Samuel L. Jackson. Why surprise? Because Jackson really astonished me with the way he acted with Willis. Their team work is amazing and that is one of the reasons why this movie is so successful. There are lots of very funny situations where they are arguing about something. From Willis entry into Harlem with that sign to their driving in old Yugo car. I just loved all that. Also there aren't lots of impossible situations. Like that battle on the wing of the plane in second part. Actually there aren't any situations that are out of ordinary in this movie. All of that you can swallow. What can I say more; only that I love this movie and I will always find positive word to describe it.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

166,CrassActionHero,This Movie Reeks of Attitude.,8,5 November 2006,"Welcome to the third installment of Die Hard.Review: Die Hard With a Vengeance is more than just you typical action flick, this movie has a lot of attitude. The action here is intense. Our hero McClane is back with a bad hangover. Not your typical hero, but our hero. He is still full of attitude. After a rather nasty situation in Harlem, McClane and a Harlem shopkeeper named Zeus Carver are in a situation with a mad bomber and have to play these cat and mouse games around New York.Zeus Carver(Samuel L. Jackson)is primed with just as much attitude as McClane. The games that they play involve some over the top but great scenes. From jumping on to a subway train to driving a cab through Central Park! The story here is also the initial bond these two develop over this period of time.Though all the chaos, all the mayhem, we learn a lot about our heroes. McClane has changed a bit and Zeus is conflicted. They become pals despite the fact that they did not know one another just before eight o'clock that morning.The action that happens is also fun and terrific. The mad villain is quite the villain and has a reason to cause such chaos. McClane and Zeus have some of the best one-liners in the history of movies. Just awesome.Bruce Willis is just solid as McClane. Samuel L. Jackson is not only solid as Zeus, but seems to be having a lot of fun here. The plot is great. The Villain here is also having fun here too. As a matter of fact, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves here.The Last Word: Intense.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
167,arthera09,I love this movie,8,31 May 2007,"I think this movie would have only gotten a 7 if they never made Die Hard 2, but since this was so much better than Die Hard 2 it gets a 9. The whole premises feels very real especially after 9/11. I love how Jeremy Irons is the bad guy. Something we can learn from this Die Hard and the first Die Hard is that it pays off to get good actor for your bad guy. They are not evil, they are just really really greedy. I like the line ""I am a soldier not a monster"" characterizes both Hans and Simon very well. Jackson was perfect in this and they need him to add a new level to the series. Just having a one man army feels a bit old. Since the main bad guy had a vengeance issue it was not absurd that John got mixed up into the whole thing. The one thing that did annoy me was leaving out Holly. I love that lady and how she made him human. But they did reduce him to being an alcoholic which showed she was what made John great, but the fact he could bounce back showed that he can still do some damage, but needed a new friend. I loved how it took place in the NYC and I could recognize some of the sights and the streets. I think I walked on one of the same streets last week while I was visiting my brother. After seeing how bad the second movie is this movie just felt so right. They did not try to force any crazy characters in there and they stuck to a tried and true formula and pulled it off quite well.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
168,fredericksmith1952,YEAH! John McTiernan back at the helm.,10,25 March 2012,"YEAH! John McTiernan back at the helm. Not that Renny did a horrible job, but this Die Hard comes back to the energy level of the original. John and Holly are heading toward their inevitable divorce, John is back in New York, and now we introduce a couple of wild cards into the mix. Samuel L. Jackson plays Zeus Carver, a businessman in Harlem who does not like white people. Jeremy Irons plays Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans using his desire to take revenge on McClane as an elaborate diversion from his real goal, a robbery of international proportions. Graham Greene and Colleen Camp add a nice flair with their roles, and Bruce gives us an interesting perspective on McClane's development. Like the previous two films, the action is non stop and the good guys prevail, but it is never that simple. There is always one more thing to do. Rated R for violence, language, and a brief passionate encounter. Collectible if you love Willis or just want to have the entire set.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
169,LuboLarsson,Superb,8,20 May 2003,"The third Die Hard film continues the trend of the first two and delivers a no-stop rollercoaster ride of thrills and spills. Bruce Willis is great in his signature role of John McLane, the director of the original Die Hard is back on board PLUS Samuel L. Jackson co stars in this one! The story is great too plus using the whole of New York instead of using the confines of a skyscraper or airport makes a nice change from the previous two. I'd rate this the second best of the series so far (with Die Hard 4 on the way), just a notch below the original, but considering this is the third film of a series this film really delivers. A lot of film series have a disappointing third parts e.g Lethal Weapon III, Godfather Part III, Return of the Jedi, Superman III, Rambo III etc etc, but this one bucks the trend, roll on Die Hard 4!",Die Hard with a Vengeance

171,Mickey Knox,who said sequels always s*ck?,8,7 December 2000,"I watched Die Hard 3 for the first time about 2 years ago and i totally loved it. I am not a huge action movie fan, i always loved more the movies that actually use your brain at least a little bit, but i have to say that this film is probably one of the best action movies i have ever seen. I saw it again last night and, again, i liked it a lot.It's maybe one of the very few cases in which the sequel is better than the original. Cause Die Hard 3 is better, more spectacular and more thrilling than both DH1 and DH2. This time, Bruce Willis (John McClane) has to deal with the brother of the terrorist he killed in the first part - role played very well by Jeremy Irons. Simon (that's his name) puts Bruce to a series of games, riddles and puzzles, decided to revenge for what Bruce did to his brother.Well in this movie Bruce is not alone fighting the bad guys. He has a new ""best friend"" - a black racist played absolutely superbly by one of my all time fav actors, Samuel L Jackson. They are brilliant together, with very funny one liners and a perfect chemistry. (They both have played in another movie - Pulp Fiction - but in that film they actually never had not even one scene together).The movie kicks off very good, with Simon (Jeremy Irons) putting the duo to a series of mind games, with the threat of blowing up high quality bombs in public places. The first part of the film is thrilling and exciting - that's what i call a perfect action movie. You just can't get your eyes off the screen. The second part is a bit different though. The action loses from imagination and thrill once we get to the point where we find out what Simon really wants. From this moment, the film becomes a classic action, with no difference from all the action movies out there.In conclusion, an enjoyable film, that you definetely should watch. I think the only action movie better than this one is Speed. Vote: 8 out of 10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

173,jmillerdp,Jumbled and Overwrought,1,5 July 2013,"""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is essentially the victim of overthinking. Different scripts were considered, and rejected for whatever reasons. In the end, they took a script by Jonathan Hensleigh (the very unfortunate screenwriter of Michael Bay trainwrecks like ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon"") and tweaked it a little to make this movie.The first half goes okay enough. When the movie leaves Manhattan, it becomes a jumble of random action scenes. There is no real narrative consistency, it just meanders. I know they wanted to not make a ""Die Hard on a Boat,"" etc. But, by going the opposite direction and having a dozen different locations, it just makes it seem like they patched it together as they went along.The performances are good, in general. Willis is always ready to go. But, Sam Jackson just does his angry black man routine, like he has in most of his movies. John McTiernan is a good director, but is one of those directors who shoots the script he's given. So, if it's a messed-up script, he shoots it without questioning it. After the movie goes on and on in its last hour, you want to just wrap it up.A major problem here is that they give McClane a sidekick, which he certainly doesn't need! I think that the producers and everyone else got freaked out by the fact that McClane talks to himself in the first two movies. So, they give him a sidekick. This has continued ever since. I think people just can't handle it if someone isn't psychologically right down the middle. So, if you have a guy talking to himself, people think ""Can't have that!""Plus, gone is producer Joel Silver, who made the first two movies. This time, it's in the heavyhanded grasp of the producers who did ""Rambo."" So, there's gotta be a lot of blood and crazy-ass action, with little humor or sense of character. So it is with this movie, and the others that followed.The final action scene is good, but comes too late to make a difference. I know lots of people love this ""Die Hard,"" but it does nothing for me, either then when I first saw it or now. In fact, when I saw it on opening day, I was in such shock that they actually made this the third ""Die Hard"" that I gave it a ""B"" on the CinemaScore card, when I actually would've given it an ""F"" if I were of sound mind at the time!* (1 Out of 10 Stars)",Die Hard with a Vengeance
174,Chromium_5,They should have quit while they were ahead,5,7 September 2005,"Some people seem to have the idea that ""Die Hard 3"" is the best in the series. Some clarification is needed here, because it's actually the worst. It starts out on the right note with an interesting premise (mysterious stranger toying with John for unknown reasons), but at the halfway point, right about the time we actually see the villain, it gets so sloppy it's almost as if they're improvising the plot as they go. I'm too tired to go through all the things wrong with it, but suffice it to say the villain seems to have more people working for him than the entire New York City police department.The main downfall of this one is that McTiernan got confused and thought he was making a ""Lethal Weapon"" movie. Someone really should have mentioned to him that he was supposed to be making ""Die Hard,"" but too late he pulled in Sam L. Jackson as a store owner with absolutely no reason or motivation of any kind to be helping McClane. He's just there to yell a lot and cause racial tension. The awesome lone-wolf formula from the first two movies becomes the overused, irritating buddy-cop formula (only Jackson's not a cop, just some random black guy). Jackson is a great actor, but his character has no real place in this movie.Add some sub-par acting and an ending so abrupt it's almost like the screenwriter just gave up, and the result is a total wash. I'm not saying it's terrible--it has its moments--but it's nowhere near as good as the first one. I understand they're making a fourth one. I don't have high hopes for it. They should have quit while they were ahead.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
175,athena24,Yu-Pi-Ki-Yey,6,31 August 2005,"After the wonderful first Die Hard, and a little silly but still decently made second one, comes the worst in the series (at least until now). It's not all bad. Definitely it has good moments: The main idea of this film when the bad guy tells good guy what to do, or else he blows something. The missions are truly funny (in a good way). The action is OK. Samuel Jackson plays his part well, and definitely contributes to this sequel. The opening scene is wonderful when Joe Cocker's version of Hot Town plays in the background and ... Explosion... we are officially entered to the plot of the movie, can take our seats and enjoy. OK, I did enjoy the movie's first hour and a half. And then it's like the director ran out of script and began to improvise. An online plot. And i'm not trying to find holes in the script, i'm trying to find the script in those holes.Common, John McClane, the guy who fights till his last breath ( though doing it in his take-it-easy Willis way ) is get caught here? And what, the bad guys spare him? I mean Simon Gruber spares him after everything McClane did for his brother, I'm sure he would like to see him dead. I'm repeating, SEE him dead.I Suppose Simon didn't like his brother ( actually he and McClane agreed on that) and decided to half-spare him. But of course McClane dies hard and ... well .. actually he didn't die ( he was needed for the good ending and apparently for the Die Hard 4. Although he could die, but then they would make Die Hard Zero, or Die Hard The Beginning. This would tell us about early Johnny McClane). Zeus Carver also dies hard, that means he also didn't die in the movie, although he should die on the boat explosion cause his last scene was totally unnecessary.After The police finds out the ""bad guys'"" location they go to get them, and what do you think of Zeus Carver ( Samuel Jackson). He also goes with them, he flies with McClane on same chopper to get the ""bad guys"". He must have been registered to the police force during the flight though the director didn't show us the flight itself. I still don't get what Zeus did on that chopper.He intended to shout at the villains? It must have been so. Maybe he has an ultrasonic voice that can damage the surroundings? Anyway the director was late about this, cause McClane already killed the ""bad guys"". He hit the electricity cable with his revolver from something like 90 feet and the cable hit the chopper where Simon was.End of story. Wait a minute. Did I tell you how the police finds the ""bad guys""? No first, how did they loose them. 17 Trucks full of gold, one after the other in a row, driving silently, unnoticed, in the streets of New York. Yeh, sure they are. Who can possibly think someone would notice them? The only logical explanation i find is that each of the trucks was in a garage where they made a new color and fixed the engine (GTA). OK so the dumb police looses the trucks and smart McClane, after 2 hours of sweat chaises and fights where he was almost killed in an explosion and solved a logic riddle while saving many innocent citizens' lives, he finally finds ""the bad guys"". McClain looks at an aspirin bottle that Gruber gave him before, sees where it was manufactured, and realizes that there must be the ""bad guys"" where. Can you believe it? You can? Oh no, most of romantic stories don't go that far. Consider Serendipity: girl writes on a book, throws it and if this book somehow finds the man she loves then they must be meant for each other. Now Die Hard : With Vengeance : Simon Gruber gives John McClane a bottle of aspirin that finally causes McClane to find him because in all the places Simon could hide, he chose the address on that bottle.

Because even if Bruce Willis is as good as usual, Samuel L Jackson is terrific, and Jeremy Irons is as good as Alan Rickman was Die Hard 3 is the worst of the three. But don't be scared. Die Hard 3 is a terrific action movie. The fall in this movie is in a few things. One of them is the script. The scripts in the last two movies were SO cool. I mean just the idea of trapping an action hero into a building is genius. And the supersonic snowstorm in nr.2 was so spectacular.

I do like this film and as an action movie it has aged remarkably well. We all know the premise its McLean again getting caught up in the mother of all days. This time we get the addition of Samuel L Jackson as Zeus making it more of a joint effort and a buddy movie. Lets be upfront this is nowhere near as good as the original, but still miles ahead of Die Harder. In Jeremy Irons portrayal of Simon Gruber (brother of Hans) we have a much better adversary than die harder, my only gripe is that there is not enough physical interaction between Gruber and McLean. I also think the film suffers from not being contained in a restricted area, therefore losing the originals sense of claustrophobia. But to the pluses Willis, Jackson and Iron's really deliver by numbers yet excellent performances that lift the movies performances above that of the standard action movie. We have some great if a little over the top set pieces and the payoff we all expect yet want. An action move to be enjoyed over and over again.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Even thought the movie was made almost 20 years ago, due to the dependence on mainly practical effects, it still looks good.The one major downfall of the movie was the ending. It is too bad, since that is what the viewer will remember. It could have been easily re- mediated if they went with a less typical Hollywood-type ending, and that would also have been in line with everything else in the movie.

John Mclane is now a drunk, he's separated from his family, living in New York, and to make matters worse a terrorist calling himself ""Simon"" is out for revenge on Mclane. Mclane, and everyone else, has absolutely no idea why.The first 2 films are superior to this one since this has a lot of changes from the mood that made the others so great. First off, it's not set on Christmas. No biggie though. Secondly, there are too many complications and twists to the plot. You almost have to take notes. And thirdly, the biggest change is that it's now turned into a buddy movie to the style of Lethal Weapon, since Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus unwillingly teams up with John Mclane. They're complete opposites, they argue, and they become friends. That sort of stuff.Die Hard: With A Vengeance still stays true to it's amazing action scenes, though.

Bruce Willis smirks a lot, and Jackson curses a lot. And both ran wildly around, attempting to placate and defeat a mad antagonist. Some of the stunts are truly absurd, such as attempting to get from a tall bridge onto a ship moving below and filled with villains. And Willis is beaten up so badly in the course of this single day (according to the script) that one wonders how he could possibly walk let alone spit out one-liners and beat up bad guys.

So we know John McClane is a crazy cop. Well this time around he's got a buddy in Samuel L Jackson. Samuel L Jackson is an awesome actor for shouting and playing angry people, but what ruins his place in Die Hard 3 is he plays a shopkeeper that ends up assisting Bruce Willis and risking his life, when he has kids and could die, for absolutely NO reason. Now, initially the antagonist of the film made Samuel L Jackson be involved on the threat of a bomb in his neighbourhood. However about halfway through, he could've gone home, but he continues supporting a cop, HE JUST MET, risking his life, when he is a father and a shop keeper. Why would you help the Police when you're just an average electrician, which Samuel L Jackson's character is? Well, obviously you wouldn't. This TOTALLY ruins the movie because it's so stupid, it's like my daughter could write better and she's 6. The film has loads of explosions, an ok performance from Jeremy Irons and it has shapes of excitement. However I loved the original Die Hard, part 2 is pretty good also, but the script on this, the third one, is pathetic. The funniest bit is when Samuel L Jackson is gonna jump from a bridge on to a boat, about 100 feet, for absolutely NO reason. In real life, you'd tell the cop, ""Sir, I'm just an electrician and shop owner, I can't fight people with machine guns"". ""Please get some of your cop buddies or the army to help you.""

He's a current alcoholist, has a depression and has lost his family, but he gets into action once again after being forced as a punishment to stand on the street wearing a sign that includes a racial slur. Unfortunately, a black man named Zeus Carver happens to see this from his store window, but attempts to protect McClane from a gang attack after getting most likely killed by the gang. However, McClane and Carver get into trouble when they hear about Hans Gruber's big brother, Simon and they're trying to stop him before he gets with over 1 million gold ingots.The premise itself makes you wanna watch the film, a Simon Says inspired film, using lots of different themes from the game with multiple bombs and explosions in high-rise buildings and subway tunnels. Samuel L. Jackson was a definate add to the franchise bunch, making multiple complains and praises about him and John McClane with som' great chemistry. Jeremy Irons serving as Simon was also a great add to the bunch.Sadly, the film has multiple flaws: Some rushed scenes, lack of tone from the previous films and a changing pace.Finland Reference: A finnish politican and an actor, Tony Halme plays one of the fake cops who takes the bomb bag from Zeus Carver with his partner.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
187,Newsense,The best of the quadrilogy,10,5 April 2009,"Man, I was watching this movie the other day and I can't believe how good this movie is. Even though I liked Die Harder, it lacked the brains of its predecessor. John McTiernan returned to give us an action flick that not only delivers as an action flick but is also quite effective as a thriller.Simon Peter Gruber(Jeremy Irons) is the brother of Hans Gruber who was killed by McClane in the Nakatomi Plaza. He detonates a few bombs in New York City and sends McClane on ""Fools Errands"" while covering up his real scheme: to steal gold reserves. McClane is saved from an a**kicking by angry mob by Zeus Carver(Samuel L Jackson), a shop owner. They reluctantly team up to play along with Simon's games. They later find out his big scheme all along.Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis have excellent chemistry together. Plus you have to admire the match up. Zeus Carver has a nationalistic mentality and John McClane is your not-so-average white-bread cop. Despite their differences they still get together to handle the same goal. Zeus despite his prejudices was still a factor in helping McClane solve those riddles which were more clever than the riddles that were given to you by Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever.Jeremy Irons is magnificent as Simon Peter Gruber. He's definitely one of the best movie villains in history. His plan showed a clever genius absent from movie villains nowadays. Quite possibly the last serious role that Jeremy Irons had. Tell the truth, can you look at him with a straight face after he starred in Dungeons and Dragons? I think not.I like the pacing of this movie too. It keeps you glued to the screen and provides a thrill ride from start to finish. Im kind of surprised That everybody knows that its better than Die Hard 2. Plus this movie has lowest score of all Die Hard movies on Rottentomatoes. Shows you just how much these snooty consensus followers really know. The fact that this movie was outsold by Batman Forever in the box office shows you exactly where the intelligence of the movie-going was heading. Straight down the toilet bowl and they've been sinking further into the sewer since then.If you're looking for an action/thriller that doesn't disappoint you cant go wrong with Die Hard With A Vengeance. It has great acting, a superb villain, a good plot and some engaging action sequences. More effective than what passes for Thriller these days and is easily the most underrated action sequel of all time.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
188,feyipuk,"Explosions, car chases and a dirty white vest",7,8 February 2014,"If you've seen the previous two Die Hard films - and it would be advisable to - this has the same mix of action, as Officer Mcclane runs round New York trying to stop Jeremy Irons character, Simon Gruber (you might recognise the surname from the Alan Rickmans character in the first film). The main differences between the first two are that: 1) McClane has a partner; Samuel L Jackson, playing an angry, racist (similar role to all his other films, but as a civilian he doesn't get to shoot as much) shop owner, caught up in the plot. 2) McClane isn't just gunning for the bad guys, and has a lot of other challenges to over come first. 3) He's not just confined to a restricted area, like the Nakatomi plaza, or airport, but has the whole of NYC to save. The last two make it feel more like Grand Theft Auto - but you're the cops - compared to the previous two films that felt more like first person shooters. While he didn't need much personal local knowledge for the first two films, it's imperitive for this one; he consulted maps to get around Dulles in the second film, but this time he's on home soil, and it shows.Weirdly, I've seen this at the cinema, on DVD and on TV, and the DVD has a scene cut out - involving some sword action - probably because it's deemed too violent, which was on the cinema and TV release. It doesn't say on the sleeve it was cut, but was likely done to reduce its certificate.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
189,squir1y,Third time's a charm.,10,9 July 2000,"Die Hard with a Vengeance was a great movie and in my opinion was the best of the Die Hard trilogy. Even though the first two were a little more entertaining, this one is the smartest of the three.Bruce Willis is again Lt. John McClane. A few years after he saved Nakatomi Plaza and Dulles Airport, he is back in New York after his marriage crumbled and is suspended from the force. And to make things worse he is about to have one very bad day as a mad bomber named Simon(played brilliantly by Irons)is out for personal revenge on McClane and in the process earn a very large amount of money. This time McClane has back up, an angry fast-talking guy named Zeus(played by Jackson)whose alongside McClane in the wrong place at the wrong time.The key strength in this movie has to be the acting, especially the verbal racial bouts between Willis and Jackson. These are two great actors. Irons brilliantly plays the vengeful villain.Simon says to watch this movie! 10/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
190,andrewmerritt-31652,A great ending to the Die Hard trilogy,8,18 January 2019,"Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third movie in the Die Hard franchise starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, and Jeremy Irons. In this one Brue Willis reprises his role as John McClane who has to stop a mysterious bomber from robbing Fort Knox. The good news is that the writers have ditched the Christmas plot and came up with a brand new idea for the Die Hard series. This would also be the last Die Hard movie until twelve years later we would get Live Free or Die Hard and before then this was a nice way to end the Die Hard Christmas trilogy. This movie doesn't involve Christmas, but it does throw in some Christmas references as a sort of farewell that they are finished with that plot. Because lets be honest having a Die Hard movie-taking place on Christmas is repetitive and also annoying. Accompanying John McClane is Samuel L Jackson who accidently gets dragged into this, as he knows nothing about being a police officer or a detective for that matter. And seeing tis duo on screen is hilarious as it reminds me of a dysfunctional Batman and Robin relationship. Jeremy Irons is the villain of this as he is out for blood after John McClane killed his brother in the first movie. And he acts as the Riddler as he teases them along the way with riddles. And what all this boils down to is that this is what Batman Forever should've been as it has all the elements to make a perfect Batman movie. John McTiernan, who is the director, was a candidate choice for Batman Forever, but he backed out and decided to direct this and I can see why. However, I don't think the movie made the vengeance concept loud enough. The movie is great and the action sequences are terrific however I found that the word vengeance was in the background for the most part. The middle half involves Jeremy Irons and his crew robbing Fort Knox and it isn't until the last five minutes that he decides to get some vengeance that he deserves. And if they combined the two somehow I think they would've had something. Overall, this was a great way to end the Die Hard trilogy as I felt that they wrapped everything up in a beautiful bow.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
191,eamon-hennedy,Cements itself as a fine action series.,10,27 January 2004,"So, you would think as the third film, Bruce getting a little bit older and the supposed ridiculousness of having a third bad day that Die Hard With A Vengeance would be a terrible film, trying aimlessly to do something new with an old hat, that it would struggle. Not at all. Die Hard With A Vengeance is a superb third installment of the franchise and in being so good it cements itself as one of the best film franchises. The story here is excellent, mixing in thrills and spills with the usual plethora of humor that we've come to expect as we watch McClane pit his wits against the brother of Hans Gruber, Simon. A stroke of genius is taking the Die Hard formula and applying it to the buddy cop genre as McClane teams up with Zeus, played fantastically by Samuel L Jackson. The initial hatred that turns to friendship is played out with great humor throughout, from the possible racist hate that they have to their arguing over the tasks Simon sets them (the best being over the women in St Ives and McClanes' curiosity over what they were doing).The plot is more topical that one would expect (the first two becoming more topical as time went on). The bombing plot appears to be ripped from the headlines, but the film is entertainment and as the film goes on we realize that Simon, like his brother, is not a mere terrorist, but an exceptional thief, with the twist being that Simon is after the gold of Fort Knox. McTiernan once again casts an English man in the villain role, with Jeremy Irons playing Alan Rickman's brother. Irons is great, although, like William Sadler in Die Hard 2, Irons is in the shadow of Rickman a tad, but he rises to the challenge enough playing a character of sheer genius and evil.Being made at a time when action movies rely on special/visual effects and explosions, Die Hard With A Vengeance is something unique, somewhat. Yes there are plenty of spectacular action sequences (the train bombing and the Central Park trip being highlights) but McTiernan knows that these films rely on nice character development and humor as well as an entertaining plot to make the film work and that is what we get here. There are some interesting twists to the narrative and the chemistry between Willis and Jackson is great. If the fourth film ever gets made they should bring back Zeus as this could put the franchise into a new gear. The buddy element works fantastically as the bickering and bantering between the two characters makes the film so much fun to watch. I love these films and the third one is terrific. Of course there are many debates over which of the sequels are the best, but I believe that they are both great. The third one ensures that this will remain a classic series and I hope that the fourth one (if it gets made that is) will retain the integrity of this entertaining and fun series.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
192,michaelgarykelley1994,"Very, Very Disappointing",4,5 February 2019,"Just for a little help with understanding where I'm coming from in my taste in this series, so far: I love the first movie, and think it's a relatively modern classic in action films. I couldn't recommend it more to anyone I talk to. The second film sucks in every way it possibly could-especially as a sequel. It's so boring that I dozed a couple of times watching the thing. And then it has a twist that's so dumb and nonsensical that my head spun a little bit. I hate that second movie.Now we've reached the third film in the DH series, called ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"". That's a good title, man. The reputation this film carries around is enormous, and I expected a lot from the same director of the original film. I don't think I overhyped it too much for myself, though. I had heard again and again how this film took the series into a nice blend of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" flicks, and I was all for that, since I'm an enormous fan of all of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies! On top of all of that, my favorite film genre tends to be cop (or crime) thrillers, and this was even more up my alley than the rest of the series! And yet it became a boring movie, too-just like the second film in the franchise! How is that even possible?!The cast is great, all around. Sam Jackson is introduced to this film, as a racist black man, and the chemistry between he and Willis is phenomenal to watch. They really helped the movie not be an entire waste of my time. I really enjoyed them both in this. Again, though: all of the outside actors and actresses were really solid, in my opinion. Our villain is played by Jeremy Irons, which was a huge surprise for me. But his image looks like an absolute joke. I love Irons-the man is a wonderfully talented actor, but this film wastes him severely, I'm sad to say.The scale of this third film is much, much larger than the first two flicks, having John McLane and Sam Jackson running all over the city, for the first half of the film, playing a tense game of ""Simon Says"" that includes bombs being hid all over the city. It was a really great idea, and I was sooooooooo interested in it, for a little less than half of the movie. But then a twist about our villain is revealed, and it's downhill from that point on.The pacing slows down tremendously, and it becomes a chore to sit through. I was getting very agitated with it, as the film progressed. It just felt like we weren't going anywhere actually entertaining or worth making, in the first place. Again: I'm so disappointed in this third film that I don't even know how to put it into words.The directing was mostly great. He took advantage of their locations in the city, and it really made the film feel enormous. It added to the sensation of tension you feel, in the first hour, because of the distances that McLane and Jackson have to go to even simply answer a pay phone. It's worrisome, as a viewer, and makes you panic, a little. There are other really intense scenes surrounding the bombs throughout the city that can have you worried. It's very engaging. But it just doesn't save the film, for me. I could get something close, probably, from a Seagal film, or a Schwarzenegger film, like ""Commando"".The soundtrack and score for ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" is fantastic. Big props to the guy who made that.The action, I'll say, is also very well-done in this boring ass movie, for the most part. It can become a little too common, though, by the third act. Constant explosions and people defying gravity happen, here, and that might drag you out of the movie quite a bit, if you're like me. I don't need Bugs Bunny physics to enjoy a ""Die Hard"" film. The first film never needed that.I have a sneaking suspicion that ""Phonebooth"" took a lot of inspiration from ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"". If you want a better, more tense version of this movie, then watch ""Phonebooth"", instead. You won't regret it.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
193,Mr_PCM,"Cracking action, cracking fun",8,5 March 2006,"Die Hard With A Vengeance is probably the most fun film of the definitive action trilogy of the 80s and 90s. While Die Hard was certainly a gripping adrenaline-fuelled action thriller, and Die Hard 2 stuck closely to that formula, the third film decided that, whilst retaining the action, to cut loose and have fun.The third Die Hard film sees John McLane (Bruce Willis) tearing round New York trying to solve riddles set by the maniacal younger brother of Hans Gruber who he threw off a skyscraper in the first film. Meanwhile the rest of the NYPD are trying to deal with more real threats posed by the terrorist. In these kind of action films, common sense seems to go out of the window in terms of plot rationale anyway, but this time the 'as if' factor is tempered by a great sense of fun.The main source of entertainment however comes not from the plot itself but Samuel L Jackson, who plays a manic fast-talking wisecracking stereotypical black New Yorker named Zeus, with liberal use of the word 'ass' and other more colourful profanities. Jeremy Irons plays this round's bad guy, and plays a slightly more comical version of the first film's Hans Gruber. It seems that British actors have a monopoly on playing the bad guys in American blockbusters, but then again they do seem to do it so well. Meanwhile Bruce Willis faces little challenge in reprising his John McLane action role that, since the first Die Hard film, has become the template for virtually all action heroes, white vest and all.While the action in this film is slightly less explosive than the first two films, the tone is generally much lighter , as if the film has its tongue firmly embedded in its cheek. However the constant wisecracking often threatens to cause the film to descend into self-parody  a problem that has led to many dubbing this film the worst of the trilogy. But with the second film sticking closely to the formula of the first, the injection of freshness was definitely warranted, as if to combat an onset of the franchise being accused of taking itself to seriously. And while this freshness largely comes from Samuel L Jackson's stereotypical black New Yorker (Jeremy Irons villain is merely pantomime hissable) the film came at a time when the stereotype was not so widespread and parodied. Further, there are still plenty of adrenaline-charged action scenes. All in all this made Die Hard With A Vengeance a highly entertaining film. Maybe not the best of the three, but definitely the most fun.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
194,pcrprimer,"Great action movie with fast paced action throughout, but weak ending",8,10 August 2014,"The movie starts off by re-introducing John McClane, and immediately takes off with non-stop action. Samuel L Jackson has great chemistry with Willis, and they really work with each other. Even thought the movie was made almost 20 years ago, due to the dependence on mainly practical effects, it still looks good. The one major downfall of the movie was the ending. It is too bad, since that is what the viewer will remember. It could have been easily re- mediated if they went with a less typical Hollywood-type ending, and that would also have been in line with everything else in the movie. Also, the water riddle was solved way too easily by John, and the editing of it didn't even show how he randomly arrived at the answer.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

The one thing I liked about this film was the chemistry between Willis and Jackson.  They work extremely well together and make a good duo.  I hope they are reunited for the fourth entry in the series.

197,RestlessRust,Almost good,5,22 January 2001,"I heard someone say Die Hard ""blew up the mold!""  True enough.  Die Hard 2 was so highly anticipated that the theaters actually started showing it a day or two (can't remember) early.  To me, that one lived up to its predecessor's legacy.  It maintained the claustrophobic feel while mixing up the formula.  (And that airplane crash scene gave me chills!)Die Hard with a Vengeance completely abandons the claustrophobia that made the DH films unique.  Instead of a hero with geographical limitations, we get a hero with chronological limitations.  (Most of his Herculean labors must be accomplished within a certain time frame or something bad will happen.)  So what's different about that?  At least half the thrillers of all time involve some sort of time limit.  So in abandoning its heritage, DH3 loses its identity.Despite that, DH3 almost succeeds in creating a new identity of its own.  In a rarity for action thrillers, we actually watch each heroic effort wondering if John McClane will succeed, as he doesn't succeed every time. However, the movie abruptly stops these challenges about halfway through, and the rest of the movie is just generic, stunt-filled cat-and-mouse fare.The other level on which this movie fails is in showing us bleak futures for characters we love.  The McClanes were having marital difficulty in the first movie, but they got back together, and John changed as a result of his experiences in that office building.  Now, John is virtually psychotic since his wife left him.  What happened?  For that alone I wish I hadn't seen this movie.  The last time I saw them they were happy if a bit cursed when Christmas rolled around.So, what's the score now?  Three severe blows to the head?  That's more than enough since the movie never actually recovers from the first one.  It's a shame, too.  All through this movie you can see the wasted potential.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

It doesn't have completely over-the-top action sequences that seem out of place even in a tongue-in-cheek film. Jeremy Irons plays a wonderful villain that rivals even the performance by Alan Rickman in the first film. It's a truly thrilling, quite creepy at times, edge-of-the-seat film. The best thing in the whole thing though is the relationship between the characters of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, who are both brilliant together. I enjoyed the sub-plot between them and the racial tension that was there simply because of Jackson's character's paranoia.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
199,Exiled_Universe,BEST DIE HARD MOVIE OUT OF THE FIRST 3!!!!!,8,1 July 2019,"This movie was the best die hard movie out of the first 3. This one wasn't really action persay, but it was more of a hardcore adventure film and i was literally glued to the screen the whole time. Something about this one was different whether it was the characters and cast, the acting, or just the story. The story in this one was so complex and unique which is something that is kind of hard to find. I really enjoyed this movie and it was so neat and cool. Samuel L. Jackson was a cool person to but in the movie but he looked kind of nerdy. All the riddles they have to solve before the bombs blow up sounds kind of dumb, but if you think about it its actually brilliant. My favorite part was the whole subway scene when the train exploded of the part in the beginning when John walk with a racial sign attached to him. In the first few seconds there is a bomb that goes off!!!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
200,Wulfstan10,This breathed life back into the series.,7,25 March 2005,"After Die Hard 2, I didn't expect much from this film, but it really was a major improvement. While not quite as fresh, slick, or tense as the original, this one did the job well. The plot, unlike Die Hard 2, is again pretty original, with a significant, convincing, and meaningful twist to it, and generally the film succeeds at building tension, keeping the excitement going, etc. By tying the film into Hans Gruber from the first film, it not only mostly reconnects to the original's unique qualities, but provides further meaning and relevance to this film. It is thus a logical progression from the first rather than simply being a film about the same character doing similar things in what could otherwise be a totally different film. Also, with Samuel L. Jakcson and Jeremy Irons, there is more good acting along the lines of Rickman's role in the original.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
201,TimBoHannon,"Bad acting, bad writing, a horrid ending, and Hollywood Bait and Switch",3,13 October 2003,"There is a nice little idea for a thriller wrapped up in the first thirty-five minutes of the third Die Hard film. Too bad it only lasts that long.A beautiful, peaceful morning in the Big Apple is suddenly disturbed by a bombing at a department store. Barely do the police have time to gain their bearings when a call comes in from a man called Simon (Jeremy Irons). He wants to play a game of Simon Says with our beloved hero John McClane. Non-compliance will result in a ""penalty""--another bomb going off somewhere in the city.His first stop is Harlem, where must wear a sandwich sign bearing a racist slogan never seen in Harlem. When his life is saved by a man named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), Simon says that he too must run all over town solving his deadly puzzles.""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" was promoted with the premise I just described, only it turns out to be the Hollywood equivalent of bait and switch. After a mere three puzzles, the focus shifts to a far inferior plot and deconstructs all the tension that has been built in the movie's first third.Following the explosion of one of his bombs in a Wall Street subway station, Simon threatens to destroy a school. The bomb will respond if the police use their radios, so the ever intelligent police chief floods all police traffic through 911, and sends out the entire police force to search schools for the bomb. In other words, there could be a full-blown gunfight and the cops would never know about it.While the police run around like chickens with their heads cut off, Simon, who has about a hundred men at his disposal, begins to rob several billion dollars from a federal bank. This is all detailed in an overlong and uninteresting section played to the tune of ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home.""Unfortunately, the use of car sales tactics is not the film's worst problem; it is the characters, most specifically, the character of John McClane. In the first film, he worked for the New York Police Department and was trying to got transferred to the LAPD as soon as he could. In the second film, he was LAPD and any marital problems from the first film appeared to be water under the bridge. Now, he is a once again a New York cop, his wife lives on the opposite coast, and he is one step away from a life steeped in alcoholism. In other words, all the time we spent rooting for John and Holly to overcome their marital problems was wasted. I am of the opinion that if Hollywood studios cannot find a consistent, positive way to treat their characters from one film to the next, then they have no business making a sequel (see ""Speed 2"").Samuel L. Jackson is probably one of the best actors in Hollywood right now, but the limitations of the material are evident. It is awfully difficult to care for Zeus because of his heavy racism (do not let his heroic actions in Harlem fool you, he had an ulterior motive). Likable or not, he easily outshines the rest of the cast, especially Willis, who benefits from several one-liners that are funny on paper, but delivered in a way that robs them of all comic appeal. One question: If Zeus is such a smart mathematician, then why is his vocabulary so limited?Jeremy Irons is well below average as the villain. He starts out in convincing fashion when only his voice is present, though the dark tone he used to voice Scar in ""Lion King"" is curiously missing. Once we see his face, the character loses all impact. It is shame that Simon was not treated more like Kiefer Sutherland's baddie in ""Phone Booth,"" who, if you remember, was not seen until the end. Of course, this would have meant sticking to the main premise of the film, apparently a task too large for the makers.Speaking of the end, ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" is devoid of excitement for the last half hour. I will not discuss the final scene except to say that it is not usually a good sign when a film forgets about seventy some characters it makes a point of showing on camera. Oh, and I still have not figured out how the trucks got past the border.Plot holes like this can be overcome with good acting but was there any to speak of? A tiny bit. Aside from Kevin Chamberlin's rarely seen bomb expert, the film's best acting comes from Alan Rickman, the bad guy from the FIRST ""Die Hard.""

203,pootc,"Think fast, look alive and Yippee-Kay-Yay!",9,8 July 2007,"Die Hard with a Vengeance starts out with a bang and never lets up. Its a fantastic, original and suspenseful action thriller pitting a suspended and very hung-over Detective John McLane with marital issues against an elusive enemy calling himself Simon. McClane is about to have a very bad day and Simon wants McClane to play a game, 'Simon Says' or he is going to set off another bomb in a very public place. Racing through New York City, leaping onto subway trains, dodging gunfire, and jumping through hoops for a psychopath McCLane unwittingly picks up Zeus Carver, a racist shop-owner played masterfully by Samuel L Jackson who is drawn into the action.Vengeance in essence is a direct sequel to the first Die Hard only totally different. Its not Christmas, and its not confined to a building but John McTiernan is back to direct and its like he never left because the grit, intensity, and attitude of the original Die Hard is ever present and though Hans Gruber is long dead Jeremy Irons does more than enough to carry the weight of a worthy advisory to McClane whose one step shy of becoming a full-blown alcoholic. The quips are there, the one-liners, the German bad guys, the foul language and non-stop action.The supporting cast and many extras of Vengeance are also great. Vengeance is an ode to New York and there are long periods without any McClane, Jackson or Irons which only serve to make the movie stronger and setup the explosive finale. But the real winner here is truly the banter and chemistry between the two leads and the sidekick formula completely works here and is a welcome break from the McClane being alone in a confined place scenario. Overall this is my favourite rendition of John McClane who hasn't missed a beat and it's a great performance from Bruce Willis in a role he knows so well. The ending doesn't quite live up to the rest of the movie but there's enough here to warrant a true classic in my opinion as Vengeance's re-watch value is very high.

204,rcraig62,Die Bored,3,1 August 2004,"The biggest problem with movies that run in a series (the Pink Panthers, the Lethal Weapons, etc.) is that the longer they go on, the more insane they get; they almost lose touch with the characterizations and subtleties that made them great and rely heavily on big boffo gags and fraudulent action. Die Hard 3 is the sorriest example of this malaise.The people who made Die Hard 3 don't understand the difference between ""over the top"" and ""stupid"". Over the top entertainment may be extreme, but it's within a realm of possibility, and the audience needs only to suspend disbelief to accept it. Stupid is stupid and it's an insult to the audiences' intelligence, except, I guess, for the action-picture dummies who don't care and can't tell. Explain me this: Why does Sam Jackson, who is playing a black racist, offer Bruce Willis shelter in his shop so he won't get beat up by the homies after he turns up wearing a sandwich board that says ""I Hate Niggers""? Or why does the NYPD, which can't even respond to a legit threatening phone call because it wades through so many fakers, spring into action when some guy doing a Peter O'Toole imitation intones ""Simple Simon met a pieman...."" The movie will suck in the Die Hard die-hards, but without the goodwill of the first two pictures to support it, it fails on so many levels. Jackson's character, which is only there because the filmmakers So Obviously want to create a Lethal Weapon-esque buddy-buddy thing, is just an annoying complainer. It's written poorly and acted poorly. Jackson's racist isn't aggrieved, he's miffed. And in the whole movie, there is not one quotable line of dialogue (a la ""hasta la vista, baby""), which everyone knows the filmmakers want; they have the right actor in Willis to deliver a wisecrack, and they still can't come up with anything. Even the action isn't great: one bit that has potential for greatness is when a subway train is blown right out of its hole and jumps up on the platform. The scene is edited so badly, one second we see debris flying and people running scared, the next, it's all over and we don't see the consequences, except for Bruce Willis emerging with a wrenched back and a bloody nose. But isn't that the whole point of the film- that civilians are in danger from this psychotic madman? If the film cuts that, then why not just cut the whole thing?There is nothing particularly memorable about Die Hard 3, it's just one long cliché (oh, and don't forget the old tin snip to break out of handcuffs). The only thing I liked was a scene where Bruce Willis steals some little kid's bike in the name of official police business, a great cliché-buster if ever there was one. But the Die Hards are not in the same class with the Lethal Weapons, action-wise or dialogue-wise. They're very dreary and menacing and generally only good for killing time, about the only thing that does die hard. It's a tough sit. 1 1/2 * out of 4",Die Hard with a Vengeance

They definitely have tried their best to be innovative here by moving away from the basics which sadly I felt was a mistake as this makes the die hard movie pretty much just another action movie and takes away the formula that sets it apart from many other action types. I would say that this movie is a little bit fun and I do definitely enjoy the interaction between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.

The cops grab McClane, who is by now a heavy drinker, and put him on the phone with Simon. Simon makes him walk through Harlem with a very offensive sign. Just when he is about to get beat down, he is rescued by the racist Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus. It seems as though Simon wants revenge on McClane for something, but nobody knows why. Now, Zeus and McClane are at the mercy of Simon, who meanwhile is committing a massive robbery.This movie is considerably different from the other two, which is probably a good thing. Who wants the same thing three times in a row? The plot has as many twists and turns as a snake, and the movie keeps the viewer involved. Watching Zeus and McClane bicker is amusing as well. Samuel L. Jackson pulls off the role of the ""racist black man"" very well. I would highly recommend this movie.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
208,Troy2Slick,Die Hard: With a mighty comeback,10,4 May 2003,"After 5 years from Die Hard part 2, which didn't do as good as the first, Willis makes a strong comeback the 2nd best movie in the trilogy. I didn't care too much for the second one, but the first and third are action classics, if you can classify any action flicks as classic. Die Hard: With a Vengeance stars Bruce Willis (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense), Samuel Jackson (Pulp Fiction, The Negotiator) and Jeremy Irons (Dungeons & Dragons, The Time Machine) in this epic action flick of the decade. If you are looking for some of the best action of the 1990's, then look no further. This movie has what you crave for. Explosions, guns, car chases, jumps from bridges, helicopters, even a scene in the mean streets of Harlem, in which Bruce Willis is forced to wear a picket sign with suggestive material written on it. Bruce and Samuel Jackson have the greatest chemistry together and make this film work and fit together like a puzzle. It has plenty of spills, thrills, laughs, action, wit, great acting, what more could one ask for? I highly recommend this movie. 4 *'s out of 4 *'s for the action scenes alone.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
209,GluStick,A great third.,10,7 July 1999,"This is yet another great installment in the great Die Hard movies. It has Bruce Willis running around New York with a partner who has a problem with white people trying to get him killed. There is great action sequences including a bomb in a train. It's another roller-coaster ride for Bruce's character John McClane and us as well. The plot is a little dumb at times but from a third action movie that's good anyway, you really don't notice. The acting was also good. Jeremy Irons is a really good bad guy but not as good as Alan Rickman. Most of the time, Bruce and Sam just cuss at each other but it was nice to see Bruce paired up with someone with even more attitude than him. It's a really good movie but the violence and language are not really for kids. Die Hard: With a Vengeance: B",Die Hard with a Vengeance
210,Rinho18,My number 141 movie ( contains story + spoilers ),9,7 February 2001,"""Die Hard : with a vengeance"" is my number 141 movie. ( outta 750 about )It is a good action film, and Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and especially Jeremy Irons do a well action job.The story : Simon ( Jeremy Irons ) is the brother of the guy , that John McClane ( Bruce Willis ) has killed in ""Die Hard 1"" ( the one that felt down the skyscraper ). He wants to take revenge for the loss of his brother. He places a bomb in an underground station in Manhattan. This bomb explodes. Simon has a racist orders for John McClane ( you know what I mean if you have seen the film ). During the carrying out of the orders John McClane gets an accomplice named Zeus ( Samuel L. Jackson ). Simon has a lot of more orders for them, which they carry out. But they do not have that much time to think where Simon could be ( he seems to be everywhere ). But in the end they get Simon during a ceremony with his accomplices...I have to admit that I like ""big"" action films, and ""Die Hard 3"" is better than part 2, but a bit worse than part 1, I think. I consider it a good action film, but there are many action films that are ( much ) better.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and I recommend it to actions fans and to guys that do not expect a film that is almost as good ( or even better ) than part 1.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
211,Haplo-4,Total failure,7,30 March 1999,"Ohh what is this? Movie 1 was a success, movie 2 even better, but this one - what a mistake. This movie has nothing compared with the first two. Bruce Willis is still acting as one might foresee but his character has lost most of the things that made him interesting. He is not as swift-mouthed as in the first movies and a lot of his irony is missing. Jackson only does a half-hearted job as a black-racist who is forced to work with a white-guy. But Irons is perfect - he looks as made of stone and his voice is excellent for a psycho. The only thing good about this movie is the well coordinated action that manage to beat most of the others action-movies, but that still doesn't makeup for its losses.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

That is until Simon plays his game.Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase.Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close.McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great.Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane.Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather.I give this 10 stars out of 10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
213,CWP-,"A fantastic addition to the ""Die Hard"" series",8,17 July 1999,"My Age: 13A department store, Bonwit Teller, was blown up in New York.  Soon after, the police receive a phone-call from a man named Simon, who wants John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, to do everything he says or more bombs will go off around the city.  In John's first escapade, his life is saved by a black man named Zeus Carver, played by Samuel L. Jackson.  Zeus is then forced by the madman to participate in his little games.  What does it have to do with John?  Simon has a vendetta against McClane, a score he would like to settle, but John soon finds out that the entire plot isn't just about revenge.Even though I find this to be a great movie, it is not as good as the first two and the only thing it has in common with them is McClane.  It abandons a few things that are in both of the first two, including Al Powell, Richard Thornburg, Holly McClane, and the entire lone hero idea, this one opting for two heroes.  That aside, it is still a great film and I like how each of the films are set in different cities.  The first half of this film is absolutely fantastic.  After Simon shows his face, it is still very good, but not quite as good.  The action throughout is fantastic and the premise sets up some good bomb-defusing scenes.

215,plpregent,Nothing less than a classic among action films,8,23 December 2015,"John McTiernan returns for this third opus in John McClane's adventures. It's a beautiful, sunny day in New York city, when a bomb suddenly explodes. Chaos ensues and the man responsible for the attack wastes no time contacting the NYPD. What does he want? None other than John McClane, the former cop who acted as a one man army in handling a difficult hostage situation at the Nakatomi Plaza and prevented a bunch of planes from crashing in Washington. Suspended from his functions, and now a drunk with a terrible hangover, McClane will have to accomplish different tasks throughout the day to prevent other bombs from exploding while the man who apparently placed the bombs instructs him what he has to do next.This third film from the Die Hard franchise is arguably my personal favourite (a tie with the first one). The action is relentless, the dialogue is sharp and hilarious, the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson is palpable, a proper amount of dark humour is cleverly used to lighten up the tone and even bring social commentary on racial tensions without ever being sanctimonious. There are plenty of over-the-top moments, and the realism of the script's chronology is definitely questionable. However, it's all honest entertainment, set in the beautiful NYC that you really get to see and feel, thanks to John MacTiernan's talent at establishing geography in his scenes, and the events depicted in the film all happen within the same day, which, to me, is one of the key elements that make the Die Hard films so great, and feel like such a rush of adrenaline.Bruce Willis offers a great physical performance, and you can bet the house his character is drenched in blood, sweat and oil by the time the credits roll. Samuel L. Jackson is a great addition as John McClane's ally and turns this into a memorable cop buddy movie more than anything else. Jeremy Irons is excellent as the antagonist. The ending is a bit flawed and feels like it was a tad rushed, but the overall spectacle is so much fun and entertainment, you can't do anything but kick back, relax, and enjoy the show.Die Hard With a Vengeance is a clever mix of nail-biting situations (the scene when McClane has to walk in Harlem wearing nothing but a sign with a racial slur written on it comes to mind), classic 90's type action (the scene in the subway), and comedy (one scene in which ""Johnny comes marching home"" will get you smiling), all wrapped up in a competently photographed, dynamically directed, tremendously paced package.Highly recommended. It ties with the first film as my favourite entry in the Die Hard franchise.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

218,anthonymichaelbangert,The Franchise Died Hard with a Vengeace After this One,8,24 August 2015,"Die Hard with a Vengeance: The third film in the franchise, the last good one in the franchise. Had the series ended here Die Hard would have went out on a high. As it happens, that's not what happened unfortunately. In this film John McClane is called back onto the force after being suspended (for some unknown reason) when a bombing occurs in New York City by a man named Simon. Simon plays a dangerous game of Simon Says with John and a black stranger with a vendetta on whites (who John comes in contact with in the first round of Simon Says in a hilariously terrible situation). Together they race around the city trying to stop bombs from being set off by playing along with the rules. They soon learn that Simon is the brother of Hans Gruber, the man John killed back in the original Die Hard. Soon after, John learns of Simon's real plan to rob the Federal Reserve, and works with his sidekick to stop him. This movie is a fast paced action, and never lets that up. Each scene is crafted to bring on the excitement, as it suspends you in fear as well. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson make a great team. They work well off each others energy, and you see growth out of each of them throughout the film. This movie does have weak points, mainly being that the movie does play off the action movie clichés. Cheesy one liners, bad guys that cant aim if their target is 2 feet away from them, explosions galore, impossible escapes, and more. But the film is so much fun that you can forgive it for these details, and actually just appreciate them as good fun. A great movie that should have ended Die Hard on a high, this is one to see when you just want a great action film.8/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
219,Ryan_9,Another solid film in the Die Hard franchise!,8,11 February 2021,"""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" was great and another solid film in the Die Hard franchise. It delivered well, but I'd say it was the weakest out of the three, in my opinion. I still liked it but would say ""Die Hard 2"" was the better sequel. However, nothing beats the first one.Bruce Willis did an awesome job and was on point once again as John McClane. Samuel L. Jackson (Zeus Carver) was an excellent addition to the cast as I really liked Zeus and thought he was a good character. He provided some comedic relief too. It was nice to see McClane have legit help this time instead of going at it alone. Willis and Jackson played off each other well and had great chemistry. Jeremy Irons (Simon Gruber) was perfectly cast as this was another example of Die Hard giving us likable villains. Simon might not have been on Hans Gruber's level but was charismatic for sure and well-spoken. The accent was also a nice touch.The action and suspense were great for the most part. Some of my favorites were the elevator scene, the car chase, and when McClane had to escape from the flood. I liked the riddles they had to solve too. The only real downside of this film was the ending. I found it to be weak and not as strong compared to the first two. I thought they could've written Simon's death better and made the final battle more intense. However, McClane's line ""say hello to your brother"" was pretty badass.Overall, I'll give ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" an 8/10. Another solid Die Hard film!",Die Hard with a Vengeance

If you liked the first instalment you won't be disappointed.Explosion, mind games, furious gun battles. anything missing? It's hard to make a great action film carry on for after 2 great series. (even though Die Hard2 wasn't so good) But this third sequel surly come's back with a BANG! It's just as good as the first. The action is unlimited and fast, you got your normal gun battles and explosion (as you would expect from a typical Die Hard film.) The action scene's are very direct. However the plot stood out the most. ""John McClane and a store owner must play a bomber's deadly game as they race around New York while trying to stop him"" It's nothing standing out when you read it. Yes the plot is simple but more interesting and a whole lot more fun. You can automatically assume that your in for a fun action ride when hearing the plot. Playing a deadly game with a bomber, and who else could play the game better then your pain in the arse, Jhon Mclane! Again acting off coarse as you would expect was brilliant, Bruce Willis just doesn't disappoint. But this time you got an extra treat he's along side the man himself Samuel L. Jackson. A pleasure to watch them too together, they also deliver many laughs.All in all a great fun action flick, a good one to watch in any occasion. Full with action and laughs.

John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself back in New York he is now an alcoholic loser, separated from his wife, and suspended from the police force. until a serial bomber (Jeremy Irons) begins terrorizing the city. Soon McClane is sent on tedious suicide errands alongside a Harlem shopkeeper (Samuel L. Jackson) as a distraction while Jeremy Irons and his brigade rob the gold from the Federal Reserve. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson had great chemistry, they've worked together in a couple films, but i found this to be the best. I liked how even many of the minor characters have lively, memorable personalities. It reminded me of the first Beverly Hills Cop where a wide variety of characters stood out.

222,neobateman,The best Die Hard sequel,9,5 April 2017,"Die Hard 3 changes things up again to feel more fresh once again. The producers knew that they couldn't continue putting John McClane in these confined areas making him kill random terrorists. This time McClane will be moving around an entire city solving riddles together with a partner. Zeus played by Samuel L. Jackson. The film was once again directed by John McTiernan. I believe this was a good choice as he was the one who directed the first one and he would know how to build on it. In New York a terrorist who calls himself Simon threatens to blow up random areas in New York City if John McClane failed to solve his riddles. So the recently suspended John McClane (Bruce Willis) is put back on duty. First of the increase of the scale this time really works. John McClane this time doesn't crawl through shafts but instead drives taxis through Central Park. He is once again challenged and the plot makes sense too as the film actually builds on the first film. It is a sequel that doesn't feel rehashed and tired, the story once again is totally engaging. The action sequences are gritty and entertaining, John McClane is at his roughest here. I really liked Bruce Willis in this movie, his chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson really blossomed. Whilst I don't think it is as good as the original as the ending feels a bit tacked on, no spoilers but I think the last 15-20 minutes really feels added on simply to bring more closure. But overall this is the best 'Die Hard' sequel, it builds on the original, keeps some of the tropes the same. But also has growing characters and an interesting story with terrific action. This absolutely is a very underrated action movie, I highly recommend it.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

This sees the city of New York as the battleground for John McClane, who finds himself targeted for revenge by a terrorist, and gaining help from Harlem storekeeper Zeus - Samuel L Jackson, who proves to be a terrific companion to John.The film gets off to a good start, with the pace rarely stopping to take a breath. At about the midway point, we see the true intentions of the main villain - a plot that smacks more than a bit of Goldfinger. When John realises the whole bomb plot by 'Simon' - Jeremy Irons - was actually to decoy police away from his intended target, it becomes a race against time to hunt him down.Where the film loses points a little is the somewhat weak finale, nowhere near as good as the climaxes for either the first two, though it should be noted the original intended ending was just plain bad.Until it stumbles at the end, another great ride for John McClane",Die Hard with a Vengeance

In the first two films, the driving force behind the McClane character was his love for his wife. Granted, McClane was separated in the first film. Yet he truly loved her. In this film, he had been separated for a year and had a rather callous attitude... not his character. This ruined the entire film for me. I'm a big Samuel L. Jackson fan and he was great (as usual).

Teaming up with John is Zeus, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who helps give the film a more edgy buddy-cop feeling. Jackson does a fantastic job in his role and the chemistry between him and Willis is dynamite. The bad guy isn't too great, though he was definitely evil.What really stands out here is the humor.

Having enjoyed immensely the original and being very disappointed by the second, I was hoping for some form of middle ground from this one. Yet again, we have the same tired mix of ingredients mixed with fertilizer - An attempt to make things bigger and more impressive but whose net effect was to make this film stink. Samuel Jackson is reasonably good - but then he is a good actor, even with this material. Bruce's character, however has become a joke. Speaking of good actors, we also have Jeremy Irons doing the British-actor-playing-a-nasty-foreigner role. But that accent was so atrocious the dialect coach should be tarred and feathered. It travelled so much and so often it must have racked up air miles. The plot was complete and utter drivel and the action unable to suspend such a level of disbelief.

231,fidelio74,Die Hard: With a Pungence,6,10 January 2011,"I was pretty disappointed when I first saw 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance'. From the opening frame, warning bells sounded: no '20th Century Fox' logo. Not a good sign considering that said studio was behind the film. As I watched the film, I was unmoved by some pretty dodgy special visual effects (the huge torrent of water which sweeps up reluctant - and hungover! - hero Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), and the rather underwhelming explosion which destroys the cargo ship near the film's end). On the whole, I felt that the whole affair was a letdown, especially considering the raised expectations cued by the fact that this installment marked 'Die Hard' director John McTiernan's most welcome return to the franchise.Now it seems that every time I see the movie I enjoy it more and more. It is the final splatter film in the series; 'Die Hard 4.0' was the first flick in the series to be awarded a PG-13 rating. 'Vengeance' is, like its two predecessors, R-rated, and contains some pretty shocking violence: a close-quarters shootout in an elevator yields a great deal of bloodshed, and later a henchman is cut in half by a cable.Once again we have a memorable and charismatic villain in Simon Gruber (British actor Jeremy Irons). While Irons - an extremely talented actor - can not better fellow Brit Alan Rickman's bad guy, Hans Gruber, from the first 'Die Hard', he still delivers a solid and engaging performance, always keeping his cool despite being constantly thwarted by McClane. His sultry and silent partner, Katya, is played by former Contemporary Christian Music singer Sam Phillips. The fact that she does not speak throughout the entire film is a very clever conceit, and she is able to say a great deal with just a glance. But Katya is not just along for the ride, something she demonstrates by dispatching - in a very bloody and graphic display - several security guards.'Die Hard: With a Vengeance' is lean and mean and very entertaining. The film opens explosively... quite literally! We see various shots of New York as The Lovin' Spoonful's 'Summer in the City' pounds on the soundtrack. Suddenly, a bomb explodes at the Bonwit Teller department store, shattering the hustle and bustle of a typical morning in the Big Apple.Responsibility for the bombing is taken by a man who calls the New York Police Department and identifies himself only as 'Simon'. He wishes to play a game with McClane whom, we discover, is on suspension. 'Simon' is insistent: if McClane does not participate in this 'game', then 'Simon' will detonate another bomb in another part of the city. Our first sight of McClane is very telling: he is hungover and half-asleep, and dosing himself up on coffee and aspirin. This is no muscle-bound Schwarzenegger-type hero out to save the day and kill the bad guys: McClane would clearly rather be in bed, catching up on much-needed sleep. This makes him all the more human, and his particularly nasty hangover becomes something of a comic motif as the action-packed events of the day unfold. He is the ultimate reluctant hero: jaded, cynical, and very profane. He would much rather someone else save the world on this occasion. The problem is, 'Simon' is calling for him, and no one else.McClane's first task is as bizarre as it is dangerous: he has to strip down to his boxer shorts ('You're the first person since Holly to see me do this,' he tells cop Connie Kowalski (Colleen Camp). 'I'm honoured,' she replies with a distinct lack of enthusiasm) and walk through Harlem, wearing a sandwich board bearing a racially inflammatory declaration. An electronic goods store proprietor, Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) happens to notice McClane and, fearing an imminent homicide, takes pity upon him and rescues him from certain death when McClane is set upon by a group of young men who have taken the greatest possible exception to the sign he is wearing.What follows is more of these deadly 'games' and riddles which McClane and Carver must solve in order to prevent further bombs being detonated in their city. Like McClane, Carver is a reluctant hero who is caught up in the mayhem. He would much rather leave McClane to his own devices but he feels an obligation to help if he can.Three very strong action set pieces spring to mind: in the first, McClane commandeers one of those ubiquitous yellow cabs and tears through Central Park while joggers, picnickers, and mime artists(!) leap for desperately for cover. The second serves up a spectacular subway crash which recalls those in 'Speed' and 'Money Train'. The third involves two helicopters and closes the film with a very satisfying amount of pyro.Speaking of the film's ending... The Definitive Edition DVD release offers a very classy alternative ending in which McClane tracks Simon down to a swank gentlemen's club. Seating himself opposite Simon, McClane places a specially designed rocket launcher upon the table and begins to spin it slowly around and around as Simon tries to figure out which end of the weapon is the dangerous one. McClane then gives Simon a taste of his own medicine, reeling off riddle after riddle before solving the rocket launcher puzzle in a very clever way. Not as spectacular as the theatrical ending but interesting nonetheless.McTiernan has not built a better 'Die Hard' the second time around. But 'Vengeance' is full of action and some great lines and certainly earns its rightful place in the series. It is refreshing that the script does something a little different and takes risks. They pay off.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

I really enjoyed this movie simply because it was exciting without having to ""Cut the red wire / Cut the green wire"".Bruce's acting is good for a change, and it seems to enhance this movie, rather than the usual was that Stallone etc. bring down the quality of the movies they are in.10 out of 10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Love the Simon says premise, which is a great way for our characters to be moved around NYC, sometimes engaged in heroics other times made to look foolish.

239,jwiley-86292,Spends time on the wrong elements,6,26 October 2016,"I wanted to like this more. I really did. The concept is brilliant, perfect to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. As someone who knows the place, I commend the gorgeous, immersive filming of New York--even though it's from more than twenty years ago, the film looks like how the city really feels. This sets the film apart from other Hollywood depictions of New York. Most of all, Jeremy Irons' character is a worthy successor to his brother, exuding. . . let's just say he's hot and leave it at that.Sadly, the elements I liked made the sagging elements all the harder to swallow. Most conspicuously, With a Vengeance sorely lacks the scintillating dialogue of the first movie, which was a huge part of why I love it. The first third had me totally attentive, but around the middle it derails and takes too long to wrap up. And yet, the end still feels very abrupt. I would not have killed Simon with such merciless speed. Hollywood, why are your bad guys so often more lovable than your good guys? I wished the film had taken the time to explain more about Simon's background. He was in the East German Stasi or something, and felt miffed when East Germany, therefore his job, ceased to exist. That's interesting! Tell us more! And why was Hans in the West in the 80s when there were still two Germanies? With a Vengeance could have explained that, too. For that matter, who is Katya and what is her relationship with Simon like?The first Die Hard was such a delight to me because it defied my preconception that action movies were just fighting and explosions with no catharsis or character drama. This one is tipped, albeit slightly, towards the latter category.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Unfortunately Die Harder seemed to have lost the magic of seeing John McClane on screen. Thankfully Die Hard: With a Vengeance showed us once again what it means to make a great action movie franchise though.Sure, the formula changed, McClane is no longer confined to one building. This time he also has a less than competent sidekick too. This just adds to the charm, and once you throw in another Gruber you know you're in for a wild ride.Unfortunately the Die Hard franchise is one of those where you need to sift through the chaff to find the wheat. WIth a Vengeance is definitely great quality though, and shows us how a great sequel should be made.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
242,samuraifa451,Way better than the prior sequel!,8,3 December 2007,"I loved the first Die Hard and though I thought the first sequel wasn't as good as the original, I still enjoyed it. Five years later, Bruce Willis returns again as our hero John McClane for yet another battle with terrorists in Die Hard With A Vengeance and I for one am grateful for the return. This time, McClane squares off against the brother of Hans Gruber from the original, Simon, and Simon is not too pleased with how things ended in the original. McClane is forced to cooperate along with Zeus (played by Samuel L. Jackson) to stop Simon's heist. The action never stops and ""Yippie-ki-yay"" never sounded better.

It's like the Jaws and Rocky series...nothing should have been made after the first one. You know it's bad when it's difficult to come up with 10 lines to try and create this review.

245,bitomurder,An unlucky day...threepeat,9,11 April 2018,"In 1995, Bruce Willis once again joined forces with director John McTiernan to give us the third adventure in the unlucky life of Detective John McClane. This time, John McClane is apparently the source of the terrorism and he is forced to play a game piece in a sick set of twisted puzzles created for what seems to be little more than punishing him for killing our new protagonist's brother Hans Gruber. However, not all is as it seems and the director and co. give us a few surprises along the way. The third installment in the widely popular series gave us what the second one should have, a sequel that was bigger than the first one while bringing some originality to the series. This one does not rehash the same tired story with ol' Johnny stuck in an impossible situation trying to survive and hopefully come out on top. The simple idea was to take an impossible situation and instead of putting our hero into the mix we get to see that he IS the situation. His actions from the first movie have come back to revisit him tenfold. It makes this one a memorable and freshly inventive addition to a series that could not survive another old and tired sequel. With John McClane returning as our only original character, we get to see a new and different guy. A guy who has lost his wife and children and really has little to get up for than to drink himself to death day after day. He is no longing that happy and upbeat guy we seen in our first two adventures. This lends a freshness to the whole thing while making you realize that, despite having nothing to live for, he still does his best to save the day. Joining John is a new and unwitting adventurer Zeus, played by the great and iconic Samuel L. Jackson. Samuel gives us another entertaining character to cheer for and he does an amazing job injecting a renewed energy to our hero's story. The two of them together almost make this one feel like a good buddy movie with shades of Lethal Weapon. Jeremy Irons as Hans Gruber's brother Simon is another reason this is the sequel that should have been made five years earlier. He does a splendid job. So to put it simply, this is the sequel we all wanted to see. It is a fun and inventive story that comes close to what the original did. It is bigger, but not better. However, I do not think you could come much closer to the first Die Hard than this one did. It is easily the second best in the series.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
246,votesmall,Better than the first one? No. Just... no.,6,4 November 2012,"The blazing suspense of Die Hard is to this day nearly unmatched by any other action movie. I think that it's the best action movie ever made. In the sequel, McClane fights off terrorists that have taken over an airport. The very next day, I rented it. And... it wasn't as good. Maybe that's because it was more of a psychological form of suspense with a race-against-the-clock feel, which is what the original did not rely on. Despite its flaws and not as good of pace as the original classic, it was still a great sequel with a great premise. And then when my dad said that DIE HARD 3 was probably the best, I had to see it. It took me a while, but I finally got around to seeing it, and I... didn't love it! DIE HARD 3 is seriously overrated. I came into it with gigantic expectations, and I came out slightly disgruntled. Let me explain why. DIE HARD 3 features a hungover John McClane, who is called by a mysterious bomber named ""Simon"" who tells him that he will use liquid binary explosives to blow up various locations around the city of New York, and if he doesn't want that to happen, then he'll have to play his twisted version of the game ""Simon Says"". This is ingenious, but I feel that they did not focus enough on the games, instead focusing on what the games were created for.John is forced to do various humiliating, difficult, and strenuous tasks to save innocent lives and this is where the film needlessly introduces Samuel L. Jackson, McClane's partner, (for some reason) and the two fight for the whole movie. Jackson does do a great job in this film, like always, but... how is that charming? It isn't. Yet people seem to say that their chemistry is ""superb"", but pretty much for the whole movie they're arguing about race issues when there's a psychotic bomber on the loose. Simon, played by Jeremy Irons, is amazing and by far the best part of the film. Halfway through the film, it is revealed that Simon is actually Hans Gruber's brother. Hans Gruber, who was played by Alan Rickman, was the main villain of DIE HARD. This is ingenious, since Jeremy Irons both looks and sounds like Rickman. Irons has the charisma and chops to live up to Rickman, but his lines are silly, and he can't even measure up to Rickman's amazing performance. This isn't Irons' fault, but he isn't given much to work with.Simon reveals to McClane that he didn't even like his brother, so revenge isn't his motive. He actually only wants a bunch of gold from The Federal Reserve bank and is using the bombs to distract the police force while his massive army )?) and his bizarre girlfriend, I think, steal it. This is also pretty clever, unfortunately it is never explained what exactly he wants this for and the audience is left to assume that the Gruber brothers must just be gambling addicts. It is very unexpected to put a twist on the whole 'revenge' scenario, but, again, this film even has vengeance in the title. Besides, there has to be motivation as to why Simon wants all this money. This is a very complex plan, doesn't he have some higher reasoning for this heist? I think another reviewer put his motives best: He wants revenge for his brother! Oh no, he's just a terrorist. Wait, he's stealing the gold. No, he's going to sink the gold. Oops, no, he's taken the gold and killed his boss... and apparently wants to buy a country? But the two discover Simon's true motives and try to stop the dastardly Simon from going through with his ambiguous plans. And the ending just comes out of nowhere. It isn't spectacular, groundbreaking creative, or awe inspiring like the other film's endings. It's just sort of over, which is weird, because the film goes from having way too much action to too little.What happened to Die Hard With a Vengeance? It had such a brilliant premise! Well, that's anyone's question, but the bigger question is why everyone loves it. It does have some really good scenes and a superb direction (John McTiernan who did 1). Otherwise, it's just a confusing mess. I could barely follow the last half of the movie at all, because it was so poorly written and explained. The cinematography wasn't as good as its predecessors, either. There's no sense of claustrophobic wonder that the other two did so well. It certainly is more creative than 2, but it is so poorly executed that it can't be considered more than a wasted opportunity.I guess I can admire McTiernan for trying to take the series in a different direction that makes you think, rather than mindless action sequences in a building. But unless you're good at math or riddles, you won't get what's going on until after a second viewing or so. In the end, it's just too crowded, unclear, and empty to be a worthy sequel to either of its predecessors.Not saying that I hate it, because it is a great movie, like all the others, but it really takes a couple viewings to appreciate and understand the film, and that is definitely a sign of weakness for this. Go see it, but don't get discouraged if you get confused, because it's bound to happen. Definitely worth a viewing, especially if you're a Die Hard fan. You won't be disappointed with it, but you do have to watch it a couple times to understand it fully. This isn't a bad thing, it just isn't as effective as its predecessors. Still, the premise is very clever, and I suppose that overrides the film's flaws, especially if you can make sense of them with a second viewing. Probably better than Die Hard 2 overall, but it has muddled pacing.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

And he directed this thing with one, too. This movie is so awesome. Now I feel as if my favorite is still the first film. But this is definitely the best sequel and one of the best action films ever made. No matter what your ranking is though, it's in great company (not including the 5th movie, and I like 4 but it doesn't touch this one either). What makes this Die Hard movie stand out from all the rest is that it's the first one to break out from him being in a confined area. Rather than a huge plaza or an airport, New York City is the entire setting. Since John is an NYPD cop, we're on his turf. Bruce Willis once again owns this role as John McClane. And Sam Jackson is easily the best ally in the entire franchise that McClane has had. They work very well together, and Zeus (Jackson) has to be ""in the game"" as well. So John's not alone this time. And real quick, I must say that the way that Zeus is set up in this movie is actually kind of daring. It does get addressed but you do grow to like him. And Jeremy Irons as Simon was also quite good. I know the movie is 26 years old, but I still won't reveal a certain plot point concerning him. McTiernan's filmmaking is on point here, and the action is just spectacular. There's such high energy and fun here. It builds and builds throughout. The ""Die Hard"" movies are movies that you don't have to necessarily watch in order, but at least watch the first before this one. There's a good reason for that.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
250,iskra-3,One of the finest action films ever,10,9 April 2000,"Die Hard With A Vengeance has a lot to live up to. The original film changed the way action pictures were made and made Bruce Willis and director John McTiernan in demand. The 1990 sequel was an example of exemplary craftsmanship by director Renny Harlin, and grossed $117 million in the US, adding to a total of $237 million worldwide. In this 1995 film, John McTiernan returns and so does John McClane, to his hometown of New York.In the morning of a hot day of a hot New York summer, a bomb explodes at a department store, throwing everyone into panic. The bomber, called Simon (Jeremy Irons), telephones the police and orders that the suspended McClane (Bruce Willis) complete a series of tasks or more bombs, which have been hidden around the city, will explode. While doing the first challenge in Harlem, McClane picks up shopkeeper Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) to help him. They continue to jump through hoops for Simon as the plot unravels, exhibiting a gold heist and some terrific chases.The action in this film is outstanding. At one point, Simon orders McClane and Zeus to get to a pay phone at the Wall Street subway station in 30 minutes (they are about 90 blocks away). Commandeering a taxi, they blaze through rush hour streets, cutting through Central Park (literally) and following behind an ambulance to cut traffic. This chase is absolutly exhilarating, because it uses the city as a major character instead of just a backdrop. The way it is filmed adds immensly to the thrills and the entire movie continues this way. It leaves you breathless.The acting is also very good, with Irons, Willis and Jackson rounding out the top spots and Grahame Greene and others doing nicely in supporting roles. And to keep the movie from becoming too unpleasant, the humor of the Die Hard films shines right through. While Willis can still pull the wisecracks, the best scenes are in his banter with Jackson, who is also very humerous.The best thing about this movie is that it is fun. Its the perfect summer movie: it gives you the feel of a day in the summer in the city, it is action packed, funny and just plain fun. Some people say that it strays too far away from the other 2 films but I disagree. Taking away the claustrophobia of the first 2 and switching it with a wide expanse boosts the originality of the series, along with the fact that it works very well.Note: Die Hard With A Vengeance was the highest-grossing movie worldwide of 1995 ($365 million). Hint, hint, Fox. Lets see Die Hard 4.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

McTiernan, returning from the original, proves his skill at large-scale destruction and general mayhem. Several of the huge explosions in various parts of Manhattan, shot in a realistic hand-held reportage style are especially sobering images after 9/11. Overall, very similar to the original film, with Euro-Psychos wreaking havoc upon New York instead of L.A.Willis plays Willis playing McClane, which is not a bad thing.

Of course, that is not really a good thing. In Die Hard 3, we have a heavier and balder (although you really could not tell with the wonderful toupee they spray-painted on his head) Bruce Willis trying to solve an inanely plotted heist. The heist in fact is a multi-billion dollar planned affair, that must have been needed to cover the expenses of the robbery itself. While this ridiculous scheme is being played out, Bruce Willis must teach old racist Samuel Jackson that whites are not bad. Jackson is as irritating as he was in ""Changing Lanes."" But Bruce Willis will show him he should quit acting like an angry black guy. In fact, they kind of bond, which is what you have to do, when the mad German Evil Genius behind the caper requires them to solve 123 puzzles during the film (which I hear is common in robberies). Of course, the supporting cast is wonderfully stereotyped with characters you have seen in 100 other action movies. Will the gruff and balding Willis be able to stop the bad guy? Might he be able to do it by some moronic twist of irony? Gee I hope not, because I could not stand a fourth installment of this garbage. Thanks!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
257,wentos,great stuff but few plot problems,8,21 May 2021,"I like the franchise. I mean it is over the top in such over the top manner that it makes it cool. Many scenes where both characters should have died if they were human but did not, do not disturb too much. What I found appalling is when Willis makes an escape from the underground and his partner just drives by. This was way off. I buy all the incredible scenes but this just is too much off. I liked the flight tho. Other than this great movie.Woke points: there are surprisingly not that many or at least not ones that the woke would have made now. All the ""anti-racist"" statements are being properly called racist and I laugh at them as I should and as I did when I saw it first time in the cinema when the movie came out. This was made joke back then and now is dead serious. There were strong and weak, good and evil, female and male and black and white characters - the film was truly diverse without making anybody look bad, besides Germans. But hey - we deserve it. Not because of the war but because most of us are mindless, humourless followers of the leader. If the leader is a psychopath it it goes wrong.

The only part about this movie I don't like is how the characters can be so racist. I am white and I don't go around making fun and wherein signs that say: I Ni**rs in New York. Come on why do people have to be so racist now a days, can't we all just get along.I think the characters in this movie are 100% fully developed except for John, but if you watch the first and second, you will see why he isn't developed in this one. I love the end how they are trapped onto the HUGE bomb and how John hands Zeus the pick and they get out and don't become bomb food just in the nick of time. Also, just like in the other ones he does his famous and favorite word called Yu-Pi-Ki-Yey mother f**ker.I can't any more about this heartwarming movie except that if you have not seen this get going' right away. Peace Out.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

262,lionel2,"underrated gem, actually the best die hard !",10,29 April 2003,this movie get action and humor as the first die hard. but it also has surprise and film-noir ( don't miss the scene in which big corporate executives enjoy counting how many firemen are arriving to the exploded subway station ) which the first die hard doesn't have. and did i say the great plot in which john mcclane must go through till he realize what is really going on under the surface. this story is so brilliant and it makes the die hard 2 looks stupid. my rating of this movie is 9. i haven't seen anything like this in an action movie so filled with thriller elements. the first die hard deserves an 8 and die hard 2 only get 7 in my rating.,Die Hard with a Vengeance
263,milstar,McClaine's having very bad day,10,18 March 2013,"John McClaine once again returns as hard-edged cop after slightly worse Die Hard sequel, in another action-explosive filled pack adventure and reuniting with terrific John McTiernan (directed first 1988 film). This time setting is New York. McClaine is suspended, under divorce and drinking. Mysterious Simon has place several bombs throughout the city and needs for McClaine to co-operate, otherwise he'll blow another location (in opening sequence, he destroys department store). However, Simon holds another plan... and McClaine is only one who can stop him, with the help of black man Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). And all this sets the mood for frenetic chase through New York and ferocious action sequences. Yes, McTiernan is really fantastic action director. Plot is witty and never gets boring. Willis and Jackson are having great chemistry together, regardless this is not buddy cop movie. Soundtrack is simply memorable. Tasks (or riddles) that Simon provides for McClaine are always imaginative and do well for the overall plot. And, for the conclusion... My choice is still original feature, still remains as seminal action film. But this one is almost as the first one, Willis and Mctiernan are back and movie itself is an vast improvement over two recent entries, which I want to forget as soon as possible.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
264,Visitor_C,Innovating Into Something Different,8,30 May 2014,"Die Hard: With a Vengeance is the third film in the Die Hard series, and like the others it is not half bad. It redeems itself after the second film, with a couple of major difference. The first major change is having a well planned villain, like the original film. Jeremy Irons as a German terrorist who seeks vengeance is enjoyable to watch. The second major difference that made the film better was the introduction of a more personal sidekick, in this case it is Samuel L. Jackson. Both of these changes increase the watchability of this film, and brings something new to a continuous film series. The fact still remains that it can still get worse, and it will with the newest installment. That is for another review. All in all this film is a decent action flick that is worth a look especially if you have seen the first two films.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
265,wolf-53,Good movie,8,30 March 1999,"Although it is not as good as the original Die Hard, it is still a very good action movie, and it is better than the second one.  You definitely need to suspend your logic when you watch this, but if you can do that it is great.Everything seems to work pretty well in this film.  The performances in it are great.  Bruce Willis is once again perfect in a role Taylor made for him.  Samuel L. Jackson is also great as Willis unwilling partner.  The two have great chemistry together, and I burst out laughing every time they talk to each other.  Jeremy Irons is perfect in the role of the bad guy.  The humor is good, and the song at the beginning is a nice touch.  John McTiernan once again proves himself to be a great action director.This movie does copy the original in many cases, and at times during the film you think to yourself that there is no way that could possibly happen, but that doesn't mean it isn't an enjoyable movie.   9/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance

But, like most trilogies (Star Wars and The Godfather are exceptions), the first is the best, the second is good, and the third (compared to the first two) is the worst.  While Die Hard with a Vengeance isn't a bad action movie, it just doesn't reach that level of greatness that the first two flicks had.  Samuel L. Jackson is particularly enjoyable as prejudiced shop owner Zeus Carver (What, you think I'm Puerto Rican?!  He said 'Hey, Zeus,' not Jesus!).

He is on suspension, but when a madman who goes by the name ""Simon"", blows up a truck on a New York sidewalk, he is called back into action. Simon gives McClane objectives and riddles to solve, or else he blows up more building, including a school. With the help of a black shopkeeper (played by the always awesome Sam Jackson) John must save New York yet again.What can I say about this movie? Jeremy Irons, (who brilliantly plays Simon) rivals the acting of Mr. Alan Rickman in the original Die Hard. The explosions look and sound awesome.

It changed the action genre forever, with it's inventive ideas like setting the movie in one building. It has became a forever classic with it's Christmas setting and Alan Rickman's second best performance, but Die Hard: With a Vengeance was also an incredible movie and it's a shame that it's often forgotten or downrated! And the main reasons this movie is so good are it's Villain and screenplay. Jeremy Irons is fantastic in this movie, one of his best performances!

273,Virginia_Farmboy,The Best of the Die Hards,7,25 January 2007,"The third installment in the Die Hard series is the best for several reasons. It plays more like a traditional cat-and-mouse thriller than a standard action movie, putting it a cut above the first two films. While they focused on explosions and gunplay, this adds elements of humanity and character development (in addition to the explosions and gunplay, of course!). It also features a suspenseful script that would keep first-time viewers guessing as to where the plot is headed. The stunts contained in Die Hard: With A Vengeance are also the best of the series, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Finally, any film that opens with the classic ""Summer in the City"" is surely a good film.Definitely watch this film. It's an underrated two hours of entertainment.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
274,GanzEhrlich,Awesome Sequel,10,21 August 2014,"Its set in New York, pre 9/11. It has Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson too. There's a lot of action, including numerous explosions. Die Hard with a Vengeance is an epic film. I have not seen the original Die Hard but this is great anyway.Simply, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), the brother of German terrorist Hans Gruber, who was killed by John McClane at the end of the first movie, is out for revenge (hence the title, I presume?) and has planted a series of bombs in New York to distract the police, while simultaneously Simon and his men rob the main gold reserve in Manhattan. John McClane (Bruce Willis), enduring a hangover and ""a bad ******* headache"" and an unfortunate electrician named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) are out to stop them.Of course the film's content is ludicrous. There are loads of action scenes that should have killed McClane and Zeus, but the film has so many moments that don't feel that stupid and ruin the film for you. Yes, the ending is a bit anti-climatic but the rest of the film really makes up for that. Having SLJ and Irons on-board really helps as well. I like how John McClane is teamed up with someone in the film, especially someone with emotion.I don't watch Die Hard 3 that often, but it is definitely one of my favourite action films. Sheer entertainment.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Action: 9 Thriller: 7 Comedy: 8 This is simply the best action film I have ever seen and it's the best of the Die Hard trilogy I think. Bruce plays an excellent alcoholic cop who has a bad f****** headache all day long. Jackson plays an excellent, wrong place at the wrong time, shop owner who has to play along with Simon's little gags. Has some dumb laughable moments in it as well. Bruce surfing on a truck? Bruce and Jackson fall of a 25 meter crane and can get up again with having now pain at all? But we can look these actions through the fingers as they are very, very funny.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
276,frog663,More Die Hard: With a Whimper,7,25 January 2004,"I will admit that, when I saw Die Hard 3 in the theater, I was completely disappointed.  While the first two Die Hards were packed with adrenaline, this one seemed to just sit there.  However, having had the opportunity to watch it again, I find myself a little less critical of it.  In actuality, had this not been labelled a Die Hard installment, it would've held up as a decent action film.  Sure, it pales by comparison to the first two films, but I don't think it aspired to be anything more than what it is. 
Bruce Willis' John McClane bore no resemblance to the McClane we remember so fondly. If anything, he could've been a distant cousin of characters he has played in other movies, such as The Fifth Element, for example.  What was missing, for me, was the occasional witty aside that has been the staple of the series.  His ""mime"" comment aside, there really weren't any memorable lines uttered.  If the first two Die Hards were rollercoaster rides, this one was more a ride on the merry-go-round!If I have any major complaint about this film, it was the ending.  When I first saw it, I couldn't help but think that the producers had run out of money and had to throw together some kind of ending to wrap things up. Repeated viewings have done little to change that opinion.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by the previous two films, but I felt cheated by the way they chose to bring down the curtain on this one.  Overall, I would say that Die Hard 3 does work.  The cat and mouse games were involving, the ""bad guys"" were properly menacing, and there was more than enough suspense throughout.  Change the ending, and leave out the references to his marriage and you've got yourself a pretty terrific little movie.  Still, even as is, it's worth watching.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

290,InMyTribe,"Willis, Jackson, Irons, Greene, Camp. Can it get any better than this ?",8,20 October 2001,"Although this has been billed as 'Die Hard 3' this film can stand alone from the other two predecessors. Bruce Willis is back again as maverick cop John McClane. He is summoned back on duty (he was suspended because of his drinking - due to his divorce) because 'simple Simon' (Jeremy Irons) requests that McClane solve some dangerous riddles or New York schools will be blown up. Samuel L Jackson (as a citizen) is an unwitting accomplice to McClane as they run around New York trying to outwit the maniac Irons. Graham Greene (Dances With Wolves) and Colleen Camp (They All Laughed, Greedy, Wayne's World) are brilliant in support as Willis's cop mates trying to find the bomb while Willis & Jackson chase after Irons.Willis gives his best performance in this series (he won't be better until 'The Sixth Sense'). Jackson, as always, gives nuance to a type-cast role. Irons supplies a ridiculous German accent. Greene (a most under-rated actor) lends a balance to the heroics in the film and character actress Colleen Camp is inspiringly cast in a dramatic role. She handles the macho elements in the film well. Her best line comes when Greene asks 'Who wants to blow up a mall'? - ""Ever see a woman miss a shoe sale""?

It is pretty action-packed, you have to say that for it. But a lot of the jokes don't work, and, though not its fault, the constant bantering on race issues feels very 90s and dated. But flat humor is its fault, as well as, at times, flat drama--especially when we're first getting to know Simon, his whole persona seems quite goofy. The other supporting cast seemed rather weak as well (the police chief for instance). I'd also argue it ran on a bit too long (or maybe I was just getting sleepy). Not to say I hated it, or that it didn't hold my interest for the most part, but I'd expect more from the director of the original Die Hard.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
293,Bigugly,"Not the best Die Hard, but the Funniest",8,10 July 1999,"First, the weaknesses of Die Hard with a Vengeance:  what makes the first two so endearing is that John McClane's presence is unexpected:  just being there sets off the bad guys' plans, and his cat-and-mouse game with the bad guys is what created the sub genre of hostage situation action films. This time, Simon Gruber requests McClane's presence and they switch roles, this time with the terrorist playing tricks on the good guys.  Second, the ""climax.""  We spend two hours watching some very exciting moments which lead to an uncharacteristically weak, disappointing conclusion.That said, Die Hard with a Vengeance is nonetheless a fine conclusion to one of the finest non-sci fi action trilogies ever.  The addition of Samuel L. Jackson as an unwilling partner gives humor to a series which was never short on character.  And McClane's aquaduct sequence is one of the best and funniest of the series.  This film is not for everyone because of a violent second half and almost enough profanity to put Willis' and Jackson's earlier project, Pulp Fiction, to shame.  Speaking of which, did anyone else catch the Pulp Fiction reference at the beginning?With plenty of thrills and comedy, Die Hard with a Vengeance is a must-see for fans of any one of the stars.  I've read and heard rumors of a fourth project, and hope they are true.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
294,curtisloew,I willed it a better review than it deserves,6,6 May 2008,"Die Hard, Die Harderdo the films keep getting better? Or are they slipping from their success? Die Hard: With a Vengeance seems to favour the latter. Samuel L. Jackson brings a fantastic new dynamic to the films. His ability to add humour in the necessary places to bring that 'awe' sense in action movies certainly adds flavour to the screenplay. Indeed, his obvious friendship with Bruce Willis does seem to be reflected in his performance. However, despite the names and the prizes, Die Hard: With a Vengeance left a lot to be desired. What Die Hard 2 lacked in a script Die Hard: With a Vengeance tried to repair, very unsuccessfully. The childish 'riddles' and 'games' although obviously meant to be satirical and ironic, annoyed me distracting the mind of the 'willing to watch' into a strange sense of boredom, not normally accessed when watching a high budget action movie. Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Simon Gruber fluctuated, his insanity almost too little and too light, unlike his Scar in 'The Lion King'. Add to this the music which irritated me immensely. The typical Noah's Ark song arranged for an orchestra giving a 'deep' and 'sinister' tone was clumsy and distracted me from the film. All of these elements surmounted a complete absurdity throughout the entire film that makes me think Die Hard: With a Vengeance is possibly my least favourite Die Hard film as yet.Of course, as with any high budget action movie the special effects were commendable. The explosions were big and the shoot-out (where they existed) were frantic. However, the special effects seemed to challenge the absurd, Willis flying 50 feet into the air from a man-hole cover, before regaining his footing and carrying on.I think I expected more from this movie, I willed it a better review than it deserves. It seems, that Die Hard is long gone in the past and all we are left with now is the memory of John McClane's heroics at the Nakatomi tower.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

296,AleaClint,This Modern Day Cowboy is Getting Old.,8,10 September 2009,"DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is the third installment in the Die Hard series and finds our beloved cop hero, John McClane, at home in New York City. The brother of the lead terrorist that McClane got rid of in the first film, seems to have a personal vendetta to settle with McClane. Simon (Jeremy Irons) has McClane perform all sorts of life-endangering stunts for his amusement. One stunt involves McClane wearing a very racist sign stark naked in Harlem. He is saved there by a local store owner, Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) who because of his Good Samaritan deed, inadvertedly becomes a part of the plot. Actually, Simon is just using his hatred of McClane as a cover for his real plot, to steal the Federal Reserve in NYC. Whereas the original DIE HARD was a guy's romance (lots of action all to save the girl), DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is a buddy movie. The pairing of Willis and Jackson is genius and the comraderie and verbal wit between the duo is pure delight. The movie has a great deal of action but doesn't have as tight script as the original DIE HARD. It tries to make up for that with bigger explosions and action scenes. Of course sometimes bigger isn't always better. Some of the early scenes were so realistic that this movie was postponed for a few months because of the Oklahoma City bombing. After 9-11, some may find some of the scenes to be uncomforting, unsettling, and hitting too close to home. But keep in mind, this movie was made when Hollywood kept feeding us the myth--that we all wanted to believe-- that terrorism could never happen to us. Other than the scenes that some may find unsettling and a loose script, the other drawback of the film is that McClane is separated from his beloved wife Holly, which just doesn't fit the DIE HARD formula. The first two films were guy romances which made them enduring. This picture has taken that romantic element out and attempted to replace it with the buddy angle. It works, but it isn't as enduring. Whereas in the first two movies, McClane was saving the world to save his wife, in this movie he's saving the world to save his life.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

I like the Die Hard movies in general but this picture reached a whole new level. The claustrophobia of the first film is eclipsed by the scope of the setting in Vengeance. It's as though the director thought 'New York looks like a good playground for John McClane, how much damage can he do?'. And it truly is the perfect setting, not just in terms of size but the fact that it is McClane's home town and for once he is no longer a fish out of water. It's his job, and he's going to do it the way he wants tooeven if he is nursing the hangover from hell.But of course there are other action movies out there and in the modern world of CGI it seems the movie was limited to what it was able to blow up. Lets face it filming in the busy streets of downtown New York couldn't have been an easy task. But the film succeeds on more than just explosions due to the dynamic relationship between Willis and his co Star Samuel L Jackson (Zeus). The idea of two guys put in a position where they have to work together despite their initial grievances towards each other always conjures up a degree of comedy and drama. Similarly, unlike most action heroes McClane is far from perfect. He drinks, he smokes, and he's a terrible husband and father, yet still kicks ass in the most insane way when it comes to terrorism.Now I said I would get to the role of Simon, the new nemesis of McClane. As we do not find out whom he is at first I will not ruin it, but needless to say Jeremy Irons puts in a great display as Simon. He is the perfect puppet master and it is nice to see a Die Hard bad guy that is actually capable of outsmarting John a little bit.All in all this is a great summer blockbuster and an example to all of how a sequel should be done. Up the action, up the stakes and keep the explosions coming.Awesome 10/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
302,videogamenews,Great sequels die hard,9,4 August 2019,"I watched this back in '95 an I re-watched almost 24 years later to reach the same conclusion: it's a great action movie.The simple fact that it's still very enjoyable after all this time shows how good it was in the first place. Action packed, funny, unpredictable are only some of the words that come to your mind when you're watching Die Hard with a Vengeance.McTiernan really pulled all the stops with the pacing and the cast:, creating a formula that sadly few films have succesfully copied. Also, New York is the perfect background for the visual chaos that's thrown to the screen every couple of minutes. In fact, the intro sequence alone is already a classic.The only negative points are a third act that's too tame compared to the beginning and a few jokes that weren't good back then and are even worse now. All in all, however, we're talking top notch stuff here, and a true classic in the action genre.Best of the sequels, almost as good as the first",Die Hard with a Vengeance
303,Davebop,This film is great,9,4 February 2001,"Great film, with bruce and samuel at their peak. Lots of great explosions making it great.

304,doublenpatriot,John McClane is kicking ass again!,8,8 July 2008,"Die Hard: With a Vengeance is the one of the pound breaking sequel ever made. McClane is pulled back into action to stop the madman Simon Gruber ( The Brother of deceased Hans Gruber. )from turning New York City inside out. Along the way, McClane is assisted by Zeus Carver ( Samuel Jackson ) to thwart Simon's plan. THIS is how you make a sequel and it will keep you one the edge of your seat. Good Things: The action and suspense are very well executed also the acting is incredible with the formula of Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson. Bad things: The only gripe I have with the movie is the intentions of Simon's, was he looking for revenge or was he just tricking McClane? Why did he say that he hated his brother if the movies called Die Hard with a Vengeance? I mean it's just confusing. Still this movie is a great sequel to the Die Hard Series, I recommend you buy it and you'll be bitting your nails.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
305,ax-23,Just a terrific movie to all audiences well not young audiences,9,20 August 2006,"Die hard with a vengeance is definitely one of the greatest movies ever!!! It's not boring or tiring it's uplifting and filled with action sense that will make you'r heart pound. I've seen this movie at least 10 times now and to be honest I've never got bored of it. The introduction to Sam Jackson is stunning and Bruce Willis going out into the city with a sign saying... Well I can't say but if you've watched you no. Jeremy Irons does a Superb performance as Simon the terrorist because his voice is creepy and haunting. In my mind, it's not as good as the first Die Hard because that's a classic but this s terrific and exiting from start to finish. So if you didn't like this film and you thought it was dull and shallow then you must have mental probolems or not all your dogs are barking!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
306,gordon_brennan,Third Die Hard Film Breaks Out While Staying In Form,10,2 October 2009,"Die Hard With a Vengeance reunites actor Bruce Willis and director John McTiernan for a second sequel to their 1988 mega-thriller Die Hard. Adapted from a non-Die Hard script titled Simon Says by screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh, this third chapter in the John McClane saga is more offbeat and just a bit darker than expected. Although it still follows the Die Hard formula - and how could it not? - of McClane versus formidable obstacles, Die Hard 3 wisely avoids the Christmas Crises scenarios from the first two films. Gone also (although the movie never really explains why) is Bonnie Bedelia's Holly, although she is mentioned in several scenes. Apparently McClane never adjusted to life in Los Angeles and returned to his job in the New York Police Department. So when a bomb goes off at a Bonwit Teller store in Manhattan, it is providential for the Big Apple that McClane is a lieutenant in New York's Finest, albeit a depressed and beer-swilling lieutenant. Providential because we know that when arch-villain ""Simon"" (Jeremy Irons) demands that McClane participate in a potentially deadly version of the game ""Simon Says,"" our Everyman hero will rise to the occasion and thwart Simon's deadly scheme. As in the first Die Hard film, McTiernan pairs McClane with an interesting partner. Where in the 1988 flick Willis was helped by Reginald Veljohnson (better known as Carl from Family Matters), in Die Hard with a Vengeance his charismatic and reluctant partner is played by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Star Wars Episodes I and II). Their ""unlikely buddies"" routine is energetic and witty, and Jackson plays his Harlem store owner character with a mixture of biting wit, bewilderment, and even dignity. The Special Edition 2-disc set, like the previous two in the series, contains the movie on Disc 1 with interactive menus, anamorphic Widescreen presentation, various audio and subtitle options, and commentary by director McTiernan and screenwriter Hensleigh. Disc 2, of course, has the usual theatrical trailer and TV spots, several TV ""making of"" specials, a special-effects breakdown, and an interview with Bruce Willis.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
307,XPrufrock,The best of the trilogy,9,21 August 2000,"Die Hard with a Vengeance was an excellent film. Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson have great chemistry and WILL work together again. This movie pumped new blood into the Die Hard series, after the less than stellar performance of Die Harder, with the tie-ins from the first movie and the new characters and intriguing way the two leads interacted solving puzzles and running around New York to beat the clock.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
308,fozzie2099,Good 3rd installment of the series,7,30 May 2004,"I always enjoy watching the Die Hard series, and with Die Hard 3 you get the rare third installment of a series that is really strong enough to stand on its own. You could have never seen the first two movies of the trilogy and still get an understanding of McClanes character and why Simon wants to kill him.  In fact, McClanes attitude is such you may not blame anyone all that much for wanting to kill him at least at the beginning of the movie. He's a drunk, his wife has left him, again, and he's suspended from his job as a police detective. The cast is strong, though the acting is not brilliant some of it does stand out and this is one of Jeremy Irons classic roles perfectly cast as a smart, riddle spouting villain. Sam Jackson plays the sidekick role with a sharp tongue and is as enjoyable, as he usually is in most of his movies.   The plot is interesting and somewhat clever.  They could have just thrown out another canned movie in the mold of the first 2 but instead made it into a game of sorts that the audience could get into with the riddles (I was almost shouting the answer to the 2 water jugs riddle when I first saw it). The idea that the Federal Reserve Bank with all that gold being left relatively unguarded by the police was a stretch, the FBI at least would have ensured its security. A minor plot hole though that doesn't take away from the enjoyability of the film (well, maybe not considering how inept our law enforement can be in this country). All in all, you don't have to stretch your imagination to believe the plot and thats a plus for an action movie trying to appeal to the average moviegoer.   Die Hard With A Vengeance is an entertaining action film with a good cast and plot. Considering that most action movies simply go for formula and big hype to drive their box office, its nice to see movies like this one. 7/ 10.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
309,mlshoe,Eh... Not in the Same League as I and II,6,28 December 2003,"Despite adding the talents of Samuel L. Jackson, this one just doesn't stand up.

Obviously the first one was incredible and nothing can ever really live up to it in my mind, but this one (the third one) is at least as good as the second Die Hard film, and they are both definitely a million times better than the awful Die Hard films that have come since the first three.Great action, lots of good humor, good acting. This movie has it all, even a fantastic villain. Plus Samuel L. Jackson in a supporting role. This is a great action movie.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
311,Efram,They just keep getting better...,8,15 April 1999,"The idea that the McClane character is playing around in a whole city and not just confined to a small area fighting terrorists was what I really enjoyed. It was a great change of pace from the first two and still incorporated the elements of the ones before it. I liked this the best out of the three, with the second following. The second is extremely underrated and, I think, had much better action sequences and a better plot. I also liked how I felt as if I was in New York in the Summer. I really got a good feel of the atmosphere in NY (being from there originally) and could almost feel the Summer time heat at points. I guess it's a sense of nostalgia. Yes, there are some moments logic takes a back seat, but if I can let it slide, almost anyone could be able to. The only big problem I had was the ending. It just well... happened. All of the sudden everyone is in Canada and all is done. Left me empty, but I was OK with it because it was like the abrupt end to a good roller coaster ride. This thing starts right at the beginning with a bang and doesn't let up. Great adrenaline rush!",Die Hard with a Vengeance

313,serviola,"This movie is not underscored, and this is why",7,26 August 2007,"I have seen a lot of fuss about how underrated this movie is. One has to admit that it is a very entertaining, action-packed and sometimes very funny film. It was great to watch and I had a good time doing so, but honestly, it is not a clever picture.In order to enjoy it, one has to give to it the same license as one gives to a James Bond or Harry Potter movie. If one concentrates on the fact that it is impossible for a taxi to fly in the air all through Central Park and continue working fine or that magic does not exist, then you will not enjoy certain types of films.If you think about it, there are more holes in the plot, storyline and overall logic than bullet holes in total.And I am not talking about how easy it would be to dismantle the bombs or if McClain would have died at the initial tasks, the fail-proof diversion would make no sense. I refer to situations such as when everyone in the police force, FBI and even public servants in the NY metropolitan area knew that there was a 10KT bomb in a school where one of their sons, grandsons, or nephews was studying and the story did not leak. Absurd! Or when McClain realizes that it was all a diversion and the idea is to rob the Federal Reserve. He does not tell his boss because he is not 100% sure; instead he goes inside the bank to check. And when he sees what has happened, he still thinks that chasing 14 trucks driven by an army of mercenaries with an old compact car is a better idea than calling for backup. Only when the trucks escape at the Bridge he decides it is time to tell his boss.There are movies that have all the thrill and excitement of Die Hard 3 without all this nonsense. Take for instance Inside Man. That is a clever action movie. That is why it is rated better than this.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
314,coreym-5,"Best of the series, IMO",8,4 April 2009,"I usually only do reviews for films I hate, but this is one of the best films I have ever seen. 128 minutes of pure gold (which is not meant to be a reference to the subplot of the film).Anyway, this is, in my opinion, the best in the ""Die Hard"" series, it makes up for the disappointment of the 2nd film. In this film, Hans Gruber's brother, Simon, is making phone calls to John McClane and telling him where bombs are set, and how long McClane has to stop them from exploding.With some of the best action sequences on film, including an awesome scene where McClane is chased down a tunnel of falling water, ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" is a true action film and one of the best of it's kind.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
315,wfuller1994,The most under-appreciated sequel imaginable,9,8 September 2013,"This movie doesn't get enough love if you ask me. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a pulse pounding, explosive and smart action movie that actually almost comes close to trumping the original Die Hard if you ask me. In this movie, Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons), brother of Hans Gruber, is out for revenge on John McClane, now in his hometown of New York City, for killing his brother at the Nakatomi Plaza that Christmas Eve of 1988, while attempting to steal the gold from the Federal Reserve's gold vault. Paired up with a pawn shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) it's up to them to solve Simon's cryptic phone calls by playing a game of ""Simon Says."" This movie somewhat deviates away from the original's idea of one man trapped in a location, which I actually really like seeing as though some originality is needed in a sequel or it'll just be considered a rehash. Add in terrific chemistry between Willis and Jackson, who really should be in more movies together, along with explosive action and a great villain, Die Hard 3 is a near perfect follow up to the original and in my opinion the best sequel in the franchise.9.5/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance
316,jackmarston,Terrific,10,12 December 2018,Die hard with a vengeance is one of the most hyped up sequels I've been informed about. Considered close to or on par with the original die hard. I've found that I like this film slightly more than the original. Mostly due to Samuel l Jackson. Also I love the concept of the film with Simon says. It just works so well. One criticism is I prefer the alternative ending but the original is serviceable. It doesn't really subtract from the films experience.,Die Hard with a Vengeance
317,tezza-1,PURE GENIUS!!!,8,19 March 2002,"This film is pure brilliance, its got everything an action movie should have.Its got a brilliantly cast.As usual Bruce Willis makes a outstanding performance as NYPD Lt John Mcclaine and Samuel L. Jackson is superb as a electrician caught up in this mess.What can i say about Jeremy Irons what a terroist he makes.What an EXCELLENT movie!!!!!!!!!!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
318,supergamer125,A great 90's action movie,8,16 August 2015,"Die Hard with a Vengeance brings back John McTiernan as the director and brings back some more of the original Die Hard elements. For example John McClane is separated from his wife putting him down on his luck again. He got suspended from the NYPD and starts the film off hung-over. So bottom line he doesn't start off very happy.This time instead of being in a single small area, he's in NYC. The setting always gets bigger. A new villain emerges; Simon (Jeremy Irons), who is setting off bombs around NYC. He threatens with more explosions unless John plays Simon Says (get it). However John McClane isn't the guy in wrong place at the wrong time, as Simon specifically asks for McClane to play Simon says. Instead the guy in the wrong place at the wrong time is Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson). He saves McClane from one of Simon's games that gets ugly quickly and gets stuck having to join McClane on the game of Simon Says to protect NYC from Simon's explosives.One of the best things of the movie is McClane and Zeus' relationship. It is highly entertaining. They argue, they complain, curse, and help each other. McClane also has more conversations with the villain than Die Hard 2. Since they are always talking to Simon for him to give them their next mission, they'll usually have some good exchanges. Die Hard with a Vengeance adds the tradition that all future Die Hard films need to give McClane a sidekick. Zeus is probably the best sidekick McClane gets.Simon seems like a Bond villain. He comes up with a lot of overly complicated ways to kill McClane and enjoys toying with him instead of killing him. Since a lot of bad guys have the chance to kill the hero but don't kill them in a lot of movies (like Karl from the first one) it does give an excuse as to why Simon doesn't kill McClane when he has the chance.The acting is still good, the action as always is fun, the film has a couple of chuckles here and there, and some great suspenseful scenes. But one thing that just didn't stick well with me was the ending. It just felt out of place and tacked on in the end. From what I read, it sounded like they had a couple of problems on how to end it so I'm not surprised this ending felt rushed. It wasn't bad per say, but seemed as if they didn't want the villain to win so they just said, ""Let's just have McClane find Simon and take him out cause we can't have the villain win."" But at the end of the day Die Hard with a Vengeance is a great 90's action film that is a great sequel to the original that I highly recommend.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
319,CoolHand996,Awesome movie with great action and great chemistry between Willis and Jackson,10,1 November 2004,"Even though the movie differs from the other two, it is one of the best action movies ever made along with Bruce Willis having one of his best performances ever. Even though Bruce had help this time around which is against Die Hard's style, he still was just as cool with great lines and humorous outbursts. The plot itself was strong also as it connected Die Hard 1 to it which was definitely a plus and it also had many twists and turns from beginning to end. This movie is the best 3rd installment to a trilogy that I have ever seen as it easily blows away T3. Die Hard with a Vengeance is a non stop action movie from beginning to end in which the action is justified and the plot makes sense.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
320,RockyAKAEggin,Bruce is Back!,8,17 February 2021,"The Good:Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis are absolutely perfect in their roles and are both visually engaging throughout.I enjoyed the fact that the movie got straight into the action. It starts with a bang (literally) and instantly grabs your attention.There are some great scenes of tension with high stakes. These scenes are genuinely gripping and give a real sense of dread to the audience.I relatively enjoyed the link to the first movie even if it feels rather forced just to fit this movie in with the series.The Bad:This movie feels relatively outcast from the movies in the series that came before it. By this, I mean that it feels less like a Die Hard movie and more like a standard Bruce Willis 90s action flick.I wasn't a huge fan of how there were no returning characters from the previous films. I liked how Die Hard 2 incorporated the characters of Holly, Powell, and Thornberg, but this movie seems to completely omit them, with the exception of Holly who is mentioned but never seen.There was a lot of dialogue relating to race throughout the movie that felt rather unnecessary.A few of the villains felt rather undeveloped and not very interesting. For example the main villain's girlfriend... We learn nothing about her throughout the story and don't get me started on the woefully unnecessary sex scene in the final act.Overall a very high-class action movie that features visually stunning action, high suspense and a solid cast...8/10",Die Hard with a Vengeance

Besisdes the fact that Jackson and Willis are two exceptional actors the screenwriter did a good job on the film.  Don't get me wrong their was soem flaws. As an avid film watcher i feel a good key to a good action film is the beginning.  IT starts out with the sun rising and ends up with a bomb....Ruling: unprdictable, good choice of music nicley done...This film is easily the best of the trilogy.  Irons adds to the explosive cast. Irons plays a terrorist who has forth a huge amount of tasks for Willis and Jackson and they have to do it or they will die.  Really plot twisted film....not as twisted as the hiest.  One of the top 5 best action movies ever made.  Simply jackson and irons best.  The added bonus was the jackson andwillis duo wh onever seemed to like each other.  I wouldnt mind a Die Hard 4VotingPlot  9.5/10-  Some flaws but kept you thinking Script 9.9/10- Alot of swearing but good contrast between sam and bruse.

327,BlowXL,One of the most underestimated movies ever!,10,10 December 2009,"This third part in the Die Hard series is in one word brilliant. It takes you on a ride through New York and the entire city is used as a background for non-stop action. The story, about a crazy bomber (Jeremy Irons) who wants to play a game of Simon Says with John McClane (Bruce Willis), provides an excellent framework for the numerous explosions and car chases. Especially the interaction between Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, who plays a racist shopkeeper forced to help McClane, is probably the best ever seen in a movie. And Jeremy Irons as the German uber-villain is perfectly casted as well. The only bad thing in this movie is the ending (which REALLY is bad) but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. It is by the way an alternate ending: the original ending was canceled by the producers because it was too violent, but can still be seen on the DVD or on youtube.

There is great action sequences including a bomb in a train. It's another roller-coaster ride for Bruce's character John McClane and us as well. The plot is a little dumb at times but from a third action movie that's good anyway, you really don't notice. The acting was also good. Jeremy Irons is a really good bad guy but not as good as Alan Rickman. Most of the time, Bruce and Sam just cuss at each other but it was nice to see Bruce paired up with someone with even more attitude than him.

I am a huge fan of all the Die Hard movies and people on the boards feel that the rank is this:1)Die Hard 2)Die Hard with a Vengeance 3)Die HarderPersonally, I really can't rank them. However this seems to get it quite right as I feel Die Hard will always be the best for it is the original (and a great original at that!) and I think Die Hard with a Vengeance is worthy of second.It was very hard for this movie to be great as when Die Hard came out people didn't really know what to expect, whereas in 1995 we had already seen movies such as Lethal Weapon 1 & 2, Predator 1 & 2, Terminator 1 & 2 etc. It would be very hard for this movie to be pulled off well and be a box office hit however it did do it and proved that John McTiernan is the real daddy of action (with great movies like Die Hard, DHWAV, Predator, The Hunt for Red October)!So please, please, please, please, please don't wreck this franchise with a fourth instalment (unless Mctiernan is directing!)

335,notermites,"Comments stink, to much swearing racism",3,15 July 2009,"It pretty much is a Racist movie and way way to much swearing and swearing and now on TBS it is Blankity Blankity Blank and the voice overs are terrible - The water jug - It just a awful film and in my opinion I really think it is in insult to us as fans that these Films continue Die Hard Live Free was a Joke - Enternaining but a Joke - I hope Bruce does not make anymore of these films; Slevin was good but he is a better actor than the Character in Die Hard films he made some good coin but the audience is getting smarter and also Bruce don't do anything with Weisman again, his ego gets in your way and he is to high on himself and this underworld comments in the DVD.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
336,dahai401,A very fine third,8,5 December 2008,"I recently revisited this movie, after watching the fourth installment of the franchise, and I got to say what a great movie. Samuel L Jackson plays Zeus the unfortunate who has to tag along with Bruce Willis's John McClane on his latest adventure. What follows is just over two hours of reasonably high octane adventure. I was enthralled from the opening scene and every little set piece kept me interested or giggling to myself at the few little comedy moments which are thrown in to keep people amused. With this movie John McClane is firmly established as the ordinary man turned action here. McClane is quite a big guy, but he is no where near the same size as Schwarzenegger or Van Damme. The places he finds himself in this movie would break most people, but he manages to keep away from making the movie feel like a comic movie and keep the audience believing in the character.All the classic elements of an action movie are well wrapped into this more than worth while sequel. It might not live up to the first movie in the series but it certainly goes a long way towards helping define Bruce Willis as a genuine star. I have never seen the TV show Moonlighting, which I understand propelled him into the public eye, and I think without this movie he would not be held in such high regard.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
337,johnjcully3,3 is the magic number,9,24 March 2020,I'm writing this as I am watching this for the umpteenth time and I have to say it's the best of the lot. As clever as this is and as clever as I thought I was... When I first watched this I couldn't get the bottle of water puzzle. Did you??? Anyway there's a lot of misdirection and solid links to the original and the most important thing of all when it comes to all good movies is it's rewatchability. If you're channel hopping and you come across this movie it's almost impossible to not stay put and watch it to the end. 9 outta ten for me.,Die Hard with a Vengeance
338,dontbeamenace,wow! I love this movie more than i love taffy,10,1 July 2006,"I have to say that this is the best action movie ever! I think that Die Hard With A Vengeance is way better than the original but is only a little better than the Die Hard 2: Die Harder. What I don't get is why does it only have a 7.1/10. I give it 10/10. This Die Hard took place all over New York city, which is much more adventurous than the first and the second. I really don't get why everybody loves the first Die Hard better than the other two. The other two take place in a bigger setting, there's better picture, more going on and cooler action scenes. I have to say than I am extremely impressed by Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson's performance for this movie. I really hope the fourth movie will be as good.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
339,nick_rog46,Rapid Weapon with a vengeance,8,2 December 2005,"In the fist Die Hard, John McClane is trap into a building and cannot get out of it. In Die Harder, he's stuck in a airport to save his wife for a second time. I tough it was a cool and a special way of making an action movie. Give kind of claustrophobia feeling with some scene in ventilation systems and those great elevator shot. The Third one is set in the city. From Central park to the Sub and even into an aqueduct. Die Hard with a vengeance is a great action movie, but it doesn't have what the first two had : an action movie with only one setting. I liked how they used all the potential of a high building and a airport. It's like those great 70's catastrophe movies like «Airport» or «The Towering Inferno» and «The Posedeon Adcventure». For the rest, for some reason they gave McClane a partner for the third movie. Sam Jackson is OK, but like I said it's different from the two first. I know the script was first consider for a «Rapid fire 2» and then for «Lethal Weapon 3»,so in these cases they needed two partners. I don't think McClane needed one. There is definitely more action in this one that in the two first, but maybe less jokes. Bruce Willis is still good and Jeremy Irons is a credible villain.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
340,herratommi,Good but not great,7,21 August 2021,"There is almost everything you need in action film, Bruce, Samuel L Jackson and people running around like headless chickens. But there is also poorly written and acted female character and major flaws in storyline. But it is still watchable action movie. Solid 7 from me The Greatest Ever.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
341,Lefonz,This film is GREAT!,10,19 September 1998,"This is a rollercoaster ride of a film.  The action is relentless, explosive, and captivating.  Also, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, gel together perfectly, providing an excellent duo wih outstanding moments of wit, as well as an atmosphere you could cut with a knife.  If you are passionate about action movies, they do not come much better than this!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
342,DougShaw,top action with great humour,8,30 January 1999,"This is one of the best action films I've seen. Just as with the original Die Hard, the action is intense and unrelenting. I think this sequel tops Die Hard, already a great action movie, by taking some of the elements of the original and improving on them further. Jeremy Irons, as villain, is even more eccentric and evil than the villain in the original (played effectively by Alan Rickman). The introduction of Samuel L Jackson to help Bruce Willis fight the baddies, provides continuous humour, as Jackson protests his involvement in the first place, and argues with Willis over who's being racist and how to solve the latest intellectual puzzle given to them by Irons. The New York City setting provides great stereo-typed characters, such as the ""callous Wall Streeters"" eating popcorn and watching a disaster unfold outside their office window, and the dump truck driver who provides Willis with a tour guide's commentary of the underground water system and its history, in the middle of all the panic and mayhem. All in all, top action and great humour!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
343,mmx15,Truly brilliant.,10,23 September 2000,This is my favourite film I have watched it loads of times and still find it to be the best. The comedy blends in well with the action and there's plenty of both. Willis plays the character John McClane so well. If you haven't seen it I say SEE IT!! and also get out a copy of the 2 other movies in the series. The Rock is also another one to see if you liked this. I love this film 10 out of 10,Die Hard with a Vengeance
344,bruno17,great!!!!!!!!!!,10,21 November 2000,"Bruce willis was again the wonderful and smart alicky John McClane. This is truly one of the best !!!!!!John gets hung up w/ hanz grubers brother, an african american whos racist and he and his wife can't seem to stay together. IT is the bomb!!!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
345,mryan429,Best of the Series!,10,21 September 2018,"While the first Die Hard is a classic and an amazing film in its own right, Die Hard 3 takes that film and ups the ante with a sequel that out performs the original. John McTerinan returns to direct and ties the film in well with the original. Jeremy Irons steals the show as Simon Gruber. Willis and Jackson as John McClane and Zeus play off each other so well and contrast one another bringing a ""buddy cop"" aspect to the film.Production: New York City is the star of the film, shot mostly on location, NYC is at its finest with real locations and practical effects which remind us how authentic films used to feel before CGI changed the game.Action: The film starts with a (bang) literally, and doesn't stop building tension, whether it is a high speed chase through Central Park, a train explosion, or a race from a flooded tunnel, the action doesn't stop and builds keeping viewers on the edge of their seat.Overall the film builds tension and has an excellent cast. The only real flaw is a somewhat uninspired ending scene that is adequate but a slight let down to all of the amazing action that came before it. Too bad they kept making Die Hards after this as this film as many fans will admit is the last great one in the series. Some may prefer the original more which is fine, but either way this film is a very worthy follow-up.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
346,johnmclane55,One of the few films that actually outshines the original,10,8 August 2002,"This film was great! McClane is back with his die hard attitude and all those one liners that make the film series so much fun to watch. I think the idea about putting another person (samuel l jackson) at McClanes side, which we didnt see much in the other movies, was a great idea. If you like the other die hards or even if you dont, SEE THIS MOVIE! The action sequences are fantastic and the plot is excellent. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 a must see for any fan of the action genre.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
347,skyy38,Die Hard 3 Sucks,1,15 April 2012,"DIE HARD 3 is nothing more than an over budgeted cash grab.DIE HARD and DIE HARD 2 had the advantage of being pure popcorn movies-something that Mr. and Mrs. America could go see without having to expend too much brain power.My rule for multi-sequels is simple. Anytime another franchise movie comes out, it HAS to come out within 3 years of everything else.DIE HARD was 1988. DIE HARD 2 was 1990. Not too much time to get ""bored"" if you take my meaning.But DIE HARD 3 came out 5 years AFTER DIE HARD 2, and you CAN lose ""the feel"" after such a long period between movies.(MAYBE SPOILER)I objected mostly to the scene when McClane is compelled to wear a sign, in Harlem, that has a most distasteful message printed on it.This was the first sign ( no pun intended ) that this movie wasn't going to be ""fun"". After that, it just gets worse.Sorry Jeremy Irons, but Pee-Wee Herman would have been a better bad guy than you. Not to mention this ""brother crap"" which has been done to death.The cinematography was flatter than a three day old beer.No depth, no artistry, no *nothing*. Too bad that Jan Debont wasn't available, but then again, he had already moved on to better things.The ""Script"" left little room for Willis' normal brand of ""Ad-libs"" and even when it did, even Willis seemed to be tired of the whole bit.Sample line( rough quote ) ""What is this, a triple A rental?"" Ha.....ha.......*ha*.....NOT!!!!!!!!!!!! Really 20th, you should invest more in scripts and less than ""hyperbole"" And now ANOTHER DIE HARD MOVIE???????? Count me the ""yipppe Ki-yayyyyy mother f****r OUT!!!",Die Hard with a Vengeance
348,btcinky,Not as good as the first but better then the second.,9,14 January 2008,"It was good to see the Die Hard movies get back on track with the third film. It may have had the same director, but it took a chance, successfully, on a batch of new characters. Sure the cops were a bit one dimensional, but they generally have been in all the films.(except Al in the first one).Adding Mr Jackson was brilliant for no one does attitude like him.(eg. When McClane asks if they should call an ambulance, Zeus' reply ""Nah f***'em let them burn."") Bruce is McClane, and despite some better acting in movies like Pulp Fiction, he always will be. He gets dirty, he gets hurt( I can imagine his medical insurance premium), and he doesn't like to lose to the bad guys.The action is good, although on a larger scale as the scene is moved from a single site in the first couple of movies to much of New York.The plot is always simple but enjoyable with the constant double crosses(even amongst the baddies) and of course John is the only one smart enough to figure it out.Overall, a great action film as long as you leave your cynicism at the door.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
349,lisa122775,The Best Die Hard,10,23 March 2003,I thought this was the best Die Hard of the trilogy.  Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are a great team.  A lot of one liners make this a very comical movie.  It also has a lot of action as Simon (Jeremy Irons) sends our two hero's on a wild goose chase to make sure nothing else blows up. Jeremy Irons plays an excellent bad guy in this Grade A movie.,Die Hard with a Vengeance
350,bobreki,Best of the series,10,12 October 2013,"The third Die Hard is much better than it's undemanding predecessor, and yes, this is the best of the series. Bigger playground for the plot, great actors and vertiginous action scenes. Exciting and entertaining movie from the beginning to the end. McTiernan is back, and the series reaches its limits or fly to the top, if you like. Heavy and funny duologue's often redoubtable atmosphere. Die Hard With a Vengeance recovery the honor of the series, after Die Harder's shame, and make a constant action classic. I hope John McTiernan will back to direct the sixth act of the series, because he's the man for this job. Has anyone else tried to replace him, went south.",Die Hard with a Vengeance

352,vaaern,Favorite movie,10,14 October 2015,"Not only was this the first Die hard movie I saw, it's also my favorite one. When watching this movie I can only think back to the days when action movies were really action movies. Blood, smoking cigarettes, epic one liners and a good dose of swearing and comedy, albeit dark sometimes.The story is well written, but it keeps a certain action movie-ish feeling, it's good, but it's mainly fun to watch. The characters are lovable in some way, especially John and Zeus (of course). The only bad thing I could say, is that some of the antagonists are a bit confusing, the have a connection and a goal, but the goal isn't very clear. Eventually, after seeing the movie several times, you start noticing small things that let you understand it better, but I feel that towards the end, some scenes could have been added to explain their goals further.All in all, an epic adventure for John Mclane and a trip into 90's action movies, when the genre was still good.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
353,vgalea,Love the film but definite physics goof,8,12 February 2005,"When John is in the aqueduct tunnel and gets out of the dump truck, he hears a soft ""thud"" in the distance, then eventually realizes that there is a huge amount of water coming at him. In that case, there first should have been an almighty rush of air that was being displaced by that water, way before he could actually see the water. I guess it bothers me because it would have been an easy effect to pull off. Along the same lines, why does he stop the dump truck there in the first place. It couldn't be because that metal plate was down on his side, considering how he drove every other (much less sturdy) vehicle he used, before and after that point in the story.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
354,yux1021,One of the Most Exciting Movies I Have Seen!,8,17 February 2005,"I have seen DIE HARD 1, 2 and this one. I think it's the most exciting one of the three. And the bad guys are more violent and smart than the ones in the other two movies. I like Jeremy Irons very much. Simon is so smart that he fools the New York Police Department. I also like his accent. I did not know who Jeremy was before I saw this movie. But as soon as I heard his voice in the movie, I was attracted by him. If Simon could be more careful, he wouldn't be caught by John. I also like Bruce's performance. John is always so brave. He is always ready to fight against bad guys and to protect civilians. He is a responsible man. Bruce always plays roles like this. The two great actors are my favorite. Their charming personalities made this movie an excellent one.",Die Hard with a Vengeance
