0,MartinHafer,Stupid fun,6,30 May 2008,"This is an odd concept for a film--a movie all about bowling! Who would have thought you could make a decent comedy about bowling and who would have thought it would actually be funny? In many ways, the weirdness and irreverent style are very similar to the much later film, TALLADEGA NIGHTS--another ""sport"" that takes well to parody.Was this a brilliant film--probably not. But, in a very low-brow way, it does make you laugh and that is enough some times. It gets very high marks for bizarreness (such as the fake hand and the whole Quaker angle) but also loses marks for, unfortunately, losing steam from time to time with needless plot. When the film tried to be meaningful or didn't go for laughs, it fell a bit flat.",Kingpin
1,SnoopyStyle,audacity to keep trying,6,10 March 2015,"It's 1979. Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was raised by father to be one of the best bowlers in the world. He beats Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) at the 1979 Odor-Eaters championship. Ernie puts sugar in his car engine and convinces the naive Roy to hustle a bowling game. Ernie leaves him behind as the angry mob grinds off his bowling hand. 17 years later, he's reduced to a traveling salesman. He discovers Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) at a bowling alley. He's a nice Amish guy whose family would disown him for bowling. The Farrelly brothers keep trying and trying. Most of the jokes don't work but they keep trying. The premise and the setups are all ridiculously stupid. The characters are marginally compelling and one could root for Munson.",Kingpin
2,Prismark10,Witness this,6,14 June 2015,"Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly made their names in crude comedies that pushed the envelope. In Kingpin they display more of their trademark zaniness and crudeness that they showed in Dumb and Dumber Woody Harrelson plays tenpin bowler named Roy Munson, a potential champion who ended up losing his bowling hand after being tricked by a fellow bowler (Bill Murray).Many years later living a deadbeat life where he does not have enough money to pay the rent. He meets a devout Amish man called Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who he sees as a potential champion and gets him to leave his community and head to Reno to take part in a championship where he meets up again with Bill Murray, now a sleazy bowling superstar with a bad comb-over.The film has plenty of crude humour with Harrelson getting into mishaps with his fake hand and hook. There is low brow humour such as milking a bull believing it to be a cow. Murray pops back at the end with hair that has a life of its own.The film starts off brightly, its refreshingly silly and funny. However it loses its absurdity once they hook up with Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and tries to add depth to the characters. It loses its spontaneity and only becomes sporadically amusing.",Kingpin
3,gavin6942,Decent Gross-Out Comedy,6,13 November 2015,"A star bowler whose career was prematurely ""cut off"" hopes to ride a new prodigy to success and riches.The two big comedies from this team are ""Kingpin"" and ""There's Something About Mary"". Both have some gross-out humor, and this one definitely is not afraid of poop, vomit and bull fluids. I could probably do without all that. And this is probably the lesser of the two. It succeeds in making Lin Shaye, a wonderful person, into a horrifying monster.Funny? Yes. And definitely a different sort of role for Randy Quaid. Bill Murray shines (as always). I always feel a little bit weird when Amish folks show up in films because they seem to be the butt of jokes, and they are probably not even aware that people make fun of them.",Kingpin
4,jboothmillard,Kingpin,4,13 October 2008,"I knew about the leading actor, I knew the premise of the film (about bowling, although it sounds like a gangster film), but I didn't it was directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Basically Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was raised by his father at a young age to be the best bowler in the world, and in 1979, all grown up, he was growing as a champion. Unfortunately his talent was cut off (literally) when fellow bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and him got into a misunderstanding, and Roy lost his bowling hand. Years later, Roy is now living with a metal hook, and a connectible rubber hand, and works as a travelling salesman, but he is going downhill, until he sees the opportunity to get back into the bowling world. One night he sees a skilled bowler, Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), an Amish who secretly went away from his farm to bowl (and he would get disowned if the other Quakers knew). Roy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer to make the world's best bowler, and Ishmael is actually finding life outside the farm quite fun. Roy does soon encounter now top ranking bowling champion Ernie, now obviously his nemesis, and Roy gets his chance to prove he still has his skill (even with the rubber hand) when Ishmael breaks his hand, and he takes over at the ultimate bowling championship. In the end, you don't expect Roy to lose (by one point), but at least he gets the girl, Claudia (Vanessa Angel). Also starring Chris Elliott as The Gambler, William Jordan as Mr. Boorg, Richard Tyson as Owner of Stiffy's, Lin Shaye as Roy's Landlady, Zen Gesner as Thomas Boorg and Prudence Wright Holmes as Mrs. Boorg. Thsi wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be, I could recognise the spoofs of Witness and The Color of Money (with the hustling), but the jokes are a little repetitive, such as the rubber hand and gross landlady in mirror, but not an awful film. It was number 45 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films (it beat Bridget Jones's Diary, Carry On Cleo and The Producers!). Okay!",Kingpin
5,ccthemovieman-1,Bowling: It Can Be A Crude Sport!,8,14 July 2006,"What a strange comedy this turned out to be. Of course, that's not a shock considering you have Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Bill Murray starring. Now there's a stable, conservative trio!! This actually has some very funny moments. At first I was afraid it was going to be too irreverent to the Amish - and there definitely was some of that with Quaid's character, who is made to look like a total dimwit, who has no knowledge of the Bible and is easily led - NO characteristics of an Amish person, BUT the film really isn't mean-spirited and it does show respect for the Amish in a number of scenes. However, it's still very much a sleazy film and the writers wouldn't have done this with any other non-Christian character.All the characters in here, including the profane female lead played by Vanessa Angel (who?), are fun to watch. The most outrageous, in a minor role, is the female landlord who has to be seen to be believed.Bowlers will especially like this film since a good part of it centers around that. A number of PBA members put it cameo performances. One scene, with the fake hand attached to the bowling ball as it returns from the ball rack had me almost in tears laughing, for some reason. Murray's take on the flamboyant bowler (and there have been a few over the years on the Pro Bowlers Tour) is hilarious.Crude, but a funny film for the most part.",Kingpin
6,rmax304823,Two Guys Walk Into a Bowling Alley....,6,22 April 2015,"This often-amusing piece of trash begins with a scene out of Paul Newman's ""The Hustler."" Bill Murray sees the latent bowling talent in Woody Harrelson, cultivates it, and they set out hustling small-town rubes. Harrelson pretends to be drunk and is faced with an impossible frame. Everyone bets against him and when he makes the spare, he and Murray split the money. That is, until finally some clot of rubes wakes up to the scam and grinds Harrelson's bowling hand off, while Murray cheerfully speeds off alone.A tragic tale. Harrelson is a real down-and-outer in Baltimore, forced to service his landlady in lieu of the rent. She has a face like Euryale the gorgon and he vomits voluminously after the bout.Then he gets a lucky break. He spots a young man, Randy Quaid, from a neighboring Amish town who has the same talented touch with a bowling ball, and persuades him to take to the road. They hustle their way to the million-dollar championship bowl off in Reno, Nevada, picking up some enemies along the way, not to mention Vanessa Angel. The two final contestants are Harrelson, bowling with his hook instead of his hand, and the egomaniacal Murray.I didn't think it was as inventive as ""There's Something About Mary"". There is no equivalent of Ben Stiller's arrest at the roadside tea room. Yet it is funny and it gets funnier as it meanders along. Some of the gags are silly and pointless -- the burly Quaid dressed in tights and doing a pole dance. But there's wit in some of the visual gags -- Harrelson bending over a cute baby, making goo goo sounds, and chucking it under the chin with his hook while the mother's eyes bulge with anxiety.And the dialog has its moments too. ""You know, you're not the most intelligent person on earth."" ""Oh, yeah, and who are you, Alfred Einstein?"" Then there are the performances, uniformly professional. We'll begin with Vanessa Angel. Yes, let's begin with her. The English-born actress has a mellifluous voice, a little throaty, and is strikingly attractive, a paragon of pulchritude. Oh, yum.Quaid is a large, clumsy actor but his role rather suits him -- the stolid, God-fearing, son of the soil, who takes his first automobile ride and shortly afterwards is taking hits from a long blue bong.Harrelson doesn't exactly have an actor's elocution. He has a weak voice and usually sounds as if he's reading his lines from some off-screen cue card. But he excels at light comedy, especially when the comedy has a slightly deranged quality, as it does here.Murray plays it straight at first but the final confrontation in Reno gives him a chance to unwind. He is absolutely hilarious, seen on television in a parody of one of those ad miseracordiam commercials for ""Unified Way"". ""Little Charlotte here has never eaten a hot dog in her life. She lives in poverty and depends on your donations to keep her alive."" Meanwhile, Murray is copping feels from the local mothers and daughters. I laughed out loud when Murray wept with joy at the prospect of beating Harrelson at the championship bowl off.I'm glad we see a little bit of what looks like Reno too. Reno is a pleasant, laid back little city. I've spent many cozy nights there at the elegant Mapes Hotel, sleeping in the lobby.",Kingpin
7,Quinoa1984,One of the funniest comedies of the 90's,8,24 March 2001,"Kingpin is a film that might not match up to the Farrelly Brothers masterpieces like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, but it comes close.  The movie stars Woody Harrelson as a once great bowling champ who's career is ended by an injury to his hand for which he must spend the rest of his life with a hook.  But then he finds a new kid, Amish, but promising bowling guy (Randy Quaid) and finds hope for a new future.  Sounds like the setup for a corny drama, but the Farrelly's take no wrong turns in delivering big belly laughs for the overall scope of the movie.  Harrelson, Quaid and even the seductress Vanessa Angel (you might remember her from TV's Weird Science) deliver good laughs, but it is two people who steal the show and make this film utterly hilarious- Bill Murray who gives a new meaning to the word comb-over, and Chris Elliot who gives one of the funniest moments in 90's comedy in a cameo.  A",Kingpin
8,BandSAboutMovies,Hey Pittsburgh,7,26 May 2020,"When I was a kid, Beaver Valley Bowl always seemed so intimidating. How strange then that it's the place where Roy Munson has his hand smashed and his bowling career ruined. I never had such a bad time there myself, but you always felt like something could go badly. That scene where they walk up the steps and Roys asks, ""People bowl here?"" They didn't fake a single thing about that place. It has always looked that frightening.Kingpin is filmed in and around the bowling alleys of Pittsburgh. You can see just about every major lane in the film, other than my favorite, the Hollywood Show Lanes inside Arsenal Lane with their giant photo of Telly Savalas, autographed with ""Who loves you, baby?""I'm sure that everyone has seen this movie, but you'd do well to watch it again and appreciate the magic that is Bill Murray in this movie. Every single moment he's on screen is perfect. That scene where he bowls three strikes in a row? That's real. He also ad libbed just about every line in the entire movie.It's worth remembering that before assassins began hunting down Randy Quaid, he was a pretty wonderful comedic actor. This is also probably one of the first times that many realized who Lin Shaye was.At one point, Michael Keaton was to play Munson, with Chris Farley as Ishmael and Charles Rocket as Big Earl. Jim Carrey was another choice to play the evil bowler.It's also worth noting that the character Seabass from Dumb and Dumber (played by Cam Neely) is a confirmed relative of this movie's Skidmark, who is Roger Clemens.Many of the lanes in this movie are gone. We'll always have this movie to remember them by.",Kingpin
9,Coventry,"Grab a seat, have a few beers...and start laughing !!",8,18 July 2003,"My favorite actor once wrote in one of his best movies "" All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" ... That's how I felt about this movie. I love a decent and serious drama or epic but sometimes I just feel like laughing silly and lower my brain activity. And Kinpin is one of the best films to do this. Sprung from the mind of the Farrelly brothers, this comedy about the bowling world is hilarious. Well acted by respectable actors and filled with great jokes and quote-material. Just the right doses of sentimental elements and (almost) never over the top. Back in 1979, Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was a very gifted bowler. Due to the bad influence of Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray in a great role) his bowling hand was mutilated by villains. Now 17 years later, Roy is a schmuck and a drunk. He meets the very naive Amish guy Ishmaël ( Randy Quaid ) who is a great bowling talent. Roy wants to take him to Reno where a bowling contest is held. At first Ishmaël doesn't want to cause it doesn't fit in his Amish way of life but when his fathers tells him the community needs money he finally agrees. The way to Reno and the search for money causes a lot of hilarious situations. They meet a gorgeous woman, Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and she joins them to their trip to Reno. All the actors give a terrific performance. All that Vanessa Angel has to do is being sexy, of course, but she does that like no other woman could. Randy Quaid is cast perfect in the role of the Amish son of a farmer. His naive way of life give us the funniest scenes in the movie. I'm a big fan of Woody Harrelson and I think he can handle comedy as good as the serious roles he played in Natural Born Killers and The People vs Larry Flint. OK, he was in the funny sitcom Cheers but the this is a whole other kind of comedy. The supporting roles are very good as well, and the landlady is the first that comes to mind. Great, I tell you !! This is my personal favorite of the Farrelly bros. Although I laughed very hard with Dumb & Dumber and Something about Mary too, this film has something special. I can't really explain what that is. Anyway, this film is highly recommended to everyone who can appreciate a good comedy and isn't easily offended. People may claim that it's vulgar, but I think that's rather relative. I think it's a lot less vulgar than those typical high school comedies like American Pie. It's more accessible for people too in my opinion.",Kingpin

11,jotix100,Bowling anyone?,8,25 August 2005,"Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the directors of ""Kingpin"" show a great flair for this type of comedy. Not having seen it when it first was released, we were lucky to catch it on cable the other night, and frankly, it proved to be a happy choice. The Farrellys had a good screen play by Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan to work with, as they showed a talent for assembling a wonderful cast to make this a winning comedy the fun and exciting film it is.The best thing in the film are Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray. Mr. Harrelson plays Roy Munson, the man who love bowling, but through an unfortunate incident, loses his ability to play the sport he was born to play. Woody Harrelson is wonderful in his portrayal of Munson. Bill Murray's role is much smaller, but he does wonders with it. Best of all is the way we see him at the bowling tournament in Reno with his teased hair in disarray.The rest of the cast is good. Randy Quaid as Ishmael Boorg, gives a funny reading of his naive character. Also the attractive Vanessa Angel plays the woman who has an interest in the game.",Kingpin
12,grantss,Don't be put off - it gets a lot better,6,2 October 2014,"I almost stopped watching this movie. The first 40 minutes or so are incredibly bad. Unfunny, gross-out toilet attempts at humour and silly, pointless plot.But then, from a point, it gets better. The jokes become cleverer and funnier. There is suddenly a depth to the characters and there is even a semblance of a plot.This all culminates in some great bowling scenes, with Bill Murray at his entertaining best.On that note, Bill Murray, while only being a supporting performer, is great in this movie and almost steals the show. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid give solid performances and Vanessa Angel adds the eye candy, but Murray takes the movie to another level. Another thing that keeps the movie going is the soundtrack. Great music, especially the outro by Blues Traveler.",Kingpin
13,Boba_Fett1138,Bill Murray is crazy!,9,2 March 2004,"This movie is one of my favorite comedies. There is a great cast, characters and story that are good for some serious laughs.The movie has a high pace and doesn't slow down for a moment which is in this case a positive thing. It also has as result that the jokes come very fast after each other, some are better than others of course but that's just a matter of taste and the good jokes make more than up for the bad ones.But strangely the strength of the movie is not in the jokes; It's in the casting. Woody Harrelson gives a top performance and he and Randy Quaid form an odd and because of that wonderful comical duo. But the show stealer is once again Bill Murray. He is crazy! Every scene with him in it is funny and he puts down yet another crazy character on the big screen.Further more, the story is filled with some crazy character that can only come out of the genius comical minds of the Farrelly brothers.An underrated comedy.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Kingpin
14,view_and_review,Bowling made funny,7,6 February 2007,"Of all the sports to make a movie about, bowling is probably just a tick better than darts, curling, and synchronized swimming; which is why this movie was so fantastic. They took a very boring, uneventful and unwatchable sport like bowling and made it into a fun movie. A lot of credit has to be given to the writers, because this movie was hilarious. But I guess laughs are what you get when you mix an Amish man, an old washed up bowler with one hand, and a hot looking gangster's girlfriend. Everyone of the main characters was funny: Woody Harrelson as Roy Munson, the has-been bowler that lost his hand after having it shoved into a bowling ball return machine. Randy Quaid as Ishmael Boorg, the quiet, naive Amish man just trying to do what is right. Vanessa Angel as Claudia, the beautiful rich gangster's girlfriend trying to escape. And who can forget Bill Murray as Ernie McCracken, the selfish, womanizing, kingpin bowler with a TERRIBLE comb over. The movie was just very funny all around.",Kingpin
15,AlsExGal,Roy was a great bowler...and then he got Munsoned,8,1 September 2019,"In 1979, to the tune of ""Disco Inferno"", Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) demonstrates that he is the greatest bowler in the world. Except nobody knows this but himself, his dad, and the rest of his small Iowa hometown. So he sets out on the open road to make his fame and fortune in the sport. And then he runs into HIM...Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray). Ernie talks Roy into running a scam with him on some other bowlers, basically a hustle, and when the scam goes bad, Ernie takes a powder and leaves Roy holding the bowling bag. And the scammed - including a preacher - do not take it well. They take revenge by putting Roy's bowling hand into the bowling ball return. You don't actually SEE the gore, but the next scene is Woody in present day (1996) stopping his morning alarm with his extremely fake looking prosthetic hand to the tune of ""It's a Beautiful Morning"".Roy's fortune looks like it might take a turn for the better when he encounters an Amish bowler, Ishmael (Randy Quaid), who has an incredibly high bowling score average. He wants Ishmael to go with him to a one million dollar tournament in Reno. Ishmael won't go because the bowling hobby is a secret from his family, one that his family and the entire Amish community consider sinful.So the rest of the film consists of a hilarious take on the Amish community - ever notice this is the LAST group of people that it is OK to make fun of?, a beautiful but unwanted passenger (Vanessa Angel), and another encounter with HIM - Ernie McCracken, now a successful pro bowler...who still has both of his hands.With Bill Murray as, well, Bill Murray. He's always the same character. We wouldn't want it any other way, at least in a comedy. Also with Lin Shaye as the woman with patent leather skin, an oversexed landlady who is playing the same kind of gross-out role she had in ""Something About Mary"". And about Roy being ""Munsoned"", along the way he learns that his last name has become an adjective, meaning ""to have the world in the palm of your hand and blow it"".Sure this film is full of juvenile jokes, but overall it is very funny, plays to the strengths of the cast, and is for everybody who feels like they blew an opportunity in life, which is just about all of us. It's a shame most of the critics at the time didn't get that.",Kingpin
16,anaconda-40658,No Gutter Balls Here.,10,21 July 2015,"Kingpin (1996): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel, Bill Murray, Lin Shaye: One of the best comedies of 1996. Woody Harrelson plays champion bowler Roy Munson who quests to regain the potential he once had. He was betrayed seventeen years prior, which resulted in his rubber hand. Unable to regain the spotlight, he sets his sights to train an Amish citizen who bowls in secret. They are eventually joined by Vanessa Angel who flees from an abusive relationship. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly who scored big with the very funny Dumb and Dumber but the screenplay here is tighter and much more detailed. It has effective sight jokes but more importantly it has an ending of unpredicted satisfactory. Harrelson plays off the desperation to be a winner and we can sense his pain and regret. Randy Quaid is hilarious as the gullible yet sincere Amish bowler who desires to champion his family during financial crises. Angel plays off toughness with vulnerability as she remains one step ahead of Munson. Bill Murray steals scenes as a competing bowler who betrayed Munson and displays no signs of remorse that isn't met with sarcasm. Lin Shaye makes a hilarious scene stealing cameo as Roy's angry landlord whose methods of payoff leave Munsion puking his guts out in a toilet. Hilarious comedy about restoration stamped with a rubber hand. Score: 10 / 10",Kingpin
17,FlashCallahan,You have a monkey?....,6,16 August 2012,"Roy Munson was the best bowler in the world. But a fellow bowler, Ernie McCracken and a misunderstanding with some rough punks, left Roy with the loss of his bowling hand.He gets a prosthetic hand and becomes a travelling salesman. But it's really all down hill for him from that night on until he meets Ishmael who is Amish and sneaks away from the farm to bowl.Roy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer and he'll make him the best bowler the world has ever seen.Reluctantly Ishmael agrees to go on the road and shortly afterwards actually finds that life outside the farm is quite fun. Soon their paths cross that of Ernie McCracken who is still a top ranking bowler.While Roy's career and life have landed in the toilet bowl, Ernie is still drawing huge crowds....Whilenot as good as Dumb and Dumber, the Farrellys comedy still felt pretty fresh and new for it's time of release.If this was released now, it wouldn't have has the plaudits is had, it would probably end up on late night TV, and wouldn't have the great cast.Harrelson is great as Roy, but cannot hold up to Quaid and a brilliant Murray, whenever they are on screen, the film really shines and becomes funny.Sadly, the rest of the film relies on horrid toilet humour and scenes that try and push the boundaries for a '12' movie, it doesn't work and the film has aged badly.That said, the hair is great in this movie, and while the Farrellys haven't really made a good original film for fourteen years, they proved with their first three movies they were a little left-field.",Kingpin
18,Aaron1375,"Funny movie, but tails off at the end.",8,17 March 2003,"I like this one about as much as I do ""There is Something about Mary"", unfortunately it didn't get near the revenue at the box office.  Still though I enjoyed it as I saw it at the theater.  I went to the theater to see this movie with my friend, but I really didn't want to see that movie so I thought I would give this one a try and I was pleasantly surprised as I had a good time at this one.  The story is a washed up bowler who lost his hand tutors an Amish guy who wants to save his farm.  The movie is very funny with jokes flying.  Unfortunately, it is a Farrelly brother movie so it has its dead spots of no humor.  Here the last 20 minutes of the movie loses the energy and pace the rest of the movie has and there are only a few chuckles to be had.  The cast is great as Quiad, Woody, and Vanessa Angel are great.  So is the small role of Bill Murry as a rival bowler.  All in all a very funny movie, that might have benefited if it was a bit shorter than it is.  Though it is worth checking out.",Kingpin

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,Great comedy,7,23 January 2007,"I have heard quite a bit about Kingpin, about how funny it is and how great the actors were together, this film was on the top 100 funniest films of all time and not to mention that I heard a lot about it from my friends. I thought that it was a pretty decent comedy that I had fun with, especially the finally bowling scene with Bill Murray, he was the one who truly stole this film. But the entire cast was so great and special, I think anyone could laugh a few times from this film.Roy has been brutally disfigured in a bowling game when his partner, Ernie, leaves him to a horrible disfiguration of getting his bowling hand cut off. Years and years later, he finds Ishmael Boorg, an Amish farmer who bowls extremely well, but he doesn't want his family to know that he can bowl, but after begging and begging, Ishmael decides to be with Roy in a huge tournament for a huge cash prize. Through the trip they make, they become the most unlikely of friends picking up a hot woman, Claudia.Kingpin is one of those films you don't forget and I will guarantee the minimum of one laugh, especially when you see these grown men have comb overs and are acting like little boys in the the competition together. I would recommend it for a fun afternoon with the friends, it's good film and it looked like the cast really had a lot of fun together.7/10",Kingpin
23,KineticSeoul,"Funny, but not downright hilarious",7,1 November 2009,"Roy Munson(Woody Harrelson) is a bowling prodigy and wins the 1979 Iowa state amateur championship and plans to leave his hometown to make it big by going on a Professional Bowlers Tour. But his dreams comes to a halt when he comes across Ernie McCracken(Bill Murray) who tricks Roy and uses him as a pawn while Ernie runs off with all the money he got from conning. The angry people that got conned takes there anger out on Roy, and he gets his hand amputated. Yrs later Roy who was a innocent boy has a hook for a hand now where he used to bowl with and is now a con man himself, since he is in debt with the landlady and soon is forced to have unwanted sex with her. But a ray of hope comes for Roy when he meets Ishmael who is a talented bowler himself and tries to recruit him for the $1,000,000 winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada. The thing is Ishmael is a Amish boy. This film was a bit darker than I expected and flows with some crude and rude humor, but it's actually quite funny at times, despite it being a bit dark. And the humor in this might offend some people even if it's not the most repulsive comedy out there or even comes close but since it sort of seem like a kid friendly comedy some may get offended. This is a funny road movie, that will keep you laughing or at least grinning in some scenes. It wasn't the most hilarious movie I ever seen but I got some good laughs out of it. The direction the creators went with this is ambiguous and isn't the stereotypical and predictable comedy, and the ending did not sit right with me and sort of made me angry. But it just shows the reality of life even if a lot of this film is down right outrageous. Soon Claudia(Vanessa Angel) is in the group as well, but I found her character more annoying than funny, she is a whore and that is the bottom line no matter what she does at the end. It just wasn't believable and it seemed like she had some other ulterior motives or just forced. I don't know about anyone else but I don't particularly think that a girl that constantly act like a hooker throughout the whole movie to be attractive. Plus in my opinion she has a butter face but maybe I am shallow. And to top it off she wasn't sexy even if some do disagree, she was only on the ride for the money and that is basically the main thing she saw at the end as well, cause her character change was just not believable. Especially since the characters are more serious compared to other comedies where the characters seem to be from another planet or just way too bizarre, stupid and retarded which sometimes adds to the comedic value, but that ain't the case for this film. I found how they turn any serious situation that are suppose to be dull into something funny which is a nice touch. Just about the entire cast was special and put on a great and funny performance. So it's a funny comedy with some crude and rude humor, just nothing downright hilarious and the comedy in this seemed a bit tacky sometimes.7.2/10",Kingpin
24,cherold,I have no idea why people like this unpleasant pseudo-comedy,3,20 April 2017,"I didn't like this movie from very early on. The usually reliable Bill Murray was more creepy than funny, and after an early, fairly unpleasant sequence, we move years into the future where Woody Harrelson is almost as creepy.The comedy comes in bits and starts. Some of it is pretty conventional humor, some is close to Airplane levels of silliness, but much of the movie isn't especially funny at all. I seem reviews here that say this movie is hilarious, and honestly, I couldn't even guess at the parts people found hilarious.The brightest spot was Randy Quaid, who had a pleasant goofiness and general likability. I kept thinking, maybe if I stick with this it will get funny eventually, but about two-thirds of the way through I decided to give up.I would never have guess the guys who made this would go on to make something as good as There's Something About Mary.",Kingpin
25,gridoon,Mostly unfunny.,4,16 September 2001,"Many people found this movie, the second outing from the Farrelly brothers, to be hilarious, but I thought the funny moments were few and far between. Most of the time, this is a depressingly UNfunny, occasionally tasteless farce, that follows, and supposedly spoofs, the ""Rocky"" and the road-movie formulas, and has references to other recent movies (like the ""Indecent Proposal"", in one inspired little bit). As for the ""offensive"" factor, it's pretty low, despite its being ""hyped-up""; the only really disturbing scene is the aftermath of a dreaded sexual encounter. Woody Harelson does give a decent and believable performance, though.  (*1/2)",Kingpin

28,CuriosityKilledShawn,"If you give a little, you can get back a who-ole lot more",9,6 June 2000,"In a rare instance of the UK getting a movie before the US, Kingpin was a surprisingly pleasant discovery on a Saturday afternoon back in the sunny July of 1996. It has since gone on to be one of my favorite comedies and showcases Bill Murray's evil, sarcastic humor at it's finest.Woody Harrelson is Roy Munson a young, up-and-coming bowler who falls foul of 'Big' Ern McCracken (simply by beating him). Ern executes a cunning revenge on Roy which results in the loss of his precious bowling hand. Flash-forward 17 years and Roy is living a truly grotty life and is a complete and utter loser. His hustling attempts fall flat and it looks like he's destined for a future of failure until he meets naive Amish 'boy' Ishmael, who just so happens to be a bowling prodigy. Roy and Ishmael team-up and head to Reno, Nevada for a big bowling showdown with the diabolical 'Big' Ern.Part road movie, part profound life journey, Kingpin is probably the most mature Farrelly Brothers movie and certainly their best effort so far. The script is just jam-packed with brilliant dialogue and gags, and Ishmael (or 'the kid' as they keep calling him despite the fact that Randy Quaid was 45 at the time of filming) may just be the sweetest character of all time and may even rival Cousin Eddie as Quaid's funniest role. But it is Bill Murray as 'Big' Ern who steals the movie and runs away with it. Apparently he just threw the script away and decided to ad-lib, and you can tell. He keeps the rest of the cast on their toes and enjoys himself way too much. His Unified Fund TV commercial is comedy gold.It may well be one of the most underrated comedies of all time, but Kingpin is a far superior film to the likes of There's Something About Mary or Me, Myself & Irene. It's lack of success or popularity is not a reflection on its brilliance.",Kingpin

Case or fate leads him to meet with Amish who sneaks out of his community to secretly bowl. Roy takes him under his own and trains him to beat his eternal rival on a big tournament.This silly sports adventure is very entertaining and at times hilarious, and the above-mentioned rivals are played by Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray, backed by Randy Quaid in the role of the bowling Amish and Vanessa Angel in the main female role. It's far from the masterpiece of the genre, but you'll surely have a good time.7/10",Kingpin
30,sol-,Let's Go Bowling,7,25 November 2017,"Strapped for cash, an injured former bowling champion hatches a cunning plan to coach a talented young man to lucrative tournament success in this lively comedy from the Farrelly Brothers. As per Farrelly norm, the film is littered with crude humour and childish gross-out gags. Also, as per the Farrellys' earlier 'Dumb & Dumber', there are one too many gags at the expense of a main character's naivety. 'Kingpin' is frequently funny throughout though with even some of the cruder puns (""we have a bull"") working well. Much of the film's success is due to how likable and empathetic Woody Harrelson is as the bowling champ whose life has gone downhill ever since his arm was severed. It is a character that could have easily been written as pathetic, but on the contrary, he is passionate and imaginative, going to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying the rent and to convince the talented young man (an Amish farmer) to take him on as coach. The film also benefits from Bill Murray at his funniest, some fun movie references ('The Graduate'; 'Indecent Proposal') and the way the story defies generic expectations and ends with loose ends as the fates of certain characters are not actually germane to the plot. And it is quite a warm tale that the film spins beneath its obscenities: a story of not giving up and the belief that all people can change.",Kingpin
31,johnnyboyz,Why filmmakers decide to mix sport with COMEDY is beyond me and Kingpin is a good example of why not to.,5,14 September 2007,"Something I've found with sports films is that the less funny they are, the better. When I say 'less funny', I mean when they're not attempting to be comedies. Some of the best sports films from down the years have been the ones that don't show sports as a joke; films that don't send up the sports and films that don't try to be funny. Raging Bull, The Hustler and The Colour of Money are amongst these examples with The Hustler and The Colour of Money particularly relevant examples. When it comes to humour in sports films, Happy Gilmore is probably the only one that I actually liked and which was supposed to be a comedy; odd how it too features a mentor with a false hand. Because of this, that means Kingpin is, in my opinion, a failure.This is quite a bump landing for Woody Harrelson who went from Natural Born Killers in 1994 to this junk with the mediocre but fun Money Train in between. Here, he doesn't play a cross country killer but a cross country bowling coach called Roy Munson as he coaches a protégé called Ishmael Boorg (Quaid). This is where the references to The Hustler and The Colour of Money come in  Kingpin is a failed and flawed version of these two films but with bowling replacing pool right down to the way the final tournament (in The Colour of Money) is started as each competitor simultaneously takes the first shot in their respective match.Kingpin has several basic things wrong with it that makes it disgusting, unfunny, badly paced and frustrating. I feel the biggest problem is the casting of Randy Quaid as the shy, innocent and all round good guy Ishmael. There's something I can't quite put my finger on that's wrong with it because the guy's delivery is flat and unfunny and the character in general is just too inconsistent. He's oblivious to the world despite his age yet can give monologues about life and how bad smoking is to people and inspire them to think differently. The fact he's also a complete idiot doesn't help the consistency of the character either. Also, the humour in Kingpin is rather pathetic yet at the same time, grotesque: the 'milking' of a bull scene was disgusting, the sex with the old landlady and the subsequent shots of Roy vomiting was uncalled for, the kissing of the elderly relative with the huge beard was nasty and topping it all of was Ishmael/Quaid himself dressed as some sort of drag queen stripper. None of this was funny or even pleasant to look at so you can imagine how very surprised I was when I realised that the script was actually written by someone over the age of ten.Kingpin tries to have a heart as it forces its protagonist to face former demons back at his home town about half way through. The reason these scenes are good is because the film isn't relying on dumb humour but also because the last time we were at these locations was in the opening which was very well done. The scenes of Roy as a boy bowling in is yard, the 1979 tournament and the way the camera and the disco music combines as he enters the alley is fun and very effective so how ironic that when Roy suffers his past tragedy, the film turns into a different type of beast. How very quaint that Roy also manages to give the definition of a mentor when he's trying to convince Ishmael to become his protégé without actually saying: 'I'll be your mentor'. Also, how very quaint that thanks to weak cause and effect a love interest manages to worm its way into the plot. Kingpin is perhaps fun for the first fifteen minutes but then misses the mark more times than it should with gross, unfunny humour; bad characterisation of the protégé and just a really bland feeling that it's trying too hard to be funny as well as tragic.",Kingpin
32,leplatypus,Maybe a strike (vhs),7,16 July 2017,"I took the movie when the Weird Science babe, Vanessa Angel, comes to screen and this little bit was funny: I liked how the cast laughs about their physics and looks (frozen and beaten tits, beer belly and Amish look): Randy Quaid is always cool playing the gentle idiot and whatever, Vanessa is a real beauty who can take charge: so, it's a rare American comedy that actually gives smiles and i wish i could watch it from start to finish!",Kingpin
33,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Very clever and rather original slapstick comedy,7,19 July 2008,"It's not hard to imagine the kind of comedy you're going to get from a film that combines amateur bowling washouts, rubber prosthetics and the Amish. That's what ""Kingpin"" delivers: Lots of gags and quirky, dumb characters. Impressively enough, however, the Farrelly brothers make slapstick feel fresh in this film with tons of obscene, crude and even plain old disgusting humor. This not a film for those who find no humor in stupid, for those who do, ""Kingpin"" is a very enjoyable film.Woody Harrelson stars as Roy Munson, the 1979 Iowa amateur bowling champion whose life goes south when he gets cheated by Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and it costs him his bowling hand. 17 years later he meets Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) in a bowling alley and sees an opportunity to turn his life around. After convincing Ishmael to leave his Amish community, the two set forth for Reno's $1 million bowling tournament, teaming up with Claudia (Vanessa Angel) along the way.This is a cross-country (Pennsylvania to Reno) comedy adventure where each scene has a bunch of obvious gags, but they're clever (not overused) and usually short and sweet instead of drawn out. That, and the Farrelly brothers also supply some ""unspoken"" humor like Roy and Ernies' hair flying in several directions throughout the film. So there ends up being a lot to laugh about in this film, which helps a lot with the sort of aimless plot.Harrelson and Quaid are great in the film, though Billy Murray is the actor who really takes this film to the next level. The film's climax is all about utilizing his talents as a comedian and he helps make an okay scene (the climax to an aimless plot) way more tolerable to get through. The rest of the cast is pretty bad with the exception of Lin Shaye as Harrelson's landlady, a scene which deserves no spoilers. Angel is pretty terrible (other than her looks). She lets her British accent slip out a lot and I didn't know she was from the UK before I watched this film.This is a great movie in you're in the mood for some really creative silliness.

This is the Farelly's unfunniest movie, even though unfunniest isn't a word. It almost took a year to hit video, which angered me more. The moments of laughs that are scarce as shark sightings, actually came as a relief in a near two hour movie, you just couldn't give two hoots about. Harrelson, a bowler with promise who was robbed of his golden moment, as well as his bowling hand, hits back years later, teaming up with the most likely of partners, an insecure Amish man, played by character actor, Randy Quaid, this unfunny mess of a comedy, not the first film, he's been wasted in. They also met a hot pro, with a nice heart, on the run from some bad guys, (yeah, shades of Dumb and Dumber) where a romance blossoms between her and Harrelson. Harrelson returns to the bowling scene, getting back at his nemesis, Murray, in fine devious form, an actor you have to witness to appreciate his method. This too long film, although Quaid, is fun to watch, is just an opposite misfire to the Farelly Brother's former hit.

Harrelson actually surprised me with his performance herein. I do not know what I expected really, but his performance surpassed those unknown expectations. Randy Quaid is so not Amish that it was amusing watching him as a man who is not Amish, trying to pretend to be Amish, convincingly, and not. But he did not mean to be convincing. It's merely the tenor of his performance which makes you half buy into his Amishness (if you can dig it).The weakest element here was Bill Murray. I hate to say that, as I have been a fan for thirty years, or so, but he is not nearly as great as his ego makes him believe, and his arrogance in this vehicle lost its humor when the character's megalomania too closely approached his own, thereby rendering the character a non-character in my book, and negating his performance as a performance.All in all, this is amusing, but not highly so, and is seriously overrated by the users here at IMDb.

For Bobby and Peter Farrelly, putting message in a movie would be something they would do later, because at the days of (Dumb & Dumber - 1994) and (There's Something About Mary - 1998), they were in the dumb zone, playing the adolescent game of who can come up with dirtier stuff than the other?! They were determined not to make nice time, only an ocean of sperms & spews which stands for nice time for them! If being a comedy means making me laugh, then this one didn't make me laugh or smile. Instead, it made me feel how sickening that was, how easy making nauseating comedies is, and how scary culture might degenerate.

However, Munson believes his luck is about to change when he discovers there is a competition in Reno where first prize is $1,000,000. Due to his injury, Munson doesn't want to compete and by chance he stumbles across a shy Amish man called Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who shows a real talent for bowling. Believing that Ishmael is the perfect ticket to win the money, Munson befriends Ishmael and the two men set off on a journey that neither man is likely to forget.The Farrelly brothers show in this film (and with the original Dumb and Dumber film) that they could still make films that were funny and fairly good natured. Yes like Dumb and Dumber some of the humour is a bit crude (it's a Farrelly brothers after all), but for me most of the funny moments revolve around Ishmael's naivety when Munson pulls him into the 'real' world outside of his Amish community. It perhaps also helps that Randy Quaid gives an absolute stellar performance and does an excellent job at captivating this vulnerability. It does feel a bit mean-spirited at the start, but the bond and respect that develops between the two men is quite touching and the film has a lot more heart than I thought it would.The only minor issue I had with this film is that the narrative is a bit aimless and meandering. I got the impression that a lot of the scenes in the middle could have been edited and that the whole film could have been cut to around the 90 minute mark (which probably would have made it a bit more enjoyable). However, this is a minor quibble and Kingpin more than makes up for it with the big laughs that are on offer here. Randy Quaid was the star of the show here, but Harrelson and Murray were both excellent as well. The supporting cast were also good and Vanessa Angel looks great here.Kingpin plods and drags its heels at times, but it's a fine film with great performances, lots of heart and many very funny moments.",Kingpin

41,AudioFileZ,So Good It Elevates Politically Incorrect Comedy To Shakespearian Levels,8,15 December 2019,"If there is a category for college alternative movies, like music, I nominate the Farrelly Brothers. They're just ""off"" enough that their humor while often silly is whip-smart wicked funny. That means these guys are deftly talented. They can take liberties that in lesser hands would likely fall flat even being offensive. Instead they masterfully manipulate stupid and offensive into hilarious comedy as their debut with Dumb and Dumber hit big proving. So here we have a similar formula of two uncool guys on a wacky adventure Smartly, however, they are not even close in disposition and are serendipitously brought together by the most uncool sport on planet earth: professional bowling. These little differences make King Pin a superior film to the mega-successful Dumb & Dumber.In King Pin amidst all of the possibly sharply barbed satire there is a real heart of humanity. It hovers at different times and makes an excellent sum in the unexpected ending. I always love the Farrelly Brothers pop music sound tracks and it's excellent here. They often weave in overlooked gems that are so cool and well placed. When a soundtrack elevates the proceedings it actually affects the storyline masterfully. Speaking of masterfully. Woody Harrelson plays his role of Munson so well it appears we're seeing an actual person as the actor melts into the part. It is exceptional to do this with the portrayal of a downer character playing comedy wrapped in equal parts spiraling down and barely hanging on all the while retaining a sliver of hope. Munson as a character does all this for which you can't help love the loser. What's a loser without an evil foil? That is provided in superlative fashion by none other than the slimy comedic excellence of Bill Murray as profession bowling's reining kingpin ""Big Ern"". I simply cannot imagine this working so well without Bill Murray's role. He's an absolutely perfect slime ball. Then there's the glue which binds these character's together and it's Randy Quaid. Quaid playing the Amish ""kid"" turns in one of his finest portrayals of a character, ever. Whatever happened to him in later life he had acting chops to play an utterly ridiculous role and do so in such a natural way it seems, again, that the actor faded into a very real misfit. Vanessa Angel as the femme fatale is so right her unlikely pairing with Munson and ""The Kid"" never feels wrong in spite of it being wholly unthinkable. What's happening here?

42,a_chinn,The crass breakout Farrelly Brothers comedy still holds up,7,12 July 2018,"I saw this back in the day in the theater at a midnight showing and loved it. ""Kingpin"" was a box office disappointment upon it's original release, but it found it's audience on home video and became something of a cult classic. The set-up is basically ""The Natural"" except instead of a 1920s Robert Redford having his baseball career cut short, we have a 1970s Woody Harrelson's promising professional bowling career cut short. Harrelson resurfaces 20 something years later to mentor an Amish bowling prospect, Randy Quaid, in order to get payback against bowling star Bill Murray, who was responsible for Harrelson's career ending bowling injury. Suffice to say, it's not the story that made this film memorable. It's the many over-the-top hilarious gags and some surprisingly earnest characters that make this film still hold up today. Some of he best gags involve Harrelson's rubber hand, the foul mouthed Lin Shaye, Harrelson trying to pass as Amish, Quade getting some cold drinks, and an odd Indecent Proposal sequence involving a cameo by Chris Elliott, but it's really Bill Murray who steal every scene that he's in, whether he's mugging after losing a bowling match, doing a self serving infomercial, or something as small as his bad hair combover, he is absolutely hilarious in what might arguable be his best comedic performance (and that's saying something). It's really too bad Murray's part is a supporting role, but it may be his limited screen time that makes his performance so special. Writer/directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly had previously made the popular (and I believe critically underrated) ""Dumb and Dumber,"" but it was this film that helped pave the way for the slew of raunchy 90s comedies that followed, such as ""American Pie,"" the Farrellys own ""There's Something About Mary,"" all the way up to ""Superbad."" The 80s certainly had it's fair share of Porky's inspired raunch, but this new generation is a bit more story and character driven than their sleazier 80s counterparts. The main weakness of ""Kingpin"" is that the sappy maudlin elements of the story, which do certainly make the characters more empathetic, are often incongruous with the raunchy and absurd comedic elements. It's hard to go from Harrelson ""milking"" a bull or ""paying"" his rent to his hideous landlady to caring whether he finds redemption and self respect. However, ""Kingpin"" remains an enjoyably crass and rude comedy that although not be for all tastes is a hilarious treat if you can get into the spirit of the film.

44,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It's produces chuckles from time to time,6,15 June 2014,"Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't have much of a filmography but after they produced Dumb & Dumber (1994), they were pretty much set. Since this week was the recent release of the Farrelly brothers' long awaited sequel to Dumb & Dumber (1994), Dumb & Dumber To (2014), it seemed appropriate that we visit another early Farrelly brothers' work. I was amazed to see that this is the only time Woody Harrelson collaborated with these directors. After being in and proving in other films that he still can be a comedic actor, I thought he would've made another movie with them. Guess Harrelson has had other plans since.Here, Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson, a bowling prodigy who worked hard at being the best. That is, until one day after making a dangerous gamble, he loses his best bowling hand. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed, he leaves home to live a secluded life from society with poor living conditions and unkempt neighbors. Struggling to maintain any kind of order in his life, especially after losing his hand, he stumbles upon an Amish man named Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who reminds him of his youth and realizes that he has some unrecognized bowling skills and decides to take him under his wing. Along their travels, the two also stumble into a abusive rich man's wife that decides it's time for her to get out. The actress playing this vixen is Vanessa Angel. This is also probably her most memorable role in her filmography to most people who recognize her.The three actors do have their moments that are funny but it's not often. Harrelson carries most of the weight because of how his character tries to be better than his current social status. Quaid's character isn't all that funny but does work occasionally too. Of course, Angel's character is one that probably won't be ignored since much of the physical humor is centered around her bosom. Thankfully, not all the physical comedy relies on Angel. Harrelson's character uses a rubber hand in replace of his metal hooks and watching him fiddle getting ready or doing other things people normally do with their hands brought up some laughs. However there are some gags that are more gross than comical. I'm sure that's apart of the Farrelly humor, but if you're a viewer who doesn't like that kind of humor, it won't be that funny.Bill Murray even has a fairly major role in the story too, playing a bowler named Ernie McCracken. Man does Murray's hair get wild. In fact, his personality altogether is a bit too wild. Murray is more of an actor who can play a funny role in a deadpan fashion, not over-the-top. Most likely Murray fans will have a fun time but he does get to be too much at times. The two gentlemen behind the screenplay have more TV series writing under their belts than acclaimed comedy blockbusters, which could explain why several gags amount to very little. Also the characters for what they are, aren't the most likable. Yes, they're weird in their own way and have their moments, but they don't come off as characters that viewers would remember easily.Shockingly, a number of the less important characters are extremely blind or stupid. The character of Ernie McCracken is vulgar along with his strong hubris. McCracken gropes women in public and yet no one sees this? How is it that the women being groped is OK with this? It's not like McCracken is Elvis or something. One character even called the man ""a role model for future generations"". Are you kidding? Of course it's supposed to make the McCracken character seem unstoppable but how do these people not see this on public television? It may baffle viewers. Editing and cinematography is OK but nothing special. One time composer Freedy Johnston's score was barely noticeable. Much of the time, the music was provided by music parodying or directly paralleling the situation being displayed. It was alright at points, while others not so much.The comedy is frequently hit or miss, with its forgettable characters and repetitive gags. Woody Harrelson is the key to what helps makes watchable though.",Kingpin
45,Gislef,It's Okay...,6,21 June 1999,"I wasn't that impressed by the movie.  There were certainly funny moments, but sometimes they went for obvious laughs (i.e., Munson's hand coming off during his opening frame in Reno), where you can see it's coming and it's _still_ not funny.  Bill Murray and Randy Quaid seem to be having fun overacting, but Vanessa Angel is pretty much a non-entity, demonstrating here why Weird Science - The TV Show is probably going to be the pinnacle of her career.  Harrelson basically plays an unlikeable bastard.It also strikes me that the ending is somewhat flawed.  Even in most slob-type comedy movies, isn't there a requirement that the bad guy get his comeuppance?  The only ""triumph"" of the climax we're so divorced from that through most of the movie that there's no impact when we find out about it.When the gags click, they're very funny.  The whole Amish community sequence in the beginning is hilarious.  However, there's an awful lot of blank space or duds between the gags that do work.Overall, Kingpin is relatively funny, but it's not as insightful as Ferris Bueller, nor does it spit out the gags the way that Airplane! does.",Kingpin
46,Howlin Wolf,Gets better as it goes along.,8,28 November 2001,"This is a comedy that at the start threatens to become overburdened by - of all things - a plot.  Too much time is spent on developing the characters and manouvering them into the situation that will become the driving force of the movie.  About halfway through, when all of this has been done, the movie's tone finally settles down into a steady stream of gags.  The rewards that follow make it well worth the effort of sticking with it during the opening.  There are at least three jokes over the running time that deserve to be recognised as all time classics, if not more.   As has so often happened, the Farrelly brothers have managed to extract creditable performances from all four leads.  Bill Murray steals the show, but then, I don't think I've ever seen a movie where he hasn't.  The guy is a comedy legend, 'nuff said.  Quaid manages to imbue a real sensitive sweetness into what would otherwise be just a stupid character.  Ishmael IS stupid, but he's stupid with a heart of gold, and the Farrelly brothers again manage to handle the material with enough sensitivity that most moviegoers will be shocked, but not necessarily offended.   This, ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" are the Farrelly brothers' GOOD movies.  ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is not in the same class.",Kingpin
47,KUAlum26,I Haven't laughed THIS hard at the movies too often,9,22 July 2006,"Young Roy Munson has been raised to be a bowler.It's what he does best. In 1979,at the age of eighteen,Roy(Woody Harrelson from here on out)is at the top of his game and a bona-fide star in his Ohio hometown. After he beats Ace pro Ernie""The Big Ern""McCracken(Bill Murray,smarmy and snarkly as ever)in a match,he is raked into Ernie's con game and pays a dear price for it.Seventen years later,Roy is anything but the local hero he once was. He lives in a seedy apartment in small town Pennsylvania,does odd sales jobs and has to ""satisfy"" his decrepit landlady to avoid the rent. It's at one of the bowling alleys that Roy does routes to that he witnesses one Ishmael Boorg(Randy Quaid,backing his scene stealing performance in ID4 with this bravura turn),a sweet,gentle Amish man-child who has a natural knack for bowling. Needing money and smelling a chance at scoring big time,Roy decides to take Ishmael under his wing.On the way to a Million dollar tournament in Las Vegas,Roy and Ishmael pick up a comely stowaway and ally in a gangster's moll(VAnessa Angel) and bond from mishap to mishap.There's nothing particularly brilliant or especially sharp about this offering,the second from the brothers Farrelly,but its uniqueness and lack of restraint on the gross-out humor make this movie a very easy watch(for those who love that kind of stuff,of course). Harrelson,Quaid,Murray and Angel move effortlessly through this flick,which may explain why it's so good. Since this film,the Farrellys have steadily moved away from the almost merciless gross-out gags of their films and has made seeing their films a little less riotous and fun,so this movie is a healthy reminder of what a little imagination(I mean,honestly...a movie about Bowling AND the Amish?)and mischief can make. A great cheap rent or cable TV movie.",Kingpin
48,Sirus_the_Virus,"Perhaps not The Farrelly Brother's best, but hilarious.",8,28 August 2009,"Roy Munson is a character that you think you're gonna like but don't then do again. Munson is played by the great Woody Harrelson. Kingpin is a movie that with some of the characters, you think you're not gonna like but you do anyways. Like with Claudia(Vanessa Angel). she seems nice at first, then turns into a bitch, then turns into a user, then redeems herself in the end. Kingpin is a hilarious comedy from The Farrelly Brothers(Dumb & Dumber, which I love, and There's something about Mary, Which I also love). This is the second film by The Farrelly Brothers and by their second film they proved how great they were. The Farrelly Brothers still do good movies now days. Kingpin is a movie that I never would've given a chance. But I bought it because I wanted to see what it was like. This was a couple of months ago. I laughed incredibly hard. There are many hilarious scenes in Kingpin including a fight between Vanessa Angel and Woody Harrelson. There are a lot of great performances by Bill Murray. Bill Murray isn't in it that much, but the scenes that he is in funny. If you weren't satisfied with The Big Lebowski(You have to be high if you weren't), then see Kingpin.The Plot: Famous bowler Roy Munson's life is destroyed when a fellow enemy bowler rats him out after they scammed some bowlers. Years later, Munson is a loser living by himself with a hook and has a bald spot.

50,lambiepie-2,"This film is rude, crude and very funny",10,19 November 2002,"When this film first came out, I had no use for it. Then I was home sick one day and caught it on cable. I laughed my butt off. This is a crude, rude and down right funny film. It also helped that I grew up near the Pennsylvania Dutch and plenty of bowling lanes. Two seemingly safe areas that the Farley brothers attack it without mercy. Sometimes it gets down right disgusting and many cannot stomach, but overall, its very funny.Bill and Woody were funny as anything. The Disco-era beginning makes me laugh like crazy. The commercial Bill Murray does is to die for. This film will offend alot of people, and many references played for humor may make folks feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. If you are easily offended, this is NOT the film for you. But for everyone else who likes rude, crude and deviously funny -- often at the expense of others kinda humor, this is a gem to see.",Kingpin
51,mattymatt4ever,Hit or miss,6,6 May 2002,"""Kingpin"" is a harmless but overall unsatisfying comedy from the Farrelly Brothers.  The premise is great, and it's nice how the Farrellys didn't let the gag involving Woody's rubber hand run its course, but it could've been handled much better.  I still have no clue why Roger Ebert voted it as one of the funniest comedies ever.  There are gags that work, and there are also gags that don't.  And there are lapses of dullness between each gag.  The cast is good.  You can probably recognize certain Farrelly regulars like Lin Shaye and Chris Elliott.  Woody Harrelson is terrific in the lead role. Then again, Woody never ceases to please.  Randy Quaid is a perfect choice as the dim-witted Amish bowler.  Vanessa Angel is great to look at, though her accent noticeably drifts at times.  One thing I do have to criticize Peter and Bobby Farrelly for--and this even pertains to their good movies--is they always choose dorky music for their soundtracks.  I liked the hip opening, set to ""Disco Inferno,"" but from then on it's nothing but depressing easy listening tunes that only your grandparents enjoy listening to.  Did they forget they were making a comedy???  We need something a tad more upbeat.  The only cast member I can say was wasted was Bill Murray.  He tries to get a few chuckles, playing an ultimately mean-spirited character, and he has very little screen time.  I'm not placing the blame on Murray, I'm placing the blame on the screenwriters.  If he had some good material, his appearance would've been more memorable. There are only 3 scenes that made me laugh out loud, one being the hilarious barn-raising scene where Woody lets go of the ropes and the barn comes toppling down.  Now, I don't exactly think the Farrelly's are ""comic geniuses,"" but they have talent, which doesn't fully show in this hit-or-miss comedy.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Kingpin
52,Beta_Gallinger,"There certainly are laughter-inducing scenes, but it's no ""Dumb & Dumber""",6,4 March 2010,"This was the Farrelly brothers' (Peter and Bobby) follow-up to their 1994 theatrical debut, ""Dumb & Dumber"". I first saw ""Kingpin"" in 2000, four years after its release, and again in 2003. I didn't like it at all either time, and it might have been even worse for me the second time than the first, really leaving a bad taste in my mouth. After that, I obviously hoped never to see the movie again, but that eventually changed. Seeing ""Dumb & Dumber"" twice in 2007 and liking it both times was probably major reason for that. Over six and a half years since my second viewing of this follow-up, I've finally watched it for the third time, and the first time without anyone in the room with me. This was after watching Peter and Bobby's 1998 smash hit, ""There's Something About Mary"", which really left me puzzled about that film's appeal. I can't deny that watching ""Kingpin"" again was definitely better than the first two times I saw it, above average this time, but it still wasn't always funny.Roy Munson grows up bowling, learning how to play the sport from his father at an early age. In 1979, he becomes a professional, but doesn't get very far, as fellow pro bowler Ernie McCracken gets him to participate in a bowling hustle, which leads to the amputation of Roy's right hand, the one he bowls with, by a group of thugs! Seventeen years later, he has not bowled since then, and has been drinking a lot. He has prosthetic hook and a rubber hand to wear over it. For a living, he sells bowling alley equipment, but is not very successful and struggles to try and pay his rent to his scary landlady. However, one day, after failing to make a sale, Roy sees a man bowling at the alley who seems to have a lot of potential. This man's name is Ishmael Boorg, and he lives in a nearby Amish community. He has secretly come to this alley to bowl, even though it goes against Amish beliefs. Roy comes to the Boorg home disguised as an Amish man to try and convince Ishmael to enter a tournament in which the winner will get $1,000,000. After Ishmael learns that his community's land will soon be taken unless they come up with $500,000, he agrees to take part in this tournament for a good cause, with Roy as his manager. On their trip, they are soon joined by Claudia, the abused girlfriend of a ruffian named Stanley, and also meet up with Ernie McCracken, Roy's sleazy rival from 1970's who is still a popular professional bowler, unlike him! The first time I saw this second Farrelly brothers movie, I think it looked promising around the beginning, but in the end, I was not impressed. I'm not sure what I thought around the beginning the second time, but the third time, it seemed nothing more than mediocre at first. However, I found that it eventually improved slightly, and there were some very funny gags through the film's run, as well as some mildly amusing ones I guess. One highlight I can think of is the staged mugging, and Roy's landlady catching him with the man who posed as the mugger. A memorable gross-out gag (something the brothers are renowned for) is the lead character throwing up after having sex with his landlady to pay her, and the landlady saying things that make him throw up more. I know it's juvenile, but I thought most of this scene was amusing the third time. I laughed a number of times during the rest of the film, sometimes with the awkward relationship between Roy and Ishmael, and some of the things Ishmael does on the trip, such as acting as a female stripper and waking up with tattoos! Unfortunately, despite all the funny parts, the film isn't quite consistent enough with the gags, plus I found some parts perhaps a little too mean-spirited, and I don't think the film features the greatest comedy characters I've ever seen.Lots of modern-day comedians/comedy filmmakers are known for their crude humour, with lots of jokes involving sex and bodily functions, and the Farrelly brothers are among these. It's a type of comedy some people can't stand, but I think it can be really funny, and that may sometimes be the case in ""Kingpin"", though not as much as it is in ""Dumb & Dumber"". This 1996 bowling comedy doesn't have as much appeal as its predecessor, nor can it match the appeal of ""There's Something About Mary"", another 90's Farrelly brothers comedy. I know most people would probably disagree with this, but I personally think this film comes somewhere in between the other two in terms of quality. At least this one doesn't have any gag as disturbing as the genital/zipper one in the 1998 box office smash! Then again, I've never seen ANY other gag that disturbing! To me, ""Kingpin"" could have been much more consistent with the laughs, but if you're old enough to watch it and like crude humour, I won't say skip it. It would probably help if you're a fan of the sport the film focuses on as well.",Kingpin
53,aciessi,Bowled Me Over,9,23 March 2020,"Funny movies are good for these trying times. Kingpin is really funny movie. It's from The guys who made Dumb and Dumber, yet it has more in common with Airplane! The Farrelly Bros. didn't just bring their all with this, they threw in the kitchen sink. Kingpin is a laugh a minute kind of movie, and though so much time has gone by, the laughs still stick. It's high caliber, low-brow comedy, as the Farrelly Bros. so wonderfully mastered. It's also home to one of the all time greatest Bill Murray performances. Ernie McCracken is the Ron Burgundy of bowling, and i wouldn't have mind seeing his spin-off. It would have been a lot better than what they just recently did with The Jesus from The Big Lebowski. Yikes.",Kingpin

At least it's not golf. Really, how good can a comedy about a crippled bowler be?"" Still, I reasoned that this film is by the Farrelly brothers and it's about to come off streaming, so at least I should give it a try. Just goes to show how wrong a guy can be. A perfect mixture of sentiment and low and somewhat higher-brow humor, not to mention flawless performances and brilliant cinematography. A totally pleasant surprise. Definitely a new American comedy classic.",Kingpin
55,tbills2,"Roy Munson is a Hero, a Gen-u-ine Hero",7,16 January 2014,"Kingpin's way up there among my favorite comedies, now, let's see, well, um, there's Dumb & Dumber (which was made by the Farrelly brothers & is my undisputed favorite comedy), there's Me, Myself & Irene (that was made by the Farrelly brothers), There's Something About Mary (made by the Farrelly brothers), and Shallow Hal (the Farrelly bros), Stuck On You, too (the Farrelly brothers made it!), aaaaaaaaand, oh yeah, Kingpin (made by, who else, the Farrelly brothers!). Wow, the Farrelly brothers make truly great comedies, don't they? These two brothers are incredibly funny as well as incredibly talented too. There's Something About Mary and Dumb & Dumber, I mean, those two alone. Those two alone are two of the best comedies ever made! And Kingpin is not too far behind them. Kingpin is just about the funniest movie. I love it. It's so good and funny all the way through.Woody Harrelson is simply golden as Roy Munson, former state champion bowler. Roy Munson is a tragically lovable soul. Woody is a real good and funny guy himself. Randy Quaid is hilarious as Ishmael. Randy Quaid was meant to do comedy; he really shines on screen. Vanessa Angel is gorgeous as Claudia. Vanessa is really so smoking hot in Kingpin. Her outfits that she wears, oh my God, they're too much. I tell ya, if I was given the power to create a beautiful woman all from scratch, you know, out of thin air, like with my computer or something, while I'm wearing a bra on my head, I am pretty sure that I'd create Vanessa Angel. She's unbelievable. (Note to self, go buy Weird Science DVD boxset immediately, is that available?) Listen, I don't want to make this entire review all about how hot Vanessa Angel is (oh wait, no, yes I do), but let me just say, I crush hard on Vanessa. She's something special. Somehow, I don't think that I'm alone.Kingpin is one classic comedy. If you can't believe me, just go watch it yourself, I mean, there's so much to laugh at! I gotta rate Kingpin a 7 but a strong 7, I mean, it's like honestly a 7.998, just barely under an 8, and mostly due to its story not being meaningfully heartfelt enough, that's the point I'm trying to make, Kingpin isn't meaningfully heartfelt enough to be a great 8, but it's oh so close. I love Kingpin, like I say, it's one of my favorite comedies. So all in closing, let me again say, I love Kingpin, Woody Harrelson is great, Roy Munson is a genuine hero, the Farrelly brothers are incredible, Randy Quaid's hilarious, Vanessa Angel is deeply hot, and Kingpin is way, way freaking laugh-out-loud funny! Go see for yourself! Thank you!(Oh and also, I about forgot, there's this one other man who is in Kingpin, he goes by the name, Bill Murray, and Bill's about the funniest, sweetest guy on the planet, and in Kingpin, Bill plays Ernie McCracken, who's like, the funniest, meanest guy on the planet)",Kingpin

If it was something they knew it was how to make comedy that was sometimes downright nasty, but still with so much heart and love for their characters. Lately they've lost that touch (as well as almost all the other qualities they had), but this movie is still one of my favorites from their golden age.Actually i would rate this as their best film along with ""Something About Mary"" which says a lot. The story in Kingpin is nothing spectacular, but the actors all seem to enjoy themselves. Randy Quaid is awesome as the unwilling bowling Amish, Woody Harrelson great as his con-man manager and finally Bill Murray is as usual brilliant as the antagonist. Just like most of the work from the Farrelly-brothers this movie constantly uses cheap tricks and nasty comedy to get laughs from the audience. Often below the belt, often mean, but always with a tongue-in-cheek that makes it work.When it comes to the combination bowling and comedy, this is number one next to ""The Big Lebowski"".

Roy pays his rent and they both give money out of their checks to Ishmal and his community to save the area. This is a historic comedy and the humor is just classic.

72,steiner-sam,"At many levels this is a tasteless, but parts of it are funny",5,31 May 2021,"It's a comedy primarily set in 1996, with a few early scenes from 1969 and 1979.The story follows Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson), a promising bowler who wins the Iowa state championship as an amateur in 1979. His career ended when caught hustling with Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and ending up with his bowling hand amputated. Seventeen years later, Ernie is the top bowler in the country, and Roy is a drunk. Roy discovers Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), a naïve Amishman with bowling skills.Ishmael's Amish family needs money, so Ishamael agrees to go to a winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada, in hopes of winning $1 million. Along the way, they pick up Claudia (Vanessa Angel), a stereotyped bimbo with an attitude. In Reno, they reencounter Ernie McCracken.At many levels, this is a tasteless, sometimes gross, comedy. If you're in the mood for it, parts of it are pretty funny. At other times, it feels like they're hurrying through one joke to get to the next one in case the last one didn't land. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it's not memorable either.As for Ishmael and his Amish family, there's not much to say. Outside of the plain clothes, there's little effort to match reality. Most of the beards looked fake. Many of the women didn't have cape dresses. The Amish rock band at the end made no sense. The premise that Ishmael was going to be a missionary made no sense, as Amish don't have missionaries. One could go on, but then the movie wasn't trying to be realistic.",Kingpin

The story is about an ex-champion from bowling Roy (Woody Harrelson) who due to the influence of a magnificent Bill Murray ripped off people by telling them he was an amateur while in fact he's the king of the bowling...but good songs never last long and as some people took revenge, the king of bowling is now a sort of Captain Hook as he lost a hand. The rest of Roy's career is just a sum up of alcohol till he meet the hilarious Ishmael (Randy Quaid). Ishmael is a complete stranger to this world as whole his life he lived in a Jewish community that even don't know the existence of a hotel.... All what follows then are ultrahilarious situations in where Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Bill Murray play one of the best roles in their lives...almost every joke is superb, especially the part in where Roy (Harrelson) is offered 1 million dollar by a millionaire if he may sleep with Ishmael...of course this refers to his role in ""Indecent Proposal"".

74,patriciogl10,A comedy that bowls you over with fun.,6,25 October 2019,"If you're ever feeling in the mood for something straight out funny and direct, you may try Kingpin. As it is a story about an outsider to the world of bowling that suddenly finds himself in a place no one ever thought he'd be. And on the other side of the coin there is a former player who has seen past his glory days and gets the miraculous oportunity for a much-desired comeback. Then you put Randy Quaid and Woody Harrelson, the Farrelly brothers on the directors' chair and you got yourself a great recipe for comedy. The comedic flow of the film is rather consistent, moving from funny situation to the next; with Ishmael's naivety and Roy Munson's street smarts the duo grows exponentially funny as approaching the climax of the film, it's rather obvious but it still evokes a warming comical sense of familiarity, which all comedy films should provoke.I should not forget that Bill Murray plays Roy's sleazy rival, a part for which he absolutely marvels anyone who watches him. Just for him alone you don't want to miss this wonderful comedy.",Kingpin

After 17 years he meets Ishmael(Randy Quaid) an Amish who secretly bowls at the local shack and of course takes him under his wing the only way the Farrely Brothers know how. The movie is hilarious the whole way and even though could of risked putting Bill Murray in a bit more it was definitely one of the best Farrely Brothers movies. Overall the movie is a must watch for any fan of such movies as There's something about Mary, Dumb and Dumber and other movies along that line or if you just wanna watch a movie that will make you laugh. I rate this movie 73%.",Kingpin
76,peeedeee-94281,Entertaining But Falls Apart Towards The End,5,9 October 2019,"I finally got around to watching this Farrelly brothers movie. I've seen Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary, etc... I thought I had scene Kingpin, but as I watched it, it didn't seem familiar.
The story wasn't quite original. A star athelete who gets down on his luck and finds a protege to coach to greatness - its been done many times before. This one was set in the world of bowling.
For this movie, unfortunately, you have to set a lot of the logic aside to really find it funny. Like an Amish guy who is an expert bowler and is able to hide it from his family (strangely, they kept calling him a 'boy', Randy Quaid looked older than Woody Harrelson). Somehow they are able to travel across the country with almost no money, with the intention of arriving in Reno Nevada to enter a bowling tournament?
But where the movie really falls apart is the whole thing was a set up for Randy Quaid's Ishmael character to shine in Reno. But then he hurts his hand, and Woody Harrelson's Roy decides to bowl instead. Huh? So you think, hmm, how is he going to bowl with his left hand? Is he going to have time to practise?
No, the movie instead has him using his prosthetic hand to bowl. Now, throughout the movie, we've been shown how the hand is more like a glorified rubber glove. It's very flimsy, and can come off easily. The fingers have no support, so they're easily bent back. Yet, Roy suddenly is able to carry a 12lb bowling ball in that hand?!! That's where the movie really loses me.
Then you have Ishmael leaving without saying goodbye, so you think that Roy is mad at him, because Ishmael didn't even stay to see him win or lose. And even though Roy manages to earn some money (who pays a $500,000 advance for advertising?), he gives it all just to save Ishmael's Amish community. Seems a bit too generous, even if he did get the love of bowling back, kind of.
So while this comedy has some enjoyable moments, the way Roy is able to bowl competitively after not having bowled in 17 years, and with a soft rubber glove, doesn't really hold up. But I will say I did find the fly away comb-overs that Bill Murray and Woody Harrelson had in that final match was pretty funny.
Yes, I get it's a comedy, but come on, this isn't set in a fantasy world on a fantasy planet. Farrelly brothers should have come up with a better final 20 minutes.",Kingpin
77,ryan_kuhn,The Amish and Bowling. Brilliant!,7,13 February 2005,"Only the Farrelly brothers could envision a story featuring a down-and-out has been bowler, played to perfection by Woody Harrelson, and the Amish, specifically the naive bowling prodigy played by Randy Quaid. I'm not really sure what brought these two world together in the Farrelly's mind, but whatever it was, I'm glad they thought of it. A very funny movie exploring what people will do when they have nothing to lose, not even their shame. Harrelson plays the once famous bowler Roy Munson who fell off the map in the 70s when his bowling had was removed from his body, coining the phrase ""Munson-ed,"" meaning to be at the top and throw it all away. To help pay the bills, he meets Isheael (Quaid) who has great natural talent at bowling and is convinced by Munson to go to Reno to play in the national championship. Between the Amish settlement and Reno, the two go through various adventures that often pay tribute to Ishmael's Amish naiveté, such as the confusion over who actually has to pay for a lap-dance, and famous scenes from other movies, most notably ones from The Hustler. Kingpin also features Bill Murray in one of his fantastic roles, this time as the swarmmy bowling champion Ernie McCracken. We get the sense that all of the characters in the movie are desperate, either for money for his people, Ishmael goes along on the trip to win money for his Amish settlement, or to reclaim fame and fortune, Munson, or to just be known as the best, McCracken, and it's the desperation that leads to the comedy and the human touch. The film also features Vanessa Angel as a bimbo who helps Munson and Ishmael out of tough spot, and ""Jefferson's on Ice!"" perhaps one of the funniest TV parodies in a movie. Just look at Weezie go!",Kingpin

In fact, the only movies that can be compared to 'Kingpin', are the other two Farrelli masterpieces, 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'There's something about Mary'. The fact that American Pie was more successful than Kingpin, doesn't make it a better movie. Also, it is utterly insulting (to art) when anyone uses the Farrelli movies humor as a reference to 'Scary Movie'. 'Kingpin' is the second part of the Farrelli's comedic trilogy that changed the world of comedy and inspired EVERY other comedy that came in the new millennium. The story is about an ex-bowling player on a road trip, to find his lost dignity. Woody Harrelson is brilliant as the leading actor and Randy Quaid is great too. Bill Murray is one of best  comedians of our times and delivers as usual, but the supporting cast is great as well. You see, 'Kingpin' is really dependent on performances, because despite of what some might believe, all Farrelli movies are emotionally intense. It is this emotional intensity that makes the extreme scenes so funny; the audience cares about the characters and whatever happens to them.It is the craftsmanship of the Farrelli brothers that made the transition from the humor prior to 'Dumb and Dumber' to today's movie humor so flawless. Unfortunately, it also give license to the opportunists, to offend their audience by including gross out scenes in their movies, without having the aesthetic taste to achieve it properly.Still, the acceptance of movies like 'Scary Movie' ('Kingpin' scores barely one point over 'Scary movie' on imdb), created a field of competition that destroyed even the latest Farrelli creations. We will have to wait until someone comes up with something as brilliant as the Farrelli movies of the 90's, in order to get rid of this situation.10/10",Kingpin

Amish prodigy Ishmael (Randy Quaid) stands to be Munson's shot at winning the largest tournament in the country, but the road there is paved with consequence.This is one of the funniest movies ever made. The Farrelly brothers have given us countless laughs, but this is their best. It brings together some of the most unexpected actors, many out of their element in a comedy, to flawlessly turn a script into a comedic work of art. The laughs are typical Farrelly gross out while remaining truly, deeply funny.Woody Harrelson turns in one of his best performances as the down-but-not-out Munson, wearing a ridiculous wig, outdated clothing, and always his fake rubber hand. Each scene he's in is a lesson in how to lead a comedy, and reminds one of his early days on ""Cheers"" as the bartender Woody Boyd. His co-star in Quaid is the same; whether it be the murderous, greedy Sheriff is ""Hard Rain"", or here as the hilariously simple sure relative of the ""Vacation"" movies Cousin Eddie, Randy Quaid proves his ever surprising versatility as an actor.Bill Murray also fires on all cylinders as the over the top McCracken, Harrelson's arch-nemesis. Murray's last scene is one of the best in the movie; with his hair tossed every which way and his eyes flooding with tears he makes you shocked that he's only been nominated for one Oscar. Vanessa Angel is mostly eye candy but she doesn't have to make up for any acting downfalls.""Kingpin"" is well-casted, well-written, consistently engaging and always funny.

84,ray-280,Now I Know Why I Quit Bowling,10,16 August 2005,"I say this in a good way: this film captures bowling's underbelly, where even the pro stars sometimes have to supplement their income the old-fashioned way: by taking it directly from obviously weaker bowlers who somehow manage to be convinced to risk their money. Just as poker games are often won with guns, bowling for money has hazards all its own, something I learned even as a junior bowler hustling games after the league on Saturday.Roy E. Munson (Woody Harrelson) is such a loser that acting like a total loser is actually called ""being Munsoned."" The term is named after an incident where some victims of a bowling hustle relieve Roy of his right hand in a gruesome manner which involves bowling equipment. Somehow, even THAT manages to be funny, which speaks to the quality of this film, a film smart enough to have its three main stars on screen for most of the time. The 1979 accident was the result of Roy taking the fall for the hustle engineered by legendary bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray).Fast forward to 1996, and Roy stumbles across an Amish bowler named Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), the most talented bowler he's ever come across. He offers to coach Ishmael for a $1 million tournament in Reno, Nevada that can save his family farm, but Ishmael is conflicted (the deepest emotion of the film) because he has strayed from the Amish country. Ishmael's brother is the requisite family member sent to bring the stray relative back home, and Vanessa Angel is extra-hot as the love interest for almost every guy in the film.If you think this is a parody of bowling, the joke may be on you. Hang around enough lanes, in certain places, and you just might see these guys or something very close to them. Just be careful if they look drunk and want to play for money.",Kingpin

They improve upon that film in this, their 2nd effort.Plot In A Nutshell: A washed-up once-promising bowler (Woody Harrelson) sees his chance to return to the limelight as the manager of a raw but talented newcomer (Randy Quaid).Why I rated it a '9': Because I laughed a lot. I mean, A LOT. I'm talking finding a scene so funny, you rewind it to watch it again. And laugh again. Then rewind it and watch a 3rd time. And STILL laugh again. There are several moments like this scattered throughout ""Kingpin,"" making it an absolute pleasure from start to finish. Woody Harrelson is fantastic as the jinxed Roy Munson, and Bill Murray does not disappoint as his bowling nemesis.The plot is nothing original but it's not really about the plot. Meaning, the plot is not what makes ""Kingpin"" so good. It's just the structure for the many jokes and gags in the film. And there are so many of those, and so funny, this is one I will return to again and again.Favorite scene: Roy's getting sick at the toilet bowl after having 'serviced' his revolting landlord as payment for the rent he doesn't have.

It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous.

91,MadReviewer,And You Call Yourselves A Bowling Alley?,7,20 April 2001,"Just on principle, any movie about Amish bowlers should be funny. ""Kingpin"", which is a Farrelly Brothers film about an Amish bowler, is not only howlingly funny, it's also sick, twisted, and one of the most underrated comedies of recent years.  While not quite up to the lowbrow genius of the Farrelly Brothers' other films (""Dumb and Dumber"", ""There's Something About Mary""), there's enough crude humor blended with a genuinely engaging story to create a film that's remarkably good.Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is a promising young bowling champion who has the audacity to defeat the king of the local lanes, Ernie McCracken  (Bill Murray, in a delightfully sleazy, love-to-hate role). Ernie decides that Roy needs to learn a lesson in manners, one thing leads to another Three Stooges style, and Roy's bowling career is suddenly ended by a freakish injury, one which costs him his bowling hand.  (The sheer fact that the manner in which this is done is hysterically funny is a tribute to the Farrelly Brothers' gift for comedy.)  Fast forward ten years to a fat, bitter, and balding Roy, who suddenly spots Ishmael Boorg , a kid with a real gift for bowling . . . a sweet, innocent, Amish kid.  Roy takes the kid under his wing, and in a crude, darkly funny series of events that oddly seems to parody ""The Color of Money"", Roy begins to teach the kid about bowling . . . and about life.""Kingpin"" isn't exactly the most intelligent comedy ever made -- one of the best jokes in the film involves X's efforts to milk a bull -- but it is darn funny.  Like other Farrelly Brothers films. there's also a certain level of sweetness mixed in with all the bawdy humor, which gives the film some depth and makes it more than just a 90 minute R-rated Three Stooges routine.  As stupid as some of these characters are -- and there's plenty of stupid to pass around in ""Kingpin"" -- you actually care about what happens to them. They aren't just walking punchlines.Of special mention is Bill Murray, who brings new dimensions to the word slime.  With his sequined shirts, plastered comb-over, and condescending sneer, Murray looks and acts like a cross between a used car salesman and Hitler.  As Ernie McCracken , Murray relishes being loathed and hated, and man, he gives you plenty of hilarious reasons to hate him.Highly recommended, if you appreciate fun, dumb, politically incorrect jokes.

I think that pulling tears from the public is hard, but pulling laughs from the audience is as hard or harder than that!, this movie did it masterfully. I really was amazed of how Bill Murray as Ernie McCracken could perform such a hateful character, he does, and the impression that i felt was totally of hate for McCracke, great for Murray's performance!; the music is simply spectacular, the song played by Blues Traveler is great!, this movie also have a soundtrack worth to buy; some Urge Overkill song is heard in the movie too. But the thing that finally i liked most was that this movie, being a comedy, give a good lesson for life, for honesty and care for the others; you have to see the movie to the end to understand this!. Some scenes that i loved where the bully milking, the strip dancing of Ishmael, the hand on breast, etc, I laughed in this movie, and when i think about it some smiles come again.ABOUT THE MOVIE: Woody Harrelson is Roy Munson a great bowler trained by his dad since he was a child and who was the Nevada state champion of 1979 beating the hateful Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray), after this in some incidents with bets with some bad guys Munson lose his right hand, and his career was spoiled, he isolates and start to drink, wasting his life. 17 years after that, he mets an Amish man, Ishmael Borg (Randy Quaid) who show a special talent for bowling, he tries to convince him to compete, but for his traditions he prefer to stay at home. Munson see in Ishmael a chance to go back to success and try by all means to convince him to compete.

93,fatcat-73450,Generic Early 90's Gross-Out Farce With some Amish Flavouring,5,28 October 2021,"Not much to say. Generic sports film plot about bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been bowling pro whose career was curt short by the super sleazy and egotistic character of Bill Murray. Randy Quaid plays a big dumb innocent Amish guy pretty well. There's also a female character that's just the love interest and doesn't do much else other than that.In true 90's fashion they coyly push against the barriers for gross-out films without going very far. Instead of actually showing anything gross, a woman will make a lewd gesture or a character will walk along with a bucket of white liquid and be informed that he just ""milked a bull."" It's the type of silly farce Will Ferrell is famous for doing to death about a decade later except probably showing less on screen than they would in 2000s movies.The way bowling is elevated in the fictional world of this movie to an extremely important sport is pretty funny. For example, the main bowling tournament in the film has a prize of one million dollars (I haven't checked the figures, but I really doubt any bowling competition has such a big prize) and the father of the main character uses bowling to teach his son about life.The Quaid character is Amish... for some strange and unnecessary reason... And this does make the movie more memorable, but other than making it easier to pinpoint in a lineup, I would say it has a completely neutral impact on te movie overall.It's worth noting that the dramatic moments are surprisingly well-done. Harrelson's character's interactions with the love interest and with his father are surprisingly effective and serious.Other than that, it's barely worth watching. You'll probably get more out of a later comedy in this genre - there are plenty.The poster seems to imply it's a sex comedy. It's not, it's a sports movie. I don't know why they did that.Honourable Mentions: I, Tonya (2017). A masterful biopic about another minor sport, this time (figure?) skating.

It works as a good movie about bowling with a little bit of a mean spirited edge, and a lot of personalities mostly, it is just decent in its execution.

I remember this movie coming out in the mid nineties and thought it was funnier at the time. Some of the jokes have lost a little connotation for the time. Bill Murray is always awesome and played the bad guy this time around. Both Harrelson's and Murray's characters are old 70's professional bowlers competing in present day 90's in a tournament for a lot of money. I didn't find the Amish jokes offensive they were in good fun on a culture of people who exist among us in small country communities preserving the way of life they feel is the way to live. Kingpin is creepy, gross, funny.",Kingpin
97,meshborg68,Bowled Over,10,20 January 2021,I really really love this film.Its a comedy classic.Bill and Woody's characters are brilliant.Never gets old.Could watch it every week.The jokes one liners and visual gags are everywhere.,Kingpin
98,davesjbb,Funniest movie I had ever seen at that time,9,31 May 2021,"In 1996, this was outrageously funny, put me in tears. Rapid fire funny lines. Bill Murray had so many funny moments, I'd miss some and catch them on the second or third viewing. Great cast and plot with many twists and turns.Today it's hard to enjoy a 1996 movie as much, but it still holds up pretty well. I haven't seen a good comedy in 15-20 years.",Kingpin
99,dyingrepublicofpanama,Get on the gravy train with biscuit wheels,10,22 September 2018,"Truly the greatest US film comedy's ever made. Comedy is born out of tragedy and Roy Munson story certainly was one of that. Bill Murray gives his best performance since Ghostbuster 1984Woody Harrelson , an amazin comic actor delivers his best. Great story. Hilarious one liners...And remember. ..A bowlers worst enemy is his eyes and his ears !",Kingpin
100,Vassago,"I felt guilty laughing, but it *is* funny!",10,31 December 2000,"Yes, this movie is rude, crude and cruel. But it's also funny and you can't help it! :) It's just great - well, perhaps with the exception of Murray. I can't stand this wooden guy and his annoying ""acting"". But even he didn't spoil the movie too much... :)",Kingpin
101,mulhollandman,An abrasive comedy that is not for all tastes,10,26 August 2006,"Kingpin should be approached with the same kind apprehension that any sane person would approach any Farrelly Brothers film. Expect a procession of jokes at the expensive of the main characters, fused with an simple storyline and that's exactly what to expect from a Farrelly brothers film.Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a washed bowler that had potential to be a professional Bowler but his dream comes to an end when he encounters Ernie McCracken, played to perfection by Bill Murray who ends up costing Roy Munson his bowling hand. Cut to mid-90's Roy is now an alcoholic, in serious debt. A chance meeting with Ishamel Boorg, played by Randy Quaid, an naive Amish man at a bowling alley leads to the pairs cross country trip to save both their respective futures. Along the way they met Claudia, played by Vanessa Angel, a tough talking con woman with her own mission. Together the three form an unbreakable bond and come face to face with their adversary Ernie McCracken.I like my comedy to be intelligent, and Kingpin is one of the few movies of its kind that actually makes me laugh. It made me laugh when I first saw it in 1996 it made me laugh till I was sore and now ten years on in 2006 it still makes me laugh. The cast are brilliant and it's their talents that really keep this comedy from dating. Randy Quaid is always solid, Vanessa Angel is devilish sexy and cunning, Woody Harrelson is suitably vexed and Bill Murray reminds us all why he has remained Hollywood's main comedy actor long since all his peers disappeared.Kingpin is definitely for an adult audience and it is worth watching some night that there is nothing on the television or at the cinema. Not for all tastes but damn it is good and it is one of the Farrelly brothers better films in my opinion. 10 out of 10",Kingpin
102,dainamariebradley,Stupid funny! Right up my alley!,10,24 August 2021,"I didn't expect all that much from this film but I was...bowled over! I grew up watching my dad bowl with his buddies in a league and bowling myself (I was never even passable!) but saw my dad win a local championship ring for the highest score. I also grew up watching SNL from the very first episode, so it was already a win/win I guess I forgot how really funny these kinds of movies could be. I just watched this for the first time and it was so entertaining! I loved the music, the bowling alleys, the 60s and 70s atmosphere, the old cars, seeing people socialize like we used to...it was all a blast! Bill Murray played a good, hilarious villain, I wanted to smack him so bad! No spoilers, just break out the snacks and watch this, and get ready to laugh your a** off!",Kingpin
103,helenaduberry,The Farrelly brothers' worst film,6,22 November 2000,"To start off with, Kingpin is OK. It's not hysterically funny, yet it raises a smile from time to time. Yes, it is the Farrelly's worst film to date (including Me, Myself & Irene), but as said before, it's still alright. Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was a sleazy but well-known bowling champion. However one night, his 'friend' Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray, as ever he is brilliant) sets him up and Roy is attacked, eventually having his hand sliced off. 17 years later he is living a peaceful life. Until he meets Ishmael (Randy Quaid, who is quite annoying in this film). A 'Dumb & Dumber' style road trip ensues, where Ishmael earns some money with his bowling skills. They meet Claudia (Vanessa Angel, who is wooden in this one) on the way as well. Overall it's alright, with some good bits (""I'm all nippy.""), but overall slightly disappointing.",Kingpin
104,itakethesquare,Bill Murray,10,18 September 2021,"I swear he's more evil in this one than in ""Scrooged"". The Farrelly brothers have a great nose for making prime-time comedy. It seems like they have a lot of fun on set with the actors and let them roam free and come up with some improvised bits.Randy Quaid is an underdog, he plays the opposite of his character in the National Lampoon Vacation saga as a good-hearted Amish man who may be a prodigy at bowling. His fish-out-of-sea dialogue hits the funny bone no matter what.Woody Harrelson's character goes from being also Light-hearted and a prodigy at bowling to going a complete 180 as a washed-up has been who's down on his luck.You will see a lot of familiar faces of the Farrelly Bros cinema and they all make a very silly story into a fun flick for friends and your partner. They also make gross-out humor very heartwarming in their endings.Bill Murray though. He steals the movie whenever he's on the camera (as always) with his sarcasm, wit, and rudeness. He definitely needs a Groundhog Day visit after this one. Man, how did this pass PG-13?",Kingpin
105,varsania,Big Bill rulez!!,10,23 May 2001,"Superb film. A real piece of art. We all know who makes this film so there is no need to beat about the bush.

106,aefrench,"If you like bowling, you'll like this.",8,14 April 2010,"For all of you who are looking for a good comedy, I recommend ""Kingpin."" This is a movie that consistently makes me laugh.The main character is Roy Munson (played by Woody Harrelson), a man whose promising career as a bowler was cut short after a hustle attempt led to the loss of his bowling hand. Nearly twenty years later, he is an alcoholic who sells bowling supplies to local alleys. One day, he meets an Amish man named Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who impresses Roy with his bowling skills. Later on, Roy reads about an upcoming bowling tournament that is to be held at the National Bowling Stadium in Reno, Nevada, with the grand prize being one million dollars. Believing Ishmael could have a legitimate chance in the contest, Roy heads to the Amish community where Ishmael resides, finding him and telling him about the opportunity. At first, Ishmael passes on the idea because he does not want his family to find out he bowls. However, once he learns that the community is in financial trouble, he agrees to go to Reno with Roy.Roy becomes Ishmael's trainer, teaching him what is necessary to claim victory in the tournament. Along the way, they meet up with a woman named Claudia (Vanessa Angel) at the home of her boyfriend Stanley, with whom Ishmael has a bowling match with in an effort to win some money to get to Reno. Things go awry at Stanley's, and Claudia leaves there with the duo and they make their way across the U.S. to Reno, where Roy discovers that Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray), is bowling in the event. McCracken was involved in the situation that ultimately cost Roy his career, and this is the first time they have met face to face since that night. Ishmael has an accident and breaks his wrist, which of course eliminates any chance of him competing in the contest. This leads Roy back to the lanes, bowling for the first time in years. How will he do?""Kingpin"" makes one laugh in different ways. To start with, there are plenty of laughs generated by Roy's hook and prosthetic hand. The film itself is a spoof of ""The Natural"" (if you've watched that, you'll see what I mean). Randy Quaid is good as Ishmael, and Ishmael's lack of knowledge about life outside his home leads to some pretty funny moments. Bill Murray is talented at playing obnoxious characters, and he is perfect as Ernie McCracken. Vanessa Angel of ""Weird Science"" fame is also well cast as Claudia. There are funny lines throughout the movie and there are some gross out moments (you have been warned). Overall, this is just pure comedy that is enjoyable.",Kingpin
107,ChoiceCuts,The second best bowling-movie.,8,24 February 2004,"The second best film I've seen about bowling, ""The Big Lebowski"" is by far the best. This one is about the ex-star bowler (Harrelson) who wants to reclaim his former glory by helping a promising talent (Quaid). Bill Murray (very funny!) plays his biggest rival. Most of the jokes here are about sex, but somehow the Farrelys make it work without making it cruel like a whole bunch of other films, they actually seem to like the characters the movie is about. Kingpin is maybe not as good as ""There's something about Mary"" but it's still a great movie and it's well worth your attention.8/10",Kingpin
108,johnson50,Eddie McCraken rules OK!,9,6 December 2003,"What a totally mad fim! Woody Harrelson is just brilliant as the one handed Munson, Randy Quaid is excellent as the naive Ishmael, even if he does seem a little old for the role, and Vanessa Angel........enough said! But it's Bill Murray who steals the film as the lascivious, crooked and thoroughly revolting Eddie McCracken. What a tour de force.If you're looking for a sophisticated, light hearted comedy, then this isn't it. To say the comedy is crude, is an understatement but it is typical Farrelly brothers and hilariously funny, non PC and very crude. It's one of those films which, when you explain the storyline to someone who hasn't seen it, sounds totally ridiculous, confusing and pointless and leaves them with a bemused look on their face - a sure sign of greatness!",Kingpin
109,rejoefrankel,Pitifully unfunny gross-out film.,1,16 February 2000,"Kingpin wants to be the film that people talk about and grimace with a smile.  It wants to be the ultimate in politically incorrect, tasteless, gross-out comedy, but it fails miserably.  There is virtually nothing in this film that warrants two hours of the discriminating viewer's time OR the usually gifted cast.  A waste of celluloid.  As forgettable as it is unfunny.",Kingpin
110,michellemurmurs6244,You call this funny?,2,19 August 2005,A promising bowler leaves home to become a champion the town folk can be proud of. Idealistic and naive he falls prey to a rival bowler's plot to remove his competition and ends up losing a hand. Interesting plot so far. What is done with it is supposed to be a rip roaring slap-your-knee laugh fest. Well I've laughed more at online postings than I did well watching this. Maybe I just don't get the Farrelly brothers type of humor if that's what you call it. There's a bunch of sight gags that go nowhere and look really lame. There are jokes that you see coming a mile off and just repeat themselves. There are some usual disgusting scenes that make you cringe. What this movie doesn't seem to have is any originality. OK so there's an Amish bowler but he comes off as stupid just so we can laugh at the predictable stupid things he does. Like the other characters he's two-dimensional and not that likable. It's a shame that a otherwise talented cast is stuck with this turkey on their resumes.,Kingpin
111,jrwollscheid,Hilarious sports film with amazingly ridiculous performances,8,31 August 2020,"A movie very similar to Major League or Dodgeball, this movie is the definition of your immature sports comedy. The film is great for late night viewings and brought more laughs from me than a lot of comedies I've watched recently. Why watch Oscar-worthy Woody Harrelson, when you can watch this gem? That's not even being sarcastic. Woody Harrelson shines as his usual sleaze-bag who changes his way by the end of the movie. He plays a bowling master who has his arm cut off after a bet gone wrong. Woody helps train an Amish bowler and takes him to a Reno bowling tournament to win a million dollars to save his farm. They meet all sorts of crazy characters on the way to Reno including Woody's old rival Ernie McCracken. The film does not have much in terms of great shots nor should it. The film is a good late night comedy that I highly recommend watching on Netflix.",Kingpin

114,alangalpert,Howlingly funny!,8,10 May 2010,"""Kingpin"" is either the grossest funny movie or the funniest gross movie I have ever seen. Few comedies, even good ones, can make me laugh so hard that I cry, but this one did. Half the time I was laughing; the other half, I was shaking my head at the raunchiness of it all. If you can watch this movie without laughing uncontrollably, you should consider replacement surgery for your funny bone.As others have said, the cast is perfect. Vanessa Angel is so hot I was afraid my VHS tape would melt. Randy Quaid (looking a lot like a much larger version of the Little Dutch Boy) is dopey and lovable. Woody Harrelson is smooth and cocksure when he should be, and pitiable when the situation requires it. And the always amazing Bill Murray might be the most detestable (but hilarious) egomaniac on celluloid - it is no small feat to be both detestable and hilarious.I have no idea how ""Kingpin"" qualified for a PG-13 rating. Even an R is a stretch, although there is no nudity or graphic violence.The movie has a kick-ass soundtrack, but perhaps a few too many songs. Music should enhance a film, not overwhelm it, as it sometimes does in this case.In the midst of all the vulgarity and chicanery, there is even a moral. After spending seventeen years drunk and in denial, Roy (Harrelson) comes to realize that, in the end, we have no one to blame for our problems but ourselves.",Kingpin

I've played it to so many people over the years and it's never failed to draw belly laughs and tears.One of Woody's best roles.......how one succeeds to be that funny and touching at the drop of a hat I can only marvel at. It is something rarely seen and I'm glad I've witnessed it at least once. It's in my collection and I know that over the years it'll keep being pulled out on a regular basis....film!Briefly: A bowler doesn't fulfil his youthful promise and disappears into obscurity and the bottle only to be inspired years later by a young Amish man with a strong right arm and the prospect of coaching him to the final of a million dollar tournament. A road movie ensues with Vanessa Angel providing much more than a female interest.There's no nudity to speak of but a lot of sexual and bodily function based humour....Hey! It's a Farrelly brothers movie! That isn't the only source of the film's humour and........ Bill Murray is the icing on the cake...the epitome of the cynical, hedonistic, self centred, insensitive comedy villain. If you haven't seen it.......you gotta!!!",Kingpin

There are a lot of people out there that will say this is a slapstick movie, full of fart jokes and low-brow humor.  Those kind of comments frustrate me, because it's my contention that Kingpin is the best of the Farrelly brothers' movies.  In fact, Kingpin is one of my favorite movies of the 90's.  Not only is the humor in the movie a lot more complex than some people realize, the story is original, honest, and entertaining.

I - and I'm not kidding you here - almost got laughed out of a conversation for admitting to having paid to see it in a theatre. And no, I don't live in Snobland, but thanks for asking.Why is this movie so bad? It's not funny. Simple as that. Is a guy getting his arm torn off in a bowling-ball-shiner machine funny? No. Mind you, getting an ear bitten off isn't particularly funny either but both Mike Tyson and the Big Lebowski made it work.  This movie doesn't make anything work at all, I've rarely seen so many minutes without a laugh - hell, even dramas usually have more funny scenes. Now that I've mentioned Big Lebowski - there's an excellent, excellent, hilarious... err... excellent movie - and it involves bowling too. But this? This aggression on movie-making will not stand.

122,mapeoleaf,Long Live the Comb Over,7,30 December 2003,"I thought this movie was great.  It has a fantastic cast made up of Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Bill Murray.  I agree with other users that this film has not been rated fairly.  You simply have to take it for what it's worth, and I personally think it's wonderful!Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson, a drunken, former pro-bowler trying with much difficulty to earn a buck.  He discovers a young Amish man who may be his ticket back to bowling prestige (if that actually exists).  The two bowling hopefuls proceed on a road trip to win the grand prize in a bowling championship in Las Vegas.   This movie is truly hilarious!  Woody Harrelson does a fantastic job in the role of the sad sack ex-bowler with a rubber hand.  He seems to have aged ten years in his portrayal of this character.  Bill Murray is his adversary, ""Big Ern"" McCracken, whose bad toupee seems to have a life of its own. Murray is wonderful in this role with his cocky and pompous attitude.  There are certain scenes of his character in a television commercial that are quite literally, marvelous.  Finally to finish off this stellar cast we have Randy Quaid as Ishmael, the Naïve Amish man who could quite possibly be the next Bowling legend. I must also mention the gorgeous Vanessa Angel as Claudia.  Her character is under developed but she still has the charisma and sex appeal to ignite her scenes.This movie must be viewed for what it is worth.  This means, it is not Oscar material but it is a very funny movie.  So watch the film with this in mind and enjoy all the hilarious scenes and great performances. 7/10",Kingpin

While DUMB AND DUMBER is probably their best, (and possibly the funniest film of the 1990s), KINGPIN might be the Farrelly's silver medalist.  The pitch alone is worth a laugh: a one-handed bowler (crippled by thugs after a fixed bowling game!) takes on an Amish protege and heads to Reno for the national tournament.  And the cast elevates this ridiculous premise to comedy-heaven. Woody Harrelson gives a hilarious performance in the lead, and his character is surprisingly well-rounded.

No matter how many times i see it, i can't help but laugh and randy quaid's naive amish person, and my personal favorite Bill (Big Ern) McCracken.

Brilliantly cast Woody Harrelson guides the delightful Vanessa Angel and dutiful Randy Quaid across the U.S, dodging sex starved fogies and robbing sheep-loving yokels to reach the mecca that is Reno.  Having sampled Ms Angel's pins, we get caught up in the 10 pin duel between Harrelson and the undoubtable star of the movie..Bill Murray. The genius of Murray is on show for all to see, and he simply cannot be beaten for sheer comic timing.

130,dirkwildenborg,"Entertaining, at moments very funny movie with some serious flaws",6,22 September 2006,"Kingpin isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty entertaining for a, if i can put it like that, standard comedy built around a certain theme (bowling). I'm not getting into the story, since so many others have done that before me already. Let's get to the characters. I'll immediately say that I liked Bill Murray the most. He was awesome, close to being g@y but gallantly maintaining manliness through the entire movie. With his character, the movie kind of insults the viewer though. For instance, how can we expect the audience to actually like him? Don't get me wrong, he's a great character, but he's supposed to be the bad guy and he doesn't have what it takes to come over as the lovable kind. That's all good, but during the bowling matches it's just not right that the audience seems to like him. His arrogance and cockiness are spread throughout and should be a reason for the crowd to despise him, not like him. I understand that for the sake of the underdog argument, he's supposed to be liked by the masses, but it would have made the movie so much better in my eyes had he been just been despised by the crowd. Harrelson is under-doggy enough already, we don't need to have that emphasized any more. That said, Bill Murray's still a great watch.Randy Quaid, as the ""naive"" Amish, is great but slips up miserably at some points. The idea of having a naive Amish is lovely, it's just that at some moments, he's portrayed as plain stupid - in sharp contrast to just ""naive"". For instance, there's a point where Harrelson says something like ""Holy sh!t"" and Quaid goes something like ""Where do you see sh!t?"" I don't recall the exact situation anymore, but such things happen in this movie while they shouldn't. The love triangle was kind of excessive to me. Please explain to me this: evil lover is abandoned by chick -> lover meets chick again and although it is flat out OBVIOUS that the chick didn't like him, the evil guy still falls for her again after a few cheesy lines of 'let's get back together and make things good for the both of us, I never really wanted to leave you'. The 'evil lover' was underwhelming also, the 'good guys' were afraid of him but they never really had a reason to. It would have been so much, so much cooler had the evil lover type had a bunch of mean looking gangster types with guns around him. Over the top, of course, but so much more awesome. There is a problem with the lady also. The first few times we get to meet her, she seems like a hard-a$$ chick who can handle herself. Then at some point, when she says something to insult the evil lover guy, the tone of the scene shifts incomprehensibly to a situation where she gets abused by her evil friend. It just made no sense to me. She shows no depth in her acting either. In the scene where she and Harrelson visit Harrelson's hometown, Harrelson holds up very well but she just lacks what it takes to make the scene really work. To be honest, the lady just slowed the movie down, while not putting anything meaningful to the table. Harrelson was great, I liked his character and he put down his role pretty well. Some jokes with his fake hand were well done, sometimes fooling the viewer in a good way but also failing the gimmick once (I only saw it go wrong once, might have been more often).All in all, this movie is pretty fun but with a few adjustments, it could have been so much better.",Kingpin

It's by the Farrelly Brothers who also made the moderately funny Dumb and Dumber and the hilarious There's Something About Mary.  Of those three, Kinpin is definitely the best.  The laughs keep on coming, even when watching at home on video.  Naturally there are a few gags that didn't work for me, but they can easily be overlooked.  All the gags that work, work very well and receive long, loud laughs.  Another surprise, Chris Elliot is actually funny. He's only in it for one joke, about five minutes, but it works very well.

When people speak about Farrelly movies, they rarely mention this movie, and that's a shame.  I'm a fan of all of their movies, but this one is my favorite.The reason it is my favorite is because it has one of the funniest performances I have ever seen.  Bill Murray as ""Big"" Ern McCracken is amazing.  He is such a b*****d yet, he's so funny.  Check out the diner scene between he and Woody Harrelson's Roy Munson(another great performance).  There are four things that Bill Murray does in this scene that are perhaps the funniest things I have ever seen.  I couldn't stop laughing when he tells the waitress(who has just delivered their drinks)""You wanna wash that perfume off before you come back to our table.""  The look on Bill's face, and the delivery of that line are truly inspiring.I would rank this performance right up there with Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight's performances in Caddyshack.  This is why Bill Murray is one of the greatest comedic actors ever.",Kingpin

It is a hilarious movie and one of the best comedies I ever seen. It has the same sense of humor of films like the Naked Gun, and the cast is great.Kingpin is a cleaver movie with a different plot(where did they came up with the idea of making a movie about a former bowling player that nowadays has a rubber hand, teaching an Amish guy to play bowling so they can win a competition that pays 1 million).Definitively one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.

Another is when a lady reporter is interviewing him on camera and she asks if he wants to respond to a paternity suit a woman filed on him. He says,"" yes i want to make it very clear. I pulled out of her really early"". LOLOLOLOL.And after he wins the championship match and tells the reporter he was worried because he didn't want to get beat by a guy with a hook.

It's filled with bathroom humor and jokes with completely flat punchlines.  My kids hated it, and they like low brow humor a la Adam Sadler and Paul Shore (although they're growing out of that).  The premise of this movie is absurd.  The acting is pretty bad.  Woody Harrelson walks through it with zero expression.  Bill Murray has a small role and it's not his best.

146,hpschlos,"""KINGPIN""-- A",9,21 May 2000,"What makes a great comedy?  Funny scenes.  Funny characters.  Funny dialogue.  ""Kingpin"" has all of these qualities and in large doses.  It's one of the top ten comedies of the past ten years, and in my opinion, the crowning achievement of the Farelly brothers thus far.""Dumb and Dumber"" was hilarious.  ""There's Something About Mary"" took the romantic comedy to a new level.  But ""Kingpin"" stands out as the most bizarre and likeable film of the Farelly trilogy.  Much like the ""Billy Madison"" of Adam Sandler films, ""Kingpin"" is not so much funnier than the rest of the Farelly Brother's movies, as it is more weird and awesome.There are some scenes that drag, and I don't think Randy Quaid's character is as funny as it should have been, but everything else here is gold. Woody gives a great comedic performance.  Vanessa Angel has a great chest (""and those babies are real!"")  Uncle Willie, Chris Elliot, and the landlady are superb.I could write an epic poem on the greatness of Bill Murray in this movie, but I won't.  Suffice it to say that his performance in ""Kingpin"" is best thing he has ever done.  Its the best part of the movie.  He's not in it nearly enough, but that only makes you cherish his scenes all the more.However, the most underrated character in this movie, and in cinematic history for that matter, is unquestionably the ""Great Stan"" (Vanessa Angel's boyfriend).  He represents everything that is enigmatic of the human condition.  He's simultaneously slick and weird.  He wears black turtlenecks and has a gray streak in his hair.  He beats women, and makes fun of the beating of women, while respecting the beauty of the natural woman.  He is violent and depraved, yet he frowns upon cheating.  He drinks Coca-cola. He has some weird friends.  And last, but not least, he has a bowling alley in his basement.  Modern psychology has yet to fully comprehend such a character.  Perhaps it never will.  But one thing is certain:  the ""Great Stan"" is the best thing to ever come out of either art or reality.Kingpin is a great movie.",Kingpin

It took no skill to make this film and it is a disgrace to filmmakers everywhere. THIS FILM CONTAINS THE TYPE OF MISTAKES THAT DIRECTORS AND WRITERS SHOULD NEVER MAKE AND BE AWARE OF!

149,fordlaw,There is more to the surface than meets the eye.,6,25 January 2000,"Warning small spoiler....This movie is about what you should expect from the Farrelly brothers. Crude and juvenile humor based on bodily functions yet at the same time a subtext of sophisticated cultural references and fleeting brushes with true drama. Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray are excellent as two feuding professional bowlers. Roy Munson(Harrelson) is a small town hero who's ticket to fame ends when he loses his bowling hand due to the Ernie McCracken(Murray). Bitter and resentful Munson lives a sad and pathetic life in exile. Harrelson plays the role of Munson to painful perfection with his pitiful comb over and reliance on booze to get him through the day. ""I only get sick when I don't drink."", Munson says to Ishmael(Randy Quaid), the Amish bowling phenomenon in whom he places his hopes of redemption. Along the way to Reno and the bowling championship Roy and Ishmael pick up Claudia(Vanessa Angel). In spite of her obvious beauty Claudia isn't any better off than the wretched Roy. These three losers reluctantly rely on each other to attain their own idea of redemption. Ultimately this is a story about the characters struggle with failure and their ability to forgive themselves and move on. The most poignant scene of the move comes when Roy returns to his home town in Iowa. When he returns he finds the town's fortunes haven't been any better than his own. Set to the haunting Freedy Johnston song This Perfect World this scene would be at home in any respectable drama. As Roy drives through the town his memory returns to the town of his childhood only to dissolve back to it's current desolate state.  In spite of all the laughs and gags this is the scene that resonates. The laughs are present in abundance but don't let that fool you; there is more to this move than that, if you want to see it.",Kingpin

To others this will one of the most crass. Kingpin is a film you'll either love or hate. It's more subtle than ""Dumb and Dumber"" and less commercial than ""There's Something About Mary"". This is the Farrelly Brothers best film. The film pulls no punches and paints some pretty real characters. Our heroes are total losers. Woody Harrelson plays the bitter, balding bowler Roy Munsen and Bill Murray has a riot as the smarmy and salacious conman Ernie McCracken. The script goes from one nasty joke to the next, breaking as many taboos as it can. Kingpin is a combination of all our nasty character traits rolled into one film and that's what I love about it. It's honest and blunt. It deals with bitterness, paranoia and betrayal. Kingpin shows you what happens when people live truly for themselves.

This goes on for a few seconds and then jumps back to the bowling alley and the tournament resumes as if nothing happened. i don't get this scene. i don't know what significance this scene had in the movie and i don't know why they were being sprayed and i was wondering if anyone could possible explain this to me?",Kingpin

Harrelson is fantastic as a hard-done-by bowler who got done over ('Munsoned' is the phrase later used, which is his actual name in the film to his annoyance) and is out for another shot at the big time. His sidekick is an innocent religious countryman whose style contrasts well with all the others - Murray is just great, but could have been in it more. One scene, for me, really stands out. Certainly in terms of Gramsci esque masculine humour - Murray is in a eaterie with Harrelson and tells him to 'go outside and eat that', then he tells a waitress to come back after washing off her perfume, finally he says 'hi' to a fit bird sat across the way.

To me, the Farrelly Brothers are god-like. After my boyfriend and I went to see this in the theater (we swear we saw the R-rated one) we quoted it for days. Bill Murray is absolutely hilarious, as usual. I loved Randy Quaid as ""The Kid"", and Vanessa Angel was fine too, but I gained new respect for Woody Harrelson for allowing himself to be seen looking so BAD. He is very funny, but also very touching at times. The Farrelly Bros. always populate their movies with lovable losers, so I actually care what happens to them.

The more obvious comedy of Woody Harrelson as Munson, and Bill Murray as McCracken, combined with the subtle comical lines of Ishmael played by Randy Quaid, results in non-stop laughs. The addition of the very beautiful and sexy Vanessa Angel enabled a romantic sub-plot to develop with Munson.  Kingpin has a bit of everything for everyone.

On the way from Amish Pennsylvania, Munson shows him the underbelly of bowling, by hustling every lane they go to. To keep it short, cuz its coming back from commercials, the movie is OK until Bill Murray appears on screen, then it becomes AMAZING. Big Ern McCracken is possibly one of the best characters in any movie, he is the sleaziest, cheesiest, and most hysterical character in the movie. With the clear bowling ball with a rose in it, to the rhinestone studded outfits changed after every strike, Big Ern takes this movie from a 4 to at least a 8.

This is before they arrived in Vegas(I THINK)went and got roaring drunk and Ishmael also got the huge tattoo of the Cowgirl on his back.

Years after his downfall, Munson sees a chance to develop Amish simpleton Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) into a champion bowler, reclaiming his professional and financial success.No surprise, Bill Murray is the highlight of the film as Munson's protagonist. In fact, some of the biggest laughs were actually Murray's ad libs.Still, if base humor offends you, you should probably avoid this film. The comedy is decidedly low brow but original and often well executed (Think ""hair gel"" scene from 1998's There's Something About Mary). Generally, I keep this sub-genre on a short leash. Kingpin won me over with its quirky characters and a superb comedic performance by Murray.*** out of ****",Kingpin
175,js8494,The Farrelly brothers best comedy,10,25 March 2004,"Bill Murry gives his most hysterical performance in this wacky bowling comedy. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid are sold in carrying the film, but it is really Murry who steals the show. His disturbing comb-over and victory speech are ones which may never be forgotten. The Farelly brothers to a good job incorporating the Amish theme into the movie. Vanaessa Angel's jokes are lame and her main purpose seems to be eye candy. The storyline is solid and imaginative and will leave you surprised in its conclusion. When I first saw this film, I rewound the tape and watched it over immediately. This film has extraordinary replay quality. With many memorable quotes, you will be talking about this movie for months to come.",Kingpin
176,sean-conley89,Depressing Comedy,3,14 March 2019,"I just watched this for the first time, and I had heard it was good.
I only laughed out loud a couple times.
I was pretty bored.
Its like Billy Madison and the Big Lebowski had a retarted love child.
Woody is funny in a drama, but not as a lead role in a comedy.",Kingpin
177,pirakaren,Holds up,10,17 November 2021,I watch this movie about once every year and it still makes my husband and I crack up every time we watch. Bill Murray is on another level in this film. Instant classic in my family.,Kingpin
178,fitmindfitbody,Jokes that only a 10 yr old would like,2,15 July 2017,"No matter what your chronological age, if you're a 13 yr old boy in emotion, then you might enjoy this humor. I definitely didn't see humor or entertainment in watching a man being held by other men who put his hand in a machine to hack it off. That's for starters. In my experience, males are willing to have sex with any human, object,or animal, and don't truly care about appearance as long as it feels good. Good looks are only necessary when they're out in public. So the idea that this guy would vomit after having sex with a woman because she's unattractive (while she emerges grateful) is unrealistic enough without the tired grotesqueness of juvenile (You said ""Do-Do""!! HAAHAHA) potty-talk afterwards.",Kingpin
