0,MartinHafer,Not exactly enjoyable...but well done.,7,20 August 2021,"This is the second or third film I've seen that dramatizes the events leading to the capture of Adolph Eichmann. However, this one focuses less on how they discovered this evil man hiding in Argentina and more on what happened after he was captured and before he was spirited off to Israel to face a trial for crimes against humanity.Of course, such a film isn't going to be fun viewing but the film is not as intense and filled with much footage of the actions of this monster or the SS. As a result, it's probably a good film to show your older kids or teens...of course, provided you watch it with them and help explain the context for the real life drama.Overall, very well made and worth seeing....and quite interesting.",Operation Finale
1,SnoopyStyle,psychological chess,8,2 September 2019,"It's 1960 Buenos Aires, Argentina. Teenager Sylvia Hermann falls for Klaus Eichmann. He tells her that he is raised by his uncle after his SS father was killed. Unbeknownst to them, her father is secretly a German Jew. The uncle is suspected to be Adolph Eichmann (Ben Kingsley), the architect of the Holocaust. When it's reported back to the Mossad, Rafi Eitan (Nick Kroll) insists on pursuing the fugitive despite reservations. Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac) is a team leader. Hanna Elian (Mélanie Laurent) is the doctor. It's a daring operation to kidnap the Nazi and transport him to Israel for trial.At first, I expected a caper movie. I expected laying out the scheme and overcoming some unexpected hurdles. For the first half, that's the movie and it's not that new. The Argentinian Nazi gathering is very creepy and there is an interesting history lesson. It's pretty good and then it turns into something better at the safe house. It becomes a psychological chess match and that's the more interesting battle. It's a simple good cop, bad cop situation but Ben Kingsley heightens it with his excellence. He's a master of acting. This reminds me a bit of Munich but this is superior.",Operation Finale
2,kosmasp,Find and catch,7,3 April 2019,"Sometimes it is not just about finding someone, or just catching them. It is about how to handle the whole situation. And with ""war criminals"" from the past, some may even argue: is it worth the time and money to catch and old man? What will it bring/achieve overall? Then again, shouldn't they still be held accountable? There are many moral questions attached to this, though the fact that you still have right wingers going crazy and trying to blame foreigners (Jews in this particular instance) is abhorrent.Having said all that, you have a great cast assembled here. Sir Ben Kingsley at the helm but many others ""supporting"" him. It is a tough subject matter especially because it is true. Maybe some things have been heightened (didn't read up on everything that went down), but overall this is quite draining and seems like a logical account of things. So while it may seem slow at times, the tension is still quite high.",Operation Finale
3,ma-cortes,Intense and thought-provoking reenactment about Adolph Eichmann's capture masterfully played by Sir Ben Kingsley,7,28 January 2021,"Straightforward film thad had been previously adapted in similar style , dealing with the famous kidnap and trial of the notorious Nazi officer. After WWII , a lot of essential figures in Hitler's command escaped Germany and were rumored to be living in South America as the nicknamed the Angel of Death : Joseph Mengele . And Adolph Eichmann wanted in connection with milions of deaths is suspected to be living incognito in Argentina and being main responsible of the ""Death Trains"" . Although in the movie Adolph Eichmann is nicknamed the Architect of the Final Solution, the real mastermind was Reinhard Heydrich who was the true promoter of the Conference of Wanshee where was dedided the Jews extermination and there Eichmann was actually an underling.This is a tense and thrilling reenactment of the capture of Eichmann , posing as Richard Klement . The best scenes are when happen the twisted interrogation to Eichmann very well performed by Ben Kingsley . Main and support cast are frankly fine. Oscar Isaac is pretty good, giving a nice acting as the head of the team , determinated to bring the monster to the Israeli Justice . At the same time it deals with the Mossad : Israel Secret Intelligence Organitation under secret orders of Ben Gurion that will stop at nothing and at whatever cost to detain Adolph Eichman and bring him to Israeli justice.

They assemble a team to extract him and bring him to Israel to stand trial as a mass murderer.Interesting true story. Shows how the Mossad investigated the possibility that Eichmann was living in Argentina, how they positively identified him and the planning and execution of getting him to Israel. While you know the result, if you know history, it still makes for very intriguing watching. This is especially as there was a large amount of danger involved in the operation - there was a large element of Nazis and Nazi sympathisers living in Argentina and they had significant influence over the government.The historic element makes this quite edifying viewing too.Great work by Ben Kingsley as Eichmann.

7,ferguson-6,the hunt for evil,7,29 August 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Historical dramas, by definition, carry added depth and weight to stories that sometimes seem almost beyond belief. Such is the true story of the 1960 Mossad mission to capture Adolph Eichmann, the noted architect of the Final Solution, who was hiding in plain sight in Argentina. You might think there have already been enough Holocaust movies, but director Chris Weitz (ABOUT A BOY) hones in on the personal aspects of loss and anger, and the need for justice.Matthew Orton's first screenplay benefits greatly from a terrific cast, especially the two main characters played by Ben Kingsley (Adolph Eichmann) and Oscar Isaac (Mossad agent Peter Malkin). Sir Ben is notably restrained in his performance of the last surviving mastermind of the Holocaust, and one of the most despised men on the planet. His subdued performance aligns perfectly with the ""ordinary"" man of which we've since read. Mr. Isaac adds the element of psychology in his ""good cop"" approach to getting Eichmann to crack.Playing much like a heist movie, we see the team assembled and the quite convoluted plan devised. The high risk strategy underscores the desperation so many felt in their need to see Eichmann pay for his atrocities. The manhunt required some political tip-toeing, and we even gain a history lesson on the role of the Catholic Church. A tip from a ""secret"" Jewish daughter (Haley Lu Richardson) and her father (Peter Strauss) set things in motion. Sylvia (Ms. Richardson) actually dates Klaus Eichmann (played by Joe Alwyn), who is a picture-perfect Aryan carrying on the horrid Nazi tradition of hatred.Of course, Klaus is the son of Adolph, and the one who spills the beans about his father being ""a big deal"" in the war ... thereby ruining the quiet and mostly unassuming life they have been living with Adolph's wife (a nearly unrecognizable Greta Scacchi). Sylvia and Klaus meet at a movie when she shushes him and his friends. Director Weitz even includes a clip of IMITATION OF LIFE (1959), a film that not coincidentally stars his mother, Susan Kohner. It's a nice touch.Much of the film takes place in the safe house where Adolph Eichmann is blindfolded and spoon-fed. It's here that the psychological games and political maneuverings begin. Supporting actors who add strength to the film include team members Melanie Laurent (Hanna), Michael Aranov (chief negotiator Zvi), Lior Raz (as the demanding team director), Nick Kroll, and Simon Russell Beale (as Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion). There is a history of bumpy romance between Hanna and Peter, though it adds little to the story. Alexandre Desplat's score is terrific, especially during a creative and informative opening credit sequence. ""Who did you lose?"" is a recurring question throughout, as it's 1960 and everyone involved lost someone - a driving force behind their persistence and commitment to the cause. The film is focused on the mission to capture, not the details of the subsequent trial; however it does close with archival photos of the actual trial - adding historical relevance to this fine dramatization.",Operation Finale
8,phd_travel,Good in parts but some major faults,6,3 October 2018,"The story of Eichmann's capture has been told before but it is so interesting that it is worth a current high quality feature film remake. It was a bit of a
disappointment. Chris Weitz doesn't do a good job directing. Crucial points are glossed over quickly. Too much prior knowledge of the events and characters is required to follow. The beginning is exciting then the middle is dull when things stall about the signing of the letter. Too much time on this part. It gets more exciting again towards the flight out and the end. Oscar Isaac is so versatile he's convincing as the earnestly Nazi hunter despite not being Jewish. Everybody's favourite Nazi hunter Mélanie Laurent is a welcome presence but her English diction isn't great after all this time. Ben Kingsley has played Otto Frank and now he plays Adolf Eichmann. He doesn't resemble him physically that much. He doesn't have that Teutonic look that was necessary for the role. Worth watching but be prepared to be disappointed by some aspects. The good parts make it worth seeing though. Not as good as the fictional Odessa File.",Operation Finale

The film was directed by Chris Weitz, and written by Matthew Orton. It stars Oscar Isaac (who also served as a producer), Ben Kingsley, Melanie Laurent, Nick Kroll, Lior Raz and Haley Lu Richardson. The movie is a modest hit at the Box Office, but it's only gotten mixed reviews from critics. I found it to be well made, and acted, but it's also extremely slow-paced and lacking genuine suspense. The film is educational at least though.",Operation Finale
12,Lejink,Butcher gets captured by the game,5,10 November 2018,"This film depicts the Israeli Secret Service Mossad's abduction of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann from Buenos Aires in 1960 to where he and no doubt many others of his fellow-countrymen and women had escaped and settled after the end of the Second World War. It is of course arguable as to whether one country should be able to flaunt international law and send in a secret squad to extricate against their will a resident of another country where extradition has neither been applied for or granted. The argument here of course is that the state of Israel in the extenuating circumstances of its Holocaustal suffering at the hands of Nazi Germany, should have the exceptional power to hunt down and try on their soil, parties identified as war criminals.To the film itself, a reasonably entertaining if not fully enthralling or even informative portrayal of an event of worldwide importance. I've done some background reading on the actual event itself and nowhere have I read of the interrogator's trick involved in getting Eichmann to reveal his true identity to his captors, the betrayal of the group by an avaricious young female member of their company or the on-screen nail-biting conclusion where one of their young leaders appears to sacrifice his place on the escaping plane so that Eichmann can be spirited away to Israel.The film is as definite as I believe it should be in showing Eichmann's culpability in devising the ""Final Solution"" extermination programme to kill the Jews it seems almost just to save the bullets used to shoot them all in mass dug-out graves, by showing an explicit flashback of him in military regalia showing no mercy to his helpless captives, women and children inevitably among them. Other inserts I believe, were more fanciful and unjustified by the seriousness of the story being told here, like the hot-headed young leader's tormenting vision of his slaughtered sister.The dramatic heart of the film is the sequence where the captors strive to get Eichmann sign a confession note and the young man talks him into doing so by promising the prisoner a last meeting with his wife before his inevitable death sentence is carried out in the future but somehow what should have had me gripping the sides of my armchair instead saw my hands stay clapped on my knees. Again I wonder, was such a promise ever given and upheld or was it just another implanted plot device by an imaginative screenwriter.The direction was efficient although I could have done without the mild love-interest between two of the group and like I say some of the drama seemed contrived which was the last thing this of all stories needed. Ben Kingsley's the biggest name in the cast, naturally playing the Eichmann part which he does with commendable restraint, but I wasn't engaged enough really by any other cast member besides him.I really felt this super-serious and important real event would have been better served with a neo-documentary approaches rather than make the compromises to make it seem almost like a wartime ""mission impossible"" film entertainment I think it ends up doing.",Operation Finale
13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Dramatically impressive, but strikes the wrong tone",7,24 October 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAt the end of World War 2, Hitler, the chief of the atrocities, and Himmler, his second in command, both escaped justice by committing suicide. However, one man's fate was not recorded, that of Adolph Eichmann (Ben Kingsley), the chief architect of the Holocaust. In 1960, in Buenos Aires, a positive sighting of the man appears to have been made, and it falls on Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac), the leader of a Mossad unit who lost a sister in the Holocaust, to spearhead a mission to capture him and bring him to trial. However, after his capture, Eichmann engages him in a psychological battle that tests him to the limit.The capture of Adolph Eichmann, one of the rare instances when Holocaust survivors were granted some kind of justice and closure, is a true life tale ripe with potential and power, and yet it's never gotten any big screen attention (and probably won't in this watered down, attention deficit age.) However, it has had a notable small screen exploration already, with the 1996 TV drama The Man Who Captured Eichmann, with Robert Duvall, an actor with similar stature to Kingsley, as Eichmann. That such big name actors would be willing to lend their names to such a role speaks volumes about its appeal, but while this has a style all of its own, it doesn't emerge as the superior film.Considering the dark subject matter, the film has too much of a surprisingly upbeat, bouncy tone to it, which puts it at odds with the heavy drama it's trying to convey. Performances wise, Kingsley is as reliably commanding as you'd expect, and has fine support from Isaac as his captor, along with the likes of Melanie Laurent and Lior Raz. But despite some intense dramatic moments, the film never really wraps you up in its drama in the most effective way.Still, it gets everything aesthetically right, and is another inspiring go at bringing such a fascinating story to light. ***",Operation Finale
14,MOscarbradley,This subject deserves better....,4,16 February 2020,"An intelligent, if lugubrious, account of how Adolf Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires and returned to Israel to stand trial. About the best you can say of Chris Weitz's ""Operation Finale"" is that it's a decent history lesson but a poor film with a miscast Ben Kingsley as Eichmann, (at the time the film was set Eichmann was 54 while Kingsley is 76 and looks it). As one of the men who did the actual capturing and who, in this film at least, is seen to form a kind of bond with his prisoner, Oscar Isaac isn't at all bad but everyone else in the cast is just some kind of pawn. What's lacking is any sense of urgency. I hate to say it but the film might have been better if it were less tasteful; it's almost as if everyone connected with the film were afraid to get their hands dirty so it's all handled with kid gloves. Material like this deserves better.",Operation Finale
15,ThomasDrufke,Lacks a Punch,5,6 September 2018,"I love going to see movies that tell a story I was previously unaware of. Operation Finale covers the capture of Adolph Eichmann, one of Hitler's top lieutenants, as he evaded allied forces for nearly two decades following the war. The strength of Operation Finale is with its two leads, Ben Kingsley as the previously mentioned Eichmann, and Oscar Isaac as Peter Malkin, the man heading up the capture of Eichmann. Their scenes together are brilliant, and is perhaps the best Kingsley has been in years. But ultimately this film is about them trying to get Eichmann to sign a piece of paper, and it isn't nearly as interesting as it wants to be. Where Argo enhanced certain aspects of the true story in order to create tension, it felt like Operation Finale lacked that tension, especially when it needed it the most. 5.8/10",Operation Finale

20,paul-allaer,Flawed movie worth watching for the chilling performance by Ben Kingsley,6,12 September 2018,"""Operation Finale"" (2018 release; 122 min.) brings the story of the 1960 capture of Nazi-in-hiding Adolf Eichmann in Argentina. As the movie opens, we are in ""Austria, 1954"" where Israeli intelligence officer Peter Malkin in hunting down a Nazi-in-hiding, but his team ends up arresting and killing the wrong Nazi. We then move to ""Buenos Aires, 1960"", where Sylvia, an undercover Israeli officer, befriends a young man who turns out to be Adolf Eichmann's son. Upon receiving word that Eichmann has been located, the Israeli government decides to undertake a daring attempt to kidnap Eichmann and bring him to Israel. Peter Malkin is called upon to put together a team of specialists... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Chris Weitz, who previously has directed one of the ""Twilight"" franchise movies, and also has written the script for ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"". Here he goes a very different direction, namely to try and bring, once and for all, the definitive movie on how SS Eichmann was captured in Argentina and brought to Israel. Of course one of the biggest challenges facing the movie makers is how to keep a movie interesting when we already know what the outcome will be. One would think that it shouldn't be too hard (good example: Steven Spielberg's ""Munich""), but inexplicably, too many scenes of ""Operation Finale"" simply falls flat. (As others have notd, some of the historical details have been altered/compressed for dramatization purposes.) In the end, I feel this this movie is a missed opportunity, and I can only wonder what Steven Spielberg would've done with this material... There are several things that lift the movie somewhat. First and foremost is the chilling performance by Ben Kingsley as the evil-incarnate Adolf Eichmann. In his first appearance early in the movie, we see Eichmann address a group somewhere in Buenos Aires. When asked why he is speaking in public, he responds: ""to correct the lies that were spread at the Nuremberg trials"", wow, just wow. Kingsley is one of those top-notch actors who can go from portraying Gandhi to now Eichmann (how much more opposite can you get?), and be brilliant each time. Haley Lu Richardson (as Sylvia) does also quite well. Oscar Isaac (as Peter Malkin) is strangely bland. The scenery and set production (in particular the scenes in Buenos Aires) is pure eye-candy. Last but certainly not least, there is a very nice orchestral score by Oscar-winner Alexandre Desplat. The movie got a limited release in August, and has expanded since then. It recently opened on a couple of screens here in Greater Cincinnati. The (discount) Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 15 people). Amazingly, the film will not get a theatrical release outside of the US, as it will be available only via Netflix. If you are interested in a historical drama, flaws and all, or simple are a fan of Ben Kingsley or Oscar Isaac, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Operation Finale
21,Turfseer,Narrative of Eichmann's abduction works better for television than the silver screen,5,7 September 2018,"Operation Finale is based on Peter Malkin's book ""Eichmann in My Hands."" Malkin was the Israeli Mossad agent who actually first tackled the notorious SS leader on a dimly lit Buenos Aires street in 1960 along with a team of Israeli agents who brought him back to Israel where he ended up standing trial (and was ultimately executed). 
One must first ask whether film is the best medium to tell this story. The narrative contains two very exciting visual scenes: the actual kidnapping of Eichmann right outside in his house and later, when he is whisked aboard an Israeli airliner dressed as part of the flight crew, sedated after being given an injection. But the bulk of the drama revolves around Malkin's and Eichmann's conversations while Eichmann is held in a safe house rented by the Israeli team. 
Given those dialogue heavy dramatic scenes, there really isn't a great deal of ""action"" in this story which would make it more suitable for the silver screen. As such, one must conclude that television is a superior medium to tell this story. Unfortunately, director Chris Weitz and newcomer screenwriter Matthew Orton chose to take liberties with the facts in an effort to expand the scope,resulting in what one might term, ""The Hollywood treatment."" 
In actuality, Malkin's story was already adapted for television in 1996, in a drama entitled, ""The Man Who Captured Eichmann,"" starring Robert Duvall as the SS-Obergruppenführer. That version is much more low-key and fact-based than Weitz's new film. For example, Weitz relies on flashbacks to describe the fate of Malkin's sister and her three children, who were murdered during the Holocaust. Those flashbacks suggest she was hanged in a forest but in the TV version, we learn in the more low-key conversation between Malkin and his mother, that she was murdered at Auschwitz. 
While some of the flashbacks effectively convey the scorched earth tactics of the Nazis (there is a scene where hundreds of Jews are murdered in one swoop while lined up in a ditch), Weitz overdoes things by reminding us of Malkin's loss one too many times (for example, Malkin is depicted either hallucinating or dreaming of his sister standing in front of him, while he's on line at Eichmann's trial in Tel Aviv!). What's more we find out virtually nothing about Malkin (played by the handsome Oscar Isaac) throughout the film, as the emphasis again is strictly on the loss of his sister. Isaac is all wrong for the part as he's much more seemingly American than Israeli. 
Instead of relying on the factual details of how the capture team operated in the safe house after grabbing Eichmann, Orton falsely suggests that it was necessary to obtain signed permission from Eichmann to stand trial in Israel. According to an account from Mossad chief Isser Harelin in his book entitled, ""The House on Garibaldi Street,"" he decided that it would be useful if Eichmann signed such a document. But there appears to be no evidence (as suggested in the film) that everything was at the behest of El Al, the Israeli airline, who purportedly insisted on having the letter signed by Eichmann or else they would not cooperate with the Mossad team, and fly Eichmann back to Israel. 
The idea that El Al would refuse permission sounds unlikely and even if they did, why don't we hear whether there was an even an effort made by the Israeli Prime Minister to intervene? Orton has created this non-historical scenario to ramp up the tension-now that it's mandatory to obtain the signature, if Malkin fails to obtain it, all is lost. What's more there's supposed to be a big conflict over tactics-Malkin ""soft"" approach wins out over his rival's insistence that they treat Eichmann harshly to obtain the signature. In ""The Man Who Captured Eichmann,"" the main conflict between the agents was over Malkin's specific plan on how to grab Eichmann (where the cars were to be parked on the street apparently was the main point of contention). 
Even worse is the manufactured scene in which the Argentine police, along with Eichmann's son, are only a minute away from intercepting the team at the safe house and then chase them to the airport where Malkin must leave the plane to get some kind of permit to leave. None of that happened. The Eichmann family did not contact the police and first went looking for him at local hospitals. While local Nazis were probably involved, bringing the police in could have led to the revelation of Eichmann's identity, which they didn't want to do. So all the machinations feel like a retread from Ben Affleck's ""Argo."" 
Operation Finale still manages to create some tension in the scenes where Malkin faces off against Eichmann, played by Ben Kingsley. I actually prefer Duvall's low-key interpretation of Eichmann, pretending to be a non-descript bureaucrat who was only following ""orders."" Kingsley makes Eichmann into more of a cynical, maniacal character, especially when he loses his cool and sadistically reminds Malkin of the fate of his sister who he likens to a woman who he saw in a trench, holding up her baby and killed after the bullet goes right through the child's body. Duvall, in contrast, only shows his bad (fanatical) side when he starts waxing nostalgic about his beloved Fuhrer. Blowing his ""cover,"" as shown in the film, by goading Malkin, appears unlikely. 
I suppose for those young people who know nothing about Adolph Eichmann, Weitz has done a service by re-telling the story. But the Hollywood treatment only cheapens the story-the earlier low-key approach for the small screen worked much better.",Operation Finale
22,jamesrupert2014,Generally well done dramatization of the covert extradition of Adolf Eichmann,7,27 October 2018,"The so-called 'architect of the holocaust', Adolf Eichmann is kidnapped by Israeli agents from his home in Argentina and taken to Israel to face war-crime charges in this generally realistic and well-made historical drama. The story trajectory is fairly simple: Eichmann is recognised, Mossad assembles a plan and a team, the plan is executed and the alleged war criminal is spirited out of Buenos Aires to face trial. Much of the middle of the film is a psychological cat-and-mouse game between two expert manipulators, Eichmann and Mossad agent Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac), each probing the other for weaknesses. The cast is uniformly very good although Ben Kingsley is 20 years too old to play the captive Eichmann (and twice the age of the Eichmann seen in WW II flashbacks). The film is generally an accurate depiction of the events except for the roles of Lotar and Sylvia Hermann (Peter Strauss and Haley Lu Richardson) which are simultaneously simplified and exaggerated, a pointless change of sex for the team's physician to allow a unnecessary romantic subplot, and (similar to 'Argo', 2013), some fanciful last minute nick-of-time heroics. While I know that movies are for entertainment and not for pedagogy, IMO these changes add nothing and only serve to undermine the significance of the story (especially in a world currently obsessed with 'fake news'). If Hollywood's predilection to playing loose with historical facts is not a concern to you, add a point to my rating.",Operation Finale
23,stevendbeard,Interesting But Slow,6,1 September 2018,"I saw ""Operation Finale"", starring Oscar Isaac-He was Poe Dameron in the Star Wars movies, Ex Machina; Ben Kingsley-Ender's Game, Iron Man 3; Melanie Laurent-Now You See Me, Inglourious Basterds and Nick Kroll-Uncle Drew, Vacation_2015.
This movie is based on a true story about how a WW2 war criminal was brought to justice. Ben plays the SS officer Adolf Eichmann, who hid out in Argentina after the war. During the war, he was responsible for what was called, 'The Final Solution', which was basically the extermination of over 6 million Jews-some people like to refer to it as the Holocaust. A team of Israeli secret agents-aka, The Mossad-led by Oscar were the ones that hunted Ben down in the 1960's. Melani & Nick were on the team that wanted him to stand trial in Israel-they didn't want to kill him, well, some of them did, but most of them wanted him to have a trail and face what he had done. The story is pretty interesting, especially with the interrogation scenes and the escape maneuvers, but it is a little slow in parts. During the end credits, there are actual photos shown that were taken during the trial-which lasted about 8 months-so you can see what the real participants looked like.
It'a rated ""PG-13"" for violent images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes.

24,st-shot,Finale finished from the start.,3,2 October 2019,"This latest entry into the Holocaust genre has little wiggle room to excel as a thriller given the world has been aware of its outcome for over half a century. Combined with the fact voluminous documentaries and one commercial film (The House on Garibaldi Street, 1979) have covered the topic Chris Weitz's lifeless direction and Matthew Horton's turgid script turns it into a two hour crawl filled with emotional close-ups and lackluster suspense.At the end of WW 2 Argentine dictator Juan Peron provided safe haven for a multitude of Nazi war criminals such as Klaus Barbie, Carlos Fulnder and Adolph Eichman. When Israeli intelligence confirms that Eichman is hiding out in Buenos Aires they scramble a team to kidnap and bring him to justice. Once kidnapped and being held for extradition Eichman (Ben Kingsley) and his jailer Peter Malkin (Oscar Issac) engage in tense debate regarding their roles in this world.Kingsley looks bored while the limited Issac's pregnant pauses and monotone inflection threaten to put you to sleep at times such as a shaving scene between the two that should crackle with tension. The rest of the cast is made up of moody, melancholy agents and rabid fascists paint by the numbers stereotypes.There are attempts to flesh out characters with interpersonal relationships but a cold mawkishness hangs over this whole film in its flailing attempt to get them beyond cardboard cut-outs with the suspense a done deal.

25,CubsandCulture,Wastes two strong performances,6,6 January 2019,"The story is too straightforward and streamlined. Too much of the film is trying to build tension over the success of the mission but the twists and set back all feel too slight and easily overcome. There are more dramatically interesting ways to tell this story and I think trying to fit it into a thriller mode was a mistake. Maybe a courtroom drama would have been a better fit but the plot keeps butting in when the film seems to be going in an interesting direction, i.e. the interplay between Peter and Adolf. The story isn't bad but it could have been so much more.Fortunately, Kingsley and Isaac turn in some moving understated performances. Kingsley is especially chilling as Adolf and there is weird intertextual irony given his previous role in Schindler's List. Kingsley embodies the banality of evil and it utterly works. Isaac was a good choice to carry the movie.This film was disappointing. It could have been so much more.",Operation Finale
26,jewelch,Did not care for,3,23 March 2021,"I was actually a bit disappointed by this. The beginning is rather clunky, showing moving pictures as you know them from the early stages of film -making and a lot of commentary provided by survivors of WW1 back to back without pause. The moment the image suddenly gets wide and colored is fantastic and the technical feat of transferring all the material to modern viewing standards praise-worthy. Unfortunately the witnesses' commentary offering intrinsic details of every day life on the front can get tiring and hard to understand at times. There are too many voices, in too short an order and soon the images of the dead start to appear. You witness the horrors but you just don't feel it. Does this belong in history class as a deterrence against war? Absolutely. Does it offer anything new beyond the technical side? Not really.

For me ""Eichmann"" the film is by far the most engrossing. It offers a reasonably accurate account of the events that led to his capture, trial and execution, for crimes against humanity during WWII.Operation Finale adds nothing to what has already been told in books and other films. Indeed, I find its representation of the facts pretty thin and the tone awkwardly lecturing and oddly sentimental. A predicament not helped by rather flat, mono-tonal storytelling, that even an excellent cast can not overcome. All in all I'm left asking why we needed another film on this subject?

During their forced stay in Buenos Aires, the agents are forced to keep a watch on Eichman 24/7 and they all dislike the task.Except Peter, who develops some sort of real communication, allegedly to make Eichman sign a paper, in practice to shove down our throats the idea that even the most notorious criminals are human.

30,rgkarim,It's the Finale Countdown,8,29 August 2018,"History teaches us many lessons, but sadly we sometimes are still too stubborn to learn when it things come wrapped in a convenient, shiny package. Still, there are movies still trying to use their bucks to teach lessons in the tales they have to share. Tonight, yours truly attended the showing of the latest historical, biography, drama that hopes to make a mark. What is in store? As always please read to find out as I review: Movie: Operation Finale (2018)Director:
 Chris Weitz
Writer:
 Matthew Orton
Stars:
 Oscar Isaac, Ben Kingsley, Mélanie LaurentLIKES: Pacing: For the most part, a drama like this is often slower than the movies I prefer, yet Operation Finale managed to meet this expectation. A brisk pace that allowed for detail, the audience was more than capable of finding that balance to tell it's tale and not leave me falling asleep. The Class: A Holocaust movie always runs the risk of diving into the dark, deep end of the horror pool, which can be hard to watch. Again, Weltz and his team found the balance of making references to the horrible event, but adding a filter that alludes to the event without showing too much. The result is crafting a piece of work that respectfully shows the events, but not in the distasteful display that many movies relish in. As such, it doesn't downplay the significance it, but rather integrates into the story. The Relevance of Characters: A stuffed group into 2 hours is not easy to do, but Operation Finale made sure to integrate as many of the characters as possible and give a point to their inclusion. No matter how small the role, each character has contributed to the operation in some manner to warrant their time on the silver screen. The History/Moral Lesson: The movie set out to teach lessons, and it certainly did. History comes in a variety of forms, but this movie certainly felt like a visual book (yes I get the irony), still it's an integrated piece of work that achieves the story telling history strives to obtain. And like history, the moral lessons involves are poetically delivered without all the preachy planned speeches Hollywood writers love. It's the realism and musical score that drive all these lessons home, and a fantastic future for using this movie for teaching classes. The Acting: The movie's bread and butter though is the acting. Character integration required a lot of dynamic play off of each other, and our cast was up to the challenge of bringing it to life. At this point, all the secondary/supporting characters get a nod for their work, each member feeling like a part of the team that held their own emotional charge towards the common goal. However, the key pillars of the movie are Ben Kingsley and Oscar Isaac the leads of the film. Isaac trades his X-Wing uniform for a more modest suit, and adapts the strong emotional power of an Israeli Jewish man forced to confront a lot of baggage. It's realistic, powerful, and the anchor to which much of the movie relies on and he rocks it. As for Kingsley, the man is a legend for a reason and he beautifully opens the door of the antagonist role and the complexity that can come with it. Another balance of emotional prowess, the man will keep you guessing at what lies within the dark mind of the German War Elite. The two together play a game of cat and mouse, and while not filled with gun play, or car chases, it's this emotional tug of war that is immersive and kept me into the drama at hand. Bravo to the casting director for bringing these powerhouses together. DISLIKES: The Pace at times: Pacing is mostly good, but there are some slower moments that didn't have quite the oomph that the rest of the movie did. These parts bloated the movie more and didn't quite deliver the punch for me. Small dislike, but it leads me to the next limitation for me. The Length: The movie worked to portray a lot of angles on this historical event. Operation Finale didn't quite need to be over 2 hours for me, with probably at least 20 minutes being edited out with ease. I see where it is going with the length to try and pay homage to those who lost their lives to the greatest tragedy, but in regards to the story it didn't quite need the extra time. Especially, when it comes to my next dislike. The Other Character Stories: A lot of characters were introduced at the beginning, each played up for their emotional struggles to bring the former Nazi to justice. And after a prolonged intro, many of the characters kind of stopped there. Operation Finale showed potential for very deep characters, and while the leads got the most dive into the psyche, the rest of the cast kind of got a fly over. More integration and struggle would have been much appreciated for me to help further bring the group to life. It's not that the others were bad, but by explaining them a little more, the movie might have better utilized the 2 hours it had to have. While the secondary crew accomplished their mission, some more tweaking could have strengthened things. THE VERDICT:  For a historical drama. Operation Finale was one of the better ones to grace the silver screen in recent years. While nothing like the legendary historical dramas that came before it, this film struck a balance I appreciated between historical presentation and dramatizing moments. The two lead actors soared with their chemistry and by working around this entropy favored performance, brought the heart and soul of the cinematic work to life. Still, the movie needs a little tweaking in investing in other characters to justify being greater than 2 hours as well as editing a few things out. Still, this movie is probably a great example of classic story telling, and that element justifies the theater visit despite a lack of Big Screen effects. Still, give this one a try when you can, I think you will enjoy it. My scores are: Biography/Drama/History: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0",Operation Finale
31,richard-1787,A good if not great movie,7,13 September 2018,"This is certainly a fine movie, well made. The acting, especially by Ben Kingsley as Adolf Eichmann, is first rate. (Yes, Oscar Isaac is very good as well, if - inevitably - far better looking than the real life man whom he plays.) The script is also good.My problem with this movie is that it did not deal with the inevitable pitfall of such historical docudramas: we know what the outcome will be, so how do you maintain suspense - if that is what you are going for to hold the movie together? (And that is what this movie tried to use to hold our attention.) This movie never solved this problem. There were moments that were meant to be suspenseful, but since we knew what the outcome would be, the suspense fell flat. We know that, in the end, the Israeli team will get Eichmann out of Argentina and back to Israel to stand trial, so the scenes that seemed to suggest that might not happen just weren't suspenseful, despite the music, lighting, facial expressions, etc. Some of the movie seemed slow and unnecessary, because it was building suspense I didn't feel. The best example of this is near the end, at the airport, when the team is loading Eichmann on the plane for Israel and the Germans are racing toward the airport to stop the flight. Given the way it was filmed, and the situation, you immediately thought of the highly suspenseful end of Casablanca. But whereas in Casablanca - at least the first time we watch it - we don't know if the plane will be able to take off with Victor Laslo before the Germans arrive to stop it, so that there is a GREAT deal of suspense, in this movie there was no suspense, despite the director's effort to create some, because we know the team gets Eichmann back to Israel. Setting the scene up to recall the end of Casablanca did this movie no favors.Where this movie was at its best, and where it could have profited from further development, was in the scenes in which Eichmann plays with his captors, especially Oscar Isaac's character. Granted, if they had been developed further, this would have seemed more like a play and less like a suspense thriller, which is how the trailer makes it out to be. But it would have been a more engaging movie, at least for this viewer.I wasn't bored, but I didn't have any problems going out for a popcorn refill in in the middle either, something I never do in a really good movie, where I don't want to miss anything.",Operation Finale
32,Luigi Di Pilla,Must see,7,18 October 2018,"For two reasons Operation Finale is worth to see. The great performance and chemistry between Oscar Isaac and Ben Kingsley. Then the story is told simply and built up with suspense.
The scenes and settings are well fitted for that time in the 60ties.
It wants also to remember all their terrible sins to the Jewish and that the Nazis have to take responsibility for their cruel acts. The movie was never boring and I watched it on Netflix. 7/10",Operation Finale
33,denis888,When A Promising Idea Just Doesn't Work,3,20 January 2019,"It seemed a very noble and promising idea - to depict a valiant squad of Mossad agents kidnapping a Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann. The cast also seemed to be awesomely strong, with great Ben KIngsley and Ocar Issacs playing two main opponents. The premise is good, the setting is buolic and perfect, with Argentinian landscape being shown so richly and vivdly.
The idea is very serious and must have been executed pretty well.
But then, sadly, many things went wrong.
Painfully slow tempo, very heavy handed delivery, overimposure of weighty dialog, occacionally weaker twists and slighter depicted characters spoil the premise.
Then, alas, then this awful last-moment-on-the-edge-of-your-seat trite cliche at the end spoils it even more.
Steven Spielberg could have made this much better, but he has his Schindler's List, Roman Polanksi caould have been also a better job but he has his awesome Pianist... so here we witness a very messed up dubious affair of lesser level and worse merit.
Pity, as the movie could have been a smash hit a huge triumph. Instead, what we get is a very flawed slowly plodding tractor",Operation Finale
34,bankofmarquis,Very Good Film with 2 Very Good Performances,8,11 September 2018,"The kids are back in school, the leaves are beginning to turn and Halloween is just around the corner (if you believe the displays in the stores), which means it's a ""dead period"" at the Cineplex for decent films. So, the BankofMarquis headed to the ""Art House"" to check out a well made, well directed and well acted post WWII drama - OPERATION FINALE.Set in the early 1960's, OPERATION FINALE tells the tale of Israeli Secret Service Agent's attempt to capture Adolph Eichman in Argentina and bring him back to Israel to face a very public, world-wide trial for his role as the ""Architect of the Final Solution"".In other hands, this film could have very easily devolved into a Jason Bourne-type action flick with kick-ass Mossad agents fighting Nazi-loving Argentinian police (with assists from once and future Nazi's). But, in the hands of Writer Matthew Orton (in his major Screenplay debut) and Director Chris Weitz (ABOUT A BOY) this film becomes something much more, much deeper and much more interesting than that, it becomes a character study between Eichman and Mossad Agent Peter Malkin.The first 1/2 hour of the film starts out ""action-y"" enough, with the discovery of Eichman and the Mossad's planning of the caper that will bring him to justice. We get the ""gathering of the team"" - and there's a couple of interesting characters in this group - specifically the characters played by Nick Kroll and Melanie Laurent - but the film really takes off and finds it's footing when the team - and the film - is forced to slow down (waiting for their escape plane to show up) and coax a confession (of sorts) out of Eichman.So the middle part of this film is really a ""two-hander"" interrogation between Malkin (Oscar Isaac) and Eichman (Sir Ben Kingsley) - and both really bring it. Isaac (EX MACHINA, STAR WARS) shows a sadness and vulnerability as the agent who's life was deeply affected by the death of his sister (and other family members) at the hands of the SS. He is out to nail Eichman for his crime, but discovers a humanity (both in himself and in Eichman) along the way.But the picture really belongs to the performance of Sir Ben as Eichman. This is a larger than life actor portraying a larger than life character and more than holds the audience's attention whenever he is on the scene - and when it comes down to an interrogation of Eichman by Malkin, the positions are quickly switched and it is Eichman who is the interrogator and Malkin is in the hot seat. It's not quite an ""Oscar-worthy"" performance, falling just short of that, but darn good nonetheless.The final 1/2 hour of the film falls prey to the ""Argo"" ending - making a more exciting escape than it was in real life - but that is just a quibble for a really good, really intelligent and really ADULT film. One that is well worth checking out at an Art House near you.Letter Grade A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Operation Finale

36,springfieldrental,Historically Accurate,8,31 August 2018,"Rarely does Hollywood do justice to history when Tinseltown presents its version of events. ""Braveheart"" is a notable example.
However, OF is the rare work that mainly sticks to the actual facts of Israel's Mossad intelligence agents' journey to Argentina to extract one of the most wanted Nazi criminals following WW2. The film does avoid the human dramatics found in a majority of period movies, but I don't think that diminishes the impactfullness of the main story.I read about Adolph Eichmann and the efforts to bring the Nazi to Israel to stand trial. OF hits all the main points of the operation without too much embellishments. Near escapes and a love story are inserted in the plot, but incredibly the movie stays true to the 1960 operation. What I loved about OF, and the point was driven home for me viewing the closing credits showing clips of the actual trial of Eichmann, was the relationship between the German/Austrian and Oscar Isaac, playing the Mossad agent who lost his sister to the Nazi monster. Seeing the real Eichmann, resembling a meek college professor instead of some brute, I understood how Matthew Orton, the scriptwriter, spent a considerable amount of time in the second half to show the communication between Ben Kingsley, playing Eichmann, and Isaac. Despite the agent wanting to kill Kinglsey several times, he had a moments of disbelief that such a man in front of him was capable of running the system exterminating untold numbers of the Jewish population. That, to me, was the most fascinating aspect of the film, watching the interplay between the two.",Operation Finale

Much is sped up before his capture then time seems to slow down for the rest of the movie... like super slow. Some theatrical tools were used to bring in audience attention but they felt a bit cheesy. Love in a top secret Mossad operation?

It was the excellent trailer that took me to the opening day today. It is a REALLY outstanding movie. It is so good that when I think back on it, my mind goes ahead and wishfully inserts supreme actor Liev Schreiber into the cast (he wasn't in it, however - D'oh!). It's that kind of good.The movie is dramatic and intense, the suspense approaches ""unbearable"" (but not quite). One striking feature is there are no histrionics. No manly men bang tables and shout heroic things. That type of hitting the audience over the head with Drama with a capital ""D"" is unrealistic anyway - and very corny. Here everyone acts like real people. Life happens in speaking voices. And yet, without the melodrama the tension the suspense keeps getting wound tighter and tighter - just from the natural circumstances of the commandos' mission. That's how the movie could feel so natural, and how we could get into it so deeply and effortlessly. The plot is unexpected, and even a bit outlandish. It is a true story, though, so one gets the sense of deeper meaning, rather than just some dumb action movie, where the director jacks up the suspense and thrills just to please 14-year-old boys. In fact, there isn't much traditional war movie or thriller style movie action - but it is fast-paced. I saw Mile 22 last week, and liked it, but that was mere button-pushing and manipulated adrenaline. That has its place. This movie, on the other hand, managed to twist me up into knots of anxiety, even though I KNEW THE ENDING; the outcome is historical fact. Didn't matter - I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.When it was over I felt as if I had a deeper understanding of something fundamental about humans.

This story is based on the true story of Adolph Eichman. After the WW2 Adolph Eichman escaped to Buenos Aires, Argentina after World War 2. Adolph Eichman, was one of the head Nazi's who carried out some of the most horrific crimes against humanity. Adolph Eichman ( Ben Kingsley) did an Oscar worthy performance, but was snubbed. He escaped to South America with his wife. He adopted a son, who's father was tracked and killed by Israeli agents in Germany.In Argentina, Eichman works at a factory, and his schedule is like clockwork. It is the early 60's and an Israeli team of agents led by Oscar Isaac ( Peter Malkin) is brilliant. He leads a team of Israeli agents that track down most of those Nazi's that escaped justice, but still needs to find Eichman. Eichman is responsible for the death of his sister, so this capture is personal. So with his agents and a doctor they set out for South America. When they find Eichman, they keep him hold up until they are able to return to Israel to stand trial. When the time comes time to leave things get tense, and they almost get caught by Eichman's son( Klaus) who becomes involved in a new Neo-Nazi movement. They eventually get away and they are headed home. When they get back Eichman's trial begins, it is televised throughout the world in 1962. There the audience sees the ovens, the starving Jews, and various other torturous methods Eichman carried out as a Nazi. In the end, Eichman was found guilty of his crimes and was put to death in a oven built especially for him.This movie is no Schindler's List, but it is one everyone should see, especially for those that believe the Holocaust never happened.

Here are some of the headlines for this movie: ""Great historic accuracy"", ""HISTORICALLY SUPER WRONG"", ""Historically Accurate"", ""historicly incorrect"". It seems like a joke... I am always a defender of historical accuracy in your historical movies and many times I simply cannot understand the creative licenses some movies take to make them more appealing. This is a hard movie to judge on that front because the whole operation is pretty accurate on how it happened, they only changed some details that, as you can see, make some people very angry. Does changing the sex of the doctor to make for some romantic tension better the movie? I don't think so, to be honest, but I also think that most of the important decisions for the story are correct so, in this case, I can forgive these slight inaccuracies. But had they been cut maybe it would have helped the biggest issue I had with the movie which was the running time and some of the rhythm. On a technical level nothing to say, as everything is well done and the acting is very good as expected from the talent involved. All in all I think I can recommend this movie.",Operation Finale
52,Come-and-Review,Too superficial,6,8 October 2018,"Eichmann is indeed one of the most debated characters linked to the Third Reich. Was he just an obeying bureaucrat, or a cruel mastermind? The film doesn't seem to tackle this subject well enough.""Operation Finale"" mostly focuses on Eichmann's extraction by Mossad, Israel's secret service, and only six minutes or so are dedicated to the trial. Obviously, this is justified because of the title, which refers to the mission name used by Mossad for the operation. Choosing this focus, however, did nothing good to the film. Most of the time it felt like a failed attempt at doing an Argo-like thriller. There were elements that felt to be included for the sake of climax, that didn't provide enough excitement, for instance.
I would have prefered seeing a film focused on the trial, where Eichmann's moral ambiguity would have been more central to the plot.
I personally loved the interaction between Kingsley and Isaac, and would cite that as one of the positive elements of this film, although, by seeing the original footage in the credits, I found the real Eichmann to resemble more Mark Rylance than Ben Kingsley (who however did a great performance). Another element I personally really liked was the final scene of the film, a beautiful, silent and meaningful sequence.Is this film a worthy rendition of Eichmann's capture? I'd say it isn't. It seems to me often too superficial: it didn't clarify exactly what Eichmann did (it's false that he was the 'architect' of Shoah: he was the logistics coordinator for the train deportation systems), it didn't deepen the whole 'banality of evil' question that his manners at the trial unveiled, but rather it attempted to be a mixture between Munich and Argo, with mild results.",Operation Finale

Don't bother with this it's not entertaining or instructive, it's a little disturbing as to why it was done, movies aren't made to lose money.

55,PotassiumMan,"Workmanlike, moderately suspenseful retelling of Holocaust justice",7,31 August 2018,"This drama recaptures the Israeli government's bold effort to secretly capture and bring to justice Adolf Eichmann, one of the highest ranking Nazi officials to escape to Argentina after the Second World War. Oscar Isaac portrays Peter Malkin, a Mossad agent, haunted by family loss during the war, who played an instrumental role in the capture of the infamous Nazi war criminal. Ben Kingsley makes a magnetic, creepy portrayal as the reclusive Eichmann who has lived as a fugitive for 15 years. Joe Alwyn offers a sharp supporting turn as the loyal Nazi son of Eichmann.Although this film tackles highly important historical material, its approach can be dry or sometimes even casual. The group of Israeli Mossad agents at work in the extremely secretive and diplomatically risky operation occasionally seem somewhat callow and free-spirited, like a bunch of graduate students cramming for a deadline on a group thesis. This incongruous sense of flippancy is the film's biggest liability and threatens to derail it at times. And the plot thread of a romantic dialogue between Oscar Isaac and Melanie Laurent, a fellow Israeli agent, is wholly extraneous and serves as nothing but a distraction. The film is at its best when depicting the dynamic between Malkin and Eichmann.To its credit, the film has a gripping final act. It starts to look and feel like a hybrid of ""The Debt"" and ""Argo"", escalating the tension to good heights. A heartfelt conclusion is another nice touch. Notwithstanding this film's flaws, I do recommend it for those who are fascinated by this part of history or those who simply like a decent historical film.",Operation Finale

The choice of Ben Kingsley as Eichmann is another poor decision. The melodrama could have been less and the time it consumes should have been allocated to the field acts of the agents.

However, for the sake of drama, some unfortunate wrong impressions are left that make for a poor history lesson.In Israel, people were mostly impressed with Eichmann's unimpressiveness. The leading account is Hannah Arendt's EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM. He came off as a plain, inarticulate, incongruously normal little man. The phrase, ""banality of evil"" came to stand for it.Lately, Sir Ben Kingsley has played a series of memorably evil functionaries. (BACKSTABBING FOR BEGINNERS is a recent example that deserved a better reception than it got.) His articulate, charismatic Eichmann, playing mind games with his captors, is far off the mark. Accordingly, the Israeli agents are played always just one step ahead of the police and the neo-Nazis--a galling injustice to those actual fine, disciplined, professionals.The Israeli agents are tasked to get Eichmann's coerced signature on a specious consent document--like in a 24 episode. Also, there is a local volunteer, Graciela, who is caught by the pursuing posse of Argentine police and neo-Nazis, and interrogated under torture. Neither these events, nor any others raising ""enhanced interrogation"" issues actually took place.Two years later, after Eichmann was hanged, neo-Nazis in Buenos Aires abducted a Jewish girl, Graciela Narcisa Sirota, roughed her up, carved a swastika on one of her breasts, and let her go. The assailants were known, but the police concocted a tale declaring the abduction a charade staged by Communists. Sometimes a hate crime is just a hate crime.I had not known that Operation Finale had been intended to capture both Eichmann and Dr. Josef Mengele. Mengele dropped out of sight, to surface later in Brazil. He was never brought to justice, and drowned accidentally off a gorgeous Brazilian beach while vacationing in 1979. If only because he exhibited essential elements that Eichmann lacked--perversion of a privileged, cultured upbringing as well as science and medicine--he ought to have been the man in the glass booth.

71,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Go watch Argo,4,11 September 2018,"Stop what you are doing, right now! Leave this movie alone and go watch Argo, because I can tell you that is what they did. Operation Finale reeks of the Oscar winning film Argo. There are multiple scenes that almost mimic the film, from fleeing the country in an airport to the local police and government searching for a group of people in a safe house. Which I understand, the best way to be a great movie is to take elements from great movies and put them in your own. However, they had an A-list cast with Ben Affleck at the helm. Operation Finale's big star was an aging Ben Kingsley and then a huge drop off to Nick Kroll. It could never live up to the name.
 Taking a few steps back, Operation Finale follows a team of Jewish agents who are trying to capture and return a Nazi officer back to Israel to stand trial. The movie doesn't do itself any favors, when they start the movie in the second act. As if the movie was too long, or they didn't want another ""Holocaust"" movie, they decided to cut out all introduction, all character basis, and no foundation to be seen. However, they left in the deep emotional scenes with characters relating to their torn past that the audience has no idea about. Many times we are sitting watching characters in pain, or crying, or yelling and just wondering what is going on?
 The director Chris Weitz gave the audience what they needed and what they wanted. No ins and outs or misdirection, the camera was focused on what you needed to see that would move the plot along. The writer Matthew Orton did the exact same as well. Every word was used to advance the plot from point A to point B. No development or originality just bland on to the next lines. Many scenes could be cut and paste from other movies into this weird collage with no originality or backing. All of the pieces were hand-me-downs that were just kind of scattered on a canvas and not even in a creative way, just left there to kind of bend your neck or squint your eyes and try to find the purpose of the film.",Operation Finale

However, given the importance of the subject matter, I wish the writers, producers and directors took it a little more seriously. The most distracting thing about the movie was that they turned what was originally based on a fascinating true story into silly fiction. For instance, of all the vile things the Nazi war criminal did, what he is portrayed as remembering the most is the murder of the sister (and her baby) of the man who captured him, supposedly out of pure coincidence. In addition, the scenes regarding the plane being delayed on the runway, and taking off at the last second, seemed cliché at best (not to mention cut and paste from Argo). They also threw in a fake story line about a sexual relationship between two of the characters because once you go off the rails, why not?

No, but it is definitely worth seeing. Most of the story is fairly accurate. What was created by Hollywood:
-The father of Sylvia Hermann was never kidnapped 
-Sylvia and Klaus were most likely friends (not like this matters though) 
-Malkin was not left behind due to a Nazi/Nazi sympathizer heist that involved Argentinian security (the Argentinians though did 100% protect Nazis) 
-Never read anything about a girl stealing money from the agents 
-There never was a Hanna/Malkin romance (as there never was a Hanna)7/10. I think if they added more at the end of the movie before the credits about other agents involved other than Malkin, that it would have been better as it really was a team effort.If you are short on time and want to read something about Eichmann post the kidnapping, read an interview he did with Life Magazine.

There comes a time in everyone's life where you have to stop blaming others and take responsibility for your own actions.

I also feared that it would be too much like Argo, adding suspenseful action that never occurred. It didn't seem to, at least not too much.So, the film is not really an action movie. You're not going to walk out there and think of all the shootouts (there are none), car chase scenes (none) or 10-minute hand-to-hand fight sequences (once again, none). It's about how the Mossad found, captured and extracted Eichmann from Argentina.

I don't know, but it does hurt the film.The real drama concerning the Operation should have come before the apprehension of Eichman. For a struggling 12 year-old nation like Israel, to mount such a daring and remote operation on the other end of the earth was no small feat.Instead, the drama focuses on what happens in the window between Eichman's capture and before he is transferred to Israel for trial. The biggest problem here is how silly (and utterly untrue) the reason driving this whole drama: The agents have to get Eichman to sign a document giving his consent to be tried in in Israel, or the airline company won't allow him on board the plane!That's right! They flew on a covert mission across the globe, forged identities and passports, kidnapped a Nazi from his home to face justice for one of mankind's greatest atrocities ever committed- but now they must face the biggest obstacle of all: bureaucracy!Couldn't they just forge his signature? The movie gives an incredibly silly answer here as well: ""They don't know what it looks like!"" (but the airline company does)?And so, for half the movie, a battle of wits ensues around a silly event that never happened.In reality, the agents hid in the safehouse because they where bound to the plane's original schedule, and had to endure Eichman for days- which proved to be hard and unsettling. He was so forthcoming with his monstrous crimes and actions that he willingly signed the document- which was of no real consequence (certainly not to the airline company).There are many other details that where altered for the movie, and it's a real shame. The true story was far superior and more exciting.In the end i wonder if this movie does a disservice to the true, amazing, story.",Operation Finale

It is based on the real life Israeli Mossad mission to capture the Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann, 15 years after World War II. Oscar Isaac and Ben Kingsley's back & forth are a Highlight. Though light on action, it has good espionage & intrigue. Like many war movies, there are some disturbing scenes & language. A few fun jokes are sprinkled in to help relieve the black-ops tension. Entertains you, yet leaves you pensive about a great many things: the violent nature of man, the effects of World Wars, do two wrongs ever make a right?

These hidden pockets of history, often both tense and inspiring, have the potential for powerful entertainment.Operation Finale fits squarely into this field. In fact, considering its worthy and recognizable subject matter, it's surprising we haven't seen a film tell the story before. And yet, after watching the movie, you may understand why.Adolf Eichmann (Ben Kingsley)-SS Lieutenant Colonel, logistical mastermind of the holocaust. A powerful Nazi who, unlike his colleagues (Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels), survives World War II and escapes Germany. Eluding Allied authorities, he flees to Austria, then Argentina. His whereabouts remain a mystery until one day in 1960, when a chance encounter between his nephew Klaus (Joe Alwyn) and a German Jew named Silvia (Haley Lu Richardson) renews the hunt.Word soon gets to Mossad director Isser Harel (Lior Raz), who dispatches a team to Buenos Aires. Their mission is to find Eichmann and bring him back to Israel to stand trial. The group consists of de facto leader Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac), Hanna Elian (Melanie Laurent) and Rafi Eitan (Nick Kroll), among others. If they succeed, Jews the world over will experience the catharsis of tangible justice for years of unspeakable atrocities. If they fail...well, as Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion (Simon Russell Beale) briefs them, ""do not fail.""It's a compelling premise, all the more so for being real. In fact, it may be Operation Finale's zenith of strength. This is not a movie of shouting or openhearted fury; emotions reside beneath the surface. But beneath them still is an unshakable sense of justice, even righteousness. To cheer this yearning, this cause, is to be human.Why, then, don't we connect with it on screen as much as we might? The answer may lie within a simple plot point. For reasons upon which the film does not elaborate, the Israeli army cannot or will not fly into Argentina to extract Eichmann. Shipping is too slow. This leaves El Al, the nation's commercial airliner. But El Al won't risk such a venture without a signed note from Eichmann authorizing his departure. Thus, a large portion of the film details the Mossad's efforts to convince Eichmann-perhaps gently, perhaps not-to perform such a seemingly absurd action.It is in this waiting that the movie loses steam, and energy. Much of the interaction takes place between Eichmann and Malkin. Their conversation is genuine, but too often mundane. Will we remember it a week from now? We feel slightly removed from the proceedings; there is little immediacy. Such is the difference between true engagement and mere interest.At the same time, these moments highlight the elevated talent of the film's leads. A sleepy script cannot bury Kingsley's unique projection of darkness and vulnerability, nor Isaac's complex, restrained passion. And the movie's final third resumes the tension and intrigue of its opening.Also evident early on are a few light touches, always welcome within a story of such gravity. No doubt heartily condoned by director Chris Weitz (About a Boy), Isaac and Kroll share more than one laugh-out-loud exchange. Meanwhile, Alexandre Desplat's tricky score serenades with a lithe, playful spark.Operation Finale is the kind of film you see once, admire and appreciate, and probably don't see again. This is not a knock. It's reality for ninety-percent of movies, even the good ones. Cinematically speaking, we only relive what we love.",Operation Finale

144,jonathan_myersstu,Operation Finale Review,10,25 September 2018,"Operation Finale is about the carefully planned extraction of Adolf Eichmann in his hiding place Argentina by a team of Mossad agents in 1960, so that he could be tried for engineering the Final Solution and for the deaths of 6 million people during the Holocaust. However, this extraction proves to be complicated, as various roadblocks face the Israeli team and delay Eichmann's delivery. This is a phenomenally acted and well made thriller. Despite having almost no action, the film manages to be quite nerve-wracking throughout. It almost felt like a real life Mission: Impossible, except without the crazy action or over-the-top villain. It's truly amazing what these men and women were able to accomplish under so much pressure. Almost everything that could go wrong was thrown at them, but through courage and some small sacrifices, they succeeded. What's truly great about this movie more than anything is careful attention the portrayal of these people. Although some characters are put on the sideline, all of them feel like real human beings. Which is good, considering that these people were real and actually captured the Architect of the Holocaust. The two stars are definitely Mossad team leader Peter Malkin (Oscar Issacs) and the Nazi maniac himself, Adolf Eichmann (Ben Kingsley). When the movie focuses on developing these two complex people of different backgrounds is where I think the movie excels the most. This is especially the case when we see them talking to each other, which is a large part of the second half. There's just this depth to both of them that makes some of the slower paced scenes where the two are conversing more intriguing. They are two people with different motivations and values (if you can even say one of them has any values) who have crossed paths and have to deal with one another for an unbearably extended period of time. Although many scenes are dialogue-focused, the film manages to build a steady amount of tension. It's not the EXTREME intensity that movies like Dunkirk or Mission: Impossible build up. Rather, it's more akin to a movie that came out almost 3 years ago: Bridge of Spies (I actually think they referenced the events that take place in that during Operation Finale). The tension does not rely on action scenes; it instead relies on its uneasy atmosphere and the fact that this threat was real to make the movie massively entertaining. And even if you're not feeling the intensity like I was, it will still be a very intriguing story. I mean, these were real spies! This was a real mission! So much was depending on these brave souls, and it truly is remarkable how they were able to capture the man who designed a method of killing millions of their people. And all of pieces for the jigsaw puzzle that is a great movie fit when considering that the performances of these two are some of the best I've seen all year. Ben Kingsley deserves at least a nomination for his thoroughly creepy performance of Eichmann. Oscar Issacs was also spectacular as the lead (but simply can't rival Sam Claflin in Journey's End). The supporting cast also nailed it, making it one of the most solid ensembles of actors and actresses I've seen all year. Even Nick Kroll was surprisingly great and believable.A few final things I enjoyed were the cinematography and score. The way this movie was shot truly helps it stand out believe it or not. I'd go into it more, but I don't want to bore some people. Just see for yourself. And the score was surprisingly more interesting than I thought it would be. Many movies unfortunately have bland scores, but fortunately, Alexandre Desplat made a unique and intriguing score that you will probably be hearing more of come Oscar season. Also, this is unrelated to the quality of the film, but I also was happy to see a portrayal of Israel in film right after I visited it this summer. You must visit it if you can; it's truly a remarkable experience.I can't recommend this one enough. This is a story that is worth telling and a movie that is worth supporting in its box office run.

Apart from these 2 lead characters, it seemed like everybody in the movie were forcing them in acting. I found none in their natural state.Storywise, it was a big disaster. Everything seemed planned and with no real thrill. In their own scenes on camera, everybody has tried to put on a real drama which fails misreabally.Kidnapping of Eichmann, his interrogation at safe house, his sadation to take him to a flight and last fee moments of unexpected delays in flight take off - everything goes very smooth but with artificial exeggeration of acting, emotions and unnecessary drama.It seemed like everything moved too auickly lacking depth. Safe house tenure of Mossad's people, Quickie and tricks in convincing Eichmann in signing letter, Eichmann's quick revealation of his true identity after abduction ... all seemed too quick, under dramatic and hard to grasp, at least for me. Most hillarious moments I found when Ahroni was trying ""hard"" to pursuade Eichmann to sign the letter at safe house. His arguments, his acting, his expressions were rather funny then serious one.Ok, we can say it's an honest try to bring historical event to the knowledge of people but somehow it lacks the real performances, thrills, charms and depth in story.While comparing OF to the other peers, it surely underperforms and not live upto the mark it shoud have been.",Operation Finale

155,giblet-902-940037,To bad could have been a great movie,5,15 January 2019,I am quite sad the writers of this movie used so much dramatic licence and created a mock-docudrama than a well done docu-drama. If they followed the truth a little more and less on the sideline stories of the lead actor character Peter Malkin this would have gotten a better rating from me. Check out the well done movie from 1979 The House on Garibaldi Street--- all around better portrait of the capture of Adolf Eichmann.,Operation Finale

Unfortunately a real life thrilling story becomes pretty much watered in this cliched piece of drama that lacks tension and depth. The cinematography is good though portraying the world of 1960 nicely, which is why I don't condemn this one as complete garbage.",Operation Finale
157,mark-sanfelippo,Kinda all over the place,6,2 September 2018,The movie is ok but the majority of it (probably the first two thirds of it) all over the place or serve no purpose to the plot. The characters come off as stiff and lifeless (some could be removed all together) at the beginning as well as trying to be humorous when it doesn't fit the situation. Ben Kingsley saves this movie from being a real bouts and does a really good job making his portrayal convincing. Could have been really good with more direction in the plot and script.,Operation Finale
158,adikedar,Excellent film,9,23 October 2018,"I'm baffled as to why the low rating. People seem to forget that although it is based (emphasis on the based) on a true story, it is still a fiction film.It's an excellent depiction of Eichmann's capture, told in a concise manner with wonderful acting. While it adds a number of fictional elements to dramatize the film, overall, it manages to capture what was a riveting capture of a war criminal and what it meant not only for Israel, history and Jewish people all over the world - but also to the individual Mossad team members (who lost family members in that war) and who took part in his capture and had to maintain that a secret.It's a wonderful film that I highly recommend to all.

160,sotidim,Respectful to history,7,5 October 2018,"Although people say that the dramatic elements added distorts the history, this is what actually happened. 80%+ of the movie is based on real facts, showing a former Nazi high-ranking officer who was a war criminal, but thinking he was just following orders. This is also crosschecked by the many books and reports from his trial. This is a fine drama, with correct doses of suspense and overall a very nice movie. Recommend to all of you to watch. Cudos to Netflix on a very good production, picturing perfectly Argentina of 1960.",Operation Finale
161,timwbeeker,A Behind The Scenes Look At A Famous Operation,8,7 March 2021,"I know that the actual events would be technically impossible to portray on the screen, but getting to the gist of the spirit of the operation is very well done. The movie is just two hours long, but to do the story true justice, it would have had to have been twice as long. The last five minutes of the movie justifies it all, though.The repeated views of the Germans taking the civilians out into the woods... It sets it all in mind as to what the agents had to deal with in holding back from what they really wanted to do to the man. This makes the mission all that more tense.I see a lot of nit-picking in other reviews. Some even border on something that might show up in a Dunning-Kruger study. Watch the movie and remember, the events truly did happen, regardless of how they are portrayed on the screen. Watch for Peter at the very end of the movie.",Operation Finale

 I know the story well and have seen other film/documentaries about it but that didn't stop me feeling that this one did offer something new and was engrossing throughout with some very good performances, most notably by Ben Kingsley. 
Yes I am sure the somewhat melodramatic chase to the airport at the end was exaggerated (if it happened at all - it would reminded me a little bit of Argo) but that shouldn't take away the importance of this piece. The central storyline about the operation to capture Eichmann , the importance of doing so and the moral dilemmas faced by his captures whose understandable instinct for revenge had to be outweighed by their desire to see justice done kept me watching throughout.
A very decent film about a subject that can never be allowed to be forgotten.",Operation Finale

They basically disregarded all the interesting bits of history and put amazing emphasis on those parts of the storyline that are clearly invented (by a teenager on steroids, I would add).

178,downey-40482,PC bows and caricatures,6,3 September 2018,"It's good to see this subject being revived. But as for the movie, I'd recommend reading Neal Bascomb's book and calling it good. 1) The movie creates out of whole cloth a female doctor/love-interest for Peter Malkin. The mission's real doctor was a man, not so tied to Malkin in the story line. Also, Malkin deserves a lot props, but pro'ly not all the props. 2) The movie portrays Argentine Nazi expats as caricatures like Henry Gibson's tribe in ""The Blues Brothers."" Bascomb seems to indicate the underground Nazis in Argentina were ambivalent at best about Eichmann. That ambivalence really highlights how far the wretch had fallen when they finally grabbed him, and makes his case far more interesting as study of evil. But the movie didn't even try catch that angle of the story.",Operation Finale

My guess is that producers thought that making a Nazi movie would be easy to sell. It is nice to see that Hollywood doesn't buy any movie and this bad movie went straight to Netflix.",Operation Finale
182,nathanrmetzger,A thriller with a dragging middle,7,19 September 2018,"Chris Weitz's Operation Finale is a suspenseful movie through, but suffers from a slow and dragging second act. Operation finale is not your average movie relating to World War Two, instead of focusing on the action and loss of life on the western front, or the tragedies in the holocaust, it focuses on the hunt for Ben Kingsley's Adolf Eichmann; the only remaining SS officer that didn't commit suicide at the end of the third Reich's power. Though the first act starts off slow, starting in Argentina, and switching back and forth between there and Tel Aviv; going between the story of Fruma played by Rita Pauls, a Jewish girl who gets entangled with the investigation, one of the few people who knows Joe Alwyn's character, Klaus Eichmann. Through the first act they go between setting up the safe house to hide Adolf Eichmann until they can transport him out of the country to stand trial in Jerusalem, and scouting out the man's almost perfect schedule that he follows every day. Though this first act is slow, they keep you interested by the steady progression to the day they capture him which is one of the three big action scenes that each ack ends with.
 The second act is this movie's big weakness, a lot of it dragging on slowly during the process of trying to get Adolf Eichmann to sign a paper showing he's willingly going to Jerusalem to stand trial; after their flight gets canceled until they have proof that Eichmann will go to the trial willingly. Not only is the second act the slowest part but it personally made me feel rather uncomfortable given it tries to make you feel bad for an actor who's portraying the man who was one of the main reasons the Holocaust happened, and also was one of the head people in charge of the process of deporting the Jewish people to ghettos and concentration camps. Through the second act, the group of people interstate him, and try to no avail to have Eichmann sign the contract. But Oscar Isaac's character Peter slowly gains his trust, treating him humanely, convincing Eichmann that he'll get a fair trial when he's in Jerusalem. This act is solely focused on the bond that Peter and Adolf create even though they have very different views. When the rest of the act is chugging along it felt boring, it made the two hour movie almost feel like it added another hour because a lot of scenes that could have been left out.
 The third act finally picked back up the speed in the story bring the plot to a tension filled climax. It also contained one of the most memorable and disturbing scenes, where Eichmann decided to use the information that Peter had told him to emotionally destroy him. Although that was the only large emotional scene in my opinion that was worthy for the film, the rest of the third act was filled with action and tense scenes. Soon after the aforementioned scene Eichmann's son and a large group of other NAZI sympathizers come to the safe house where they were to confront them. They get out but not without leaving two of the people behind and head to the airport, being trailed by them. The big climax of the act was the rush at the airport to get the plane off the ground after a guard in association with the sympathizers stole their clearance. Now although that doesn't sound very interesting, the film found a way how to make it extremely intense, showing different perspectives as Klaus moves in on the plane, the mad rush to get a copy of the papers from the planes to the air traffic control and the crushing anxiety of the people on the plane. As they nearly escape, the movie resolves with a scene of Eichmann behind bars having his final wish fulfilled before his trial.
 In conclusion Operation Finale is an amazing movie with lots of tension, but nearly fell flat because of it's near lackluster second act, and only was able to redeem itself by it's intense and action packed third act. In the end I'd have to give this move a 7.8/10",Operation Finale
183,normansegall,Dull.,3,8 October 2018,"Perhaps if one doesn't know the story, this could be a mildly absorbing film. If you do know the history, even at a superficial level, this film is basically dull, and annoying in parts. Particularly the banal verging on shamefully sanitised treatment of those scenes that purport to exemplify the horrors of the Holocaust, And no joy to be found in any of the other cinematographic categories either. Typical example; the Israeli agents speak with odd ""foreign"" accents to some how add credence to being Israeli, yet the Nazi (Ben Kingsley) speaks in pristine British English. So if it pops up on your Netflix screen and you have nothing better to do and with low expectations, it will fill 2 hours of the day. Otherwise give it a miss.",Operation Finale
184,gcklech-29161,Really not good,3,5 November 2018,"The acting is fine but the movie's mostly pretty dull. The thing that got me the most is that they seemed to be trying to combine Eichmann with Himmler as there were some serious historical inaccuracies in the film. Adolf Eichmann was not the 'architect of the Holocaust' - that was without a doubt a combination of Hitler and Himmler with the assistance of Heydrich. Also, Eichmann NEVER attended the shootings of the Einsatzgruppen. Himmler, however, did and it was direct exposure to these atrocities that caused him to reconsider the manner in which the Jews were dealt with - and purely to protect the mental state of his men. and not those being shot in pits.As others have stated I thought the whole central focus on the sister and the killing of her children was a bit daft, and the part where the van rear doors were opened up and a literal flood of Jewish corpses were exposed was bizarre. I know this was intended to show the operation of the gas vans, but the implication that people were wedged into the back of these in tiered layers was just off the charts mental.So, essentially the movie was pretty dull, the acting fine, but they certainly didn't make the most of the story of Eichmann. As someone else stated they'd have been better concentrating on the trial itself and his statements about the Nazi regime.",Operation Finale
