0,SnoopyStyle,finding dumb and dumber,4,30 October 2018,"Audrey (Mila Kunis) and Morgan (Kate McKinnon) are long-time best friends in L.A. Audrey is still recovering from getting dumped by boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux). Unbeknownst to her, he's an international superspy.I hate to point out some of the stupid and illogical plot. Audrey is literally holding the gun that killed two people and somehow the police knew to take away the actual killer. It's a small sample of the illogical writing. That's all immaterial to this movie since most of the issues center on the two female leads. They are not that funny and not really appealing. McKinnon tries her best to be wacky. Kunis' inherent meanness is not being overwritten by her cuteness anymore. She could still be funny if things go wrong for her. A flustered Kunis is funny. There is one scene where the female assassin is ordered to kill the two dumb American girls and she's flummoxed by the plentiful number of idiot girls in her scope. That's who they should be. They should be Dumb and Dumber or Romy and Michele. McKinnon can do it but Kunis can't. The pairing seems wrong. They are not dumb enough to do what their characters are doing. They are also not dumb enough to be funny. A really simple example is the closing credits extra. Normally, they're some of the funniest cuts but not in this case. Most of the comedy is landing flat except for the torture scene. That has a funny back and forth with the female gymnast assassin. The pairing is off in this one.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
1,boblipton,Disappointing,5,15 July 2020,"I was looking forward to this movie. Milas Kunis is a cute, dependable leading lady in comedies and Kate McKinnon has never failed to be very funny, even in blah movies like Rough Night. The premise, in which Miss Kunis is the girlfriend of a Bond-like superspy who... well, you get the idea, and Miss McKinnon is her best friend, and somehow they wind up in Europe in the middle of spy capers, seemed like a pat but promising situation.However, something went, if not wrong, then not particularly right, and director Susanna Fogel seems more interested in the actual workings of the plot and the beauty shots of European cities than in efforts at comedy, although Jane Curtain and Paul Reiser as Miss McKinnon's parents have good bits.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
2,nogodnomasters,Sometimes the sweetest pleasure comes when you are not enjoying yourself,8,30 August 2018,"Audrey (Mila Kunis ) is celebrating her birthday with her best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon ) and not her ex-boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux ) is a spy unbeknownst to her. Morgan is a ""little too much"" and makes friends with men very easily. Audrey is a little more reserved. The two women get involved in spy shenanigans as they travel to Europe where they are soon wanted for murder. This is a comedy spy picture where are two untrained spies don't ""luck"" into things like Bill Murray, but rather plan things quite well. Mila and Kate created great onscreen chemistry, but I kept imagining Melissa McCarthy in both roles and what a riot this film would have been had she played either one. Guide: F-word. Fake male nudity from behind",The Spy Who Dumped Me
3,kosmasp,Women Buddy Comedy,8,20 November 2018,"What has worked for men (mostly in the 80s and 90s) in the Buddy Cop movie ""genre"" (it's not really a genre, but you catch my drift). Now some may feel this is a blast from the past and that either works in favor of the movie or against it. One thing is for sure: It is quite raunchy, as are many other comedies of the same ilk/blueprint.The chemistry is there and while you may find some things annoying (or Kate's character to be specific), I'd argue all works in favor of the movie. And it is heighten reality, even if it sometimes grounds and stays in reality. So it is a mix of both, a really good one. And some of the stuff is just hillarious. Comedy is alway in the eye of the beholder, so it may differ from your taste - it's still more than well done",The Spy Who Dumped Me
4,jboothmillard,The Spy Who Dumped Me,6,27 August 2018,"We'd had The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, The Spy Who Loved Me, and The Spy Who Shagged Me, and this was the next in the flurry of this hit title combination, I hadn't seen any trailer, but the poster, stars in it and positive critics' reviews were good enough for me to try it. Basically Audrey Stockton (Mila Kunis) spends her birthday upset after being dumped, by text, by her boyfriend Drew Thayer (Justin Theroux). Her best friend and roommate Morgan Freeman (Ghostbusters' Kate McKinnon) convinces her to burn Drew's things and send him a text as a heads up. Unbeknownst to Audrey, Drew is a government agent being pursued by men trying to kill him, he promises to return and asks her not to burn his stuff. Audrey works as a store cashier, she flirts with a man, he takes her outside, he is he tells her he is Sebastian Henshaw (Sam Heughan) and that Drew works for the CIA and has gone missing. She claims she hasn't heard from him and returning home she tells Morgan that Drew is a spy, having seen proof. Then Drew returns to Audrey's apartment to retrieve his possessions, including a trophy, soon people outside start shooting into the apartment, during this Drew tells Audrey they must give the trophy to his contact in Vienna. Drew is then murdered by a man that Morgan met in a bar, also a spy, Morgan kills him, pushing him off a balcony, before he can kill Audrey. After fleeing the apartment, Morgan convinces Audrey they should go to Vienna, at the airport they buy several replica trophies as decoys. Once there, at a café Drew told them to go to, Sebastian appears and demands the trophy, she hands one over before the entire café is attacked. Audrey and Morgan flee the scene and are chased by men on motorcycles, but they manage to escape. Morgan calls her parents Carol (Jane Curtin) and Arnie (Paul Reiser) who tell her to go to Prague where she and Audrey stay with family friend Roger. They manage to steal two passports from a pair of young female tourists, on the train to Prague, they realise the trophy contains a USB flash drive in its base. Audrey and Morgan make it to the apartment but realise that ""Roger"" (Fred Melamed) is a spy who has killed the real Roger and drugged them. They try to hide the USB stick by swallowing it, this fails, so Audrey tells their captors she flushed it down the toilet. In an abandoned warehouse, the girls wake and are tortured by Russian gymnast and assassin Nadedja (Ivanna Sakhno), Morgan tells stories of how close she and Audrey, hoping to have Nadedja relate. About to die, Audrey and Morgan are finally rescued by Sebastian, who has defied his partner's orders to try and save them. He takes them to meet his boss Wendy (Gillian Anderson) in Paris, they once again tell both the CIA and MI6 that the drive was flushed, the women are given tickets back to America and Sebastian is put on leave. On the way to the airport, Sebastian explains that Drew's ""parents"" Tom (James Fleet) and Marsha (Carolyn Pickles) that they met previously are actually notorious criminals; Drew was negotiating with them to get the flash drive, and Audrey came along as part of his cover. Audrey now feels she can trust Sebastian, she tells him and Morgan that she didn't flush the drive, but instead hid it in her vagina, Sebastian is unable to decrypt the file on it. Morgan calls Edward Snowdon (Tom Stourton), who she met in summer camp, to help them hack the drive, once decrypted, it is full of information which can be used for blackmail. The trio travel to a hostel where they are attacked by Sebastian's CIA partner Duffer (Hasan Minhaj), who is trying to obtain and then sell the drive, their roommate rescues them, who thinks they are being robbed. Using Duffer's phone, they confirm they have the device and pretend to go forward with a deal to sell it, this will take place at a private party. Audrey and Sebastian disguise themselves as the Canadian ambassador and his wife, while Morgan pretends to be a member of Cirque du Soleil. At the event, Sebastian is attacked, and Morgan goes up against Nadedja on an acrobat swing, she eventually falls to her death onto the nearby set. Audrey goes to meet the mysterious contact to make the deal and stop the murdered, it turns out to be Drew, still alive, he says he fought to be able to see her but acts suspiciously. Sebastian arrives as Drew goes through Audrey's bag looking for the flash drive, he is being held hostage by Tom and Marsha, after a standoff, they are shot, leaving Sebastian and Drew accusing each other of trying to hurt Audrey. Drew shoots Sebastian, Audrey pretends to be grateful for his protection before grabbing his gun, Drew tries to attack her, but Morgan stops him. Drew is arrested, and Audrey, Morgan, and Sebastian walk away, Morgan later calls her parents on Sebastian's untraceable phone to tell them she is alive. Morgan receives a call from Wendy telling her that Sebastian is off suspension, Morgan begs her for a job as a spy, meanwhile Sebastian and Audrey share a kiss. A year later, the girls celebrate Audrey's birthday in Japan, but the party is actually a ruse, Audrey and Morgan are on a mission having finally become real spies. Also starring Trapped star Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Finnish Backpacker, Ruby Kammer as Aussie Tourist #1 and Genevieve McCarthy as Aussie Tourist #2. Kunis and McKinnon are great as the best friends who wind up embroiled in escalating conspiracy and intrigue, McKinnon gets most of the best laughs, and Anderson does well in her short time onscreen being the M-like secret service boss. I will admit the story didn't quite go the way I was expecting, but that's not a bad thing, there are a good number of sequences filled with high-pace chases and guns blazing that are exciting, and the jokes are witty enough and work fairly well, all together it a fun action comedy. Good!",The Spy Who Dumped Me
5,paul_haakonsen,"Spy vs spy, well, sort of...",7,19 May 2020,"First of all, I must say that I was genuinely surprised at what ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" turned out to be. Sure, I knew it was a comedy, given its synopsis and because it starred Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon. But I was actually just expecting it to be another run-of-the-mill mass-produced comedy. So I wasn't sitting down with much of any expectations in 2020 when I finally got a chance to watch this 2018 comedy from writers Susanna Fogel and David Iserson.Turned out that ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" was actually a blast of a movie. The storyline was very enjoyable and had enough twists and turns to it that it wasn't a movie that was just trotting out a straight path. It actually takes jabs at your attention and ability to predict the unpredictable. So director Susanna Fogel definitely succeeded on that account.The comedy in the movie was good, especially because it was mixed up with enough action to make it quite nice and enjoyable.And the movie had a good cast. I must say that both Kunis and McKinnon actually carried this movie quite well. And it was nice to see the likes of Gillian Anderson, Jane Curtin, Paul Reiser and Ivanna Sakhno in the movie as well.I was genuinely and thoroughly entertained by ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"". And if you enjoy spy comedies, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch this one, if you haven't already.My rating of ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" is a solid seven out of ten stars.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
6,BandSAboutMovies,Not bad!,5,17 April 2020,"Susanna Fogel wrote and directed this film. She also was the writer of Booksmart, which is a movie I recommend you check out.It's all about Audrey Stockman (Mila Kunis), who is dumped by her boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux) via text. Her best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon) convinces her to burn all of his stuff, but she soon learns that he was a spy. Now, she's thrust into the world of espionage.This is a fun movie, filled with everything I love from spy movies. I really liked Ivanna Sakhno, who played Nadejda, a gymnastic hitwoman. There's a great fight between her and McKinnon that was a blast.There are also some great cameos, like Gillian Anderson as the spy boss Wendy and McKinnon's parents, played by Jane Curtin and Paul Reiser. Working in Edward Snowden was also pretty fun, too.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
7,writers_reign,The Spy Who Sent Me Up,6,26 August 2018,"I knew next to nothing either about this movie in general or anyone - stsrs, writer, director - connected with it (as I watched it I recognized James Fleet and Gillian Anderson in supporting roles) but it did seem like the best of a bad bunch of new releases. What I enjoyed most about it was the fact that the violence is as real as anything in Bond, Bourne, Mission Impossible et al but it comes complete with gags - for example there is a chase seen as good as the ones in French Connection, Bullitt or the latest Mission Impossible (still playing) but again it is laced with gags which add a new dimension. Although I wouldn't necessarily want to see it again it did beguile the time pretty well.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
8,neil-476,Likeable and funny,7,9 September 2018,"Audrey's boyfriend drops her into the middle of international espionage, leaving her and oddball friend Morgan on the run across Europe from counter-spies and assassins.This female buddy comedy casts Mila Kunis as the straight guy and Kate McKinnon as wacky comedy partner, and this double act works very well: the two women have great chemistry. McKinnon, given a broad character to play, throws herself into it with gusto, and she - and we - have great fun.The story works satisfactorily as a spy yarn with plenty of bluff, double bluff, characters not being who you expect them to be, and surprises (most of which are easily foreseeable).The script is funny - not side-splitting, but rib-ticking. It is unnecessarily full of expletives - the film would have worked just as well without them. The characters and the film are likeable, and there are some attractive European locations.There are plenty worse comedies than this one.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
9,morrison-dylan-fan,The Spy Who Left Me,7,24 July 2019,"With a friend having a birthday soon,I looked for a flick we could both watch together on the day. With her having enjoyed A Simple Favour (2018-also reviewed),I decided to go for another Comedy which came out at the same time,and found out who got dumped by a spy.View on the film:Going on a mission together,Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon give bubbly turns as Audrey and Morgan, thanks to them being friends in real life being visible in their improvised exchanges and a lively excitement to the Euro Spy action scenes. Adding an old fashion touch of class, Justin Theroux and Gillian Anderson send-up 007 archetypes in smooth ladies man/agent Drew,and icy head of spy agency Wendy.
Whilst some of the improvised riffs could have done with a trimming to make some jokes tighter, co-writer/(with David Iserson) director Susanna Fogel & cinematographer Barry ""Game Night/the Jump Streets"" Peterson keep the atmosphere fired up with slick Action scenes, spinning from frantic car chases across the capitols Europe,to bone-crunching gun fights and acrobat combat. Mixing Slap-Stick/improvised Comedy with slick Action and riffs on the Euro Spy genre, the screenplay by Iserson and Fogel do well at making this a successful mission, by keeping the funny antics pinned to the fish out of water status of Audrey and Morgan,which gets them entangled with a spy who gets dumped.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
10,phd_travel,Funny duo in Europe,8,17 January 2019,Both Mila and Kate's talents are used well in this European trip spy comedy spoof. The car chase fights are funny and the violence is comical and original. Laugh out loud at times and unexpectedly so. It's not easy to be originally funny but they are here.,The Spy Who Dumped Me
11,Aaron1375,Just needed to know when to quit.,5,19 April 2020,"My wife was picking movies to watch and she asked me if this one would be alright, and I enthusiastically said sure. So what I got for that sure was a movie that started to catch my attention and be somewhat humorous, but then kept going to the point it is the same length as a James Bond film with just as many twists and turns and it becomes less funny as it continues to move forward. Basically, it had an alright concept, but just continued to go on too long making it less and less entertaining as the reason I was enjoying it was the two friends barely making it out of scrapes, not them suddenly becoming badass and upstaging actual spies with years and years of service.The story has a woman dumped by her boyfriend and as in the title he was a spy. Well, his stuff is still at her and her roommates house and there is something of great importance in his stuff. She soon finds herself being hunted by a multitude of spies and CIA agents as they try to evade capture and deliver the package to the hands of someone in Vienna, Austria.Mila Kunis and the person playing her best friend are good at first as they do not seem to know what is going on and survival seems like a long shot. However, after they get captured and tortured by the weird gymnast assassin the movie is all downhill to me as it begins running long and too many illogical twists as I am sure an agency would have their agents well vetted and in all likelihood know if one of their agents is working for the other side. That and the girls all of a sudden know how to fight and disguise themselves and such and become almost like agents with no training really drained the comedy from this one.So, this film had its moments as it was at its funniest when the girls were running from the multitude of agents and such. The funniest part for me the part where they try to commandeer a car only to learn it is a stick. The problem started occurring when the film felt like it had gone on enough and then it kept going, this is a comedy, to me super long comedies become less funny as the edge begins to wear off and I found that the case with this film. Trim about 20 minutes from it and end it more realistically and it might have merited a higher score from me.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
12,Hellmant,I found parts of it to be very funny,7,31 August 2018,"'THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An action-comedy spy flick about a woman who finds out that her ex-boyfriend is a spy, and then her and her best friend become involved in an international conspiracy because of it. The movie stars Mila Kunis, Kate McKinnon, Justin Theroux, Sam Heughan, Hasan Minhaj and Gillian Anderson. It was directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel. The film has gotten mixed reviews from critics, and it's also performed very modestly at the Box Office as well. I found parts of it to be very funny, and I actually enjoyed some of the action scenes in it as well. It's not great at either though (action or comedy), but it's got enough good scenes of both to make the whole movie worthwhile overall in my opinion.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
13,FeastMode,my notes,5,27 July 2019,"Pretty entertaining, surprisingly good action scenes, some very funny parts, but also lots of dumbness and cliches and general ridiculousness (1 viewing)",The Spy Who Dumped Me
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,What can I say? I had fun with it.,7,1 September 2018,"'The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018)' is a fun, if not particularly funny (though it does have its moments), action-comedy that wastes no time in throwing its two leads headfirst into a high-strung, silly spy plot that doesn't so much spoof the genre as it does fit comfortably within it. Though the narrative takes a number of turns that are expected and - at this point - clichéd and does start to wear thin eventually, the experience is usually an entertaining one throughout. I will say that Kate McKinnon can sometimes be, as her character is told at one point, a little much. Her over-the-top, brash style of improvisational comedy can become grating when it's allowed to run free. That's not to say that she's bad; she brings a life to proceedings that would be missed if it weren't there and plays pretty well off Mila Kunis, with their relationship always feeling believable and somewhat endearing. Thankfully, the film itself typically keeps everything moving, too, so that all of the jokes and otherwise ad-libbed asides are in line with its characters and story. This tends to lead to a loose but 'realistic' and forward-moving style that always serves the narrative. Look, it's no masterpiece and it has its problems, not least of which being the fact that it starts to drag somewhat in its latter half. However, despite this (and its criminally bad title), I actually enjoyed it to a surprising degree. I had fun with it and, in the end, that's all that really matters. 7/10",The Spy Who Dumped Me
15,dromasca,good in-flight entertainment movie,7,21 November 2018,"I am no great fan of watching movies during flights, but I made an exception during my recent 10 hours + intercontinental trip. 'The Spy Who Dumped Me' seemed to me the right stuff to entertain me for a couple of hours with the short breaks for the drinks and meal service. I was not mistaken. The action comedy directed by Susanna Fogel is amusing, sexy, and reasonably well written, thus I did not feel my intelligence insulted or my personal standing endangered by sharing with you friends that I watched it and enjoyed it.Audrey and Morgan (Freeman, but not the one you expect) are two LA ladies, rather failing in their personal or professional lives, who become suddenly involved (because of the ex of one of them, of course) in a violent international spy intrigue. It does not take more than a few minutes for the light Californian comedy to turn into an action blockbuster which will take our heroes to several photogenic cities of Europe, and for the two peaceful and sort of funny girls to become killing machines competing with 007 or Tom Cruise heroes. All this with innocent smiles and the self humor that turns the (most of the) Americans lack of understanding of the outer world into a subject of comedy since Mark Twain invented the American tourist comic travel genre.The combination of (very) violent action movie and European road films, having the two nice Californian girls as principal heroes works quite well. Nothing is ground-breaking in this film, but all is made in good spirit, without pretending to be anything else than entertainment. Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon are perfectly suited for the mission, and the presence on screen of Gillian Anderson is a bonus. I dare recommend this film for any flight that you will take in the near future, and maybe also if you are not flying but just enjoy watching from time to time action comedies.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
16,cricketbat,This movie forgot how to comedy,4,31 December 2018,"I think The Spy Who Dumped Me forgot how to comedy. Instead of actually trying to write witty dialogue or a humorous storyline, this movie tries to evoke laughter by shocking the audience with brutal violence and crude jokes. The whole thing feels slapped together and leaves a lot to be desired, which is a shame, because it had potential.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,4,15 October 2018,"The Spy Who Dumped MeThe easiest way to tell you're dating a spy is if they interrogate you during sex.Sadly, the dumpee in this action-comedy won't have a light shone in her face any longer.Dumped by her globetrotting boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux), Audrey (Mila Kunis) and her friend (Kate McKinnon) go to his house to trash it but are interrupted by armed man. Now aware that Drew's a spy - and in possession of a desirable flash-drive - the women fly to Europe to return the Intel. But when Drew goes missing the friends must then trust is his CIA partner (Sam Heughan). Featuring some of the worst jokes ever written, yet riddled with some brilliant bursts of rapid-fire violence, this buddy-comedy is quiet the dichotomy. Nevertheless this contrast is too distracting and both leads are annoying.Besides, who wouldn't date a spy? You get to taste all of their meals for poison.

19,The-Sarkologist,"Sort of fun, sort of samey",5,13 August 2018,"It seems that I found myself watching what is effectively a 'chick-flick' crossed with some sort of spy thriller. Actually, thriller is probably not the best way to describe this film because it is supposed to be a comedy, except that I didn't find it to be all that funny. Basically, this film pretty much has all of the tropes that you would expect from such a film - a couple of clueless protagonists who find themselves caught up in an adventure that is basically way over their heads, and eventually coming through. Actually, I probably shouldn't have been all that surprised to discover that they end up becoming spies, though I suspect that it generally isn't that easy to be recruited into such an organisation.
 So, we have our hero, or heroine is you want to be technical, and old fashioned, who has been dumped by her boyfriend. She's understandably upset and proceeds to burn all of his stuff, though she does tell him first. Well, that gets his attention because it turns out that not only is he a spy, but he has some secret documents hidden amongst his stuff. Oh, and also not surprisingly he ends up getting killed, and sending the two girls on a whirlwind trip of Europe.
 Honestly, I don't think there is all that much with this film. Sure, it starts off as rather fun, and I didn't actually mind it all that much. It is sort of fun, but not in the way that some of the older films were actually fun. In a sense it is just another one of the cookie cutter films that is being churned out at an unbelievable rate these days, and considering the number of people in the cinema, I'm not even sure if it is going to end up making all that much.
 As for whether you should see it, it depends. It sort of depends not just on whether you like this type of film, but whether you can put up with a couple of really clueless people acting silly for a couple of hours, and also deal with the occasional crudity. Honestly, if you are looking for a good old spy movie, then unfortunately you are probably not going to find it here, but if you are looking for a bit of fun, then maybe. The thing is that the jokes really weren't all that funny, but then again, it wasn't so much the jokes, but rather the lightheartedness of the film. Yeah, I liked it, but I wouldn't be making any effort to see it again.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

21,cruise01,Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon lead this boring comedy film that is quite forgettable.,4,2 November 2018,"The Spy Who Dumped Me (2 out of 5 stars).The Spy Who Dumped Me seemed like it had good potential to be a fun action comedy film. Being like a spy comedy genre but we are left with a dud of a film that barely has any laughs or when it tries to be funny. Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon's performances are a waste. They are good actresses and I am sure they can be funny. Except, the script and direction waste their talents and left us a movie that tries for laughs but fails to even be funny.The plot was a complete boredom. Audrey (Mila Kunis) gets dumped by her boyfriend who is a spy and works for the government. When he does show up, he tells her to take a trophy which contains a flash drive to Vienna. Audrey and her best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon) take the trip to Vienna to go drop the flash drive to a person known as Verne. From there, they have another agent Sebastian (Sam Heughan) that is after them. Not sure, who they can trust besides each other.There is not much of a story. Besides, Audrey and Morgan running around international countries with a flash drive. And the bad guys are after it. Other agencies are after it. And the only thing you apparently need to know about the drive is it contains dangerous information. That can harm millions. Sure, there are a couple of twists and turns which can be predictable. Good people are bad. Or bad people are good type of scenario.It does have a lot of action. But is it memorable or exciting. Not really. Audrey and Morgan cracking jokes at each other during car chases or trying to break away from being tied up. The jokes and humor are dull and boring.Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon are great. But their talent is wasted on tedious roles with a boring script that does not give them anything new to work with. Sam Heughan playing an agent that seems shady to the girls was also fun. Justin Theroux playing a shady ex boyfriend to Audrey was also a wasted talent. Lets not forget Gillian Anderson playing Sebastian's boss which also felt like a boring character.Overall, The Spy Who Dumped Me is a bad action comedy film. The talented actresses are a waste. A lot of repetitive action that is forgettable. And a direction and script that tries for laughs that are not even funny or exciting.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
22,eddie_baggins,A forgettable comedy experience,4,12 August 2018,"From the film's opening moments, you very quickly learn to understand just what type of film The Spy Who Dumped Me will be.A comedy freshly minted from Hollywood's keenness to showcase that if men can do it, females can to, how much you will enjoy Susanna Fogel's overly violent and long in the tooth comedy escapade will depend almost entirely on how much you enjoy the interplay between its two stars Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon as best friends turned international spy's and a story that feels like it's been done a million times before.Too be fair to all involved, Kunis and McKinnon are the films greatest asset with their respective commitment to the cause evidenced by their performances, while their chemistry seems quite strong, but no matter how good these two sassy and quirky leads are, they were never going to save this often unpleasant and in many ways dull comedy from working.There's a sense that Dumped had the opportunity to really ramp up the out of their depth buddy comedy elements within its tale, from Kunis and McKinnon all of a sudden murdering their way through Europe or finding inventive ways to hide sensitive information, there's ample opportunity for Fogel and her cast to bring home the belly laughs through awkward and highly unlikely scenarios but Dumped is one of those poorly executed comedies that can't turn slight chuckles into full blown uncontrollable fits of laughter.With the laughs trickling in without every flowing freely, Dumped in-turn tends to rely more on its narrative to drive it home but the actual tale of a sought after USB being chased down by a collection of good and bad guys is highly uninteresting, while the underdeveloped relationship between Kunis's Audrey and Justin Theroux's ex-boyfriend/spy that sets this story in motion is too underdeveloped to matter, meaning the only enjoyment we get from proceedings are the infrequent comedic gold moments from Kunis and McKinnon that aren't as commonplace as needed for a film of this ilk.Final Say - Not offensively bad but so mediocre and forgettable you wonder what the point is? The Spy Who Dumped Me harbors a fine lead duo that don't get enough to do in a film that is to overly violent and long for its own good, making this experience another disappointment from the struggling Hollywood comedy marketplace.2 trapeze acts out of 5",The Spy Who Dumped Me
23,TheMovieDiorama,The Spy Who Dumped Me broke up over an uninspired text instead of a hilarious conversation.,5,13 October 2019,"Already, even before placing the glistening blu-ray disc into the tray, this action comedy had an immediate obstacle to overcome. Feig's simplistically named comedy 'Spy'. In theory, minus the reasoning for the women brashly venturing out into the field, the two film's most likely follow their plots identically. Unfortunately, that is the case. However, whilst Feig's feature remains superior, there are some aspects to this comedy caper that transforms a blatant copy into a watchable, if forgettable, globetrotting mission. After being dumped by her boyfriend, a woman and her best friend find themselves endangered when they discover he's actually a spy. They must adhere to his last words and attempt to save the world before terrorists obtain what they desire most.A trophy. What does this golden statuette contain? Well, you don't need too much imagination to seek the correct answer. In fact, you don't need to use much initiative to copy down Fogel's script word for word. The plot in itself hits every familiar beat in the spy encyclopaedia. Flee the country, visit as many European nations as possible in the two hour runtime (impressively, they did seven!) and of course ""don't trust anyone"". The latter sentiment ironically revealing certain plot twists before being executed, not being assisted by 'Spy' which performed the same trickery but with more finesse. It may seem unfair to constantly keep comparing the two, however when this iteration is a clear derivation of the aforementioned comedy, it's a fair critique to utilise.The chemistry between Kunis and McKinnon was infectious. When they contagiously laugh, you chuckle with them. When they're discussing personal issues, you feel both informed and vital to the conversation. A comedy like this wouldn't work without its lead stars, and they fortunately provided functioning chemistry. Whilst on the subject of comedy, this flick unfortunately is rarely funny. The only laughs are exerted due to McKinnon's comedic ingenuity. Yet she's too constrained by the script to actually unleash her full hilarity, seemingly a waste of her brilliant talent. Kunis was Kunis. Nothing more to say on that. And Theroux was charming if somewhat underused.Where the comedy falters however, the impeccably captured action prevails and astonished me with its precise editing. The introductory Lithuania escape had a plethora of fist fights, stunt work and realistic explosions to really set the tone for its action. The proceeding cafe brawl, urban car chase and circus act only cemented the talented choreography. Cheap visual effects were kept to a minimum and almost replicated the extravagance of a 'John Wick' picture. Never thought I'd say that, but there we are.The conclusion was underwhelming to say the least but, as I said before, it's a watchable yet forgettable spy comedy. There are countless other films that vastly succeed in balancing the comedy with the story and action, Fogel's feature just isn't quite up there. A lazy imitation of 'Spy' that is unable to be anything but a meaningless comparison. At least it provided me with a checklist of European cities I need to visit...",The Spy Who Dumped Me
24,imseeg,NOT funny.,3,16 April 2019,"Spy/gangster comedy. That is what it is called, a comedy, but it isnt funny. Not really anyway. Has got the look and feel of a television production. Mila Kunis is allright, but all the other supporting actors are mediocre at best. And the story is one big mess, lasting a whopping 2 hours. I got bored after half an hour already, because there are a trillion flashbacks that kept going back and forth in the story, back and forth, back and forth.

The movie is amusing, but what makes it awesome is the large amount of action that is in the flick. I was not expecting this level of violence. I'm sure the filmmakers thought the violence would be funny, but it did not come across that way. It's almost like True Lies or something. Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon make a wonderful team. They are extremely entertaining together. Reminds me a lot of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys: Two people better known for making us laugh are put in an action movie.In fact I'm sure that's what happen and I like it a lot.

The villains are played very well, very real, like in a Mission Impossible film. Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon have great chemistry, you really buy there friendship. The comedy is not that funny, cause it feels forced in there, can't help but feel that it was improvised for the most part.

This is an action/comedy where the action is really good and the comedy is really funny. Mila and Kate play best friends, hanging out together and playing video games when they are not working. Mila has just got a break-up text from her boyfriend, Justin. What she doesn't know is that Justin is a spy. All kinds of people are trying to kill him and the movie opens with him doing his best Bond impression of shooting, fighting and being chased. The action scenes are as good as can be expected in a regular spy movie. The chase scenes, fight scenes, as well as the gun battle scenes, are all up to snuff. As far as the comedy goes, Kate has the best lines. Sam shows up, saying he is with MI6 and trying to help Justin come in. Of course, it gets to the point where Mila and Kate get mixed up in all the spy stuff and then they get to where they can not trust anyone. There are lots of cameos: I remember seeing Jane Curtin, Paul Reiser and Gillian Anderson, among others. There are some scenes as the end credits start but nothing at the very end.

Despite big names trying to lead the fun, the increasing demand and limited supply doesn't always work out, lead to the generic tide we are seeing. Still, it's up to reviewers like me to shed some light on the topic and help inform you of the movies you are thinking of seeing. Tonight, we dive right into the action-comedy thriller, that hopes to get the month of August in a comedic light. Robbie K here reviewing:Movie: The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018)Director:
 Susanna Fogel
Writers:
 Susanna Fogel, David Iserson
Stars:
 Justin Theroux, Blanka Györfi-Tóth, Vilma Szécsi
LIKES: Good Pace: A comedy that doesn't take long to dive into all the fun, and keeps that fun going. The Spy Who Dumped Me has very few scenes that involve our characters doing nothing, leading to a well-paced movie that keeps you immersed in all the shenanigans at hand. Surprisingly Action Packed: The movie may just seem like a giant farce of spy thrillers. While this is true, the movie still managed to have some impressively choreographed battles, loaded with special effects, movie magic, and that rage bending destruction that we action junkies love. Kudos to the team responsible for thinking up the stunts, for they kept it diverse and relevant to the story and not just some ploy to rope in more bucks. The Chemistry: Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon have a fantastic chemistry together, able to form a friendship and really play off the obsession each has for the other. Their energy is infective, bouncing off of each other's quirks to continue stoking the comedic flames higher with each passing second. Yet, below the funny surface is a deeper relationship that helps fuel the adventure and intensity even more. In regards to all the secondary players in this interesting game of chess, each having an outstanding integration with our lovely ladies. Funny: The movie absolutely had me busting a gut a few times, the writers playing to my strengths of good timing and the actors bring fantastic delivery to the lines. The Spy Who Dumped Me has much diversity in their comedic presentation, ranging from witty remarks and humorous responses to the crudest jokes that are about your favorite body part on both sexes. Nevertheless, this diverse presentation and lovely ladies leading the ridiculous run, really accomplished the funny aspect of the movie. DISLIKES: The Predictability: The movie really needed to try and surprise me a little better when it came to twists and tricks. While the linearity is appreciated from the comedic stand point, it did take away from the story when you could predict so much from a mile away. Too much foreshadowing and not enough planning leads to some jokes getting ruined due to how obvious the next step was. Some Plot Elements/Character Integration: Many of the characters got their just time on the silver screen, proving their purpose for being including in the adventure at hand. Yet, there are a few plot points that were boring, or full of holes that didn't quite impress me. Much of this has to do with the random characters introduced haphazardly about midway through the movie, not really needed and not as fleshed out as they had probably planned. I know it's not supposed to make sense, I get it, it's a comedy. Yet the story element is still important and in need of tweaking for the next installment should they continue on with the series. The Crude vs Ridiculousness: The movie's comedic ploys were very reliant on the two starlets, hoping that nothing would go stale in their delivery. Some of the crude moments are not tasteful, a little insulative that crosses some lines in my book (including seeing a male genetalia). Other times the running jokes were only okay, but grew stale at times when you figured they would learn once the information was fed to them. In regards to how ridiculous this can be? It gets about a 500 on my meter, with McKinnon being the source of whimsical, serious, Mad Hatter attitude, the level of weird and over the top is raised in this film. Get ready for a lot of random lines and pick them up with caution depending on the jokes that come your way. Violence too Much?: Spy who dumped me is not anyone's friend, and the spies playing in the game sometimes go insane with gore laden moves that are slightly sickening to watch. Be prepared for very graphic kills and sickening sounds to come your way, and exercise caution prior to taking younger audience members to see it with you. THE VERDICT: The Spy who dumped me surprised me to be quite honest. My friend Rashad was right that the film is incredibly entertaining, and the leading ladies bring much of that success alongside talented dialogue writers. Even more so, the genius move of bringing action scenes to the movie was also a giant plus for me, as it kept me engaged in all the madness coming. Still, the movie has some balancing to do, primarily in trying to make an engaging storyline even though they have been shared with the rest of the group. Yet, really make sure to exercise caution with your friends/families with younger kids, for their impressionable minds may pick up a habit/nightmare you don't want. My scores are:Action/Comedy: 8.5

34,richard-1787,Weak,3,22 August 2018,"I suppose this movie will get some points because it is directed by a woman and is presented as a feminist send-up of an action movie.

The former is a sales clerk (as well as being an Art School and Law School dropout), while the latter works as a pretender in television commercials. THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME assumes that both of these chicks are numbered among the two-thirds of U.S. Citizens who are NOT packing guns (a character defect particularly prevalent on Our West Coast). Audrey is said to be a good shot from her experience with first-person shooter video games, but any Real Life gun owner will tell you that's NOT the same thing as firing live ammo. (Every time a Game Boy decides to go off his meds, buy a firearm, and go on a shooting spree, his final tally always falls woefully short of the average toll racked up by your trained U.S. Marines and Army Rangers veterans.) Audrey and Morgan suffer through demeaning torture inflicted upon them by Balkan State assassins wielding razors and rhythmic gymnastic ribbons. This poorly-armed pair jeopardize world security as they try to fight the baddies with an inferior arsenal including pocket knives and trapezes (!). Therefore, THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME is an entertaining cautionary tale about the dangers of NOT being reasonably armed.

It is generally quite silly and benign but has some really fast paced, high octane action sequences (expect the odd burning and neck-snapping).I wouldn't say this is hilarious but it is definitely entertaining.
It does a good job of mixing moments of quite inspired wit with some other more puerile stuff and the banter between the two leads is quite snappy, as is the exchanges between the actual spies.The acting is great, as are the effects, production and camera work.Story-wise it felt about fifteen minutes too long but that is not bad for an action comedy (where normally I'm reaching for my phone half an hour before the end).Although this has action in it, this is a firstly a comedy, so don't expect the plot to be too grounded in reality - they are not remaking Bourne here.To be honest I was put off by the amount of one-star reviews on IMDB; I assumed this was going to be a two hour beating with the feminist bat.
It honestly isn't.
There are some man-jokes in there but they are well balanced, in good nature, and funny.
I found the main characters easy to engage with and I was rooting for them at the end.Don't be put off just by all the low reviews, its not the best movie ever, and won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I honestly don't think it deserves as many one stars as it has.At worst this is a solid action movie with a bit of girl-talk.At best this is a light comedy with great characters, lots of actions, and a sprinkling of romance.

I knew that this action.comedy came and went pretty quickly this past summer, so I wondered what was wrong with it. But with 2 strong leads in Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon, we decided to give it a try.And we're glad we did, for THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME is a very fun, very funny action/comedy that delivers the goods with 2 charismatic and very watchable lead actresses.Kunis stars as Audrey, a waitress who's boyfriend dumps her. Unbeknownst to her, her boyfriend was...any guesses...a spy! And in his things in Audrey's apartment is an item that other spies want to get. Audrey must go on the run with her roommate and best friend, Morgan to escape the ""bad guys"" and figure out what to do to stay alive while keeping the item safe.Pretty standard plot set-up, to be sure. But in the hands of 2 comics like Kunis and McKinnon, it rises above average fair. Kunis is winning in her role and is pleasant enough personality to spend 2 hours with. McKinnon, on the other hand, is hilarious. Now, some say that ""a little Kate McKinnon goes a long way"". I don't agree with that. I find her fascinatingly funny to watch. Ranking right up there with Will Ferrell as a comedian who will go anywhere and do anything for a joke. Joining in on the fun are Jane Curtin and Paul Reiser as the parents of one of the characters. They are a welcome addition to the proceedings.Writer and Director Susanna Fogel does a nice job of keeping the plot moving and mixes fun action/chase scenes in between the comedy sequences in a formula that works very well, indeed.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed THE SPY WHO DUMPED - and you (and your house guests) will, too.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Spy Who Dumped Me

45,spookyrat1,"""Hey there. It's over. Sorry""!",7,18 August 2020,"Like quite a few others writing reviews on this site, I approached The Spy Who Dumped Me with what could only be described as, not an over abundance of enthusiasm and undoubtedly a preparedness to be disappointed with another derivative spy spoof. Instead it sucked me in, from the unexpected outset; a quite exciting, suspenseful prologue that one might have expected to find in a 007/MI outing. From there when the action shifted stateside and to besties, Audrey and Morgan, I began to laugh and frankly didn't stop laughing. I admit to not quite comprehending how such a large percentage of critics have alleged this is not a funny movie. It really is.Quite clearly it is hugely derivative. In many ways it draws on aspects of the earlier Melissa McCarthy vehicle Spy, which I also found entertaining. Like the Kingsman series, it manages to incorporate genuinely riveting action sequences into comic scenarios. And somehow director Susanna Fogel directs an enterprise in which the audience is not unperturbed as seemingly, sympathetically attractive and humorous figures frequently meet untimely and messy demises.The relationship between leads Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon is key to the success of the film and they both work terrifically well together, with chemistry that is palpable. Difficult not to believe, as they allege to more than one would be assassin, that they have known each other all their lives. I confess to knowing little about McKinnon before seeing this movie, but just have to add, she is quite hilarious and is wonderful as ""dumpee"" Audrey's faithful and trusted sidekick. Not to be missed are her 2 - way conversations with MI6 boss Wendy, a magnificently droll, but welcome appearance from Gillian Anderson. A shout out too, to Scot Sam Heughan, who does the perfect impersonation of a very English secret agent drawn into the women's increasingly dangerous adventures, beginning in America and continuing on, into very scenic European locations.Think of the The Spy Who Dumped Me, as a gender - bending cousin of the The Hitman's Bodyguard. If you found the Reynolds/Jackson combination entertaining in that affair, guaranteed you'll not be disappointed with the even more off the wall antics and repartee of Kunis and McKinnon.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
46,PsychoBeard666,Better than I expected based on the trailer,7,15 June 2019,"Mila Kunis is brilliant in this. Kate McKinnon is slightly too flamboyant but for the most part funny. The action and fight scenes in this are actually excellent, but the plot does become a tad convoluted at the midway point. Some of the jokes don't land as intended and seem improvised but made the cut for some reason.In a film with strong female leads, I found it unnecessary for Kate McKinnon's character to keep referencing that women can be tough too.

It's a movie which, judging by its title, is supposed to be a laugh as it clearly doesn't take itself seriously. Thus, you'd expect it to have an average story with some average characters which one way or another, will make you laugh multiple times, or at least keep you entertained. Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, almost none of the above are met. It has a boring plot, which although seems to start in the right way, is rapidly falls into ridiculous and forgettable, throwing most interest out the window. It's also predictable, linear and although presents a twist towards the end, it fails to deliver something good. The characters portrayed are simply idiotic, especially the blonde friend which does everything in her power to prove her ""intelligence"" quickly becoming unpleasant and even easy to hate. And as they bring no sympathy, their actions bring little entertainment or even interest.It tries to add some suspense through some intense action scenes but as they are extremely exaggerated and having the same characters in focus, they sort of miss their target. To make matters even worse than they already are, the comical part which is supposed to be the core of such a movie, also proves to be a huge let-down. It simply fails to make the viewer laugh, at least it failed miserably with me. I laughed only twice in the whole movie, while those times being due to character stupidity and not from some ingenious idea or a very good joke, pun or something.It's a movie which from my point of view, misses to do what it tried to do. I can accept a mediocre story or some not very well described characters in such a movie, as far as it manages to be entertaining or even funny.

To enjoy this film, whenever the blonde female is on screen close your eyes and shield your ears, yes this will make it impossible to watch what remains but if you can manage to do so then you may actually enjoy (at least) parts of this unfunny effort.

49,springfieldrental,Next James Bond--Actor Sam Heughan,5,8 August 2018,"First off, after viewing ""Spy,"" the next James Bond after Daniel Craig says he'll star in his final Bond film, should be, hands down, Sam Heughan. The Scottish actor is a dead ringer for a close relative of Roger Moore and his performance in this thriller provides a great audition for the role.As far as Spy goes, relative newcomer Susanna Fogel teams up with SNL alum David Iserson to write the screenplay for this spy thriller/comedy. As noted in the very-informative book on the top film directors who shaped the movies we see today, ""The 15 Geniuses Behind The Lens,"" every noted director in the book, with the exception of John Ford, had an active involvement in the scriptwriting process of their films. At least director Fogel has that going for her. She's quite competent in establishing her frames and allowing the action to flow. Her editing continuity is somewhat suspect, but all in all she's good in setting up her scenes.The only problem, as professional critics have pointed out, the film is awkward in that it doesn't really know what type of movie it wants to be. Many of the scenes are quite graphically violent, the humor can be raunch bathroom/gutter, and the actors' lines aren't comedic enough to overcome the blood and gore splattering about. Lead actress Milas Kunis is absolutely perfect for her role as one-half of the female tandem, but Kate McKinnon wears thin towards the end with her over-the-top dramatics. Spy is a bold attempt to redefine the comedy/action genre, but the two elements in this case fail to merge successfully to deliver a completely satisfying motion picture.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

It tries too hard to look funny or make you laugh in certain moments but the lack of capable one liners and poorly crafted writing made those efforts fail a big time! The Action sequences were nicely choreographed and Kate Mckinnon's Performance though a bit over the top sometimes, shines nonetheless! She made this film watchable to a certain extent! And What About Mila You ask? Well there are not much to say, she has done just an Okay Job! Can't call it bad or good either.
The main weak point of the story should be the Script and lack of interesting characters! Everyone looked so bland! And it has some serious pacing issues! One time it's fast and few moments after real slow with some unnecessary long stretched scenes and weak edits. You can surely skip it and look for a better movie to watch!

53,TheTruthofItIs,Poor attempt at a Mila & Kate buddy film,3,25 October 2018,"What is this, another Saturday Night Live production?! Half the cast are washouts from there. I think this was supposed to be Mila Kunis' biggest feature, she has top billing in it, but sorry, due to the on-all-the-time ""Family Guy"" show, I can only see her as the voice of ""Meg"" and even here you want to say ""Shut up, Meg."" This effort is tough to rate. It's got great production values but Meg, I mean Mila, and Kate are just junior varsity in this, they don't have the chops, the gravitas to play in the big leagues. And the film is conflicted in what it wants to be and that falls on junior director/writer Susanna Fogel. At times it's a comedy/parody - mostly when Kate is active, and at others it tries to be a spy drama, featuring a serious Mila. But she's out of her element, she wants to be a ""big girl"" ala Angelina Jolie or Famke Janssen but she's just too small and cute, like Sarah Hyland, ha, they could be sisters/cousins. She's a romcom queen, not an action star, and that just poisons the experience. And it doesn't help that she runs around in soccer mom attire for 90% of the run time.

55,Beejerman,JEER - (2 stars out of 10),2,13 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...A spoof on just about every and any spy movie ever made, this over-the-top action comedy stars Mila Kunis as Audrey, the unwitting ex-girlfriend of a C.I.A. spy. She comes into possession of a flash drive containing a secret so big that it could cost lives if she doesn't get it to the right people in time. With little to go on, she and her friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon), soon find themselves overseas being chased by numerous gunmen. The bullets are flying, the body count is adding up, and nobody can be trusted.Sounds good, right? I wish. What a major disappointment. The action sequences are WAY over-the-top, very violent and bloody enough to rival Full Metal Jacket. At least in Full Metal Jacket, those scenes were well made. In this film, the editing was terrible - cut from a character talking, to the back side of their head (which is clearly no longer moving in rhythm with their speech), and then back to their face which is not in the position it was before. This type of editing happens often throughout this movie.It seemed that Mila Kunis got stuck on saying the same thing over and over again in various situations ... ""Oh, my God!"" Every time anything bad ever happens to her it's, ""Oh, my God!"" It got to be so bad, I was rolling my eyes and began saying it with her even though I'd never seen this movie before. ""Oh, my God!"" And the flash drive that people were dying over? It contained a back door to the ... (wait for it) ... the Internet. Wait, what? The Internet? LOL. Stupid. Then when the final pieces are finally placed together at the end of the movie, none of it makes sense.There were a few instances where I genuinely laughed, but overall this isn't a funny movie. I would put this on the same level as something like the Mike Myers film, ""Love Guru"", but more polished. This is ultimately just a sad mess.

We don't believe it, Audrey doesn't believe it, no one believes it, because she is suppose to be the Chris Farley to Mila's David Spade. You know what they had writer/director Susanna Fogel...heart. In that, though Farley was a buffoon, at the core he was truly a person you wanted to hang out with and would pick you up if you were down. McKinnon is vamping for camera. She's really annoying.
The story is also pretty dumb and unreal. Typical of a ""let's rip a dude story off and empower women."" Wrong! You were suppose to write a woman spy movie and not steal the poor tropes of spy-dom.

69,akcenat,Buddy action romp that overdoes it on the feminism thing,5,21 October 2018,"The plot of this film isn't inventive or original.

Drew dumps Audrey, then un-dumps her (because he was really just a spy who wanted to protect her) and then promptly dies, all in the opening ten minutes. Our duo must deliver the only possession of his they didn't burn (after the initial dumping), a second-place fantasy football trophy, to person called Verne in Vienna, Austria. With an out-of-the-world plot, this movie is funnier and more action pack than the trailer would allow you to believe. Much of the humor is situational and two lead actors have very good rapport with each other. The locations are good, showcasing Europe quite nicely, and not your typical hot spots either. Also, it comes with a decent soundtrack too, but on the other side the 117-minute film could have afforded to lose at least 20 minutes.

73,Magow-Intermean,The Spy Who Dumped Me Review,9,22 March 2019,"Audrey (Mila Kunis) has just been dumped. She thinks her ex, Drew (Justin Theroux), got bored with her, but he is, in fact, a spy. When he resurfaces and reveals assassins are after him, Audrey has to complete his mission with the dubious help of her best friend, Morgan (Kate McKinnon). At several points in this uneven, but always likeable, comedy, Kate McKinnon's character, Morgan, is described as, ""a little much"". It's never an accusation that can be levelled at McKinnon as an actress. She is usually, honestly, not quite enough; consistently underused in movies that would greatly benefit from a dash more McKinnon. And while she's technically the support as the catalyst for the adventure centres around Mila Kunis' Audrey, they soon become a delightful double act. Indeed, one of the great pluses of The Spy Who Dumped Me is that it gives McKinnon a very-nearly-lead role and she does not squander it. Audrey is a woman who rarely makes a fuss. Her boyfriend, Drew (Theroux), has just dumped her and she's moping about it, complaining to Morgan, her best friend, and trying to keep others from finding out her life is now empty. But her wish for an existence that's a little more exciting suddenly comes true - she discovers her ex is actually a spy, assassins are after him, and it's going to fall to her to complete his secret mission. In the great tradition of accidental spy movies, Audrey goes haring around Europe, getting repeatedly involved in shoot-outs, car chases and double-crosses, with Morgan in constant tow. Writer-director Susanna Fogel, whose only other feature credit is 2014's indie Life Partners, puts together some very solid action scenes - the opening, in which we learn Drew's real job, is particularly strong, with some very well-choreographed sequences that mix Bond and Bourne with big laughs. Stronger, though, are the lower-key scenes with Audrey and Morgan. Kunis and McKinnon are very different performers, but Fogel finds a rhythm to suit them both. Kunis dials up, and McKinnon dials a little down. Audrey starts as the more wired of the two, quite rightly freaked out by what's happening, while Morgan leans into it. Gradually the two start to switch places, until Audrey's the cool badass who can outwit any bad guy and Morgan has gone full lunatic, battling a grinning assassin on a trapeze. It's unlikely, though, that anyone will be coming to this looking for a sophisticated spy mystery, so plot messiness can be, to an extent, forgiven. As a comedy it's frequently great amounts of fun, and you absolutely won't come away feeling like you were left shortchanged on McKinnon.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

75,Donatien3,An Entertaining Spy-Comedy,9,8 June 2020,"The spy-comedy sub-genre, where a comically mismatched person gets thrust into the international spy world, has been done many times, but ""The Spy who Dumped Me"" rides the usual clichés (including the James Bond/Austin Powers-inspired title) and ends up being quite entertaining.When Audrey (Mila Kunis) discovers her ex-boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux) is a spy, she and her best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon) are embroiled in a global spy mission involving a flash drive containing mysterious terrorist secrets.While the romantic sub-plot between Audrey and fellow spy Sebastian (Sam Heughan) plays out predictably, the chemistry between Kunis and McKinnon really makes this movie. McKinnon is hilarious and dominates the film (her vibrant personality bursts off the screen), while Kunis seems happy to play the straight woman and kick some butt in the process. We're also spared the best-friends-fight-then-reunite-before-the-end cliche, with Audrey and Morgan staying and working together.The best part of the movie is a death-defying circus fight scene between Morgan and a deadly gymnast assassin.The movie gets a bit ridiculous towards the end, with a few red herrings throw in; it's a trait usually reserved for more conventional spy movies, but everything works out in the end.It's also surprisingly violent for a comedy (including a gross thumb-cutting scene), along with a lot of dirty jokes (Audrey hides the flash drive in a 'special' part of her body), and a bit of full frontal male nudity, but it adds to the appeal.""...Dumped Me"" is better than the usual glut of seen-it-all-before spy-comedies, driven by the chemistry between Kunis and McKinnon.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

The twists and double crosses come at such a fast rate people are interchangeable: bad and good. Leaving the ""comedy"" to the girl from SNL was a big mistake. She isn't a ""make this boring script funny"" person. She is good at impressions and does what the dozen writers on that show tell her to do. Not one to improvise humor.

So this movie is a winning combination for me, and a winning combination it is. I liked the movie. It's definitely not a masterpiece, I can't remember a spy comedy that was. Maybe the original Avengers series of the 60s. But Mila's unique ability to create a likeable character that feels real, no matter what circumstances you put her in works here just Like it did in Jupiter Ascending and in Bad Moms where she was the only redeeming quality of the movie (with Christina Applegate). It's a very important quality for an actress (or an actor), think about it, she was likeable even in That 70s Show, where she played a jerk of a sort. And she does feel real, one does believe her she's smart enough to think fast on her feet even when scared silly by the crazy things going around her.Countering her is Kate McKinnon, who does again the silly (but not always silly) and over the top shtick, she's almost a carbon copy of her role in Ghost Busters. Jane Curtin and Paul Reiser are always a nice surprise in a movie and they're as good as you'd expect them to be, and so is Gillian Anderson. Ivanna Sakhno is the real surprise of the movie as the cold blooded assassin, giving a very nuanced performance in a role where less would've been expected.Altogether, this is a well done cute spy comedy that left me with a wide smile, and I wish I could leave more movies like this.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Perhaps this movie would find its audience somewhere but unfortunately for me, the comedy didn't work and the 'mystery/spy' aspect didn't work.The Spy Who Dumped Me reminds me of 2015's 'Spy' starring Melissa McCarthy in that they feature over the top comedy under the lens of spies doing ridiculous things.

That the best thing I could say about this attempted buddy-spy-spoof that is all shouting, cliche and non-stop movement. Someone needs to tell the filmmakers that when you present a line, sight gag or incongruity that is supposed to elicit laughter or any kind of reaction from the audience, you must give it at least five seconds to register. You don't get a nanosecond here. Thus potentially funny lines by the leads, assassins, an abducted cab driver, etc., are scattered by a hurricane withut being seen or heard. The main characters try hard to be pitiable and part of this may well be a generation gap thing. I can pity main characters who are themselves caricatures of nasty, selfish people who are supposed to be our heroes. Kunis shouts all the time while being frenetic and clueless.. No balance here as McKinnon's character is a know-it-all who makes no sense whatsoever. The violence is of the bang-bang variety, nothing gruesome thank goodness but continually tedious.After an hour, I asked myself why am I still watching this. I said well I wanted to see it and got the disk from the library so let's see it to the end. That said, I did put away some laundry during the rest of the movie which seemed to make it a bit less stultifying. The characters played video games in the beginning and it made me want to go out and play one myself, something I haven't done since Tomb Raider was new and before the first Tomb Raider movie came out.Like I said, I'm in my sixties and from what I've observed in stand-up and TV, this nastiness, sarcasm, exaggeration thing seems to pass for humor these days so perhaps the generation it's made for may find it funny.

Audrey later flirt with a man by the name of Sebastian, who unexpectedly throws her into his car and reveals to her that Drew is actually a secret agent. She informs Morgan, and Drew suddenly returns home to instruct them to deliver an important trophy.I wasn't super familiar with Kate McKinnon before this, but she got a lot of the best lines. Her character's tendency for saying whatever's on her mind, no matter how weird or badly timed it may be, makes the jokes more unpredictable, and you laugh at her ballsy nature and impulsiveness. And you've got to love her go at a British accent.Mila Kunis gives one of her best performances in a while, really managing to live into the wacky situations she gets thrown into. Not to mention she has some pretty funny moments herself. The few quieter moments where she and McKinnon just reflect on their lives are nice to see, and helps you emotionally connect to them. Justin Theroux and not-Chris-Pratt Sam Heughan also give really good performances as agents Drew and Sebastian. I won't spoil too much, but the movie takes some pretty interesting turns with their characters.Not just the comedy works, it's also surprisingly well-filmed, with intense and very brutal action sequences. You feel the bullets and the impact of the action. It's less Mission: Impossible and more Kingsman: The Secret Service in terms of the violence.If you're coming to this movie for Gillian Anderson (that was part of the reason I checked it out), she gives a restrained, fairly comic performance as the spy organization boss Wendy. The highlight is when she gets to yell at her two incompetent lackeys. However, this is where I get to one of my criticisms. I wish she would have gotten more to do. In total her screentime equals to a few minutes at the most, and that's not enough. I would have loved to see her play a bigger role, instead she always gets pushed to the side. Then there are also a couple jokes that didn't do it for me, but given the amount of humor in the script, you can't hit the target every time. Plus they are so few and far between that you forget about them quickly.We don't have enough R-rated comedies nowadays that's not exclusively about partying. This is a light feel-good ride with some darkly comic elements.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
87,ccunning-73587,Just a really bad-d-d movie!,1,5 June 2019,"Just a really bad-d-d movie! Nothing redeeming or enjoyable. A lot of unrealistic action scenes strung together so you might believe it was 'fast paced'. Terrible acting! The female leads were 10 times worse than any of the girls in the old 'Charlie's Angles' leads and the male actors were only a smidgen better but definitely weak. Some scenes were funny only because they were so terrible. It was mostly just a crude, vulgar movie with vulgarity dominant in almost every scene: The only nudity was two full screen shots of a man's penis & testicles from the front and the back; where she hid the flash drive; Profanity, mostly F-bombs everywhere; etc. The two female leads play ditsy females, which are their off screen personality in real life if you see some of their interviews, as if they were brain dead stoners... Maybe a 'chick flick', maybe not, but definitely a strong female influence in writing and producing as it is mostly emotion based and not reality based. Don't waste your time on this one...",The Spy Who Dumped Me

You have seen this story before a zillion times but, the thing here is they added, well how shall I say it... a third wheel. Kate McKinnon's Morgan. This character is amusing but forces the story into something that makes little sense.. a splitting of the main character into her funny and somber parts... poor Milia Kunis gets to be the somber one. At the end we get an extended Kate Mc Kinnon ending and I just kept asking *why* why is this woman on my screen? Can we get back to the main story? You can just see some Hollywood person reading the script and deciding they needed someone like Kate McKinnon. And this movie has a rare distinction... at the end the woman is supposed to get out of her poor clothing and dress up like a babe. But there they actually make Millia Kunis look horrible. Blonde hair and a purple dress. Ugh.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

It's not the bumbling innocence of Clouseau, as quite a trail of violent deaths follows them and our two heroines do discover hidden reserves of strength and smarts along the way. Clouseau harks back to an earlier age before brutal violence went mainstream. And in that modern context this film delivers a lot of laughs.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

The script and lack of script editing let it down but it had so many good factors that lifted it up again that it deserved a good 6/10 . That's not a bad score by any means .What was good about it ? A star is born - Kate McKinnon stole the show as Morgan Freeman she's a comic genius - Sam Heugan looked like the son of Roger Moore who ironically played Bond in The spy who loved me and was perfectly cast , but really shone out was the direction and locations - Vienna , Prague , Berlin , Paris - a beautiful tour of the glorious architecture of Europe . Ivanna Sakhno deserves a mention for her acting , Mila Kunis was the star that will put the bums on seats but it's the other Ukrainian lady who has the stage presence . What let it down ? The script and script editing were far from perfect , some of the violence and gun fights were a bit too cartoon like ,Justin Theroux was poorly cast and was ten years too old for the role . It wasn't consistent throughout it had good and bad parts and would have scored 7 or 8 had it been consistent and if they make a sequel I feel it will be better - it'll be Wendy's ( Gillian Anderson ) angels Overall an enjoyable film with a few bits that ruined it - it's worth seeing with low expectations Pad.A 6/10",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Fans of action blockbusters might pass up what seems a light-hearted comedy but the action scenes are actually very good. They are funnier and also bloodier than you'll be expecting. The movie is super entertaining. We got fight scenes, car chases, undercover missions, mixed with a wonderful duo. In general the movie doesn't always hit the mark, but it entertains in both the action and comedy departments.

As Audrey's (Kunis) ex-boyfriend (Theroux) turns out to be a spy, she and her best friend Morgan Freeman (fun name I know, played by McKinnon) is dragged into a large-scale spy mission involving a terror plot.

99,bastille-852-731547,Surprisingly Good Action-Comedy,7,10 August 2018,"I will preface this review by stating that I only saw this in theaters because I had a free ticket. Even though I love spy movies, I thought the trailers for this didn't look very good and went in with low expectations. While it's not a masterpiece by any means, it's actually a very fun and entertaining action-comedy that surpassed my expectations. If you keep your expectations in check, you can have a very good time with this film.The plot centers around a woman who must go on the run with her best friend to finish a mission surrounding her boyfriend (a spy,) who recently broke up with her. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Kunis and McKinnon normally, they both had very good chemistry in the film. One of the things that I was most pleased by about this movie was how good the action scenes are. The action scenes are intense, immersive and surprisingly brutal. The film uses a mix of chase scenes, shootouts and fight scenes. While some of those elements may sound derivative (and they can be, for sure) of other action movies, the film's script incorporates unique elements to the film's characters and their role at the intersection of the film's narrative to add a sense of depth to the action. Now make no mistake, the action isn't on the level of ""Mission: Impossible--Fallout"" or ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but it's still definitely quite good. A climactic action scene on a trapeze feels wholly original and uniquely clever.""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" also has potent cinematography too, with simple but beautiful shots of key European cities as the plot moves from location to location. Such cities include Vienna, Prague, Paris, Budapest and Berlin. The film has a great score and is also generally paced well, although the second act drags a little and feels a bit more disjointed than the first and third acts, respectively. The main flaw with the film is the comedy. The film's one-liners tend to miss more than they hit, and the ones that miss range from being cheesy to just flat-out stupid. But there still are plenty of amusing and funny moments of humor. All in all, ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" was definitely better than I thought. Recommended. 7/10",The Spy Who Dumped Me

103,Fudge-3,"Funny, lots of action and violent",6,28 August 2018,"Judging from the audience this is aimed at late-teen girls. Sadly they don't seem to go to the cinema much as the film isn't getting a long release.Two sassy Americans with unfulfilled relationships get dragged into the world of Bond, Bourne and Ethan Hunt by a dastardly ex-boyfriend. They must help save the world with their blend of loud attitude and bungling ineptitude.It is funny. There is slap stick, toilet gags and lots of OMG. Some of the one-liners are great and the delivery is spot on. There are chases and escapes that rival any pure action movie. But it is also really violent and I don't think humour works when it's bracketed by violence.I'll give you an example: a character does a parp joke, gets his head blown off and then does another parp joke. This is funny if the character is a puppet and there is lots of felt stuffing flying about (especially if it then lays an egg). But is it funny if the character is supposed to be a real person? Or are you left squirming with a half-laugh and half-yuck expression on your face? In my mind the exiting head spoils the joke.Teenagers and older will enjoy this film.Add a point if you like Tarantino movies in which there is a similar, uncomfortable blend of style and violence.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
104,cappiethadog,The cashier is driving the car,7,5 December 2019,"Holding the men at bay comes with the territory. Nancy Prior(Karen Black), the chief stewardess, has heard it all, probably on a daily basis; the unwarranted comments on her looks, the propositioning, from colleagues and passengers alike. Riding the escalator with Bette(Christopher Norris), a younger stewardess, the veteran tells the rookie that she never checks her schedule, when asked about the pilots they'll be accompanying on the next flight. Both women accept that it comes with the territory. It's the early-to-mid-seventies. Beth talks about the potentiality of a ""rough crew"" with mock horror in Jack Smight's ""Airport '75"". Her blithe attitude indicates to a contemporary audience that she looks forward to being blatantly objectified. For Bette, and women just like her, young and attractive, it was flirting, the lesser of two evils, a game played between two consenting adults. Grin and bear it, that is what Nancy's silent complicity implies, as they walk towards their office, a Boeing 747. Julio(Erik Estrada), a flight engineer, gives Bette the worst time, but she never reports his bad behavior to Nancy, or the proper authorities. It wouldn't matter anyway. The chief stewardess is dating the captain.A Ukrainian male tries to pick up Morgan(Kate McKinnon) with the sort of man-on-the-make lines that may have gone over well in an airline cockpit circa 1974. Morgan wants to cheer up her best friend, the birthday girl, and also, a blue girl, after being unceremoniously dumped via text, so she cajoles Viktor(Dustin Demri-Burns) into replicating his ""aggressive masculinity"" schtick for her BFF. According to the Ukrainian pick-up artist, in Suzanne Fogel's ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"", Audrey possesses ""big baby eyes"" and ""soft supple udders"". He is no Drew Thayer(Justin Theroux), who turns out to be not only a spy, but a bad boyfriend. A gentleman hides his top secret USB drive in a rented locker at a subway station, not at home with your girlfriend, a supermarket cashier living paycheck by paycheck, where she can be gunned down in cold blood by a politically incorrect spy from the former U.S.S.R. Before Drew loses consciousness, he deputizes Audrey as his surrogate; in essence, putting her in an on-the-job training situation by default; a man's job, just like Nancy, the accidental pilot, who has no choice but to take command of Columbia Airlines Flight 105 following a midair collision with a single engine biplane which puts all the pilots out of permanent commission.""The stewardess if flying the plane?"" a passenger(Sid Caesar) asks rhetorically, as if the idea of a female hero is unfathomable. From a control tower, aviation experts instruct the absolute beginner on flying basics. ""You just hang in there, Nancy,"" the airline employee encourages. She's important now. Nobody calls her ""babe"". The stewardess ""is"" hanging in there. ""We have faith in you,"" he adds. The airline employee lies. Nobody has faith that Nancy, a woman, can do anything more than be a ""waitress in the sky"". Given the opportunity, Nancy, who displays grace under pressure all throughout the ordeal. could have landed the Boeing as well as any man. The stewardess is no pilot, but she conducts herself like a professional; she executes all the requisite one-hundred-eighty degree turns, keeps a close eye on the particulars of the control panel(e.g. the altimeter), and averts the makings of a cataclysmic airborne event by clearing the mountain range. The cockpit has an open seat. Carol lets Beth off the hook when she instructs her subordinate to check on the welfare of Flight 105's passengers. But there are other stewardesses to do that. Beth doesn't have her back. She should ignore the order and make herself co-pilot, occupying the seat of a dead man who treated her like a juicy steak. Together, they could have called off the cockamamie plan of lowering an Air Force pilot, and then Captain Murdock(Charlton Heston) himself, into the gaping hole of a lightning-fast-moving jumbo jet.Audrey and Morgan, de facto spies on a crash course in espionage, reach their rendezvous point, an upscale Austrian restaurant in Venice. Sebastian Henshaw(Sam Heughhan) a MI6 agent, identifies himself as ""Vern"", the man that Audrey's CIA boyfriend told her she could entrust the flash drive with. Sebastian is not Vern, which is a good thing, because the real Vern, a female bathroom attendant, is in cahoots with a rival spy agency, as well as Drew, the spy who double-crossed she. At that moment, Morgan can't distinguish friend from foe. Since it's 2019, not 1974, Morgan puts her own life on the line, yelling across a crowded room lousy with covert assassins: ""That's not Vern!"" which triggers a deadly free-for-all. Morgan is Audrey's co-pilot; she runs toward, not away from her partner-in-crime.The American women need a getaway car. Audrey just shot a guy. The cashier is high on adrenaline. They carjack an elderly couple. Riffing on the helpless female trope, neither Audrey nor Morgan knows how to handle stick. They need a man. Nearby, the spies-in-training locate one, a Bitteauto driver. Followed by three black-cladded men on motorcycles in hot pursuit, Lukas(Kev Adams), a recreational meth user, outpaces them, until the lead cyclist pulls alongside the tiny European automobile, and shoots their male savior in the side of his head. No one is driving the car. That's when Audrey has her Karen Black moment. She sits in the dead man's lap and takes command of the steering wheel, deftly nudging one of her pursuers against a car parked parallel. Audrey doesn't need some man sitting shotgun; she has Morgan, her best friend, to do spy stuff with.Captain Murdoch lands the plane. Carol, his girlfriend, is eternally grateful. If she minds that her heroism gets eclipsed by his, we'll never know. Where is the drama in Charlton Heston saving the day?Sisters are doing it for themselves, in ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"". Audrey slams down the emergency break, which dislodges their attacker off from the roof of the car and onto the pavement. A woman did that.Drew was half-right when he told Audrey not to trust anybody. She graduates from spy school during the penultimate scene, when she lifts the gun that this double agent was going to shoot her with, from his back pocket while they're in a clinch.""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" continues the new traditionalism of Noah Baumbach's influential ""Frances Ha"", which posits the idea of platonic between best friends as being an everlasting love, a true love, more true than romantic love, but this time in a genre film.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

In the new film ""The Spy Who Dumped Me""; audiences are introduced to Audrey (Mila Kunis), and her friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon). Audrey is in a funk as she was dumped by text by her boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux) and spends her Birthday wallowing in pity and doubt about her life. Morgan is ever optimistic and energetic encourages her to burn the items Drew left behind as a form of starting over.Empowered by the idea; Audrey texts her intentions to Drew who has ignored repeated contact attempts from Audrey so she can get closure. Unknown to either Audrey or Morgan is the fact that Drew is actually a Spy and is currently being hunted by some very dangerous people overseas.Audrey and Morgan meet a man named Sebastian (Sam Heughan) who claims to know the situation with Drew and offers to help the girls with a situation they are now entangled within.When Drew shows up unexpectedly to retrieve an item and ends up in a bad way, Morgan and Audrey follow his instructions and head to Vienna with a statute and find themselves on the run from spies, assassins, and all manner of dangers.The plot of the film is convoluted and there is not much in the way of character growth. But the film does have some funny moments and many of them come from the frequent riffing of McKinnon who is just a non-stop spark of energy who fires off snappy comments no matter if facing a psychotic gymnast or in a high-speed chase.Heughan is good stepping out from his Outlander character and it is nice to see him mixing in some comedy with the action scenes. Kunis and McKinnon work well with one another and seem to be having a great time working with one another on the film.Despite some issues, the film was a pleasant and fun piece of entertainment as long as you are willing to just sit back and enjoy the ride.3.5 stars out of 5",The Spy Who Dumped Me
111,margulanabutrlov,The Spy Who Dumped Me Review,10,22 March 2019,"Audrey (Mila Kunis) has just been dumped. She thinks her ex, Drew (Justin Theroux), got bored with her, but he is, in fact, a spy. When he resurfaces and reveals assassins are after him, Audrey has to complete his mission with the dubious help of her best friend, Morgan (Kate McKinnon).
At several points in this uneven, but always likeable, comedy, Kate McKinnon's character, Morgan, is described as, ""a little much"". It's never an accusation that can be levelled at McKinnon as an actress. She is usually, honestly, not quite enough; consistently underused in movies that would greatly benefit from a dash more McKinnon. And while she's technically the support as the catalyst for the adventure centres around Mila Kunis' Audrey, they soon become a delightful double act. Indeed, one of the great pluses of The Spy Who Dumped Me is that it gives McKinnon a very-nearly-lead role and she does not squander it.
Audrey is a woman who rarely makes a fuss. Her boyfriend, Drew (Theroux), has just dumped her and she's moping about it, complaining to Morgan, her best friend, and trying to keep others from finding out her life is now empty. But her wish for an existence that's a little more exciting suddenly comes true - she discovers her ex is actually a spy, assassins are after him, and it's going to fall to her to complete his secret mission.
In the great tradition of accidental spy movies, Audrey goes haring around Europe, getting repeatedly involved in shoot-outs, car chases and double-crosses, with Morgan in constant tow. Writer-director Susanna Fogel, whose only other feature credit is 2014's indie Life Partners, puts together some very solid action scenes - the opening, in which we learn Drew's real job, is particularly strong, with some very well-choreographed sequences that mix Bond and Bourne with big laughs. Stronger, though, are the lower-key scenes with Audrey and Morgan. Kunis and McKinnon are very different performers, but Fogel finds a rhythm to suit them both. Kunis dials up, and McKinnon dials a little down. Audrey starts as the more wired of the two, quite rightly freaked out by what's happening, while Morgan leans into it. Gradually the two start to switch places, until Audrey's the cool badass who can outwit any bad guy and Morgan has gone full lunatic, battling a grinning assassin on a trapeze.
It's unlikely, though, that anyone will be coming to this looking for a sophisticated spy mystery, so plot messiness can be, to an extent, forgiven. As a comedy it's frequently great amounts of fun, and you absolutely won't come away feeling like you were left shortchanged on McKinnon.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

If you expect anything different from Kate McKinnon or Mila Kunis, you really need to re-evaluate your choices in films.It's nice to see a female buddy movie with women who surprise themselves with their strength. Their close friendship is so nice rather than the usual bickering you see with female characters. They don't rely on things that movies like Bridesmaids do like crass, graphic toilet humor and very unflattering portraits of women where there's always one portrayed as the ugly friend. If you replaced these women with men it would have been a huge hit.My only negative reviews would be that Kate is sometimes allowed to go too over the top. And both look well over 30, the stated age of the characters. Sometimes the antics would be more appropriate for MUCH younger women even tho they are meant to be sort of immature and unaccomplished.Overall, I really enjoyed it and laughed until my sides hurt.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

But since Mila Kunis is so cute I stuck with it, frankly I am glad that I did, it gets better folks!The story is as cheesy as it gets, the humor is as cheesy as it gets (at times), the acting gets a little cheesy at times and the constant scene shifting gets stifling but the action is almost non stop and it works.Gillian Anderson looks better as she gets older, what on earth is that about?? I loved the way she played her character in this, please give us more Gillian in the second movie (or whatever - please!).In all, if you go or stay in to see a really high class (non-cheesy) movie this probably isn't it, but if you like a bit of a yarn that has some excellent choreography (fight action) then this is the movie for you. Although the constant James Bond type character acting can be a wee bit over the top at times.Not wishing to understate the importance of the Kate McKinnon character in this, I wonder if Kate couldn't have had just a slightly less 'weird' character? Not that it was bad, it just wasn't as possible for Kate to shine as well she would have.Synopsis: it's a comedy with some nice action scenes with Mila Kunis and Gillian Anderson in it.

Her chemistry with Kate McKinnon was also notably fun.
As for the Russian villain found in Ivanna Sakhno, wow... I couldn't decide if I found her to be attractive or frightening. Maybe a combination of both.
Either way, she was terrific.As for the guys, I've always dug Justin Theroux as a good looking decent bloke. But damn... who the hell is this Sam Heughan, with his tall handsome stature, faultless chiselled jaw, blue eyes and perfect wavy blonde hair.

136,Tron79,A fun surprise,10,23 October 2018,"(very mild spoilers)
Browsing imdb I see that many had very low ratings for this movie. I had the direct opposite reaction. I couldn't get enough of Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon.
I'm not sure how much Kate McKinnon ad-libbed her dialog and how much was actually written, but I really enjoyed her ""no filter"" banter. I haven't seen many episodes of the newer SNL, so I wasn't very familiar with McKinnon's work, but I can now say I am a fan. It didn't hurt that Mila Kunis looked absolutely amazing in this movie!! That was a bonus. I thought the writers did a good job developing Mila's character enough so that I cared what happened to her. I liked the theme that she never finished what she started in her life. She was stuck working a dead-end job as a checkout person in her Hawaiian shirt.I'm not going to over analyze this movie. Some movies are just meant to be fun entertainment. I was really surprised I liked this movie as much as I did. I rarely give a movie a 10 rating. I'm not going to get into the technical details of the ""film"" this time. I guess many don't have the same tastes as me by looking at so many other poor reviews. But for me, I will watch this one again, and I'm searching for other movies with McKinnon and Kunis.Edited:
After writing, I wanted to mention a similar movie that I enjoyed even more than this one, ""Keeping Up with the Joneses."" Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher are both great. I've re-watched it 3 times. I must like the ""normal person becomes spy"" idea. Isla and Mila should join up on a mission of their own. Zach and Kate need to get together in a scene going to a place that has both indoor skydiving and a trapeze.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
137,MichaelNontonMulu,A Hilarious Action Comedy Movie,8,3 August 2018,"Well this movie was a lot more fun that I anticipated. First I thought that the comedy would be just so so or only glimpses of them. But apparently the film was filled with so many hilarious moments. The comedic and rather absurd situations they were in and sometimes because of themselves were always fun to watch. Sometimes the fun stuff also came from the conversation they had or the comments Morgan (Kate McKinnon) made on Audrey (Mila Kunis) which was really spot on. There were so many hilarious scenes in the movie but my most favorite one was the chasing sequence in the roads of Vienna and also the library scene (which made my wife could not stop laughing). And most of the audience in our studio were really enjoying themselves as we were laughing throughout the whole movie.The film also had some unexpectedly good action sequence, particularly the fight & car chase scenes which I thought was done nicely and professionally. The movie was quite old school in the action part and did not use too much computer for their special effects. While the sound effects were pretty decent for such movie. The main attraction for this movie was definitely the 2 lead stars Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon who had good chemistry & quite convincing as two best friends. While Mila's character Audrey was what you could expect from her, but Kate I think truly excelled in her role. She looked really natural as the person who does not seem to think ahead and just go with her heart. This movie should not be compared to the serious spy movie like James Bond or the more recent one like Mission: Impossible series. I actually felt that the movie had some similarities with another very funny 2015 action comedy movie titled Spy starring Melissa McCarthy. This film may not have the most original story/plot but it certainly gave me & my wife a bunch of laughter, making us feeling very happy after leaving the theater.With a duration of almost 2 hours, the movie did not feel too long. In fact I think it's just nice as the story did not feel rushed to complete and we were given plenty of hilarious scenes with some nice action sequence. During the end credit scene, there were few funny scenes that you could enjoy but there was no such scene at all after it was complete. So if you are looking just pure fun without overthinking of the plot, then this one would do nicely. But if you are looking for some serious spy stuff or prefer the full action movie, then better find some other movies to fill your time.

Right from the beginning the scenes are jarring and hard to follow and lent more to thoughts of alright let's get this over with instead of enjoying what was happening. There is no action film that can possibly thrive with bad action scenes. Luckily for this film it had each foot in different barrels. Which really isn't a good thing, but oh well.
 ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"" played off of James Bond in a parody way that almost turned into a comedy version, but it really wasn't that funny which brought us right back to the bad action scenes. Smartly, they got Kate McKinnon involved with the film who whether the lines were scripted or not, I am positive that McKinnon provided another level of comedy that was otherwise not written or just no provided by the other actors. Mila Kunis tried her best, really taking on the more confident character, but even when she tried to be funny it fell far from what McKinnon was bringing. 
 In and out of the film, if you are a fan of McKinnon then you probably enjoyed her humor and off-the-wall self, however if you were looking for almost anything else you left disappointed. A star power duo cast with lots of potential, but a bad script and director and it fell on its face.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

The characters were weird and didn't have much depth, save for one or two moments. Ending was dumb. I kept waiting for a better twist, like making Kate McKinnon's character secretly a spy too, and show that she has been secretly helping Mila Kunis's character behind the scenes the whole time. But no, the show followed a single predictable trajectory and made it physically hurt to watch it at times (cause I kept wincing or grimacing).

And Kunis is so overly self-possessed on screen that there's no sense of real vulnerability. So together you have a kind of cold duo going through decent action movie motions.

It's not a great sign whenever you make a comedy-meets-another-genre when the other genre dominates in being more successful and the comedy isn't successful in the slightest.The Spy Who Dumped Me is an example of that.Mila Kunis has comedy pedigree I suppose for being the weaker voice in several weak comedies, and Kate McKinnon rides on being a strong voice in solid comedies and being one of the few redeeming things in the new Ghostbusters. But here, together, they...Don't quite hit the mark.Some jokes hit well, but many don't. Like said before, it's bad that these two comediennes are supposed to anchor a comedy action spy thriller (all descriptive words used lightly) but the most compelling thing about the movie is the action that's...surprisingly half competent despite not really being the main focus.It's fun and silly in that regard, but those beats only really snap you back into enjoyment when the inbetween is fairly subpar narrative that hits the beats you know it's gonna hit.Predictability is something I handwave when it comes to criticism, but I do have to say that what do you expect from this movie. It's a forgettable film that's released inbetween anything really happening at the cinema that you'll most likely skip past on Netflix the next time you see the poster.

The second thing of note is that the always funny Kate McKinnon... isn't . She tries hard, but the the role of the kooky gal pal is beyond redemption, even for her..Others in the cast do their best, and I have to admit that the action sequences are good, but this film is much too long. I also have to take issue with some of the violence. In one sequence, a taxi driver is shot to death while taking the two women someplace. This sequence bothers me because it trivializes death. Bear in mind, this is supposed to be a comedy. We expect scenes like this in an authentic spy caper, but here, the sequence is gratuitous and creepy.

I still enjoyed it despite its flaws. Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon had great chemistry and, for me, they carried the whole thing. Sam Hueghan, from Outlander, was just okay.

166,joshteggert,"'The Spy Who Dumped Me' bites off more than it can chew, ultimately failing in its mission to produce an engaging espionage rib-tickler.",3,6 August 2019,"The Spy Who Dumped Me follows the story of two best friends, Audrey (Mila Kunis) and Morgan (Kate McKinnon) who are inadvertently dragged into a chaotic international conspiracy after discovering that the former's ex-boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux) is a spy.As with most contemporary spy comedies, the stakes are set outlandishly high; their mission - though there was no option of 'choosing to accept it' - is to save the world from a mysterious threat which has already compromised Drew's cover. In doing so, the two women race around Europe, facing off assassins at every corner with the help of the attractive-yet-shady British agent, Sebastian (Sam Heughan).This is already quite a tenuous storyline, but the ultimate narrative adds twists that are strangely predictable yet never explained. Director and co-writer Susanna Fogel creates an absurd plot from the outset and attempts to portray it as having the potential to pose a serious threat. She then tries to balance this with continuous light-hearted comedy (as well as some powerful feminist themes) but nothing ever quite clicks.The outcome is a confusing tone that manages to only partially fulfil its many ambitions. What's more, the humour here is passable at best. Kunis and McKinnon are the real driving force behind the film, and they use their chemistry to elevate poor gags to a tolerable standard. The greatest chuckles admittedly come when Saturday Night Live star McKinnon uses her improvisational skills to provide some killer one-liners alongside an otherwise mediocre script. Both Kunis and McKinnon succeed in making their friendship extremely convincing, as if they've been friends for years; their charisma manages to make some unbelievable circumstances significantly more personal, possibly the greatest achievement of the feature.Yet sadly, it does not compensate for the absent magnetism in Kunis and Theroux's on-screen relationship, on which the entire premise of the film is built. It is unfortunate that the couple's background is shown through a series of rather dull flashbacks, thus giving their rapport very little time to truly flesh out. The fundamental failure to persuade the viewer that they were in an intimate relationship gives the story a rather dreary conviction throughout.It's all quite frustrating, as nothing feels as if it were done to its full potential. The Spy Who Dumped Me is essentially a less intelligent version of 2015's dazzlingly funny Spy (directed by Paul Feig), which saw Melissa McCarthy as the unwitting hero thrust into a shadowy worldwide scheme. In every way that Feig's film was sharp and streamlined, The Spy Who Dumped Me is tremendously bleak, epitomised by its careless emphasis on expletives, as if to cover up the incoherency of the plot.Morgan's character is at one point described as ""a little much"". Indeed, this phrase is probably truer of the film itself in that The Spy Who Dumped Me bites off more than it can chew, ultimately failing in its mission to produce an engaging espionage rib-tickler.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
167,joelnova93,"Charming, funnier than expected!",8,12 August 2018,"I'll concede that the film runs a bit long, but it is due to the film being a Jack-of-all-trades comedic spy thriller buddy film. It doesn't take itself seriously but throws all of its weight over the bar. I definitely had a smile the entire film. Mila Kunis & Kate McKinnon have impeccable chemistry, and I was really charmed seeing Kunis' character development over the film as McKinnon plays her Foil; an overly enthusiastic best friend. The real hidden gem of this film is Ivana Sahkno's assassin character. The actress is only 21 years old; she's gonna be a star!",The Spy Who Dumped Me

169,patrick-413,A fun adventure,7,8 April 2019,"No one is going to mistake this for a cinematic masterpiece, but I thought it was very well written and directed. They never let the ""fun"" aspect die down for more than a minute, they kept the stakes high throughout so you cared about the characters, and the plot never got in the way of the buddy-movie dynamics.Kate McKinnon had almost all of the laugh-out-loud lines (and there were a lot) simply because she's naturally hilarious, Kunis was her usual charming self (and believable as a novice badass), and of course Sam Heughan is always fine as an action lead.Overall I was quite entertained and surprised that there were so many good laughs. Even some of the cheaper laughs were well set-up and felt like a natural part of the dialog. Definitely recommended if you want to set your brain on ""neutral"" for a while and have some fun.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

She's a good actress. But Kate McKinnon is absolute garbage. Like. Trash. She literally played the same character with a different name in every movie or tv show she's ever done. It's sad to watch. She has no range and it was demonstrated in this movie. I appreciate the ""who done it"" factor. Kept me relatively interested. I wouldn't seek out to watch it again.

Well, The Spy Who Dumped Me doesn't rely on the same old, same old...not entirely.Yes there's action...yes parts of it are potty humor-ish...but with a bit of restraint and intelligence, this film delivers on another level. The two lead actresses were allowed to shine. Kate McKinnon gives us another zany, lovable character who is immensely fun to watch and listen to, while Mila Kunis, with her trademark sincerity, gives us a real woman...one who falls in love, and who hasn't quite found her way, and who drops f bombs (not every second, but just as much as any other ""red blooded American girl""...and yes, everyone knows where she was born.)I'll admit that I went into it with super low expectations, but I knew I wanted to see it, given the cast and how fun recent movies with strong female leads have been (Girl's Trip with Tiffany Haddish, Spy featuring Melissa McCarthy and 2017's Rough Night with its awesome ensemble cast).I say in the title of my review that I find it really suspicious that so many reviewers gave this either a 1 or a 10.You should, too!See it for yourself.

Reminds me of a funnier, livelier Matt Smith. Heughen could be the next Bond, or maybe some super hero character. Hunky, but with British charm, sophistication (he's Scottish).Great locations and action sequences. Budapest (standing in for Prague and Vienna) and Amsterdam.Snappy, current banter. Loved the status-conscious character Topher's running joke about Harvard. And MacKinon's ""best friend"" parents, played by Jane Curtain and Paul Reiser.And, the send up of spy movie tropes, like the fashion model/Russian gymnast turned assassin, McKinnon's turn as an accidental performer in a Cirque du Soleil scene, and Gillian Anderson's icy MI-6 head.Glad friends talked me in to seeing this on our Saturday, stay at home Amazon movie night.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Plus you cannot have hope with a Mila Kunis movie, it's either a big disappointment, or an o.k. I'll wait to see it on TV. Thank god Kate McKinnon was her co-star. She is has a great comic timing and made this movie surprisingly fun.
Watching in a theater in Freehold, NJ, there was a lot of laughs when McKinnon calls her mother in Freehold, NJ. Although Paul Reiser's small role he was great. There are a lot of plot twists and confusion even at the end, but still I was happily surprised. But they should find a movie that Kate McKinnon can take the lead. She has become one of my favorite actresses. If you really want to see her at her best, Ghostbusters role of Egon was spot on!

Not original in any sense of the word, down to the last very telegraphed 'twist' near the end - and even the obligatory stinger during the credits.Kate McKinnon is horribly miscast and not at all funny in this movie, she comes across as a less funny version of Will Ferrell - annoying more than funny, but I know some people like that. In fact her character is so annoying (and unfunny) you have to wonder why anyone would be friends with her, especially when she seems to care more about doing her thing than their friendship...or their life.Someone asked how gory the film was. There is copious amounts of blood, there is a full-frontal scene with a full-rear scene showing scrotum for extra measure. From the dialog preceding the scene, you already know it is coming - just like everything else in this movie. Whatever wasn't given away by the trailers is given away by the poor writing, but since none of it is original anyway...Don't buy or rent this, wait until one of the streaming services has it for free.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

I'm kinda wondering how did Lionsgate decide to do this? So you know movies like this one - they should have their own genre - too much inadequate which is kind a funny because men are pigs but when women want equilibrium they go on the big screen and start telling d*** jokes. Also somebody is killed but they reappear again somehow just to prolong the plot a but because shortage of jokes.

Like when they were reading the directory at the Austrian train station, their interaction with the two Australian girls, and when the model/Olympian/assassin could not locate the two American women from her sniper location. Lots of violence, but no more than a typical spy film. Sometimes the violence was treated very flippantly, but they are actors and it's a comedy movie..

Starting out as a couple of California gals who get caught up in an adventure is easy enough to get on board with, but some of the things they are doing by the end of the movie are just ridiculous to the point of being insulting.I usually love Kate McKinnon on SNL, but she was like an early Jim Cqrrey going over the top to steal every scene she's in. At some point some one would surely slap some sense into her, either her partner in the movie, or her director on the set. She did have some genuinely funny moments, but for the love of Pete, let the audience sit with it a minute before you break out your next attempt to make it all about you.

There are plenty of chuckle moments some good laughs, good and even great action, a simple but effective storyline, good acting, nice build up. Kate McKinnon gets better throughout the movie.

All I know about Mila Kunis' character is that her boyfriend just dumped her, she works retail and she has an annoying loud and obnoxious friend (who I also know next to nothing about). What does she want out of life other than to not feel hurt because her bf dumped her? I don't know. Maybe the bf thing was supposed to be enough. But it doesn't do anything to make her relateable to me. I need something more ... anything ... to make her not just an avatar on a screen.I watched about half of the movie and it was just two women that I know and care nothing about having things happen to them.

Kunis & McKinnon play believable Besties, & their characters have a good arc. They put that R rating to work, as some jokes can be crude, yet extremely funny. The action is exciting & gory, and there are a few good twists, as you'd expect from a spy flick. McKinnon's Morgan does get annoying with her incessant feminism, but by the end you may develop a case of envy from all the Bad-Ass women doing Kick-Ass stuff. You're very entertained, and leave wanting to hug your Bestie. There is one last scene as the credits begin, and a couple funny Mid-Credits interviews. I give this caper a Solid ""Shut-Up Meg"" rating 'cause it's a good alternative to The Meg.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Mila and Kate are simply perfect in their characters, and script made me really have a lot of fun. This action comedy isn't stupid at all, on the contrary is a perfectly made very difficult to write original script. Ironic, smart, quick, clever, the story takes place in different cities of mittel Europe and Paris and uses the ""geographic stereotypes"" in a fresh way. I am European and visited the cities several times, believe me when I say you the authors really kept the spirits of a spy story linked to those places. Actresses are fantastic.

This is a comedy in the best (or worst, depending on the point of view) traditions of the Wayans family: crass, disrespectful, camp, over-the-top, at times absolutely ludicrous, yet completely hilarious. I don't remember laughing so hard in quite a while.In general, U.S. directors are so afraid of offending someone and being panned by one or another religious/racial/interest group that they strip their comedies of any creativity, until it all turns into bland lukewarm porridge.This movie has no such qualms. Cutting off the thumb of someone and putting it into a lipstick case to unlock their phone over and over again? Why not? Sticking a flash drive into your private parts and then discussing the experience at length? Well, absolutely! This is what this movie is about, and this is what it does brilliantly. If you want to watch something refined and intelligent, just see something else.I can understand - to some extent -the negative reviews and the backlash from some of the public, but come on, guys.

I would have given it a much higher rating if not for a couple of things.1) The language. Mind you, I'm no saint... I've been know to curse like a sailor. Women in movies today seem to think that since guys do it, they want to do it to. I don't care who you are, when every other word out of a female's mouth is f-this and f-that... It's crass and off putting. A curse word here or there is to be expected, regardless of gender, but not over other word.2) Everything that Kate McKinnon is in is tainted with feminist propaganda. This was no exception. Throughout the movie, she'd pepper in a little ""girl power"" and ""teaching this guy feminism"" sound bites, but it really hit it's peak when Gillian Anderson walks in to the interrogation room. When McKinnon finds out that Scully (from the X-Files) is the guy's boss, she looses it. She goes on and on about ""why is she talking to these men when a women is in charge.""Cut out every scene with McKinnon and this movie would have rated 7, maybe even 8 stars.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

But Hollywood has decided to eliminate all adjectives and adverbs, replacing them with the F word. An occasional well-placed F bomb can be funny. But the constant profanity is distracting and, frankly, boring. If this is supposed to be realistic speech, it's not...unless it's drug-dealing .

I mean she is great on SNL but to watch her attempt at humor is intolerable for more than 5-7 minutes.This movie is a complete waste of time (thank god I didn't have to pay to watch it). There is absolutely no story line and it seems the whole purpose of the movie is to cater to the female empowerment crowd..

Of course it's a preposterous movie - that's the point! This is made for just shutting down reality and enjoying the comedic stylings of a couple of funny ladies on an unrealistic mission. If you can't just suspend reality for a couple of hours & enjoy a silly movie made for adults for once, then by all means, don't bother. It has gross parts, but even I, who gets queasy very easily, thought those parts were funny.

I love both lead ladies...but, could never figure out why one was serious and badass, while the other was a poorly scripted cartoon character. And for me...they broke the cardinal rule of big movie action pics....if you are going to show that much blood (and there is a ton), you can't just have the characters cracking jokes as people die or are dismembered.

I was in the mood for a laugh and some action. This movie surprisingly delivered both for me. Sure a very small number of jokes fell flat, but not many. It took me a little while to recognise Sam Heughan, (Jamie from Outlander, bestill my beating heart). Great action scenes. Justin Theroux, he's always a cool dude, the two girls, funny, the assassin chick, funny, the secret agent partner, funny, even Gillian Anderson made me laugh.
Long story short, just a fun action comedy, that doesn't require deep thought or the need to overanalyse. There were much worse movies released last year like, Fifty Shades Grey, Mama Mia - here we go again, or a very unpleasant tale called Caniba, (Japanese I think).

It was entertaining visually interesting faan funny acting was to perier. It was everything you'd want in a Saturday afternoon film. Good guys win bag guys lose. Best friends are best friends forever. Girl gets the guy. It was nice because they took a simple girl struggling and life and put her in a life-and-death struggle against evil. So of course that's not realistic but it does make for a fun filled movie. Always nice to see girls in body films.

The action scenes were actually well done for the most part, no shaky cam or extreme cuts for every move they pulled. The comedy can be a hit or miss, it was funny at times but other times it wouldn't click so I guess it just depends on your sense of humor. The plot is very cliché and predictable sadly and it's fine when a movie knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.

It's again promoting feminism, which Holiwood has always been doing in recent years, However, It's not a awkward rigid copy of man hero, e.g. female boss is unbeatable and much stronger physically than men.

Maybe shes ""a bit much"" to some, but I really enjoy her silliness and the chemistry she and Kunis share. Two beautiful, funny, smart and completely relatable best friends getting into secret spy shenanigans in Europe? Sign me tf up. I've watched it twice and I'll more than likely watch again.

It gets on your nerves to where it's all that you notice so it distracts you from the movie (which also is nothing special) maybe if you're a die hard fan of either of the leads you may enjoy it but if not I don't have much faith that you will enjoy it either.

Ex-boyfriend really doesn't want that though, so he calls her up and begs her to stop. The thing is, he's a spy and left something very valuable in her possession and suddenly Audrey and Morgan is on the run thru Europe trying to stay alive.There's loads of little gems in the script and the 2 women headlining the movie are doing an awesome job being normal girls put in an danger while not going the route of damsels in distress. My favorite scenes were in Amsterdam and Berlin, but I must admit I was thouroughly entertained all the way through.The plot is different, the female actors are funny, the man-candy is delicious - worth the trip to the cinema.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Kate McKinnon is as intensely funny here as she is on SNL and Mila Kunis did good playing the straight (wo)man or foil to the wacky Kate. We loved their friendship and how they supported each other through thick and thin, silliness and danger.There are not many action comedy films with female-centric stories, so if critics are comparing this to male action buddy movies, they are already biased about what is or is not funny based on male stereotypes. This film pokes fun at those male behavioral cliches and also shows the female BFF perspective.

As for acting, it was good.. I am a fan of Mila Kunis myself and she is a great actress, so the movie's problem wasn't really about acting.
Moving on to an important spot, which is ""The Plot""
The plot was really really poor. There were two things about it, either too predictable (I could predict some events throughout), or way unimportant and boring.
Now the Comedy. I think it wasn't bad, I've had a few smiles throughout the movie but still had no laughs.But tbh I think the movie wasn't that bad and maybe I thought that way because I had high hopes for it.

After the last tank/bomb of a movie with Kunis in it I figured she had learned - and this one was definitely better than the last one she did. I was in a half packed theater and everyone seemed to have the same response - some scattered laughs here and there, but never really the constant laugh-out-loud comedy that we were hoping for. One thing I noticed was that in her last movie it was filled with f-bombs and all of the younger folks seemed to roll with laughter each time she cursed. The audience this time was pretty mixed for age and the f-bombs never got even a chuckle from what I observed - even though they were plenty of them. Without the language I could have even taken my kids to see it, but not a chance with the amount of swearing it contained. Overall a bit disappointed from the cursing and lack of laughs not already seen in the trailers.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

The girl from the new Ghostbusters is usually good for a laugh or two but even she doesn't have it for this one. I've fallen asleep watching this enormous waste of time twice and it's still not over.

360,danielle_davis94,"A funny spy movie, who knew?",10,27 August 2018,"When I went to watch this I had VERY low expectations, I arrived a bit late and what I wanted to watch was already 15 minutes in, so I went to see this instead.
I was SO happy that I was late, I laughed so much during this film, most of the time when a film is described as 'comedy' I find the jokes more uncomfortable than funny, this film had some great one liners and comedic timing.
The action part was good, unlike some films it wasn't all action all the time, it had some great plot points and twists, and my favorite part was the fact that Audrey and Morgan who are just two ordinary women didn't immediately become amazing super spy's 10 minutes into the film, and it shows that a lot of the time they were lucky or even just accidentally managing to do things right.
So as this film is billed as comedy/action, I believe it meets both of those criteria, and the people who see COMEDY and expect it to be just like a bond film or a Mission Impossible film should really reconsider what they think comedy is.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Hollywood seems to think that their voice is what we want to hear when it comes to politics! When will they learn, we go to the movie to get away from crap like that. It's getting to where I could care less to watch TV or go to a movie because they do nothing but try to shove their sexual and political views down your throat. Most of these actors are total losers and nut jobs in real life which is what makes a great actor. The movie was predictable from the get go. The only part of would have to say was the boyfriend that was killed. I will leave it at that. The rest, simple to see coming and the acting was less than perfect was too much over the top scenes for my family's taste. We almost had to leave after the 5 political poke less than 30 minutes into this wasted of a time movie! I was hoping for a better comedy but they can't see to stop trying to brainwash us into their way of thinking! Get over it already, Hillary lost and Obama sucked as a President!

It's more of a comedic parody of a spy movie than an actual typical spy movie, so if you expect a typical thriller, you'll be disappointed.

375,greenleigh,This one is a mess,3,12 November 2018,"This movie was a mess. The writers couldn't seem to make up their minds whether this was supposed to be a buddy adventure comedy or an action thriller. The violence in the movie was too intense for a comedy; or even a spoof on spy films. And the plot was certainly too silly for an action flick. Kate McKinnon was the reason I wanted to see this movie; I really enjoy her work on SNL. But both female leads offered up performances that felt forced and silly. Actually, the whole movie felt forced and silly. I would give it a miss; or maybe wait for Saturday night and smoke some weed before you settle in to watch this one.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
376,cb718679,Derivative drivel of a waste of time.,1,20 August 2018,"This poorly executed excuse of a comedy - from its tired title to its forced acting - tried to be everything at once and ended up being nothing at all. When you have names like Mila's, Kate's and Gillian's, one would expect a modicum of subtly and finesse to let these strong performers elevate the material as they've been known to, but when the material itself is as blunt as a sledgehammer, there's not much anyone can do to elevate it. The jokes were forced (Kate is a naturally funny woman, yet even her boundless talent can't save this film), the ""romance"" shoehorned in unnecessarily (rare to see such a chemistry-less duo as mila and sam) and the performances forgettable - no matter how hard Sam Heughan tries to be a Bond-type male lead, he'll be nothing but a cheap imitation parody. A boy trying to play with the men. Suffice it to say, nothing about this movie screams memorable or worthwhile, a 1 out of 10 is being generous.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

378,rebeccajallings,"A charming, funny spy story--with, as the NYTimes says, a high body count",10,8 August 2018,"The coolest thing about The Spy Who Dumped Me is that it is part of an extremely small group of films made recently-a series of genre shifting women's movies: Spy, Heat, Ghostbusters, Oceans 8, Bridesmaids, Trainwreck, etc. Each one of these films has pushed against the paternalistic idea that women should not try to be funny and they certainly should not be anything but set dressing in any action movie. And there has been a good deal of pushback from male critics, who outnumber women critics-four out of five critics are men who seem to frequently have trouble seeing past their own gender. After all, women in comedy/action movies are a rarity. (Always check the gender of the critic before you read a review.)There is a lot of negative pressure on women in the entertainment world who want to be funny. This film had a lot of what one could call women's humor, and it was glorious to hear the laughter from the women in the audiences. These characters were definitely resourceful. They made plans and they carried them out. Yes, men helped them here and there-and then got shot so the women had to figure stuff out on their own-which they had already done. We just didn't know what they had done, yet.The action is fast and the story has a number of turns and twists, plus, they travel through a bunch of beautiful cities in Europe, which I always love. Sam Heughan, the male lead in the Starz show, Outlander, is the reason most of the women in the audience were there. He's a fine actor and an extremely good looking man who did an exceptional job, making what could have been a simple throwaway role, full of mystery and dorkiness, one right after the other. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Is he smart or dumb? Hasan Minhaj does a superb job at being a jerk, and Justin Theroux is tremendously slimy and awful, consistently underestimating Mila Kunis completely. And Mila Kunis turns in a top notch performance, switching back and forth between a dangerous gun toting broad and a scared little girl who needs to be saved. Trust me, her character doesn't need to be saved. Kate McKinnon is one of the best comediennes in the country right now and is at the top of her game in this film. She is a joy to watch. The two of them are fabulous together. As Mila said in several interviews, she and Kate ""fell in love"" with each other after only ten minutes, and it shows. You would bet a lot of money that they have been best friends for a very long time.I do especially admire the men in the cast for signing on to a movie in which their gender precludes any kind of leading roles. I mean, the women mention vaginas, for god's sake.The writer/director is also a woman, Susanna Fogel. You done good here, Susanna.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Kate McKinnon shines in this movie and her humor overshadows Mila Kunis. Through no fault of her own Mila Kunis's character seemed basic and lacking development on her character. On the contrary Kate's character was very funny throughout and extremely awkward.

Which is exactly what I got, lots of the usual overly exaggerated Hollywood style action shots with the same kind of emotionless funny character with straight character scenario type humour you have seen a million times before. Not once did I come across a laugh out loud moment or even a chuckle, it was all so predictable. Then the amount of deaths is way over the top. This would have been a good film if they had made it a little bit more realistic. Have consequences such as police ! You don't just have car chases with gun toting villains shooting and at the end everyone going about as if this was a normal day, at least have some police getting involved. Then for the actors get them to show some real emotions to what is happening, rather than not being affected in any way by the mass slaughter which just took place. This is simply a over hollwooded movie void of all realism and emotions, it is a situation comedy where the situation creates next to know comedy. Pure mass produced dribble.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

I can't understand why people are tearing this movie apart. Of course it's going to be ridiculous. It's about spies? Sorry if you were expecting realism in a SPY movie??Part of why this movie feels so unique to me is because throughout the whole film, the friendship between Mika Kunis and Kate McKinnon is center stage. There's the cute British spy who is the obvious set up for Mila Kunis, sure, but it's still mostly focused on the friendship between the two women protagonists. They don't turn against each other or tear each other apart. It's easy to turn women against each other for comedy. There's a LOT of comedic opportunity when having women fight, but this film found other ways to bring in humor and it did it well.The action in the movie is great, the comedy is great, and the movie as a whole is great.

The acting (other than Theroux) is pretty good. Not the biggest fan of McKinnon but she is talented. Mila Kunis is great and her growth during the film is the only thing the director/writer was able to do wellWorst part of this movie are all the holes.

On SNL, there's a recurring cringeworthy sketch where Kate McKinnon's character graphically describes her alien abduction. That SNL character - and the vulgarity - is exactly how McKinnon's character is written in this film, and it's terrible. Now imagine Kunis' whining character from That 70's Show, because that's exactly how she plays this character. It's difficult to believe that they are best friends. And yet somehow these dingdong ladies manage to outmaneuver the enormous number of spies at every turn. This film wasn't funny, and the plot was extremely thin and predictable.

I was literally on the edge of my seat with anticipation during the car chase scene. The last scene made me involuntarily exclaim ""Holy Crap"" and as soon as the movie ended my friend and I looked at each other and said ""Sequel! Now!""

459,mmasek-1108,"Confusing, complicated ... and not even a little bit funny.",2,15 November 2021,"First, let me say that I love Mila Kunis and I adore Kate McKinnon.That said, I imagine this movie started with a producer calling them and saying, ""Hey, wanna make a fun, funny, action, adventure, spy movie? We'll pay you a lot of money, and we'll film in Budapest and Amsterdam (for no apparent reason). You'll get to do lots of exciting, crazy things, and then we'll pay to send you on a huge international press tour when the movie comes out. Whattaya think?""Unfortunately for Kunis and McKinnon, they both said yes.Briefly, Kunis finds out that her new boyfriend is an international spy, and she and McKinnon get dragged into his mission to save the world. The details don't matter, which is good because there aren't many details. And wacky hi-jinks ensue. There's lots of European scenery, car chases, shootings, crosses, double-crosses, triple-crosses, people you think were dead return, and by the end, you don't know who to believe or what's real. And you don't care. To enjoy this movie, you not only have to suspend your disbelief, you have to expel it and forget that it ever existed.This is the type of movie where a group of highly trained assassins have the hero cornered and start shooting, but they all miss. The hero dodges all their bullets, and quickly kills them all. One of the characters, in the middle of a public Cirque du Soleil-type show, suddenly remembers.their training from clown school and becomes an expert aerialist.All of this could be forgiven if the movie was actually funny. It's not. Kunis spends most of her time looking surprised and trying to figure out what's going on (along with the audience), while McKinnon is the apparent ""comic relief,"" doing her best with terrible material. (As an example, her character's name is Morgan Freeman, and they never go anywhere with that. They just throw it out there. And that might be one of the funniest lines in the movie.)The male stars, Justin Theroux and Sam Heughan, were stiff and emotionless. By the end, I didn't care who lived or died, who was on which side, or what happened to the flash drive. I just wanted it all to be over. Gillian Anderson, Jane Curtain and Paul Reiser show up just long enough for you to say, ""Hey, there's Gillian Anderson, Jane Curtain and Paul Reiser."" And then they're gone.With a much better script, this could have actually been a fun, funny, action, adventure, spy movie. But it's not.",The Spy Who Dumped Me
460,schalazeal,"Funny and Fun, Critics be Damned.",8,14 August 2018,"Really glad I didn't let critics dissuade me from seeing this one. Many strikes might be called against the film, but a lack of chemistry between Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon should not be one of them. Those two are comedy magic together. The odd-couple dynamic is perhaps more a result of McKinnon's naturally irreverent energy, which is just fine; their interactions still had an organic feel amidst the film's histrionics and wild action. It was in fact their smaller, seemingly dismissible moments together that made the relationship feel genuine and identifiable. How refreshing to watch a story in which the two (female) main characters' strong bond is treated as an absolute given--it's more rare than you think (I mean, doesn't it sometimes feel like movies have trained viewers to equate character conflict with chemistry? But I digress).Beyond the two leads, the movie had a super solid cast all around. Some actors might have even been underutilized when you consider their immense acting talents...but still, gold stars to the casting director(s) for pulling together such a strong ensemble, as well as for taking a chance on a few actors otherwise known for more dramatic roles.Much of the film's weaknesses seem to be with the plot, which was a bit too uninspired and derivative even for a film that is meant to invoke (and presumably subvert?) certain spy movie tropes. But that being said, I legit laughed out loud throughout the whole film, and wouldn't mind watching it again. Going to consider that success enough.(By the way, can we please take a moment to give snaps to Sam Heughan?! I adore him already but he was fantastic; he reverses the typical Bond-girl role well and puts in a nicely understated performance ... if Hollywood doesn't scoop him up for lead roles ASAP, they're idiots.)",The Spy Who Dumped Me

If you go into it expecting to have fun, then you'll have a good time.Do yourself a favor and don't watch too many of the ads for this movie. Many of the good gags and surprises were, for me, spoiled by all of the ads online. But, there were still some good surprises and fun jokes.The action sequences are worthy of any Bond movie out there. The chemistry between Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis is believable. They really do seem to be having fun. The jokes are funny. The theme of female empowerment comes across well without being too preachy. Some of the twists were kind of predictable, others you never see coming. Sam Heughan smolders beautifully throughout the movie and brings a kind of subtle innocence to the role of Sebastian that was refreshing to see in a Bond-type character. He should be considered for any future Bond casting, as he would make a great Bond a la Roger Moore. It was fun watching Gillian Anderson play the straight-laced Uber serious government agent that she plays so well, juxtaposed with Kate McKinnon's manic silliness.There are plenty of problems, as others have pointed out, but if you can suspend your disbelief, don't think too much about it, and enjoy it for what it is, a female-led action buddy comedy, you will have a good time.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

I was slightly surprised but definitely not thrown off my feet. Getting the bad out the way, this movie had no real character development. It just thrusts you, and the characters, into the story and takes off from there with the action. Milas's performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. She simply just plays her role alongside everybody else. Kate McKinnon pretty much stole the show! Even though that's a good thing for her, it's not for the movie as far as balance is concerned. The action scenes are good, but nothing special. There is no real struggle fight between characters. Either one person comes through taking multiple people down with fancy moves, or someone gets lucky, or lets their guard down...or simply gets shot. That's not to say the action is bad!The comedy is pretty much what carries the movie. The humor will definitely hit or miss. Either you will laugh or think to yourself ""that wasn't that funny"".

You don't even have to watch the screen to love the dialog. (I listened to the soundtrack with a headset without watching the screen because I was doing other things.) When describing this movie to others, I say that this is a ""chick flick"" lacking a better term or a politically correct term. I mean by ""chick flick"" that the film comes from a woman's perspective, which I do not often perceive. The only nudity is a flash of complete male nudity. The screen writer is a woman. Some of the jokes are jokes that men don't write or cannot write. If you want to know how a very smart, courageous, self-aware woman thinks, I think this script provides clues. (How would I know, though, being a man?) The criticism of ""ordinary"" young people is scathing. That millennials are the target of some of the better jokes might explain the negative reviews.The negative reviews must be from people from another planet (or time).

I couldn't believe how realistic it looked.There were several chase scenes and fights that were just as good. I will probably watch it again this weekend. LOL",The Spy Who Dumped Me

Don't believe all the negative reviews because those who criticize others do it out of jealousy that comes from doing nothing productive with their own lives!,The Spy Who Dumped Me
490,jessicarempel,Entertaining film until the end,7,3 January 2021,"Who can argue with the Kate McKinnon comedy, the early-on action scenes, and stunning European views for the first 91 minutes? Seriously funny and fun film... Until you realize that the movie is just setting up Kunis (the ""hot one"") for another love interest, and the ""funny one"" just gets to, uh, out her career dream as a spy? Why can't the funny wingwoman ever end up with love instead of the hot, less-confident, and only marginally-funny one?",The Spy Who Dumped Me

492,amxndascott,A fun and thrilling ride with a little something in it for everyone,10,11 August 2018,"I don't know what you're expecting when you sit down to watch The Spy Who Dumped me, but I can tell you that what you're going to get is a whole lot more.For as long as I can remember I've been watching men do goofy comedies with no substance, or high-octane action films where they're almost always inevitably rescuing a damsel in distress. This is DIFFERENT.In this one, I can see myself as one of these girls-- someone who was minding her own business and one day got thrown into an extraordinary circumstance. Someone who tries her best to help where she can, and both leans on and is a helping hand to her very best friend, who she sticks with through everything instead of breaking apart over some small, catty plot device used to get us to the third act.The Spy Who Dumped Me is great. It's FUNNY, and the action is REAL. The friendship is wholesome, and the characters have a depth you don't always get from a film that's billed as a comedy. Mila Kunis is brilliant, and Kate McKinnon both steals the show, and works hard to let the other players shine. The humor ranges from clever multi-language puns, to the low-brow poop jokes-- it's something for everyone. And honestly, what it really boils down to is this: If you go into it expecting to hate it, you will. And if you buy your tickets expecting to have fun, ohhhh man, you're gonna have the BEST two hours. Enjoy!",The Spy Who Dumped Me

494,dmk-04205,"Lame, Predictable, Bad Acting Don't waste your time nor money!",1,5 August 2018,"This movie was saved by Kate Mc Kinnon...she was the best part of this movie with little comedy (save for those parts where McKinnon was allowed to express herself) a lot of gunfire, weak attempt at emulating Bond movies and others. I almost walked becuase it had cheesy dialogue, predictable plot, lame scenes, lack of substance to sustain any genre. I was bored save for the funny lines from Mc Kinnon.. Don't waste your time nor money on this lame film. Best part was towards the end. I was anxious for it to end...Too long to withstand such blah, lackluster, non intriguing film. Mila was ...Meh! Looks pathetic in pants. Certain dresses fare her better. She is no big deal. Mc Kinnon onthe other hand, can be hilarious, very attractive, smart, on the road to being an excellent actor!",The Spy Who Dumped Me
495,hunnmicki-38038,I REALLY wanted to like this movie,3,29 August 2019,"I really, really wanted to like this movie but it's just not good. I usually enjoy watching Mila Kunis and I'm a big fan of Sam Heughan, but this is just as flat as beer bread without the beer. It was painful to watch Kate McKinnon's performance - utterly atrocious. If this was meant to be a satire, the director totally missed the mark. It could have been a really funny comedy with an improved plot and better writing and probably a different director, too. There were some funny moments, but only enough to make this a ""fair"" rating instead of plain old ""bad."" I stuck it out all the way hoping that it would get better. Sadly, it did not. I don't know what could have made this cast accept these roles unless they were doing a favor for a close friend, owed someone a favor, were being blackmailed, or that it looked good on paper but got completely butchered in post-production.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

This film was hilarious from start to finish. Hugely witty, with smart humour in layers throughout. What a refreshing retake on the bond theme. So obviously written/directed by a woman that really understand female relationships unlike the crass Bad Moms 2 which became noticeably out of touch with real women from the first sexual references. 
Hope they don't deter people from attending this wild, fun, upbeat film that had us all chatting about it for hours. So well-written. And my money is on Sam Jamie Fraser for the next bond.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

The Spy Who Dumped Me lifts plots and characters directly from that earlier movie. Unlike Boned Us, which has actual big screen talent, Dumped Me only hopes that it can succeed with the addition of Saturday Night Live comedians. But this film proves why those people are on the small screen. Nor does Dumped Me have any of the subversive subtext of the movie it steals so gleefully from. If you like whack and spoof with intelligence, go see the original. If you enjoy vapid and tired, watch this one.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

518,upup_and_away,"Funny, fast and freaking COOL.",10,6 August 2018,"First of all, this movie is funny as hell. Every line is a joke, whether it be subtle or in your face. Secondly, the action is LEGIT. It's incredible how Fogel pulled off two very specific and different genres and made both aspects so strong. Thirdly, my personal favorite thing about this film is where the tension comes from; rather than the conflict coming from the two ladies' relationship (like it does in a most movies centered around female friends), it is driven by the action and plot. Not only does this show how strong Fogel and Iserson's use of story is, but it represents a real version of female friendship. Rather than pitting the two women against each other (like society coerces women to do daily), this film shows that when women are supportive, encouraging team mates to one another, they can achieve much more than if they are constantly competing.",The Spy Who Dumped Me

If you see stuff coming, it does not surprise you and thus it cannot be funny.Watched the movie 2 weeks ago in a preview, so I did not know what movie would be shown.
