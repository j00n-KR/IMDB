0,TheLittleSongbird,"It is okay, but it is disappointing",5,25 September 2010,"Beverly Hills Cop is a classic, but this one while not awful was a disappointment in comparison. The set pieces are spectacular, Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold are good together and individually, Jurgen Prochnov and Brigitte Nielson suitably ham it up, the film is assuredly directed and it moves briskly. However, what is missing is a good enough story and a decent script. The story is sadly quite predictable, and the script is also unfunny and lacking sorely in wit. The soundtrack isn't as memorable either and while flashy some of the production values make little impact. Overall, it is okay but in comparison to the wonderful original it is lacking. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Beverly Hills Cop II
1,Leofwine_draca,Superior sequel,6,9 March 2012,"I have to say that I found BEVERLY HILLS COP II an improvement over the first film in the series, as it's very much a different style of movie more catered towards my taste. This time around, the emphasis is less on the comedy and more on the action, which is little surprise given the presence of Tony Scott as director.Scott is, by far, the best thing about this movie. He creates one slick set-piece after another, whether it's a destructive vehicle chase or a climatic shoot-out, and overall his is a film which looks expensive and stylish. Really, this is a forerunner of all those Michael Bay epics clogging up cinema screens over the last decade.The script is worse than in the original, especially when it comes to the comedy. Although Murphy is better - more confident and assured - as Foley, his routines feel a little repetitive and tiresome especially when he fast-talks somebody in his way for the umpteenth time. Still, the supporting cast is strong and when everyone's having as much fun as they are here, it's difficult to complain too much.",Beverly Hills Cop II
2,SnoopyStyle,Axel Foley is back,7,20 July 2014,"There is a gang of robbers led by Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen) on the loose in Beverly Hills leaving notes. Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) went to the FBI for help in investigating the Alphabet crimes. Bogamil gets suspended while Rosewood and Taggart (John Ashton) gets downgraded to traffic by Chief Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield). Then Fry ambushes Bogamil and leaves him near death. Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) comes out to Beverly Hills to solve the Alphabet case and find who shot Bogamil. Taggart is reluctant but the guys help Foley to investigate. It leads to Karla Fry, Charles Cain (Dean Stockwell) and Maxwell Dent (Jürgen Prochnow).Axel Foley is back. That's all that's really needed to be said here. Eddie Murphy is loud and he's irreverent. The second one is more flashy and the Hollywood action is slicker but essentially it's the same movie. The flashier style is probably due to director Tony Scott. While some people may not like the weird Brigitte Nielsen, the first one had the weird Serge. It's a joke-a-minute action machine. Also I didn't realize that Chris Rock was in this one with a small role. It's nice to see.",Beverly Hills Cop II
3,classicsoncall,"""You can never have too much firepower!""",7,23 May 2021,"This is a fun sequel to ""Beverly Hills Cop"", though lacking somewhat in the creativity of the original. Eddie Murphy however is as kinetic and funny as ever, as he bowls you over with his quick banter, facial expressions, and farcical dialog that you really have to listen for because it doesn't always make sense. Like the idea of a 'sound seeking projectile' - seems reasonable if you hear it quick, but when you analyze it you know right away that it's nonsense. The Gerald Ford bit with Sergeant Taggart (John Ashton) was a head scratcher for this viewer, but apparently the clientele at the Hollywood hangout gave it a standing ovation. The Hugh Hefner cameo was a neat touch as the film gave his Playboy Mansion a huge promo spot; I'm sure business there picked up a notch after the movie came out. Funny, but even while Taggart and Billy (Judge Reinhold) were busted to traffic duty, they never found their way to a busy intersection except to snarl traffic with a handful of vehicle chases. The whole Alphabet case was handled fairly easily here by the reuniting cop trio, with some of the bad guys getting dispatched just a bit too easily. But you can't keep a good franchise down, as the series moves on to another sequel with ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" in a few more years.",Beverly Hills Cop II
4,gavin6942,Possibly Better Than the First!,7,31 December 2012,"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) investigate Chief Bogamil's near-fatal shooting and the series of ""alphabet crimes"" associated with it.So, how do you top the greatest action comedy of all time? You bring in director Tony Scott (""Top Gun"") to spruce up the action, car chases and explosions. You also improve Judge Reinhold's character. In the first film, he was more or less just background. Here, he has a personality and is even more eccentric than Foley himself! I did like the nods to Sylvester Stallone. Casting his wife, putting his posters up all over... it was like a consolation prize for backing out of the first film.",Beverly Hills Cop II
5,jboothmillard,Beverly Hills Cop II,4,6 February 2012,"The first film was a fantastically fun film that made the leading actor a huge star, famous especially for his motormouth style, and so naturally the makers wanted to cash in with the success with a sequel not long later, from director Tony Scott (Top Gun, True Romance, Enemy of the State). Basically Detroit cop Det. Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) watches the news broadcast from Beverly Hills and is shocked to see that his friend Capt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) was shot by a tall woman, and he rushes to go and see him in hospital. He is reunited with cop partners Det. William 'Billy' Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Det. Sgt. John Taggart (John Ashton) who may at times want to stick to the rules of the law, and who Police Chief Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield) is trying to fire, but they are also very keen to find the person who tried to kill Bogomil. Going on as they investigate the attempted murder are a series of specific robberies, being called the Alphabet Robberies, as the perpetrator leaves behind clues, an alphabet letter, in chronological order. The robberies seem to be masterminded by weapons kingpin Maxwell Dent (Jürgen Prochnow), and Axel and his two chums have a key suspect for who tried to kill Bogomil, especially in the criminal's tall blonde girlfriend, and gun expert, Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen). Axel follows all the clues that are leading to both the robberies and the murder attempt, using all forms of manipulation and conning to get past those that get in his way, and his motormouth antics do come in handy in the situations he gets into, and of course in the end the case is solved. Also starring Dean Stockwell as Charles 'Chip' Cain, Paul Reiser as Det. Jeffrey Friedman, Gilbert R. Hill as Insp. Douglas Todd, Paul Guilfoyle as Nikos Thomopolis and Robert Ridgely as Mayor Ted Egan. Murphy does still create some good giggles with his fast trash talking behaviour to get his own way, and supporting cast members Reinhold and Ashton again are great characters to join in the fun, the only cast member you can complain about is Nielsen putting on another silly foreign villain accent. There were some alright chase sequences, and one or two reasonable psychical and dialogue based jokes, it isn't as good as the first film of course, it is a not too terrible action comedy sequel. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Shakedown"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it won the Razzie for Worst Original Song for George Michael's ""I Want Your Sex"". Okay!",Beverly Hills Cop II
6,Tweekums,Eddie Murphy is back in an inevitable sequel,7,21 August 2016,"When Detroit cop Axel Foley learns that his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil of the Beverly Hills Police Department has been shot while investigating the so-called 'Alphabet Thieves' he tells his own boss that he is going deep, deep undercover on a local case before flying out to Los Angeles to help find those responsible. Once there he discovers that Rosewood and Taggart have been relegated to traffic duty by the officious new Chief of Police inevitably this doesn't stop them investigating the thieves. It isn't too long before he figures out that Maxwell Dent is behind the crimes but it won't be easy to prove as he doesn't get personally involved; instead he leaves the dirty work to his assistant; the six foot blonde Karla Fry.After the success of the original 'Beverly Hills Cop' it was inevitable that there would be a sequel. I don't think this is quite as good as the first but it is still pretty good and has plenty of laughs. Eddie Murphy once again impresses as Axel Foley and Judge Reinhold and John Ashton make a welcome return as Rosewood and Taggart there has been some amusing character development for Rosewood since we last saw him; he seems to have an unhealthy interest in weaponry which disturbs his partner. The criminals aren't quite as interesting as the original film; it is hard to believe that witnesses wouldn't have been able to help identify Brigitte Nielsen's Karla Fry. Some of the gags feel like rehashes of ones from the original film but that doesn't mean they don't work. Once again we have a gratuitous visit to a strip club and if that wasn't enough they have to gate-crash the Playboy Mansion where lots of bikini clad beauties are dancing around as well as a cameo from Hugh Hefner himself. Given that Tony Scott took over the direction it isn't surprising that there is more action and that action is pretty impressive. Overall a decent enough sequel that fans of the original are likely to enjoy.",Beverly Hills Cop II
7,ma-cortes,Murphy's back one more time with his classic character and loads of action,6,9 December 2005,"In this second film about notorious Detroit detective , the foul-mouth and tough Axel Foley (Edddie Murphy) again returns at Beverly Hills to resolve the responsible for the murder of his chief (Ronny Cox) who has been gunned down by a tall woman (Brigitte Nielsen). He decides to track down and clues lead to alphabet robberies that are masterminded by a weapons kingpin . As always , he's helped by a pair of sympathetics mates (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) . They'll have to confront evil nasties (Jurgen Prochnow and Dean Stockwell) and hold numerous risks , odds and dangers . The picture is plenty of action , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing . The picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectacular scenes and unstopped-action. Relief comic is in charge of Eddie Murphy as his foul and fast-talking creates most big smiles and causing wreak havoc on the way . Besides his various jokes with the sidekicks steal enormous laughs . For that the picture is a ¨Buddy movie¨ though there's a trio protagonist . Eddie Murphy as streetsmart detective is top-notch, as Axel Foley is his greatest smash-hit and converted him in a top-international-star confirming his position with continued successes in the box office . Fish out water formula used in several films is well narrated and originates enough laughters to satisfy the viewer . The giant Briggite Nielsen -just married to Stallone- is attractive and cold . Friends' couple , Judge Reinhold and John Ashton , are nice and likable . Director Tony Scott stunningly scoring highest marks on action , as the film is correctly made . Motion picture will appeal to action-packed enthusiasts and Eddie Murphy fans.",Beverly Hills Cop II
8,BA_Harrison,Beverly Hills Crap.,4,2 October 2018,"Motormouth Detroit cop Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to the glamorous world of L.A. to help pals Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) find those responsible for shooting Chief Bogomil (Ronny Cox). Foley's investigation leads him to criminal mastermind Maxwell Dent (Jürgen Prochnow) and his crew of gun-toting thugs, led by statuesque blonde Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen).WIth Beverly Hills Cop II, Top Gun director Tony Scott once again proves himself no slouch when it comes to stylish visuals and gung-ho action, but he completely drops the ball regarding laughs by giving his star free rein. Rather than coax a tempered performance from his ebullient lead, Scott allows him to ad-lib wildly in a self-indulgent manner that displays zero concern for quality, Murphy clearly under the illusion that everything he says or does is comedy gold. It isn't.Working loosely from a script co-written by Murphy, the supporting cast flounders amidst a sea of woefully unfunny scenes that include Foley squatting in a luxurious mansion, pretending to be a pool maintenance man, crashing a party at the Playboy mansion and generally being rude and obnoxious to almost everyone he meets. A crashtastic chase scene and a gun crazy finale end the film in a riot of wrecked cars and dead bodies, but cannot save this film from being a massive disappointment.",Beverly Hills Cop II
9,moonspinner55,Alphabet crimes in a by-the-numbers script...,3,1 April 2017,"After 1982's ""48 Hrs."" made him a movie star and 1984's ""Beverly Hills Cop"" made him a superstar, it was disheartening then to see Eddie Murphy make the safe decision to star in sequels to both films instead charting higher ground. Still, Murphy's return here as streetwise Axel Foley from Detroit--as well as his reunion with his likable ""Cop"" co-stars John Ashton and Judge Reinhold--seemed to make a lot of people happy, even if Tony Scott's 'chic' direction turns the whole overproduced thing into a dislocated ""Miami Vice"" rerun. A seemingly unstoppable terrorist ring in Beverly Hills, led by a statuesque platinum blonde female, has left the police captain shot up and on life support and his lead detective and sergeant busted down to traffic duty; feeling loyal to the friends he made on the force when he infiltrated Beverly Hills in 1984, Foley volunteers his services. Perhaps as an incentive to get Murphy on-board, the star was given a co-credit for originating the story, though there isn't much of one. Duty-bound Foley cons his way passed secretaries and security guards--he even tries to b.s. Hugh Hefner!--but the posh hot spots he stakes out merely seem chosen for their photogenic qualities (the plot being negligible). However minor the first film was, it did have a squirrelly charm that is missing this time. Self-enamored, self-amused Murphy does work hard, though even the camaraderie between he and his co-stars feels rote. *1/2 from ****",Beverly Hills Cop II

11,hitchcockthelegend,The heat is just about still on.,6,16 December 2009,"Wise-cracking Detroit cop Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills after learning his friend Captain Bogomil has been shot. Teaming up again with his cop buddies, Rosewood & Taggart, Foley tries to track down the ""alphabet"" bandit responsible for Bogomil's shooting.Riding in on the crest of a wave success of the first film, Beverly Hills Cop 2 bites off more than it can chew. Gone is director Martin Brest and into the chair comes ""fresh from Top Gun"" Tony Scott. There's no Daniel Petrie Jr in the writing office, instead there's something like 6 others involved, including Murphy, who with his star firmly on the rise is involved perhaps just a little too much.The Foley fish out of water scenario has just about enough life in it to keep it zippy, thanks in the main to Murphy and his interplay with the enjoyable Ashton and Reinhold as Taggart & Rosewood respectively. And Scott has a wail of a time with the action set-pieces; the director fully embracing the belief that a sequel should have more wham bang for the buck. Where this sequel fails miserably is with its one note, sign posted villains. The multitude of writers admirably attempt to put a dark gun running theme in the story, but Messrs Dean Stockwell, Jurgen Prochnow and Brigitte Nielsen are in turn poorly written, pointless and dull.But hey! This is the Murphy show, there's fun to be had as he uses his cocky bluffer skills to great effect. Be it a Carribbean psychic, a building inspector or Hugh Heffner's pool cleaner, Murphy once again proves what a comic talent he really was. An ill advised further sequel would follow 7 years later, proof positive that you can only milk a once winning formula so much. 6/10",Beverly Hills Cop II

13,zardoz-13,Tony Scott's Magic Makes It!!!,10,29 December 2014,"Three years after the original ""Beverly Hills Cop"" came out and astonished audiences, this charismatic sequel followed with Eddie Murphy in top form. Indeed, this is the kind of sequel where members of the original cast find themselves in jeopardy. As it turns out, Captain Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox of ""Deliverance"") gets gunned down a long-legged doll Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen of ""Red Sonja"") and before you can snap your fingers, Detriot Detective Alexl Foley is off to Los Angeles to unravel the case of the 'Alphabet Crimes.' Naturally, Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhoold) and Sergeant John Taggart (John Aston) are on the case, too, but their efforts are mitigated by a cluelessly incompetent Police Chief Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield of ""Nashville""),who has more than enough encounters with Axel. The eerie villains are led the sinister Maxwell Dent (Jürgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot"")and they have big plans that Axel foils. Meanwhile, in Detriot, Axel has his partner Detective Jeffrey Friedman (Paul Reiser) run interference for him with his departmental nemesis Inspector G. Douglas Todd (Gilbert Hill of ""Beverly Hills Cops"") while he is off cavorting in Beverly Hills. Tony Scott helms the action with his usual polish and ""Beverly Hill Cops 2"" looks pretty slick with its babes and its gunfights.",Beverly Hills Cop II
14,view_and_review,An Excellent Part Two,8,1 September 2019,"Let's be honest. Axel Foley would much prefer to be in Beverly Hills than Detroit. That's the real reason he went back to Beverly Hills. Who could blame him?As far as the script had it; his friend and captain of the Beverly Hills police force was shot. The culprit: the alphabet killer (or maybe alphabet robber). Axel Foley, in typical Axel Foley fashion, whisked into town to help find Captain Cox's assailants. He was brash, he was boisterous, and he was funny. On top of that the movie was well written and it was a big production. The criminals were big time, they were a step ahead of the law, and Axel used small yet important clues to track the bad guys. This was an excellent part two.",Beverly Hills Cop II
15,evanston_dad,Unnecessary Sequel Does Everything Wrong,2,23 June 2008,"A terrible and unpleasant sequel to the surprise hit from 1984.Though it reassembles most of the cast from the original, including Eddie Murphy in the role that made him a big-screen movie star, all of the other elements that made the first one so enjoyable are gone. Director Tony Scott seems to be absolutely clueless about what made the first one so popular and fresh -- in other words, the comedy -- and instead focuses on aggressive violence and action.The song ""Shakedown"" was nominated for an Academy Award, but otherwise the film doesn't even boast as good a soundtrack as the original.Grade: D",Beverly Hills Cop II
16,Uriah43,Suffers in Comparison to Its Predecessor,5,21 September 2016,"After his friend ""Andrew Bogomil"" (Ronny Cox) is shot and critically injured in the line-of-duty in Beverly Hills, Detroit detective ""Axle Foley"" (Eddie Murphy) rushes to Los Angeles to help out in the investigation. Naturally, since he is out of his jurisdiction and has no authority to investigate this case he has to proceed under false pretenses and to do that he needs his friends ""John Taggert"" (John Ashton) and ""Billy Rosewood"" (Judge Reinhold) who happen to be Beverly Hills cops but also happen to be in deep trouble with their boss even before Axle's unexpected arrival. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, while this isn't necessarily a bad film, it suffers in comparison to its predecessor as a certain percentage of the comedy was simply recycled from the original movie. Likewise, there were some scenes which were unnecessarily vulgar as well. But again, it still managed to be fairly entertaining all things considered and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Beverly Hills Cop II
17,AaronCapenBanner,Inevitable Sequel.,4,4 September 2013,"Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, and John Ashton return for this sequel to the surprise box-office smash, which finds Axel Foley returning to Beverly Hills to investigate a series of high-tech robberies, involving a beautiful woman(Brigitte Nielsen) and her gang. The expected wise-cracks and explosions follow.Film is hated by some critics, but is really a minor step down from the first. Axel is portrayed the same way here as in the first, only a little more so. Again, Foley succeeds because everyone else is so dumb, and the plot, while slick, is also convoluted, but hardly the point of the film, being just a showcase for Murphy's wise-guy persona, which once again wears thin.",Beverly Hills Cop II
18,FlashCallahan,F*** Rambo.......,7,20 March 2014,"The original was one of the biggest films of 1984, and Simpson and Bruckheimer had a massive hit the year before with Scott's Top Gun, so this was fool proof, and only an idiot wouldn't green light the sequel, so it's more of the same, but bigger in every sense, but it's lost a little bit of the first films soul.Ronny Cox only comes back for a cameo, so he gets shot at the beginning, and this prompts Foley to return to Beverly Hills. He re-teams with Taggart and Rosewood, who isn't as timid as he was in the first film, and has a penchant for weapons, because this would make his character funnier, right?Obviously there is a sub plot involving gun running, Jurgen Prochnow, Bridgitte Nielsen and alphabets, so it's down to Foley to wisecrack his way to solving the crimes.This film could have just been Murphy running along the beach, swearing every few minutes and laughing, and it still would have been a huge hit, because every once in a while, the planets align, and Hollywood could make a critic and crowd proof movie.This was in instance of that. Scott was huge, he made Cruise a star. Simpson and Bruckhiemer did the same, Murphy was the biggest thing in Hollywood, and the original was massive.Nothing could go wrong.It's not brilliant by any means, in fact, sometimes the film seems downright lazy, more or less copying set pieces from the original, like the final act and the set piece where Foley pretends to be someone else in order to gain access to somewhere.But its flashy, sometimes funny, and it's always sunny in Beverly Hills, and you cannot help but love the infectious laugh.You realise after an hour just how bland it is compared to the original, but you'll enjoy it never the less.",Beverly Hills Cop II
19,Aaron1375,I enjoyed this Beverly Hills Cop the best.,8,8 March 2011,"I know this goes against the grain, but I did enjoy this sequel to Beverly Hills Cop more than the original. I was not the biggest fan of the first film, it had its moments, but I did really enjoy this one. This one has Foley returning to Beverly Hills to help the friends he made from the first film solve a set of robberies and a cop getting shot. I do not know, but I enjoyed the story more and I also enjoyed the inclusion of Brigitte Nielsen as the bad guy for the piece. She was rather good for a short stretch, but faded quite fast like a lot of actresses. I enjoyed the chemistry between Murphy, Reinhold and Ashton my favorite scene where Axel (Murphy) and Taggart (Ashton) were discussing Billy (Reinhold) possibly having a problem as he had quite an assortment of weapons and gun paraphernalia. The action in this one is really good too and I like the humor a bit more here too. To me it is a better film, but that is me. Most people like the first one better I imagine, I just thought this one had a bit more substance to it than the first film. I think this one is a wild ride and the cast is comfortable with their roles. I am sure we can all agree that it is a better sequel than the third movie.",Beverly Hills Cop II
20,The_Void,Decent enough 'fun' flick,7,22 November 2005,"The original Beverley Hills Cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made. This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?) will probably have a good time with this sequel too. All the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again, with Eddie Murphy heading a capable ensemble cast, lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences. The plot is, as you would expect, superfluous to the style of the film; and much of the movie is simply tailored around it; but anyway, it follows maverick copper Axel Foley and his two California police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the 'alphabet murders', which involves a robbery, a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner.I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film. While they were still over the top, they were at least sort of believable. Here, however, Murphy goes massively over the top, and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw. Anyway, Murphy obviously enjoys himself; and if you can get by the complete lack of logic, you probably will too. True to style, the action is completely over the top too; with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is. The film lacks any kind of themes or substance, meaning that it will both not please serious film fans, and that this reviewer is running out of steam; but I will say that this movie does have a point to make, and that is simply entertaining it's audience. It may be completely silly, illogical fun; but some movies need to be there just to entertain, and this is one of those. I wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists, or going into with huge expectations; but it's a good time, that's for sure.",Beverly Hills Cop II
21,SimonJack,Over the top crashing and smashing highlight this sequel,5,16 February 2021,"This sequel to the 1984 movie has Detroit police detective Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) sneaking off to California in search of his friend's killer. Avenging a murder is just the first formulaic aspect of ""Beverly Hills Cop II."" In watching this film again these many years later, I now had many films of this sort of fast action, crime thriller, mayhem under my belt. And this one is formulaic all the way. The head villain is a rich, prominent, civic-minded person. That's a front for someone who is really a high-class mass murderer, drug and guns runner, or something of that sort. Another formulaic element is a big-mouth, blow-hard, publicity-hound, nasty police chief. Here it's Harold Lutz of the Beverly Hills police force. Allen Garfield plays the chief over-the-top mean.Then, toss in some heavy crunching scenes of car smashing and accidents, and the standard imprint of this genre of films of the late 20th and early 21st century is complete. Oh, yes, and lots of glass smashing of jewelry display cases and such. One questionable standout aspect of this film might be the very long smash-up scenario when Det. Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), with Axel onboard, drives a cement mixer truck that smashes, crunches, crumples and obliterates dozens of other vehicles, including a number of police cars. Maybe they were trying to set a record, but the vehicular destruction in this film alone had to make up a big chunk of the film's budget.Besides the noticeable increase in violence, this one also ramps up the profanity and crassness. Murphy had a hand in writing the screenplay for this film, and while one of the original writers was on board, Paramount must have thought it needed more violence to sell to the public. Well, Eddie Murphy was very popular by then, and his comedy talent boosted this film to the top in 1987. It wasn't a year for very good movies, let along any great ones. It made lots of money then, but these many years later this sequel can't match the original film. And it's still not for kids - or immature adults, for that matter.",Beverly Hills Cop II
22,Mr-Fusion,MTV flash and sizzle,6,28 August 2012,"It's nothing heartbreaking, but ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" is a shallow follow-up to one of the really great '80s movies. What worked in the original - a finely tuned script and great characters - has been traded in for high gloss and ""Top Gun"" lighting. In '84, Edie Murphy was a dedicated cop who ran his mouth to get the job done. Here, he's all about the jive; and man, does that get old.A lot of the incidental music is very nice (Faltermeyer can really score a bank robbery), and the ending shootout is pretty good. But the road thereto isn't all that fun.It's not a great movie, but some of that music is really catchy.6/10",Beverly Hills Cop II
23,StevePulaski,Both Axel Foley and Eddie Murphy deserve more than Beverly Hills Cop II can offer them,6,26 June 2014,"If there were ever a sequel to almost, almost succeed entirely on the charisma and charm of its lead actor, it would be Beverly Hills Cop II, the sequel to the unexpected action-comedy surprise of 1984 that skyrocketed at the box office and made actor Eddie Murphy a high-profile name. It also helped kickstart the career of Martin Brest, a highly underrated director who went on to do films like Meet Joe Black and Midnight Run. The film helped the careers of several involved, and the main problem with the sequel is that it operates as if its predecessor never existed in the strangest possible way.Before elaborating on that, Murphy reprises his role as Detroit police detective Axel Foley, who teams up once again with Beverly Hills detectives Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) to stop a gun-smuggling gang after the department's captain is shot and seriously wounded. Of course, when working with Axel, it's never a dull day, as Axel uses his wiseguy attitude, motormouth tendencies, and exaggerated emotions to further himself in the Beverly Hills life, which he learned in the last film, is much different than the kind of ""street operations"" that are conducted in Detroit.The issue at hand here is that Beverly Hills Cop II, despite undergoing a change in writers and a change in director, simply feels like it's trying to replicate success rather than trying something different with the formula. Even with the visual artist and the dazzling-effects manager of Tony Scott in the director's chair, providing Beverly Hills Cop II with a distinct look and hue in the visual department, the film never feels like it wants to take any chances or provide us with some daring, more elaborate instances that would make it standout rather than seem almost like a remake of its predecessor.The person to thank for not making this feature as glaringly obtrusive as it could've been is definitely Eddie Murphy, who simply doesn't change and doesn't need to. Murphy has such a zippy and energetic comedic flow and talent that his abilities translate beautifully to a sequel, as he winds up giving probably one of the strongest comedic performances in comedy history in the last two films. Murphy's hilarity is only heightened when Larry Ferguson (writer for The Hunt for Red October) and Warren Skaaren (writer for the original Batman and Beetlejuice) create a scene that he can steal without almost any effort, commanding the entire set with his trademarks and his energy. With those scenes, Murphy becomes an unmatchable force of comedic wit.It's a shame the film surrounding Murphy isn't as good as Murphy himself. Outside of its core performance and immersing visual style, Beverly Hills Cop II lays dormant as it is overtaken by a cookie-cutter, forgettable plot and a setup that feels too close to the original to succeed just as well as it did the first time around. Axel Foley is a memorable comic character and Murphy is an amazing comic spirit; both persons deserve more than Beverly Hills Cop II can offer them in a grander term.Starring: Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronny Cox. Directed by: Tony Scott.",Beverly Hills Cop II

After watching this, I was very glad that I bought it. It was great to see our favorite Beverly Hills cop back in action! Eddie Murphy is just so great and hilarious, he can make Charles Manson laugh! Basically, Axel has heard of some horrible crimes going on in Beverly Hills once again, so he comes back to help out the force. With his two favorite cops, Billy and John, only this time, they're a little more gutsy. Now they are after the alphabet crimes, a group of thieves led by the 7 foot tall Bridget Neilson. But it's going to be hard with the chief of Beverly Hills always getting on the trio's butts.I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy. Who could resist that great chuckle of his? Beverly Hills Cop 2 is filled with just as many laughs as the first one and I don't see how anyone could not laugh at least a few times.7/10",Beverly Hills Cop II
25,OllieSuave-007,Great Beverly Hills Cop sequel!,9,27 January 2014,"The first sequel to what I think is one of the best action comedies from Hollywood. Eddie Murphy returns as Detroit cop Axel Foley, who goes to Beverly Hills to investigate who gunned down Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox). He reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Det. Sgt. John Taggert (John Ashton) to catch the perpetrator, and to nab those behind of string of robberies plaguing the city, while also dealing with the department's new, arrogant and obnoxious Chief Lutz (Allen Garfield).Like the first film, this sequel has a no-nonsense and compelling story with exciting action sequences that make this movie a definite must-see for action movie fans. In addition, humor is in abundance, especially when in scenes where Murphy, Reinhold and Ashton are together. I like the fact that their on-screen chemistry and them working together are emphasized more in this film.Murphy's quick wit and action, Reinhold's cool and observant demeanor and Ashton's serious and commanding character gave us another one of the best movie trios ever assembled. The villains were also noteworthy: the sly, calm, yet cold Maxwell Dent (Jürgen Prochnow) and the tall, beautiful, Femme Fatale Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen) were entertaining to watch on screen.Aside from a few minor issues I had with the film like the lesser action and the overzealous party goers at the Playboy Mansion scene, this is an enjoyable movie and is one of my favorite movie sequels.Grade A",Beverly Hills Cop II

27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"This time, it's personal... again.",6,1 February 2021,"'Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)' is basically the same movie as its predecessor, except it certainly isn't as good. This is primarily because, despite it strong returning cast, the picture just doesn't feel as though it's supposed to be a comedy; it's more like a straight action flick with some humorous elements. As soon as it starts, it's clearly a Tony Scott affair. That isn't a bad thing, but the prolific director's style doesn't quite mesh with the franchise's fast-talking, 'fish out of water' vibe. The picture's story is pretty confusing and generally unsatisfying, too. Still, Murphy - alongside Ashton and Reinhold - is good enough to carry the piece. It's a decent cop movie with a charismatic cast, some successful comedy and a few energetic set-pieces. 6/10",Beverly Hills Cop II

I think this is somewhat of a letdown from the first movie because I believe Eddie Murphy's charm on the audience wore off the second time around. I thought he did really well though.Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills and reteams with Taggert and Rosewood after a near fatal shooting to solve the so-called Alphabet crimes that has the wonderful California city in disarray.I already gave my opinions of Eddie Murphy above. If you're a fan of his, you'll like this. If not, well you won't. I thought the chemistry between Taggert and Rosewood is still there. It seems like how Rosewood is trying to impersonate an action star like Stallone or Eastwood.Tony Scott, the director of the awesome Top Gun came through here. He adds a great balanced mixture of action and comedy. There is also another rave soundtrack of great 80's tunes to listen to.Overall, this is a great action movie but not as good as the first.

30,CuriosityKilledShawn,There's gotta be a better way,7,6 August 2000,"Long ago, when Eddie Murphy was the biggest star in Hollywood, Beverly Hills Cop 2 was the most anticipated film of 1987. Movies like Trading Places and 48 Hours made Murphy famous. But Axel Foley made him a superstar. Impressed by Top Gun (even though it's a truly awful film), Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer brought Tony Scott on board to direct. What they forgot to do was polish the script.Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help solve 'The Alphabet Crimes' after his old pal Lt. Bogomil is gunned down in the street. With Taggart and Rosewood in tow (now actually doing police work instead of standing by) Axel uncovers a seriously convoluted conspiracy.The story should have taken a back seat to allow Murphy to work over the massive holes in the plot with his distracting wisecracks. I won't lie to you, there are some utterly horrible contrivances in BHC2 (Bogomil's daughter digging up dirt at the insurance company she just happens to work at is honestly the most obnoxious movie coincidence of all time), but you'll just have to suffer them.This might have been easy to overlook, but Tony Scott, still finding his feet as a director, and his editors turn a great deal of the film into an incomprehensible mess. Some of the continuity errors are just baffling (where did Rosewood get the coffee cup from at the night club crash scene?) and it makes the action quite hard to follow.However, Tony Scott's highly visual style of filmmaking is far more suiting to this kind of environment. The wealth and decadence of late 80s California is all over this movie, and it's the only aspect where it improves on the original. I doubt the latter day Scott would make the movie this way, but it's definitely the best looking of the trilogy. It's also the only one to be shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio (however it's Super35 instead of the superior anamorphic Panavision format).",Beverly Hills Cop II

32,Anonymous_Maxine,Axel Foley gets the Tony Scott/Jerry Bruckheimer/Don Simpson treatment,7,15 April 2009,"At the time of its release Beverly Hills Cop was the highest grossing comedy of all time, so it works out perfectly that its first sequel would be directed and produced by the juggernaut Hollywood crowd-pleasers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (and directed by none less than Tony Scott). The formula is exactly the same (and man I really mean exactly), although it follows all of the usual rules of an action sequel, which state that it must have a much bigger budget (Axel still does his police work by his own rules, only this time he uses precinct money to drive around in a Ferrari), more deaths, faster and funnier jokes (it clearly shoots for this one, anyway), and at least one more 6-foot platinum blonde. Let's take a little trip, shall we? Beverly Hills Cop 2 was released in May of 1987, and so came just after things like Top Gun, Police Academy 3, The Color of Money, To Live and Die in L.A. (which was sort of an anti-buddy cop movie with a mean streak that is clearly reflected in Cop 2), Eddie Murphy's own The Golden Child, and the original Lethal Weapon, which was released just a few months earlier and may have been sharing theaters with it. Needless to say, there was no shortage of police movies and whatnot, and no time is wasted in attempting to stand out from the crowd.The movie starts with a violent robbery pulled off in broad daylight by a highly organized group of criminals headed by the statuesque Bridgette Nielsen, who plays the curiously named Karla Fry. She's involved with a ruthless organized crime syndicate that is running firearms to Central America, and when police chief Bogomil is gunned down, Foley decides he's going to head on back to southern California to solve the case himself again. Everyone is friends now after the events of the first movie. Taggart and Rosewood are no longer spying on Axel but have all become good friends, as they have with Bogomil, who sided with them against the Commissioner or Chief or Mayor or whatever at the end of the last movie. Unfortunately, the new police chief is a total jerkoff and has been firing everyone in sight and replacing them with all of his own people, so once again Taggart and Rosewood and Foley are forced to go against direct orders in order to do what needs to be done.The movie has been almost unanimously slammed by critics, and I would certainly hesitate to say that it's as bad as all that. In more recent years I have not always been the biggest fans of people like Jerry Bruckeimer (the mega-producer who we have to thank for such highly polished cheesefests as Armageddon and Gone in 60 Seconds and Pearl Harbor, not that he hasn't had his better movies), but if you are just looking for a fun popcorn action flick, you could certainly do worse than this one.If nothing else, it was great fun picking out the hilarious 80s pop culture references, some of which were light-hearted jabs at the competition, such as the posters for First Blood Part II and Rambo in Rosewood's ""stress-free"" apartment, and maybe my favorite, Bridgette Nielsen's (Stallone's wife at the time) earrings, which were these bizarre little metallic arrows that made her look like a Klingon. It's true that some of the jokes and situations are a little too unoriginal, even only in the first sequel, such as Foley's remarkable ability to come up with crazy stories on the spot (although the best one is where he pretends to be a gay prostitute to get into a ritzy club and harass the bad guy) and his loud-mouthed streams profanity. But again, not necessarily something that I would criticize the movie for just for being there. It gets a little cheesy at times though, like when he gets into the bad guys' office by pretending to be a delivery boy delivering highly unstable plutonium capsules in - get this - a brown paper bag, but overall it stays in the same vein as the original and may even be better in a lot of ways.",Beverly Hills Cop II

Both Taggert and Rosewood(John Ashton & Judge Reinhold) work together to bring the criminals to justice. I like the music selections the movie made: ""Shakedown"" by Bob Seger, ""Cross My Broken Heart"" by The Jets, ""I Want Your Sex"" by George Michael, etc. Everything in the movie turned out great. Using the Mack R-Series Mixer as a ""decoy"" vehicle really did the trick on thwarting a robbery. Brigette Nielsen really hit it off after ""Cobra"", she was a very intimidating character in the movie. A little more exciting than the first, although I prefer Part one for the music score.

First we have Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) the fast talking Detroit cop, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Aston) the Beverly Hills cops, Capt. (He got a promotion) Bogomil (Ronny Cox) and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill) the real life cop who plays Axel's commanding officer. Paul Reiser who had a small part in the first film is elevated to Axel's Detroit partner in this one.A gang referred to as the Alphabet killers starts off by robbing a high end Jewelry store led by a cold blooded statuesque blond named Karla Fry (Brigitte Neilsen) who doesn't hesitate to gun down anyone who gets in her way. Capt. Bogomil had been investigating the gang so they make him next on the list. He is gunned down in broad daylight by a hit man and the aforementioned Karla. Badly wounded, he is taken to the hospital where he spends most of the rest of the movie.Axel Foley upon hearing the news, wangles his way back to Beverly Hills by conning his Commanding officer into believing he is closing in on a phony Credit Card scheme and needs to disappear for a few days. Back in Beverly Hills, Axel again hooks up with his old pals Rosewood and Taggart who have run afoul of their new Chief of Police (Allen Garfield), Axel cons his way (i.e. talks his way) into living in a a palatial mansion while the owners are away.Axel finds a rare type of shell casing at Bogomil's crime scene and traces it back to a gun club run by Chip Cain (Dean Stockwell) who is fronting the operation for magnate Maxwell Dent (Jurgen Prochnow). He also discovers Karla there as well and begins to suspect them as being involved in the Alphabet crimes.The gang next targets the City Depository where banks transfer their funds. During the robbery, Karla murders Cain setting him up as the head of the gang. Axel and the boys foil the robbery. Billy commandeers a cement truck and careens through the streets wrecking cars at every turn in pursuit of the bandits.

The old stand by, the chase through the streets (this time with a cement truck) is alive and well. Watch for a young Chris Rock as a parking lot attendant and Hugh Hefner and his main squeeze at the time, Carrie Leigh in small roles.And as well, we get to see poster of Sylvester Stallone movies in Billy's plant filled apartment. Stallone is also mentioned by Taggart after Billy fires the bazooka.

37,elshikh4,"""The Heat's Back On"".. But Not Hot !",5,29 March 2009,"A kind of fair time, but not a fair movie. It's moderately entertaining, with nothing great to present along the way.First of all, the plot seemed outwardly hot, but wasn't that sensible always. There are sleazy details such as the matter of matchsticks handed by killer to another, for nothing but being found later in the murder scene! I hated some of Axel Foley's features in here, like giving him some of MacGyver's capacities. The comedy was whether weak; some of the lines were pathetic, or forced; actually Murphy's character doesn't need this whole explosives' scheme to go into the club. The dialogue is extraordinarily boring according to the fact that we're in an action movie, directed by Tony Scott too! Let alone the reiteration of the first movie's curriculum; with the superfluous strip club scene, the end's speech for the unhelpful police chief.. etc. without any original points for this sequel. Maybe Brigitte Nielsen's character was the only genuine touch in a role that used to be given to brawny men instead.The casting is mostly so provocative; whereas Dean Stockwell looked like a house husband more than a professional hit-man. John Ashton is a problem, having a strange charisma that makes him not comic enough, or attractively serious one in unserious situations. Although Brigitte Nielsen was tough and distinct, but actually Judge Reinhold was the most appealing this round as a character and performance. True that Murphy was radiant and sprightly, but without much to offer, wasted by a script that made him move without a catch. Simply the persona of funny Dirty Harry, that was brilliantly established in Beverly Hills Cop three years earlier, transformed into idiot cartoon which wasn't forceful or droll. And yes, his rubbery laugh irritated me to the max, especially when he repeats it dully more than once as a mark from the first movie!I don't think that it got huge budget; the movie says that about itself. The action wasn't impressive at all; only a car chase that got my attention. It's clear that Tony Scott wasn't having fun doing this, executing more than creating.As a whole, nothing is new, hot or funny, looking like any average B-movie, however with big name and few artfully colorful images. Compared to Beverly Hills Cop I and III, definitely it's the weakest installment. It's another Hollywood hamburger, that wasn't tasty or spicy.",Beverly Hills Cop II

So Axel reunites with old buddies Billy Rosewood(Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart(John Ashton) to go and solve the crime.Being that this is the second film in the trilogy, one would expect ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" to either be a step up or a step down from the first film. ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" tries to be stylish but can't even though it's in the hands of Tony Scott, director of 1986's ""Top Gun"".  The action here is a lot wilder too, but after a while it starts to get pointless, especially in the ending shoot-out.

40,jimbo-53-186511,The critics have been a bit harsh on this film,7,15 July 2020,"When Lieutenant Bogomil (Ronny Cox) is gunned down in broad daylight by a mysterious assassin detectives Rosewood and Taggart set to work in trying to find out who was behind the shooting. Upon hearing of the news, Detroit police officer Axel Foley once again reunites with Taggart and Rosewood and assists with their investigations much to the dismay of the chief of police Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield)...Critically, the first Beverley Hills Cop film was a success and has remained a popular film even 30 + years later and having seen it recently I can see why as it had a winning combination of Eddie Murphy at the top of his game and good straight-man support from Reinhold and Ashton plus a serviceable story.What surprised me is that the second film offers all of the same things yet it never seems to get held in the same kind of light at this first film; perhaps the reason is that many purists have the belief that familiarity breeds contempt, but for me sometimes a bit of what you know can be a good thing.I have to concede that there were parts in the early stages of the film that I found to be a little overbearing; we know that Beverly Hills Cop and Murphy are both loud, but for about the first 20-30 minutes it was literally too much at times - I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy's, but some of his early scenes were a little too loud and shouty and at times some of these moments came across as irritating. Thankfully things improve and settle down when he makes the trip to Beverly Hills which was a relief as I don't think my lugholes could have endure the loudness much longer.Once the investigation begins it does become enjoyable and I have to admit that Axel's ingenuity in getting information from people (whether directly or indirectly) holds no bounds and is always fun to watch. Reinhold and Ashton are great once again in supporting roles and Gil Hill was always a good character who sadly only had a small role in this film.Sadly what does let the film down slightly is Brigitte Nielsen who has never been much of an actress and basically recites her lines as though she's reading them from an autocue and I'm sorry but I never found her that 'sexy' either. Isn't it also interesting that Rosewood had posters of Rambo and Cobra in his house (2 Stallone films) all at the time when Stallone was married to Brigitte Nielsen and she had an affair with Tony Scott. I suspect Nielsen only got the role based on these factors making her appearance all the more uncomfortable and out of place for those who know too much. Prochnow fares better and at least manages to bring a little menace, but Stockwell is weak. Look out for a cameo from Chris Rock at an early point in his career and a more obvious cameo from the late Hugh Hefner.Still despite some off-set issues at least Tony Scott does a relatively good job on-set by providing the audience with plenty of spectacle and some solid action sequences. In my opinion this is every bit as good as the original film and I am a little bit perplexed as to why it seems to be looked upon less favourably than the original film. Simply put if you liked the first film then you'll enjoy this sequel.",Beverly Hills Cop II

Also, Eddie Murphy tried too hard to be funny or decisive, at times even shouting his lines in a not at all believable manner.The matter is that shouting by itself is not most important, what's important is that when someone shouts, he has to develop a menacing aura around himself for the loud voice to take effect and in those scenes, all we felt and heard were loud voices, artificial behavior and nothing menacing whatsoever. That's why it didn't work. Remember the warehouse tremor in the first movie, he succeeded not due to the amplitude of his voice, but because of the menacing effect that his speech carried around, making the guys fear for consequences.Overall, a well above-average movie with an entertaining screenplay, good acting of course, a semi-strong middle flow and a sort of a weak ending.",Beverly Hills Cop II

Oh and it also has the added bonus of featuring the Playboy Mansion too.It suits Eddie Murphy perfectly, given that his stage persona is all about being the coolest, biggest personality in the room. Although it presents as a 'fish out of water' story, BHC2 is actually more like the tale of a virus entering a new population that has no immunity to it. Nobody can defend against the motor mouth of Axel, Murphy's character. I sometimes wished someone did in fact, just once, so that he could get out of the situation some other way, but he talked his way out of or into everything perfectly, without fail. It's an enjoyable romp, with a central trio whose friendship I believed in. Scott's fingerprint is visible in the thrilling car chase sequences and (literally) explosive shoot-outs. There's not much depth to it, but you can get that elsewhere, like in the work of Tony Scott's older brother Ridley.

46,eric262003,Comedy Failed Due To Forced Attempts To Provide Laughter,5,9 September 2013,"The sequel to the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise is quite flashy and the action scenes are overall very gripping with a plethora of rapid camera cuts. The atmosphere surrounding this movie is loud and very vocal. Sure the excitement of this movie is great for those who love watching movies that are run in the fast lane. Sadly, the movie loses a lot of credibility in terms of quality that's greatly absent in this picture. I think the movie overly attempts to top the success of its predecessor, but somehow ultimately fails. Unlike the first ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movie, the sequel lacks that comical charm and panache that made the first film a success. For greater portions of this movie, the comedy feels forced and the execution becomes both pedestrian and repetitive. The continual usage of the word ""Shut Up!"" is horribly emphasized. It starts to become too cruel and tiresome and the humour just doesn't seem to feel that funny at all. It's like the audience does not have the freedom to decide on what should be funny. They expect the audience to laugh at every situations that's displayed in front of them. Some scenes tend to be over-cooked to have anything logical. The script pathetically yearns for us to just laugh off every scene, but in reality the gags exhibited have absolutely no point to it. What's so funny about humming to the theme of ""The Dating Game""? Also since when has misogyny have ever been funny? Way too many times the word ""bitch"" was badly utilized. Also is it all that necessary to use every descriptive synonym for certain parts of the human anatomy and to assume it is in any way shape or form hilarious? I mean the cruel intentions of this movie is bad enough I mean why add salt to the wounds? It's a very narrow- minded debacle that they assume that the more you inflict loud and verbal abuse towards everyone, then this movie is even deemed as funny? Well news flash for you, it's anything but funny, in fact it's both abusive and very juvenile. The story starts losing it sparks as it starts to become a bona-fide car chase and it's executed in a very ridiculous perspective. It's told in a very illogical premise and the crime capers scenario looks and feels redundant. And the most saddest part is that it takes itself way too seriously.

48,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"""Neolithic incompetence"" indeed",2,23 July 2013,"Superlame sequel has Detroit cop Murphy going back to Beverly Hills three years after the events of the first film to track down the person responsible for shooting Beverly Hills captain Bogamil, while he was investigating some ridiculous plot, melodramatically known from the first scene as ""The Alphabet Crimes"".Several overly convenient explanatory scenes were required in this ridiculously contrived and unfunny sequel, this has none of the charm or chemistry or spontaneity of the first film, replacing that with badly over-directed scenes of blazing red sunsets and dark glowing neon lighting.Murphy does the best as he can with the material, but John Ashton looks (understandably) bored with his now unnecessarily mean character; while Judge Reinhold's character was changed from a likable goofball from the first film, to gun-toting, wannabe Rambo in a trenchcoat in this film.The soundtrack, partially by Bob Seger, falls flat, especially compared to the first film's. Formulaically returns to another strip club, before a lame attempt at another ""SuperCop"" routine, as Axle poses as a psychic from St. Croix.Dirty Harry reference was funny, one of the few times I laughed, also during Gilbert Gottfried's and Robert Pastorelli's cameos. I also laughed a bit at Pastorelli's ridiculous pompadour hairdo. Gil Hill was merely going through the motions of being Axle's obligatory angry superior. Hugh Heffner's cameo is needless and out-of-place, and the dump truck demolition derby leading up to it is a lame attempt to top the smash up intro in the first film, and it put more people's lives in danger than the villain's plot did.And if Bogomil was so seriously injured from multiple gunshot wounds at the start of the film, why does he seem to get up and back to work in a few days?What a waste. Did this film's screenwriters even watch the first film?",Beverly Hills Cop II
49,oneguyrambling,I like it nearly as much as the first - so sue me.,6,3 February 2012,"After the original hit so big in 84 it was inevitable (and to a 14 year old like me) quite welcome that a sequel would be cobbled together. The surprising part of it all is that this film is almost as good as the first, and despite being panned mercilessly by many it remains one of my favourite guilty pleasures from the 80s. In fact I probably know this film better than the original.Axel Foley is once again drawn back to Beverly Hills from his cosy, dangerous rut in Detroit – much to his superior Detective Todd's chagrin. This time he is there to uncover just who is responsible for Lt Bogomil being gunned down there. (One photo of a fishing trip is enough to inform us that between the first and second film the Beverly Hills Police crew and Axel have become fast friends.) The mechanics of the sequel demand that it be more elaborate, so this time Axel, Taggert and Rosewood find themselves on the trail of the Alphabet criminals, so called for leaving clues in the form of letters and performing their crimes alphabetically – wonder how they would have gone if they made it to 'Q'? With the characters already introduced and by this stage well-defined, all that is left is to get into it. The sequel has a soundtrack that is almost as good as the original, action sequences that hurtle along almost as well, and better criminal big wigs in the form of Jurgen Prochnow and unfathomably tall and blond Bridget Neilson.It seems to me that the first two Beverly Hills Cop films were taken very seriously by the filmmakers, with no Martin Brest at the helm a savvy move was made to put Tony Scott behind the wheel, a man that can make reading the phone book more adrenalising and somehow exciting.The last 45 minutes of BHC2 is in fact almost one long unbroken action sequence, with chase scene after chase scene, most only broken up to pause while Axel breaks out another character voice to bluff his way into or out of trouble.The pacing of the sequel is probably better than the original, thanks again to the fact that Scott didn't need to bother us with character development, and the series of coincidences and fluke meetings that hold the plot together are forgivable given just how entertaining the rest of the film is.Final Rating – 8 / 10. OK it isn't all-time great and it relies on Murphy's charm to smooth over some dull spots, but this remains undeniably rewatchable and continues to amuse.",Beverly Hills Cop II
50,baumer,Wickedly funny,9,20 August 1999,"It never fails.  I remember seeing this film in the summer of 87.  I remember seeing it four times and twice I had to sit near the front of the theatre because it was packed.  The film went on the gross about $250 million dollars.  Audiences were laughing their guts out and returning for more.  So what happens to a film this funny that it only gets less than 6 on the IMDB?  Do people forget what it's like to laugh?  Do people forget how funny Axel Foley really is?  Has the boring and embarrassing third one destroyed all that was memorable about the first two?  Because Beverly Hills Cop II is nothing but a treat.  It is hilarious and as a movie itself it is pretty good too.  The characters have even had a chance to grow from the first film.  This is a really funny movie and if you haven't seen it in a while you should treat yourself and do so.Axel Foley goes back to Beverly Hills to investigate the shooting of his old buddy, captain Bogamel( Ronny Cox ).  Here he again teams up with his two pals Rosewood and Taggart.  But before he goes to Beverly Hills he has a good old fashioned ass chewing by inspector Todd.  Remember the famous scene? "" Two thousand dollars for a suit, two hundred dollars for a tie, a requisition order for a Ferrari. ""  And then "" I'm going deep deep deep, deep undercover. ""  We also have a small role for Paul Reiser as Jeffrey. So all the old characters do their thing at the beginning, but it's when we get to Beverly Hills that things get all messed up.  And one of the best surprises of this film is the character growth of Rosewood ( Judge Reinhold).  In the first one he was a shy, unassuming, wet behind the ears cop.  Now he seems as though he has watched too many Sylvester Stallone movies ( and this may be the case as we see a poster for Cobra and Rambo hanging in Billy's house ).  He now carries bigger weapons, talks with more confidence and wants to go on Foley's adventures.  His change provides the film with many of it's funnier moments.But of course what we expect out of Eddie Murphy in this role is a wise cracking, fast talking, spur of the moment character.  And that we get.  He does just as many little ""skits"" in BHC2 as the first and most of them are hilarious.  Especially funny is the one in the gun club when he supposedly brings in a bag of "" plutonium nitrate highly explosive soundseaking projectlies.""  The scene works because we really don't know what all that jargon is and neither does the lady behind the desk.  Murphy is the master of smart ass comedy.  He has an impeccable sense of comedic timing and he plays the crowd at the theater like a drum.  We are under his spell and we love it.  BHC2 is comedy at its finest and there is no reason for you not to enjoy this film unless you are just not a fan of Murphy.  There were few films in the 80's that Murphy failed in, this is not one of them.  True hilarity from beginning to end.",Beverly Hills Cop II

52,Mister-6,"Bad ""Cop""....",2,30 April 2000,"A fall from greatness is a sad thing to witness, and none is sadder than the fall witnessed in ""Beverly Hills Cop II"".Eddie Murphy is back as Axel Foley and you can have him.  He's back in Beverly Hills to find the truth behind the shooting of Capt. Bogomil (Ronny Cox).  This consists of him insulting and belittling nearly every single person who comes across his field of vision in a loud, shrill and usually un-funny way.  Even Dets. Taggart (Ashton) and Rosewood (Reinhold) don't get away unscathed, even as they work with Axel once more.Of course, the biggest joke in this movie is Eddie himself; he is so full of himself here and believes, even when he is being a jerk, he's in the right. It's amazing: in this single film alone, he takes bland pot shots at blue collar workers, receptionists, tall blonde women (Nielsen), German-accented bad guys (Prochnow), overbearing cops (Garfield, Hill, Reiser) weaselly little front men (Stockwell, looking suspiciously like his Dr. Yueh character from 1984's ""Dune""), Gerald Ford and Hugh Hefner!  Things are made worse when you realize that NO ONE could ever get away with the things Murphy does here.  Only in his little world he has created for himself. 
Nobody does themselves any favors by appearing in this movie.  And the cameos by people with talent (Reiser, Chris Rock, Gilbert Gottfried) are so short that you expect Murphy felt himself being up-staged and cut them himself.  Hey, it could happen.  And there is SO much misogyny running through this flick that you expect Gloria Steinem could use this whole film as an indictment against Hollywood in general.  And WIN.What a waste.  The only good scene is the obviously improvised scene where Murphy introduces himself as Johnny Wishbone from the Island of St. Croix. And that's about it. Not much for action fans here, either.Two stars.  One for the good will left over from the original and the fact that Sylvester Stallone, original choice for Axel Foley, didn't take this role.  Just imagine what HE would have done to ""Beverly Hills Cop II"".Of course, you could always watch ""Cobra""....",Beverly Hills Cop II
53,TOMASBBloodhound,Another sequel that ain't equal.,5,7 October 2013,"The Beverly Hills Cop franchise was in some ways like the Smokey and The Bandit series. They both had good original films, then each sequel was geometrically worse than the film before it. Beverly Hills Cop II had potential. Eddie Murphy was at the height of his career. The important co-stars were mostly back. Simpson and Bruckheimer were on board as producers. Tony Scott was a hot new director... but somehow it just doesn't quite gel. Maybe Scott was a bad choice. Think of how easily the original Beverly Hills Cop movie flowed between action and comedy. Martin Brest understood how to do this. Midnight Run was another fine example. But Scott didn't get this genre right until later on with films like The Last Boy Scout and True Romance. Good screenwriters also helped those efforts. But ""Cop II""?? Overall, its just too loud, fast and doesn't let either its stars or audience up for air. The villains are poorly cast and end up coming off as pretty generic. Murphy's reason for being out in L. A. is a bit more credible this time, but its poorly set up. Get this: Murphy is watching TV back in Detroit, and on the local news he hears about his police lieutenant buddy (Cox) getting shot in L. A.. Pretty slow news day in the Motor City, I guess. Detroit certainly has enough of its own shootings to cover on the news. Cox was only wounded, too! Couldn't they just have had his daughter call Murphy and that would be enough?? Once Murphy gets out to California, he meets up with old pals Ashton and Reinhold. The group shares some funny moments between numerous car chases and shootouts. But too often it seems like everyone is in a big damned hurry. Most of Murphy's dialog sounds completely ad-libbed, and the timing always seems off. He almost seems to be shouting in every scene just to make his character heard over all the set pieces and commotion. The plot involving ""the alphabet bandit"" is little more than arbitrary. And Hugh Heffner comes off as being the jerk he is. Not a great picture. But better than part III. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Beverly Hills Cop II
54,ivo-cobra8,My review of my all time favorite fun action flick Beverly Hills Cop II,10,4 October 2015,"Beverly Hills Cop II is definitely my all time favorite Action comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) will always be the best and my all time favorite film that I love to death. That is why I just love the sequel much more and I have always enjoyed this film much better than the original film I did. Here Axel Foley,Billy Rosewood and John Taggart works as a team than they did in the first film. This time Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart and Rosewood investigate Chief Bogomil's near-fatal shooting and the series of strange robberies ""alphabet crimes"" associated with it. Axel Foley comes back which he reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood and Detective Sergeant John Taggart.I love the Action sequences they are all great , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing. They are all great, there isn't any cgi in it. Whole cast did a great job. It is my all time favorite sequel to the first film. I seriously I love this film to death and I always have enjoyed so much. I still don't get it why all the hate for this film? The third film was really the worst in the series but I still like it and I will still watch it. Eddie Murphy did a great job as a Detroit detective Axel Foley, he did acted very well. Yes he was shouting one everyone I saw that, but there are things in the film that people didn't noticed. After his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil was shot he didn't hesitate to come to Beverly Hills and helping him out. He cared more about his friend than anyone else did. He hustle Maxwell Dent accountant Sidney Bernstein for $200 but, he later donated the money for Beverly Hills homeless people. He could spend the money but he donated. After he took Billy's vitamins and he bluff out the secretary in Beverly Hills Gun Club for money and he throw the vitamins away. he gave the money back to Billy for the vitamins he throw away! I thought that was very nice. Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood did a wonderful job and a support in the main cast along side Axel Foley. He was crazy with guns which I love it. We see poster from Stallone's Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part II in Billy's apartment. I love how he was driving the car and caring so much guns with him. He had a turtle in his apartment awesome. John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart did a pretty good job as detective helping and solving a Alphabet crime he was awesome. Brigitte Nielsen as Karla Fry did a wonderful job as villainies and it was one of her best roles I have ever seen. Jürgen Prochnow as Maxwell Dent was fantastic villain much better than Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks in the first movie did. Dean Stockwell as Charles ""Chip"" Cain did a fantastic job as Dent henchman. Allen Garfield as Chief Harold Lutz was fantastic he was so load and funny I was keep laughing at his performance. The Last and at least the best small role that had was Ronny Cox I seriously I love him in this film. He doesn't do much but his still a good as Andrew Bogomil we finally found out that he has a daughter Jan and she is very beautiful. There are other faces in this film like are Hugh Hefner who plays himself, Chris Rock has a small cameo in it.Gilbert Hill as Inspector G. Douglas Todd and Paul Reiser as Detective Jeffrey Friedman also return from the first film and they also do have a few scenes in the film.In the original movie they were only in the beginning of the film than they were cut off from the rest of the film. I seriously think Tony Scott did a wonderful job filming this decent awesome Action Comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by Tony Scott. It is the sequel to the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop and the second installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Although it made less money than the original Beverly Hills Cop and received mixed reviews from critics, the film was still a box office success, making $153,665,036 domestically.I love this film to death!!! I love this film to death! it will always stay in my heart! I love the shooting, action, car chases, playboy girls everything in this film. I love Eddie Murphy! I also love the main theme for Axel Foley from Harold Faltermeyer and songs a Better Way"" - James Ingram,Shakedown"" - Bob Seger and Hold On"" by Corey Hart.",Beverly Hills Cop II
55,gab-14712,A Brainless Sequel to a Classic!,7,10 November 2020,"In 1984, the world was treated to Beverly Hills Cop, a highly-energized action film that put Eddie Murphy on the map and it remains a classic to this day. Plus, it made a boatload of money. So, in the eyes of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, it made sense to make a sequel. While the film was financially successful despite making less than the first film (was the third highest-grossing film of 1987), Beverly Hills Cop II fails to live up to its predecessor's reputation. While there are some genuinely charming and amusing moments, the action is a bit brainless and Eddie Murphy comes across as more grating than funny. And some things within the plot does not make much sense. Like after the animosity shown between them in the first film, how are Axel Foley and Andrew Bogomil like best friends now? Not much of an explanation was given.
If you were to draw comparisons to the original film, this film is driven on its action sequences rather than plot or characterization. I believe one of the major reasons for that is the hiring of Tony Scott as director. Coming off the success of 1986's Top Gun, Bruckheimer thought Scott was the man for the job. He is not a bad director, but his films are more action-heavy and rely upon action sequences. They can be entertaining from time to time, but mostly are loud and brainless. It does not help that the script, written by Richard Tienken and Robert Wachs, met subpar standards. They were going to expand the film and film scenes in London and Paris, but Murphy expressed reluctance to film overseas. I thought that would have been a neat idea. But instead, we were treated to a rehash of the original, just a louder version of it.
Three years after the events of the original film, the street-smart, wisecracking detective from Detroit, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is back in town after he learns of an assassination attempt on Captain Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox). With that, Beverly Hills is in the midst of something called the ""Alphabet Crimes"" which is a series of smash-and-grab robberies. Detectives Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) are having a difficult time solving the case. They seemingly link the attempt with a suspect named Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen) who is an elusive hitwoman that may be part of an international arms smuggling ring. Can Axel Foley help his detective buddies solve the case?
Look, I am a big Eddie Murphy fan. His charisma and aptitude for brazen comedy is why the first film worked very well. Here, he was not used properly. His character came across as annoying and obnoxious. I will admit that his ""Johnny Wishbone"" sequence with the police chief, Harold Lutz (played by Allen Garfield) was hilarious. It was nice to seem him gang up with Reinhold and Ashton again. The three do have chemistry when working together. The villains, played by Nielsen and Jurgen Prochnow, were uninspired and forgettable.
Another important aspect to the film is the soundtrack. Harold Faltermeyer returns to compose the score and incorporates his famous ""Axel F"" theme often. The songs chosen are a mixed bag. Sadly, there is no Patti LaBelle to stir things up (nice pun, right?). Bob Seger does contribute with an Oscar-nominated song called ""Shakedown."" But on the other side of things, there is that controversial George Michael song that sadly I was not a big fan of.
Overall, Beverly Hills Cop II does not live up to the original film. It is a louder version of the original version. There are some fun (if not brainless) action sequences. The ending is pretty fun at least. Tony Scott does know his way around a camera and does a good job in capturing a more gritty look and feel to the movie. Murphy later stated that he felt the movie was the most successful mediocre movie ever made. I can agree with that statement. If you just seen the first film, which is a classic, you will not be missing out if you somehow avoided this film. It is not bad, just a brainless exercise.

But it could have been much better too. Again, Eddie Murphy is back as Detroit Detective Axel Foley who goes to Beverly Hills to solve the alphabet murders, again teamed up with Beverly Hills Detectives Billy Rosewood and John Taggart. Although the team-up is again funny, it has that been there done that feel and it doesn't help that this time around, the story is a bit darker and weaker.

57,Maziun,OK sequel,6,1 March 2013,"Tony Scott's (RIP) sequel to Martin Brest's 1984 classic doesn't try to add anything new , but sticks to the formula that worked so well the first time. In many ways this movie feels like a carbon copy of the original. Watch those two movies one by one and you will see the similarities ( for example - Axel's arrival to Beverly Hills). Even some jokes are copies from the first movie (""This isn't my locker - This isn't my office"").Unfortunately the movie lacks the freshness of the original. There are some moments when the heroes are having more fun than I. The movie really thinks it's more cool than it really is. The writers of this movie are different than the people who wrote the original. They are obviously trying to imitate the style of the original. Unfortunately many of the jokes come as forced.Thankfully , this movie has some good elements in it. Otherwise it would be just as bad as the third. The movie looks good - it's Tony Scott movie after all. Eddie Murphy is quite possibly even better here than in 1984. He's got so much energy in him. One of the best surprises of this film is the character growth of Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). He provides most of the laughs. In the first one he was a shy cop.Here he acts like a guy who has seen too many Sylvester Stallone movies. He lives in a ""stress free"" apartment , has a lot of big guns and Stallone is his idol (There are movie posters to ""Rambo 2"" and ""Cobra"" in his house). In the final of the movie Rosewood even dresses as Cobretti. It's a great inside joke considering that Stallone was original star for the ""Beverly Hills cop"".There are so many great cameos - Gilbert Gottfried,Chris Rock , Hugh Heffner and many sexy Playboy Playmates. Brigitte Nielsen gives here best role here as the sidekick of the main villain.She's a bad actress , but she's OK here.Jurgen Prochnow and Dean Stockwell are also OK as the villains. John Aston is back as Taggert and gives a fine performance.The soundtrack is weaker than in the first movie. Still there are some great songs here : Bob Seger - ""Shakedown"" (nominated for Oscar) , James Ingram - ""Better way"" and The Pointer Sisters - ""Be there"".""Beverly Hills cop 2"" is a fun popcorn action flick. You could certainly do worse than this one. Anyone who enjoyed the first one will probably enjoy this one too. There are some good jokes here too ("" Are you driving with your eyes open ?

I think they were better than those in Beverly Hills Cop. The plot is better. It's an action/comedy movie that came out in the eighties. It's one of the best action/comedy movies from that time. I think it was equally good as Beverly Hills Cop. Axel Foley has a bigger challenge now after he finds out that one of the cops has been wounded. Axel Foley is being asked to help his two fellow cops - Bill Rosewood and John Taggart - to solve the case. They also want to teach those bad guys a lesson, and show them who they're messing with. They are messing with cops, and some very good ones like Axel Foley. One of the coolest cops ever. They're a dangerous gang, and the cops can see that. One of the members happens to be a beautiful lady. She's bad who knows what she's doing. Axel Foley has a big challenge over his shoulders.

61,policy134,Scott shows how to make everything stylish but where is the substance,1,8 August 2005,"I was immensely disappointed when I saw this. After I had enjoyed most of the first Beverly Hills Cop movie I had high hopes for this one as well. To see Danish Brigitte Nielsen in a big budget movie was also some sort of weird attraction to me at the time and I thought that I could at least have some fun seeing some banter between her and Murphy, but the expectation was far more attractive than actually seeing it. They do share scenes but there are only lame suggestive remarks from Murphy and Nielsen's character is so devoid of humour that you have a nagging suspicion that she was only cast as some sort of deal with Stallone (Nielsen's hubby at the time), since he was to star in the first movie. There is a poster of his Cobra character, to further heighten the suspicion.The scenes mostly take place in smoke-filled rooms and you can hardly see any faces clearly. The main villain, played by Jürgen Prochnow, is such a anonymous character that you wonder why he even took the role. Was it because being in an Eddie Murphy film was so popular at the time that you just had to do it? The three Beverly Hills cops also reprise their roles here but the Lieutenant (now promoted to Captain) only has a couple of scenes and it is really totally unbelievable that Murphy's character and the Captain are discussing going on a fishing trip (could you even picture Murphy with a fishing rod?) So what we have is slam-bang action scenes with wisecracks that mostly fall flat and I almost forgot the totally annoying cameo by Gilbert Gottfried (one of Murphy's fellow SNL players) as an accountant named Sidney Bernstein. Take this as a warning: Expect extreme agony through most of the running time and please do not wait to go to the bathroom if you are watching at the same time, it is not worth the wait.",Beverly Hills Cop II

65,ethanbresnett,A damn good sequel to a classic comedy,7,8 June 2020,"Beverly Hills Cop is most definitely a classic, and I must say Beverly Hills Cop II lives up to the first one reasonably well. Everything that I enjoyed from the first one was carried on in this one, which is simultaneously a perk and a flaw. A perk because the style of the first was great, but a flaw because it did feel familiar in many respects. There is a little bit of a sense that if you've seen the first one, you've seen the second one. That being said this film is a hoot, and I can't wait to watch the third instalment.The plot is all a bit ludicrous and didn't entirely make sense (to me at any rate). There was nothing too original about the core concept, feeling a bit James Bondy in a way. It wasn't bad at all, and ticked along at a zippy pace, with a good variety of action sequences, comedic moments and sharply scripted scenes. The Beverly Hills Cop films aren't really about the plot though, its all about Eddie Murphy.He is just so god damn funny, and possibly at his comedic acting peak in the 80s. His comedic timing, body language, facial expressions are second to none, making Beverly Hills Cop II hilarious. I actually think the humour was as decent as the first film, its just the plot which doesn't match up in quality. There are several cast members returning from the first instalment, all of whom put in solid performances, but as mentioned its 100% Murphy's film.I also just love the style of 80s films, and Beverly Hills Cop II has so many 80s trademarks. From the soundtrack to the direction to the script. Its just a blast.Any fans of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise or Eddie Murphy in general will for sure love this film.

This felt like it was more plot-oriented, both when I was watching it, and now, when I've finished watching it. And that took me by surprise, which I think has taken a toll on me, writing this.The plot of the first movie was simpler, easier to understand, while the plot of this movie took a little more effort, and because I wasn't expecting the plot to not be as simple and easy to understand, the little more effort became even more. My brain is still processing everything and hasn't caught up to the here and now for focusing on what to write. But it's fine, it turned out fine.Moving on, the soundtrack was pretty excellent as well. That's probably the obvious conclusion, but still. I think I like the songs used just a tiny bit more than the songs used in the first one. While I potentially enjoyed it more than the first installment, the movie itself hasn't given me that inclination to give it the same rating that I gave the first installment, an eight. That's why I've gone with a seven, instead. I'm not sure what the cause of that is or could be, and it stumps me, as it is contradictory to the fact that I think I enjoyed this movie more than I did the first.Anyway, this was a solid second addition to this film series. I'm going to get right to watching the third. I'm a little anxious, though. The overall audience rating percentage of it is lower than the first two. That seems foreboding. I think it'll be fine, I just hope it doesn't tarnish what could've been for when I watch it had I not seen that the audience rating percentage for it was lower than for the first two films.",Beverly Hills Cop II
68,goya-4,second verse same as the first,5,1 September 2000,Beverly hills cop 2 is basically a rehash of the same old plot as the first... why mess with sucess right? well what you get is a lesser version of the first..the first was different new and an excellent movie with good acting..this is not.. while its not bad for a sequel..the plot..Murphy infiltrating arms smugglers and always being in the right place at the right time lends to its unbelievability but this is hollywood remember..it has good action in it but just not enough to recommend it..on a scale of 1 to 10 it gets a 5,Beverly Hills Cop II
69,jcbutthead86,"A Terrific,Hilarious,Action-Packed Sequel. Eddie Murphy And Tony Scott At Their Best.",10,10 June 2014,"Beverly Hills Cop II is a terrific,hilarious,Action-packed sequel that is filled with great direction,an great performance from Eddie Murphy and a wonderful cast,wonderful laughs,thrilling Action and a memorable score and soundtrack. And while Beverly Hills Cop II isn't a good as the original,it's an entertaining and worthy follow up.Beverly Hills Cop II once again finds wisecracking Detroit Cop Axel Foley(Eddie Murphy)back in Beverly Hills when his friend Andrew Bogomil(Ronny Cox)has been gunned down by an Alphabet bandit,a person who's been stealing money and jewelry. Back in Beverly Hills,Axel teams up once again with his buddies Billy Rosewood(Judge Reinhold)and John Taggart(John Ashton)to solve the case with more laughs and Action.After the huge and popular Box Office success of the classic Beverly Hills Cop in 1984,it seemed inevitable that a sequel was going to be made and three years later came the release of Beverly Hills Cop II,a fun and entertaining sequel that got mixed reviews from critics at the time and has divided Beverly Hills Cop fans for years where some people like it and others don't but the sequel was such a huge Box Office hit for Eddie Murphy making 153 million dollars and was one of the biggest hits of 1987 and is a sequel that mixes great laughs with explosive Action giving viewers a fun time for 102 minutes. What I like about Beverly Hills Cop II is that the movie basically takes what worked in the first film and rolls with it here giving viewers a movie that maybe just like the original but also giving viewers a good time that never slows down. Like the first Beverly Hills Cop this movie has a nice balance of Comedy and Action. The Comedy and laughs in BHC2 are funny,hilarious and will have you roaring with laughter whether it's scenes with Axel Foley with his wisecracks and Hijinks or the great scenes with Axel,Rosewood and Taggart working together and while the Comedic scenes are not as funny or iconic as the original they are still memorable and done with the same fun tone of the first one. If there is one thing that is bigger in this film it's the amazing and thrilling Action scenes and the Action in BHC2 is loud and intense and done in a fiery and fast pace style that was a trademark of director Tony Scott. One of the main criticisms on BHC2 is that the film focused more on Action than Comedy and I can say yes and no to that. Yes because the style of BHC2 is more like an Action movie with gunfights,explosions and chase sequences that were like the other Action movies of the 1980s and no because in certain scenes there is a mixture of intense Action and laughs to make sure that the movie isn't too serious. Of all of the BHC films the second film is probably the most stylish and visually stunning film in the series and that is thanks to not only Tony Scott's direction but also Jeffrey L. Kimball's photography because the city of Beverly Hills and even in Detroit there use of the different colors whether it's orange or blue either in the daytime or at night. The look of BHC2 captures the late 1980s very well. The character Axel Foley is hilarious in this on once again because like in the original Axel uses his smarts,wisecracks and wits to get what he wants and making fools out of any stranger whether he's pretending to be somebody else or stealing a house(you'll see). While Axel is still a Detroit Cop and a fish out of water,when he's in Beverly Hills the town is his playground and he's having fun with laughs and a smile the only way Axel Foley does. The ending of Beverly Hills Cop is great,memorable and is filled with laughs and Action that will satisfy viewers and leave them with a smile. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Eddie Murphy is excellent and hilarious once again as Axel Foley,with Murphy being funny and charismatic. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are terrific and funny once again as Billy Rosewood and John Taggart,Axel's friends and Beverly Hills Cops. Jurgen Prochnow is wonderful as villain Maxwell Dent,the man planning the Alphabet jobs. Ronny Cox is great once again as Andrew Bogomil,Billy and Taggart Captain. Bridget Nielsen is sexy and memorable as Karla,Dent's girlfriend. Allen Garfield is fantastic as Chief Lutz,a verbally abusive Police chief. Dean Stockwell is outstanding as Chip Cain,Maxwell's right hand man. Paul Reiser and Gill Hill are hilarious once again as Jeffrey Friedman and Inspector Todd,Detroit Cops. Robert Ridgely(Mayor Egan),Gilbert Gottfried(Sidney Bernstein),Tom Bower(Russ Fielding),Paul Guilfoyle(Nikos Thomopolis),Frank J. Pesce(Carlotta),Robert Pastorelli(Vinnie),Alice Adair(Jan Bogomil)and Brian O'Conner(Biddle)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for cameos by Hugh Hefner(Himself)and Chris Rock(Parking Vallet).The direction by Tony Scott is amazing and stylish,with Scott bringing a beautiful and stunning look to the film with good angles and camera movements. Great direction,Scott.The score by Harold Faltermeyer is outstanding and memorable once again and matches the film's tone. The soundtrack also includes songs by Bob Seger(Shakedown),George Michael(I Want Your Sex),James Ingram(Better Way),The Pointer Sisters(Be There),Keta Bell and Corey Hart(Hold On)and more. Terrific soundtrack.In final word,if you love Eddie Murphy,Tony Scott,Action-Comedies or the first Beverly Hills Cop,I highly suggest you see Beverly Hills Cop 2,a terrific and hilarious Action-packed sequel that is a worthy follow-up to the the original. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",Beverly Hills Cop II
70,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"OK, nothing more",5,17 June 2008,"The 1988 sequel to one of the most successful movies of all time finds Eddie Murphy reprising his role as Detroit police detective Axel Foley, and once again playing a fish out of water as he tries to solve a series of heists in Beverly Hills that may be connected to the attempted murder of his friend, a Beverly Hills police captain (Ronny Cox). Constructed in a much flashier and faster-paced visual style than the first film, the song still remains the same as Foley tries to keep his job in Detroit while solving crimes for the Beverly Hills cops. Murphy again makes the most of culture shock for comic effect, and the easy rapport between Murphy and Billy (Judge Reinhold), now a cheerfully over the top Rambo-esquire figure, is still the centerpiece of this series. While not the least bit original, director Tony Scott (Crimson Tide, Top Gun) puts his own stamp on this installment and keeps the action and the laughs coming",Beverly Hills Cop II
71,dk77dk,Beverly Hills Cop,7,2 May 2021,"A fun movie with fun characters from a time when movies tried to entertain the viewer.A film like this is almost impossible to make today, with entertaining characters, hilarious villains and a fun story that doesn't tire the viewer but gives him good entertainment. Eddie Murphy is fun, as always, and Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are just as great. Brigitte Nielsen and Jürgen Prochnow are great villains, a really fun combination.The soundtrack is great and completes the movie and makes it even more fun. The films of the eighties really have some special charm and can be watched over and over again. The film is well directed, the cast is excellent, and the soundtrack is absolutely great.A fun movie that is definitely worth watching.",Beverly Hills Cop II
72,monkeysgalore,What's With the Hate?,10,21 November 2018,"While there are many that like this movie, I've seen a lot of people who hate on it too, and I don't understand it. This movie was awesome. I think it's as good as, if not better than the first one. I mean, it delivers on every promise it makes, and it's especially good in comparison with the third film, so just take it for what it is and you'll have a fun time.Axel Foley returns as hip Detroit cop Axel Foley, and this time, he's drawn back to Beverly Hills in order to catch the person who shot Bogomil, and he re-teams with Taggart and Rosewood to do it, as well as solve the infamous ""Alphabet Crimes"".The film greatly benefits from Tony Scott's masterful direction, and he truly is a virtuoso when it comes to directing action films. I really love some of his other work, particularly his films with Denzel Washington (""Man on Fire"", ""Deja Vu"", ""The Taking of Pelham 123"", ""Unstoppable""), and he crafts some excellent action set-pieces here. While the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" films have never been accused of being action-heavy, what is here is quite good, particularly the final oil field shootout which was very memorable. I would even go as far as to say that Scott's direction here tops that of Martin Brest, who was responsible for the every bit as good original film.Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, known for their incredibly action-packed, often overblown action films filled with shootouts, chases, explosions, and fight scenes, are producing here, and it has their clear stamp on it, which is great, as they always put out fantastic action movies.As far as comedy goes, it's hilarious, and arguably funnier than the first. Eddie Murphy is just as funny here as in the last one, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments. The feel of the original is still there, and the ""fish out of water"" aspect of Axel in Beverly Hills is still present, even if it's not as apparent as in the original. His relationship with Taggart and Rosewood is explored further, and both get more background and screen time in this film.As I mentioned earlier, there's not a ton of action, even if some people do say this one's more action-packed than the first one. I'd say both have about the same amount, but even though there's not loads of action, what's here is great. A short shootout outside of a strip club, a cement truck chase, and the final, legendary shootout. Tony Scott really knows how to do action sequences, and his talent is definitely on display here.Everyone played their parts well, and the characters are just as likable here as in the first one. There's a lot of character development, probably more here than in the first, and there's a greater focus on Taggart and Rosewood, which I liked. A great script, excellent cast, and skilled director really made this film soar.A problem that a lot of people had with this one was that it was pretty much just a repeat of the first film, and that very little set this one apart. But honestly, isn't that the point of a sequel? I mean, yes, it would be nice to see a different film, but I don't agree that this is a repeat of the first one. The appeal of a sequel is that, if you liked the first one, then you'll like the sequel. It has the same characters, same plot elements, same actors, but a new situation. It takes everything that people liked about the first one, and adds more to it here. This sequel did have a different situation, although it still had the feel of the first one, which is one of the things that made it so good. But this sequel, instead of focusing on being something different, just decided to build on what made the original so good. It still had the 'average guy in rich Beverly Hills' vibe, it still had the same characters, same personalities, same location, but it developed these aspects more. There's now a greater focus on the lives of Taggart and Rosewood, as well as their relationship with Axel. There's a greater focus on Inspector Todd and the Detroit Police Department. There's more insight into the life of Bogomil. It is a rehash of the original, to a point, but there's more added. Everything that made the original a classic is still here, but there's now more of it. And I think this makes a good sequel. It worked with ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Lethal Weapon 2"". Different villains, same characters, same relationships, same action, same humor, different settings.Overall, this film is, at least to me, under-appreciated, and it does a lot of great things. If you've seen the first ""Beverly Hills Cop"", than you'll like this one. I mean, even the iconic theme and obligatory Pointer Sisters song are here. Watch it, and decide for yourself.",Beverly Hills Cop II
73,MovieFan983,Funny,7,23 January 1999,"It's pretty good. I thought Eddie Murphy as always made it great. Great jokes, plot, and action. 7 out of 10.",Beverly Hills Cop II
74,DeuceWild_77,"A great sequel on its own, more visually polished than the original and equally entertaining !!",9,22 December 2017,"Often criticized as a not-so-good sequel, it earned practically the same money at the B.O. than the classic first movie, which of course it's the best from the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise, no doubts about that, but the second one is still good in its own way.After the good job he made for the Simpson / Bruckheimer team in ""Top Gun"", Tony Scott was hired on the spot to helm ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"", with a bigger budget than the previous film & featuring almost the same cast & crew, but obviously, Scott added its own style to the film, way different than Martin Brest, which infuriated some of the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" purists.As a commercials and videoclips director, Scott was well-known for his flashy and glossy visual style, fast pacing, quick editing and over-the-top action, and that was the expected final product for ""BHC2"" and for sure, he delivered it even beyond expectations.It have more action than the first one, but the comedy situations (and timing) still dominate the screen and the higher budget is noticeable as much as the polished visual style of the whole, which was an improvement over the first.Eddie Murphy is back on his definitive role as Axel Foley, after the critical panned ""The Golden Child"", this time also as a co-writer and with him are back too: Judge Reinhold & John Ashton (the ""Laurel & Hardy"" of the Beverly Hills Police Department, both with more screen time and enhancing Murphy's acting and the general comedy tone of the movie), Gilbert R. Hill & Paul Reiser (as Inspector Todd and Jeffrey Friedman, respectively Foley's Chief & partner from Detroit, both hilarious), Frank Pesce (the cigarettes' smuggler from the first which appears as Robert Pastorelli's nephew, even if he looks older) & Ronny Cox (in an extended cameo role reprising Lt. Bogomil in a break of shooting ""Robocop""), together again for another ride.The new additions to the cast, performed it superbly, with the Berliner Jürgen Prochnow playing the eerie main villain, Maxwell Dent and the Danish Brigitte Nielsen playing his sexy bodyguard / henchwoman, Karla Fry in a clear homage to the James Bond's villains, especially the Christopher Walken / Grace Jones evil duo in ""A View to a Kill"", which was released 1 year before ""BHC2"" went to production. Eddie Murphy himself is a great fan of the James Bond movies, hence the ""Bond-ish"" villains presented here.Allen Garfield as the grumpy Chief Harold Lutz; Dean Stockwell as Carlos Cain; Paul Guilfoyle, from future ""C.S.I."" fame, as the arms' dealer Nikos Thomopolis; Gilbert Gottfried as Dent's accountant, Sidney Bernstein and a cameo from Hugh Hefner complete the main cast, which also features a ""blink and you'll miss it"" appearance of Coppola's regular supporting player, Glenn Withrow as Willie, one of Karla's henchmen.The major problem about this sequel it's the screenplay which wasn't as good as the original, it was a bit lazy developed and the movie works much better in the comedy and action sequences alone, than trying to making sense. 
So in the first movie, Axel and Lt. Bogomil said goodbye to each other in good terms, after Foley helped the L.A. Police to catch the drug dealer / smuggler Victor Maitland, but nothing suggests that they will became as close as being fishing together (the same for both Rosewood and Taggart), but after two years only they're all best buddies in the world, Axel knows his daughter and Bogomil's house and later in the movie, we see Axel entering Rosewood's place for the very first time. It was way more logical for Axel being closer to Rosewood, after the events of the first movie, than to Bogomil. The sudden ""Rosewood goes Rambo"" gimmick is an in-joke about Sly Stallone being the first choice for ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and the fact that Stallone's then wife, Brigitte Nielsen, was cast as the blonde bombshell, Karla Fry, in the movie and we can even glance a poster of ""Cobra"" starred by both Stallone & Nielsen and released a year before, when Axel is using the phone in Billy's room. This decision also upset some of the fans, but i find it harmless to the general plot.About ""The Alphabet Crimes"", that was a bit childish and corny decision to use as the villains' device, it looks a bit out of place in an 80's action flick, suiting more that campy Batman TV Show from the 60's, something the Joker or the Riddler could have done.A plot hole occurs when ""The Alphabet Crimes"" were called by that, when only Adriano's was robbed at the beginning of the movie, even before Bogomil was shot, so with only an envelope with an ""A"", the apparently incompetent Beverly Hills Police Department, led by Chief Lutz and his right hand, Biddle, they know that the city will have more crimes following the alphabet letters ? Johnny Wishbone, they're not...Besides all the plot problems, visually and technically, ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"" it's a competent directed, staged and photographed film, with lots of humour, fast paced action scenes that keeps the viewer totally entertained. 
The soundtrack is as good as the first one, with Bob Seger performing the main theme ""Shakedown"", written by Harold Faltermeyer (the composer behind the famous ""Axel F."" theme) & Keith Forsey, a song that became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.In short, it lacks the novelty and freshness of ""Beverly Hills Cop"", but it's still a very good sequel and an underrated film in the 80's cannon of action movies. Scott was always way ahead of its time and this movie was re-apreciated in later years as one of the first flicks that influenced the way action movies will be in the future... What is a shame is that there wasn't any action movie made in the last 20 years, that can even match what the late great Tony Scott did here...",Beverly Hills Cop II
75,no-skyline,Same again,6,5 May 2006,Beverly Hills Cop 2 is pretty much just the same as the original Beverly Hills Cop but without the freshness and originality of the 1st. Murphy is still a perfect Axel Foley and with some good supporting characters such as his foul mouthed chief of police and Detectives Rosewood and Taggart the movie does have it's moments but the rules of diminishing returns still apply.With a bit more originality in the script and a bit more daring this really could have been great. But for a sequel this isn't to bad just more of the same but not quite as good.6/10 - Not as good as the original but far superior to the tepid third instalment.,Beverly Hills Cop II

Everything that I enjoyed from the first one was carried on in this one, which is simultaneously a perk and a flaw. A perk because the style of the first was great, but a flaw because it did feel familiar in many respects. There is a little bit of a sense that if you've seen the first one, you've seen the second one.

78,phillafella,Disappointing Sequel to BHC.,5,7 June 2003,"This sequel to the smash hit movie BEVERLY HILLS COP takes the Murphy character back to Los Angeles to solve a case of `Alphabet' crimes. Unfortunately, BHC2 is another one of those ordinary sequels that got made just because its predecessor was such a huge hit, therefore lacking the quality of the original.  The major mistake of the movie comes from the storyline, which contains more bullets and not enough hilarity.  There are a few funny bits, though, such as John Ashton falling into a swimming pool and the scene where Murphy picks on Playboy ladies man Hugh Hefner, but the movie's good moments can't compete with lousy acting or a crummy script.2 out of 5",Beverly Hills Cop II
79,MovieLuvaMatt,Even better than the original!,7,19 May 2004,"Though I'm sure many disagree, I enjoyed the sequel even better than the original ""Beverly Hills Cop.""  Both are good movies, but this one has more laughs, in my opinion.  Eddie Murphy goes into more of his hilarious improvisations and since Tony Scott is in the director's chair this time around, the action scenes are more elaborate.  Taggart and Rosewood loosened up in the end of the original, so their characters are much more fun to watch.  I love Taggart's line at the end of the climactic shoot-out.  I still can't say John Ashton and Judge Reinhold match up to Laurel and Hardy, like Martin Brest (director of the original) said, but they do make a great team.  And as much as I loved the music in the first movie, the music in this soundtrack is even better!  The song during the opening title sequence, ""Shakedown,"" is perfect as it really got me pumped up for what was about to come.  Like the original, this movie also has a strip club sequence and as an added bonus, shots of scantily clad ""Playboy"" bunnies.  So how can I complain?  Well...other than the fact that Bronson Pinchot (who stole the show in the first and third movies as the hilarious Serge) doesn't make an appearance.  I still stand by my word in saying this is the best in the ""Cop"" series!  This is yet another reminder that Eddie Murphy used to make funny movies.  What happened to you, Eddie?  We want you back!

Beverly Hills Cop II is around the zenith of his power, and also that of director Tony Scott.Scott was just coming off Top Gun which, like it or not, is one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and thus incredibly influential. With these films, he practically set the template for 80s Hollywood: big, brash action scenes interspersed with big, brash... everything else.It suits Eddie Murphy perfectly, given that his stage persona is all about being the coolest, biggest personality in the room. Although it presents as a 'fish out of water' story, BHC2 is actually more like the tale of a virus entering a new population that has no immunity to it. Nobody can defend against the motor mouth of Axel, Murphy's character. I sometimes wished someone did in fact, just once, so that he could get out of the situation some other way, but he talked his way out of or into everything perfectly, without fail.It's an enjoyable romp, with a central trio whose friendship I believed in. Scott's fingerprint is visible in the thrilling car chase sequences and (literally) explosive shoot-outs. There's not much depth to it, but you can get that elsewhere, like in the work of Tony Scott's older brother Ridley. Tony (now sadly deceased) did stylish action thrillers, and he did them damn well.",Beverly Hills Cop II

In here, they flopped.Did they really had to make a sequel to an already good film? No. Is the film still about on the same level as the first? NO! This sequel feels like it abandons all the fun from the first. For example, Axel Foley isn't as fun as he was used to be, he seems more bored and unhappy in here, but the others feel still great as in the first.In this film, everything is done more seriously and personally. This is a huge mistake that shouldn't have happened, you can see that in the film.

The second installment has Axel Foley trying to solve a case involving a criminal who goes by the name ""The Alphabet Killer""(played by Jurgen Prochnow) after LT. Bogomil is shot by the Alphabet Killer's hench woman Sally, played by Brigitte Nielson. Later on Axel stumbles on a plot involving oil and a lot of guns. Beverly Hills Cop II is just as funny as the first one but is more visually pleasing. Whether it is the streets of Beverly Hills or an oil field out of town, the picture is sharp. Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold's character, Billy, provide most of the laughs. John Ashton's Taggert is okay on this one. Brigitte Nielson probably played her best role in here as The Alphabet Killer's partner in crime. The action scenes are pretty good but what made Beverly Hills Cop II interesting the most was the suspense. I mean Axel gets so involved in a case that he almost cost, Billy, Taggert and himself a job and he still succeeds. What a cop!

Here we even have ""sexy"" blonde bimbos going with a guy just because he has a red sports car and giggling like Marilyn Monroe while giving him the sexy eye constantly.And random shots of girls dancing topless on poles(looking like they'd rather be elsewhere). Here Eddie even called one woman ""bitch"" while talking to other males about her (not the ""bitch"" that implies she was horrible, just ""bitch"" as in a name some men call the objects that are women (in the last movie they were chicks and other things). The pole stripper looked angry too like Eddie's character seems to be through this whole movie but men wouldn't notice since they were looking elsewhere (maybe Eddie didn't want to be there either which would explain his acting through this movie). And just for no reason we have the Playboy mansion involved.The rapid scene changes that cut out or abruptly ended dialog got boring too. There is one ""memorable"" scene where Eddie's character makes a bet that a cash exchange will be the next place robbed (after someone else told him about the place and they had a computer with the location on it - duh) and then he didn't even finish the sentence and it was cut to the next scene. Seems they just added bits where Eddie's character would be the one man hero of the piece guessing where crimes would happen next etc and then rushed to show us he was right. Or maybe they just edited bits because with all the tit conversations they went overtime and had to get rid of some parts.All the people shooting in this movie are so bad - the hit man who shoots at the ground as Axel runs away and the police who shoot out car lights. Axel couldn't hit a person in a car that wasn't moving but coincidentally hit all the targets at the shooting place and hit people when it suit the ridiculous plot.The first time Axel laughs the ""Axel laugh"" in the movie is like a setup also because there's staged silence and then the horrible laugh that anyone can fake. As if we were being rewarded for waiting by being given the token signature laugh by our hero. Other times when he laughed in the movie he would laugh normally and then go back to that laugh again as if someone else told him he swayed from the path of crazy fake laugh central. I think Eddie Murphy just phoned this one in and his wooden acting, inappropriate yelling, and inappropriate facial expressions for emotions show it.

88,films-22537,"Eddie Murphy is a funny man, I wish someone told that to Tony Scott.",5,7 May 2020,"Eddie Murphy is good at telling jokes and making fun of people, but for some reason either Murphy himself or the filmmakers he worked with kept trying to turn him into an action star and traditional leading man. The weakest parts of the original Beverly Hills Cop were the action sequences you had to sit through in-between Murphy putting bananas in tailpipes and tricking snobby elites into giving him what he wants. You'd think for the sequel it would be more jokes and less paint by numbers boring action scenes, you'd be wrong.",Beverly Hills Cop II
89,tylerrosin,A solid sequel that's almost as fun as the original.,8,26 August 2021,Another great Eddie Murphy movie. While not as amazing as the first one it is still a fun and hilarious 80's movie. The plot was good and all the actors from the original came back. Great action and sharp dialogue with a great 80's soundtrack make this a blast of a film. One of my favorites.,Beverly Hills Cop II
90,zofos,The Heat Is Off,1,26 August 2008,"This movie is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst sequels ever. It's the same movie all over again, but without the intelligence, humour and charm that made the first film such a winner.Eddie Murphy returns as fish-out-of-water cop Axel Foley and he's at his loudest and most annoying here, shouting at the top of his lungs and speaking so fast that it's difficult to understand what he's saying (Nutty Professor 2 had the same problem, with those two and ""Another 48 Hours"" Eddie seems to make a mess of sequels).Director Tony Scott was hired to direct the sequel. He was hot off ""Top Gun"" the year before, but he's not a comedy director. He gives ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" his usual glossy look, but he mistimes all of the humour and it shows.You can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that's what happens here when Ronny Cox is shot (Foley's foul-mouthed boss, Inspector Todd, would be killed off in the next movie).Brigitte Nielsen, for the 5 minutes she was on Hollywood's A-list, is in among the cast. She only got the part after Sylvester Stallone invited Eddie Murphy over for dinner (Sly apparently fell under the table laughing at Eddie's Rocky impression).The screenplay for ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was nominated for an Oscar and that just goes to show you how good the original movie was. This movie got no such recognition. Actor and director Mel Smith once saw this movie at a Royal Premiere in London and he said: ""That is the biggest load of cr*p you will ever sit through in your life, I would have left, but you couldn't as there was royalty there."" I couldn't agree more. You should only watch this film at gunpoint. Otherwise, don't waste 2 hours of your life that you won't get back.",Beverly Hills Cop II
91,fidelio74,Tony Scott was to the eighties what Michael Bay was to the nineties,6,15 November 2010,"'Beverly Hills Cop II', while not as good as the first one, is still a great deal of fun. Eddie Murphy is wonderfully on form as the irreverent Detective Axel Foley, and he is joined again by Detective William 'Billy' Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), Detective Sergeant John Taggart (John Ashton), and Captain/Chief Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox).When Captain Bogomil is shot and left for dead, it proves to be the second in a series of 'alphabet crimes' which are sweeping Beverly Hills. Foley investigates, with his buddies Rosewood and Taggart backing him up, and soon they are mixing it up with statuesque femme fatale Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen) and her partner-in-crime Maxwell Dent (Jurgen Prochnow).While possessing an unfortunate dose of sexism, this sequel is thoroughly entertaining. The mixture of action and comedy is just right, and there is a fabulous car chase involving a... cement mixer! This really makes a change from Ferraris and Lamborghinis (Foley leaves his Ferrari - 'necessary' to his undercover work - back in Detroit, in the care of Detective Jeffrey Friedman (Paul Reiser), which turns out to be a very bad move indeed), and recalls 'The Italian Job' (1969), in which minis were used in an elaborate, show-stopping car chase rather than much faster performance vehicles.She has her share of detractors but I like Brigitte Nielsen and would love to see her make a comeback. She has that ice cold beauty and her stature alone makes her an impressive presence on screen. And I guess, like the very similar Michael Bay, you either love or loathe director Tony Scott. He really paved the way back in the eighties with his flashy visual style, born of his background in commercials. 'Beverly Hills Cop II' is a good example of this; it looks fantastic! While there is no theme song to rival Glenn Frey's electrifying 'The Heat is On' from the previous film, 'Shakedown', performed by Bob Seger, is pretty cool and sets the tone during the opening credits sequence. And look fast for a fledgling Chris Rock as a valet at the Playboy Mansion who is less than thrilled at Foley's arriving at a swank soiree in a cement mixer!",Beverly Hills Cop II
92,nuke_houston,A Heaping Pile,1,18 August 2019,"Unless you like Eddie Murphy when he was not Funny anymore (and just made movies for a paycheck), this movie is a heaping pile of crap, the smell just oozes out of the screen...cow manure and nigerian people.....",Beverly Hills Cop II
93,ShadySovereign,A great under-rated sequel,9,5 June 2005,"Beverly Hills Cop 2 was a smash hit when it was released to theaters in 1987. Many action fans really loved this movie, as well as fans of the first Beverly Hills Cop film.One of the reasons why Beverly Hills Cop 2 is such a great sequel is because of the return of the stars from the first film. Eddie Murphy is back, as well as Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronny Cox. In addition to them, some new characters are introduced such as Brigitte Nielsen & Jurgen Prochnow as the new villains, and the cute Alice Adair as Ronny Cox's daughter in the film.Another reason why this sequel is good is because of the way the action and comedy scenes are balanced. While not as funny as the first film, Beverly Hills Cop 2 has a nice balanced blend of action and comedy. This means that both action & comedy fans will love this movie.Here is the final reason that this sequel is good: So many great cameos are featured in the film! There are cameos by Paul Reiser (again), Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Rock, Hugh Hefner, Carrie Leigh, and DOZENS of sexy Playboy Playmates! Perhaps the only bad thing about the film is that there were many noticeable mistakes in editing. However, upon watching this movie more than 5 times, I got over the mistakes and managed to look past them. The good things about this movie far outweigh its disadvantages.To sum up, I strongly recommend this film to those who loved the first movie. It is a truly great sequel, one of the greatest movie sequels of all time. It follows very closely to the first film, and has an 80's feel to it just like the first movie. Don't miss those great cameos!",Beverly Hills Cop II
94,ultimatenexus,Just as Fun as the Original,6,28 August 2014,"I've noticed these movies are starting to follow a simple routine: a friend of Axel Foley's is attacked; Axel goes to Beverly Hills where he doesn't belong; Axel puts his job AND his life on the line as he searches for whoever's responsible; Axel gets into numerous spats with the Beverly Hills cops as he tries to prove to them that his suspects are indeed guilty; Axel is sent back home, but instead recruits someone (Taggert and Rosewood) into helping him prove his point; Axel turns out to be right, and bam, final showdown.While this formula has its limitations, there are many ways to pull it off, but only a few of them actually work. Luckily Tony Scott picked one of the ones that DO work.Here we have Axel drawn back to Beverly Hills after his friend Bogomil has been near-fatally shot by a group of 'alphabet thieves', who send the cops the first letter of the name of their next target. Fast- talking Axel eventually winds up in an arms smuggling operation with Rosewood and Taggert behind him every step of the way. Another threat to them is a cop--in fact, he's Chief Harold Lutz, an abusive moron who will look for the slightest excuse to fire someone. Axel is up to his usual antics, even going so far as to concoct a method of tricking the chief into thinking he's there on a 'multi-jurisdictional case'.While not as smart as the original, it's still a very entertaining movie that even provides a bit more development on Foley, Rosewood, and Taggert, with a few hilarious surprises from Rosewood.Tony Scott's sequel is more violent, grander in scale, and arguably funnier than the first. Even before his flashy, hyper-active camera style days with films like Domino and Man on Fire, you' know a Tony Scott movie when you saw it.Give it a watch. It's definitely a lot of fun, and only inferior to the first movie by a small margin.",Beverly Hills Cop II
95,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,Not As Much Fun As The First,6,2 September 2012,"I loved Beverly Hills Cop and I personally think that it's one of Eddie Murphy's best films. It's funny, well-written, and exciting. After seeing the first one, I really couldn't wait to sit down and watch the sequel. I figured it wouldn't be as great as the first was, but I still thought it would be a fun sequel that would provide more entertainment for those who enjoyed the first movie. Now while Beverly Hills Cop II is far from terrible, it's unfortunately a run of the mill sequel that does absolutely nothing new and was obviously just made for money. The plot is almost exactly identical to the first one and this one really pulls no punches. Now I wouldn't have had such a problem with that if this film would've bothered to amp itself up some more. But, Beverly Hills Cop II is actually tamer than the first film and that takes some of the fun out of it. The two new characters were really unnecessary and the film would've been better off without them. But one of the biggest problems I had with the film is that it felt as if the script had a laugh of laughs to it. Still, BHC II is entertaining enough to recommend as a rental, just don't expect it to be anywhere as good as the first film.",Beverly Hills Cop II
96,sd-forum,This sequel is a mess.,6,3 February 2020,"While the first movie is a timeless classic, this sequel has not aged well. I give the original 9 and this is 6 at best. probably should be lower. The first one had an interesting story and the power struggle was the strong point. This sequel is a total mess in every aspect.",Beverly Hills Cop II
97,edwardjamessmith,Probably one of the Best sequels to any film!,10,26 February 2008,"Beverly Hills Cop II is pure entertainment.Eddie Murphy's character Axel Foley is better than ever in this sequel to the 1984 original. The film's story is much better than the original, the soundtrack's great, there's a lot of humor and action. Tony Scott was so good at directing this (one of his best along with TOP GUN and True Romance). The film's got a great cast with Jurgen Prochnow (The Keep,Dune,In The Mouth Of Madness) and Dean Stockwell (Dune,Blue Velvet,To Live and Die in L.A.) are great as Foley's villains. Rating 10/10, an excellent sequel that doesn't disappoint and is worth the money to buy or the time to watch. If there's a BEVERLY HILLS COP IV, Tony Scott should direct.",Beverly Hills Cop II
98,mike683,A sturdy sequel.,8,5 January 2018,"Sequels rarely meet or exceed their predecessors, but I must admit this one runs just about par for the course. To start with, a solid cast of bad guys/girls lends to the antagonistic nature of the film. The evildoers rely on a sophisticated and heavy dose of violence to ransack the southern California area, which lends a Thomas Crown aspect to the plot.Slide over to the protagonist side and you get a familiar treatment of characters, who deliver solid police work wrapped around the antics of the ever-popular streetwise Detroit cop. The inclusion of resistance from department management creates an additional level of odds to circumvent and overcome. Toss in a visit into the world of Playboy and there is enough of a cinematic blend of beauty and violence to satisfy the entire audience. The pumping soundtrack is a great enhancement to the flow of the story and once again, the relationship between Todd and Foley is as entertaining as it gets. Sit down, grab your popcorn, and prepare to enjoy a fast-paced return trip through the streets of Beverly Hills, with a little Detroit added in for good measure.",Beverly Hills Cop II
99,QoS007,Underrated and keeps the series going strong,7,15 April 2021,"Really fun follow up to the original 1984 hit! Moves quicker and adds more well known actors from the decade.

101,martynmccarthy1965,Eddie Murphy IS Axel Foley ...,7,13 April 2019,"Eddie Murphy reprises his role as Axel Foley, a rule-bending, maverick cop from Detroit, who this time absconds from his duties there to use his unique talents in tracking down the perpetrators who are beind the shooting of his friend Captain Bogamil. He is once again aided by his two other friends from the first film, Detectives Rosewood and Taggart, their own efforts being hindered by an incompetant and obnoxious supperior officer.Co-written and produced by Murphy, this affair turns into more of a showcase of Murphy, whose character dominates the plot more than in the original. In doing so this pushes Reinhold and Ashton a bit further out of the limelight, giving the movie less of a sparkle than the first film. It is only towards the end of the movie that Reinhold has the opportunity to deliver some of his better material, and it is in remarkable shift in character from his original image. It works well, but arrives a bit too late in the film to develop further.Despite the cliches that pervade the film, it is still remains a fast paced, funny and thoroughly entertaining film. Brigette Neilsen is a commendable femme fatale. Note the tongue-in-cheek swipes at other movies popular during the era (1980s), and at her man ~ Sylvester Stallone.Like the first film there is a bit of 80s naughtiness. Strip clubs appear in many cops & robbers genre films throughout the era. Whereas many of the performances in such movies are often very brief and very bland, if you don't mind such entertainment, the late Teal Roberts delivers a gutsy performance on the pole dance.",Beverly Hills Cop II
102,YouelleArge99,Sequel that doesn't beat the original but still fun,7,22 May 2020,"Yeah, this is a throwaway thriller from back in the days but it aged well. Murphy makes this movie work. His intensity and high- level acting pushes what should have been an average action/comedy sequel over the top.Would I not recommend hunting this film down just to watch it but if it was on television and you had nothing better to do, it is a relatively good waste of time. 7/10.",Beverly Hills Cop II
103,tenacious_david,Axels Back,9,16 January 2007,"Eddie Murphy's come back to film that had made him to inflict more great action and comedy up on us!Axel Foley is back and more dangerous than ever in his mischievous ways. The film plots around the fact of new criminal's in Beverly hills and that after every crime they do they leave an envelope marked with a letter of the alphabet leaving the Beverly Hills Police department with giving them the name of ""The Alphabet Crimes"" the criminals start there crime by robbing a jewellery shop and leaving an envelope marked with ""A"" then secondly they shoot Capt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) for getting way too close to finding the Alphabet criminals and in turn they leave a envelope marked with ""B"". Jan Bogomil (Alice Adair) who is a new character added to the film as Andrew Bogomil's daughter, she phones Axel in Detroit about her father being shot and obviously Axel rushes straight to Beverly Hills to team up with once again Det. William Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Det. Sgt. John Taggart (John AShton)to bring us great action and comedy in following the foot steps of Andrew Bogomil to find the criminals who had shot Andrew. The criminals include: Maxwell Dent (Jurgen Prochnow), Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielson) and finally Charles Chip Cain (Dean Stockwell).

105,FatChino,"Weak, Murphy sure has a big smile, but weak ... and this was the 80s!",3,29 June 2005,"The 80s seems to have specialised in this time of throw away entertainment. Sure it had its promising moments too; there was an Alien and the first Terminator in there, but this was the decade of the macho, gun-totting, mulleted male. The emphasise of style over content is here for all to see, with the excesses of the 80s for all to see (I'd like to say we have evolved since then but I am really not sure).Eddie Murphy returns to Beverly Hills again, all smiles and one liners to help the ungrateful local cops out with the 'alphabet robberies' (ooowwwww scary). Shoot-outs, pretty pathetic high speed chases, and illogical trips to a strip joint and the Playboy Mansion follow. On the way we see plenty of the semi-nudity that the 80s seem to specialise in (sorry 80s), and the sickeningly smug Foley (Murphy), the 'psycho' gun-enthusiast Billy (Reinhold), and the hapless Taggart (Ashton) bungle their way to solving the case and saving the day.Clichés seem to pop out at every turn. The idiotic and constantly angry chief of police, the wise-cracking cop who learned his trade 'on the street', the portrayal of a strong female character as 'that big bitch over there' and the solving of the case after finding a match book (surely that has been used in Scooby Doo before!). The ease with which Murphy's character is able to evade shipment out of the city and fool the local cops is infuriately stupid.Two lines summed up the unforgivable nature of this film for me. After enduring the latest verbal assault from the local police chief Foley, making light of race relations states supposedly humorously ""is it a black thing?"". Later in the film after disposing of a key criminal who just happens to be a woman Taggart tuts ""Women"". Come I know i must be taking this film just a bit too seriously, but there can't be anyone out there who finds awful and insulting one liners like this funny, can there? Ultimately between the distractions of the odd breast and an appearance by Hugh Hefner, an engaging storyline fails to emerge and the viewer is left with the infamous theme tune stuck in his/her head.",Beverly Hills Cop II

108,scuderia_filipinetti,Deserves more credit,9,22 October 2013,"This movie gets a lot of bad press and I have no idea why. For me, the BHC concept was in good hands with Tony Scott. From the very first shot, with the thick orange camera filter looking over the oilfields, accompanied by the classic sounds of Harold Faltermeyer, to the final scenes at the same fields, it is a thoroughly entertaining movie as Axel, Billy and Taggart team up to investigate the Aplhabet-murders. If you want, there is much to be said about the execution of the movie, or about the lack of a storyline, but surely, with a cast like Jurgen Prochnow (""Adriano was not perfect""), Brigitte Nielsen depicting the quintessential broadshoulderd eighties woman and the not-a-care-in-the-world humor of Eddy Murphy, who really needs a truly compelling story? There are lots of other movies way better equipped to fulfill that particular need. BHCII isn't one of them, nor does it pretend to be. Judge the movie for what it is, a classic popcorn action comedy, and then you'll see it is actually a fantastic ride.",Beverly Hills Cop II
109,robinwhitlock1966,Foley's methods of entering premises by trickery I find particularly interesting...,8,3 August 2013,"One of the most interesting things I've noticed about both Beverley Hills Cop and Beverley Hills Cop 2 is the methods Foley uses to enter premises and engineer situations to his advantage. In the first movie, mostly these consist of bluff, for example the scene where he pretends to be an out-of-town reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine in order to rent a room at the Beverley Palms Hotel and later on his depiction of himself as Maitland's gay lover with an unfortunate affliction of herpes simplex 10. However, in the second movie, the comedy in many circumstances hangs on the presumption that there are actually a lot of stupid people in society. This is illustrated clearly in the scene where he poses as a Beverley Hills Building Inspector and convinces the foreman of a team of builders working on a house that the plans have changed and there shouldn't be any right angles on the building. This trick is replicated in a subsequent scene where he successfully convinces a receptionist at the Beverley Hills Gun Club that there actually is such things as explosive bullets that are sensitive to sound and can potentially go off at the slightest whisper. In essence, Foley performs a multitude of different sketches within each movie, adopting different characters as he goes along, each character having his own unique 'story' and/or 'bio'. There is the Rolling Stone reporter, the security official who bluffs his way into Maitland's warehouse, (BHC 1) the Metalux explosive research company courier who delivers the sound-sensitive ammunition, 'Johnny Wishbone' the psychic from the Isle of Saint Croix (BHC2), and so on. It is this ability to constantly change character that gives both movies such a unique and colourful slant.",Beverly Hills Cop II
110,orangerunner,Disappointing Sequel,3,6 July 2005,"I remember waiting in line on May 25, 1987 , opening day, when I was 14 years old eagerly anticipating this movie.Five minutes into the movie my heart sank. This movie was the ultimate glossy, high-powered empty ""comedy/action"" film. Even at age 14, I could tell this one stunk. Here were some of the reasons I felt this way.1. Eddie Murphy is bitter and angry throughout the movie. There is no joy in this performance. He's constantly yelling and screaming at everybody.Think back to the first movie when he pretended to be gay in order to get into the hotel buffet. He used his wit and intelligence to get himself through the gate. In BVC II he yells and insults everyone who dares to get in his way.2. When did Axl become fishing buddies with Ronny Cox? 3. The character Billy Rosewood becomes a gun nut for no real reason other than the writers thought it would be a funny direction to take the character.This movie could have generated a simple laugh by having Axl still driving around in his old blue Chevy Nova. But no, he's only shown driving a Ferrari and BMW(?)convertible.",Beverly Hills Cop II
