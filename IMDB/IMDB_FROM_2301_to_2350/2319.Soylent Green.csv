0,MartinHafer,Far deeper and intelligent than what first meets the eye,9,19 July 2006,"This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause, I have always found this difference fascinating.The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including ""furniture""--a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are dirt poor, unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss--it could ruin the film for you. However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. Plus, it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound.",Soylent Green
1,bkoganbing,A Hopeless World,9,4 January 2007,"The only other film besides Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms. On the Beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet.Maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now. New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming. For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck. Obviously there's no family planning in this world either.Charlton Heston is an NYPD detective who lives with room mate Edward G. Robinson who's old enough to remember the Earth before catastrophe struck. There's been a murder committed, Joseph Cotten an executive with the Soylent Corporation, a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product, some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population. It's latest product is Soylent Green.The investigation finds Charlton Heston getting his man, but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind. As Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people, that we've become a race of cannibals, the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative. We've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson even though they had differing political views. A few weeks after Robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia, he passed away in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally ill and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.Though the timetable was off, it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come to pass. Hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence, but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening.",Soylent Green
2,SnoopyStyle,needs more action,6,15 November 2014,"It's the year 2022. Earth is polluted and overcrowded. NYC has a population of 40M. Nothing really works anymore and natural resources are scarce. Soylent Industries controls the food supply for half the world and soylent green is the newest form. Frank Thorn (Charlton Heston) is a NYPD detective who lives with his elderly friend Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson). Thorn is given the murder case of the wealthy elite William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten) presumed to be a burglary. Simonson has a mysterious conversation with the burglar before he's killed. Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young) is a concubine or ""furniture"" that comes with the apartment. Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors) is his bodyguard. Thorn suspects an assassination and then higher ups start interfering with his investigation.There is an interesting concept here but it needs more action. All the ideas are well incorporated into the movie although the green haze is done badly. The movie needs to have faster pacing and some action would help. Heston is a solid lead but he's somewhat alone. Robinson still has great presence but the girl is just a pretty face. This is a movie where eating a simple meal is fascinating. The movie spends too much time immersing in this sci-fi world while the investigation moves at a snail's pace. The riot is big enough but the scoops are too silly. When the action does come, it's not the most exciting.",Soylent Green
3,Prismark10,Eating Raoul,5,7 July 2017,"Director Richard Fleischer could me some odd looking campy films and I am afraid the costumes in this Dystopian futuristic film makes you wonder why the male characters are dressed in such a foppish way.Set in 2022, the planet is suffering from the greenhouse effect and global warming. There is overpopulation, homelessness and an increased divide between the rich and the underclass.Pollution has meant food is in short supply and Soylent Industries makes from plankton called Soylent Green. Real food whether it is meat or vegetable is a rare luxury.When an executive of Soylent Industries is brutally killed Detective Thorn (Charlton Heston) investigates. Thorn lives with an elderly scholar Sol Roth (Edward G Robinson) who tells Thorn about the old days and helps with his investigation. Thorn enters a world of the rich with their fancy apartments, treacherous bodyguards and accompanying furniture who are young beautiful women who come with apartment.Thorn soon finds out that the rich and powerful are trying to disrupt his investigation by applying pressure to his bosses. The murdered executive felt guilty about something and confessed to a preacher who himself has been executed. There is a secret about the food chain which Thorn is determined to find out.Charlton Heston despite his increasing right wing views as he got older did make several films about an environmentally degraded world. The film has a famous reveal about what exactly is Soylent Green but it really does looked aged in parts, slow going and not very convincing despite its interesting premise of an environment destroyed by humans. The treatment of women as just playthings is despicable.This was the last appearance of Edward G Robinson who died soon after the film was completed. The most emotional scene is regarding his euthanasia surrounded by images of fields, forests, mountains, animals, rivers, sunsets and piped classical music.",Soylent Green
4,mark.waltz,Only five years from now...be forewarned!,6,10 September 2017,"Not as potent as it was nearly 45 years ago, ""Soylent Green"" is a variation of the ""1984"" theme, a grim view of an undesirable future. It's 2022 New York City, overpopulated and certainly not an apple right off the tree. In fact, there are very few trees left in the city, and very little food. When food does become available, it's from the Soylent company, and here green is the preferred product. What it is exactly is no surprise to film historians, but to those who do not know, it is beyond shocking.At times, the film moves very slowly, but it's a slow road to the inevitable revelation. This is a frightening world where the living are nearly dead inside and desperation is severely felt. You can almost feel the stench, one that even in the heat of the summer, New York hasn't felt yet. In a sense, the film has to move at this speed to get the emotions in the viewers going, and once the film reaches its destination, you are so numbed by the horror of the future that the impact of it all is that much stronger.Reunited from ""The Ten Commandments"", Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are friends here, not foes, and when police officer Heston brings Robinson home some surprises, the joy on EGR's face is tear inducing. In fact, Robinson gives a performance so beautiful, it's the best screen swan song an actor could have. He gets a farewell in a scene so poignant that you might be shaking in emotion. Robinson didn't get the Oscar nomination he richly deserved, but an honorary one was given to him, sadly posthumously.A supporting cast of many well known actors of the time goes from Joseph Cotten as a murdered millionaire, Chuck Conners as a brutal assassin, Leigh Taylor Young as a presumed high class prostitute, Brock Peters as Heston's supervisor aware of the conspiracy, Leonard Stone as a slimy pimp, Whit Bissel as the governor (running the state from a tent in what used to be Gramercy Park) and Paula Kelly as Conners' mistress. This is sometimes hard to watch because it sometimes seems so possible, yet ridiculously outlandish in normal times. But normal times have long disappeared, and sensitive viewers may indeed see this as a living nightmare of where society is heading...or possibly reached.",Soylent Green
5,claudio_carvalho,A Sci-Fi Film that Has not Aged,10,9 October 2011,"In 2022, Earth is overpopulated and totally polluted; the natural resources have exhaust and the nourishment of the population is supplied by the Soylent Industries, a food made by plankton from the oceans. In New York, when the Soylent's member of the board William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton) is murdered apparently by a burglar at the Chelsea Towers West where he lives, the efficient Detective Thorn (Charlton Heston) is assigned to investigate the case with his partner Solomon ""Sol"" Roth (Edward G. Robinson). Thorn comes to the fancy apartment and meets Simonson's bodyguard Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors) and the ""furniture"" (woman that is rented together with the flat) Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young) and the detective concludes that the executive was not victim of burglary but executed. Further, he finds that the Governor Santini (Whit Bissell) and other powerful men want to disrupt and end his investigation. But Thorn continues his work and discovers that the oceans have exhausted and the bizarre and disturbing secret of the ingredient used to manufacture Soylent Green.""Soylent Green"" is one of the best sci-fi ever made and a film that has not aged. On the contrary, when I saw it in the movie theater in 1973, it was another good film with catastrophic view of the future. Along the years, I have seen this film on VHS at least four more times and every time that I see it, I find it better and better. In Brazil, this film has not been released on DVD or Blu-ray, only in the movie-theater in 1973 and on a rare VHS with the title ""No Mundo de 2020"" (translation: ""In the World of 2020"", despite the story takes place in 2022) and I have just bought the imported Blu-Ray and saw it again.It is impressive how the writer Harry Harrison was capable to foresee the future in 1966 with pollution, overpopulation and menace of exhaustion of the natural resources and write his novel ""Make Room! Make Room!"". In those years, the concept of ecology did not exist, at least the same way in the present days. The grim view of the cannibalism to fee the population introduced by Stanley R. Greenberg in the screenplay fortunately has not been achieved yet.""Soylent Green"" is also the film number 101 in the career of the unforgettable actor Edward G. Robinson that was with cancer and almost deaf during the shooting and died two weeks after the conclusion of this film. The Blu-Ray has in the extras a tribute to this great actor. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""No Mundo de 2020"" (""In the World of 2020"")",Soylent Green
6,classicsoncall,"""Soylent Green is people!""",8,29 June 2008,"I remember the spirited controversy surrounding ""Soylent Green"" when it first came out and oddly, I didn't go to see it back in 1973. I'm sorry I didn't, I was only about ten minutes into the picture today when I thought to myself that it was pretty remarkable. The opening scene was intended to portray what trouble would be in store for Earth and mankind some fifty years into the future, back when there were a couple billion people less on the planet than there are now. However the projection of New York City's population of forty million in 2022 isn't going to happen. Nice try though, and hey, present day environmentalists and global warming enthusiasts will no doubt find solace in the story's grim projections about the greenhouse effect and 'everything burning up'. But only two years later, in 1975, Newsweek Magazine had a cover story about the threat of global COOLING and the anticipated problems of shorter growing seasons and the possibility of worldwide famine due to crop failures. It all goes in cycles you see, and by the time the 'real' 2022 rolls around, there will no doubt be yet another different spin on global climate change, when in fact, the Earth's temperature doesn't really vary much at all.Hey, how about 'Tuesday is Soylent Green Day'; I still remember the ads for 'Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day'. You don't see or hear those anymore, in fact my local supermarket doesn't even carry Prince spaghetti anymore. How about Sol Roth's description of soylent - ""tastleless, odorless, crud'! Speaking of Sol Roth, it was cool seeing Edward G. Robinson in his final film role, even if some of his dialog with Charlton Heston had me doing double takes regarding their masculinity. It reminded me of a Robinson role going all the way back to 1931 opposite James Cagney no less, screen legends who managed to confound this viewer with expressions of 'sweetheart' and 'dearie' in the film ""Smart Money"". And holy cow!, the film also featured the old Rifleman himself, Chuck Connors, as a bodyguard for the assassinated director of The Soylent Corporation. I sort of wished he had his tricked out rifle along but that would have changed the whole tempo of things. The Joseph Cotten appearance had me a little baffled, I think a little more time could have been spent on his 'willingness' to be murdered.You know, the picture reminded me a lot of one of my favorite 'Twilight Zone' episodes from a dozen years earlier, and I wouldn't be surprised if that story might have had a small impact on ""Soylent Green"". In 'Soylent', if you're thinking ahead and don't know the ending (kind of hard I know with the notoriety it's engendered), the first inkling you might have had about the title foodstuff would have come when the 'diggers' were called in for the rioting populace. All those bodies being hauled off to an unknown outcome kind of gives you a hint that 'Soylent Green is people'! In the TZ episode 'To Serve Man', the finale is reached with a lot more subtlety and it hits you a lot more forcefully. For the uninitiated, the title comes from the story of an alien race that solves all of Earth's problems, and in return, appreciative Earthlings travel through space to visit the planet of the Kanamits. The punch line - 'To Serve Man' was the aliens' cookbook! The only other thought I have has to do with the film's status as a sci-fi flick. Even though the concept is definitely in that league, others on this board have mentioned that the filming and effects utilized didn't distinguish it from some of the other memorable films of the era, for example, 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", or 1971's ""A Clockwork Orange"". Heck, even as far back as the 1950's, you had pictures like ""War of the Worlds"" (1953) and ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956) using much more in the way of special effects to tell their story. Even so though, given those apparent budget limitations, the picture is still a unique achievement and holds up pretty well after lo, these three decades. I'm sure a modern day re-make would add a few more twists, but then again, as with so many movies, there's nothing like the original.",Soylent Green
7,gavin6942,One of the Great Heston Science Fiction Films,7,10 March 2013,"In an overpopulated futuristic Earth, a New York police detective (Charlton Heston) finds himself marked for murder by government agents when he gets too close to a bizarre state secret involving the origins of a revolutionary and needed new foodstuff.I have checked the spoiler box because I may accidentally say too much about the end. I think just about everyone knows what the ""twist"" is in this movie, but I will try to be careful just the same. The twist is, in fact, the worst part of this film. Rather than being the big shocker that it should be, audiences have enough hints throughout the picture that it should be anticlimactic by the time everything is revealed. And that is just too bad.Unfortunately, that build up tends to be the bulk of the film (because of how it ties in to the primary plot -- a murder investigation). The murder case and eventual reveal could have actually been done in just about any world. Yet, here we have a world of overpopulation, poverty, women being used as ""furniture""... and these concepts are never really explored. Why do people sleep on the stairs rather than in the street? If the world is overheated, I would much rather be in an alley than a staircase! Charlton Heston is great, of course, but the heart and soul of this movie are in Edward G. Robinson. Making this film while almost completely deaf and dying of cancer, he is the most human character in the film. He may be the only one who remembers the world the way it used to be, the way we (the audience) expect the world to be. Robinson nails it, giving the performance of his career. I love his noir and gangster work, but this was tops.",Soylent Green
8,lee_eisenberg,the wearing of the green...,7,16 April 2006,"In the '70s, Charlton Heston starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality. ""Soylent Green"" is one of the better ones. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 New York. In this future, most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product, he finds himself on the run.I guess that it's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays. But even so, it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his final role).",Soylent Green
9,rmax304823,Man Eaters of New York.,7,30 December 2008,"It's New York about thirty years from now, crowded beyond belief, polluted, filled with garbage, uncomfortably hot all year round, and all commodities scarce except for the tasteless crackers called Soylent -- just like the rest of the world.Charlton Heston is a New York City cop cooped up with his crotchety friend and researcher (his ""book"", because books are scarce), Edward G. Robinson. An extremely wealthy businessman, Joseph Cotten, is beaten to death in his luxury apartment and Heston is assigned to the case. He makes his way on foot to Cotten's apartment, stepping over the bodies, living and dead, that are piled on the streets and stairways.Well -- this is some apartment! Heston walks in and gazes stupefied at the tchotchkas and the furniture. The ""furniture"" includes the succulent Leigh Taylor-Young. No wonder he gawks. She comes with the apartment, if the resident wants her to, because living space is almost impossible to find.Heston, whom we are used to seeing as an upright man of principle, strides casually around the scene of the crime, chatting with Taylor-Young before he beds her down. Does he steal anything from the well-stocked apartment? ""Everything I could lay my hands on."" There's some wilted lettuce, a half-turgid stalk of celery, and two apples. There's even a cut of beef. Heston takes it all home to Robinson, who is old enough to remember what this stuff is, and Robinson makes a bit of stew out of it and helps drain the confiscated bottle of bourbon. Heston takes an indifferent munch out of the lettuce but Robinson has tears in his eyes and he savors the feast.The trail gets a little twisted. Cotten turns out to have been on the board of Soylent AND a relative of the mayor. People begin to tail Heston and take pot shots at him. His boss, Brock Peters, tells him to lay off the case, as all cops' bosses do. In other words, something is rotten in the state of New York besides the garbage. Actually, there may be no more state of New York. The city of New York now adjoins the city of Philadelphia. (Good-bye, New Jersey.) Looking northward, the boundary may abut the city of Boston, perhaps somewhere around East Windsor, Connecticut.Heston persists in following the few clues that show up, not so much out of morality but because he doesn't want to lose his job. But Robinson discovers the secret behind Soylent first. It depletes whatever resources Robinson had left and he decides to have an institution send him on his eternal journey.In a poignant scene, Robinson is wheeled into a room of his favorite color, given a painless poison, and is free to watch movies of an earth with natural features that are pristine and beautiful and majestic -- all the things we are recklessly discarding as we carry on with our daily lives now -- and Robinson is treated to a melange of light classics that include romantic snatches of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, Tchaikovsky, and Grieg. Heston bursts in and is more astonished by the IMAX images of deer, snow-veined Alps, apple blossoms, and rolling ocean than he was at the slab of meat. Meat, Heston recognized for what it was. But he's never seen anything like the film he -- and Robinson in his last moments -- witness. Heston is unable to even speak.Anyway, he follows Robinson's body out of the Extinction Room or whatever it is, and he too discovers the secret behind the mystery of Soylent, which by now every viewer has also figured out. The film doesn't end on a particularly hopeful note.How well does the movie do at predicting what the world will look like in fifty years? Well, yes and no. It makes the usual assumption that the future will have what we have now, only there will be more of it and it will be bigger. (The futuristic movies of the 1930s had propeller-driven airplanes in every garage.) The quantum leaps that introduce revolutionary social and technological change are usually missed. (The jet airplane did more than make cross-country movement faster; it vulgarized travel, homogenized the world, and eliminated the exotic.) The movie (and presumably the original story) also got the chief assumption behind population growth wrong. Right now, there are more than 6 billion people in the world. This number will more than double by 2050, along with all the problems that accompany it -- pollution, urban sprawl, scarce commodities, and the rest of it. But the streets will never be filled with piles of supernumeraries. Population irruptions such as we're undergoing now, have been studied in numerous animal populations. Thomas Malthus, E. O. Wilson, E. T. Hall, and Paul Ehrlich have written about what happens, and so have I, if I can put myself in this exalted company. What happens is that the population ""crashes"" from stress-related diseases or opportunistic infections before the hand-to-mouth phase is reached. Ulcers, heart failure, and AIDS are examples. Wars too, if you can think of them as a stress-related disease. To paraphrase Malthus, if we don't stop it, Nature will.Don't get me started on cannibalism either. Anthropologists don't only ask ""why""; they also ask ""why not""? Do I have a few more lines left? If I get too close to the limit, somebody flap a napkin at me. This may sound queer, but it may be Charlton Heston's best performance, including his efforts at Shakespeare. He's not a very expressive actor but his insouciance as he wanders through the dead Cotten's apartment, opening drawers, leaving nonchalant insults in his wake, openly stuffing a pillow case with every valuable in sight (except Leigh Taylor-Young, who is too big), is marvelous. He's played ""masterful"" many times before, but never with such irony.",Soylent Green
10,ma-cortes,A cop investigates a strange murder in an overcrowded New York City and discovers terrible events,7,23 April 2012,"This is a superb sci-fi movie upon a classic novel written by Harry Harrison titled : Make room ! Make room ! . In 2022, the population of New York has about forty million inhabitants living in miserable conditions and grossly overcrowded , a real hellhole , and Manhattan has become a big rubbish . In the overpopulated futuristic city , a New York police detective named ""Thorn (Charlton Heston) , finds himself marked for murder by government agents when he gets too close to a bizarre state secret involving the origins of a revolutionary and needed new foodstuff . Food is so scarce and to combat hunger the government creates a strange product , a synthetic food made of soybeans and lentils , the ""Soylent Green¨ (title refers to a precious stuff) for people to eat , but the cop and his old partner named Roth (Edward G. Robinson), a survivor from another era , are investigating killing of bigwig , and they suspect the tracks behind the new food result to be a little unsettling . In the process , Thorn stumbles onto explosive secret .Richard Fleischer creates a magnificent science fiction film without special effects and full of intrigue , drama , thrills , suspense , fights and interesting issues . Charlton Heston starred a pessimistic but well-intentioned trilogy about a Dystopian Earth : ¨Soylent Green¨ along with ""The Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Omega Man"", all great films . The whole film has a great originality from the narrative view-point , dealing with a cop who investigates and discovers an incredible government secret . It has a great plot for a very bitter ending , which is accompanied by a sensitive musical score . The best moments of the movie are given by starring Charlton Heston providing a good acting and especially the presence of Edward G. Robinson in his last film , a kind of testament of his own life where Robinson says us goodbye . In very serious health due to cancer, Edward G. Robinson was almost entirely deaf when he made this movie, and he was only able to hear anyone if they spoke directly into his ear. Because of this, scenes with him talking to other people had to be shot several times before he got the rhythm of the dialogue and was able to respond to people as if he could really hear them. And because he was unable to hear director Richard Fleischer yell ""cut"" when a scene went wrong, Robinson would often go on acting out the scene, unaware that shooting had stopped seconds earlier . The musical score of the film is plenty of classic soundtrack , as the score heard when Edward G. Robinson was ""going home"" is the following one : The overture was the principal theme from the first movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the ""Pathetique."" When the visual presentation starts, the music is the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ""Symphony nº6 ,The Pastoral"". When the flock of sheep appear, the music is ""Morning"" from Edvard Grieg's ""Peer Gynt Suite .The director Fleischer showing efficiently he doesn't need special effects to carry out the horror of the prophecies of Malthus . The last fifteen years the Richard Fleischer's films were not exactly very bright , filming Charles Bronson or Chuck Norris vehicles , but in his first twenty-five years had proved his own right as one of the most interesting directors of American commercial cinema . He was an expert director , including classy adventures (Vikings, 20.000 leagues under sea) and noir cinema (Narrow margin , Clay pigeons , Trapped) . The film will appeal to Sci-Fi buffs with enough though-provoking themes to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Charlton Heston enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because thrills, action and intrigue are brilliantly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact . Rating : Better than average , watchable movie and well worth seeing .",Soylent Green
11,moonspinner55,"""Soylent Green is...!"" an unbearable downer",5,28 January 2006,"Charlton Heston plays a cop in overpopulated, undernourished 2022 New York City who stumbles upon government secret involving the foodstuff everyone is eating. Another pessimistic vision of a grim, grimy future with memorable scenes of angry crowds pushing and shoving, but unmemorable Heston just going through the motions. Even in his quieter moments with roommate Edward G. Robinson (in his final bow), Heston is about as lively as a brick. As square, colorless thrillers go, ""Soylent Green"" is tolerable, however it's less a movie and more of an idea that isn't quite realized. Robinson has a bravura dying scene, surrounded by comforting lights and glorious scenes of nature on a wide screen, but the film is melodramatic instead of menacing. ** from ****",Soylent Green
12,Quinoa1984,"not quite as campy as one might expect, near classic sci-fi",8,17 April 2008,"Soylent Green - the words run shivers down your spine, kind of. At first 'Soylent' sounds like something you might put on your white rice at some fancy Chinese food restaurant. But in reality, at least the reality of 2022 New York, it's almost all that life is. In a future that wasn't too far from the truth as of 2008 in comparison to the conglomerization of corporations (i.e. fewer and fewer companies own things, now it's all scrunched together), 50% of the world's food is by the Soylent corporation, and meat or actual vegetables are so rare a commodity they have to be stolen undercover. Books are also hard to come by, so much so that they too need to be hidden from sight. It's in this realm of a dangerous, overcrowded and overcontroled society that Soylent Green, as a film, gains its power. It's a pretty frightening scenario, if filmed nevertheless (for the last time apparently) on 'old-school' MGM sets.Charlton Heston is very cool as a hero cop who just tries to do his job so someone else doesn't take it. He has a roommate/mentor in Edward G. Robinson's Sol (Robinson's last role, he still's got it), and he reminds him of the 'good old days', where it wasn't the people so much as just having things, knowing things actually existed that didn't keep people trapped. Heston is investigating a murder of a high-society chap (Joseph Cotton, barely on-screen for a scene), who turns out to be an ex-board of director's member of Soylent corp. There's more than Heston would've thought, especially as he's tailed, falls for the young girl who used to look after Cotton's apartment, and soon finds the one tailing him is really out to kill him. What is the big deal about this guy, or for that matter Soylent Green? The answer is obvious to anyone who's had the film told to them what it's about (Heston's line towards the end is the sibling-quote to his last lines in Planet of the Apes, to put it that way). But even with that twist in the climax, it all unfolds in a fascinating form. It's mature sci-fi, with only a few jokey parts (i.e. the trucks plowing people away), and a hard edge to it, at least as far as hard-edged Charlton Heston vehicles can get. It's not even so much Fleischer's direction that makes it so compelling- though he is a consummate professional through and through and does, to his credit, make those final minutes with Robinson in the screening room incredible as moving cinema- but the screenplay. There's a lot to think about behind some of the dated action scenes; there's a thought process to go just a step farther, as entertainment and intellectually, as a piece of commercial work. By the time those over-acted lines are belted out, the message has been made quite clear. I liked it a lot. A-",Soylent Green
13,BandSAboutMovies,We're living in this movie,10,28 September 2018,"As we were rewatching this film last week, Becca said, ""It always seems so hot in this movie, everyone is sweating all the time."" And I replied, ""Yeah. We're kind of living in it now."" Yep, other than turning people into food and my stairwells being filled with sleeping people, the world of Soylent Green feels like its getting closer every single day.Was Charlton Heston the poster boy of the apocalypse? Between this, Planet of the Apes and The Omega Man, Chuck was in a ton of end of the war films. This is based on Harry Harrison's book Make Room, Make Room. Harrison's writing may seem like slam bang science fiction action, but it hides in its heart plenty of satire and a marked disdain for violence and the military.Heston plays NYPD detective Frank Thorn, who lives with his elderly police analyst Solomon Roth, played by Edward G. Robinson in his final role. I can barely watch him in this movie without being moved to tears, as he died from bladder cancer 12 days after filming ended. Heston said, ""He knew while we were shooting, though we did not, that he was terminally ill. He never missed an hour of work, nor was late to a call. He never was less than the consummate professional he had been all his life. I'm still haunted, though, by the knowledge that the very last scene he played in the picture, which he knew was the last day's acting he would ever do, was his death scene. I know why I was so overwhelmingly moved playing it with him."" That scene decimates me every single time that I watch it, as Solomon realizes that his time, a time that remembers the past (he's one of the few alive who can read from old books) is now gone. As he lies in state as part of the euthanasia process, Thorn tries in vain to stop him but is soon mesmerized by the footage of extinct animals and a once green world.Outside of Sol, everyone in this film is corrupt. Thorn and his fellow cops steal everything they can from the murder scenes that they investigate when they aren't being riot cops, using bulldozers to lift people and throw them in the air. He even takes advantage of murder victim William R. Simonson's (Joseph Cotten!) live-in lover, Shiri (some women in the future are allowed to be concubines and live in luxury; Thorn refers to her as furniture). And Chuck Connors shows up as Simonson's bodyguard.This film frightens me because so much of it is prophetic. The Twin Towers are gone in this future. The things that Sol says to Thorn, like ""Ocean's dying, plankton's dying"" are happening as well. This movie is nearly fifty years old and predicts the greenhouse effect that so many people don't want to see is happening.Director Richard Fleischer would go on to have a career of ups and downs. The son of animator Max Fleischer, he'd also direct Amityville 3-D, Red Sonja, Conan the Destroyer, Fantastic Voyage, Madingo, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and the horrific Neal Diamond vehicle, The Jazz Singer. That's probably the most all over the place directorial credits ever.",Soylent Green
14,Coventry,"Now, THIS is what we call Science-Fiction!",7,17 July 2005,"""Soylent Green"" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes""). THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.",Soylent Green

16,Theo Robertson,The Best Environmental Film Of Its Era,7,19 May 2003,"As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . Overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ? I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . Stalin`s policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was Mao`s rural policy in China which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . And let`s not forget the great famines in the horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . You might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on Earth , Hong Kong and Macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . Likewise  the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( It`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of New York city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughableBut don`t be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because I consider this to be the best ecological film of the70s . It plays on the contempary audience`s knowledge of the world where Sol and Thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . Thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line "" If I could afford it I`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day "" . But it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as Thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world Thorn`s generation has never known . This is a very haunting scene which makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of Edward G Robinson as the wise old Jew Sol Roth",Soylent Green
17,Hey_Sweden,The 1970s was another mighty fine decade for science-fiction.,8,20 February 2017,"Nowadays, it's easy to suspect governments and big corporations of just about any nefarious doings. And there's a sinister plot afoot here to deal with an Earth of a future year (2022, just five years away in reality), where the ""greenhouse effect"" and over population have turned the planet into a portrait of Hell. For example, the opening text tells us that there are 40,000,000 people in NYC alone. A hard-driving NYPD detective, Thorn (Charlton Heston), stumbles onto something big when he investigates the murder of Simonson (Joseph Cotten), a corporation bigwig.Partly because this movie has been in the public consciousness for so long, it's hard to imagine many people not knowing what the story's big reveal is. You of course won't hear it from this viewer, but it's not hard to figure out. Still, the plot constructed by novelist Harry Harrison (originally titled ""Make Room! Make Room!"") is intriguing enough to pull you in, and keep you entertained. It might not be quite meaty or involved enough for some ""tastes"", mind you. Part of Thorn discovering the big secret involves our wrongdoers not seeming to go to great lengths to keep it hidden.One of the most impressive marvels is the use of extras, as MGM and director Richard Fleischer (of the classic Disney adaptation of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"") give us an amazing depiction of overcrowding. For instance, every day, on his way to work, Thorn has to clamber over dozens of bodies filling the corridors and stairways of his run down building. Excellent use is made of classical music, both pre-existing and new stuff composed by Fred Myrow (""Phantasm"").The cast is full of reliable, familiar actors: Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Paula Kelly, Stephen Young, Mike Henry, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Roy Jenson, Leonard Stone, Whit Bissell, Celia Lovsky, Dick Van Patten. Leigh Taylor-Young is beautiful and endearing as Shirl, a young woman living in a future where a young woman can be referred to as ""furniture"" and simply come with an apartment. Heston is solid as usual, but ""Soylent Green"" really belongs to the wonderful Edward G. Robinson, around 80 years old at the time and making his 101st feature film appearance. Sadly, it would turn out to be his last, making his final scenes even more poignant and powerful.This is definitely striking entertainment, even more when one considers the ending.Eight out of 10.",Soylent Green

21,zardoz-13,Food For Thought,7,20 October 2018,"Sluggish best describes ""Fantastic Voyage"" director Richard Fleischer's ""Soylent Green,"" a polished, but dystopian melodrama that combines a science-fiction premise with a police procedural murder-mystery adapted from the Harry Harrison novel ""Make Room! Make Room!"" Charlton Heston stars as Frank Thorn, a grubby but conscientious New York City Police detective, who hasn't had a hot shower in years. He never dons a uniform, so he looks more like an undercover cop. He shares a claustrophobic apartment with an elderly man Solomon ""Sol"" Roth (Edward G. Robinson of ""Little Caesar"") who serves as his 'book.' Meaning, in a metropolis laden with smog, overpopulation, and borderline energy resources, there aren't many who remember how to read, but Roth can, and he provides Thorn with all the information that he needs about his suspects. Incidentally, this was Robinson's farewell performance. Furthermore, sources say he passed away ten days later from cancer after shooting wrapped. ""Soylent Green"" takes place in the Big Apple in the year 2020, when civilization has disintegrated into a nightmare for all except the affluent wealthy. They reside in luxurious high-rise apartments, dine on the finest food and drink, while the less fortunate wither away beneath them in the streets, and survive minimally on a green wafer called Soylent. Soylent amounts to the fast food of the future, and it is manufactured from sea plankton. Being an NYPD carries few special privileges, so Thorn takes advantage of it while he can. When he investigates the murder that occurs early in the action, with a high-ranking official of the Soylent Corporation, William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton of ""Citizen Kane"") waiting to die willingly at the hands of his assailant, Thorn appropriates Simonson's 'furniture girl' Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young of ""The Big Bounce"") for some quick, consensual sex, spruced up with some rare bourbon. Thorn wears the same apparel throughout ""Soylent Green"" and uniform seems to be the order of the day for everybody else except the wealthy. Initially, Thorn suspected both Simonson's bodyguard, Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors of ""The Rifleman""), and Simonson's 'furniture' gal Shirl were the killers. Later, he confronts Gilbert (Stephen Young of ""The Thin Red Line"") in a crowd during a shoot-out, but he never proves that the latter killed Simonson. The brutality of Gilbert's murder of Simonson is tastefully staged so we never see Gilbert's blows connect with Simonson. We see Gilbert swing the instrument that kills Simonson but nothing more. The willingness of Simonson to submit to his death is haunting in itself. In a brief role that amounts to a cameo, Joseph Cotton is simply brilliant. The way that Simonson allows himself to die is similar but more painful to Roth's assisted suicide death toward the end of the film. Roth has simply given up on living and wants to bid life goodbye. Unfortunately, Fleischer never generates adequate momentum and ""Soylent Green"" grinds along and then ends surprisingly short at 97-minutes. The garbage collection trucks that have been equipped with scoops to scoop-up rioter is interesting, and there is a stupefying horror at the appearance of euthanasia centers that administer narcotic potions, put customers onto a dais where they watch on wrap-around screens the beauty of the world before the ecological catastrophe afflicted Earth. Not-surprisingly, there is little humor in this grim film. The ending qualifies this movie as a message picture, and ultimately food for thought. Poignant but predictable, ""Soylent Green"" qualifies as an above-average, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi epic. This Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film was nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation category, and it received 'the Golden Scroll' Award from Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA, in 1974.",Soylent Green

Earth is being overpopulated and there is a serious food shortage. On top of the the greenhouse effect has kicked in and the worlds temperature has risen some degrees. Electricity and running water are rare, so in other words, there's a shortage in basically everything we are so accustomed to. Life goes on but just not as it used to.""Soylent Green"" is not just a science-fiction movie but perhaps even more a cop movie, in which New York cop Robert Thorn, played by Charlton Heston, starts to investigate a murder on an corporate official of the Soylent company, the company that provides the world with it's mysterious new green food.As for the 'big twist' of the movie, without spoiling anything...The entire movie builds up to it and it becomes apparent from basically the first minute that this movie is going to have a twist in its story. Personally, the wasn't the powerful or shocking twist I had hoped for. Perhaps in a subconscious way it even was a bit predictable. Even though the twist is not weak and is definitely still good enough, it's just not the stuff featured in an early M. Night Shyamalan, to give an example.This movie made me realize that Charlton Heston was actually one of the earliest kings of science-fiction. In the late '60's and '70's science-fiction really wasn't a popular much watched genre. It certainly always wasn't the most respected genre to star in as an actor. Nevertheless Charlton Heston did this, despite getting more than enough movie offers to star in different movies, in more popular and higher respected genres. I guess he must had had some love for the genre, or perhaps it was because of the success and experience of working on ""Planet of the Apes"". He starred in some real great and significant genre movies in the '60's and '70's, of which this movie is also really one of them.Even though this movie is not as well known- it still can be called the ""Blade Runner"" of the '70's. It's clever and realistic enough and not afraid to show a depressing near future, with rotten and corrupt characters in it. I's a movie that's great in its details and little things, rather than really with its main plot-line or such.Of course the movie is also made great by it's performances. Charlton Heston got really great cast in his role and he's obviously in his element. It was also really great to see Edward G. Robinson in this. He was one of the greatest actors of the '40's and '30's, mostly playing tough gangster roles. He had to star in lots of crap after that in order to remain active in the business but it was great that he could end his career with a movie such as this one. He died days after he finished shooting on this movie. He was already seriously ill at the time of production and it was apparent that he had not long to life. Having never received even an Academy Award or even nomination for any of his great roles, he received posthumously an honorary award for his entire career in 1973. This movie was a role worthy last role for him and the movie features some great sequences, involving his character.Despite not being a special effects laden science-fiction movie, it's still a great looking one, with its costume design, sets and overall atmosphere. Some of the things still look futuristic, while others look as time hadn't stopped since the '70's. So it's an overall really great and original look that the movie has over it. It's a futuristic movie with an '70's atmosphere over it, what is there not to like?Great '70's science-fiction!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Soylent Green

26,The_Void,Nowhere near as good as it could have been,5,6 July 2006,"Maybe I'd just set my expectations too high, but I don't think it was unfounded to do so given all I'd heard about this film, and the fact that it's often regarded as a masterpiece of B-movie cinema. However, all I can rate Soylent Green as is a shame. I don't tend to rate seventies Sci-Fi very highly, and much of the reason for that is because the films often take place in a time that is now in the past. This one doesn't; and luckily, director Richard Fleischer also avoids the pitfall of showing too many out of date computers and technical equipment. However, while he was avoiding all these bad elements; he must have forgot to concentrate on the plot, and the result is a film that is really rather boring; despite the implications of the story and the huge chasm of substance that could have been made from it. The film is set in the year 2022, and New York has become grossly overpopulated. As you would expect, this is good for corporations; especially Soylent, a company making many foodstuffs - including the nutritious Soylent Green. However, a police officer ends up stumbling on the origin of the food while investigating a murder.I had an idea of what the 'sinister secret' behind Soylent Green might be before watching the film; and unfortunately, I was right. The central idea that the film revolves around is rather good, and the climax of the film is fast and exciting and works in spite of the obviousness of the final twist. However, while the build up to the ending is good; it never justifies the rest of the film, and a good final ten minutes doesn't account for a rather dull eighty that came before it. I've never been a fan of Charlton Heston and try my best to avoid his films. In fairness to the classic actor, he's actually not bad here, but his lack of charisma doesn't help. There are supporting roles for both Edward G. Robinson and Joseph Cotten, but neither one is particularly good. The style of the movie is undoubtedly its best element, and director Richard Fleischer does a very good job of ensuring that the film always feels bleak in the way that the future is presented. The cinematography benefits the style of the film also, as Fleischer implements several shots through a very dirty lens. Overall, this film has its positive elements; but there aren't enough of them and unfortunately I'll have to rate it as a failure.",Soylent Green

28,SimonJack,"A very good sci-fi film of its time, that hasn't come true",8,14 October 2021,"I first saw ""Soylent Green"" when it appeared way back then in theaters. It was an interesting and somewhat poignant sci-fi film and thriller for 1973. At that time, there still was some serious concern about the world running out of food. Well, the setting for the film - the year 2022, is just around the corner. The world is far from running out of food; but there still remain problems of distribution for some poorer countries. Nor will New York City have a population of 40 million next year. So, much of the sci-fi premise of this film has not come to pass.While the world's population will soon reach 9 billion, it will start to decline in the not too distant future. As of 2021, the projection among social scientists and others is that after the baby boomer generation (born roughly from 1946 to 1964) has died off, by mid-21st century, the world's population will turn around. From 2050 on, each decade will have a significant decline to the next century. During those years, there will be large-scale problems to deal with unlike any society has had to contend with before. The experts base the future population turnaround on the declining birthrates of the past few decades.Of course, much could happen before then. With the increasing wars around the world, growing terrorism and public violence in the Americas and Europe, population reduction policies of many nations, global climate changes and increasing natural disasters, future populations may even be much less than scientists now project. Anyone who's around to see the changes from 2050 on will be able to comment on the accuracy of the early 20th century projections. And, a movie fan or two of that future might pick up on these comments. Hmmm. One wonders if there would still be movies, or movie fans in the late 21st century.In the meantime, ""Soylent Green"" is a good sci-fi and action thriller, with a fine cast. The mystery that was the hallmark of promoting the film at the time isn't a mystery to audiences any longer. But, for any who haven't yet seen the film, I won't reveal it here.

31,sddavis63,Surprisingly Relevant With A Nice Twist At The End,7,23 November 2008,"If you're looking for a modern-type sci-fi movie with futuristic weapons blasting laser beams all around you'll be disappointed with Soylent Green. This isn't what this movie is about at all. On the other hand, it manages to combine a mildly interesting story with a pretty powerful twist at the end, and - although it was made 35 years ago - has a background to the story that makes the movie still relevant in 2008.Charlton Heston offered what I thought was a pretty typical Heston performance as Thorn, a police detective in the New York City of 2022 - a gritty, grimy, overpopulated mess of a city, where women are hired as ""furniture"" - essentially maids, cooks and sex partners assigned to apartments to be used by whoever has the money to live there, and where dead bodies are treated as nothing more than waste to be disposed of. The world in this era is suffering from ""the Greenhouse Effect"" - a 70's term that we today call ""global warming."" It's hot - all the time - and the world can't grow enough food and most animals have died off. The population is forced to live off mysterious foodstuffs called ""soylents"" - soylent red, soylent yellow and the newest rage - soylent green. They're tasteless and altogether unpalatable, but it's all that's available unless you're extremely rich, in which case you can afford $150 strawberries. Thorn becomes involved in investigating the murder of an executive with the soylent company, played by Joseph Cotten. Thorn becomes convinced it was an assassination, but the question is why anyone would want to assassinate him, and so we get drawn into a conspiracy story. Is it the government? The soylent company? Both? What's the big secret that led to this murder? The story admittedly proceeds rather slowly at times, but the mystery holds your attention, and when all is finally revealed at the end it turns out to be (to me at least) completely unexpected and somewhat disturbing. The movie also featured a nice performance from Edward G. Robinson as Thorn's assistant. Overall, it's pretty well done. 7/10",Soylent Green
32,ElMaruecan82,We'll get there... in a way or another...,8,13 April 2021,"""Soylent Green"" is one of these sci-fi movies that keep you thinking 'we'll get there' so that whatever negative reaction it elicits, that'll never be indifference. As for me, it became a certitude that Harry Harrison's prophetic vision of 2022 would come to reality sooner or later, and the opening credit sequences is a simple but effective-way to establish that the urban nightmare featured in the film is a logical continuation of the uncontrollable increase of the population.The fast-paced montage of photographs leaps over one century in less than three minutes, where stills of crowded streets in the Big Apple and highway spiderwebs, make pictures of vast landscapes as obsolete as the Dodo. And in that whirlpool of suicide-inducing images, some ought to catch the attention of a 2020's audience. ""Soylent Green"" might not have the wizardry arthouse feel of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" but a certain pandemic increased its significance. In this 2022 New York basking under clouds of yellow suffocation, people wear masks, need permits to circulate, ration cards to eat and can consider themselves lucky if they don't sleep on stairs.Even the least literate mind can feel the Orwellian vibes with corporations playing the Big Brother role, and we can forgive that 2022 looks oddly similar to the 70s and that digital technology didn't make much progress, but the merit of Richard Fleischer is not to aim too high so that the film can easily hit the target and makes its point, sparing us a lecture on Malthus theories about the regulations of population and the balance between demographics and food supplies. While the material calls for pessimism-driven analysis, the script written by Stanley Greenberg follows the usual patterns of detective stories with new layers revealed at the right time.And so we have alpha male Detective Frank Thorn, played by Charlton Heston and his partner and roommate Sol, Edward G. Robinson in his final role. Sol is an old man who age-wise represents the 70s audiences or any viewer for that matter, one who can recall a time where food was real, where fruits existed, where the fauna and flora of the planet weren't annihilated. He keeps rambling about them to an oblivious Frank just as then-audiences in the 70s heard stories about the Great Depression. Heston plays his Frank in sheer detachment, which is the right approach as someone for which this is the only 'reality', the catch is that like the vast majority of people, he doesn't know the secret about that reality.But whatever is to be discovered by Thorn is pending in the right order on the narrative's line, one we follow step by step. It starts when a big corporation executive named Samuelson (Joseph Cotton) is assassinated by a hitman and the murder is disguised as a botched burglary. The guilt-ridden victim knew his fate and didn't fight back. Frank is the one in charge and he handles the case rather cooly, thrilled by the opportunity to explore an upper apartment and bring back some trophies. He lets the bodyguard (Chuck Connors) file some red tape and then washes his head in the bathroom, takes a soap bar and admires the 'furniture' played by the beautiful Leigh Taylor-Young. The story warns us that in a time where necessity prevails, women's liberation would take many steps backwards.Frank brings back some real food from the house and later comes one of the most memorable movie eating scenes. What we see is a young man realizing what food is and one reminiscing about how it was. Think about it, what was the last time you went to a pub? The last time you could walk and breath without a mask? In these Covid-eras, we learned to value things, but we know they'll be back some day. Robinson's performance is integral to the power of that scene, every gulp, every drop he swallows gives a poignant dimension. In fact all the Heston-Robinson scenes are heightened by the subtext of their beautiful friendship, like in ""Double Indemnity"", Robinson can handle a manly 'I love you' without being a sap.Progressively, the film gets in the vicinity of these 70s paranoid conspiracy thrillers where a hunter becomes the hunted one. At that point of the review, there's no use to reveal the secret, let's just say that it became one of the most iconic quotes of American cinema and one that inspired a solution from Homer Simpson for overpopulation. The investigation in itself is rather formulaic and Fleischer doesn't have the right flair when it comes to handle action sequences, but the film is transcended by the Robinson's final scene, perhaps the most glorious swan song an actor ever had.The sequence is a classic: Sol, tired of all this nonsensical world, decides to go ""home"", he pick his favorite music, his favorite color (another scene parodied in ""The Simpsons"") and enjoys for the last time the sight of nature the way it used to be (in that nightmarish future, at least they kept the footage). Sol's eyes are filled with tears and so are Frank's. Knowing that Edward G. Robinson was dying of cancer, you can see these were genuine tears from the two actors and friends. Heston crying because he's bidding farewell to his friend, Frank's crying because he sees his friend dying or that world that is dead already, there's a whirlpool of tears induced by sights and sounds from Beethoven's symphony, culminating with a last ""I love you"" right before Gynt's morning music and a sunset illuminates the screen.That's a depiction of death that hasn't been equalled in any movie, as we see ourselves as part of the universe, embracing its eternal beauty before leaving. We'll get to that moment, but will that be as magnificent as Sol's departure? (perhaps the one moment of timelessness where ""Soylent Green"" came the closest to ""2001"").",Soylent Green
33,paul2001sw-1,Dated but pertinent,6,3 June 2007,"It's always fun watching old science fiction films with their curiously antiquated visions of the future: in the case of 'Soylent Green', who would have thought that the 21st century would look so like the 1970s? But put that aside, and its concerns of global warming, ocean depletion and processed foodstuffs seem very modern. What lets the film down are some more serious faults: the acting and special effects also appear dated (the false blood is some of the worst I've ever seen in the movies), the portrayal of women seems rooted in the misogyny of its own period, and the future world is not completely coherently realised, although I liked some details (the use of dumper trucks in riot control, for example). Ultimately, the truth behind the mystery turns out to be merely pragmatic and not that shocking, while the idea of a secret conspiracy is always less engaging than the alternative vision of a world where everybody knows what's really going on, but no-one speaks of it. The best treatment of similar material is of course 'Delicatessan', with its retro-aesthetic, offbeat humour, and subtle humanity.

The twist in the tale and the fact that the film marked the last screen appearance of Edward G Robinson, (he died soon after completing it), has earned it a certain celebrity amongst Science Fiction films and Robinson does lend it a touch of class it would otherwise have lacked, while the film's one great sequence is built around him.The plot involves policeman Charlton Heston, at his most wooden, investigating the murder of bigwig Joseph Cotton, a major player in the Soylent Corporation. Richard Fleischer was the director so you know that at least it's going to be a very professional job of work but perhaps its reputation is unnecessarily inflated.

35,ironhorse_iv,Soylent Green is a people movie! I ate it all up!,8,27 March 2013,"It's for the people to wake up and look at all the current issues, we're dealing with today! It's a scary movie that foreshadow a bleak Malthusian future if we don't do anything about it. This movie was made at a time when Paul Ehrlich's ""The Population Bomb"" was causing alarm throughout the academic and cultural elites in this country. Directed by Richard Fleischer, the film is a science fiction film noire. The meat of the story is that in 2022, the environment of the world has been nearly wipe out due to over population. Homeless people fill the streets and food is scarce; and most of the population survives on rations of Soylent Green produced by the Soylent Corporation. The food is believe to be high energy plankton, more nutritious and palatable than its predecessors Red and Yellow, but in short supply. The Soylent Company is running as all-time high, as the lack of a productive democratic government allows for a corporate take-over of the government, that become an unbalanced privatization, where increased profits are prioritized over the well-being of individuals and societies. Think of the Nazi regime and how they supplied corporations such as ThyssenKrupp with slave laborers. Here government also supplied the security forces for the Soylent Company with a special brand of fascism called corporatism. Still they have a thorn in their rose garden that trying to prick them. By Thorn, I meant Detective Thorn (Charleston Heston) who is investigating into the murder of a wealthy businessman in the Soylent Company, but what he finds might shock him and the world even more. Charleston Heston was great. There's a scene in an orphanage where Heston talks to a burnt out priest that is especially powerful. Based on Harry Harrison's book, ""Make Room! Make Room!"", the title was changed by the producers, who feared that audiences would confuse it with the Danny Thomas' TV series Make Room for Daddy. The word Soylent is supposed to suggest soybeans and lentils. New York City Police Department detective Robert Thorn lives with his aged friend Solomon ""Sol"" Roth (Edward G. Robertson), a former scholar who helps Thorn's investigations. Edward G. Robertson was amazing in this film as the funny and poignant cranky partner who constantly talks about the good old days. He really put it all on the line. See at the time, he was in very poor health with cancer, Edward was almost totally deaf when he made this movie, and only able to hear anyone if they spoke directly into his ear. His best performance was the scene where he was 'going home'. Charlton Heston was really crying because he was so moved by Edward G. Robinson's performance. Robinson knew he was dying from cancer and kept it from the cast and crew. He knew this would be his last film, and only Charlton Heston knew about the Cancer. Edward died just ten days after shooting wrapped. The music overture in that scene alone was beautiful and the beautiful shots of stock footage of nature felt nostalgia for a character that saw those natural landmarks disappears in his own eyes. Great use of classic music like Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the Pathetique. Follow up with Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony #6 The Pastoral and Morning from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite #1. This movie is very slow at times, but the big reveal, the payoff of the movie was pushed through pretty fast. I feel like I just wasted an hour and a half in some scenes. The ending scene is a still a big twist to those who haven't saw the movie, but it's never going to be a big enough surprised as it was in 1973. The DVD cover pretty much gives it away anyways. Plus, it's so out there, that most people who knows about the film, knows what Soylent Green before watching the film. Everyone by now knows the plot and the famous catch phrase. So the movie lose a lot of suspense, do to that. Still, Hannibal Lector would love the movie, Soylent Green. Dog eat Dog world just became people eat Soylent Green world. This movie is just amazing with its message. I just wish it had more technology or futuristic sets. The sets look like cardboard and the effects are primitive. In one scene a woman plays a ""modern"" video game that looks like first generation Missile Command. The movie can be a bit sexist, as women in the film are wooden characters just there for eye candy and the random sex scene. Perhaps we should just educate the women and make condoms in surplus. Educated women usually have fewer children and the availability of condoms will allow people to control their reproductive cycles. Just an idea. Anyone who has taken the time to research will find out the scenarios portrayed in that book know that something isn't right. Instead of mass starvation, we have a crisis in obesity in much of the world. The famines we have are largely human-engineered, the result of war and population displacement. It is ludicrous to believe New York City or any other place in 2022 will look anything remotely like it does in Soylent Green, but it's still possible. Still, the demographics are a little off as, amongst the hoards of milling masses are nearly all white. Wouldn't the largest amounts of people be Asian or Hispanic? Shouldn't the movie be call El Soylent Verde? The movie is dated, but 'Soylent Green' has always been a favorite of mine. I love it. Pick up a copy of the film and treat yourself. Definitely worth a purchase! Enjoy!",Soylent Green
36,sol-,My brief review of the film,5,10 September 2005,"In many regards not much different and no better than the average science fiction film with a dire dystopian warning, ideas of overpopulation and lack of food that it brings up are not at all original, and when the source of the artificial title food finally is revealed, it is done in a far too literal fashion, with the answer obvious at least fifteen minutes before the film announces it. There are a number of messily filmed scenes too, done in a dreary, frantic style and the characters are acting barely rise above the ordinary. To its credit however, the film manages to be rather intriguing, other than in the final few minutes, and it effectively uses close-ups to provide an overcrowded feeling. Taylor-Young looks appropriately sumptuous too, but this is not really much better than average of its type, and the solution to the origins of the food do hardly matter, as the people are so desperate that they would eat pretty much anything, so would anyone care? It has some good moments and is relatively engaging, so I do not really want to keep pinpointing the film's negative bits, but there is a substantial amount of bad stuff surrounding what is good here.",Soylent Green
37,Dr_Coulardeau,The shorter the better the classicker,9,12 January 2009,"This science fiction is typical of a whole period, the very period after 1968. It was the time when the hippies died at the end of Hair, when the flower boys and girls departed at the end of Fritz the cat or Alice's Restaurant, when the Vietnam war became very ugly in Zabriskie Point, when the lying president was going to be re-elected for him to be resigned by Congress just one year later and buried by Jimi Hendrix in Woodstock. This film is just the testament of that dying world. And it invented the mad cow disease just thirty years before: use dead human carcasses to feed the living and you will make that humanity degenerate so fast that there will be no crowded cities for long. It is the end of a period and nothing else and there is absolutely not one single ounce of future in that science fiction.

38,poe426,Once ahead of its time...,10,8 May 2012,"Charlton Heston was on the front lines of the Civil rights movement in this country, so it came as no surprise that the four science fiction films he starred in in the late 60s and early 70s (PLANET OF THE APES, BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE OMEGA MAN, and SOYLENT GREEN) all dealt with Real World problems- everything from Nuclear Armageddon and Biological Warfare to Overpopulation and Man's inhumanity to Man. With the greatest man-made catastrophe in history (the Gulf oil spill) now giving us mutated shrimp born without eyes and crabs and lobsters whose limbs literally fall off when they're picked up, and with Japan's nuclear meltdown(s) spreading detectable radiation to the East Coast of the United $tates (not to mention all those nuclear ""tests"" that may well have had something to do with the onset of Global Warming), SOYLENT GREEN is (unfortunately) more timely than ever.

He provides an earnestness and credibility to the role and therefore the story.Yet another warning movie about a diabolical future unless we take heed.

41,Vartiainen,But what about Soylent Red?,8,19 August 2017,"It's the year 2022 and the world has fallen into chaos. Greenhouse gases have lead to widespread global warming, overpopulation and the fall of living standards. Humanity has to survive with the food they manage scrape together from the oceans and waste heaps. Enter the Soylent Corporation, the foremost provider of foodstuff.The film follows a corrupt cop named Frank Thorn (Charlton Heston), who investigates the death of William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten), one of the wealthiest men in the nation. In the process we explore the world of Soylent and ponder the mysteries of just how much we're filling to bend for such basic commodities such as food or shower or soft bed.One of the people laying the theme thick on you is Thorn's roommate and investigative partner Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson), a man old enough to remember the good old days when you could eat red meat, drink beer and not worry about the sun burning the skin right off your bones. Very nice role and the one with the best scenes in the film.As a whole the film is a nostalgic cult classic from the 70s. The themes and problems have certain patina to them, but at the same time they're closer to us than they've ever been. It's only five years to the events of this film and while we're not quite there, thankfully, the situation hasn't exactly improved since the 70s.Well worth a watch for fans of older science fiction. Good characters, interesting world and that end twist. It's hard to ask for more.",Soylent Green
42,hellraiser7,"No More Room, No More Hope",8,14 January 2014,"Despite how much progress we make throughout the years, unfortunately we seem to also create just as many more new problems than the ones solved. This is a sci-fi classic that I really like that I still feel is relevant to this day.The film I don't feel is perfect. The pacing is really slow and not much really happens which makes the film not the most exciting to watch. And the post apocalyptic world isn't fully explored probably due to budget limitations. Though these are things I can get past.I'll admit this is a really disturbing post apocalyptic story because by today's standards I feel it's frighteningly plausible, because we're getting dangerously close. We see a world where humans have really fraked up bad, the earth is now one big crap hole, it is dirty, grimy, and there is so much smog and heat. Theweather literally really changes, there's hardly any sun since the smog has blocked it out of sight, nor does the climate change much.Resouces are at a all time low, you can still buy food but it's not always of great quality. Even books, paper, and writing materials are rare and almost depleted; a world without books and writing that's truly is a scary thought. But the worst part we see left and right the world is just filled with people everywhere you look and walk that is if there's any space to walk.It's true despite the fact this film takes place in the far future, they do really have much high tech. But when you think about it more it makes sense, since the world is devoid of natural resources you would have to resort to simply whatever works or what you currently got, in this world it's practically jack squat.I like the characters Thorn (Chaleton Heston) and Sol played brilliantly by Edward G Robertson, on a side note this was his last film, which made the final scene with him all the more sadder. Anyway I really like the back and forth, between them which I feel really helps drive the film. The dynamic between them is almost like a father and son as we see Sol is the one filled with wisdom of the past and trying to fill Thorn's curiosity with it. I really like how we see each of them react toward certain everyday things we take for granted. Like seeing Thorn turn on a facet of water or smelling soap. Or even one moment when Thorn shows Sol a slab of meat, Sol cries and says ""How did we come to this."" Those little scenes I'll admit just made me grateful that I still have grocery stores with plenty to buy and eat, I have bathrooms, I can still play video games, read books and anything else. It just goes to show how truly awful the fraked up world really is because it takes those luxuries and privileges from us away forever.The suspense is solid and the mystery of the Soylant Green resources is intriguing. There are some solid suspenseful sequences, my favorite and I'll admit disturbing at the same time was Thorn chasing down an assassin during a food riot, which I felt was intense in a way. Not just from the problem at hand, Thorn had to deal with but just the amount of chaos around him. And seeing the dump trucks scoop up people and dump them, we see that there is a loss of respect for human life that human values have been thrown into the garbage.What really disturbs me the most about the film is just the sense of hopelessness the world has. There are two scenes that parallel the theme, as we see a worn out priest that is suppose to be a deliver of hop but has lost hope himself with his Church overcrowded. As well as a scene where Sol interacts with the book keepers and one of them says, ""What God, where is he."" I'll admit hear that gave me a cold feeling, it shows once again how much this apocalyptic world has taken the most precious resource of all hope.And once we discover the secret of the Soylant food source, we see another precious thing it's taken away which is humanity. Sure in a way it can be seen as a solution but you are still committing a crime against humanity.The message of the film is to simply take action now. We have to take better care of ourselves and the Earth, because once the Earth goes down the tube, we go with it.Overall, this is a solid sci-fi classic that I feel is worth a watch. Appreaciate what you have on this Earth right now and protect it with all of your might, tomorrows are in short supply in a world with no room and no hope.Rating: 3 stars",Soylent Green

In this final movie for legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, ""Solent Green"" becomes a landmark classic. Many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history. The movie is taken from the novel entitled, 'Make room, make room' but who's working title was changed to ""Solent Green."" The story concerns the Earth as it evolves into the future with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing short of Catastrophic.

However there are those who know the 'real' ingredient in Solent Green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution. The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). Upon his death, a dedicated police detective called Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes all the way to the top, it begins with Simonsons' Bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Security chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson) who target Thorn for a Waste Desposal Factory.

44,Polaris_DiB,"Despite famous twist, STILL amazing movie",10,5 August 2011,"I actually find this movie to be very believable. Fleischer really wows me with his eye for details, small things that illicit quite good responses in the narrative. In Tora, Tora, Tora , he successfully details the minutia of the thinking that went on behind this unknown-to-the-characters attack, in a way that helps the already-knowing audience how the historical people really felt. I think it's great that Soylent Green works the same way, where you can know all about how it's made of people and yet the reveal still illicits surprise and dismay.In this case, also, there's a sort of working backward effect to it. Charlton Heston has something great going for him in post-Apocalypse narratives (whereas his historical epics not) but this is more reserved, and the scene where he is enjoying a feast with Sal makes you really feel the absence of the food in their regular lives. The riot police wearing football helmets actually makes sense—all this sports equipment lying around, no more interest in sports, no more money for riot gear. The simplest smallest details really stand out, both in the detail of the world and how to achieve good results without a big budget for special effects.Meanwhile, I am impressed how daring the gender politics are in this because actually, this vision is believable, and it is horrible, and it would have been (and probably was) easy for the movie to be misconstrued. In an arena of exhausted resources and overpopulation I can totally believe in the rich using women for life as ""furniture"". It really works great that the whole humanitarian principle behind the ""Oh noes, we're eating ourselves!"" is so shocking to a character completely comfortable with using women as furniture. The movie walks a thin line between empathy and concern for its characters (successful) and realization that even what they are comfortable with is horrifying to our current perspective (also successful).Then there's the introductory titles, Sal's retirement chamber, and the closing sequence. Fleischer extends a bit into the experimental and the effect is riveting. For instance, in the retirement chamber, the almost commercial over-indulgence in nature cinematography becomes less a commercial for Pfizer and more an aching remembrance of times past—but it's created by a company that might well be the future of Pfizer. It's a past that is gone and also never existed anyway. It's the past they want to believe in AND have nostalgia for AND never experienced, not knowing that it didn't really look quite like that. However, it also informs to the audience what we're losing. It's still a commercial of good meaning, pointing out cinematographically what we don't look at now.The bookending titles work in roughly the same way with opposite values. The opening sequence is a masterful montage of human development paced to human development. Slow steps become leaps become exponential growths as the cuts get faster and faster and more overwhelming. The closing sequence is repeated imagery from Sal's chamber, now shown as something not achieved—something out of reach. With these two statements, Fleischer points out it's already too late.This is a movie that also operates scene-by-scene. The overarching investigation narrative certainly helps to draw the movie together but it's amazing how distinct little vignettes appear throughout the movie. The introductory sequence of Sal and Thorn and how it's lit to look like their space is lit only by a single bulb, and the careful detail of how these two men live so close together and don't get on their nerves—and then are later revealed to basically be living a decent ""middle class life"" amongst the masses literally massed on stairways the furniture party the strawberries. These things lead to the idea that there are stories going on beyond our vision that we just don't have the time or power to be able to perceive. It's almost possible to imagine actually a separate reveal where the world ISN'T so overcrowded and only the people of New York have been trapped in a rat cage if only we could look further.Anyway, this far beats Omega Man and Planet of the Apes, and I qualify those three in that order, Soylent Green first.--PoalrisDiB",Soylent Green
45,strong-122-478885,... And Soylent Green's #1 Ingredient Was What!!??,2,16 December 2014,"Set in the future of 2022 (which seemed to be suspiciously deprived of technology's gadgetry) - Soylent Green (from 1973) was such a laughable piece of frivolous, Sci-Fi junk that it really should have been billed as a two-bit comedy.When it came to the likes of genuine suspense and drama, to me, Soylent Green was about on par with that of a typical Care Bear cartoon.With its story taking place in a (supposedly) over-crowded NYC of 40 million, this ridiculous, low-budget movie contained so many ""empty street"" scenes that the viewer would have to be a totally clueless, ""hee-haw"" hillbilly to believe that this city's population exceeded more than, say, 50 people, tops.Oh, yes. And, speaking about Charlton Heston (and his phony-looking hairpiece), believe me, this total slug-of-an-actor was clearly too old for his part at age 50.Heston unconvincingly played Detective Thorn, a stud-muffin, who (as an apparently trustworthy law-enforcer) regularly stole valuables from crime sites and freely entered people's homes, ruthlessly conducting extensive searches without any warrant.If I'm really expected to believe that the producers of this production actually cared about the world's present state of mass pollution and over-population, then they sure fooled me.I found this so-called ""Message Movie"", and its message, to be such a completely hypocritical contradiction that I'm convinced that the greedy, little production company who produced this picture was only interested in one thing - And that was - Making themselves (and their stars) a whole pile of money - And the rest of the world be damned!",Soylent Green

There's a lot of moral ambiguity here about WHO needs to be stopped, and why. SOYLENT GREEN states explicitly that 40 million folks live in New York City in the year 2022, and many more than half of them are on some sort of welfare. Obviously, the reproduction rate there is several times greater than the most prolific refugee camp of today, despite that fact that the movie shows most people sleep on top of each other in stairwells. (They must mate by osmosis, as no one seems to shed their clothes for ANY reason in 2022--not even the food stock!). Even the richest people lead undesirable lives then. For them, a tomato is a rare treat, electricity is an occasional luxury, and their video games are simply variations on Pong! (If you don't recall Pong, it's listed between ""marbles"" and ""yo-yo's"" in the Guide to Ancient Games of Yesteryear.) When you crunch the numbers mentioned by Thorn's supervisor of roughly 200 murders daily in their Precinct 14 and multiply by at least that number of city neighborhoods, the Big Apple's annual murder rate has risen to one million plus in SOYLENT GREEN days. Thousands more citizens are ""scooped"" into oblivion via garbage trucks during daily food riots. Obitoriums scattered throughout the city allow depressed geezers to drink poisoned Kool-Aid and enjoy 20-minute musical send-offs. Since cops and human body ""recyclers"" seem to be the only people with jobs, it's amazing that it takes Charlton Heston's ""Thorn"" character an entire movie to realize that ""Soylent Green is people!"" This whole premise is a cheap rip-off from an Anthony Burgess novel, THE WANTING SEED. Only there ""Soylent Green"" is called ""bully"" (which sounds more nourishing).

I considered it to be close to Planet of the Apes in quality; a fantastic story and film that had to find ways to work around its limitations. The weakest moments are due to Heston's hammy acting and weak fight choreography but it's about average for the era. Despite Heston's limitations as an actor, he sure knows how to scream a memorable ending line. This is Robinson's last fill, and knowing that, his death scene hits much harder.",Soylent Green

All we see here is a 2022 that resembles a poor man's 1970's. No special effort has been made to make this look even remotely futuristic. There are no special effects evident.Charlton Heston surprises us with his appearance in a film such as this, as does the enjoyable Edward G.

51,dworldeater,Absolute classic and essential sci fi starring the legendary Charlton Heston,10,5 January 2017,"Soylent Green is an excellent dystopian science fiction classic starring Charlton Heston. Along with Planet Of The Apes and The Omega Man, Soylent Green is in the same vein and is very entertaining, cerebral and well made all around. This very bleak, but socially relevant and thought provoking film is a cautionary tale that is grounded in scientific fact and where we could be headed if we don't make drastic changes. The year is 2022 and is set in NYC, where it is overcrowded, polluted and resources such as food and water are scarce. Charlton Heston is a police detective that is investigating a murder, which leads him to uncover some disturbing facts that are trying to be buried by The Soylent Corporation, who is a primary food source and distributor to the majority of the population worldwide. Leigh Taylor Young is ""furniture"", owned by the building and her job is to please her wealthy male tenants, while getting to live a life far more comfortable than most people could dream of as her reward for her services. Her husband/tenant was murdered and ends up being love interest for our leading man Heston. Heston, was a lucky man and Leigh Taylor Young was gorgeous. This was the final film for screen legend Edward G Robinson and had a great rapport and chemistry with Heston. The film is gritty and grimy and paints a nightmare picture of the future. Richard Fleisher did his best work with this film and is a great sci fi thriller with lots of social commentary and suspense. Soylent Green is an absolute classic and is every bit as good and as important as the original Planet Of The Apes.",Soylent Green
52,ferbs54,Doesn't At All Live Up To Its Source Novel,6,25 October 2007,"In Harry Harrison's classic 1966 sci-fi novel ""Make Room! Make Room!,"" a Chinese street kid named Billy Chung kills a racketeer in the overpopulated NYC of 1999 and is hunted down by cop Andy Rusch, who lives with his senior citizen roommate, Sol Kahn. By the time this story reached the big screen seven years later, it had been retitled ""Soylent Green"" and the entire Billy Chung storyline had been scrapped. Instead, the murder victim is one of the execs on the Soylent board (Joseph Cotten, wasted in a teeny role) and the crime is investigated by a cop named Thorn (Charlton Heston), who lives in the overpopulated NYC of 2022 with his aged roommate, Sol Roth. (Why the screenwriters insisted on these name changes is beyond me!) While Harrison's novel's main goal was depicting the problems of an overpopulated Earth of the future, with a crime as the background element, the film reverses that thrust unwisely, dealing only cursorily with the larger issue. Thus, we get nowhere near the sense of the problem that the novel gives us. As in the book, our cop hero gets involved with the slain man's girlfriend, Shirl, here presented as what's known as ""Furniture""; a beautiful, sexually available woman who comes standard with your apartment. (Actually, I kinda go for that idea!) The best part of the film, far and away, is Edward G. Robinson (Sol), here in the 101st and final film of his glorious career. He is the heart and soul of the film, and the picture's best scenes are always the ones showing him reminiscing about the ""old days"" or, with Heston, enjoying some superrare booze, beef, strawberries or soap; the two really do make us sense how rare these commodities have become. The ultimate secret of Soylent Green the product is one that everybody by now knows, and is a sensational element not at all present in the book. Bottom line: This is a decent, fun-to-watch movie, not terribly impressive, that does not live up to its source.",Soylent Green
53,ShootingShark,"Exciting, Scary, Thought-Provoking Environmental Collapse Sci-Fi Thriller",7,21 August 2005,"In the year 2022 the Earth is in environmental decline and overpopulation and food shortages are rife. A New York cop investigating the murder of one of the directors of the powerful Soylent soya-manufacturing corporation smells a rat when unknown political elements attempt to have the case closed. Digging deeper, he uncovers a terrible secret about Soylent's food products ...Based on Harry Harrison's brilliant novel Make Room! Make Room!, this is one of several great seventies dystopian science-fiction nightmares, and possibly the most grim and unrelenting in its portrayal of a world gone mad. Whilst the murder investigation and the shock finale are handled well, the film is much more interested in its depiction of the effects of overpopulation and the rape of the environment. Manhattan has a population of forty million and poverty, filth and rubbish are everywhere. Marriage seems to be redundant and women are largely decorative objects to be bought and sold like furniture. There is massive inflation and unemployment. Fresh food is unheard of, as are books and papers. Voluntary euthanasia is encouraged. The main job of the police is to quell riots when supplies run out, by scooping up the crowds with rubbish trucks. The film is beautifully directed, with superb photography by Richard H. Kline, for maximum jarring impact; the exterior daytime scenes were shot with filters to give the air a dusty, poisoned look. There are several brilliant set-pieces, such as the opening photo-montage and the stunning sequence where Robinson ""goes home"". The cast are all good - Heston walks a razor-line between moral hero and greedy opportunist, and Robinson (in his last role) steals the show as the only character who remembers the beauty of the world - but not people - before the insanity.

54,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Soylent Green (1973),7,13 December 2011,"A dark and disturbing look at a future that may surface, though hopefully not in the next 11 years as the film suggests. Heston is a police officer in an overcrowded world. Food is but a luxury as people are fed Soylent products. There's a wonderful scene in which Heston steals a number of items from the home of a murder victim. They are common everyday things, but the film creates such an emotional intensity about them, Robinson breaks down into tears at the thought of meat. Taylor-Young plays one of the most tragic love interests in cinematic history. She's referred to as ""furniture"" as she comes with the apartment, a choice of living for many attractive women, as they get to live with the wealthy and experience rare items. Looking through time, this is something that rings true on a terrifying scale. Like many of Heston's pieces, it mixes B-Movie charm with social commentary. Many will know the twist, as did I, but when the final line of dialog rings out it really shocks.",Soylent Green

57,screenman,Still A Worthy Watch,7,3 September 2011,"The 1970's was a curious decade. Movies from that period have a particular 'look' that's hard to define but quite clearly dates them. 'Soylent green' is no exception. Yet despite having aged, there are still plenty of details to admire in this work.Charlton Heston, who risked typecasting so many futureshock movies did he make, plays policeman Thorn. His beat is a world in which the population has grown without let, resources are diminished and the environment ruined. Global warming has set in. It's always hot. Edward G Robinson plays Sol, his ageing assistant. They share a cheap, shabby apartment. Sol works as researcher, records-clerk and general dog's-body. There is great chemistry between these two old Hollywood pros. They're a pleasure to watch and hear.Thorn is as ready to loot a crime-scene as investigate it. He's not bad. Times are hard and every little helps. Some wealthy bigwig is murdered. And as well as a curious case to solve there's choice pickings to be lifted, including soap, booze and real beefsteak. The investigation takes an unusual turn, ultimately throwing up a very grisly discovery.Most of this movie still stands-up to the test of time. Yes; it is blatantly 70's but the starring leads and a host of interesting issues and details still make for a very entertaining watch. If I have a grumble, it is that the investigation was a tad too formulaic. I would have liked to see a few more twists and turns with a sudden shock or two leading up to the final denouement. Like the later and much more lavish 'Blade Runner' a basic story in spread pretty thinly and packed-out with detail instead. 'Soylent Green' still has a lot more believable plot, though.",Soylent Green

A police detective investigates the murder of an executive at a rations manufacturer and begins to make real progress until the governor mysteriously pulls the plug. But the detective launches his own investigation. The concept of this story is interesting: an overpopulated earth and a highly civilised society copes with food shortage and civil unrest and resorts to drastic measures. Alas, it suffers from not giving us enough scale for what it promises: a future world with enormous difficulties. Not enough is given over to a sense of space and imagined futuristic locations, and so instead we have a standard detective story of an archetypal cop, drab fistfights, occasional shootouts, and small apartment melodrama. Heston's frame and acting has presence provides distraction, and Edward G Robinson provides good but brief support. Some scenes are sublime, including the visual montage sequence at the 'departure' lounge. The art direction detail seems a bit dated now, in the same way as A Clockwork Orange, but the matte special effects of New York skyline are effective. All in all, a striking sci-fi flick with a good soundrack.",Soylent Green
60,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"A Timeless Film, Disturbing but also Highly Possible",10,6 September 2014,"Despite the industrial factories shown in rapid succession in the intro of this film, Soylent Green is not a preachy hippie propaganda film overloaded with environmental messages. The pollution is just part of the scenery. No, industrialization is not the theme, nor is cannibalism, contrary to popular belief. Soylent Green's timeless theme is the increasing disregard for human life. A lot of people have forgotten Soylent Green under bad successors like the Hunger Games and Divergent, which is incredibly disappointing and sad. Soylent Green is a film that will never get old. It does have elements of 1970's music but this music goes along perfectly with the entire film. And let's take a glance at the very possible world depicted in Soylent Green; this world is overpopulated heavily and food is no longer 'real', just bizarre dried-up rations made by the controlling Soylent Corporation. In this world feminism is a thing of the past, women are readily available to men as live-in prostitutes referred to commonly as 'furniture', and despite some kind men only keeping these women around for companionship in this depressing place, many men are allowed to severely beat their furniture and treat them as objects and sex toys. There is an assisted suicide clinic, mainly since in this bleak world nobody has worth anymore. Thousands of forlorn and miserable people can be put down like an animal in a time frame of twenty minutes. There are no funerals, no cremation either, all bodies are carried off to garbage dumps outside the city.Within this strange and hollow world a detective, Thorne, resides in a small apartment with his elderly friend, Sol. Thorne was born without ever seeing a tree or an animal, born eating freeze-dried cubes of foodstuff and born without books, so he often scoffs at Sol's longing for the past, when food was grown in gardens or butcher shops and not in a laboratory, and when books were mass-produced rather than fake food. Both are very good friends and despite their differences make a great team.One night, during Thorne's night shift, he is assigned to solve a case in a rich suburb area of the city, where a wealthy businessman was whacked to death in the head by a supposed punk burglar wielding a meat-hook as a weapon. This businessman, Simonson, has a bodyguard (Mr. Fielding), and furniture (Shirl). Shirl claims she was very happy with him and that she misses him a great deal, but has very little time to grieve the loss of her companion. His body is shipped off to a waste disposal plant on the secluded outskirts of the city. Thorne questions her and learns that Simonson was extremely depressed before his murder, and that he cried a lot. Thorne comes to believe that the murder was an assassination and that Fielding is involved. While investigating the case, he is able to enjoy the luxuries never available to him in life, such as running water, fresh food, paper, soap and pencils. Sol is overjoyed by the items Thorne sneaks back to the apartment for him, including two large hardcover volumes of the Soylent Corporation Demographic Reports. Thorne gets Sol to read them and learn if what upset Simonson is within the books.While investigating the case, Thorne becomes pursued by an assassin, the same man who murdered Simonson. Sol reads the two books and discovers a very disturbing secret, then pays to 'go home', which is the friendly codename for the assisted suicide clinic. Thorne rushes to be with his dying friend, and while there witnesses the scenic nature from the past that he never believed really existed, all in video clips on a large projector Sol is watching. Sol starts getting delirious but convinces Thorne to follow the waste disposal trucks to the secluded factory where the bodies of the dead are sent. It is there where Thorne learns of what is in the Soylent Green that everybody has been eating people. Disgusted and horrified, he narrowly escapes and calls Shirl, who he has developed a relationship with. He tells her to stay with her new 'owner' forever, then calls his boss and pleads for help, right before he is assassinated himself in an overcrowded church. Bleeding to death, he does the last thing he can do, and that is to shout out, ""Soylent Green is people! We have to stop them somehow""I think the saddest part of this film was that the actor who played Sol was dying of cancer during filming. When Thorne (Charlton Heston), was crying in the assisted suicide clinic, it wasn't a staged performance, he was sad that this man was never going to see the amazing performance on-screen. 12 days afterwords, Sol's actor died of cancer. He never got so see Soylent Green. The acting was excellent, emotional but still not too dramatic, except when it was really needed. The soundtrack was amazing, the entire plot was disturbing yet original and eye-opening. When people ask me what the scariest film I ever saw was, they expect me to list a slasher film, but I always say Soylent Green. In real-life, the quick disregard for human life is becoming less of a fantasy and more of a reality, as overpopulated Third-World countries are exploited by more developed nations, as many obese people in America become regarded as just McDonald's-eating nothings, as people with autism or mental health issues are just prescribed a pill to make them less of a burden to society, it's horrible. And we have fast food companies quickly pushing out cheap food humans are no longer even valuing themselves as much how has this type of thing been happening? Soylent Green has sounded the alarm, hopefully the world hears it in time.I also recommend The Omega Man, Logan's Run, Dawn of the Dead (the original 1977 one not the remake), and The Great Global Warming Swindle, if you're a fan of Soylent Green.",Soylent Green
61,wisewebwoman,The Future is Just About Here.,7,1 March 2008,"I saw this film again tonight and am currently and coincidentally reading ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"", a book about the industrialization of food by three giant agri-business corporations. I find this third viewing of the film even more chilling than the first two times. We are currently dependent on just about two products, oil and corn, and if these commodities collapse, what are we left with? This film goes there. The after-affects of the environmental poisoning of the planet, both by overpopulation and the rape of finite resources is starkly presented here.One can feel the eternal blistering heat of New York here and never has there been a more frightening delineation of the lives of the rich and the poor. There is no middle class. Women are commodities and referred to as furniture that are rented out along with the expensive apartments that contain them.Charlton Heston, playing Thorn, and as stiff and wooden as he always is, is an NYPD detective who lives with an older man, Edward G. Robinson, in a relationship that is never explained though they tell each other they love one another. This is EGR's last film and it is a poignant performance. Thorn is taxed with solving the murder of Simonson, played by Joseph Cotten. Simonson is the head of the Soylent Corporation, a corporate monopoly which supplies the food for the poor - wafers in assorted colours. The latest product is Soylent Green.The investigation finds the armed and dangerous Charlton Heston on the loose, following all the leads and finding the secret at the heart of the film, the horrific truth about what the Soylent Corporation uses for its wafers.The film is amazingly prescient in the foretelling of how food will be completely industrialized to the point of a completely depleted planet and the overcrowding of every square inch of livable space.Leigh Taylor-Young, playing Shirl, charms in a tricky role as does the brief appearance by Joseph Cotton.I thought Charlton Heston was miscast in the role of the detective and more could have been made of the developing sub-plot between himself and Shirl.7 out of 10 for a film remarkably current..",Soylent Green

63,Maciste_Brother,Unforgettable story but the film is too short,7,19 June 2007,"The concept and story for SG are unforgettable and groundbreaking for a Hollywood studio production: it's very bleak in its presentation of the world in the near future, sorta ahead of its time regarding the environment (green-house effects) and one of a kind, as there wasn't any other film like this made by a major since then. Seeing the MGM logo at the beginning made me wonder what the studio who brought us musicals were thinking. Yes, MGM did release 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY 5 years before SG but this story is so bleak and depressing compared to 2001, which was already pretty bleak in its own way that I really wonder who greenlighted this. Producers were probably trying to find the next big sci-fi vehicle for Charlton Heston, who had a massive hit with PLANET OF THE APES. But as harsh as PLANET OF THE APES was, it doesn't even come close to SG. And even it's obvious producers were looking for a science fiction story with a surprise ending that would top the one in POTA, which they achieved with SG but they sorta went to a certain extreme, certainly for a mainstream film. When you consider that SNL were still making fun of the ending of SOYLENT GREEN back in the 1990s, you know the film made an impact.After looking at the recent DVD, I have to say that the treatment of the groundbreaking story is hopelessly outdated. Who knew the 2022 would look so much like the 1970s. Aside from the obvious anachronisms, there are many other problems with the film: if the population is feed only soylent food, why were there so many different sized people? If an entire population lives on the same diet, everyone, and I mean everyone would have the same body type. Edward G. Robinson, god bless his soul, didn't look like someone who lived only off of soylent green. Details like this is were the film falters. It offers a great story but conceptually, it hardly tries to flesh it out. The other big problem is the length. At 97 minutes, SOYLENT GREEN is one of those films when I wish it was actually longer, actually a bit more time spent going over the many layers of socio/political/environmental consequences of the story. The film needed an extra 20 minutes to cover all the fascinating concepts it came up with but hardly elaborated upon. Instead , the film spent too much time on the crime storyline, which is pretty weak and the resolution is not even the result of the murder: Heston discovers the secret of soylent green not because of the case he was working on but because of Sol going ""home"".But even with all these faults, SOYLENT GREEN is a must see science fiction film. Like I already said, it's a one of kind story considering it came from Hollywood and the story is still relevant today, probably even more so today. I enjoyed watching it even though I wish there was more. More details about the chaotic world. More environmental moments. More ""scoop"" moments. More bleakness.",Soylent Green
64,Cosmoeticadotcom,Solid,7,18 September 2008,"In terms of the arts, the 1970s were a very turbulent era. In literature and the visual arts, it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted. In music it was a decade that many see as a low point, due to corporate rock and disco. On television it was a Golden Age for situation comedies, from The Odd Couple to the Mary Tyler Moore Show to M*A*S*H to All In The Family, but in film it was even a greater period of creativity, in all genres, that saw the rise of the American auteur- directors like Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese- from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated Hollywood for over half a century. These directors wanted to craft literate, arts films for the masses, of the sort that had been staples in Europe since the end of the Second World War. Yet, the studios were trying to keep pace, with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s.But, unlike the films of the 1930s, starring actors like Jimmy Cagney and John Garfield (usually co-starring the Dead End Kids), that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way, or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage, the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films, which allowed the Left Wing of Hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment. There was precedent for this approach, for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the McCarthy era- most notably The Day The Earth Stood Still and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. And the early 1960s saw Rod Serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show The Twilight Zone. Among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive Silent Running; George Lucas's first film THX 1138, which dealt with consumerism, group think, and existentialism; and Logan's Run, which hammered away at Communism and state control versus the rights of an individual. Some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded- and reek of the then current Arab oil crisis and rampant inflation. A few jarred strawberries cost $150, and Soylent rations its assorted colored foods- Soylent Yellow, Soylent Red, and the new Soylent Green, reputedly made from 'the finest undersea growth,' in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time. Scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release, and the scenes of crowding, and bodies, live and dead, lying all about are still chilling, as well as influential. A later film like Escape From New York is an obvious progeny. The rest of the script, by Stanley R. Greenberg, however, is rather pedestrian, and fairly standard for a dystopian flick, but Fleischer and cinematographer Richard H. Kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds, to spice things up. The use of soft, dimly lit visuals, murkily filtered, add a Stygian feel to the New York of the film, almost like a colorized version of Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr. The only light in the film comes from artificial sources, and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless.The end of the film, where Thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into Soylent Green wafers, is both chilling, and oddly drama-less. In the end, the Soylent minions hunt Thorn down, but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to Chief Hatcher. Yet, one does not know if it is enough, for Hatcher has already been co-opted, and has a track record of taking the easy way out. Yet, that fact, and its ambiguity, shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters' dilemmas, and has a depth many later, better made films, sci fi or not, do not have. It is also why Soylent Green is still a film worth watching.",Soylent Green
65,hall895,Soylent Green is tasty,7,1 November 2013,"It's the year 2022 and the world has completely gone to hell. Overpopulation has strangled the planet, nature as we know it has ceased to exist. There are 40 million people living in New York City alone and that is where our story is set. To call it a grim setting would be underselling it by quite some distance. Homeless people are crammed into every available space, living in the streets, in abandoned cars, in apartment building stairwells. Food is scarce. Fruits, vegetables? Forget it. And nobody's seen beef for years. Well, maybe a few people have. There are a lucky few who live in wealth and relative splendor. One of the seemingly lucky ones is William R. Simonson, a director of the Soylent Corporation. Soylent manufactures the wafers which are the food rations the general population survives on. These wafers come in various, different-colored varieties. By far the most popular is the tasty and nutritious Soylent Green. People riot in the streets to get some of this stuff. All seems well for the Soylent Corporation. They've got a product the world literally can't live without. But there is something about Soylent's operation which is tormenting Simonson. He knows a secret and his powerful friends are willing to kill to protect that secret. Simonson is assassinated. It's made to look like a robbery but police detective Thorn knows better. Thorn starts digging, trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. What he finds will shock him and shake him to his core.Charlton Heston plays Thorn and turns in a very solid, restrained performance. Maybe Heston goes a little over-the-top at the end but with what his character has discovered it's hard to blame him. While Heston is the film's star the real treat is Edward G. Robinson. He plays Sol Roth, an old scholar who assists Thorn in the investigation. There aren't many scholars around in this dystopian world. Sol is old enough to remember the way the world used to be, the beauty and majesty of it all. Robinson does a terrific job bringing out Sol's sadness at what the world has become. This would prove to be Robinson's final film which makes things all the more poignant. The best scene, by far, in the film comes near the end. It is a terrific scene for the character of Sol Roth and a truly magnificent send-off for the great Edward G. Robinson. It is the one truly great moment in a film which otherwise falls a little shy of greatness. It is a good film with an intriguing premise, a compelling mystery. The film provides a fascinating, and horrifying, look at mankind's possible future. There is the sense though that the film struggles at times for momentum. And the twist which so thoroughly shocks Thorn may not be as shocking for the audience, you can see it coming. But all in all it is a film well worth seeing. The story may have its flaws but it works well enough. Heston is good and Robinson is terrific, it's worth seeing the film for his performance alone. The teeming masses in this film would do anything to get their hands on some tasty Soylent Green. Movie audiences will find Soylent Green to be pretty tasty too.",Soylent Green

I wonder what the makers of this movie would WANT a civilization faced with extinction to do.  Starve?  But forget that.

This movie would have you believe that all the creative minds of science would find no inspiration to counter the possible consequences of overindustrialization. Got news for you guys; if things were THAT bad in the future, I doubt we'd be seeing that kind of population growth. This is the movie that first proposed ""global warming.""  Well, maybe give it a point for that.  Give it another point for Edward G.

Many reviewers said that it was badly dated and ""not futuristic enough"" - that's just why it works, and why it's aged better than most sci-fi films of the 80's and 90's; it's not built on special effects and glittery spaceships, instead the picture of the near-future that it illustrates is frighteningly realistic, and eerily enough, unlike most sci-fi movies of its time, it's even more relevant now than it was back then. Knowing the twist in advance (and you do know it, right?) may spoil the surprise of the last few minutes but it allows the viewer to enjoy the rest even more. A landmark in speculative and futuristic storytelling that's worth revisiting and rewatching now more than ever.",Soylent Green
69,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Interesting and thought provoking, but just a bit stale on arrival",7,21 February 2006,"In the year 2022 the Global Warming has risen to an almost unbearable level and the world population is an at all time high with 40 million people living in New York alone. Most of these people live basically on the street and sleep wherever they can and the world is at the brink of total anarchy. The rich, however, live in luxurious apartments, which come with things that we take for granted - soap, warm water, a selection of food - and other more more unusual things like your own personal woman to take care of your place and cook you food, a woman (considered a piece of furniture) with whom you may do as you please. There is also huge corporation that produces a miracle food stuff called Soylent Green and that is used to feed the masses of poor people and essentially prevents mass rioting. However, when one of the company heads is killed in a bizarre murder - his body guards happened to be away for the moment, the security system was off, and he showed no resistance to the assassin - NYC Detective Thorne investigates. He discovers unsettling secrets about the corporation and its product.From opening frame to closing shot this film, even on DVD, has a very dated look. Virtually nothing that a contemporary science fiction audience is used to and it is not a surprise as this film came out before Star Wars and the medium of sci-fi is used in the much more traditional sense of telling a story much more so then impressive visuals and sets. While I did feel that certain shots were missing, like a cityscape of New York 2022, and the whole film keeps the camera remarkable away from any sort of eye candy, save for a few women, but the mystery is nonetheless fairly engaging. To me this film played as more of a murder mystery for that matter. The science fiction element is there and it is essential, but it's merely a back drop.Another couple of things were the pacing, which seemed snailishly slow at times and the ending. While I dare not give away the end, it seems that Detective Thorne barely has a catharsis to all the crazy things that he just discovered. That gives his character a remarkably flat image. Though the story, while not as good as it could have been in its delivery, does bring up several interesting ideas and that makes it worth a watch. 7/10Generously Rated PG for some, but graphic, violence. Definitely a PG-13 by today's standards.",Soylent Green
70,tomimt,It is pretty funny.,8,21 September 2006,"Really, there are spoilers in here, so if you don't want to be spoiled don't read this.I think I shouldn't be laughing, I really do. I mean, I think 'Soylent Green' is meant to be a serious sci-fi film, but I found it hilarious. It's grim and it has black humour in it and every single stereotype you can come up with from the 70's detective film.So 'Soylent Green' tells a story of a cop named Thorn (Charlton Heston), who is investigating a death of a upper class citizen Simmons. On his way Thorn, and actually the whole world of this film, displays by his behaviour, that the world has changed into a exact opposite of utopia.After some questioning of Simmons's ""furniture"" Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young ) and bodyguard Fielding (Chuck Connors) and some petty thievery at the crime scene our courageous detective learns the horrible truth about food product called Soylent Green, which is the best of all the Soylent products, which provide the nutritious food cycle for every living person.I don't know. I pretty much guessed the whole big surprise and I almost fell from the chair when Heston uttered out the whole big thing in the exact same words that popped into my mind about the whole horrific ordeal.Either this film is a brilliant piece of black comedy or then it is just unintentionally funny. Either way I got the laughs out of it and really wouldn't mind of seeing it again.",Soylent Green
71,Dan1863Sickles,Classic Film Noir With A Sci-Fi Setting,10,2 September 2014,"This is the third jewel in Charlton Heston's legendary triple crown of three science fiction classics in a row. PLANET OF THE APES (1968) THE OMEGA MAN (1970) and SOYLENT GREEN (1973) One of these classics is not like the other two, however.PLANET OF THE APES and THE OMEGA MAN are both ""post-apocalyptic films."" In both stories, Heston plays the last hope of mankind. He plays a bigger than life hero with a strong military background who is forced to fight when outnumbered hundreds to one. In both cases he forges a ""victory"" that is moral rather than practical, leaving behind an unforgettable legacy. In both films he is not only fearless and brutal but articulate and philosophical, squaring off against a single religious leader who sees the defiant Heston as an almost Satanic menace to be wiped out.SOYLENT GREEN is science fiction, and set in the future, but the mood is very different. Here Heston plays an anti-hero, a crooked cop in a rundown futuristic city named Thorn. While Thorn is hard and bad and dangerous to cross, he is also shifty, venal and cynical in ways that even Neville and Taylor would have found disturbing, to say the least. Just watching him loot the apartment of a hapless murder victim while leering at the dead man's ""furniture"" (lovely Leigh Taylor-Young as ""Shirl,"" Heston's love interest and a full-time helpless victim, much like NOVA in Planet of the Apes) lets us know that this is not the same old science fiction epic.In SOYLENT GREEN, Heston plays a man who is not the ""last man"" on earth, nor is he a defiant defender of the human race. He's a dirty cop who gets off on his own total lack of standards, filching bourbon and beefsteak and consuming the stolen goods with almost obscene delight. His only real real human loyalty is to his elderly room mate Sol, (a superb Edward G. Robinson in his last screen performance) and he solves the big mystery almost by accident. Nevertheless, the film's final revelation is a terrifying twist with no equal in film history.Except of course, for the legendary last scene in PLANET OF THE APES.",Soylent Green
72,silverscreen888,Unforgettable Important Sci Fi; Overpopulation and Corruption,8,16 July 2005,"It is easy to see why this middling quality but well-thought-out novel by sci-fi veteran Harry Harrison appealed to Hollywood filmmakers. It has excellent parts for its policeman hero, Thorne, and for his aged human ""book"" or information-tracking expert, Sol Roth. Many others in this big-looking film have a rewarding scene or two each. It is visually very different, and I find it very-interesting, and obviously very thought-provoking in its projection of an Earth literally crawling with people and running out of everything; plus these qualities, it has exchanges between characters that lead to strong dialogue, fascinating discovery by the viewer along with the detective on the case, and a mystery whose climax in true Hitchcockian fashion is played against its own content. The film was competently directed by Richard Fleischer in dynamic fashion; and his work with actors in the film is unusually good throughout. The costumes by Pat Barto are varied and well-done; the script by Stanley R. Greenberg improves on some aspects of the novel, in my judgment as a writer. The cinematography by Richard H. Kline and the very unusual futuristic set decorations by Robert Benton shift back and forth from a police station to ultra-luxurious haunts of the government-connected super-wealthy who have everything to the apartment houses where people sleep on the stairs in huge numbers, to the city's streets where mass food distributions take place and rioters are picked up by giant metal scoops and hurled backward into yellow trucks.The storyline begins with the murder of a very rich man, a member of the Soylent Corporation that supplies much of the world's food supply. Detective Thorne is assigned by his Captain to the case, then told to drop it. In the meanwhile, he has discovered the deed was murder ;and he suspects the man's bodyguard, Tad, who was absent at that time. We learn much about the poverty of the time from Thorne's routine looting of the murder scene of a beefsteak, real paper, two books and soap--luxuries in his time which we take for granted...The ""furniture"", the girl who comes with the luxurious dwelling, knows little, except that the dead man, Simonson, had been crying. Halfway through his investigation, when he has made love to the girl, discovering the bodyguard is living beyond his means, he is told to drop the inquiry. The orders come from the Governor. Thorne refuses to sign the release since it could cost him his job if it is ever proved to be murder and he says it was not; all he has is the job. He is nearly killed on assignment to the scoop riot police during a distribution of soylent when soylent green, the favorite handout, is under-supplied, although he finishes off Simonson's assassin in the crowd. He traces Simonson to a priest to whom he had confessed something terrible,something which has unsettled the man's mind. The priest is killed by Tad soon afterward. Thorne then sends his ""book' with the two books he had looted to the book elders, who confirm from the books what Sil thinks he has discovered while Thorne had been gone. Having had a wonderful last meal, during which Sol tried to tell him how much better the Earth had once been, Sol decides to ""go home""--committing himself to drink a potion of death amidst shining orange color of his choice, lovely cinematic images and light classical music playing to a sunset--the images showing the Earth as it had been before overpopulation practices had destroyed is ecology. He has time to tell Thorne the oceans are dying, the plankton is dying--and that soylent green is people; that corpses are being reprocessed to make the food wafers that are handed out to sustain the teeming millions. Thorne traces the body of his friend by hopping onto a truck to a soylent plant, and sees bodies being dumped into processing vats for himself. He has to shoot his way out of the plant;then he is tracked after making phone calls to the girl and the Captain, by Tad and other killers trying to shoot him before he can tell his story. Shot and bleeding, he barely manages to kill Tad with a knife in the church shelter full of sleepers before the police find him and he tells them to tell the elders, to tell the world, he has the proof--that ""they'll be breeding us like cattle next, because soylent green is people!"" The acting in the film is good but occasionally uneven. Charlton Heston is above average as the detective, Edward G. Robinson, in his last film, made an award-level figure of Sol Roth; Brock Peters as the Captain, Whitner Bissell as the Governor and Joseph Cotten as Simonson are standouts. Chuck Connors is acceptable as Tad, Paula Kelly plays his pretty girl friend and Leigh Taylor-Young is low key at best as Simonson's furniture. Celia Lovsky plays the head of the elders beautifully, Stephen Young does well as the assassin, Leonard Stone is strong as the sadistic furniture department head and Lincoln Kilpatrick brings the distraught priest to life. The movie is sci fi at its best, by my standards, bringing to life a ""what if"" or potential situation based on pseudo-religious and statist practices that argue irresponsibility in allowing the bringing lives into the then showing by extension what will happen--and-must happen--if these practices and insanities are neither halted nor reversed. the film I find to be powerful, moody, a thoughtful mystery and a strong demonstration of how absolute power has corrupted a society. Its greatness lies in the fact that this was once the America of the individual dream and the individual responsibility--and now Thorne says, ""All cities are alike"". Sobering; always interesting and unusual, ""Soylent Green"" is an unforgettable film in many ways.",Soylent Green
73,virek213,Soylent Green Is...,7,25 July 2007,"The world of the 1973 sci-fi drama SOYLENT GREEN is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful. It is a world in which New York City's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022. Overpopulation, air pollution, year-long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule. The only hope comes from a food product called Soylent Green. But what is this particular food stuff really made of? That question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film, based on Harry Harrison's 1966 novel ""Make Room! Make Room!"" Charlton Heston stars as Thorne, an NYPD detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive (Joseph Cotten). As it turns out, Cotten was on the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing. Heston believes that this wasn't just a garden-variety murder, that Cotten was bumped off for a reason. He gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute ""book"" (Edward G. Robinson, in his 101st and final cinematic appearance), and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like. What Robinson finds out about Soylent Green shocks him beyond all imagination; but before he can tell Heston all of what he knows, he has himself euthanized. And when Heston does indeed find out the secret of Soylent Green...well, that part has become immortalized into cinematic history.Under the very professional guiding hand of director Richard Fleischer (THE BOSTON STRANGLER; FANTASTIC VOYAGE), SOYLENT GREEN is a fairly grim but thought-provoking look at a Dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources. Indeed, this was a project that Heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968, after he had struck gold in the sci-fi genre with PLANET OF THE APES--a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra-conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation (after all, SOYLENT GREEN is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism). Robinson, as always, is the consummate professional in his last role; the sequence where he is euthanized (as he looks at video of the world from a better era, set to the music of Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, and Grieg) is quite simply heartbreaking. The film also benefits from solid supporting help from Chuck Connors (as a very convincing heavy), Brock Peters (as Heston's superior), and Leigh Taylor-Young as the woman who tries to help Heston in his inquiries.It must seem easy these days to dismiss SOYLENT GREEN for being dated. But those who do it ought to think twice; for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today.",Soylent Green
74,Bogmeister,The Greenhouse Effect on Chuck,8,16 May 2006,"I've always liked this future-shock extrapolation of the way things may be a few decades from now, though, as of this writing, we're only a little over a decade away from the world depicted here (in year 2022). I'm not referring to the shocking revelation towards the end of the picture which, though intriguing and revolting, seems to have been included mostly for shock effect. I really liked all the details of future life depicted here, associated with the theme / problem of overpopulation (N.Y.City has 40 million people - it shouldn't be as bad when the real year comes around). There are many moments, such as the scarcity of food we currently take for granted, and the lack of decent living accommodations, seen mostly via the day-to-day existence of the main characters (Chuck Heston as a cop, Ed Robinson as his 'book,' Taylor-Young as 'furniture' - notice how certain people are referred to as things), that shows someone took time to work out the details through educated guesswork.I also liked the entire atmosphere of the film - the city is continually sweltering under a greenhouse effect out of control so everyone sweats. Though it's the future, there are no flying cars or similar advanced technology; indeed, the have-nots seem to just content themselves with hand-me-downs from past decades - witness the quaint little TV set in Heston's character's apartment. This actually makes sense; there's none of that unrealistic futurism of most other sf films, where it's as if, almost magically, one year all the super-advanced technology came about. So, this picture hasn't dated and probably won't for at least a dozen years; after that, who knows? It's odd how it wasn't well-received back in the seventies, but seems to have a growing appreciation now, much like ""Rollerball""(75). Maybe the best thing about it, however, is the father-son relationship between Heston's and Robinson's characters. Robinson especially, in his final role, contributed an Oscar-worthy performance. To get a full night's marathon of Chuck's sf films, view this after ""Planet of the Apes,"" its sequel, and ""The Omega Man"" - all made just before his work here.",Soylent Green
75,dr_foreman,"remember, before Star Wars, when sci-fi was smart?",10,1 July 2004,"Soylent Green IS...a really good movie, actually.I never would've thought it. I don't really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. He's one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green, too, but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I don't really mind.I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973), and it's lacking in action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt, and highly stratified society, and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving, funny final role. Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie.The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. Funny, isn't it, to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie...",Soylent Green
76,garethcrook,Okay it's not aged well but...,7,5 August 2020,"Soylent Green is from that most iconic genres of 70s cinema. The future focus disaster movie. I'm an absolute sucker for this stuff. Yeah I know it's a bit tropey, but these films really captured my imagination as a kid and that's stuck with me. We're in the year 2022 (don't laugh, the way 2020 is going, this might not be that far fetched!) Charlton Heston plays Detective Thorn (Heston was all over these films, The Omega Man, Planet of the Apes). Thorn lives in a world that now sustains itself on a diet of manufactured protein blocks. Soylent Green is the latest invitation in food nutrition. There's not much of it though. It's not a pretty world, post apocalyptic really, streets resemble dust filled morgues to a bygone era. Cars rusted and motionless, people scavenging. That's only one side of it of course. Class structure survives all it seems. Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young) lives with her 'employer' (Joseph Cotton, who I almost didn't recognise) in the future imagined in the 70s. This happens a lot in cinema doesn't it. She's surrounded by plastic, chrome and shag carpets. Maybe we've missed a trick, I'd quite like shag carpets I think. Anyway Shirl has it good, she can afford what's left of proper food, vegetables and the occasional slab of beef. Mr Simonson seems like a nice enough bloke and apparently treats her well. See even in the more affluent class, women aren't free, they're ""furniture"". It's gonna be short lived happiness though, for Simonson isn't going to get to enjoy that beef after being crow-barred by perhaps the nicest assailant. Here's our crime, enter Detective Thorn, all macho confidence. He's lax on professionalism, enjoying a brief taste of the highlife in the rich mans apartment. A rich man who's now to be driven outside the city for waste disposal. A detail that will become important later. Thorn's best mate is Sol (Edward G. Robinson), whom he shares his spoils with. Thorn is light fingered on the job, taking what he pleases as he slowly tries to get to the bottom of his murder case. Some of these spoils includes some books, Sol is a bit of a reader and these new books set the pair down the path of what the Soylent group are up to. This film plays a little uneasy now. It's a male dominated world, women treated with zero respect. Something Thorn seems to be pretty good at, not all that surprising considering Heston's attitude off screen. The more Thorn digs, the more suspicious he gets about Soylent and this corrupt society, ""Something stinks!"". Every time we go outside, the air seems a little bit greener, a cloud slowly casting over NYC. The third act kicks off with a riot as 'The Green' runs out and 'The Scoops' are sent in. Giant trucks that dig into the masses like earth and take them away to... well we have to wait for that. It marks the most chilling moments of the film, as Sol discovers the truth and opts for his own peaceful conclusion, but not before telling Thorn what we already know. I won't spoil anything here in case you've not already guessed and even if you have, it's still worth a watch. The finale is pure B-Movie slightly underwhelming brilliance.",Soylent Green
77,dragokin,a good old one,7,15 April 2014,"Soylent Green surprises with its depiction of near future, which is on par with a lot of science fiction movies made several decade after it. I guess that the memory of rations during the Second World War might as well resonated with the viewers.The future is bleak according to Soylent Green. The overpopulation and unemployment turned New York into a shanty town. On the other side is guarded housing for the upper classes where the lady of the house comes with the furniture and is referred to as such.The overall atmosphere is good and on par with movies with similar topic filmed decades later. There are wonderful details ranging from riot police to clear the mess at a food market to Charlton Heston's delight with running water in one of the aforementioned apartments.The only thing slightly ruining the viewers' pleasure is the simplicity if not naivety with which the main character solves the mysteries behind the Soylent Corporation.",Soylent Green
78,verbusen,Film Viewers Should Analyze More The Politics More........,7,6 October 2005,"I give this end of civilization as we know it film a 7/10. One of my favorites for a couple of decades, now it's a curiosity with tons of flaws. Let's see it's the future, it's America, lets look at some points of the film. People are living in overcrowded urban centers. Crime and drug use are rampant, prostitution is a given, euthanasia is encouraged, all signs of a society run by right wingers right? Nooooo, a sign of stupid lefties who elect elites that promise them their Soylent Green! And whats with the Soylent Green and why was that so much better than the Soylent Orange to cause people to have a fatal riot because all that was left was Soylent Orange? A lefties delight I guess, I know I always hated corporations after watching this movie along with Rollerball (thats where the bad corporations became a big world government), and who can forget a great finale of a liberal delight triple feature ""Silent Running"", boy now that is some fun times to have with your favorite hippie chick man! And whats with that time frame of 1971-75 man was Hollywood cranking out some leftist propaganda there just with those three! Anyway, if you really want to look at Soylent Green objectionably you could easily make a case that a leftist dominated culture would lead to a time when no one really worked, they slept in stairways or in the street all day till it was time they got in line for whatever food the government gave out to them, and that the people who were'nt lazy or misguided but thought for themselves would become the elite ruling class who lived away from the inner city, gee a lot like now! The featurette of the making of this flick is just too unwatchable unless your doing some bong hits maybe. Peace man, down with Haliburton!

79,nickenchuggets,How much damage can the earth take?,8,1 June 2021,"Soylent Green is a movie that many people have mixed feelings about. It has a storyline that a lot of people hate, but it's one that I mostly love, and it is made better by the fact that the movie takes place in the 2020s. It also manages to somewhat accurately predict the current state of our world. The story is about a planet earth being threatened by pollution, food shortages, lack of water, and a growing human population that is unable to sustain itself. New York Police detective Frank Thorn played by Charlton Heston is living in a run down house with his elderly friend Sol Roth (Edward G Robinson), someone
who is old enough to remember the faraway times when earth had real food and not artificial garbage. Later, Frank is called upon to investigate the murder of someone who was a member of a company called Soylent who specialize in making beverages made from things that do not tax the earth's resources too heavily. Their newest drink is called Soylent Green, which they boast as being made from plankton. Throughout the movie, we see violent protests erupt in the streets because there are simply too many people everywhere and not enough food for all of them. Towards the end, Sol becomes suicidal for living in a world
that has no natural joy anymore and allows the government to euthanize him. They put him in a special room where he lies down and watches a montage of animals, forests, and sunlight on a screen. After Sol dies,
Frank manages to sneak into an industrial plant where the movie finally reveals its horrific plot twist: Soylent Green is made of human corpses. After being wounded by gunfire, he wants other people to know the truth about the product. This is a movie that some people might think of as boring or slow moving, and I kind of agree. There are many parts where nothing really happens and it's just two characters talking in an apartment, but in the last 20 minutes or so, it picks up. Heston as Frank Thorn is convincing in his portrayal of a detective, but Robinson as Sol is this movie's real tragic figure. His death in the movie
is made even more sad by the fact that this was the last movie he was ever in. He actually died of bladder cancer before the film was released. Overall, it's a eerie prediction of what earth might look like if we keep exploiting the environment.",Soylent Green
80,dfle3,An imagined future for humanity...with a twist,6,4 July 2008,"I first heard about this movie when Roseanne Barr mentioned it (from the great U.S. sitcom ""Roseanne""-she mentioned it on her own talkshow, I think). Even though I don't remember it too well, it did leave an impression on me and that is what I want to convey in this review.A brief and (very) vague synopsis first: ostensibly, this is a movie about a murder investigation, set in the future I think. If I'm wrong about that, it doesn't matter. What IS important is that this is a kind of M. Night Shyamalan movie (of ""The sixth sense"" fame, amongst other movies). In other words, it is ALL about the twist. It is the twist in this movie that will stay with you forever and I won't spoil that surprise for you.It also seems to me that this movie is punching way above its weight, cultural significance wise. If I hadn't of seen this movie, the references to it on Shaun Micallef's brilliant satirical programme ""Newstopia"" would have been totally lost on me. Once you know the twist in this movie, you can't help but notice references to it, especially in comedy, where it is often referenced.Lastly, I just want to say that as someone in the food industry, this movie has its pleasures. I work for Kraft in Australia (no, really. Would I lie to you?). Here at Kraft, we call Vegemite ""Soylent Brown"". Or, if quality control and hygiene is an issue ""Soilent Brown"".I'm giving this movie 6/10, mostly for the fact that it has an intriguing twist to the tale and is memorable. Hmmm, is this movie prophetic? Interesting vision of the future, in any case.",Soylent Green
81,hellholehorror,Twist,4,3 October 2021,This was kinda funny. Only because of the outdated style. This is not a fast paced film. There are some exciting action sequences like in the factory at the end but nothing hugely amazing. The twist at the end is so predictable that it is laughable. They make so much big deal about the twist you would never guess and I guessed it without looking at the film itself - you just need to know that there is a twist and food to realise what is going on.

82,emperor_bender,"""People were always rotten. But the world was beautiful.""",9,11 March 2009,"This movie is highly underrated.Soylent Green is a one-of-a-kind movie. The future depicted in the movie is nothing at all like today, but that's what makes it so much fun.Many complain that it looks too much like the 70's, but that's how it is supposed to look: like society hasn't advanced since the 70's.I thought the setting was very moving and unnerving, I will even go so far as to say some scenes in this movie really disturbed me. Along with the music and gritty characters, I was really moved.I thought Charlton Heston did a good job of playing Thorn, a NYC detective assigned to a high-profile murder case. Joseph Cotten did well portraying William Simonson, one of the top executives of the Soylent corporation. Leigh Taylor Young did well as Shirl, Simonson's ""furniture"". Brock Peters did a good job of playing Hatcher, Thorn's snooty boss. The best performance by far was Edward Robinson as Sol Roth, Thorn's elderly roommate/friend/co-worker who was around back when the world was good and hates what it has become.The movie is very very gritty. Mean/heartless characters, rock-bottom settings, and all sorts of fun post-apocalyptic type of things.This is a very smart movie. Sci-fi fans should have this on their list.9/10",Soylent Green
83,LCShackley,Al Gore should show this movie instead...,8,15 October 2007,"I went to see SOYLENT GREEN at least 3 times in 1973 when I was 17 and a senior in high school. Now I've just watched it uncut with my youngest son, who's now 17 and a senior in high school. The film has held up very well, although the print shown on TCM was fuzzy. Of course, everyone now knows the classic closing line, so there's no real mystery left, but it's still interesting to watch Charlton Heston work his way through the clues until he arrives at the horrible conclusion.There are some wonderful scenes in SOYLENT GREEN, such as the riot with the people scoops, the shootout in the church, the visit to the grocery, and the very touching final scenes with Edward G. Robinson. For me, one of the riveting highlights of the original film was the opening montage, which is often cut when shown on late-night TV. Thank you, TCM, for leaving it in. This combination of powerful visuals and a truly amazing bit of film music by Fred Myrow puts the viewer in the perfect frame of mind for the first shot of NYC in 2022.Of course, there are some dated scenes (the video game!) but all in all SOYLENT GREEN creates a world that it's not hard to believe could happen (without Al Gore's intervention, of course). Bit parts for ubiquitous TV actors Whit Bissell and Dick Van Patten are fun to spot, and Leigh Taylor-Young is vulnerable and pitiable as the forgotten furniture. It's hard to imagine anyone but Charlton Heston holding this picture together as the tough cop with a soft spot for an old friend.

Also worthy of note were Charlton Heston (of course) playing the hero role with his usual aplomb and Leigh Taylor-Young who I thought did a very good job as the female lead. The film has quite a slow pace and I like the way it doesn't stop every few minutes to explain everything. The filmmakers did give the audience some credit for intelligence (for a change) and I appreciated that! Beautifully shot with a nice score but my favourite scene will always be Sol's death; it's one that will stay with you for a long time!

86,Scars_Remain,Amazing and Thought Provoking,10,7 August 2008,"I just finished 1973's Soylent Green and am blown away by how awesome it was and how I have heard so little about it. I feel that it is a unfairly overlooked classic that it still very terrifying and real to this very day. I found similarities in this movie to A Boy and His Dog, A Clockwork Orange, and Mad Max. And while I love and cherish all of those films, I really think this is the best of them. I can't tell you enough how great it really is.Charlton Heston, Leigh Taylor-Young Edward G. Robinson are all amazing in their roles and especially Robinson who was almost completely deaf and dying of cancer. The story is brilliant. It's one of those stories that inspired me to go out and write something and see what I come up with. I loved everything else too, the action, the effects, the dialog. It's all wonderful.I think this film is a necessity for film lovers everywhere. It will make you think and even creep you out at the same time. See it!",Soylent Green
87,mmallon4,Spoiler Green,10,24 June 2016,"Of the major movie stars of the 20th century, one who has certainly secured his immortality with a succession of highly iconic films is Charlton Heston. Soylent Green was the last of these and the final film of what I like to call the Charlton Heston dystopian sci-fi trilogy along with Planet of the Apes and The Omega Man. Now that we have arrived in the future itself by meeting the timeline of Back to the Future Part II and with the dates of Blade Runner and Soylent Green being not far away let us bask in the dystopian wasteland Earth has become. Ok, maybe not quite.Soylent Green was Edward G Robinson's final film from a career spanning over 40 years, and the man is still as complete a pro as he ever was. Charlton Heston may be the main star but Robinson steals the show holding some of the best scenes in the film. Take the scene in which Robinson becomes emotional and cries at seeing beef for the first time in years; it takes a great actor to avoid such a scene becoming comical. Likewise, the interaction between Robinson and Heston is simply a pleasure to watch and his last moments on screen where some of his most affecting of his long career. This is also a role in which Robinson's real-life personality comes through as a man of high culture and a lover of art. The apartment he shares with Heston is full of books, paint brushes, classical music is often played not to mention his character is Jewish. I do love this little sanctuary they have in a world in which crowds people are sleeping on the stairs outside their apartment. I also get the impression there is something more between them than just friendship? During the movie, they claim their love for each other in an un-ironic nature and speak intimately with each other about their personal feelings. Or is there simply just share a platonic love for each other as friends? Who knows?There are only two uses of matte painting cityscapes throughout Soylent Green. The film shows how you can really create a believable world through the use of intimate on set shooting. I'm sure a remake of Soylent Green would feature a vast CGI city which would have none of the characters which is presented here. This is not a movie which is made for kids. Towards the end of the film, there are surprisingly horrifying scenes and of course there is the ending; an ending which has been spoiled by pop culture. The ending would have affected me more if I had not known it but are spoilers just a part of life?",Soylent Green
88,Tak005,A warning about the environment,7,10 January 2015,"This movie first debuted in 1973. It is set in New York about the year 2020. The environment is being destroyed. The world is overpopulated, starving and crime is rampant. Social chaos is rife. For example prostitution is considered a normal way of life. Women are sold as prostitutes along with apartments. Due to the era of the making of the film they are euphanistically referred to as ""furniture"". Through all of this threads a murder inquiry by the main characters as a reason for the story to progress. When I saw this film upon its release it was quit clear that it was intended mainly as a vessel for making a statement about the environment. This is still the case but perhaps the timing and importance is not so easily recognised. In our times as we are now about the same years as the films setting. The supposed depth of the worlds despair, and the 1970's fashions, depicted in the movie may seem a bit comical. But at least in these days we all understand the importance of protecting the environment. In 1973 powerful messages were required to jolt peoples minds into action.",Soylent Green
89,freakfire-1,Corny Corny Corny,4,30 May 2008,"Ah Mr. Heston, where would I be without your exploits in movies that are well beyond reality? Probably less entertained. In any case, this movie is one the stranger ones he did. And certainly, it deserves that title beyond all doubt in mind.Heston plays a man in a time 50 years beyond when this movie was made, which is only about years from now. Food is gone, so is oil, manufacturing, and all sense of humanity. Trucks come through and 'harvest' when people protest. Somehow, 40 million live in NYC and all is asinine.The ending is expected, but the action right before is not. It kind of ruins everything when I figure out the ending in the first 5 minutes.Its a cult movie, but not a great one. ""C-""",Soylent Green
90,disinterested_spectator,Ruined by the Ending,5,4 January 2016,"""Soylent Green"" is more interesting as a futuristic milieu than as a story. From a 1973 perspective, the movie imagines the world in 2022, where the temperature is stifling owing to the greenhouse effect, and where overpopulation has reached critical proportions. Only the very rich and well-connected eat what for us is ordinary food, while the vast majority must eat crackers of different colors indicating their quality, with green being the most desirable because it is the most nutritious. Even water is rationed.There are film noir elements in this movie. Detective Thorn (Charlton Heston) is basically a good cop, but when investigating the crime scenes of rich victims, he does a little looting, mostly taking items of food, like beefsteak, vegetables, and liquor, and he also helps himself to whatever prostitute, referred to as ""furniture,"" happens to be attached to the luxury apartment.Whereas today, a science fiction movie must display the latest in special effects, such as CGI and 3D, this movie effectively creates its world without recourse to anything but ordinary photography. We see Thorn having to struggle to walk up the steps to his apartment, because there are so many people sleeping on the stairs. Later, when a riot starts because there is a shortage of Soylent Green wafers, we see dump trucks called ""scoops"" being used to remove people from the streets.As for the plot, Thorn investigates the murder of Simonson (Joseph Cotton), which he suspects is an assassination. Thorn's assistant, referred to as a ""book,"" on account of his ability to do research on old written material, is Sol (Edward G. Robinson). Sol learns a terrible secret and decides to end it all by going to a euthanasia center, where he gets to look at scenes of nature as it once was and listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes before dying from some concoction he imbibed. Before dying, he tells Thorn that the plankton used to make Soylent Green is disappearing from the oceans. As a substitute for the loss of plankton, people that die are secretly processed and turned into the Soylent Green wafers.The problem with the story described thus far is that it never gets past the ick factor. Rich men are obnoxious, and we resent the way they are so privileged and arrogant. The image of old people walking into euthanasia centers to end their lives is creepy. And the use of human flesh to make edible wafers is disturbing. Setting aside the fact that cannibalism can lead to the transmission of abnormal prions as in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the main objection to using human flesh for consumption is that the idea of it is repulsive. But in a world that is overpopulated and in which there is a food shortage, such a solution may actually be rational. After all, we are not talking about the kind of cannibalism where we have a bunch of savages standing around a pot with a missionary in it. The people being turned into food either died naturally or, in the case of the euthanasia centers, voluntarily. So, the worst you can say about such a world is that it makes us feel a little queasy.Nevertheless, the movie should have simply ended with this revelation about Soylent Green. Instead, in an apparent effort to make the whole business more insidious, Thorn tells his supervisor, ""They're making our food out of people. Next thing, they'll be breeding us like cattle."" Unfortunately, this line, which is supposed to make us even more horrified by what is going on, only makes us groan at its absurdity. In a world where there are too many people, it makes no sense to breed more. You just eat the ones you have. Furthermore, according to my rough, back-of-the-envelope calculations, you would have to feed people at least five times as much protein to raise them as you would get out of them once you brought them to slaughter. Because this idea of breeding people is illogical, it turns what would have been a believable, pessimistic vision of the future into something so silly we can only snort with contempt.",Soylent Green

Of the several Sci-fi films mentioned in these comments, I kinda remember ""Planet of the Apes"" - and its millions of sequels - admit I didn't enjoy THAT film too much, either.Let's see: it's 13 years till ""Soylent"" - hmmmmmmmm. I often wonder, if you're dead and your soul has ""gone home"", how does it matter what happens to the body? If there are ""centers"" for consensual euthanasia, someone send me the address; if that super-powerful bomb recently tested by Russia, where everything is just vaporized, let me know where they are going to test the next one. WHO would want to live in conditions such as ""Green"" projects, although kinda seems like it just MAY be 2022? Ever notice how expensive items in markets are from one visit to the next???Although I recognized the title of this movie, I had no idea what it's about. I assume I would have watched it out of curiosity; I don't think I'd have been more impressed watching it when it was released, as I did from TCM's presentation. Only Edward G Robinson (""Sol"") impressed me with any kind of acting skill - Chuck Conners and all those others who played their roles with a total lack of genius, were as you saw them in other movies. I completely missed any scene where the CEO gave a confession to ""Father Paul"" (Lincoln Kilpatrick) and could not figure-out why he was assassinated. Dumb me ! I DID perceive homosexuality in all those overly protective ""furnitures"". Director Fleisher certainly got all the right things together for his job, but to what avail? Stanley Green's script, who can judge unless you're read the novel? I'd last about two pages into that.....Some of the cinematography was gorgeous - I'm not all that skeptical our planet could evolve to this point when you get two hurricanes attacking one country at the same time (Mexico 2007), and you can see more storms developing in every TV weather-report.If this is your cup of tea, enjoy - I'll stick to the classics. I'm happy to have lived to witness all those beautiful things projected at ""the center"". I'm still confused at what happened to the folk scooped-up into the trucks: was there something in there to kill them?

93,frankwiener,Polly Want a Cracker?,8,3 November 2017,"While we are constantly bombarded with the terms ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" today from numerous media sources, rarely do we hear about one of the primary causes of these conditions, which is the explosion of the world's population, primarily on much of the Asian and African continents. Apparently, it is politically incorrect nowadays to mention uncontrollable, unsustainable population growth in these places because rarely is it ever mentioned as a direct contributor to environmental disaster. Although the setting of this apocalyptic movie is New York, and we know very well that the population of the Big Apple won't reach anywhere near 40 million in five years (2022), the population of many cities in Asia and Africa have in fact increased by five-fold since this film was produced in 1973. They include Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Beijing, and Shanghai in China, Bangalore and Delhi in India, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Karachi in Pakistan, Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lagos in Nigeria. I'm sure that there are many other cities that can be added to this list. While the population crisis presented by this film clearly did not occur in New York, it did in fact take place in many other cities over the past 44 years, and that is very critical to the movie's fundamental message, which maintains its vital significance today.The opening montage of still photos, first in black and white before shifting to color, that depicts the world's environmental degradation during the past century is very powerful and very sobering. Any fan of Edward G. Robinson, and I am one of those, should be deeply moved by his spectacular, symphonic farewell to us in the euthanasia facility only days before he passed away in real life.Considering all of the recent revelations about the debasement and humiliation of women throughout Hollywood history, I found the reference to young, abused women here as inanimate ""furniture"" to be true to life in a distinctly Hollywood kind of way. After all, who knows more about the ""furniture"" of Hollywood studios than Hollywood itself? There's an interior decorator on every corner.Hopefully, our world will never see this work of fiction become reality. Bon appetite!",Soylent Green

Is the planet overrun with people now? I'd say yes to that. I don't think we are eating Soylent Green yet but this movie seems way more realistic today than it was in 1973. We who live in the rich countries don't even see the billions who live in poverty today. Americans of all walks are still 10 times richer than those who live elsewhere. The sad thing we don't know is how countries like China are feeding their billion peasants. We only see the 400 million wealthy Chinese elites who live off the backs of their peasants. We do know they use them for spare parts today. We also know that North Korean people use their own feces to fertilize their crops and that causes diseases.

98,Ozzy2000,A good film about the pending overpopulation problem,9,5 July 2008,"Its time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one. His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works.This film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth , in 2022, that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called ""Soylent Green"" which is manufactured with Human flesh. This bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes India's population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it.Charlton Heston's character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism.Unfortunately for the producers of this film the Green message they deliver is not the Greens Party of today's ethos thank god. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in New Zealand , Fiji and Borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization.Another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made.The film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great Edward G. Robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons.This is a dud of a film and I wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film I have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the USA in which an ecological disaster has occurred.The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.",Soylent Green

100,ScottAmundsen,Classic Science Fiction Drama that is Starting to Sound Prophetic.,10,28 July 2012,"I was ten years old when this film was released. I am now approaching fifty so I don't know how reliable my memory is, but I recall a rash of dreadful reviews and if my memory is accurate the film was a major flop, at least in New York where I lived. With that in mind and science fiction films not really my cup of tea (with some notable exceptions), it was not until I was an adult, on my own, that the film came on one of my cable channels, so, not having anything better to do, I decided to check it out.Wow. Just WOW.Futuristic dystopias are difficult things to pull off; they require a construction of an entire new world (excuse the pun). There are really only a handful of titles in this particular subgenre that have met with success, and they usually work better as novels than as films.I have not yet read Harry Harrison's novel MAKE ROOM! MAKE ROOM! upon which this film is based, but I just ordered it; the comparison should be interesting.But back to SOYLENT GREEN. When I finally saw this film I was blown away by it. And to this day I cannot understand all the negative reviews it got in its initial release or the lack of box-office. Perhaps I am remembering things incorrectly. Because this is a classic example of its genre that draws you into its dark and sinister view of the future and which I found quite terrifying.The year: 2022. The place: New York, a city that has become so overcrowded that in every apartment building there are people sleeping two deep in the stairwells; the air is brown with pollution and the heat is oppressive. The world's natural resources have been all but exhausted and the bulk of the population lives on a product called ""Soylent,"" which look rather like sugar wafers and come in a variety of colors (flavors?); the name is a combination of soybeans and lentils.Not everyone lives this way though: a small handful of super-rich corporate executives live in luxury, with well-appointed apartments that have air conditioning and running water, and their diet consists of the fresh food that the bulk of the population can only dream of, if they even remember it.One night, Soylent board member (great cameo by the wonderful Joseph Cotten) is brutally murdered, something that the scene between him and his killer reveals that he not only saw coming but accepted as some form of atonement.Enter Detective Thorn (Charlton Heston), a sharp police detective and one of the few people in New York fortunate enough to have a job. His assignment: to investigate the murder. He is helped in his efforts by Sol Roth (the great Edward G Robinson in his final film), an historian with a prodigious memory that has earned him the title of ""book."" I am not going to reveal much more; like most science fiction, this story is plot-heavy and too many spoilers would kill the flavor. Suffice it to say that Thorn soon picks up on the fact that someone does not want him to solve this case; even his chief (Brock Peters in a performance that makes you wish he had more screen time) starts to try to persuade him to drop it.Charlton Heston has never been one of my favorite actors: while he often made a great hero, he was usually rather stiff and his acting superficial. But not always; there were exceptions, and SOYLENT GREEN is one of them. In fact there is one scene where Heston actually cries real tears, something I don't think I ever saw the man do in any other film. And it is also refreshing to see him shed his hero persona; he is still the ostensible ""hero"" of the piece, but there is nothing noble about the man: when he investigates the murdered man's apartment, he takes all the food in the fridge as well as all the liquor, showers, and even avails himself of the sexual favors of the young woman (Leigh Taylor-Young) who ""goes with the apartment"" for just that purpose and who is referred to several times as ""furniture.""But if Heston is the action man, the brains, heart, and soul of this story belong to Sol. Edward G Robinson, a great actor who unfortunately got typecast as a gangster in Hollywood, is amazing here; suffering from cancer, he no doubt knew that this would be his last film and he took that knowledge and used it to inform his characterization of Sol. It is a marvelous performance that not only ended Robinson's career on a high note but which had a definite positive effect on Heston; he is light years better in this than he is in a lot of his movies.The real kicker about SOYLENT GREEN is not so much the ending anymore, though it was considered a shocker in 1973. Watching the film now, nearly forty years later, it is surprising how predictive it was, and there is an unexpected global warming message that I am sure was merely fancy on the part of the authors but which has proved to be alarmingly prescient.Why it was not a big success in 1973 I don't know, because this is a great movie intended not only to entertain but to send a warning. And the warning comes through the drama loud and clear and we ignore it at our own peril.",Soylent Green

Too many people, and nothing works.  The only people who can live in comfort are the rich.  It's set in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta.I got to appreciate Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil.  He was (maybe is) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people.  Here, he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt (taking rare food treats from the rich), and being totally corrupt (actively condoning evil).  The movie all seems to take place at night, and sweat is dripping off everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments.  Even though I hadn't seen it before, I knew the famous ending (which will not here be revealed), but the ending is certainly foreshadowed.Great scenes with Edward G.

103,jakob13,Solemn ritual of man made distruciton,8,3 May 2017,"In seeing 'Soylent Green' in 2017, we are struck how immediate and contemporary it is. We are living in a time that takes history and facts in a less detached way manner than we did in the past: objectivity has, it seems, no virtue,no relevance. Harry Harrison's dystopian novel 'Make Room! Make Room! became the film 'Soylent Green', under the skillful hand of director Richard Fleischer. The film's appropriate to our times; it speaks to our condition; its themes are associated with today's moral and social and political issues. 'Soylent Green' reveals in a futuristic New York, the consequences of global warming, that America's coupon clippers deny. The film released in 1974 talks of the 'greenhouse effect', a term that has slipped out of public consciousness, yet vividly represented by Fleischer as a world of excessive temperatures, over populated, with insufficient housing, a world of the poor and hungry who live cheek to jowl even in stairwells; churches have become warehouses for the homeless and the huddled masses. The rising temperatures have rendered the earth sterile so that food production cannot sustain life, and a corporation of the rich find ways to feed the 99 percent with something called 'soylent yellow, brown and now green'. 'Soylent Green' is a morality tale; it has definite lessons for our ruling corporate classes if they would only drop the scales from this eyes, and cleans the encrusted wax in their ears. We are in a world where the 1 percent, live in luxury and the 99 percent in despair. The film has, obviously, a bearing on the way our elite make decisions only for their bottom line. Slaves exist; they are called furniture; no longer human, they serve for sexual pleasure, and can be discarded at will like an old lamp or chair that no longer serves its purposes. The film's conceit has an echo from the 18 century: Dean Jonathan Swift says it all in 'A Modest Proposal'. 'Soylent Green's' universe is one that believes in waste not want not and all that hoary dictum entails. The film follows the tried and true hard-boiled detective genre with its twists and turns; its corrupt practices, its tail of dead,its false leads and chases, the heavy hand of the powerful to quash the hero Thron played with clenched jaws (Charlton Heston's trade mark) from getting at the truth. He is ably supported by Sol Roth (played by Edward G. Robinson, in his last film role) with a turn that enables Thorn or Heston to find his way. Chuck Connors is a cool killer at the beckon and call of the corporate powers that rule this claustrophobic world. Black actors play secondary but important roles, which says something for the casting of those days when Nixon's Southern Strategy was in full swing.'Soylent Green' is a film that deserves to be review and shown in schools, on television regularly. It has cautionary lessons for us that we should learn, yet the Trump White House and his billionaire cronies are pushing our planet to the hour when life on Earth will look like the ambiance of suffering and torment of the mass of people while the sybaritic holders of power make merry and money and enjoy the fruits of power as the world goes to hell in a hand basket.",Soylent Green
104,robert3750,"Good performances, but NOT prophetic",5,17 July 2017,"The film is worth it to see the performances by Heston and Robinson (especially Robinson, since it was his last film). However, it's hardly anything resembling an accurate prediction of the future. The events in it are obviously a reflection of the attitudes expressed by people such as Paul Ehrlich, who has made a career out of incessantly predicting dire consequences from having ""too many people and/or too much technology and/or too much capitalism"". His predictions have all turned out to be wrong, including his famous bet with Julian Simon about the future price of metals. There are actually MORE trees in the US than there were 100 years ago. The fruits of capitalism, such as smart phones, have hardly made us poorer, nor has the much ballyhooed rise in global temperatures had the predicted apocalyptic consequences. There is no mass starvation due to an environmental catastrophe, and the rather silly depiction of a New York City with a population of 40 million in 2022 is obviously wrong (the city has grown by a few hundred thousand since the movie was made).

105,Qanqor,Soylent Green is... preposterously implausible,5,3 July 2008,"Not a bad film, not a great one. Kind of memorable, kind of thought-provoking, but, once you are provoked to thought and actually think about it... it doesn't make any sense.The problem is, that, in coming up with a vision of this future dystopia, little of any actual thought was put into considering the actual ramifications of the plight the world was supposed to be suffering. They just threw in anything that seemed 'bad'-- crowding, pollution, shortages, corruption... without considering how the factors would intertwine with each other. So, we end up with some pretty nonsensical contradictions:1) We see that cars are no longer used for transportation, there's very little in terms of any kind of production of anything, you can't get parts for things... in short, Industrialization has pretty much ground to a halt. So where's all that *pollution* coming from?2) The situation is *extremely* volatile (understandably), with riots aplenty, and the only thing that seems capable of maintaining order is a heavy-handed police force. And certainly, the Powers-That-Be *want* to maintain order (and thus, power). So logically, they should be hiring LOTS of police force. Especially since, with *vast armies* of broke, jobless people living in cars and stairways, the price of labor has to be *dirt cheap*. They should have no problem at all hiring all the cops they want. Especially given that they're already not too fastidious about the character of the cops, given the rampant corruption. So why is the police force repeatedly shown to be thin on manpower?3) If the earth is so polluted and messed up that you can't even raise food anymore, if farms aren't functioning, and people are reduced to eating synthesized dead people or sea algae, then why on earth is everybody shoehorned into cities like that? Why don't they at least spread out into the unused unproductive former farmland?4) Given how dire things are, why aren't more people simply starving to death? Or dying of disease? If things are really as bad as they are claimed to be, it seems impossible that society could be as stable as it is portrayed.5) How is it that the same species that had all the brains to come up with all the scientific/technological/industrial magic that *led* to this situation, was unable to think of *any* kinds of solutions to any of the problems? I mean, really, ""eating people"" was the best that human-kind could come up with?6) What is that nonsense idea at the end about how soon they'll be raising people for food? What are they going to feed those people? That's a highly inefficient way to make food, you'd do better just directly feeding the people with what you would have fed your people-crop.The truth is, the whole threat of industrial overpopulation flies in the face of the observed fact that rising industrialization produces rising standard of living which produces *lowered* birth rates. So this was NEVER going to be a profound look at a possible future. But even so, they could've taken more trouble to introduce a little more logic and economics into the story.I'm looking forward to watching this movie again in the year 2022 and having a good laugh at its myopic vision of a future that will never come close to being.",Soylent Green
106,thespeos,Great Film? No. Watch it for Edward G. Robinson's Talents : ),8,9 November 2021,"I always watch films with Heston and / or Robinson, so I'm biased towards their work.I've watched this many times and last night I found so many new (moral) gems in it.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
As a whole, the story is not all that interesting. No, it's fairly flat even for a ""doomsday"" film.But I will distinguish the plot from the details of the story and especially the character relationships.It's the relationships, the characters looking back and forth across time that make this film a dour
statement about humans (yes, that includes you and me). Frankly, the whole apocalyptic tenor of
this film sometimes gets lost in cheesy props and awkward acting, but if you can get past that ...
there's some powerful messages and a thread of deep love here.ACTING:
It seems that reviewers either love or hate Heston, but he's a strong presence and is apt to evoke
those swings. Robinson though, is not so polarizing a figure, but his acting is in no wise less capable.For me, he clearly sets the tone, threads the story, and expresses such a brilliant and wide palette of feeling. He makes this film.Bonus: Joseph Cotton has a (minor) part in this film, and it was nice to see a great actor working it in his latter years.TEMPO:
About right, though it gets a little caught up in trying to convey a dystopian world.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
OK, but a bit on the cheesy side.DIRECTING / WRITING:
There's a reason this feels like a ""Made-for-TV"" film - Greenberg (Screenplay) was strictly a TV writer. Yuck ...
That's why it feels cheesy, cheap, stiff ... when you see ""Dick Van Patten"" in a feature film then you know it's
going to be cheesy (Mr. Cheese himself).Is it a very good film? No. Should you watch this once? Yes.Rating: 7.5.",Soylent Green
107,andre-71,"good film, but not brilliant",7,15 June 2001,"Best thing about this film is its story. Having in mind that it was made in 1973, it is amazing how today's problems are addressed, like the greenhouse effect and overpopulation. I could think of a few persons who should watch this film carefully. Unfortunately, the director chose quite unconvincing sets for what he tried to show. Neither overpopulation nor pollution seemed real. I also realized a few inconsistencies in the behaviour of the characters (e.g. Why did the crowd not grab the Soylent food on the market when the uproar about the food shortage commenced?). But just as ""Omega Man, The (1971)"" this movie has a style which is unmatched by today's Hollywood productions and truly worth watching.",Soylent Green

109,writenamehere,Ben Hur does LSD,2,14 April 2021,"You might have occasionally heard the reference to Soylent Green in conversation, but not understood what it was supposed to mean, or even that it was a film title. Well, you're in for an unpleasent surprise! As a sci-fi film from the past about ""our future"" is has some disturbing parallels to how we live now. I sure do hope we don't end that way though. Some of the crowd control scenes are pretty funny - poor stage effects and unnecessarily wild screaming. Other than that, it's an absolute horror show as far as what was socially acceptable way back in those ""simpler times"" of movie making. By today's standards it has lots of macho swagger and projection of inconvenient male emotions onto women. I guess we have to put that aside, along with the other current political sins, and see what's left. I saw this via Nutflax, who appear to be trying to offset their usually solid diet of woke programming. This kind of swinging violently from one extreme to the other isn't an improvement.

110,flickershows,SNL Ruined 'Soylent Green'!,6,19 February 2004,"How do I explain this without giving away the ending of the movie (which is EXACTLY what Saturday Night Live did many years ago)? Let's just say that the late Phil Hartman's funny impression of Chuck Heston shouting out his big revelation in 'Soylent Green' made watching the movie anti-climactic. I knew what the final few lines of dialogue would be before I even picked up the DVD from the shelf of the local video store. Damn you, SNL! Damn you all to hell! ... Oh, wait, that's a quote from ANOTHER film in Heston's sci-fi period.Actually, the movie is quiet and foreboding, building a sense of doom. Heston does what he's supposed to do, which is keep his over-acting to a dull roar. His best buddy (played by Edward G. Robinson, in his last performance) gets a touching farewell sequence that leads Heston's detective character called Robert Thorn to the shocking climax. I wonder if Jonathan Swift would be proud of the Soylent company's solution to the crisis of overpopulation...There are some memorable scenes to be found here, but this is not very exciting stuff as sci-fi/thrillers go. Of course, if you don't know what I'm talking about in that first paragraph, perhaps your heart will be pounding out of your ears at the end of the flick. A cameo by Orson Welles' alumnus, Joseph Cotton, is actually what starts the story in motion. He's on-screen for about 2 minutes, but what happens to him sets it all up. So if you enjoy watching Moses go into hyperdrive, teeth-clenching mode once again and want to see what a deteriorating Eddie G looks like in his swan song, take a peek at 'Soylent Green'. Then go enjoy some fresh food while you still can.",Soylent Green
111,hackraytex,Very Thought Provoking,9,14 July 2017,"I saw this in 1973 and listed it in my list of movies that I had seen and could not find. A very pleasant surprise that it was just shown on the Comet Network. One of Charleton Heston's best but certainly not his last best. A lot of people dismiss the work of this fine actor simply because his politics were not what they would call politically correct.I really think we would all be better off if our celebrities would keep their politics to themselves unless they wish to run for office. This is certainly not a forum to discuss politics just like it is probably never a good idea to discuss politics in the work place today. We all have the right to our opinions and should respect the opinions of others and should not crowd those with whom we may disagree.As for this fine movie, after 44 years, it still holds up well. I have read in places that there is an effort to remake it and that would be interesting. I certainly think it would be a good project for Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Charleton Heston part since a lot of physical ""grunt work"" is not required. It was certainly a fine farewell performance part for Edward G. Robinson. Rest in peace all of you. Well done.",Soylent Green
112,leftistcritic,From knowledge to commodity,10,24 March 2019,"Last night I watched this movie and I was surprised at how good it was, leading to a rating of 10, which I rarely give to any films anymore. The film begins with a montage showing past modes of transportation and heavily implying that we are destroying our world. Following this is the setting of the film: New York City in 2022 with a population of 40 million people. Soon the focus is brought to on the protagonist: Detective Frank Thorn
(played by Charlton Heston) and his friend, a ""police book"" named Sol Roth (played by Edward G. Robinson) who helps him get information on cases by looking through old records. Everyone in this society is barely making by (with Thorn himself stealing food, supplies, and other household goods from the places he goes to investigate), with half of the population of the city unemployed and so many people that it becomes a major plot point of the film. Thorn walks over people whom are sleeping in the stairwells time and time again, hammering it into people's minds. Perhaps this is a bit overwrought but it makes the point in this dystopia clear.Thorn soon investigates a case where a rich man, William R. Simonson (played by Joseph Cotten) is killed by an assassin with a metal hook, talking to the woman living with him, who he calls ""furniture"" (the sexist name for women in this dystopia), Shirl, whom is played by Leigh Taylor-Young. As he continues this investigation through the rest of the film he is apparently tailed by someone, with those higher-up in the government putting pressure on his boss, Chief Hatcher (played by Brock Peters) for him to stop investigating. But this doesn't work. As he digs deeper he begins to see the reality, including Simonson's role in creating Soylent Corporation (which makes Soylent Green) and that he was well-connected man.While a subplot of sorts is Thorn's romance with Shirl, where he finally recognizes her humanity (and perhaps that of all women), perhaps more significant to note is the subplot of Sol, an intellectual and former university professor. He visits what is called ""the exchange,"" where paper records are kept, a remaining body of knowledge held within a public library. He talks to fellow patrons, learning the truth about Soylent Green. As he dies at the film's end, he urges Sol to find the reality by going to the waste facility where the deceased old people and riotous people (scooped up by garbage trucks of sorts) are sent for disposal. But this place is no waste facility as he quickly learns but it is a factory. He learns the terrible secret about soylent green...He returns to the exchange but four goons whom want to kill him and shut him up attack. A struggle ensues but Thorn ultimately wins, saved only at the last minute by Chief Hacker. It is there he delivers the line that has made the film a classic since then: ""Soylent Green is people!"" while he raises his bloody hand. Humans have become the ultimate commodity and are slaughtered, then fed to other humans, showing that they are all ""cannibals"" of sorts!There are a number of other themes in this film worth pointing out. For one, the scientists (whom say Soylent Green is ""plant-based""), the government, and business are in cahoots with each other to sell this substance to the masses. There are some parallels to Snowpiercer where the ""rebellion"" of those on the train ends up being a population control tactic. Additionally, religion gives people no solace as even the priest is tired of all the people coming to him for confessions. He is later killed by a goon because it is thought that he gave Thorn the confession of Simonson even though he did not at all. While I still think that overpopulation as a concept is racist, I think that this film still does a good job showing how humans are destroying the planet. With that, I end my review of this film.",Soylent Green
113,nhlgumby,Frighteningly accurate,7,20 March 2002,"This movie paints a terrifyingly descriptive portrayal of exactly what I expect the future Earth to look like. Overcrowded, unappreciated, malnourished and downright lousy. Some people say Bladerunner is the most accurate description of Earth's future, and I say no. I say there will be flying cars. I say there will be no androids. I say the world is going to be Soylent Green.I like Charlton Heston as an actor. I once had the privilege of meeting him at a Republican convention. Many people from the NRA were there and my high school's JROTC colorguard was presenting the flags that evening. Needless to say, he saw our rifles, and kind of took a liking to us for the evening. So I got his autograph, and he signed another one for our rifle team. Anyways, I think he did a fine job at acting in this movie, but I believe any moderate actor could have played the role just as well. It was Sol who stole the stage. He did such a fantastic job throughout the entire movie at complaining about how life used to be good, and how there used to be food and water, and how foliage was abundant. And it wasn't until Sol was on the bed, watching the images of swaying tulips and grazing elk when I realized how incredible a job he did. That scene where Sol was lying on the bed and Heston was looking through the window as the images passed across the screen was the most powerful scene of the movie. The movie builds itself up for an hour or so, showing how pathetic life is, and idealizing how the world used to be, and then it hits us with large screens of bright and colorful nature images, so contrary to the nature outside at that time. All I can say to that is ""Wow.""Overall, this movie lacked a gripping story, but made up for it in all the portrayal of the future through the mass crowd scenes where everybody was waiting to get their Soylent Green, and the riot scenes where the ""scoops"" regulated the crowd. This depiction of our future is not something we should strive for. We need to heed this movie, and work to improve our living conditions and our populations throughout the world. We need to take warning people and better our ways before it is too late. Good day gentlemen.-Scott-",Soylent Green
114,robertmaybeth,"Charlton Heston at his best unless you count ""Omega Man""",7,29 November 2019,"Sometimes I wonder what makes an actor choose one script and turn down another. Bearing in mind that one of Charlton Heston's films before this was ""The Omega Man"" (which people seem evenly split down the middle as to whether they love or hate it, a lot like ""Soylent Green""), you can watch the two movies back to back and the characters he plays in both movies seem practically indistinguishable. But maybe that was the way the movie biz was in the early 1970's, actors probably had a lot fewer roles to choose from compared to today, so perhaps Heston felt he was lucky to get another leading man role in something that was bound to be at least a moderate box-office success.And Heston's presence, to me, is about the only thing that saves this film. The pacing of the plot is much too slow, very little of importance is happening most of the time, none of the characters (besides Thorn, the Heston character) is particularly interesting or compelling, and the great reveal is something even people who've never seen the movie have heard about (and no doubt that's why nobody's thankfully tried a remake of it). In short, this film doesn't age well, unless you just like seeing Heston acting on screen, and it's not easy to recommend watching even IF you don't know the big reveal - which I won't describe here just in case you really don't know it.",Soylent Green

117,knucklebreather,Interesting futuristic sci-fi that's still very 70s,7,13 May 2010,"I've heard references to this movie many times, almost all of them to do with the famous tag-line. This might have been a more interesting to watch if I hadn't known the spoiler years before I saw the movie, but nevertheless I enjoyed the film.Mixing police procedural with dystopian science-fiction, the film is the story of Detective Thorn (Charlton Heston)'s investigation of the murder of a rich and apparently important man in a future New York City where overcrowding is rampant after an ecological disaster has dramatically raised the worldwide temperature and caused severe problems with the environment, to the point where the only remaining trees are literally in a museum.Interestingly, the movie is not too concerned with convincing us of its futuristic nature through displays of fantastic technology - flying cars and the like - but we know it's the future because of how drastically different - and worse - life is for all but the elites. Overcrowding is rampant - we watch Thorn climb over stairways and hallways literally covered with sleeping people, we see rioting crowds so thick and regular that the police deal with them through ""sweepers"" - essentially garbage trucks that lift up and dump people into bins. The only advanced technology we see is in the apartments of the elite, and even there, the phones are corded and things are not terribly 'futuristic'.The movie strikes me as being as much a period piece about the 1970s as it is a sci-fi about the future. Thorn's sidekick, the wonderfully played researcher Roth, is similar in many ways to the grandparents from the original Willie Wonka, of all things, and laments the people of his generation (the 1970s, it seems) who just didn't try hard, who had too much apathy, and ruined the planet, leading to the world of Soylent Green, which seems to represent a hyper-realized version of the worst suspicions people had about the future in the 1970s.There's a lot to this movie, though, and it's certainly not bad. I wouldn't say it has much on another near-future dystopia movie released around the same time - A Clockwork Orange (which came earlier and also relied heavily on Beethoven music... hmmmm!) - so I can only give it 7 out of 10. Its key weaknesses are how overtly stuck in the 70s it is (which is amusing but ultimately detracts from the movie) and the relatively stereotypical portrayal of all the bad guys as classic evil henchmen types. Very 1970s and very tiring. The pacing is also awkward early in the movie, introducing character after character that are important to the plot but giving us little context or transition from the last scene, and little reason to care about the new characters.",Soylent Green
118,parhat,Soylent green is Today's Fast Food,10,12 January 2005,"I first watched Soylent Green way back in 1973. I liked the movie despite the bad advertising and lack of surprise ending. It has stuck my mind ever since (I mean I must think about this movie once every month for the past 30 years). Forget the special effects, clothing, scenery, etc. the story alone will carry the movie through. This is a cult science fiction. Excellent movie starring Charleston Heston. I never liked this guy in any movie except this one.Soylent Green is based on people eating human carcasses without people being aware of it. While we are far from this premises, we are going toward that trend eating junk foods, chicken McNuggets made from parts of a Chicken you will never know which parts you are eating, trans-fatty acid vegetable oils, dangerous sugar substitutes which breaks down into a toxic nerve poison, chlorinated water, mercury tainted tuna, hydrogenated vegetable oil cookies, etc. Soylent Green therefore is a parallel with our society much like what we are witnessing the movie 1984, which concerns big brother. The movie is very thought provoking and the concept of us eating trash today is very similar to what Soylent Green is all about. If you give me a choice between Soylent Green Food and Today's Poisonous Junk food, I think people of Soylent Green got a better deal then we do!!! Look at us now, fat, heart disease prone, childhood diabetes, eating fresh vegetables with very high fluoride content and insecticide, and foods laced with pseudo-estrogen compound, etc., etc. You must see this movie as it draws some parallels our society today - uncaring government, etc.For what that movie did to my thinking in the next 30 years and how I became SO nutritional conscious because we really have to know WHAT WE ARE EATING. And this was way back in the early 70s before everybody got a chance to know about vitamin E, Linus Pauling's vitamin C, or that soda pop causes obesity, etc. You can say I am another Charleston Heston food detective!

119,VikiLauda,Progressive Green!,8,6 February 2020,"There is a reason why this movie is never repeated on TV here in the UK, & the reason being is that it cuts a little to close to the bone of the reality of today's UN Agenda 2030, which would leave the billionaire liberal elite uncomfortable & squirming in their seats!Soylent Green IS agenda 2030!Now this movie is very good but it does have it's faults, such as being hopelessly trapped in the 70's with a Panton designed furniture overload in the posh flat. The script is shaky in places & we are not told just why humanity has come to such a pass. However there is some superb chemistry between Heston & Robinson & their interplay of their characters is really remarkable. But it's the message the movie has is simply stunning, crystal clear & VERY prophetic. Soylent (a mixture of of Soya & Lentil) is set in 2022, in NYC with a 40 million overpopulation where all the people are dressed the same & would starve if it was not for the life giving Soylent Green bars. This is a Progressive, socialist welfare state, where if the masses misbehave they are scraped off the streets by garbage disposers & tossed into the back to suffer some unseen fate. The old, the sick & the disabled are euthanised & beautiful women are used & abused by elite men. Yes this movie is a very bleak vision of the future & to a certain extent we are living these times TODAY, if we take a closer look at what is really going on, with things like population replacement, abortion & euthanasia being promoted in western countries among certain demographics. In this respect Soylent Green is not just a dystopian sci-fi movie....it's a WARNING! This warning is not about the enviroment, climate change or even social justice issues. It;s warning us to reject socialist global governance ( run by meglomanic billionaires ) & embrace our true values of freedom & liberty before it's too late...Otherwise we are doomed to live a reality that in 1973 was portrayed as faction!EVERYONE needs to watch this movie carefully, even if it is just once.

122,Jsimpson5,A film that shows a potential future ahead of us,7,10 January 2008,"While I enjoy films, I tend to think that movie plots could potentially happen in real life. This film is one of those ideas that could happen in the future.The film is basically starts out telling you that the world is overpopulated and real food is very rare. The film focuses on New York City and how life is dealing there. Half the population is out of work and overcrowding is a serious but unfix-able issue.Since food is scarce a company called Soylent was created and they produced a type of food source called Soylent and has different names for each based off the color of it (Soylent Red, Yellow, etc). Most of these are in wide fashion, however a new Soylent has come out called Soylent Green which is made out of plankton, however since the demand for it is greater than the supply Soylent green can only be obtained once a week.Charlton Heston plays a cop who investigates the murder of a rich man. Over the course of the film Charlton's character must find out why he was murdered and what exactly the secret of Soylent Green is. Edward G. Robinson plays Sol Roth an old man who helps Charlton's character in the film. Sol is known for saying why real food is rare, and how beautiful the world used to look before it was heavily damaged by people.Sol serves more or less as the information man side kick for the film. He finds out information and is able to find the real secret of Soylent Green.The script for the most part is really good, which some characters seem a little 2-d but that is mostly overlooked.While the movie itself is fiction, it does ask a very important question. Is this a potential future for the world we live in? It's possible that something similar to what happens in this film could happen in the future.Overall the film is good and is important to watch, regardless is you care about the environment or not.",Soylent Green

124,Gatorman9,Doesn't live up to its potential . . .,6,17 April 2020,"As I watched this, I found myself thinking, what a pity this wasn't made by Stanley Kubrick (or even Stanley Kramer). It might have been yet another one of their masterpieces. The basic story is not bad, decently-enough constructed for what it is, with touching ironies, fitting dramatic segues, and touches of symbolism in the right places, and yet you get the feeling something is missing, and emotionally it doesn't quite come to together for the impact it could have and should have had. The whole time I watched it I couldn't escape imagining what it would have been like to read this story in novel-form, where I could just picture how much more emotional impact that could have had then what I was seeing. What could have been evocative like Orwell's *1984* or Bradbury's *Fahrenheit* 451 fell well short of any such mark.Trying to figure out the cause, I came up with two things to begin with: Cinematography and casting. Recently I ran across some film professional (probably reviewing the original 1962 version of ON THE BEACH) lamenting the demise of black & white photography and how that development essentially ruined certain kinds of films, and this movie would be one of them. There are certain Twilight-Zonish contradictory juxtapositions here that just don't work with the same power that black & white could have brought to bear. Even without black & white cinematography, a washed-out color or some other surrealistic technique was needed to create the bleak mood needed to achieve the impact you would expect this story to be looking for, and it simply is not there, and so too neither is the appropriate emotional impact. Instead, it is filmed in a way essential hum-drum for an early 1970's action picture.And that leads me to the casting. Charleton Heston was not the best actor for this kind of story, as it should have been told. He was not just miscast, but fundamentally miscast. What the story behind this movie needed was an everyman-hero actor, not an action hero de jure with the strongest melodramatic instincts in the movie business. Similarly, although Edward G. Robinson is one of my favorite ""Golden Age"" actors, and it was great to see him at work again, he came off as about as ethnically New York Jewish as Sam Elliot, and not only did not even attempt the dialect needed for some of his lines to work properly, but he repeatedly proved himself unable even to properly pronounce ""l'chaim"". Without this kind of texturing this movie cannot but fall short of any kind of greatness, however much potential its story had.Moreover, the sex and violence were poorly employed in this movie, distracting rather than enhancing of the point of the story. This is not to say that sex and violence had no place in this story; those themes certainly could be employed to enhance the main theme, but here not just any violence but the sex in particular came across as more gratuitous than anything else, just a sop to the masses for low-grade entertainment in place of something that enhances the sense of the degradation of human life that is fundamentally the basic theme of this movie.The result is that this movie does not pay off as it could have and should have because (not unlike any number of other movies that don't pay off when they should have) it is schizophrenic; it can't make up its mind what it is, and so it winds up being a jack of all trades and master of none. It comes off as trying to combine a heavy theme of the degradation of not only the planet, but the human race in general, the cheapening of human life to the level of garbage, with a much shallower action-movie thrill-ride, and in the end accomplishes neither goal completely. Therefore, despite an otherwise heroic try, I can only give it my normal idea of a 6-star IMDb rating: not incompetent but not a must-see effort either.",Soylent Green
125,redtiago,Cool cult movie from the 70´s,6,22 October 2021,"Soylent Green by Ricard FleicherA sci-fi/Crime thriller based on the sc-fi novel ""Make room! Make Room!"" of Harry Harrison but with many artistic and historical freedoms.It's about a futuristic dystopia, here the future is 2022, in a New York saturated with people where food and water resources are scarce, in which nature has collapsed due to the greenhouse effect (1st film where this theme is alluded) and excessive pollution.The problem is that despite the importance of the theme, the film, as many of the 70s, good or bad doesn't matter, doesn't take him self or is to be taken, too seriously, it seeks to be another ""cool"" movie from the 70s. Focus essentially in the (non-existent in the book) police plot and in misogynistic entertainment, recurrent at the time, exponent of this misogyny the ""furniture"".There are several influences, the most significant being the evocation of the film ""Fahrenheit 451"" in the illiteracy and lack of culture of the population, with the exception of the relevant elderly people who still learned, the ""books"". And in the absurd narrative, the evocation of the book and the film by Orson Welles, ""The Process"" by Kafka.It became a cult film and the most memorable scene from it, a cinephile reference. It was the 101st and last film where actor Edward G. Robinson appears, and in one of the great coincidences of life, the character played by him commits assisted euthanasia, in a beautiful scene (for me the best of the film), as if pronouncing the ""withdrawal"" of Edward G. Robinson.It doesn't have the depth that the catastrophic theme suggests, but it's fun even with all the recurrent vicissitudes of the decade in which it was made. It manages, without the slightest doubt, to be a ""cool"" movie from the 70s.

128,mozli,Grown up Sci-Fi,10,12 May 2008,"Its funny how coming back to a movie that you might not have enjoyed that much as a youth makes far more sense and is far more grounded in reality than you initially realized. That is what Soylent Green is to me. Let's just get the honorable mentions out of the way. Lincoln Kilpatrick(who never has gotten his due) Dick Van Patten(yes, Mr. Eight is Enough in something like this)Paula Kelly(who was the go to actress for these kind of deep, trippy films-see The Andromeda Strain and The Spook Who Sat by the Door)who showed that she was more than a great dancer. Chuck Connors and Leigh-Taylor Young in the best film either of them would appear in.Charlton Heston He's a problematic Hollywood superstar. He was a devoted civil-rights activist back in the day. Yet he turned hard right-wing conservative. This film seems to carry both of those sides of his personality. A cop with a very soft spot. The film isn't for the faint of heart or those looking for a complete and reassuring conclusion.",Soylent Green
129,contact-125-651146,Outdated Movie,5,14 February 2021,"Some movies while are considered Classics, they can be considered outdated sometimes.
It's the case of this movie. The plot was very interesting, even for today but the acting sometimes is very poor. Some scenes seemed to reflect the sexploitation of the 70s.
The best performance without doubt, came from Edward G. Robinson. The scene where he smells the food was brilliant. And his death, as well.
Charlton Heston's is another story. His performance was just ok. For an actor of his level, it was disappointing.
And the last scene of the movie didn't help him at all. Actually the end made the movie with a kind of no end. Having watched once, it is enough.",Soylent Green
130,uroshnor54,A Bad Dystopian Movie,2,9 February 2014,"What makes SOYLENT GREEN a bad movie is that the famous revelation at the end just doesn't seem that big. I mean, there don't seem to be many alternatives to eating SOYLENT GREEN. People might be disgusted for a few hours but then they'll realize that there is little else to eat.Maybe this might have been more interesting to watch if we didn't all know the ending. This is a movie that's been ruined by popular culture. The most famous line in this movie (Charlton Heston's revelation) was listed by AFI as the 77th best movie quote of all-time. Just about everyone who watches this today probably already knows the ending. I know I did.SOYLENT GREEN wouldn't have been bad if it had other stuff to offer than its most famous line but it seems to exist just for its most famous line. Nothing else is very good. Charlton Heston is okay but he was much better in other movies, like BEN-HUR, PLANET OF THE APES and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. I think he was trying but the script didn't really offer much. Everyone's already pointed out that Edward G. Robinson gave a great final performance and I think he did too. I wish I could say that his performance alone saved the movie but, unfortunately, there are too many things in this movie for it to balance them out.Quite a few things don't make sense. The world isn't believable. Why aren't more people dying because of hunger or illness? How can the government support so many people? I realize the filmmakers might have been trying to point out some problems with the Soviet Union but there weren't that many people in the Soviet Union. I can understand why some people even have to sleep on the stairs in Charlton Heston's apartment but why aren't there more people on the streets (especially at night).Now I really like many cheesy sci-fi movies that don't make sense. LOGAN'S RUN is an example. I like it because it does get quite poignant at times. SOYLENT GREEN is rarely touching (the most touching scene is at the end and I won't spoil it for anyone).Some of the exposition techniques were kind of clumsy. There's a scene where Charlton Heston is talking to someone through a glass with a microphone. There is someone by him (a doctor, I think) who can hear everything that the man Heston is talking to is saying. The story could not work if the doctor(and the audience) knew what the man was telling Heston. So how did the writers solve this problem? By having the speaker through which Heston is listening to the man malfunction. The doctor gives Heston headphones to listen through. This, of course, means that only Heston knows what the other man is saying and not the doctor or the audience. I just thought this was really clumsy. Why not have the doctor not stand by Heston to begin with? Sorry if this explanation of the scene was confusing but you'll understand what I'm saying when you see it.The movie isn't even pleasant to look at. Now I know this is a dystopian movie but there are many dystopian movies that look nice. LOGAN'S RUN, which came out just 3 years later (although it did have a much higher budget, I'll admit) looks great for when it was made. BLADE RUNNER looks excellent; it's visuals hold up very well today. The biggest problem is that the story is quite sparse. Basically, this is a 30- or maybe 45-minute story in a 97-minute movie.",Soylent Green
131,florida87,What The Blue States Of America Look Like in 50 Years.,7,22 February 2006,"This is about people who crave green crackers over the more common orange crackers and riot when the government runs out of green crackers. It's also about what the ""Blue States Of America"" look like in about 50 years. Yes, in this parallel universe the USA splits into several regions. This region is obviously the north east coast region (or maybe Detroit region). The message implied here is that big corporations are bad, and also the masses will support a regime as long as they can get a free supply of green crackers. No really its that big corporations are bad, that the human race is overpopulating, that the human race is over-polluting the environment, and that the future of the human race is not good, unless we vote Democtrat's to power every 2 years (well, maybe not that far maybe its promoting communism, oh who the hell knows in reflection?). When first shown in the 70's it had a large impact on me. Add movies like Silent Running, Rollerball among others (thank God I'm not remembering them all), throw in a weeping Native American over a land fill anti pollution ad campaign, the rain forest loosing an acre of rain forest every minute statements, and the green house effect caused by man (not by nature), and you were creating a culture of depressed Americans that has receded but remains strong in the ""Blue States"". BTW did you know that up until the 90's the blue states were always the Republican won states on TV but that changed because the left and the pro left TV coverage didn't want to associate the left with being red (ie commie red). Like that true life event, ""Soylent Green"", tries to influence the publics opinion to hate large corporations. Where it fails though is the whole society it portrays is basically that formed by a leftist society. The masses do not work, free sex everywhere, the government supplies the masses with food (ala Soviet Union), euthanasia is encouraged (oh gee which political side is fighting so hard for that?), the elite ruling class pull the strings of the masses (whatever else, make sure you give them the green crackers and as long as we don't run out we'll be in power), I mean this is a leftist ""Blue States of America"" future reality. I like to see futurist human race movies but this one is so blatantly leftist propaganda that it's lost all it's punch that it first had. Robinson is great though, and I like Heston so 7 of 10, its funny to laugh at now with those evil rich people and their strawberry jam. I don't get all worked up on the premise like you lefties that worship this stuff do because its telling YOUR future not mine. Oh one last thing, if I was in this future; I'd be in the tower with the furniture not in the streets with you stupid lefties smoking your dope and eating your green crackers, lol. If the environmental left was sincere about their beliefs they would focus on the rest of the world where pollution is 50 times as bad as the western world. It really comes down to the environmental left is, for one reason or another, either very naive or have ulterior motivations to see the west and especially America becoming weaker.

132,nvillesanti,A terrifying look at a possible future,10,19 April 2010,"I was always aware of this movie back when I was a kid when they used to play it on TV, but for some reason it didn't interest me. Recently, I was surfing through the channels one late Saturday night, and I came across Soylent Green. Although I just got to see the second half of the movie, there was something about it that attracted me to see it. It was so good that later I purchase it on DVD and I was totally blown away by it. Now, today's demanding audience, are used to elaborate CGI, big explosions, and mindless violence. In Soylent Green you won't find that. Instead, you will find an intelligent movie with a deep environmental commentary, especially for its time. The StoryThis movie is scary, but not in the way you might think. It's scary in its near accuracy and depiction of overpopulation. The story takes place in N.Y.C in the year 2022, where pollution, poverty and overpopulation have reached a frightening point. Soylent is a multinational corporation that provides wafer like rations for the hungry masses. Detective Thorn, played by Charlton Heston, is set to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson, a VIP from the Soylent Corporation. The murder was meant to look like a common burglary, but while conducting the investigation, Thorn notices that there was no force entry and the supposed burglar didn't take anything from the victim's apartment, concluding that it was an execution. He informs his superiors about it, but they seem to be part of a cover up. Thorn, request his friend and roommate, Sol, played by Edward G. Robinson, to help him investigate some books he retrieved from the crime scene. Thorn gets deeper in the case and he also becomes a target. Eventually, Sol discovers the disturbing secret of Soylent Green. The CharactersThe highlight of the movie, other than the story which is great, has to be the acting and dialog of the characters. Detective Thorn is cynical, sarcastic and indifferent with others, but through the course of the movie, he becomes self aware of the pain of others and we get to see him change. Sol is the soul of the movie. He is an elderly cop who reminds Thorn of a different world in another time. There's a quote Sol said that really stuck with me, ""People were always rotten, but the world was beautiful."" Shirl or the furniture is a young and naïve girl that has opted to become an accessory for those who can afford her. She is often treated as an object by Thorn, but eventually, a relationship between them grows. The ConceptThis is a future where mankind has totally messed up. People literally live on top of each other and basically live in every inch of space they can find. Natural food is a luxury, and even synthetic food is hard to acquire. The rich pays $150 for a jar of strawberry jam and vegetables and meat are a rarity. Society has become a police state, where only the privileged have access to curfew passes. The masses are treated as garbage, this is shown in a scene when Thorn is at a riot because Soylent rations finished at an exchange station and people are literally are being dumped into garbage trucks. But most disturbing is how the film shows how hopeless, aimless and godless people are in this world. Overpopulation is pretty real and it is expected to double in the next 40 years.The ActingI think the chemistry between Heston a Robinson is phenomenal. I truly enjoyed the dialog between them, and their relationship. There is a scene where Thorn and Sol are having a diner with the goods Thorn was able to collect from Simonson's apartment. You can see the how they enjoy their meal, giving you a sense of appreciation for what you have.Final WordsThis movie was made in 1973 and it does look like a 70s movie. It looks bleak, dark, and grainy. There is no advance technology and no alien monsters, but instead, the movie carries a heavy message of awareness of things to come. The ending revelation of what is Soylent Green is no secret by now, but I am not going to say it just in case you haven't seen it. The beauty of sci-fi is that it challenges you to think and rationalize on present issues that are happening around the world today.",Soylent Green
133,fletcherc21,A Sci-fi Detective Story,7,6 December 2017,"Set in an overpopulated future (2022, but it may as well be 2075), where the environment has been damaged to the point that farming cannot produce enough food. The Soylent corporation produces most of the foodstuffs in the form of colored biscuit-like squares made from soybeans and plankton. Detective Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) is a NYC cop who investigates the death of a rich executive of the Soylent corporation. He determines that the murder was part of a cover up and begins to uncover the dark secrets behind their society.Heston gives a performance in line with the rest of career and Edward G. Robinson shines in his final appearance as he died shortly after filming wrapped. There are plenty of interesting social commentaries about the massive divide between the rich and poor. There is a reintroduction of indentured servitude in this society as prostitutes come with apartments and are considered a part of the ""furniture"" for the wealthy. When pushed against obstacles like overpopulation and food shortages, society backslides and a few use force to dominate the masses.The ending felt rushed, unnecessarily so, given the film's relatively short 96 minute runtime. The first hour was engaging and interesting, but the last 20 minutes was a rush to get to the revelation. Thorn also goes searching for evidence of the wrongdoing, but doesn't actually bring back any besides seeing it for himself. At that point it is just his word against their's and they have shown no hesitation to kill to protect their power.",Soylent Green
134,stiv-7,This is what 70s moviemaking was all about.,7,7 October 1999,"I've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s; some horrendously bad, and others thought provoking and truly frightening. Soylent Green fits into the latter category. Yes, at times it's a little campy, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the film seems awfully prescient. Here we have a film, 9 years before Blade Runner, that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark, scary, and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson fare far better in this than The Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assisted-suicide scene is creepily prescient of Kevorkian and his ilk. Some of the attitudes are dated (can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the ""women as furniture"" concept in our oh-so-politically-correct-90s?), but it's rare to find a film from the Me Decade that actually can make you think. This is one I'd love to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, I don't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due. Check it out.",Soylent Green
135,Slime-3,"Fine, thought provoking Sci Fi",9,19 April 1999,"With themes such as global warming and over-population, this earthy,classic sci-fi film strikes a remarkably contemporary note. Charlton Heston (Thorn) is a detective in a future New York shrouded in smog and so full of people that half of them seem to sleep in the streets. He and his researcher, or ""book"" (a brilliantly touching Robinson),attempt to find the motive behind an assassination that the authorities would prefer to remain a mystery.The victim is a board member of the Soylent Corp. which controls world food supplies at a time of strict rationing and it is Soylent's methods of production which are being covered up.Most will know the plot twist here, suffice to say it isn't a huge shock ,being too well telegraphed, but the concept is so strong that it still leaves a  marked impact. The direction is suitably claustrophobic, gritty and sometimes a touch barbaric.The action scenes are well handled and the use of classical music highlights the most poignant moment perfectly.If the sets have dated,the story remains powerful enough to hold the viewer throughout and the leading characters are well drawn and so well played that the human side often outshines the sci-fi element. Heston has seldom offered a more natural screen presence, dominating each scene aside from those he shares with Robinson(in his final film).The veteran tough-guy reminds us that here was an actor head and shoulders above his contemporaries in Hollywood.His superb handling of the character and his situation produces a fitting final bow from a genuine star of the screen. At the dawn of a new millennium,this nightmare vision from 25 years ago looks disturbingly possible in the next century.",Soylent Green
136,luke-346,A brilliant ecological disaster of a movie!!,8,16 January 2007,"Soylent Green is a film that manages to articulate the threat of an environmental problem a problem parable to an ecological disaster and the notions that surround it from over-crowding to food shortages. The film depicts an undesirable, yet avoidable, future state of society.It is based on Harry Harrison's novel, ""Make Room Make Room!"" and is a detective story set in early 21st century Manhattan in which the greenhouse effect and rampant overpopulation have degraded quality of life to what is perceived as a point of no return. It is a world that has its rare luxuries reserved for the corporate class, it is a world that supports the greedy and punishes the poor and in a desperate attempt to ward off mass starvation and civil unrest, the government employs secret processes to tackle the mass hysteria. Soylent Green is ultimately about a dystopian society, a favoured film narrative of mine, and as argued by Orwell and others alike a classical dystopia is one that has flourished in societies besotted by greed, destruction, and death. Greed, destruction and death are themes that are employed throughout Soylent Green.Loosely the film is about a detective, Thorn (Charlton Heston), who is put on a homicide investigation that at first seems to be an opportunistic murder by a burglar. However, the more Thorn learns about the victim, William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton) the less the case seems routine. Furthermore, when Thorn's boss, Hatcher (Brock Peters) wants to close it less than twenty-four hours after it has been opened, Thorn realises that something is wrong and pursues the case even more relentlessly. As his investigation, and the film, progresses Thorn begins to question the society that he lives in (a common theme in dystopian narratives) thus embarking upon a quest of taking his investigation to the highest levels only to discover an evil secret. Soylent Green creates a world in which we, the viewer, are invited to witness something that can be perceived as being very close to our own world as it personifies the economic, political and cultural dimensions of our own and manages this by showing us a conceivable future society. Soylent Green is an apocalyptic science fiction film and as commonly witnessed in dystopian narratives, it builds upon the fears that there were apparent in American society during that era. One of those fears were that perhaps America could become like its enemy at that time a Third World Country on the brink of desperation due to its immigration protocols and resource depletion and in representing these fears the film manages to orchestrate a dystopian vision by utilising the idea of an ecological disaster... which is of course something that is common place in many Third World Countries even today.Soylent Green is a great addition to this genre and as usual Charlton Heston plays his Character brilliantly. This is his third film in his personal apocalyptic trilogy (Planet of the Apes and The Omega Man), it may not be the best but it is a welcomed instalment. Anybody wishing to see this should not expect anything too exciting, instead they should just sit back and enjoy the message(s) it conveys.",Soylent Green

My how time affects you; either you get wiser (most people become conservative, politically speaking, as they get older), or angrier (like Bill Maher)(and then there are angry conservatives like me). This movie is a classic case of A-list actors (Heston and Robinson) in a C-list movie. There appeared to be absolutely no effort to make anything look like it was in the future! If it weren't for the excellent acting of the two greats, it would have been pretty painful to watch again. The slow pace of the movie really becomes apparent in comparison to similar movies made today (it's a good, or bad thing, depending on your point of view; or how bad a movie is). If you have never seen this before, it's not a horrible movie, and wouldn't be a complete waste of time (and you would at least gain an understanding of the catchphrase of the movie; ""Soylent Green is _________"" (you have to watch to complete the phrase; I don't want to be banned for a ""spoiler"") I rated it a 7, but it would have been a 3 or 4 if not for Heston and Robinson.

138,chiluvr1228,Big Disappointment,1,3 December 2016,"I've never seen Charleton Heston in a bad movie; until now. Everything about this film was bad: the acting, the sets, the dialogue, the story. It is supposedly set in the future (2022 I believe), however there is no indication of anything that someone in 1973 might expect in the future. There are no computers, nothing to give it a futuristic flair. There are also no plants, animals, food, etc. We have destroyed our planet and now people are forced to eat crackers called Soylent Orange, Soylent Yellow, etc. with is made from ocean plankton. Or is it? Water is limited and only the rich have showers and food. A jar of strawberry jam is $150.The sets were especially bad, didn't even begin to look real and even Heston was just awful as the policeman Thorne who doesn't seem to be much better than a common thief. He is investigating the murder of some rich guy named Simonson who was murdered and he takes a lot of stuff away with him after perusing the murder scene. While there he meets & beds the ""furniture"", a young woman named Shirl who apparently goes with the apartment and who will most likely stay with the next rich person to get the apartment after the Simonson's murder if the new tenant likes her. People want to shut Thorne up and they are willing to go to any lengths to do so.

139,ewarn-1,Disturbing Flick,7,5 March 2005,"This was a very thought provoking film, especially for 1973. At the time it was actually a huge box office success. After the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely.It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time...no one had ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect'before 1985, and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up.The sets and special effects might look a little outdated, but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period. If you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense. This is a message movie, not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions.This was also Hestons last good film, the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy. After that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash.

Last April 22nd I was unable to find it on TV : (Whatever your views on 'Global Warming'; whether you believe the 'facts', or whether you believe the scientists who fear pollution is reflecting the Suns rays away from Earth, or whether you believe the only thing we know about Global Warming, is what the powers that be want us to know, and probably for reasons having nothing to do with Global Warming. . . whatever you believe. . . this movie presents a disturbing possibility. Pollution and ecological 'devastation' on a massive scale. And the future's not here yet, who's to say things won't be worse in 2022 than they are portrayed in the movie Soylent Green?

Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow and now Soylent Green. Thorne lives in a small apartment he shares with Sol 'the book' Roth (Edward G Robinison). Sol, an older man, has a hard time dealing with the new reality. Each night Thorne has trouble getting home from work. Bodies of the homeless cover his stairwell!Thorne is sent to investigate the murder of 'Simonson' a man on Soylent Corporations' board of directors. Thorne interrogates Simonsons' girlfriend or 'furniture' as she is called, Shirl (Leigh Taylor). ""He cried a lot"", she says. They discuss old people. Shirl looks barely 16, but, growing up in this world, it's clear she is the one Simonson leaned on as he tried to adjust to the new reality.As the mystery deepens friend Sol brings Thorne before 'the Exchange' a group of older scholars. Celia Lovsky, as the Exchange leader, gives the pivotal performance of the movie. The Exchange has uncovered scientific reports from Soylent Corporation. The Plankton Farms are failing. Even Earths' Plankton are dying. You can see it in her eyes. ""The facts played with his sanity"", she says of Simonson. ""The Corporation feared he had become unstable"". Are their kind doomed to extinction? The tasty Soylent Green wafers needed may become in short supply.Thorne discovers Simonson had confessed to a priest Father Paul (Lincoln Kilpatrick). It becomes a race to find him before the corporation does. Thorne finds the priest confused and in a daze, Father Paul has definitely taken Simonsons' confession, just then the assassin strikes again killing the priest.Thorne returns home to find a note left for him by Sol saying he's gone home. The truth is too much for Sol. Thorne rushes to a nearby 'sleep (Euthanasia) center', but it's too late. Sols not dead yet but he's already taken the fatal dose. This was Edward G Robinsons' (Sol) last movie, he was suffering from terminal cancer. It's said the tears Robinson and Heston cry are real.Sols' body gets dumped in a dump truck along with the others and Thorne jumps up on the truck to follow.

The bodies are being processed, and at the end of the assembly line emerges, Soylent Green!Thorne is spotted by security. He manages to escape but is shot.

Personally, I didn't take this to be condemning a world of haves & have-nots but as a sign, even in this crappy future there would be advances. Maybe I just wanted to play the video game.

There was not much life to this film, save a few brief moments of Charlton Heston's occasional passionate delivery. I felt embarrassed for Chuck more than a few times while watching, his having signed on to this hunk of canned... ham, I guess? I kept having to forgive its datedness as well. I really dig sci-fi but this was total cheese. I am guessing most of the budget went to paying Chuck instead of things like set, wardrobe, and directing the acting. Also, all the action in this film is pretty much entirely in the trailer, which was actually put together a heck of a lot better than the whole film itself. I kept waiting for interesting turns but they were few and far between. It was mostly dialogue sprinkled with the occasional Newspeak-of-sorts amidst vapid detective work.

I contemplated a 10, even though there are other superior science fiction films. Soylent Green hasn't aged well and its depicted technology was an anachronism for the year 2022. The book and the movie did not attempt to depict what technology could have been in the year 2022 because that wasn't the point of the movie. The movie was an environmental warning. I gave this movie a 9 because every pre-teen in America should be made to watch this movie. I believe watching Soylent Green makes a young person possibly more responsible for the environment and far more appreciative of the food his or her parents work so hard to put on the table.
As a result of watching Soylent Green as a young teenager, I now appreciate all food served to me, whether by my mother, friends, or purchased. I could go to a friend's house and be served the toughest cow meat by the mother and I would relish it as if it were filet mignon. Soylent Green makes one appreciate the real, delicious food we take for granted in our lives. Everyone knows what Soylent Green is about. It's a national movie icon so I'm not giving away anything that nobody knows. Everyone knows without spoilers that the movie is about everyone having to eat mass-produced, synthesized food squares. Now I won't go further into the story. Other people have already done it. In this dystopian future, only the very wealthy can afford real food. Most Americans under age 35 have never eaten real meat. The scene where the local food grocer shows Shirl and her bodyguard a rare slice of raw, uncooked steak will make a lasting impression on your mind. You'll never forget it. You will become hungry watching this movie. You will come away from this movie as a nouveau-environmentalist. You will NOT waste food again. You will be less picky and less finicky about your food. You will be far more appreciative of the good fortune today to eat real food and meat everyday upon demand. In short, SOYLENT GREEN has the capability to make everyone who watches it a more responsible, more ethical citizen.",Soylent Green
144,albertoveronese,Never forget the world as it once was,10,1 December 2010,"Richard Fleischer's Soylent Green (1973) is one of my favorite film. One of the truly unforgettable moments in cinema film history is here in all its brilliance and glory: it is the scene in the death chamber, when Thorn (Charlton Heston) shares Sol Roth's (Edward G. Robinson) dying moment and his last remembering of the world as it once was. It overwhelms me each time I watch it, because it's a magnificent hymn to what cinema really is and can force out; a film projected on a large screen reveals the majestic natural beauty of our earth, a film exposes the unbelievable atrocities and devastation around us, a film unveils the beauty in a human being... In his dying breath Roth says to Thor: – ""Can you see it?"" and ""Isn't it beautiful?"" It's only from this moment on that Thor can realize what he and the rest of the world have lost, it's only from this moment on that Thor can fight for a better tomorrow and truly understand his friend... it is only from this moment on that we (the audience) can rightfully disclose the subtleties and power of the film we're just watching!",Soylent Green

I have seen it at least three times, and found the film compelling viewing.

It is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted.  That's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition.  It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: ""1984"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's ""I Robot"" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).",Soylent Green

It's true he does action quite well, see the Omega Man or The Wreck of the Mary Deare. Although in ""the Wreck.."" he seemed like he was having some trouble restraining his natural acting exuberance.In Soylent, he's good. The design was interesting with very strong overtones of a communist/socialist regime in the costumes worn. Very Mao! Now, the problems. Starting with a minor one: Why were the stair wells always jammed with dislocated people? The big problem. This movie's is so sexist it's hard to believe. Women are reduced to furniture, literally, they come with your apartment (if you like them, if you don't just order up another). Second, Heston's use of such a women is disgusting. Stealing food and drink is one thing, just assuming you can order a women into bed and then then do what you want is bizarre and morally reprehensible.That's why it's a hippy's wet dream. Big Companies are corrupt, the environment is rooted due to Global Warming, and the women are furniture.",Soylent Green
149,xterminal,Dangerously close to schlock... but brilliant nonetheless,9,15 February 2001,"Soylent Green (Richard Fleischer, 1973)So what's the difference between schlock and one of the 100 best films ever made? Sometimes, I'll admit, it's a pretty blurry line. That's the case with this gem from the Richard Fleischer stable, a tale of a New York City with a population of forty million and a food supply that comes in little squares of red, yellow, and green.Thorn (Heston) chews scenery. Roth (Edward G. Robinson) spends his life moaning about how things were better in the seventies. (If only they knew.) The two of them try to get through their lives scavenging from the rich, like everyone else in New York. They have an edge, with Thorn being a cop who treats corruption like a comfortable pair of undershorts. A high society murder tips Thorn off that all may not be well with Soylent, the company that makes the majority of the world's food supply, and Thorn and Roth start digging deeper despite warnings from the victim's old bodyguard (Stephen Young) and Thorn's lieutanant (Brock Peters). The production values are strictly seventies, and it's great to poke fun at various things in the film (""my god, it's 2022 and they're still listening to bad lounge music?""). And yet there's something undefinable about this film that propels it from the realm of bad seventies science-fiction exploitation into the realm of true genius. What that thing is, I don't know; when I figure it out, I'll tell you. But something clicked. Heston's patented god-guns-and-guts character is perfect for the role. Robinson actually looks convincing salivating over a stick of celery. And somehow the movie's last lines are delivered convincingly. It's incredible. Whatever magic they managed to make with this one, Hollywood needs to make more of it. **** 1/2",Soylent Green
150,MovieManiacX,A 70's Sci-Fi Classic!!!,9,28 May 2005,"Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. Let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...Soylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much. It had likable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the macho-est macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feel. You're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of badass, yet likable tough-guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of ""furniture"" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the ""scoops"" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.One final note is the ending, which even now still shocked me. It is gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea.The Bottom Line: An excellent 70's Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy.",Soylent Green

The movie is so slow I forgot what I was watching and they only mention soylent green in the last 25 minutes and the last 15 minutes is really the only relevant part of the film, the rest is just unnecessary padding.As others mentioned there's nothing in this movie that shows it's in the future(2022) not the 70s.

152,boomerchinde,Futuristic drama depicts a grave future,5,10 July 2007,"A bleak depiction of the future, with overpopulation, starvation, a dying planet, and all the other goodies to make you feel warm inside. Heston plays a cop at a time when cops are so important to order that simply striking one gets you a life sentence. A brooding and dark film meant to inspire change in modern society, this simply looks dreary to the eyes. Chuck Connors is the baddie, and a foodstuff called Soylent Green makes everybody's Tuesday something to look forward to. This things are enough to make you want to run from the TV room screaming. Edward G. Robinson makes his final screen appearance as Heston's friend who still remembers and longs for the good old days, when Bambi roamed the wild and tomatoes were something to cherish. A said finale for a wonderful star of his proportions. Still, he is the only bright spot in the film. The only eye candy is the ""furniture"". A soap opera love story saps even more life from this stinker. Heston needed to be more selective with the roles offered him.",Soylent Green

The world is overpopulated--that hasn't turned out as badly. The world is controlled by corporations--aha, bingo. The authorities work for those corporations and not ""the people""--another bingo. People are expendable.One of the interesting aspects of the society in Soylent Green is the subservient role of women, who seem to either be aging homeless, nuns at a church, intellectual librarians or ""furniture"" that passes from apartment lease-holder to lease-holder.Heston was never a favorite actor of mine, but the story carries this film. The sets may not have been constructed elaborately, but it was just as easy to use sparse, gleaming manufacturing facilities than build some vision that wouldn't come true anyway. Been to a bottling plant lately? You probably won't finish the film saying ""wow"" but you might very well think about some things, and that's a pretty good result.",Soylent Green
154,Adec,A forgotten classic...,9,16 August 1999,"A groundbreaking film in many ways, Soylent Green while not perfect, is a very good, very well told story which much like the book it was based on ('make room! make room!' by Harry Harrison) was quite ahead of it's time in a number of regards, not least of all it's frighteningly realistic portrayal of the future.One of the films prime advantages is the excellent sense of atmosphere that director Richard Fleischer has managed to bring to the screen, superbly capturing the feeling of a world half dead as a result of the greenhouse effect and vastly overpopulated. Poverty and even death lines the streets while the populace is almost completely apathetic to it all, walking around like drones, most of lifes simplest pleasures a thing of the distant past.The cast too are almost good to a t, with Charlton Heston very good in the central role of a cop, who just like everybody else is more concerned with looking after his own hide than anybody elses, drawn into something so sinister that he cant help but investigate it. Edward G. Robinson, in his last role, is nothing short of excellent as Heston's 'book' and friend, old enough to remember life as it used to be, and mourning life as it is now, while the rest of the cast, most notably Leigh Taylor-Young and Brock Peters, all also do well in their respective roles.If the film does have one notable flaw it's that the ending is perhaps a little too abrupt, however the combination of a very good script (by Stanley R. Greenberg), along with strong acting and great direction makes up for any minor shortcomings the film may have, and all in all this is very satisfying sci-fi entertainment that has, unlike many of it's genre counterparts, more than stood the test of time.One man's opinion. 9/10",Soylent Green
155,spinin,My Misinterpretation,6,17 December 2002,"SOYLENT GREEN is a good story executed without the impact it may deserve. There is plenty to appreciate in this dark portrayal of earth in the future, but there are too many elements that just scream out ""Messy B-movie"". A vision of a world where overpopulation causes people to literally spill out of windows, animal and plant life is virtually non existent, fresh food and water is only available to the truly rich, voluntary suicide is encouraged, the government hands out rations of odd food supplements (Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow, and the new Soylent Green), a jar of strawberries costs $150, and women are called ""furniture"" (they can be ""reused"" or thrown out when new rich tenants move into apartments), certainly has potential. The acting is strong from the two people that matter the most, Charlton Heston (Thorn) and Edward G. Robinson (Sol). Sol's suicide scene followed by Thorn's discovery of the recipe for Soylent Green represent the best parts of the movie. There is something very creepy about the way Sol is lead to his chamber. As he lies there and watches a film of all the beautiful things that earth once had to offer (still does to us), the footage makes its impact. The themes in SOYLENT GREEN are obvious right from the very beginning. An excellent montage, which shows the earth as it becomes more polluted over the years, opens the film.SOYLENT GREEN is similar to Heston's more famous PLANET OF THE APES as it shows us a bleak look at the future of humanity that is a direct result of our ignorance. It asks us to appreciate what we take for granted. However, it does not have the same impact. I'm not going to complain about film quality because that is more due to the fact that I had a poor videotape copy. Unfortunately, the film does have choppy editing and a weak execution. The story suffers from some really banal sub-plots such as Thorn's relationship with a ""furniture."" The movie lacks the focus to develop into something really intriguing and instead contains some bizarre, out-of-place scenes. It's best when it focuses on Thorn's investigation and on his relationship with Sol. The production quality is low and the idea that people have not advanced much beyond the seventies seems like a lazy way of not having to deal with wardrobe, design, music, etc. So while the story may be good, the movie feels weak and dated and Thorn's final lines, while delivered nicely by Heston, do not have the impact they should.There is a curious scene that I want to mention. It occurs when Sol visits the Exchange. I got the impression that Sol is Jewish, especially since I heard him utter Hebrew phrases throughout the movie (I don't know a single word in Hebrew, but I've heard it before and that's what it sounded like). From their accents, it appears that the old women he talks to at the Exchange are European (possibly also Jewish). In my opinion, the conversation they have about the Soylent Green cover-ups seems to resemble conversations about Nazi war crime cover-ups. Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to make light of the Holocaust by comparing it to the story in SOYLENT GREEN. I may be completely misreading it. However, the old women have such strange looks on their faces as they talk about the hideous nature of the crimes and the need for proof. There is something about that scene that just made me uncomfortable. I don't know if it was the director's intention to show that the story paralleled the Holocaust in some ways, but I got that impression from that little scene. Other moments in the film, such as the crowd control scene or Sol's death scene, appear to fit in with that idea. The film is clearly against such actions so a comparison to the Holocaust may not be totally inappropriate, but it may be a trivialization, especially if the director really did intend for the parallels to be seen. Since I may just be imagining this, I'm not sure what to make of it. Please understand that I have never stretched my interpretation of a movie this far before (Well, I did have a strange theory on FREDDY GOT FINGERED). I may be completely wrong and I don't mean to misinterpret anything.The bottom line is that SOYLENT GREEN is a poorly executed, but interesting story about embracing and respecting our environment before it deteriorates and forces us into some extreme behavior. Here is a movie in desperate need of remaking. A thought provoking (not action driven) and technically superior remake could have a much stronger impact. For now, if you have time, SOYLENT GREEN is just decent enough to check out, if only for the famous ending. However, don't expect anything too amazing as this feels only like a second rate PLANET OF THE APES, from beginning to twist ending. Overall, a 6 out of 10.",Soylent Green
156,fluna1030,An Outstanding Classic With A Message!!,10,16 February 2010,"...what hasn't been said about Soylent Green? This Movie ranks in my book as an all time favorite. I first saw this movie at the now closed Rodeo Drive-In in Tucson, AZ. in 1973, and still to this day, It makes me more aware of what's to come if we as habitants of this planet don't take more care of it and ourselves! Released in 1973, this movie takes place in the future and by now, most of country is in ruins . . . more or less. ""Chuck"" Heston plays a cop investigating a homicide of William R. Simonsen (Played by Joseph Cotten & like Eddie Robinson, this too was his last movie completed). To make a long story short, the ""secret"" of Soylent Green is uncovered and ....well, take it from there! This movie (if you know your actors) included cast members from other Sci-Fi pictures as well as well known ""character actors"". I just discovered that this movie is being re-made. In my opinion (for what it's worth), this movie should be left alone and not re-made!! This Classic ... after more than 30 years since it's release, is more popular than ever!! Also, the motion picture soundtrack has now become available! Before the VHS/DVD and the now released soundtrack become obsolete, GRAB IT!!! By the way, Leigh Taylor-Young is an ABSOLUTE BABE in this movie!",Soylent Green
157,vgamerdc,This explains a lot...,4,21 December 2020,"The year is 1973, White America is at large, pollution is a major problem, and Hollywood is going to make a movie reflecting its concerns and trends at the time. Enter Soylent Green, a movie starring America's favorite: Charleton Heston. Reflecting the pollution crisis of the time, the film takes place in a future decaying from pollution and tyranny. There's not much food left until now, when the brand new Soylent Green is introduced. Someone in the Soylent corporation was going to reveal the secret of what was in this stuff and thus was assassinated. Charleton Heston, a detective, goes on a crummy adventure to find out who killed the man and why.Overall the film isn't that great. There's not much suspense, nor is there much emphasis on Soylent Green and why it's so important to figure out who killed this man or why. Soylent Green being in the world really feels more like a background item, instead of the main focus, as the title implies.There are some rather nice moments in the film, and that's actually when the film stops trying to be a detective movie. Not coincidentally these scenes all include Edward G. Robinson whose swan song performance makes his character far more real, and his relationship with Charleton Heston in the movie more valuable. Scenes where there isn't really any dialogue, like the improvised scene of the two eating, and Robinson's death at the end... These scenes are why you should watch the movie. Just for them.As for the rest of the movie, again, not much suspense and it's a bit racy. Blacksploitation is on the rise, and is evident in Paula Kelly's role. This trend is also present in Heston's previous film apocalyptic film, The Omega Man, also a mixed bag. The most uncomfortable thing in the movie is the blatant misogyny throughout the film. I've heard arguments about ""It was the 70s"" and ""prostitution is present in many sci-fi movies!"" Yes to both, and neither is what makes this behavior inexcusable. Not a single woman in the film, not one whatsoever, is against the idea of dedicating her life to prostitution. They all bat their eyes like it's fine and they like it, when this is NOT the case. Prostitution in sci-fi, and other films, works, and they can indeed enjoy it, BUT when there is just such a blatant disregard to reality and another human's feelings... Just.. No.AND to add to it, even if these women liked it, or were drugged or something, Charleton Heston doesn't think twice about it. Our hero, the man who we look up to, ""falls in love"" immediately with our female lead... um, I mean love interest. And she somehow falls in love with him immediately too and they just go sleep together and don't want to be apart. It's totally unbelievable and forced and, I don't wanna say male gazey, but... It is. It's not like feminism was a new thing or there weren't other movies starring strong, leading women. Or even ""normal"" leading women. This one though, it just throw everything out the door...Overall, I give Soylent Green a 4/10. It's a solid reflection of its time with fears of pollution, anti-government views from Vietnam, increasing interest in Blacksploitation, and of course Charleton Heston being (white) America's hero/movie star.(Guys, I love me some Charleton Heston; I'm not bashing the guy, he didn't write the movie, I'm just bringing it up as a reflective piece on where society was at the time and how, given our history, how we got to this point today in 2020.)",Soylent Green
158,skyminster,Creepy.,7,1 January 2016,"I'd like to say first that somehow I didn't know what Soylent Green was about before I watched it last night, and I won't spoil it for anyone who doesn't know and is considering watching it. It turns out it's a bit horrible, really. It's not really a horror film, but just a creepy sci-fi film, set in a densely overpopulated New York City of 2022, where supplies, including food such as fruit, vegetables and meat, are scarce, and space is something citizens must fight for.Detective Thorn, who is thrown into a sinister plot involving the Soylent corporation after investigating a murder of a rich man working for the same company, does have some space in a small apartment, which he shares with Sol. Sol and Thorn's relationship is clearly strong, and is built throughout the film, until emotional sequences take place; however, I wasn't close to even welling up a little, as their relationship is not built in anywhere near the successful fashion Spot and Arlo's is in the previously reviewed The Good Dinosaur, for example (bet you didn't see that comparison coming!). Nonetheless, they are likable, and relatively, at least, relatable, in the horrible world they live in; as Charlton Heston does a good job as Thorn, who is the typical sort of cool, relaxed man with a slightly erratic style and an eye for heroism. But however a good job Heston does do as Thorn, he isn't as great a hero as the likes of other classics such as Luke Skywalker and the brilliant Toby Neary (Close Encounters). Nevertheless, he is different, and in a very different film.Soylent Green is dark, sinister and creepy; set in a world where there are too many people, and not enough supplies. Dark themes throughout and a general lack of hygiene shown, or respect of women, or people in general, and light, where all people seem to be slowly dying, develops the dark veil over the film, and the sinister feeling of general wrongness. It's an intriguing film, with an interesting story – at points providing through simply morbid fascination – that keeps you watching, though I don't think there is as interesting, or deep, a story as their could be, and it is at points predictable (which is odd, because usually I'm too stupid to predict anything!). Furthermore, though a clever world has been created, and the aforementioned sinister feeling works wonders, the film isn't actually particularly enjoyable. First off, it's too slow moving. It's okay to have a film slow moving if things happen throughout to keep the interest going, and it's also okay if every scene of the film builds to something, and has significance with the story. However, the film doesn't provide much action, much excitement, or much anything like that. Sure, they got the sinister thing going, but not a lot else.Indeed, Thorn is a good main character, and through him is told the strange story he is thrown into; moreover, Sol is likable, and a few side characters provide intrigue. But a lot of the acting is overblown, and some characters simply do not add anything to the film, other than a little to that sinister feeling. There is not enough character development on show with any of the wider cast, and there is also not enough development of the story through these characters, as they are just there to kind of say, ""Hey, I'm here! Things are looking real weird, aren't they."" But there isn't all that much to really enjoy with this film. There's barely even a soundtrack. I see why they used a silent score in some instances, but I think the film could have really benefited from some more looming bass, or some dramatic music, just to spike the senses some more.However much missed potential there is, though, the cinematography is spot on, and the sets are perfect; so the clever world created is portrayed in the best possible way.Verdict:Although there is a clever world created in Soylent Green and a smart story with a successfully developed sinister, dark and creepy veil, all with spot on cinematography and sets; the film I watched isn't particularly enjoyable or exciting. Yes, Heston does a good job as Detective Thorn, who is an apt vehicle for the narrative, but many other performances are overblown, and some characters simply don't add anything to the film, other than small developments of the sinister feeling, which is one of the few things this film got totally right. It's too slow moving, and there is not enough action, or a good use of music or sounds, which the film would have benefited from. Also, though there is a smart story at the heart of it, it is not used to its full potential and is regrettably a little predictable.It's a decent film, but not one I'll likely watch again.So I give it: 70/100.",Soylent Green

There are entire sequences trying to tell us the same thing.
I really think they could be a little more discreet in the transmission of the message, because it has been constantly placed on the table the entire movie, and we've got it in the first ten minutes.Anyway, it has a really good ending, that justify the fact it is a sci-fi thriller, but can't rescue the hour we left behind, and also I think we can attribute what makes it good to the source material, not to the screewriters.Not an outstantding movie, with a good resolution.",Soylent Green

Make Room!"" and inhabits the same story universe, but the plot has been altered substantially. More importantly, the characters from the book have been changed substantially, and for the worse. Simply put, there's nobody in the movie to like very much. Heston's character is sleazy and dumb and it's very hard to identify with him as a protagonist. I can see why Harry Harrison was so disappointed. If you liked this movie even a little and would have preferred that it have more depth, better characters, a more gripping plot, and less footage of Charlton Heston swaggering around in that stOOOOOOpid hat, read ""Make Room! Make Room!"" by Harry Harrison.",Soylent Green

A world vastly overpopulated, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder, opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance.One of the images that will always stay with me from this film, is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne (Heston) has to hop through them every time he uses them.The movie's use of music is note worthy too, although it contains no score in the usual sense, The opening theme is good, and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric.",Soylent Green

This was predicted long ago by Malthus, and doomsday Heston is there with Eddie Robinson in his final role, and he makes this movie a real gem. His final scene, with Orange as his favorite color, is an unforgettable moment and Heston plays brilliantly off it. Also, Brock Peters as his Police Lieutenant is very good, and was a friend of Hestons who appeared in 2 other of his movies including Major Dundee, a vastly underrated western. But with several novelties, and without too many special effects, this movie is pure sci-fi by the acting and the story, and the final sequence. LINCOLN KILPATRICK as the Priest is the other supporting Gem. The blank expression and horror at the truth he heard show clearly on his face, and is one of those unforgettable moments. But this is one of Heston's best roles, and he plays a sweating, clever cop of the future with no inkling of the beauty that was earth of the past perfectly.",Soylent Green

The big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working. It really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more. Charlton Heston does a good job, as do all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film which was surprising. It lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main fault that I could find was that I didn't want the film to end when it did, I would have liked to see what happened next.7/10",Soylent Green
169,kirbyskay2012,Terrific movie that is even more relevant today.,10,31 May 2013,"I saw this movie for the first time at a drive-in theatre, where my friend and I had taken our two little boys (in PJs) to a dusk-to-dawn movie marathon. Soylent Green was shown at midnight, after the family friendly main features.This story was brand new to me and I found it quite disturbing, but not for its major twist near the end. What really upset me was the general theme of unconscious overuse which led up to the conclusion. Homelessness was only then starting to spread to medium sized metropolitan areas but it was obvious that the future quality of living portrayed in this story is not a fantasy but almost a forgone conclusion, unless people as individuals really start thinking about the future as a consequence of their actions today.Edward G Robinson's last scene was so well done, in part due to his knowledge of his own terminal illness which took his life quite shortly after this production ended. Celia Lovsky and Joseph Cotten delivered their performances equally well, as their own long careers came to an end not long after as well, and there was a poignancy and profound sadness to their roles that one rarely sees on the big screen.I loved every single production element in Soylent Green. The casting was excellent, especially the addition of the elderly actors from the 1940s who provided an air of authenticity to those who were in their prime in 1973. The opening credits were a perfect introduction to the story, showing the ultimate cost of progress without a doubt. The production values were realistic and not afraid to show the gritty side of life and the scattered centers that may truly become our reality. If we do not soon halt the relentless population growth and continue to haphazardly birth baby after baby, regardless of the strain on resources and finances, then we will reap what we have truly sown.This story is prophetic, realistic, heartbreaking, and inspirational, despite its overall theme of hopelessness for the future. The apathy of today's society could use a real wake up call, and this story could serve that purpose. I recommend watching it as a family, even with the little ones (who probably will not catch onto the ultimate message). Let it form the basis of a discussion of the environment and the need for all people see the future based on our actions of today, so a drastic scenario such as this might be escaped.",Soylent Green
170,Arsenic Drone,Excellent atmosphere film with a suspenseful plot.,8,22 March 2004,"Soylent Green has two flaws: one, the future looks like an exaggerated version of the 1970s; and two, most people know the ending before seeing it.However, it overcomes both of these problems. While fashion was apparently supposed to get stuck in 70s mode, and video games transcended Soylent Green's 2022 by the time the 1980s ended, the film conveys its main theme, overpopulation, very well. Food is scarce, and global warming has taken hold, giving most of the settings a dry, dusty look. What really works is how nostalgia for the ""way it used to be"" is portrayed. The film takes its time to get this right, and you can almost feel the intense anticipation and wonder when characters get to try real food instead of the dry food chips (Soylent green, red, and yellow) that make up their daily diet.The plot remains suspenseful even though the plot twist is well known. Charlton Heston does an acceptable job as Detective Thorn, who is investigating the murder of a rich man. As he digs deeper, the feeling that some people want him to stop snooping becomes more and more palpable, and by the end of the film I found my heart racing, without all that much action. Still, the main draw is the great way the bleak atmosphere is contrasted with fleeting moments of bliss.",Soylent Green
171,lingerer-1,Timeless classic with many highlights,9,31 July 2011,"There aren't many recent movies that really stick with me. I'm 30 years old (and by means of the average IMDb user presumably a dinosaur :) ) and I often wondered why that is. Yes I've seen a load of movies in my life, and it's no surprise that it gets more and more difficult to get impressed by a flick, the more of them you have seen. Is it the sheer mass of already consumed movies that blunted my senses? The answer is No (and I am very relieved about that). As often in real life, I was reminded by a counterexample what It was I am missing. The 40 year old Soylent green is technically (by that I mean 'visually') out of date. We know so, because many technical advancements of today are missing in the movie that plays in a reality 10 years ahead of us (I won't talk about the haircuts, cars, telephones etc., that's secondary stuff). Does this harm the movie? No, it doesn't, because it doesn't depend on technology. In a world where you have to cycle mechanically to charge your batteries, you do not care very much about iPhones or whether you should buy a XBOX or a Playstation. Under such circumstances, the problems of the little man are of a much more existential nature. Depicting this aspect is one of Soylent green's big strenghts. In times of poverty and need the value of human life sinks to 0 and survival is the primary goal. The means of doing so are not relevant. The young and pretty ones sell themselves, others get corrupt or thievish and the ideologically pure ones get crazy. Everybody has a price and you have to watch your back all the time. Out on the streets it's the worst jungle you can imagine.The intimate and warm moments between friends (Heston and Robinson) and lovers (Heston and Taylor-Young) preserve humanity in the confined little space that has left for the individual. The contrast to the dangerous out-world works well. The acting is very convincing, the dialogs are good and the world of Soylent green truly feels as a realistic one, one that seems possible to occur. Soylent green is an excellent example of a great movie. The cast is small and convincing, and the plot is simple and intriguing with enough time and room for genuine feelings. Further it gives the audience two important topics to think about: ethically and ecologically responsible harvesting of nature's resources and the raising of one's voice for the right thing. These are timeless issues every generation has to rethink for itself and within this context it's easy to recommend Soylent green for practically everyone.",Soylent Green
172,althusian,Lots of Good Stuff Here,8,14 June 2021,"""Soylent Green"" is a combination police detective story and science fiction/""eco-disaster"" film set in 2022. Stars Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson (his last performance) are terrific. Heston even cries in the film--real tears--and wrote in his autobiography that the tears came easily due to Robinson's very moving performance. Brock Peters is topnotch as Heston's police chief, and other players--Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Joseph Cotten, and Lincoln Kilpatrick among them--are rock solid.While the dress, hairstyles, vehicles, and video games are very much of the 1970s, the extreme overpopulation, lack of living space, lack of food, and assisted euthanasia were futuristic by the standards of 1973. The movie is notable for likely being the very first to call out the decline of ocean plankton as leading to both the death of our oceans and rising global temperatures.See it for the acting, the police procedural, the environmental warning, and the genuinely scary conclusion when Charlton Heston solves the mystery of ""Soylent Green.""",Soylent Green
173,ajudki20,One Of Our Better Dystopian Films,7,23 April 2012,"I'll be blunt—Soylent Green is an easy film to laugh at. From its low budget, to its vintage Charlton Heston performance, to the shock revelation, to the infamy of the 'Soylent Green is People,' line, to the very dated look of the film, there is a lot to tempt a viewer to laugh rather than work with it for an experience.But laughing the film off fails to recognize one thing---it is a pretty good movie. It is also a rare type of film---one that takes on an interesting moral topic for our society in a manner that is entertaining and lacks pretension. The film falls under the dystopian sci-fi sub genre, which I have a soft spot for. As far as those types of films go, Soylent Green has a creative and vivid concept of the future. It is a bit like A Christmas Carol for planet earth---'This is what will happen if we don't change our ways!' And frankly, even in this day and age we have not changed things enough to avoid a bad era sometime in the future. At every turn Americans seem to have a doom and gloom notion that reveals their knowledge deep down that trouble is ahead if we don't change our ways and solve a great many problems.Soylent Green came about in an era that perfectly exemplifies this sort of activist mindset, the awareness of what people do to the earth and what that could come to mean. As the youth of the 1960's rebelled and became more socially aware, an explosion of small causes and awareness niches took root in the early seventies. One of these was environmental activism, the idea that earth needed protecting, particularity from the trappings of consumer culture. Unfortunately, this idea has more or less been only at the fringe. But Soylent came about when these ideas were new and close to becoming mainstream. The brilliant opening montage is one of my favorites in any film I've seen. It pretty well sets the stage for the film in a number of seconds while creating a mini work of art which sets a mood of agitation under the rest of the film. However, this short montage is the manic build up, and despite intrigue, murder and the stress of living in a world that is shutting down under the burden of overpopulation, the rest of the film has an emptiness and placidity to it. We are disturbed by images a pea soup air, shovel loaders full of people, and staircases full of sleeping people at all hours of the day. But a calm loneliness pervades. Part of this is because a big part of the film is about relationships. This is both unusual for a dystopian film and what is arguably a B- movie. The acting is amazing. Charlton Heston is a hard nosed detective, Thorn who grew up after overpopulation problems took over. His roommate, case researcher and most importantly best and only friend is a smart, tired old man named Sol, who remembers earth before overpopulation. Imagine landscapes, flowing streams, wildlife, fresh and unprocessed food being only memory. It is a very emotional thing for Sol, and the viewers. It only becomes emotional for Thorn after a meal with Sol consisting of fresh food taken from a murdered rich person's apartment.In many ways this film is a police procedural with some sci-fi dressing. But it quickly touches on a variety of issues in a surface way: politics, class warfare, isolation, secretive government, gender relations, religion, spirituality, ethics. Most important is the moving relationship between Thorn (Heston) and Sol (Edward G. Robinson). It is a rock in the center of a society and planet that is crumbling. It is also the rock at the center of the film, bringing out career best performances from both actors. During the moving death scene where Sol checks into a sort of voluntary death program which involves a film of nature with music to pass to, all sci-fi evaporates, leaving the viewer only the subject of friendship. As the coda of the film happens, we are left to wonder if Thorn is more tortured by the horrible truth he's uncovered or the loss of his only friend in the world. Both point to how far humankind has sunk, or for us viewers, could sink.",Soylent Green
174,stewilliamson-13026,Welcome to the future,8,9 February 2020,"Very unique take an only too possible and disturbing future
Despite being nearly 50 years old it's aged really well and if anything the points it makes are even more relevant today
There are some nice touches the 70's fashion looks quite futuristic today and the overpopulation is no better illustrated than by the fact Thorn has to climb over all those people to get up the stairs to his apartment
The cast is top notch and how poignant that Edward G Robinson's death scene is the last he ever filmed
On Blu-ray this scene scrubs up really well both the sound and visuals and makes it almost plausible that in such a bleak grey future you might volunteer for euthanasia with you're mind like a sponge ready to devour those images of the beautiful world as it was
Like a lot of people I new the twist without ever seeing the film but this in no way diminishes the films power and enjoyment
So watch it and welcome to the future where we will likely be harvested like cattle to feed the stockholders of Amazon if a killer plague doesn't get us first

175,jeremy corbett UK,Big Ideas rather than production values in this 70s dystopia,7,13 July 2007,"NYC, 2022: The Greenhouse effect, vanished oceans, grinding unemployment and scarcity of water, power and food.. and New York's population has topped 40 million. This is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st Century citizens. The low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech 'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled American pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded Hell in less than 2 minutes. Succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise. The police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's TV detective show, and the other interior sets look basic at best. The budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise' the Soylent Executive's 'Chelsea West' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: They enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges.Robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'Home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.This is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s. Yes, I know we're not eating the dead yet, but with our resource-sapping longevity, spiraling poverty gap, corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change, the lasting prediction of 'Soylent Green' may come to pass.",Soylent Green
176,easeltine,The Population Bomb Scare,6,11 April 2012,"What I do not like about this movie is the usual over-zealous environmentalist scare of overpopulation that was the result of the book, ""The Population Bomb,"" written in 1968. The movie starts out with the idea of New York City having a population of 40 Million people in 2022. The population of New York City increased from 6 million in the early 1920's to 7 million in 1980. The whole concept of the idea that the population of New York City would increase 5 times in just 50 years from 1973 when the movie was made shows the brain dead mentality of these environmental wackos. I had not seen the move before. The movie is so not futuristic! It really lacks vision of other great classic Science Fiction films, like, Forbidden Planet, The Time Machine, War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and 2001 etc., etc. I mean the video game...oh brother. No, I think that the best acting job was by Dagon, (Robinson), dying watching this beautiful movie scenes while.

179,kathrynshelton,"A daring, although slightly slow film starring Heston",7,25 August 2018,"Soylent Green starring Charleston Heston is a very good action science fiction film, although slightly dated in my opinion. Charleston Heston plays a non-stoic character for once- he plays a detective in a crime ridden overpopulated New York City of 2022, and lives with an older man and they spend their hours talking nostalgically of the past. A company called Soylent Corporations processes a food product from the Oceans called Soylent Green which is nutritious plankton but in short supply. When a board member of this company is killed Heston goes on an investigative journey which concludes with one of the most shocking endings of all time.

180,BradLacey,Overrated,6,13 February 2006,"""Remember, before Star Wars, when sci-fi was smart?"" wrote one IMDb reviewer, apparently astounded at the intellectual merits of this film, the 1973 adaptation of Harry Harrison's novel, Soylent Green.I know, I'm supposed to be reviewing the film here too, but let me start off pointing out everything that's wrong with the above statement - sure, there were plenty of intelligent sci-fi films before Star Wars, like the original Solaris (1972), Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965) and Chris Marker's La Jetee (1962) amongst others, but it's not as if Star Wars set in motion an out-of-control train wreck of brainlessness.In fact, in the time since Star Wars, we've had Terry Gilliam's superb Jetee-inspired Twelve Monkeys (1995), The Matrix (1999 - the first one had plenty of brains) and Dark City (1998), to name only a few. Perhaps the argument might only be made that the genre took some time to recover from the action-oriented Star Wars, but the fact remains.The main flaw here is the idea that Soylent Green is a great example of an intelligent film. It's not. A dystopian look into the future and a bunch of unhappy humans does not necessarily turn a mediocre story into a great one, and nothing the film puts in place does anything to change that. Heston is his usual wooden, masculine posturing self, and the only bright sparks amongst the actors come from Edward G Robinson's last role as Sol, and the police inspector.The story is so well-trodden by now that it's essentially common knowledge, and it's not a horrible one. But the circumstances are obvious predictions to make if you have a pessimistic enough mind, and the ""surprise twist"" has nothing on that of the other famous Heston vehicle, Planet of the Apes.But the film soldiers on. There are good things about it - the moments of calm between Sol and Thorn are occasionally poignant - like when Thorn brings home rare foods - vegetables and even meat. Robinson's face tells a story that Heston couldn't approach in a million years. Affecting also is Sol's departure, staring up with wonder into an enormous television screen of fields and waterfalls.Unfortunately, things that could easily have been strengths are not acted upon. The film's sets are cheap and badly made - but where Godard, in the aforementioned Alphaville - used his limited sets and location shooting to enact a commentary on his modern day society, in Soylent it is a mere distraction from the story.For all its faults though, Soylent Green trots along at a fairly even kilter, and though its story provides little new (even, when one considers the amount of science-fiction literature around, in its time), it is occasionally thought provoking, and certainly still relevant - perhaps even more so - in these days of political unrest and global warming. Just don't get sucked into thinking Soylent Green is the bastion of science-fiction cinema, because it isn't even close.",Soylent Green
181,zereshk,Interesting premise...,4,18 September 2010,"...unfortunately it's about the only idea there is in this film.The basic idea of the film is a likely dystopian vision: In the year 2022, Earth is overcrowded and ecologically impoverished (not quite) beyond our worst nightmares. Apart from a few still-existing and heavily guarded farms, people have to live in dirty, disease-ridden cities, getting by of the mysterious food called ""Soylent"" which comes in a few different colours and which is distributed by food stamps.The film begins without any explanation of the background of the film, leading the viewer to expect the plot to reveal it. Unfortunately, it does very little to explain this. While dystopian classics like ""1984"" or ""The Handmaid's Tale"" seem to have been written with an almost eerie tendency to predict details about the future (for example, in The Handmaid's Tale - written in the 1980s - the US goes through a radical shift to more authoritarian politics after a major attack on the country that is blamed on Islamic fundamentalists) that hint at the author's ability to analyze societal trends, ""Soylent Green"" pretty much restrains itself to the basic premise.There are almost no ""telling details"" to enrich the story, instead we get to watch a sweaty macho policeman who looks and acts like every other hero from a cheap film from that era swagger across the screen for 90 minutes. One of the other commenters talked about how this film seems to divide the genders - men love it, women hate it. I don't think women have less of a liking for tragic plots: the reason is more likely that the female characters in this film are very, very weak. I know it's the 70s and all, but even then films could do a lot better. The only two women in this film who appear more than once are inconsequential whining victims entirely defined by the men they belong to and those who appear only once are only there to scream and/or get beat up. To be fair, the male characters are just as shallow.So if this movie had been a 20 minute long short film, I would have loved it but for 90 minutes it's just too thin and lovelessly laid out a plot.",Soylent Green

This is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.Characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect. I believe this is intentional, not bad acting. After all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that.I didn't like most of the action scenes, apart the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies.

It's the kind of scene that won't make you cry if your cables are wired wrong inside your head. Its like the end reel of Disney's Snowhite; you are deftly manipulated through your emotions. This is the place the makers of this movie achieved what I usually call ""touching the mind of God"". It's so masterfully crafted and then the rest of the movie is sort of a let down.

Robinson.Charleton Heston of course is incredible. He gets all the best lines in so many movies. Who could forget: ""It's a madhouse! A madhouse!"" from Planet of the Apes!? (You think I'm kidding but I'm not! I'm completely serious! I LOVE that line! I mean, how many times have YOU ever wanted to just stand up and scream 'It's a madhouse! A madhouse!' in the middle of your everyday life?! And Charleton Heston GOT TO SCREAM IT, my friends, yes he did!) I will of course spare you his oft-quoted line from Soylent Green, given that it will spoil the movie for those who, unbelievably, have never heard it before.All kidding aside, this is a great movie, even if you know the ending already. Aside from a few very obvious technological anachronisms, such as the 'asteroids' video game at the start of the film, the sci-fi is handled quite well, being mostly low-key as it is...Also, if I'm not mistaken, this is where the band Green Day got their name.

Looking at our world now, with climate change already ruining lives in poorer countries and corporate corruption a constant topic with political activists, the rain forests disappearing and not enough fish left in the sea to last us another 40 years, the near-future Soylent Green portrays doesn't seem quite as far off as it did when it was made.We probably all know the classic line by now so the ending is no surprise, but it's the journey that's the point. Heston's character isn't one of those shiny action heroes we've gotten so used to, but is a man with deep flaws - a man we may not even particularly like. This makes the effect of his horror at the discovery of what humanity has sunk to far more moving than it might otherwise have been.Just thinking about Edward G Robinson's beautiful final scene gives me the chills, and watching it never fails to reduce me to tears.And then I want to get outside and enjoy the wilderness, while it's still there.",Soylent Green

The concepts of the story are quite intriguing...overpopulation, lack of nutritious food, holding on to memories of a happier past, etc. But the film is mainly an excuse to show the violent, dishonest dregs of future society and scenes of scantily dressed women (referred to as furniture and treated as owned prostitutes) getting smacked around and beaten because that's all they're good for, other than to be at a man's beck and call. The only somewhat meaningful scene is actor Edward G Robinson's final scene in the movie. Sadly, it can't save this unappealing, barbaric garbage.",Soylent Green

This movie is more about the environmentalism that Heston, himself, was concerned - the overpopulation of the planet, which could lead to an environmental holocaust. The rise of global warming, lack of food supply, and an ecosystem breakdown could easily happen in the blink of an eye. You can see the effects of the air pollution on the city and the yellowish horizon has become the atmosphere. People wear masks, have little or no money, and they are eating Soylent Green - a soy product that is ""rich in vitamins"". The film takes place in 2022 A.D., which is not too far from now.Heston plays the part of Detective Thorn along with his partner and friend, Sol (Edward G. Robinson in his final role). Thorn and Sol soon discover what Soylent Green is and they must risk their lives in the process. I liked Heston's character as it reminded me of Harrison Ford's role in Bladerunner - the loner detective who is trying to solve the problems of society.A science fiction classic.GRADE: 8/10",Soylent Green
191,rossy_boy27,It's peeps yo,7,30 June 2020,"I was always hesitant to watch soylent green as I knew the twist, as most people do, without knowing anything else about the film. I feared there wouldn't be much to it other than that and I think that it would be unfair to conclude that after my viewing and yet ultimately not far from being true. It's a nice dystopian world they've created and being a short film there isn't much need for much else than the simple plot that is created to deliver the famous final line.
Charlton Heston is a little old (50) for playing the heartthrob but he's such a great actor you'd prefer it that way to having anyone but him play the role. I found his relationship with sol to be heartwarming yet sad simultaneously.
It's not unmissable and viewing of the last 10 seconds alone would be enough to pretend you'd seen it, however I think any fan of dystopias would enjoy to see a few diggers fling rioters, bemoaning the lack of food, into the back of trucks, like literal recycling to be used to make tomorrow's dinner! 7.2/10",Soylent Green

If you don't know what I am talking about, there is a good chance that after watching it you will say, ""Oh, it's THAT movie."" That is, unless you are one of the many whose viewing pleasure has already been spoiled by popular culture. Watching this movie today would be akin to watching a documentary on the O.J. Simpson trial and wondering how it came out. I feel fortunate in that I was able to watch from an uninformed viewpoint. I vaguely recalled there was something significant about the movie (which was why I checked it out from my local library) but couldn't remember what it was. Then when it was over I said, ""Oh, it's THAT movie."" With no expectations, the end was mildly shocking. Probably very much so in 1973, but less so 40 years later. I don't really think we are capable of being shocked any more.Unfortunately, it felt like someone thought up a great ending for a movie and then tried to put in enough filler to get there. Maybe that is why, with 10 minutes left, I actually said to myself ""How could this possibly wrap itself up in 10 minutes?"" Then it ended and I said, ""Oh, it's THAT movie."" Granted, working backwards from an ending is not a bad recipe for success, and even authors will tell you not to start a book unless you know where you are going. But it was a somewhat disjointed journey. The movie paints an overall bleak picture of the future, illustrating its premise with a few insights on how we've digressed. Some are somewhat original, but many could have been generated in a 6th grade creative writing class. As with all movies of this type, the aberrations keep us thinking and analyzing and there is a lot of ""could that really happen?"" going on amongst Soylent Green viewers. Most seem to think ""no,"" and I tend to agree with them. One puzzling and bothersome aspect is that there is very little exploration on how we've progressed. All the gressing is negative. I can not imagine a future 50 years hence in which our world looks exactly like our present-day world, only less advanced.Soylent Green is fairly typical of most 60s-era B movies. The acting is marginal and the plot is somewhat sketchy, but the premise is mildly cutting-edge. It is a vehicle designed to set you up for a 5-second knock on the head. There are glimmers of originality, and if you just sit back and allow the movie to move you forward, it will do so, albeit at a fairly slow pace. There are enough thought-pondering nuances that it is better than cleaning your bathroom. On the other hand, if your bathroom really needs cleaning, you could probably break away in the middle and come back for the last 10 minutes to get your daily dose of pop culture.",Soylent Green

197,kateskye,Soylent Green has an Expiration Date,5,16 April 2011,"Soylent Green may have played more powerfully when released in '73, but it doesn't stand up to other classic sci-fi films now days. Blade Runner (1982), the first Star Wars Trilogy and Metropolis (1927), to name a few, have aged far better than Soylent Green.This movie is in the same class with Fahrenheit 451 (1966), in which the film too closely resembles the year it was produced and doesn't try hard enough to imagine what may change in everyday society in the coming years. Soylent Green also suffers from having too little story to fill out a 90 minute running time, which causes it to occasionally drag as slowly as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).Heston is his normal, tough-as-nail self as he intimidates, fights and loves his way to the mystery's conclusion. Over all, the relationships and personalities of the characters are not deeply explored and that hurts the film further. How can you care about the characters' troubles if you don't care about them at people in the first place?Soylent Green is famous for its ending, which is still quoted and spoofed in today's entertainment. But that chilling reveal is what has kept the movie in the public mind and the rest of the film just doesn't do the dark concept justice.

His investigation into a murder case is going to reveal a hidden conspiracy that will put his life in jeopardy.The premise the film seems to be a clever synthesis of crime drama and old-school science fiction. But where the ideas are exciting and full of potential, none of them are fully developed, explained, or utilized.

202,fbeicker,Sci-Fi with noble environmentalist concerns,8,21 May 2013,"""Soylent Green"" is a science-fiction film from 1973, staring Charlton Heston and a brief appearance of one of my favorite actors Joseph Cotton (sadly, like most of cameos, not credited). The plot takes place in New York City in the year 2022. The world is completely changed: warmer, drier, overcrowded, miserable and feeding on the only source available – the so-called soylent green. However, the audience is not given a hint of what kind of environmental tragedy took place and brought the world to its knees.The city hosts an impoverished population of 40 million people–something astonishing even for today standards–, living in ghettos, separated by fence and trench from the luxurious buildings where the high society have managed to uphold a hedonistic lifestyle. They have wide access to clean running water – both for bathroom and kitchen –, whereas the poor are forced into rationing the precious liquid. The government and its elite are provided with every kind of food –from tomatoes and lettuce, to beef and chicken. By contrast, the poor must solely rely on the soylent green.It is important to notice that soylent green may possibly have some harmful effect on people, for they are always portrayed as lethargic, apathetic and even sick. Therefore, one cannot be certain if they die of malnutrition or poisoned by soylent green. This puzzle is partly unraveled at the end of the movie. That notwithstanding, since access to staple food in controlled by the government, people have no choice but to accept the unappetizing meal.The plot is set in motion by the mysterious murder of a high ranked executive of the Soylent Green Enterprises (Mr. Cotton). The crime is to be investigated by a police detective (Mr. Heston), who starts to be constantly chased around and many times nearly escapes from attempted murder. After being involved in a love affair with the ex-girlfriend of the slaughtered executive - who happens to be a slave, bought with the house, like a piece of ""furniture""–, the policemen follows a clue that eventually leads to the local plant of soylent green. After secretly breaking in the compound, he finally learns that soylent green, like animal feed, is made of dead bodies. The film conveys a gloomy message about the widespread unconsciousness regarding ecological issues in the second half of the last century. Yet, it proves itself impressively updated. However, the screenplay is overtly influenced by new-Malthusian theories that pervaded the environmental debate in the 1970's, which are now considered outdated by many scientists. An example of that reasoning is the book ""The Limits to Growth"", released in 1972 by the Club of Rome – an association founded at the end of the 1960's by world class tycoons. Similarly, many issues listed on the agenda of the first UN Conference on Environment (Stockholm, 1972) derive from that same perspective.The main thrust behind these theories is the idea that the size of population–not its behavior and attitude–is singularly capable of posing ecological threats. From this stance, the world's population is growing out of control and life provisions shall soon become even scarcer. Such ideas have prompted foreign governments into funding birth control programs in poor countries – an unquestionably discriminating foreign policy. No wonder in this sense why the film depicts a New York City with similar problems like any other large city of the underdeveloped world.That is not to say that consuming patterns around the globe are not a source of concern. Nevertheless, the problem is much more related with adopting liberal regulations and carefree mentality, than singularly with the size of a population. Many surveys have pointed out that bringing the American lifestyle to a global level would be impractical. Putting aside this debate, the message of the film remains unsound for future generations. Like cattle, pigs and other domesticated animals, we watch human beings feeding on their own specie, in a sort of death circle.",Soylent Green
203,kooklafran,The Callousness of Life,8,22 May 2016,"Soylent Green is one of the great sci-fi classics of all time.

Living in cars, on the street, and if you're lucky,in a cramped apartment powered by a self-driven generator and battery. Heston hops over people crammed on the staircase with such finesse like he has done a thousand times without thinking about it. Rioting people are scooped up and dumped in trucks like the daily trash. It's the norm.The rich live in a protected area in posh apartments with beautiful women referred to as ""furniture"". The past CEO of the Soylent Green factory shows some remorse and humanity by going to see a priest to repent his sins, but even he accepts his execution as ""necessary"". Just as Edward G. Robinson, the other character who has kept some humanitarian traits, accepts his death by senicide as necessary to expose the truth.Heston is ""in training"" ,so to speak, to restore humanitarian traits like joy, caring, and do what is right. At first he is as callous as anyone. Heston is an opportunist who robs the dead, steals from criminals who have no recourse, and shares his booty with his boss. Robinson shows him the joys of good food, importance of companionship, and caring for others.

The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies.  But Soylent Green is in a whole other league.  I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites.  There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like before.  Heston casually getting into bed with the ""furniture"" while discussing something else completely unrelated!  A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers!  A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor.  Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this.

The story is solid.The acting is top-notch, especially the interplay between Heston and Robinson, with nice performances also by Cotten and Peters.The music is absolutely perfect. The medley of Beethoven, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements make for some truly moving scenes. This was the icing on the cake for the film.And the theme (or the ""point"") of the film is a significant one. Yes, it's a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note it's a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with Man's stewardship of Earth. It's in the subtext that you find the real message of the film.

212,barrieca,Good but could have been great,5,11 December 2006,"Soylent Green could have been great but it settles for just being good and at times merely disturbing, but given the year it was made (1973) it does have its visionary moments. The dust bowl effect and the unrelenting heat (90 digress all day, everyday of the year) contrast badly with the term 'greenhouse effect' used during the firm to describe what has happened. A true greenhouse effect would produce constant cycles of rain and humid heat, not the never ending dry heat as portrayed in the firm. So in that respect Blade Runner is a much more realistic account of the greenhouse effect.One part above all perhaps makes the story not so much fall apart but disconnect is the realisation by Sol that Soylent Green is actually made of people. You have to twist this back around on yourself as the movie ends to understand how he came to this conclusion.After visiting a group of his peers (ex university professors) with several books that Thorn has given him to study on the case, they tell him the truth about Soylent Green, only that part is cut from the film. You have to work back to figure out that what is left of working farms, the scarcity of resources and the total population do not form a workable model for food production. Sol realising that man has descended to his lowest level, cannibalism, decides to commit suicide through the government sponsored enthunasia program. Thorn finds him just before his blissful death and listens to Sol explain the truth about Soylent only we can't here it. Thorn the embarks on a quest to the Soylent factory to find out for himself and the culmination of the film 'Soylent Green is People' Again a good film but not great, missing in the apocolyptical landscape would have been the constant disease or a massive plague that would have culled the overpopulated cities, no rats and very little in the way of actual garbage. Most of the dispirited citizens merely spend there time queuing for food and water when in fact at this level social anarchy would have reigned and a desent into tribalism most likely would have occurred much more akin to the themes in Escape from New York.A passing film, fun to watch, done again today it could be a masterpiece of Climate Change post apocolyptical hell.",Soylent Green

219,nicholasttalbot,More Relevant Today Than In 1973...,9,19 April 2018,"Of the few science fiction films starring legendary actor Charlton Heston, Soylent Green (1973), directed by Richard Fleischer, is perhaps the most plausible. It depicts a not-so-distant future 2022 New York as a city plagued by overpopulation, pollution, and food-shortages. In the film, the industrialization of the 20th century has rendered the earth untillable. Food is -allegedly - obtained by harvesting phytoplankton from the ocean, through an operation headed by the mysterious and omniscient Soylent Corporation. Their product, a synthetic food called Soylent Green, feeds most of the city. The plot follows NYPD detective Frank Thorn, (Heston) investigating the murder of William R. Simonson, a wealthy lawyer and former member of the board at Soylent. As Thorn delves further into the case, he discovers a disturbing conspiracy between the Soylent Corporation and the world's government to keep the human race ignorant of a horrifying truth: Soylent Green is not as it seems.
The film opens with an artful and effective montage, charting the destructive power of humanity's technological development. Within the first few minutes we understand the director's intent: to warn audiences of the environmental destruction humans are imposing on the planet. As a result, the forty million residents of 2022 New York live in squalor. Crowds of homeless bodies litter the sidewalks and fire escapes. Food and water is distributed through measly rations. Human 'progress' has pushed past the point of no return, where all of earth's beauties have been destroyed. Sol Roth, Thorn's good friend, played by Edward G. Robinson, remembers what life was like before the devastation. In the film he frequently recalls the beauties of the natural world, acting as a bridge between the past and future. His most memorable line is, ""People were always rotten but the world was beautiful."" The audience, as citizens of a not-yet-destroyed earth, represents the Sol of the past. We take for granted clean air, clean water and fresh food. To us, our environment is a novelty- something that provides some modicum of pleasure, only to be discarded when forgotten. In one of the more powerful scenes of the film, Sol and Thorn witness images of the natural world, set to Beethoven's pastoral symphony and Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt, just as Sol is euthanized. He says to Thorn, ""I told you!"" to which Thorn replies, ""How could I know? How could I ever imagine?"" True beauty, the type of sensual pleasure felt through listening to classical music or observing nature, is a mere memory - it is Fleischer's dissatisfaction with the direction of modern culture, being transposed onto a science fiction future - the idea that true romanticism is no longer appreciated. This scene challenges the audience: in fifty years will we end up like Sol, reminiscing of the long-lost awe-inspiring beauty of our earth?
The implications of this post-apocalypse reach further than environmentalism. Incumbent Governor Santini, has connections with the Soylent Corporation and police department. After catching wind of Thorn's meddling, Santini orders the investigation to be closed. An observant viewer will notice Santini's campaign poster hanging in the office of Chief Hatcher (Brock Peters). As nature deteriorates, so does the status of women. Almost every woman in the film is a prostitute, including Thorn's love interest Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young). She serves the men of high society, staying in one apartment as different tenants come and go - hence 'furniture.' These luxury apartments are stocked with video games, liquor, beef and even strawberry jam - something Thorn had never heard of before tasting himself. The poor live on the streets, in tenements or shelters and can look forward to eating their Soylent Green, which is sold every Tuesday. The film, which premiered post-civil rights movement, does not shy away from showing a brutal police force bent on riot control. Fleischer and company's pessimistic view of the future is a product of the perceived deterioration of the American dream, as witnessed by so many disillusioned Americans in the early 1970s. Government corruption, sexism, and inequality are not science fiction, they are modern fact, and according to Soylent Green things are only going to get worse.
The question remains, why is this film important for environmentalism? Why not just watch An Inconvenient Truth for the tenth time? The answer: how faithfully it captures the human spirit, for better or for worse. We are selfish and destructive, yes, but we are also inquisitive, freethinking, moral beings. Thorn fights against complacency in pursuit of the truth. As a species united, it is no longer acceptable for us to stand idle while our environment crumbles around us, nor should we allow the continued mistreatment of women, minorities and the poor. We have a right to information, and, in the eyes of environmental philosophers like Richard Hiskes, we have a right to clean air for our generation and our children's generation. In other words, do not eat Soylent Green, before you know what is in it. 
Not once in the film do you see the barren wastes outside the city or the dying oceans. The focus is on us, the human race - the only ones capable of preventing a Soylent Green future from happening. Now, the camera is rolling and we are the stars of the show. Will we step up to the mark and perform, or collapse under the weight of our own hubris? Let us ensure that Soylent Green remains fiction, before we all become Sol Roth.",Soylent Green

221,travis-46,WOW,10,27 March 2001,"I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video. It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and/or Charlton Heston films.Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective. I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period. Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen,and the cinematoraphy, writing, music used, and everything about it works. The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future. Just think how the world population grew, the rain forest that disappeared, resources used up, green house effect getting worse since 1973. I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years. Its reputation should be better.Speaking of reputations, often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors. Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.",Soylent Green

Just about every female in this film is either a hag or a whore. Some are even called ""furniture"" because they are included with apartments, like shag carpeting or toilets.The year is 2022 and the world is a hot, sweaty, overcrowded mess. We've run out of everything, including food and apparently room. People are packed in like sardines and a baby is always crying somewhere, just off camera. Everyone dresses in gray. The men wear pillbox hats and the women all wear those little triangular shaped kerchiefs that were popular in the 60's. (I had a corduroy one.) As for the riot police, the fact that they put little visors on them does not disguise one whit the fact that they are wearing football helmets. Do I seem obsessed with this movie's head wear? Then I should mention that Edward G. Robinson wears a beret.Charlton Heston (who wears a cap and little scarf tied around his neck to soak up the sweat) plays a cop who looks like he's been basted in Mazzola Oil. He struts around making sure that the masses don't kill one another when the delivery trucks run out of the vibrantly colored food chips which are all the government has to offer in the way of sustenance.Charlton really doesn't do much other than stumble upon the fact that Soylent Green is really. I won't tell you what Soylent Green is really made of because that would be a spoiler, but since this movie is 40 years old, you probably already know.There is only one reason to watch this movie and his name is Edward G.

228,roadracer4,one of the view films in need of a remake,6,16 March 2007,"Loosely based on Harry Harrison's under-appreciated sci-fi classic ""Make Room! Make Room!"", this film sent a powerful message of the dangers of over-pollution, over population, and over plundering of natural resources.This film which i believe was made in 1973 and stars Chareton Heston (not the greatest of actors) and Edward G Robinson (who plays one of his best roles in this film and was dying of cancer while filming this movie) takes place in an over-populated NYC in the year 2022. NYC has a population of over 22 million, people crowd into any available space and people wait in line for hours for basic necessities..even water is rationed (not too far from reality in many third world cities). Heston plays a cop who is investigating the murder of a high ranking official of the the Soylent corporation, which provides the basic foodstuff, tasteless wafers called soylent red, soylent yellow or the most popular soylent green. These wafers are what the majority of mankind rely on as their only source of food since any regular food even an apple cost for more than what the average person can afford. Eddie G. plays the most sympathetic character as Sol, the wise old man, who comments that ""people were always rotten, but the world was beautiful once.Although it is considered a sci fi classic, the film has not held up well over time and looks extremely dated by todays standards. Casting Heston in this film was def a mistake since he looks older than the character he is suppose to play. With the exception of Eddie G, most of the acting is substandard and a lot of the scenes seem forced and unrealistic. I would definitely like to see a remake of this film provided that it followed the original book more and had a bigger budget. The original film was filmed on a very low budget and it shows. A director like Ridley Scott could probably make a fantastic remake.",Soylent Green

One of the final lines mentioned 'breeding people like cattle' to make food, which is now horrible indeed, except how are you going to feed the cattle? See a catch 22 here?

I thought it was bad the first time, but on viewing it again, I found it to be the most boring, poorly executed, poorly directed and acted film I have seen in recent memory.

The whole process of encouraging suicide to generate food should have been explored in far more detail. The concept of the ""Exchange"" doesn't really make sense. And Heston in this film is just odd.Anyhow, if you've heard the term Soylent Green used in some way, you should see the movie and understand exactly what they're talking about.",Soylent Green
233,ulli smidt,"Interesting premise, but awful, cheap execution",2,11 August 2002,"I spent the last 30 minutes browsing through comments made about this movie. I simply can't understand how people can speak of this movie having a ""convincing atmosphere"". Granted, the basic premise is intriguing, but Fleischer and his crew fail in nearly every aspect to effectively convey the bleak world they want to portray. I will mainly focus on aspects of why I think this movie is a very good example of sci-fi settings gone wrong.First and foremost SOYLENT GREEN looks like it suffered from some severe budget constraints. To give an example, the DP tries to show the polluted air by using a green camera filter for each and every daytime outdoor shot, while a handful of poorly costumed extras should create the illusion of overcrowded NYC streets. The effect is plain silly and unbelievable.The film does nearly nothing in the way of technology projection. It is set in the year 2022, yet the housing conditions of the members of the lower social strata do not seem to have evolved beyond the 1950's, while the high society dwells in apartments of 1970's luxury standard. The most advanced technological gadget we get to see is an early 1970's ""computer space"" arcade machine. The same goes for the costume style. Charlton Heston's scarf and baseball cap resemble the attire of a steamboat captain much like Humphrey Bogart's character in African QUEEN. Haircuts, dresses, props, everything just oozes seventies atmosphere. Judging from the visuals not a single moment was I compelled to believe this could be a possible future time line.Neither is there a convincing demographic projection involved in this film. Nine years later BLADE RUNNER created a future L.A. society that remains believable to the present day: A multi-ethnic conglomerate comprised of all races, languages and nationalities. You would think that in an overpopulated 40 million NYC the occasional Asian or Hispanic roamed through the streets. BLADE RUNNER did a lot of things right which SOYLENT definitely did wrong.During nighttime we see Heston's character wander empty rundown streets, not the slightest sound is to be heard apart from his foot steps. Is this what a 40 million moloch looks and sounds like at night? No police sirens, no bums gathered around burning trashcans, no nothing? Pure and perfect silence?The script has its share of problems too. The dialogue throughout the film puts way too much emphasis on the fact that food resources are sparse, a glass of strawberry jam costs 150$, a piece of meat is an invaluable treasure etc. A rather clumsy, laughable way to set the stage.Conversations between the weathered Sol and Charlton Heston's character focus on the fact that Sol experienced NYC before it deteriorated into what it is in 2022, while Heston did not. Heston was nearly 50 at the time of shooting and doesn't actually look much younger than that. If you do the math his character was therefore born around 1970, which (if Thorn doesn't remember the least bit of his childhood)in turn would mean that the change came about very rapidly between 1970 and 75. A nonsensical premise given the fact that the U.S. already had a negative population growth at the time of shooting. Not even massive, uncontrolled immigration from third world countries could quadruple the population of NYC and consequently bring a whole system upside down in a matter of years.I could go on rambling, but the matter of the fact is that Richard Fleischer's career peaked with TORA!TORA!TORA! in 1970. Take the time to check out his filmography after that one. Not a single movie reaches an IMDb rating of 7.0 or above, most are below 5.0. SOYLENT GREEN is not an exception. It is inherently flawed. It's no excuse to say that this movie was shot in the 70's and effects and production design therefore look dated, Kubrick shot 2001 in 1969 and it creates a more believable setting. When BLADE RUNNER was shot in 1982, there wasn't any CGI mumbo jumbo, yet it succeeds gloriously in creating a style that still looks futuristic even more than 20 years after it hit the silver screen.",Soylent Green

She talked about the movie during lunch one Saturday afternoon with our entire family (me, my sister, my other sister, and my parents) present at the table. I got upset. I really regret being so impressionable and sensitive. The movie seems quaint and idealistic now. The mistaken assumption that the story (both the book and the movie) seems to make is that an industrialized nation such as ours would be overpopulated by high birthrates. Industrialized nations, as we know now, have relatively low birthrates and would not be the cause of an industrialized nation's overpopulation. If our nation would indeed eventually become overcrowded with depleted resources, the cause would be increased immigration. To this day, I've only seen a few scenes of the film (just the scene where Chuck Connors assaults Charleton Heston in Heston's apartment and, of course, the final scene).

""Try new Soylent Green: it's technically cannibalism, but due to global warming the agriculture industry can't provide enough food for everyone, so this is the only food you can afford. If you would rather die, that's fine too: may we have your body? There are a lot of hungry people out there."" Really, why not say that?Watching this film for the first time in 2008 meant that I spent the whole film waiting for Charlton Heston to scream the line ""Soylent Green is PEOPLE!""

Maybe all the spoofs and parodies of it colored my judgement. I started watching the DVD expecting some trashy fun.My expectations changed very quickly. The film starts on a very strong footing with a musical photo-montage that deftly conveys the effects if the industrial revolution, overcrowding, and pollution. There is another montage near the end of the movie, as well. These portions of the film are incredibly striking and powerful. It's some of the most evocative film-making I've seen. They are the high points of the film, and are so bold, that they would be reason, enough to see this film.The rest of the film is uneven, but is still watchable and compelling. There is a great deal of provocative material here, and it will have you pondering it for days. The film is set in the future, but most of the sets look very much like the 1970s when it was filmed. One exception is an apartment where the very rich dwell. It has an interesting white- hued futuristic look. The apartment comes complete with what, at the time, was a great futuristic advance-one of the first arcade style video games, created by Nolan Bushnell who went on to found Atari. It probably looked pretty cool at the time, but now it looks like a primitive version of Asteroids. It doesn't help that the actress playing with it does not seem to have a clue how to operate it. Her ships keep dying every second or two, yet she is oblivious to this and acts like she's having a grand time. Couldn't someone on the set have spent a few minutes teaching her how to play it? Despite all that, I thought it was a neat scene, and I was pleased to see that vintage game. I think i remember playing it!You have to make allowances. We are a bit spoiled now. Movies such as Blade Runner and the 5th Element have a fully realized futuristic world with all the little details shown to perfection. You almost take it that for granted now. Video games have come a long way, for that matter. I hope we don't get so spoiled by the current technology that we are no longer willing or able to supply some of our own sense of wonder. In Soylent Green, you don't see a thing that suggests a futuristic world for much of the picture. This can be forgiven because there is great acting by the principals, Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson in his last film appearance. There are also a profusion of thought provoking ideas. You probably know the shock ending of this film. Few people won't know this big reveal going in. It's common knowledge whether or not you've seen the film. That's not the main attraction of the film. Enjoyment of it does not depend on the shock ending.Soylent Green is not a trashy movie.

There is not a single redeeming feature in this movie. Given Director Richard Fleischer's long directorial career, he and the production team knew exactly what they were doing. The subject of the impact of the human species upon the earth deserves better than this money grubbing insult. Thus the reference to The Monkees, another money grubbing creation that said ""we can mimic exciting social creativity and reduce it to a formulaic pile of nonsense and enough of you will buy it to make our accountants happy"". If it did not insult our intelligence in such a slipshod and crude manner, I would recommend it as some kind of worst of the worst junk cinema. But it fails to reach even that warped low bar.",Soylent Green
248,mhamilton4-1,remake this movie and you will make big bucks,10,16 October 2005,"but you should include some of my ideas to enhance the concept of the myth in this film. It looks backwards in time to show us what governance has done in crisis and predicts the future. People love revelation. You could make a film that really gives it to them on this platform.The earth is currently redistributing water weight. Planetary governance will respond as it has in the past we must imagine. A new film on the back Charlton Heston is what this world needs.Aside from that, it would be great to find like minds out there. Being judgmental about film makes for lively conversation.",Soylent Green
249,jimoss,People are too dumb to plant food,3,13 August 2006,"I do admit this movie is consider a classic. They often made jokes about it in the simpsons or futurama for example. After seeing this movie, you cannot help but to make fun of it. This movie is so ridiculous in so many ways, I cannot help but laugh out loud. Like yes the earth is over crowded, but in the background you often see grass, wood or whatnot. And if there isn't forests anymore, why is paper so cheaply available. Plus think about all the Cotton clothing people is wearing. If your able to build a plant to turn dead people into filthy green biscuits, you have the technologies to build plant to grow food. Just think about the ways pork or chickens are raise now-a-days.... Thoses are factories, no? Anyhow, that movie is pretty funny, nut way too long.",Soylent Green
250,bigplans12,Soylent Cheese!,10,27 April 2006,"""Soylent Green is made of people. It's made of PEOPLE!"" Charlton Heston is one of my favorite all-time over-actors. Another good movie to watch is PLanet of the Apes. ""Get your hands off me you DAMN DIRTY APE!"" If this isn't entertainment is all about, I don't know what is. You know, watching this as a kid, I was captivated. The movie had a whole different feel. It was raw and serious and it pushed your imagination and fear of big government. Boy, those were different times. Yes, this movie is dated. Now as an adult, I can't stop laughing. Do yourself a favor and watch this stuff. It's so good that SNL did a skit dedicated to this flick. I Love the cheese. Pour it on! -bigplans12",Soylent Green
