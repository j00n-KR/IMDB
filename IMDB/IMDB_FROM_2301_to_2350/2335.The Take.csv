0,Leofwine_draca,Watchable action thriller with a Parisian setting,6,28 December 2016,"BASTILLE DAY is a solid action thriller made as a collaboration between Great Britain and France. I watched it under the ludicrous re-titling THE TAKE. Essentially this is a film in the style of intense French action cinema like MEA CULPA, with an added British cast doing American accents. The accent thing can be distracting in places but is far from horrendous as you'd expect. This is a short and snappy thriller with an interesting story enlivened by some great action sequences. My only real problem with it is that it doesn't have the drive and momentum it needs to make it a truly great film. The action bits are highlights and very well directed and edited, but outside of the action the story feels a little slower and more unfocused.Idris Elba is a suitably hard-hitting hero and given solid support from a likable Richard Madden, here breaking out from GAME OF THRONES. I could have done without Kelly Reilly, however, whose extraneous character seems to have been added in purely because the director previously made EDEN LAKE. Speaking of James Watkins, he's previously only been known for horror fare like THE WOMAN IN BLACK, but he make a good transition to thrillers here. BASTILLE DAY peaks early on with a thrilling rooftop chase which goes above and beyond and features enhanced sound effect design to make it one of the best I've ever seen, and the film remains fitfully exciting and watchable to the end, despite a heavy-handed political agenda in the script and various clichés in the story.",The Take
1,SnoopyStyle,Le Bond,7,14 October 2018,Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American pickpocket in Paris. Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) is an anti-fascist who is recruited to place a bomb in an empty right wing party building. Sean Briar (Idris Elba) is a reckless CIA agent assigned to Paris. The three are pulled into a conspiracy to heighten the political atmosphere for a Die Hard scheme.This proves to me that Idris Elba could have been a great Bond. The story is a good convoluted thriller. The only thing missing is a truly fun buddy chemistry. Madden needs to be a little funnier to make the pairing better. I'm reminded of 48 Hrs or various other odd couples. This is not quite up to that level. It's not as fun but it's a solid thriller.,The Take
2,Prismark10,The Take,4,17 March 2018,"Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American pickpocket in Paris, thieving to make a living.A case he steals goes off as it contained a bomb. Now he is hunted by the French police and a CIA agent based in the city, Sean Briar (Idris Elba.)They uncover a conspiracy at play to blame Muslims for the bombing atrocities while anti fascist protesters campaign against police brutality.The Take is a routine but underwhelming thriller. There are a few twists that involve corrupt cops but Elba is wasted as the maverick CIA agent who is frankly a bit dull.The film also has too many British actors playing Americans, surely the producers could afford some genuine American actors!",The Take
3,nogodnomasters,No. There's a lot more,10,27 September 2017,"Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American living in Paris living off his ability to pick pockets. The film catches our attention with a nude woman (Stéphane Caillard) walking through a crowd as a distraction. However for Michael, things come abruptly to a halt when he swipes and discards what turns out to be a bomb. His fugitive days don't last long as he is apprehended by CIA agent Briar (Idris Elba) who operates ""way off the reservation."" Is is attempting to find a girl and a bomber. Meanwhile we know the bad guys are the French police who are blaming radical Islamic terrorists. They have a map of the inside of a bank. The streets are in turmoil.I enjoyed the film. It didn't need a big twist or mystery to keep me interested, the characters did that themselves, often engaging in dry humor. I would rate it on par with 'From Paris With Love."" Guide: Nudity. F-word. No sex.",The Take
4,kosmasp,Don't mess with the Elba,7,20 February 2017,"And no I'm not talking about a river. The charisma and screen presence Idris Elba projects is amazing. He can throw shades, have a stare-down and just generally make you do things without saying much. If someone like this is on the hunt to get you ... well you better run fast. But this is not just a chase movie. This has unfortunately some roots in reality with its terrorist attack theme.This is something that is hard to stomach and might be too much for some to view, in light of things that did happen in Paris or anywhere else in the world for that matter. But if you can blend that out and just accept this as entertainment and a movie, you will get a suspenseful story, that is intriguing and decent enough to watch",The Take
5,blanche-2,A pickpocket is hunted as a terrorist,7,7 September 2021,"It's the eve of Bastille Day in Paris, and a young pickpocket, Michael Mason (Richard Madden) steals a shopping bag. He's disappointed to see there is only a wig and teddy bear inside, so he leaves it by some trash. Then it explodes, killing four people.Mason becomes a major person of interest as the CIA, led by Sean Briar (Idris Elba) captures him after an incredible chase. Mason swears that he is not a terrorist, that he stole the bag, and he knows the owner is named Zoe because of her phone, left in the bag.The traumatized Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) was supposed to leave the bomb in a building for her radical boyfriend, Jean. When she realizes the building isn't empty, she decides against it and dumps the bag. She is now a wanted woman.It takes a while, but Sean eventually figures out that he is dealing with two different factions, a group of mercenaries and a group of thieves.Fun and exciting movie, pure entertainment, with some interesting characters. Charlotte Le Bon reminded me of Winona Ryder; she does a good job, as does Madden. Elba, with his tough exterior and gift of rapid-fire dialogue, is excellent.As a long time film aficionado, I find it's best not to go too deeply into films like this. Take them for what they are, don't look for realism, and enjoy the excitement.",The Take
6,Calicodreamin,Not bad,6,6 January 2021,"This movie had a few things going for it, good acting and a fairly well developed storyline. The characters weren't particularly strong but some chemistry. The storyline had a few good twists.",The Take
7,neil-476,Le action thriller avec rosbifs qui jouent Americains,7,28 April 2016,"Skilled pickpocket Michael steals a bag containing a bomb, which lands him in a it of a pickle, mainly at the hands of disobedient CIA agent Briar. As anti-terrorist concerns mount on the eve of Paris' Bastille Day celebrations, there is a race against time to head off the bad stuff waiting in the wings.This is a decent, if unexceptional, action thriller. The plot is quite good fun, with some enjoyable twists (which aren't that difficult to spot ahead of time) and some good action sequences. Idris Elba demonstrates what he is good at (as opposed to his disappointing voice work in Zootopia and The Jungle Book) and Richard Madden does well as the pickpocket with a decent character arc. Both play Americans in a film which puts a strong American presence in Paris despite there being no Americans in the cast as far as I can see. They have good chemistry, which works well for the benefit of the film.This is an undemanding way of spending 90 minutes, but not much beyond that.",The Take
8,FlashCallahan,Statham must have been busy.....,5,18 August 2016,"Michael Mason, a pick-pocket living in Paris, steals a bag from a distressed woman. Not realising the bag contains a bomb, he tosses it in a bin on a busy street. It explodes, killing four people. CCTV footage reveals Masons face and the French police tag him as a terrorist threat. The explosion was set up by a group of the French Interior Ministry as a decoy so they can make a half billion dollar digital transfer from a bank, which would be closed on the titular day. CIA agent Sean Briar, discovers the real story behind Masons ""terrorist attack"", and the two collaborate to bring the corrupt members of the Ministry down......Another year, another action movie that seems out of time, because this is nothing more than a nuts and bolts film that features a gruff, grizzled, burnt out C.I.A agent, and a wisecracking criminal sidekick who is asking to be punched several times.Elba is wasted on this material, and although he puts in a worthy performance,the cliché riddled script takes out any urgency that the film may or may not have.The truth is, the film doesn't have any urgency, this film is a relic of the late nineties/early noughties, and should have starred Jason Statham and Lochlan Monroe, and even then, the only redeeming factor would have been the fight choreography.It plods along at a snails pace, the humour consists of nothing more than Mason antagonising Briar, which results in either Briar hitting him, or giving him a long hard stare.If you've seen any action film from any decade, you've seen the majority of this film.So part from seeing Elba audition for Bond, there's nothing to see here.",The Take
9,phd_travel,Entertaining thriller - and by the way Keep you valuables secure!!,8,3 January 2017,"Idris Elba is a convincing action hero and suits this type of action role - realistic enough not too old serious enough but also with a sense of humor. Denzel has been looking tired and puffy, the Rock is too big to be realistic. He also has a good rapport with his costar Richard Madden of Game of Thrones. Richard looked not prince like enough for Cinderella but here he makes a likable enough rogue - a pickpocket who turns out to have a useful set of skills. If like me and many others you have been the subject of some theft in a European city you would know how successful these scum bag pickpockets can be. It's quite eye opening to see it in action on screen. Two good British actors playing Americans. Idris is a CIA agent after a pickpocket who inadvertently picks up a bomb.The timing of the movie with the constant terror in France and it's unfortunate original title Bastille Day may have caused some not to see this movie - but that would be a shame - it's one of the more entertaining action movies of recent years with novel action sequences and a solid story that comes together and doesn't have too many irritating twists and turns.",The Take
10,gradyharp,'I can't believe that cop shot at me!' 'You're a terrorist subject who killed four people - what did you expect?',9,27 November 2016,"Paris under siege. Were it not for recent events of terrorism in the City of Light this film would have less impact, but the manner in which writers Andrew Baldwin and writer/director James Watkins approach the concept of the milieu of terrorism and present their heist story shows just how much the alert for further terrorist acts exists. Gunshots? Must be terrorists! And whether or not the intent of the film is to soften the global fear of non-terrorist Muslims, the end result is a reminder of the fact that terrorism and Islam are NOT inextricably bound!As the film opens we watch a likable pickpocket from the US trying to make enough money to return home and become a physician – name Michael Mason (Richard Madden in a fine turn of a role). He becomes inadvertently involved in a crime scene when he picks up a bag discarded by on Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) who has tossed the bad and her mission for the criminals to escape involvement in a bomb threat. The bag contains a teddy bear. Not realizing the toy contains a timed bomb, he tosses it aside on a busy street. A few seconds later it explodes, killing four people. CCTV footage reveals Mason's face and the French police tag him as a 'terrorist threat'. The explosion, although botched, was set up by a select group of the French Interior Ministry as a decoy so they can make a half billion dollar digital transfer from a bank, closed on Bastille Day. In a separate CIA investigation the unruly agent Sean Briar (Idris Elba – in fine form), discovers the real story behind Masons ""terrorist attack"". The two men, on different sides of the law, collaborate to bring the corrupt members of the Ministry down. In the process far too many people are killed, including Sean Briar's boss (Kelly Reilly) and slowly but surely the evil is unveiled – corruption that goes to the top.The cinematography (the film was shot in Paris with an emphasis on the Île-de-France) by Tim Maurice-Jones captures the tension well and the musical score by Alex Heffes adds to the mood of the film. Special credit goes to Film Editor Jon Harris who makes the rooftop runs and leaps by Elba and Madden feel real! A very fine supporting cast makes this film meaningful on many levels, not the least of which being compassion for Muslims who have nothing to do with terrorism!",The Take
11,bowmanblue,Take it or leave it,6,20 February 2017,"I was trying to work in a 'Taken' pun somewhere, but, try as I might, 'The Take' isn't that much like Liam Neeson's 'Taken' saga to warrant its inclusion. If you want to know what 'The Take' is like then I'd describe it as one of those – oh-what-do-you-call-them – type films. In other words, those films that fall into that middle-of-the-road category that you watch because you kind of like them, but probably won't remember them in X amount of days.The only thing that makes it less forgettable than the rest is the ever-reliable Idris Elba who plays a CIA agent based in a European city (which I think was Paris, however it's been over a week since I watched the film, so details are already a little bit sketchy!). Anyway, a young thief (played by Richard Madden who was best-known for his 'Rob Stark' in 'Game of Thrones') accidentally steals a handbag containing a terrorist's bomb (see, kids? Crime doesn't pay!). So, when it goes off, all the authorities think it's him. Luckily Mr Elba can see the thief through the smoke and picks him up first, allowing the pair of them a little time to clear the thief's name, bring the real culprits to justice and also stop another attack on the capital. All in a day's work for Idris.So, expect the shoot-outs, expect the car chases and expect a reasonable amount of banter between the straight-laced Idris and the anti-hero Madden. I know I'm being a little flippant when I'm describing it, but it's a decent enough affair. It has everything you'll want from a thriller, with the possible exception of originality. It's nothing you haven't seen before (sometimes better, sometimes worse). The two leads play off each other well enough to at least make this worth a watch. How many times you'll want to watch it afterwards may be another matter.If you're a fan of either of the two main leads, or just can't get enough of those films that – sort of – feel a bit like the 'Bourne' franchise (i.e. chases across European cities pursued by rogue agents) then you may get more than most out of this flick. Otherwise, it's basically one of those 'rent-before-you-buy' type films. If it's on Netflix or Amazon Instant video – it should fill a gap in your viewing schedule.",The Take
12,ThomasDrufke,James Bond Warm-Up,7,19 May 2019,"'The Take' feels like it has all the major trademarks of the 'Action-crime-drama', which is why it takes a good cast & crew to separate itself from cliches and predictability. The concept is great: an unlikely team-up, a pickpocket gets caught up in a terrorist plot and is forced to join up with a CIA agent. Pair Richard Madden and Idris Elba as the two characters and you have two people that can elevate pretty much anything they're in. The first half does a nice job of subverting your expectations, something the second & third act seem to forget about accomplishing. The reason for that being that the scope of the film continues to increase with each scene, thus losing the thrill of having this being a smaller-scale crime-thriller. At first it feels like the 2016 film 'Focus', then a little more like 'The Purge' franchise, perhaps throw in a little 'Fast & Furious', and you have 'The Take'. A good film in its own right, though, all I could think about was how much I would still love to see Elba & Madden play James Bond one day.7.1/10",The Take
13,A_Different_Drummer,Better than Bourne!,8,17 August 2016,"I am not speaking frivolously when I say that overall, although produced with a fraction of the budget, this is a much better film than the fourth Bourne.Specifically: * great opener -- film opens with a dramatic situation that immediately grabs the viewers' attention. You have ""connection"" from the getgo.* great script --- many layers and twists. Clever dialog. (At one point the bad guys gloat about how they are manipulating ""the hashtags"" -- thereby dissing an entire generation. Another line of dialog refers to the use of ""action and reaction"" to achieve their end -- which is a very sophisticated dig at how politics are managed today.) * Director writer Watkins know to keep things interesting, you are never bored.* Elba is nothing short of awesome. Other reviewers are saying he could be a major international action figure. Agree! Solid entertainment, does not take the viewer for granted, and the clever story keeps you hooked.",The Take
14,cosmo_tiger,A movie that could have been generic but enough aspects just clicked and the movie became tense and exciting.,7,4 February 2017,"""This is crazy. I don't work for the CIA."" Michael Mason (Madden) is an expert pick pocket that is working the streets of France. While sitting down counting his loot he notices a woman throw a large bag away. He walks to it and looks for cash. As he walks away the bag explodes and he is picked up as the only suspect for the bombing. Now Michael must work with the anti-terrorist force to try and figure out what happened and what will happen next. This is a very exciting, tense and entertaining movie. It keeps you guessing and really sets the tone right off with Michael being brought in. You are never really able to settle in and trust anyone. That detail adds something to the movie that is needed and helps you become more involved. Elba and Madden are great in their roles and their acting along with the little details it throws in really transforms this movie from just another ""let's stop terrorism"" movie into something that seems fresh. Overall, a movie that could have been generic but enough aspects just clicked and the movie became tense and exciting. I give this a high B.",The Take
15,Reno-Rangan,One wrong move made a small time thief a target.,6,24 October 2016,"The first thing is this film came at the worst time in the history of France. If it was set in elsewhere in the world would have had less issue, but the Paris terror attack and this theme had lots of similarity. I mean it was nothing to do with the incident, but the contents are very impactful. Which also might be the reason for the film not doing well. I did not enjoy much this film, for me it was the story that turned me off. It was sympathetic to terrorists in the first half, so I completely hated that part, and then the last 30 or so minutes it got better. I mean not awesome or like that, but just good.Directed by 'Eden Lake' famed director. Another very familiar story, but altered like it was for the first time in a film. So most of the parts are predictable, but one twist during the beginning of the third act made it look good. Amazing pace, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger going forward. But as we know, those developments were so clichéd. All the actors were okay, and it has some decent stunts as well. I think it is a good timepass film and nothing else..6/10",The Take
16,paulclaassen,"Good enough action thriller, with a twist...",6,24 December 2018,"Richard Madden plays a pickpocket who gets involved over his head when he steals the wrong packet. This is a great premise for an action thriller, but unfortunately Richard Madden doesn't pull it off as I had hoped. His acting is far too comical compared to Idris Elba's tough-as-nails persona, and the two characters doesn't gel that well together (for me, at least).The film has some great action sequences and very good visuals. It gets more interesting as the film progresses, as we learn there's much more here than meets the eye. The entire film is about a brilliant (inside) plan to rob a bank. This twist was completely unexpected, so the film definitely deserves more than one viewing to follow the leads.In the vein of 2005's 'Chaos' starring Jason Statham, this is an interesting heist/bank robbery action thriller.",The Take
17,cruise01,A fast pace action filled with chases and fighting with no sense of plot and direction,6,8 February 2017,"The Take also known as Bastille Day is a cheap action film that showcases Idris Elba as the next action star in a movie with a decent direction and performances. This film had the potential of being better if they improved with the script, direction, and even having a thicker plot. The plot follows a pickpocketing Michael (Richard Madden), who steals from others on the streets of Paris. With his skill of distracting people and being unnoticed and skilled as a thief. He steals from a young lady Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) handbag and walks away unnoticed. Only to be disappointed with a phone and a small teddy bear. He leaves the bag behind a trashcan. And the bag explodes creating chaos on the streets of Paris. CIA operative Sean (Idris Elba) is on the hunt for Michael before the Paris officials can take him in. With Michael on the run from the CIA and the police. He will need the help from Sean to clear out his name by finding Zoe and escaping from a group of bad guys that want to cause chaos. It is a decent action film that I thought it was better than expected. Idris Elba and Richard Madden teaming up as they try to put the pieces together of the bad guys motivation. The chemistry with the characters like Idris playing a guy that has secrets and is good at what he does with his job. Richard playing a lying thief, and gives a lie about what he wants to do with his life. Then, there is Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) who is caught up with being forced to set the bomb in place but fails too because she does not want to hurt people. The film has plenty of chases and action sequences to make up for a disappointing plot. Idris Elba, Richard Madden, and Charlotte Le Bon are talented actors but being given with a decent script to work with. I also found the plot to be quite disappointing with using the idea of terrorism. A group of guys that want to place fear into the city by causing chaos and anarchy. Lets throw in a few corruptions with the law enforcement. As the movie progresses, the plot become less and less interesting as there motivations are revealed. With this type of movie on a short run time of an hour and thirty minutes. Its one of those things that you can watch if you really have nothing to see or pick it up as a rental. The movie could have been so much more with a smart direction, and better script.",The Take
18,leonblackwood,Intense drama/action throughout! 6/10,6,21 October 2016,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, because it's full of action and suspense throughout, and the two main characters, Sean Briar (Idris Elba) and Michael Mason (Richard Madden), worked well together. The movie is based in Paris, on the eve of Bastille Day, we're a bomb explodes and kills 4 people. CIA agent, Briar is sent on the case to find the culprit who is responsible for the explosion, and after searching through CCTV footage, he see's Mason's face, who is a known pick pocket. After hunting him down, Mason tells Briar that he stole the suitcase, not knowing that there was a bomb in it, and there life's soon become in danger because the true terrorist have tracked the phone that Mason stole from the suitcase. With Briar and Mason running for there life's, they try and hunt down the person who was originally carrying the suitcase but she is in hiding because she knows that the terrorist want to kill her, because she didn't go ahead with placing the bomb in a busy bank. I don't want to go into too much depth about the movie because it will spoil it for people who haven't watched it. Idris Elba played the moody CIA Agent quite well, and I was surprised to see that he could actually fight. Richard Madden also played the pick pocket quite well, and the two opposites was a great mixture for this action thriller. I don't know why they had to use American accents, because it didn't really matter were they came from, and I didn't understand why Briar was sent out to do everything by himself, especially as the CIA knew that the public was at risk. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, if you are into action/thriller movies, and I wouldn't be surprised if Elba was tipped to be the next Bond. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although this movie didn't blow up at the box office, I haven't heard a bad word said about it. With Richard Madden, 30, straight off the Game Of A Thrones set, as Robb Stark, he has proved that he has some more tools in the box but I don't know if he can carry a movie by himself. Anyway, this film was written and directed by James Watkins, who also brought you Eden Lake and The Woman in Black. He hasn't had that much experience when it comes to action movies but for his 3 project, he didn't do too bad. I was impressed with the rooftop and riot scenes, which were put together well, so I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, if he gets a massive budget.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $9millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/dramas, starring Idris Elba, Richard Madden, Kelly Reilly, Charlotte Le Bon, Anatol Yusef, Jose Garcia and Stephane Caillard. 6/10",The Take
19,TheMovieDiorama,The Take boasts a stellar cast but falters with a generic predictable plot.,5,29 May 2018,"Originally titled 'Bastille Day', however due to a recent attack at the time of its release it was apt to rename this crime thriller. Regardless, changing the title cannot amend the noticeable flaws that hinder what could've been an exciting thrill ride. A thief, gifted with sleight of hand talents, steals a bag which happens to contain a bomb. Now on the run from governmental agencies, he teams up with an American agent to stop the real perpetrators. There is a political message hiding beneath the action, revolutionising against fascism. Riots spawn, security increase and Idris Elba running across rooftops as he protects the Parisian streets from terrorism. I think we can all learn from him in one way or another. But yes, revolutionary message aside this is simply just generic and unfortunately rather forgettable. Elba is a leading actor, we've seen his capabilities before and to some extent he is the main appeal here. The hand-to-hand choreography is well executed, although haphazardly edited occasionally, and does enhance the action required to elevate the story. Madden on the other hand is a beautiful creature, but that's not enough to redeem the monotony in his acting. Le Bon and Reilly were criminally underused, particularly the latter. The plot is easy enough to follow for the average viewer however doesn't exactly provide many thrills for those who have watched similar films before. And that's the main issue, its genericism doesn't differentiate itself above the rest making it quickly forgettable. One twist was well executed however the rest of the plot was predictable. On the flip side, it's a well structured narrative that makes its ninety minute runtime fly by. Even if the first and second acts are uninspired cat and mouse chases. Overall, The Take simply just takes up your time giving you limited thrills. Clean direction, serviceable acting and well executed action can't save a dull predictable plot. Oh, and stay for the credits song, our boy Elba is also musically talented!",The Take
20,paul-allaer,"Zany action movie about ""a pick-pocket and a drug mule"" suffers from bad timing",7,22 November 2016,"""The Take"" (2016 release from France; 92 min.; original title ""Bastille Day"") brings the story of a CIA operative in Paris, who is called in to look into a suspicious bombing that may have a US element to it. As the movie opens, we are at ""Sacre Coeur, Paris"" and we see a pick-pocket at work. It turns out to be a American guy names Michael. As rotten luck would have it, at some point Michael steals a bag from a French woman, not knowing that the bag contains an explosive device. Michael nonchalantly tosses the bag, which explodes, killing four innocent people. Michael flees of course, but his picture was taken by a security camera, and its' not long before the link to the CIA operative is made. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot, will spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is nothing short of a zany, over the top, and fast paced action movie, with ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys. Idris Elba plays the CIA operative Sean Briar, and he is nothing short of a one-man army, literally! There are some terrific action scenes, the best being a long chase on foot on top of the roofs of Paris buildings, and later on a long chase by an out-of-control police van. I have to say, I laughed out loud a number of times, it was simply so over the top ""bad"" that it became ""almost good"", if you know what I mean. If you don't take all of this too seriously, it's a fun movie. Alas, in reality, this movie has been cursed as to its timing , its release having been delayed a number of times due to real events happening in Paris and France that were uncomfortably close to what is being depicted in the movie (in France, the movie was released just days before the Nice attacks last summer, and hence promptly withdrawn from the theaters). The movie was subsequently renamed from ""Bastille Day"" to ""The Take"", not that it will change much as to the movie's commercial success (or lack thereof).""The Take"" recently opened on one screen for the entire SW Florida region. The Monday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only one other person besides myself). I couldn't help but notice how much I laughed throughout the movie, and simply went with the flow. Yes, there are plot holes the size of Manhattan, but that is besides the point. It's an unabashed action movie and on that level it delivers. If you enjoyed, say, the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise, or an even more apt comparison, some of Dwayne Johnson's action movies, ""The Take"" is a European equivalent to that, and is likely right up your alley.",The Take
21,alindsay-al,An above average action film,6,26 April 2016,"I was excited for this film because I really like idris Elba and in the end this film is alright. The premise of the film sees a cia agent and a master pick pocket have to team up to try and stop a terrorist plot in Paris. Idris elba plays the main protagonist and he is really good in the film, he is grizzly and tough but he also has a sense of humour to him. I do believe this was a pretty good james bond audition tape for him. Richard madden plays the pick pocket and I really liked him too, his chemistry with elba is really good and there funny banter works. His smaller physique also allowed for the contrast to work. However, everybody else in the film was a waste, especially the villains who had absolutely no character or personality to them and were there just to be bad guys. The story has some nice social commentary to it which I had very little idea about and some of the twists were interesting. But you have seen it all before I promise you, seen an action movie then the plot of this film comes across as paper thin. The script has some fun witty banter in it between characters but it lacks in it's dramatic impact. It also is very cliché just like its plot. The style is a mixed bag, for every great shootout or chase scene there's a shaky cam close quarters fight. I liked some of the action in this film but some of it just came across as flat. Overall I think this is a decent movie that if you like action films you should see.",The Take
22,3xHCCH,Imposing and Exciting Idris Elba,8,22 April 2016,"Idris Elba has been in big Marvel films like ""Thor"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", but I don't really know how he looked like without the Heimdall costume. He had a performance last year in the film ""Beasts of No Nation"" which triggered controversy when he was not nominated for an Oscar, but this was not shown locally. Just this year, he had been in two films, ""Zootopia"" and ""The Jungle Book."" However in both films, we only hear his deep imposing voice. With this film ""Bastille Day,"" we finally see Idris Elba as a modern day action hero, not far from the news that he is being touted to be the next James Bond. Michael Mason is a skillful American thief in Paris. One day, he steals a bag from a distraught girl on the street named Zoe. After getting her cell phone and seeing nothing else of apparent value in the bag, he throws it into a garbage dump. The unexpected happens, killing four people and triggering mass paranoia and discontent in the city of Lights. CIA operative Sean Briar goes over and beyond his assignment to get to Mason and secure him before the French Police do, uncovering an insidiously complex plot which will come to pass on Bastille Day. Idris Elba is as imposing and impressive as his voice was. When asked why he ran away, Mason quipped, ""Don't you see how you look like?"" Elba's Briar was big, macho, tough and scary, anyone would have tried to run if he comes to get him. As an agent, Briar was an independent-minded and reckless rouge to the chagrin of his CIA bosses, but to the delight of the audience. If this was a preview of how he would be as James Bond, it makes us all eager to see how Elba will transform the iconic role as his own.Richard Madden is more known to many as the ill-fated Robb Stark on HBO's ""Game of Thrones"". After he bid the TV series goodbye via a bloody Red Wedding, he went on to be Prince Charming in the live action version of ""Cinderella."" Physically, Madden looked like a scared boy when placed side by side with the intimidating Idris Elba, which made him just right for the role of the unfortunate Mason, a guy who just so happened to steal the wrong bag. I liked the chemistry that was built between the two characters.I was floored by the action sequences of this film, so raw with bone- crunching realism. I liked that the chase and fight scenes were not too obviously choreographed. That chase scene on the rooftops would have been flawless parkour stunts in another film. But here it was shaky and so uncertain that it created so much tension, so much better. The execution of the many twists and turns of the story was very effectively done, such that we never would have seen the climax miles away. I would not mind a sequel as the ending seemed to suggest. 8/10.",The Take
23,TdSmth5,Good false-flag themed action thriller,8,11 September 2016,"A naked girl walks in public somewhere in Paris. It causes a sensation. Some pickpocket named Michael takes advantage of the situation and has a field day. Turns out he hired her to distract people.Terrorists convince a girl named Zoe to place a bomb in an empty building at night. But when she arrives the cleaning crew is there so she changes her mind. She calls her handler in distress. Michael sees all this and at the right moment steels her bag that has her cellphone, a teddy bear with the bomb, and a blonde wig. He takes the phone and throws away the bag somewhere. Seconds later the bomb is detonated and people die.Quickly the police find video footage and think Michael is the perpetrator. The CIA has some office in Paris and they quickly identify him by name and discover he's an American and send their best man after him. That would be Sean. We've met him before. He's of course some cool cowboy loose cannon who when called to his superior ends up insulting him.When Michael sees his face all over the news he decides to get his cash and run just around the time when Sean arrives at his place. A chase on Parisian rooftoops ensues and Sean grabs Michael and interrogates him. By now the terrorists, who had a tracking device in Zoe's phone, also catch up with these two. While they fight with Sean, Michael escapes. When the terrorists are about to grab him Sean arrives in time. Now these two have to join forces of sorts to find Zoe. This they do and then all three have to fight the bad guys.All this is happening before Bastille Day and the attacks are blamed on Muslims. The special police unit takes a very heavy hand against protesters and Muslims. Some character is using social media to provoke protests. We learn of corruption inside the police department and the French government. The bomb turned out to be a false flag.Bastille Day starts out as a very strong action thriller. There are some very exciting moments. It shows some great sights of Paris not usually seen. But it can't maintain that excitement unfortunately. The direction especially when it comes to action shows some weaknesses. And then there's the casting of Idris Elba as the uncharismatic action lead, a role not particularly suited for him. The character of Michael is just some scared kid in way over his head. He doesn't get to contribute a whole lot the movie, even though his character for sure had more potential than the lead. Kelly Reilly delivers as a well-connected CIA operative.I'm going to give Bastille Day a higher score nevertheless because finally some filmmakers had the guts to make a movie about a false flag operation, a topic that should provide material for plenty of action/thriller/dramas. Granted that with the motivation for it all they took the easy route, it's still a gutsy script at a time when the the spineless entertainment industry continues to act as the propaganda ministry for the corrupt establishment.",The Take
24,s3276169,"Watchable ""by the numbers"" espionage thriller",7,23 August 2016,"Bastille Day is a ""by the numbers"" espionage thriller. That's not to say this is a poor film. What it does, it does well. There's a good cast including the talented Idris Elba in the role of a CIA operative. Great Parisian sets, locations and lots of predictable but still enjoyable, action sequences.Where it falls down somewhat is in the storytelling and character development, department. The storyline is a bit ""thin"", stretching credulity to its limit whilst not doing anything that, in one form or other, has not been done before. Equally, its s shame the character development was not better. Actors like Elba and the cast are not really given the opportunity to really ""show off"" their craft, with rather flat, action caricatures being the order of business instead.Putting these considerations aside, there's still more to like here than not. This film punches one ticket that all good films in this genre should, its has loads of mostly exciting action, that keep the film rolling along. Seven out of ten from me.",The Take
25,questl-18592,Taking Bastille,6,27 February 2021,"How do I manage to stumble on two supremely generic movies back to back? Killing Them Softly followed by this? Ugh. So, Bastille Day (aka The Take) follows Elba's tough guy agent as he teams up with a super cocky pickpocket played by Madden. It's just such an obvious attempt to do like a buddy flick in the James Bond realm and it never works. Madden's character brings nothing to this and his performance feels so flat all the way through. Elba elevates things just because the man exudes gravitas and I now kinda wanna see him just list off the ingredients of things because that would be the most captivating thing on youtube that day.There's no reason to watch this beyond Elba though. If you're looking for more of his awesomeness and you've seen everything else? Go for it. Otherwise, this one is probably something to pass by.",The Take
26,Amari-Sali,"It lacks compelling characters, ultimately disappoints with its story, but helps you can see why people think Idris Elba should be the next James Bond.",7,28 August 2016,"Trigger Warning(s): Bomb In Public Place | Hanging BodyCharacters Worth NotingSean Briar (Idris Elba) | Michael Mason (Richard Madden)Main Storyline With the CIA having active surveillance in France, naturally when an American citizen is accused of being a terrorist they try to nab him before the French. Thing is, this would be American terrorist is simply a very adept pickpocket named Michael who stole from the wrong person. Thus leading him to be the fall guy for a group which, at first, seems to be about fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. Though Agent Briar's investigation reveals it isn't something as interesting as that.{Commentary}The idea of people manipulating anti-immigrant sentiment, especially in a country like France where the immigration of Muslims is a hot button issue, I found to be quite interesting and provocative. For whether the goal would be anti-immigrant legislation, a war, be it foreign or civil, or just plain chaos, being that natives were the catalyst it seemed like one hell of a plot. Well, sadly my optimism was dashed quickly and swiftly as we learned everything was simply about creating an opportunity to steal money. My disappointments didn't end there, though. Like many others, part of the reason for seeing this film, besides Elba being a decent action hero, was to see what Richard Madden was like outside of Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, be it my own mental type casting, or Madden just not charismatic to break out from the role yet, what you get is an adept pickpocket who seems without much in the way of personality. However, I won't fully blame Madden for honestly, from Elba to Madden, damn near every character is shallow and forgettable.Which isn't to say we aren't told things about them. The problem is, everything we are told is but a quick snippet told by a 3rd party. A method of story telling which strips whatever nuance the character could give their own life, and with no one really seems to want to open up and be vulnerable toward one another, for after all there are bombings and riots on the streets, it turns the film into a generic action movie. For, to me anyway, the only time it felt like people were excited and into what was happening, was when bullets and fists were flying.Review Summary HighlightsThe action of the movie definitely helped push the idea Elba could handle becoming James Bond if both parties would pursue such an idea.Low PointsThe characters are thinly written and the movie is more about the action than anything else. There are multiple roads avoided which could make motives more complex, the characters more complex, and definitely more vibrant, but it seems the easy way is often chosen. Thus leaving us with a borderline mindless action movie.",The Take
27,richard-1787,Just action/adventure,3,1 July 2017,"There isn't much of anything to this movie, other than a lot of fast action, with the usual ""collateral damage."" Idris Elba is an actual actor, but he has no material to act with here. So, for that matter, is Thierry Godard, one of the leads in the French TV series Un Village français, but here he gets nothing at all.Every now and then there are allusions to current politics in French - the National Front, etc. - but they don't go anywhere, and are not explained.Not much is done with the Paris setting. No pleasant scenes in the Eiffel Tower restaurants, or along the banks of the Seine, etc.There is no point in summarizing the plot, such as it is, because it's not very interesting. Suffice it to say that, when all is said and done, this is actually about an impossible bank holdup.If you decide to watch this movie - and I can't imagine why you would - watch it late at night when your mind has shut down and doesn't catch all the holes in the plot.",The Take
28,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Take,7,12 December 2016,"Intricate, complicated, and abidingly violent, The Take (my latest review) is akin to the best Jason Bourne movie you never saw. I didn't mind that its ending felt like all things direct-to-video. I also didn't mind that two of its villains (a bad cop and the Paris head of Homeland Security) looked enough alike to make the proceedings a little distracting. No I dug ""Take"" and you might too. It's got a new breed of action hero in Idris Elba. He's smoldering, a total badass, and he sends this thrumming action thriller into veritable orbit. Butt kicker Jason Statham would be proud. Paul Greengrass would be content and totally enamored. Bruce Willis would trade in all his Die Hard talons just to get back in this game.Anyway, The Take whose original title is Bastille Day (a reference to France's version of Independence Day in the U.S.), is about the unlikely partnership between an insubordinate CIA agent (Sean Briar played by Elba) and a runaway thief (Michael Mason played by Richard Madden). They join forces to eliminate a terrorist conspiracy in the City of Lights. Idris Elba is intimidating and confident, with a devil-may-care attitude as the seething Briar. Madden looks like a cross between Hugh Jackman and Justin Timberlake with an acting voice similar to Jackman's overwrought American accent. Their characters have good chemistry together even if it is at times, a little corny.Not withstanding a low expectation module, ""Take"" was a pleasant surprise for me. It's a shame that most people never got a chance to see it (the film was pulled from theaters in Europe based on actual terrorist activity there). This 92-minute flick is faithfully helmed by writer/director James Watkins (The Woman in Black, Eden Lake). Watkins provides The Take with leveling technobabble, panning aerial shots, and plenty of malevolent fistfights. He uses Paris as a separate star locale, swiftly bringing you into a reconnaissance world of pickpockets, government corruption, and not so innocent bystanders (being framed for murderous acts). Oh and in ""Take"", he showcases the best on-foot movie chase since 2006's Casino Royale.As per the plot points in The Take, well they mesh together splendidly like warm apple cider and donuts. The look by cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones is standard by way of most spy thrillers but is equally modern and palatable. And there is less jittery camera-work in ""Take"" than in the Bourne movies. In truth, that's okay by me. Bottom line: See The Take. As a rental, it's a decent ""keepsake"". Rating: 3 stars.",The Take

31,quincytheodore,"Bastille Day suffices as a decent thriller with capable actors, but the sleight of hand can't carry its more complex and demanding subplots.",7,25 June 2016,"There's an opinion that Idris Elba would make a good James Bond, and although this is different in context, Bastille Day might just be the closest thing. It's a thriller based on espionage set on beautiful city of Paris, offering a few layers of subplots which unfortunately not equal in effectiveness. It does succeeds in a simpler scale where the actors are given more spotlight either it's from action or occasional comedy.Story mainly follows Michael (Richard Madden), a pickpocket who unluckily stumbles upon a package of bomb meant for terrorist attack. He's then chased by various parties for a crime much worse than he actually committed. Among them is Briar (Idris Elba) who eventually uncovers something amiss which leads him into a much bigger conspiracy.The main duo has more chemistry than expected. Michael is a skilled pickpocket, although he's younger and seemingly more gullible when faced with more extreme threat. Briar takes the mantle of senior officer with shady track record who has a tendency of going rogue based on his instinct alone. One of the correct things the movie does right is showcasing them in their fields, not in all out brawl.It also gives a few comedic moments that surprisingly presentable, the addition of Charlotte Le Bon as Zoe, the unintentional accomplice, rounds up the ragtag crew. At latter end, this eclectic party is a good choice for protagonist perspective. However, it often delivers the plot in rather complicated route, shifting between one set piece to another without smooth transition.There are moments where the characters run or drive around in the city sporadically. If it's to push the plot, then the scene could've been incorporated with better flow. The movie soon treads on terrorism subplot, but it clearly doesn't have the large production to pull off such city wide mayhem. Aside from a few gorgeous use of choreography, the movie mainly plays out in typical apartments or hideouts.The better parts come from small scale fights and chases. These are better choreographed, it presents more tactical approach, especially in subtle motions that the visual cleverly tell. The action could have less cuts, but it's produced with focus as audience could follow the motion easily.Ambitious in its deception, the espionage / buddy cop gig works better in modest scope.",The Take
32,antoniotierno,good entertainment,7,29 July 2016,"Bastille Day is a vehicle showing off Idris Elba's action hero skills and it succeeds in that respect, menacing with a suave meanness, kicking asses and taking no prisoners but all with charm. He commits to the action hero role with a screen presence that carries the film, even as the script goes down every clichéd path B-grade action movie. The Paris we see is not the City of Lights but a place where the lead actor drives his way through gritty Parisienne outskirts, avoiding bad guys, all the way drawing the viewer's eye away from the secondary actors who never get a chance to flesh out their characters. All in all a nice story with an original location.",The Take
33,bob-the-movie-man,'B' for 'Bastille'; 'B' for 'B-movie',3,1 May 2016,"Idris Elba plays ""reckless and irresponsible"" American CIA operative Sean Briar who is one step ahead of the French police in getting to the bottom of a fatal terrorist bombing in Paris. The apparent bomber is n'er do well pickpocket Michael Mason (Richard Madden, ""Game of Thrones"", ""Cinderella"") who gets more than he bargains for when he snatches the wrong bag from bomb-mule Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon, ""The Hundred Foot Journey""). Teaming up as an unlikely duo, the two chase around (mostly drab) Paris locations to uncover the plot, pursued by well-connected 'terrorists', led by Rafi Bertrand (Thierry Godard), who actually have a much greedier ulterior motive.There is really very little going for this film. The film is an uneasy mish-mash of the plots from Die Hard and (perm-any-one-of-five) recent Liam Neeson movies, laced with elements of Bourne. It all never quite gels into a satisfactory whole.Not wishing to be controversial, but given Idris Elba's undoubted star quality he should only really need to play to his potential to get a well-deserved Oscar nomination this year. Unfortunately, this is not the film that delivers him the material to show that, and he spends most of the film saying little (in a strangely Hackney-fied US accent) and looking broodingly 'reckless and irresponsible'. Richard Madden fares little better, trying to wield some well-worn buddy-cop comedy lines that are neither convincing nor particularly funny. Rafi Bertrand (Thierry Godard) ends up looking like an uglier version of Ricky Gervais (I expect a retweet of this review from #rickygervais for that!) which is a bit difficult to get past to take his character seriously.Giving a much better performance is the very attractive Charlotte Le Bon, who is by far the best thing in the film.Clearly not the film-makers fault, but the movie (with a delayed release for obvious reasons) is a little too close to real-life comfort given the Paris bombings of November 2015: I suspect that as a result the bombing scene was probably edited down somewhat from its original cut in the interests of taste, which is no bad thing as it is an effective sequence for both the visuals and the sound mixing. The uneasy 'West vs Islam' undertone throughout the film's story makes for queasy and unsettling viewing though.Where the film clunks to the floor is in the paint-by-numbers storyline and dialogue. The fact that the film stoops to an exploitative opening shot of a naked accomplice (a barely - no pun intended - credited Stéphane Caillard) is a sign of what's to come. Some of the scenes (particularly one with CIA boss Karen Dacre (Kelly Reilly, ""Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows"")) are utterly predictable and others (like a sniper attempt to shoot Mason) so jaw-droopingly inept as to quash any sense of tension. The finale, featuring a Bastille Day storming of the fascist banking citadel single-handedly by Zoe, like some modern day Marianne, is pretty ludicrous.The special effects budget is funded by the same banker as ""London has Fallen"" (i.e. inadequately) with some scenes such as the (otherwise exciting) rooftop chase lacking the authenticity of a Bond or a Bourne, and the use of what I thought was an obviously model helicopter at one point.Direction is by James Watkins, a Brit who did the passably chilling ""Woman in Black"". I feel vaguely guilty for rating it the way I do as the whole film smells of people trying really hard with the money they had available. Perhaps with a bigger budget it could have been better.According to the film ""the hashtags will push it over"". In that case, #bastilleday #avoid.",The Take
34,vostf,Badly crafted actioneer with a couple of good things in it,3,29 November 2017,"Bastille Day, as it was originally titled for release, is so badly crafted it never reaches the status of a real action feature film. On the whole it is hardly worth more than direct-to-video stuff.Sure action scenes are well done and some plot twists are nice, but the result is just a rushed up series of action scenes and transition/exposition talk scenes. To me it looks like the director is good at shooting music videos or short clips but is totally at a loss with the idea of creating a real rhythm spanning 90 minutes or so.Idris Elba is underused, as usual in movies, so he is not able to bring much more life to that stubborn reckless character. The rest of the cast is OK, they also have very little to work on.Worst of all is the plot. Although some twists revealing part of it are good, in the end it only succeeds in being both nauseous and stupid. Bastille Day graduates here into the Z movie realm: just don't be fooled by the budget and competent cast, producers wanted a quickie and they got what they deserved with this stinking quickie.",The Take
35,JohnRayPeterson,"Good story, very good action, well worth watching.",7,16 October 2020,"For some reason, I had not seen this movie when it was released but thanks to the recommendation from another movie enthusiast I got caught up. If you enjoyed the series McMafia, co-written then directed by James Watkins, you will like Watkins' work again. The producers managed to get a good cast, an interesting storyline and topped it with lots of action, none gratuitous, kind of like the first two Bourne movies.Early on, the movie wastes little time before plunging you in the action; you get a sense where this may be heading and can't wait to see how it develops. There's a scene that will really have you on the edge, perhaps even gasping and if you suffer from vertigo you will not forget it; I thought at the time that it was a dangerous thing to attempt, either that or the undetectable special effects were perfect. I sure hope they used stunt doubles, because... you'll see.
The Sean Briar character seemed tailor-made for Idris Elba, going by the several performances I've seen from this actor; either it was or Elba made the lead his own. From the first scene when Briar is introduced, you know he will be at odds with the rules, the protocols and what is expected of the almost rogue CIA agent, but you also know he's one to get the job done. Michael Mason is the second main character, played Richard Madden, from Games of Throne fame, and it's a character with a complex background and an even harder mission, if you can call it such, to complete. I would best describe it, without making it a spoiler, as being caught between a rock and a hard place. Some keen script writing, and you solved the problem of conveying Mason's character complexity, as you quickly figure out.Now some may be critical of how plausible the story develops, but it isn't anything we haven't seen some form of before; a little suspension of disbelief never hurt anyone, besides, it was necessary to go where it goes. I wondered about the budget for this production, for a second, then I didn't care anymore, I just enjoyed what I saw. There's comfort in tried and true formula 'good guys are the bad guys, and money, corruption, is the best vilain', which is what you'll get here. The ending begs for a sequel, I thought; I'd like to think this was intentional, but it ties it all up nicely, which I felt was unexpected given the mostly European cast, production and of course the venue I always like, Paris.",The Take

42,ginocox-206-336968,Decent B-movie action film marred by lazy screenplay and incessant camera motion,7,19 August 2016,"""Bastille Day"" is a passable action film, if one does not take the plot too seriously. It is hampered by a weak script chock full of half-baked tropes, contrivances and derivative scenes. With recent talk of casting Idris Elba as James Bond, the temptation is to compare the film to recent films in that franchise and some scenes are evocative of scenes from recent Daniel Craig 007 films. A rooftop chase seems to borrow from similar scenes in ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre."" But where ""Skyfall"" had dirt bikes racing across rooftops and crashing into a bazaar, BD offers only a foot race without the collapsing buildings shown in ""Spectre."" While the scene is fairly decent in its own right, it pales in comparison to the big- budget extensively choreographed 007 scenes. As an action star, Elba holds his own fairly well and compares favorably with recent efforts by Liam Neeson in the Taken films, ""Non-Stop,"" ""Run All Night"" and ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" and with John Travolta, particularly in ""From Paris with Love."" He projects confidence, but not the savoir faire or sangfroid of prior actors in the role of Bond. In several respects, the screenplay seems lazy or contrived. A large bomb is stuffed inside a small teddy bear. There is no practical reason to put the bomb in a teddy bear, but it facilitates a plot development. A meeting that goes smoothly is held in a crowded restaurant, but when the same two people meet again and things go horribly wrong, they meet on an isolated rooftop. The villain plans to split the take from a massive heist equally among fourteen redshirts, or at least the ones who survive, which seems rather magnanimous and egalitarian. The villains have access to phenomenal data resources (which is given a half-baked explanation) and complete and unrestricted access to a large financial institution and its computer system. The McGuffin can be transferred to a thumb drive in twenty seconds and used with impunity to transfer huge amounts of cash. The acting is good throughout. Production values are adequate, although marred by a lot of distracting jiggly-cam shots. Fight choreography is decent with innovative moves involving riot shields. The three female characters with lines are underutilized and two groups of black characters seem thrown in only to provide ethnic diversity. Other than the central bromance, there is no romantic angle. There isn't enough background to Elba's Briar to make the character three-dimensional and what little background is given may not be entirely accurate.",The Take

The sound mixing was also pretty poor and the composition was dull and sapped away at the excitement the the action was meant to create.Elba's American accent was not polished at all... It was almost, lazy in fact, however his performance was above average and the fight sequences were okay to good.In terms of script, how did Elba's character know that the other CIA lady was killed? There was no way of him knowing. Nobody told him and he didn't have any opportunity to find out. It would've been one thing if he were speculating, but, he was 100% sure.

50,HadiAriyan07,Mixed Bag But Descent and Entertaining Action Movie,6,19 October 2019,"Action thriller i good it's not great, it's not perfect. ""Bastille Day"" is the work of good performances and interesting story but very predictable, i mean every twist is very predictable, It's not the worst film in the world, but it is painfully mediocre.
The action scenes is good not alot of long takes and the is not alot of shaky cam but alot of cuts unforchantly. As far as action films go, the raised expectations of the first half of the film arguably heighten the disappointment of the clichéd finale.",The Take
51,SpoilerAlertReviews,Average Actioner,5,23 April 2016,"With the constant debate about Elba running for the next Bond, I can't help but think this film is an application for Brit spy stardom. It's fast paced and the action is good though a little shaky and too rushed in parts. A lot happens in the 90mins Elba does a good stubborn, angry CIA agent that goes renegade, turning Game of Thrones' Rob Stark Aka Richard Madden into his pickpocketing bitch, I mean asset and develops a 48hr Murphy/Nolte relationship. Elba's massive presence is made known hitting hard whilst Madden portrays the meek, accidental terrorist. José Garcia's character French intelligence Victor, looked like he had be stylised by Tony Stark and isn't it ironic he was hypnotised robbing a French bank in Now You See Me? And Sherlock Holmes/Flight star Kelly Reilly just didn't do enough. She shows here talent in her previous films but seemed like a half-hearted performance. It's a shame the script wasn't as clever as the plot which was, for some parts, unpredictable; even though far fetched. The plot twists from a terrorist crisis into an elaborate bank heist. It's loaded with unbelievable, clichéd heroics, a French Revolution; hence the film's title and some unnecessary violence that doesn't make sense. Bent cop seeking redemption in the form of millions of dollars (not euros oddly enough) because of losing fellow comrades in action, yet, he'll happily hang one of his own men. It's spirals rapidly out of control as does Elba's character. There's some clever touches to the action and it's a good effort, I was entertained but nothing ground breaking.

54,rutzelb,As good as a Jason Bourne Movie,9,9 February 2017,"Pick-pocket Michael Mason (Richard Madden) picks up a toy bear in a bag next to a sitting girl not knowing there is a bomb inside it and tosses it. It explodes killing 4-peoole. The gov't see his picture and tags him as a terrorist. This was supposed to be a diversion by bad guys to get almost a billion dollars in bit coins from the French National Bank. CIA agent Sean Briar (Idris Elba) discovers the real story and teams up with Mason to clear his name.This is as good as a Jason Bourne movie. There is a good chase scene in the beginning when Mason runs from Briar across tin roofs and they can be slippery. Hey, I had to hold on tightly to keep from slipping off the couch. Briar asks Mason why he was running if he is so innocent. Mason says, ""You were coming at me. Did you see yourself?"" Mason almost convinces Briar that he is truly innocent and is not a terrorist and Briar needs him to track down the girl with the bag to get to the rest of the gang. Mason says he never thought he would be working for the CIA and Briar says, "" Well you are now."" The banter between Mason and Briar is very good and more good lines can be heard. There are many twists and turns and some will surprise you or maybe not. Hey, I did get one right. (You were lucky this time) The rest of the movie has Mason, Briar and now Zoe (Charlotte Le Bron) - the girl with the bag - on the run from the bad guys. We do see a good vehicle chase scene. There is good suspense all around the tension really shows up at the shoot-out in the French bank. Over all this is a very good thriller and Idris Elba does a good job as a new action hero. Notables: Kelly Riley as Karen, Briar's CIA boss; Jose Garcia as Victor, French Intelligence Chief; and Thierry Godard as Rafi, the chief bad guy.We have a new super-hero running around now.

62,muons,A Cheesy Action Movie,4,29 June 2018,"A charming pickpocket, a CIA agent with unorthodox practices and a bunch of villains who can mysteriously infiltrate swat teams pretty much tell what the movie is all about. The one dimensional, dispassionate, taciturn antihero character initially looked funny with Arny starring in Terminator movies and alike. However, when others (Van Damme, Rock, etc.) started to mimic the same wooden acting style, they looked and became outright boring. In this cheesy action movie, the ""cool"", disinterested acting of Idris Elba evokes the same bad feelings. The plot is so predictable that the pace of the unfolding events always lags behind your guess. This is an action movie that I fell asleep in the last 20 min. or so. The only good thing about it is some nice Paris scenes in the background.",The Take
63,Alex_Hodgkinson,Exciting Thriller,6,22 April 2016,"I'm torn between a 6 and 7 for this film. This has everything a good thriller should have, but nothing notably unique about the film or the way it's done past the protagonists and some of the cinematography.The film is a spiral into chaos and the characters are very likable, forming an unlikely friendship between a thief and a CIA agent. Idris Elba and Richard Madden show off some great acting that really drives the film, with the dialogue between the two easily being my favourite part of the film. The directing is great, too, with a riveting chase sequence that looks and feels exciting and some lovely cinematography in France.The premise isn't anything amazing, but throwing a sly, witty pocket thief into the mix of what would be an ordinary every-year thriller is what drives the film and makes it anything worth noting. If you're going to see this film for any reason, it should be for the two leads. Bastille Day is nothing unique, but it's definitely a good film if you're in the mood for a thriller (however I'd recommend Eye in the Sky over this). This is a film for people that are into thrillers and fun character interaction.",The Take
64,darthsteele-39338,NO SUBTITLES! EERRGH!,1,19 September 2020,Most of the dialogue is in French but THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES! Not that this cliche plot is very hard to follow but being able to understand the dialogue would be nice.,The Take
65,fxdx4,A solid action thriller with no real political baggage! Enjoy,7,16 September 2016,"This film (unfortunately) is most famous because it was set to come out at the same time as a Islamic terrorist attack in France, and one of the reasons I waited a while to watch this film was because I was wary of how Muslims would be portrayed in it etc. Let me without spoilers tell you this film is almost entirely unpolitical, with the 'Islamic threat' so far down the radar it can't even be said to be a theme.Now on to the film! Do you like Idris Elba? If you don't, stop reading this review and never watch this film. This is his film. He plays a bad-ass CIA agent (there is an irony of a British actor playing a CIA man stationed in France) who does not like to follow rules, and he is on the trail of a master pick pocket (Richard Madden) who gets wrapped up in a plot to blow up France. Cliché, yes, but the film does avoid some obvious ones, surprising pleasantly at some points.Elba is menacing, cool and always fantastic, and all of his co-stars pull their weight, but none are particularly likable, and they just have very little chemistry together. But, this is an action, thriller, so who really cares about that. The action is solid, but not mind blowing. The balance between action and thriller is about right, and the director does not get distracted with too many side characters or plots.This is about as standard a movie as you can get, with the only real plus being Elba. He needs to do more action movies, he needs to be the next Bond. 6.5, but IMDb won't let me give it that score so I bump to a 7 on Elba's performance!",The Take

67,Instant_Palmer,Good Action Flick - Tense & Well-Paced,7,1 March 2021,"Granted, the inside bank heist plot is implausible in 'Bastille Day' (retitled 'The Take' for its USA release), but the director James Watson paces the film so well with non-stop tense moments, and taps Idris Elba's innate tension-building talents and ability to deliver quick dialogue (as he does with Sorkin's trademark banter in 'Molly's Game'), that one overlooks the spectacularly unrealistic story of the intended heist.This is a pure entertainment escapism - an action film that does not pretend to be more than it is.Therefore, I'm giving two thumbs up 👍👍 for a good fun-to-watch action flick. Grab a dish of popcorn and enjoy. Note my 7 Rating means it's good (like an 8 by most User standards).Richard Madden and Jose Garcia are well-casted.Is it just me that thinks Garcia looks and acts a lot like Harvey Kietel in his 30s?!",The Take
68,wtmerrett,Really Bad,1,10 May 2017,I wanted to see this for Idris Alba as he is a very fine actor and I really liked him in Luther. I quickly discovered that the script was the huge letdown in this nag. It is very poorly written and takes liberties that the audience is supposed to ignore of hopefully completely miss. The only other cast member I know is Kelly Reilly who does as good a job as possible given the crappy dialogue. Both Reilly and Alba are British but are asked to play Americans so have to put on American accents to supposedly be CIA agents. I still do not understand why there were Americans in this obvious French bank robbery picture. It served no purpose and they could just as easily have been British SAS or whatever is the latest acronym. Once again a picture getting made when it should not have.,The Take
69,MackMonMay87,"Solid, Underrated Thriller with Elba",7,1 October 2020,"""The Take"" is probably the best endorsement for Idris Elba as James Bond there could be.
Granted that I think more original black characters should be made available to black actors instead of inheriting white roles and properties, but you can really see why Elba has been tossed around, he carries himself with the same grit and confidence Bond, or a Bond-like character would have.The Take has a slick plot involving corrupt cops using fake terror attacks and exploiting mob mentality, outrage, and racial tensions as a way to cover up a massive heist. The idea of other forces manipulating the public based around police brutality is a very relevant idea, and this movie has aged well in that aspect.The cast is strong across the board, with Richard Madden and Charlotte LeBon rounding out the core crew, with all other performers both American, British, and French carrying their roles well.The pace of this movie is tight and clean, very few, if any scenes feel wasted. There aren't any frills or wasted time, everything is urgent, every scene more or less had meaning, and the action, both hand-to-hand (especially on Elba's part) and gun battles are all really well staged, with the shaky cam you see in the first few confrontations getting addressed and worked on later in the movie.The Take isn't perfect and wraps up with a nice bow and has some convenient action movie moments, however it's a very solid action-thriller that for the most part (except a few central to the plot) avoids big explosions and uses smart, technical action at a brisk pace that doesn't feel like 90 minutes. I would definitely recommend this if you're a fan of action in any way.",The Take

71,smithpaulusmc,Cheap and Half-baked,2,12 October 2020,"I very rarely wish to use absolutes or superlative language when judging works of art and entertainment, especially movies. This is because there is generally a silver lining or niche audience that each film seeks to target. However, 2016 spy-thriller wannabe The Take is simply the poorest attempt at recreating James Bond and Jason Bourne I have seen in the last 10 years.The Take stars Idris Elba (an Englishman) as a no-rules American CIA agent who operates with near absolute autonomy. Elba's character, Sean Briar, plays off like an insolent child more than a big-brained hero who knows better than his handlers. And this is no fault of Elba's. I blame lazy, pandering screenwriting that seeks to create a deep, moody character without offering more backstory than a 30-second bit of ""on the nose"" exposition where a coworker literally tells a colleague (and the audience) what Sean Briar is all about.The Take tris to find a modern take on spy thrillers. It incorporates a low-level pickpocket to make things more interesting. Still, the pickpocket's inclusion becomes more of a writer's convenience than a strong plot point. Additionally, The Take rather unrealistically attempts to recreate the effect social media has on protests and civil unrest, utilizing it like a quick side arm that can be fired and forgotten easily.This movie is not worth your time or energy. Nothing about it is genuinely new or exciting. Simply, it incorporates cheap characters to the extent that you will have 2 hours of background noise to fill your home while you scroll through your Facebook and Instagram feed.",The Take

Too much predictable sequences. It's mix of too many movies corrupt police officers and bank robbery with some unnecessary elements to deviate us from the plot. Average movie,The Take
75,modernmonstersdotnet,B-Day,6,23 September 2016,"Yes, it's formulaic, an odd couple of underdogs facing a vast conspiracy, the lonely American saving France. Yes its marketing in this country was severely hampered by the mad truck terrorist attack in Nice on July the 14th, which in ricochet delayed screening in some other countries. It should have been a hit in UK, considering the portrait it paints of contemporary Paris, a city only a few inches above Baghdad in terms of safety, riddled as it is by larceny, fundamentalism, riots and corruption. Oh, and naked women in the streets. Bastille Day nevertheless achieves quite a good deal in the packed, dense, urban thriller genre.The setup goes like follows: a terrorist group intends to plunge Paris into chaos by manipulating traditional and electronic media. Their first strike is to have a mule dropping a bomb at the headquarters of the ""French Nationalist Party"", but the girl gets cold feet when the building is not empty as expected. Her bag with the bomb inside is stolen by a pickpocket (Richard Madden), who discards it in a trash can, killing four people and making him the prime suspect in the process. As the pickpocket is a US citizen, the Paris branch of the CIA tasks free electron Sean Briar (Idriss Elba) to find him before the French Police does, in an increasingly tense situation as the terrorists follow up with their plan, triggering a city-wide state of unrest.Bastille Day's screenplay is not bad, including three twists that can hardly considered as novel but serve a logical progression of the intrigue. The third twist actually resonates in our time and age; it is the third time in a row that street protest is connected to mad finance, as was the case in Money Monster and Jason Bourne, even though in this case the latter is not the cause of the former. The three main characters (including José Garcia as the Head of French Intelligence) are competently written and well acted. But what Bastille Day has that places him a notch above other thrillers in the same vein is the force of nature also known at Idriss Elba.A wrecking ball with a golden heart, Elba bludgeons into the story like the unstoppable force he so convincingly embodies. In a Vertigo-inspired, vertigo-inducing roof top chase as in more intimate scenes in which he conveys credible menace as well as the occasional sparkle of humour, he's impossible to doubt, impossible to resist. He even manages to fool French policemen into thinking he's one of them by piping ""Oui, je arrive"". So cute. He's also very affable to ordinary people he come across during his investigation, most of them African French in suburbs or the Barbès area. The fact that Elba is black himself allows him a connection which cleverly bridges the cultural gap his American origin could entail (he tells the fable he's a refugee from Belize, only to tersely state later on that he was born in Connecticut). But it is his sweetness which gets him through his investigation pitfalls, that and of course and the brute force he's able to summon at will. ""Pinky pumps?"" offers the pickpocket when they close a deal, and Elba's reaction makes that extraordinary desirable, even though you're quite sure he would tear up your little finger without blinking.Yes there are some ""This is Paris, vin rouge, Louis Vuitton"" dialogue, no the prime suspect never shaves his beard even though his picture is on every screen, yes the final confrontation is a bit of a letdown. But for his Anonymous, typically contemporary sacrifice during the National Reserve bravura scene, and some delectable use of the French vernacular (""Abrutis de merde!"" being a personal favourite), Bastille Day is quite good. The lingering question, however, remains why make this kind of fiction in the first place if a brush with crude reality makes you chicken out of its release? How long will politically correct circumnavigate violence, when it had so abrasively eroded race, sex, work and ethics? The answer to that question, if there is one, certainly doesn't lie with Bastille Day, but one is grateful to the movie to ask it, even involuntarily.",The Take
76,Bantam,Rather average action flick,5,24 June 2016,"As far as action movies go, this one is rather average. Even for an Euroflick it's only average, unfortunately. Considering the cast, I would have expected a bit more.Let's see what we have: The story is slightly far fetched, and considering the day and age, a bit 'frumpy'. A SWAT team orchestrates a false-flag bomb plot to distract the city of Paris in order to steal some money. The entire setup goes awry when a pickpocket steals the bomb. Briar, a disgruntled and somewhat grumpy CIA operative (with the obligatory heart of gold) saves the day by uncovering the plot that reaches up to the Minister of Interior. Unfortunately the movie looses itself in some inexplicable plot holes. First of all, the amount of money the SWAT team(under the protection of the MoI) wants to grab amounts only to 500 mil . Really? The European Central Bank alone pumped 1140 billions!!! into the system. So at least they could have transferred some billions of that cyber-money. 500 mil are just peanuts these days, considering the involvement of such high-ups.Then there is the good CIA, that has secret interrogation rooms in Paris, and which threatens the pickpocket with a non-marked flight that would bring him to some black site. They also withhold information from the French law enforcement and, like they do, crack the case on foreign soil w/o any consequences. Good grief, we know the CIA is almighty and does what it wants, but there is no need to play it down and pretend that it's okay what they do, as long they 'get their guy'. And there is the thing with the Minister himself. Who on God's green earth does his dirty work himself, when he's the -ing Minister? But this is a plot element used by quite a few writers.As far as thriller this does not add up. For an action flick it's tolerable.Let's check the technical side, which has a bit more to offer. The stunts are rather okay, some parts a really well done. Kudos to Mr. Elba (and his stuntman)! Filming is for the most part good, directing goes okay. One sour grape is the overuse of that horrid shaky camera in some pursuit scenes - I really hate those. There is such a thing as steady cam and image stabilisation, right? Editing could be a bit more refined, as well as the sound mixing. I presume the director's short resume might be a factor. Lighting and sets go totally okay. There are only a few scenes that look a bit 'cheap'. 2nd unit maybe? Acting is somewhat fair. I never really expect much from action flicks, so... All in all an almost decent action flick. Unfortunately they tried too hard to copy American action movies. Considering that Eurocinema, (especially the French and British movies) has their own style and flair. A bit more Euro-charm would have served the movie well. Not the best movie of the year, but not the worst either.",The Take

78,benj-20839,Watchable Average Action Flick..Straight To DVD style.,5,23 April 2016,"A low budget actioner. It's nicely paced so keeps your attention throughout with pockets of gunplay and fight scenes. The action style isn't anything different but it gets the job done. Some cheesy lines from a typical Euro action script. It isn't anything you haven't seen before but if your fine with that then you'll be satisfied. It ain't no Taken, Transporter or London Has Fallen (all being set in Europe and with that similar feel.) And sadly Idris Elba isn't a Liam Neeson, Jason Statham or Gerard Butler in action-man terms, he'd easily lose a fight between any of them. Yes he is tall and imposing but delivers quite an empty performance, it doesn't seem like he had to make much effort and unfortunately it shows. Maybe the money men behind this production wanted this kind of performance from Mr. Elba but being cool takes a lot more effort than this. If it was a Luc Besson production i think we would have had different results in regards to the action. Its an entertaining one-watch. 5/10",The Take

'But Oh!' my friend said, 'it's set in Paris so that's different'. Not it's not, if you're feeling for an action movie with a terrorist theme complete with the duped unwitting female helper rent out From Paris with Love. It has great action scenes, car chases and kick ass foot chases and great chemistry with Travolta as the cowboy reckless CIA agent. This turkey has Idris Elba who sure, was menacing and always looked locked and loaded in The Wire but that was American made. Here he's so wooden and stiff and well, British. The bro banter simply isn't there, just lame corny lines between 2 Americans in Paris or one american and one 'Black guy with an American accent' - yes, that line is actually said!
Ok, so if you're on the Cultural Studies tip, it's worth watching only to deconstruct that 'funny' line in context. Otherwise, rent From Paris with Love seriously.",The Take

81,toddxdavis,Save your time,3,9 February 2017,"Contrived. Boring. The French to English subtitle translations are heavily Americanized, French don't speak the way this movie shows because it was made to fit the audienceSome scenes where Idris is running or fighting it's easy to see as his interview fir a possible Bond role. The story is not cohesive, zero intrigue, poor acting, and an over attempt to play to current topics make this a disjointed story. It tries to compensate fir lack of substance by faster action and a handful of too-clever moments. There are hundreds of questions and very few answers. My best guess is the movie was made to showcase Elba. He is pitted against the French CIA or some similar agency with moderately witty dialog. The same story of the solo American who is better than the entire foreign department of spies. Skip the movies",The Take
82,Sam-953-169285,Don't think about it,4,7 May 2017,"This is an action/adventure and police story but not a spy story. Any mystery to be solved is typical police investigation.This is probably a great movie for those that enjoy action/adventure movies and don't want to think about it too much.The movie is typical. The American CIA avoids working with the French police. The writers rely on that to give the movie more adventure. The French people are quick to follow the leader in protests, such that they are portrayed as not caring what it is that they are protesting. The French police are not shown doing much to solve the problem except go around beating people up.",The Take
83,pmshah1946,"A whole lot better than so called ""similar movies'",8,21 August 2016,In spite of poor ratings I simply took a chance at watching this Idris Elba movie. Surprise! Surprise! Then I realised why the movie got low ratings. No Werewolves. No Zombies. No sex. No Blood and gore. No bogus action where the hero is absolutely untouched by 3 - 4 guys shooting at him from 20 - 25 feet with assault rifles. Believe me I could do better. These are the typical requirements of the American viewers. Absolutely and totally plausible and believable. Richard Madden also turned out to be familiar face for me. I really wonder if the others here who rated it low really understood what was going on! May be they left their brains home before entering the cinema house. Matt Damon sucks big time compared to Idris Elba. Overall a very watchable movie.,The Take
84,martyncymro,BIG Disappointment,5,24 August 2016,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, especially as it had one of my favourite actors, Idris Elba and the director was James Watkins of Eden Lake fame. The film is set in Paris on the eve of Bastille Day and the plot for the film, while not being novel, was good with several twists and involved a covert CIA team trying to catch a supposed terrorist bomber, who happened to be American. However, why have 3 three main members of the CIA team played by British actors and why have the supposed American terrorist also played by a British actor. I know Hollywood is full of non-Americans playing American roles, but the poor accents made it hard to take the film seriously. It would have been far better if it had been the British security service and a British supposed terrorist. I suspect the American theme was done with a view to the American cinema market. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to watch, but don't expect anything special.",The Take
85,kyliem11,Descent action movie.,7,24 April 2016,"Idris Elba is well cast as Sean Briar, a CIA agent on the trail of a Paris bomber. He is a bit of a 'one tough guy against the world' type character who he plays very well. It's a bit of a job application for the James Bond roll, but is an enjoyable thriller nonetheless.Richard Madden plays, Michael Mason, a cheeky pickpocket, who steals a handbag that, unbeknown to him, contains a bomb. When the bomb explodes Mason becomes Paris's most wanted and is hunted by Briar. There is a great chemistry between the two leads and although the story is a little predictable it bubbles along nicely with some good action scenes and stunts.The movie is nothing special, but throw in the wit of Mason and you have a descent movie with a few laughs for good measure.",The Take
86,godfreyanywar,Pretty mediocre,4,5 November 2018,"Starts of good but becomes really bad soon after. They should've made it an all french movie maybe it would've been better then, rather than have two main British actors doing an American accent which was sub-par by both. Worth watching if your bored",The Take

88,vradenburgjerry,A cheesy mess,3,22 September 2020,"First off they are forcing a relationship between Elba and madden that's clearly not there. So it makes it hard to find any humor or connection with the characters. No charm whatsoever. Also, what's with half the movies Dialogue not there? No subtitles? It was very predictable, no originality. Elba was the only good thing about this movie. Just a very poor attempt.",The Take
89,eloy_lb,The mighty American,1,27 December 2016,"Spoilers. Beware. This movie started well but soon shifted to an unbelievable stupid story where the mighty Americans save the day. Sure, who are the stupid french police? We are the Americans, get out of the way! The story is bullsh*t. It must have been written by a bunch of extremists so to say that all the bombings in France were done by others then extremists and that they have nothing to do with it. This is the politics face of the story. Now, American hero wise, the mighty CIA agent, single handedly, outsmarted what should be the best police force in France (They call it RAPID in the movie, but they were targeting the RAID force). They were dropping like a house of cards from a single punch or like mosquitoes from a single blow. Come on, give the RAID some credit!",The Take

93,jordan_bel,"Poor, very poor",3,16 January 2017,"I don't bash every bad movie I watch otherwise that would be a full time job. Just saw this one on Amazon Prime -would not have bothered otherwise- and it makes a good distraction when you are ironing your shirts, but not more. Action sequences are OK, not great, not bad. The rest is terrible, the scenario ridiculous, the characters very forgettable. Shame when you put together actors like Idris Elba, Kelly Reilly (Pot luck, the Russian dolls) and Charlotte Le Bon (the hundred foot journey). Jose Garcia lands another weird role after Tout schuss which is even worse. 3/10 just for the action. Come on Idris do something!",The Take
94,wingzero203,Refreshingly Raw and No-Nonsense Entertainment,9,29 November 2020,"Considering there are no shortage of ridiculously unrealistic buddy cop and team-up style action & espionage movies in existence, this movie is refreshingly raw and gritty. That is, no over-the-top humor, very realistic fighting scenes, and a plot that could actually happen considering the current political climate.They definitely combine the themes of terrorism and corruption with a splash of espionage in this movie which wouldn't surprise me if this art is truly imitating life. Idris Elba's CIA operative character is competent but not perfect. He's not a clichéd, overpowered Jason Bourne super agent who can speak six languages and win every fist and gun fight. And Elba's body language & swag (along with playing an espionage agent) basically makes this an indirect audition for him to take on the 007 mantle in the future.With the exception of Elba's character speaking to his CIA people and his two co-stars, the majority of the movie is in French with, of course, subtitles. Not sure why this is a complaint with other reviewers (the movie takes place in...wait for it...France). If you can read subtitles, you can follow the movie just fine.Bottom line, don't expect grand car chases, obligatory international breathtaking scenery, or some overcomplicated plot. If you can do without the excess movie-making flair, puns, and clichés of traditional espionage movies, you'll enjoy this flick.",The Take

96,jamdub-61934,This is a good one!,7,27 February 2017,"If you like Paris, as I do, the film looks great and gives you the travel bug. The plot was very good. I was surprised. CIA meets pickpocket, and of course, he picks the wrong pocket. I thought they developed the pickpocket's character well, not so much Idris' character, but it still worked. The action scenes are well done and the editing is not bad. Usually on the lower budget movies, editing or sound suffers. That is not the case here. A bigger budget this would have been a hit in America as well.7 stars.",The Take
97,zlifb,A xenophobic romp,7,21 August 2017,"The action runs at full throttle throughout from Paris rooftop pursuit, a bomb, car chases, several full-on fights, to a bank robbery in the midst of a riot.The acting is solid, the dialogue not bad and the characters just a bit more than two dimensional. The story is quite convoluted but not too hard to follow, if a little predictable in places. Talking of predictable, the bullet-proof all-American hero single- handedly solving the world's problems is a tiresome theme. Why must Hollywood consistently portray the rest of the world as stupid, inept, racist and corrupt? Self-projection maybe?",The Take

Then you have your answer right here.It's a fast paced, no-nonsense action spy thriller, without a single piece of originality. But it manages to present all the borrowed bits and pieces in a way, to deliver a very entertaining experience.The main character is almost a carbon copy of the title character in Luther, so Elba naturally revels in the role. They even managed to include one of my favorite lines from Luther, the little thieves. Which is funny since the second main character is actually a thief in this. Self irony maybe? The movie never slows down, not for a minute. I haven't seen anything like it for quite some time. There is less Neutral Gear in here, than in Luc Bessson's original Taxi.Of course you shouldn't expect a masterpiece. The characters are all shallow, and the story is predictable. It doesn't even try to be clever, it just gives you everything at face value.",The Take
102,ksteevens,Great movie for its genre. Funny and full of action,8,5 January 2019,"Great movie for its genre. Plenty of humour and action without the bad CGI, ridiculous stunts, or corny unnecessary banter you find in some movies. Nice twist as well.",The Take

104,halsall-07142,"Okay, but not as good as similar films.",4,7 May 2016,"From director James Watkins is a foray into the action genre with Bastille Day. His past work has been primarily in horror, with acclaimed hits Eden Lake and Woman in Black.Set in Paris a con man, Michael (Richard Madden), steals a bag belonging to Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) which unknowingly to him contains a bomb. When the device detonates in the city centre CIA agent Sean Briar (Idris Elba) is put in charge of tracking Michael down.Idris Elba and Richard Madden play off against each other very well, Elba as the super serious Briar and Madden as the immature conman have great chemistry together. Elba is blessed with a natural charisma that makes him easy to watch even when armed with the most underwritten of characters. Whilst Richard Madden holds his own as an entertaining pickpocket, with a few humorous moments. Neither of the pair completely master the American accents, but we're also not in Dick Van Dyke territory so it doesn't become too off putting. The action is suitably slick and steadily directed, though there are a lot of rapid cuts which threaten to break the cohesion of the action. The camera does remain steady though allowing most of the fight scenes to remain coherent. The style seems evocative of the Bourne Ultimatum and Taken, without ever excelling beyond either of these modern action favourites. The pickpocketing scenes are presented stylishly and are entertaining, especially compared to something like Focus from last year that made Will Smith's thief seem somehow super-powered. However despite being superior in these circumstances Bastille Day constantly seems to be an imitation of other popular features released in the past few years without ever developing into something more unique. Setting the movie in Paris against the backdrop of the current tensions following the terrorist attacks is a weird choice for a film that seemingly doesn't want to delve into such a highly divisive issue. The conflicted atmosphere of the cities multicultural classes is extorted by the films plot, but is never explored beyond the simplistic. Kelly Reilly is wasted as one of Briar's co-workers; in a part that could have been portrayed by a box with the words ""unimportant character"" written on it. To have such a talented performer like Kelly Reilly in such a pointless role is mind boggling. Whilst Anatol Yusef (of Boardwalk Empire fame) is Briar's superior, the one who likes to do things by the book and hates Briar for being such a loose cannon. Yusef is little more than a cliché obstacle whose main service to the narrative is to recite expositional backstory on other characters.As a whole Bastille Day is little more than a run of the mill actioner, with nods to Taken, Focus and even Die Hard it struggles to find its own path. Elba and Madden do a fine job together, but there isn't much too either of their characters worth thinking about. If you're a fan of action then this may be something worth checking out, but be aware that there isn't anything revolutionary about this Bastille Day.",The Take
105,jeff-44082,If this is what stands for a 6/10 IMDB I'm raising my bar to nothing less than 7,4,8 May 2018,"This is at best a 4/10 straight to TV movie so only watch if you have nothing else in mind. It's not deserving of its IMDB 6.3 score in the slightest and surely must have been manipulated or voted up by the Idris Elba fan club
At the half way mark you will question whether to stop the movie or see it through. 
The acting, plot and production all got significantly worse as the movie progressed and even the end credits are no respite from Idris Elba's terribleness as he offers an ear murdering croak of a spoken word song that to be fair does reward the viewer with confirmation that this is truly an awful movie. Idris you can do better than risk your career leading such a weak script with laughable dialogue and by a writer/director with so little experience which is largely from a few tv shows. 
If this is what now stands for a 6/10 from IMDB I'm raising my bar to never watching anything under a 7.",The Take

107,johnnydicksonjr,Poor Captions.,6,20 September 2020,"I speak English. This movie was made in English it says. That is the only language they offer us with hearing disabilities. I watched the movie with captions on with Netflix . When English was spoken the captions showed up just fine. However when the actors spoke in Italian there were NO captions at all. You'd expect a movie where about 1/2 the dialogue was in a language to have the transition captions built right into the movie for those of us who do not speak Italian. So the bottom line is that the movie was basically understandable in English for about 50% of the movie. I really think this would fall to the editing department. I could be wrong but NO awards for whatever department that fell flat on their faces and failed & spoiled the whole movie for EVERYONE who starred in, or had a hand a hand in making this film, right down to the viewers",The Take

109,DirtyTracksuitBillinEpisode32,I come you know French,8,20 September 2020,"The subtitles for this film absolutely suck. Whenever the characters speak french, the translations only come up when they say basic, easily understood phrases. A large portion of this film is characters speaking in French, with the viewer having absolutely no clue what they are talking about... unless they speak French themselves.Other than that, I really enjoyed this film. I saw it shortly after it came out when I rented it through redbox, but my most recent viewing of it was just a few days ago, via netflix. I think both Idris Elba and Richard Madden are both believable in their roles. Idris plays a strong lawman who often goes with his intuition, which is often against his superiors' wishes. It's nothing new, but he excels in the role. Richard plays a good-hearted pickpocket who unwittingly plays a part in a terror attack. Despite being a criminal, he is out of his element throughout most of the film, and he comes off as a guy that's trying to clear his name and stay alive in the process.Again, both leads are very believable.My favourite parts to this film are whenever Richard's character is committing his acts of thievery, and there are several of these scenes. They always are different and very entertaining.",The Take

It was interesting to see Madden who is from Game of Thrones, he looked familiar but I didn't realise it was him until after the filmThe acting was good by Idris, no typical annoying clichés like: -> doing this for a relative -> 30 trained people shooting, but no one can hit a target. -> love interest to tap into a different demographic.I think could have been a 10, if the movie had a less predictable ending.",The Take
115,mcpatti,Idris Elba just made his audition tape for Bond!,7,20 August 2019,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It wasn't deep and it wasn't meant to be. The action was excellent. I especially liked when Idris' character stops Madden's character as he believes he has escaped the Marketplace on the motor bike. Idris stops him cold and that was just cool. I prefer Idris in Luther but I will take him any way I can watch him. I hope someone gives him a proper opportunity to show his skills. Always a joy when he is on the screen.

The great cast is very let down however, (especially the under-used Kelly Reilly), by rough and heavy-handed editing. Any depth, connection, or richness just got pulled out of the edited story. We really could have used about 20-25 more minutes to this thing, instead of the action-only version we got presented with. It seems it started out as a good concept, with some good planned twists (all of which are pretty 'Eh' when they actually happen), so it left me feeling a little disappointed, all in all. The 'buddy' feeling in the film just never developed as it obviously was supposed to, either.",The Take

You might be inclined not to watch it because of all these reviews that state ""I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH, AND WITHOUT TRANSLATION I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!"" But you absolutely do not need to understand the French dialogue in order to enjoy this movie! Use your best judgement on the French speaking scenes and you will be okay. Just roll with the punches. Idris Elba does a killer job at playing both good/bad cop. Richard Madden also brings his A game. Such an original storyline gives a great and thrilling movie! It also shines a light on how serious the pressure can be in certain religious groups, even if the main motive isn't religion, but just solely peer pressure from other people.

122,wilkinsonalan-19160,Enjoyable romp,7,31 August 2016,"Whilst the movie concept is dated and extremely ironic, this is an enjoyable thriller. There is much media speculation regarding Idris Elba becoming the next Bond, possibly this was a pseudo-showcase of his potential? It is hard to see why he would otherwsie have taken on this project?Idris is a talented and charismatic actor. However, why become Bond? There must be a plethora of scripts for him to undertake similar characterisations to greater effect?The Bond movie franchise is something of a dinosaur, I would urge Idris Elba to create something different - he is a huge, trans-Atlantic star that does not require the Bond franchise to propel him. The Bond movies err toward big budget action, sacrificing a really well-crafted story. I would encourage Idris to ditch the action hero and look toward something more sentient like a Le Carre movie, with greater depth and longevity. Also, would like to see those novels remain within the time they were written - as they make so much more sense. Bond would be so much better if it had remained in the early 60s era...Idris dealing with a 60s world could also, potentially, involve some political statement?Bastille Day has a couple of plot twists, appears to have been budget-conscious and for the most part is predictable. It harks toward thrillers of the past. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable, but ultimately - forgettable.",The Take
123,redpaperweight,American & Capitalist propaganda well displayed,5,14 January 2018,"Alba is a great actor and often plays very well, his performance here was mediocre but still enjoyable. As an action movie it does indeed deliver on action, the story itself however...
..is something completely different. Not only does the story show off the ""amazing"" Americans by saving the corrupt and incompetent French from a possible terrorist attack in Paris, the story also portrays capitalist propaganda in quite a grasping and striking way. This propaganda enters in two steps: (1) the protesters are given quite some attention and keep being labeled as purely anti-fascist to show that they are indeed good guys, the moment they actually charge the police lines and break through is nearly euphoric; (2) then however enters the second step which pretty much annuls the former by showing us that we indeed may protest but the money that is accumulated by banks and the elite is not ours to take, we may not steal from them as it are their own 'rightful' assets. 
The French policemen have come to the desperate decision to take the money from the federal reserve as their group was failed by the administration after the loss of 2 team members during a previous operation. They wanted to get even as they felt undervalued and disrespected, now whose fault is that? 
We can be mad and we may be upset about the inequality or the insane amounts of accumulation over our own backs, but we better not dare to take it back. We may enter the lobby of a bank, shouting and protesting, the vault however is off-limits.",The Take

We know he's got it in him - but it wasn't here. Richard Madden... someone PLEASE get him a voice/dialect coach that is an actual American. One good thing - it IS watchable in the same kind of way that grey's anatomy is watchable. Suspension of disbelief and the recognition it is ridiculous.

126,SimonB27,Very good no-nonsense thriller - better than Bond any day,8,6 May 2016,"Why did I like his film?.. because it's a no-nonsense action movie, good characters, well-acted with a sensible plot and script. It doesn't waste its or my time with silly globe-trotting locations, implausible Aston Martins, costume changes, larger than life villains or impossibly glamorous love-interests.You get what you pay for and, without all the pretentious crap, you actually get more of what you are paying for.A number of reviewers have lamented the lack of budget but if that means we get a tense claustrophobic thriller based in one city instead of Bond tearing up one city before impossibly evading all law enforcement to arrive immediately in another city with an entirely new wardrobe and armoury to tear that one up too then hooray for small budgets. Think of every way the last three Bond films have annoyed you with their ludicrous locations, grandiloquent set pieces, irritating in-jokes, preposterous gadgets, pompous (and insultingly inconsistent) self-references, contrived plots and ego-centric main character without whom it would seem a lot more people would stay alive. Well this film doesn't; it just gets on with plot and character and action keeping everything tight and exciting.Idris Elba is excellent if a little terrifying using his sheer size and presence to great effect. Richard Madden also plays well against his Rob Stark type as a weak and frightened character, not the instant hero you get in so many movies. Other characters are good too including the wonderful Thierry Godard from Spiral.Yes the budget is lower than a blockbuster Bond film and the film is the better for it. It's much more in the style of the early Bourne or Taken movies. The rooftop chase is far more realistic than any Bond film with people slipping and sliding about dangerously, knocking over chimney pots and generally looking rather scared rather than as though this is something they have trained for for months. I'm quite sure real CIA agents actually spend most of their time in unglamourous locations, in unglamourous cars and this film is the more realistic for showing it that way.If you want to see a good tight realistic (so far as it goes obviously) thriller go and see this film and give it the support it deserves. If you like pretty shiny things and shots of holiday destinations and don't care about why a secret agent tasked with the one job of keeping the head of the secret service alive would fail to do just that by playing Home Alone in Scotland instead of just placing one call for backup, then go see a Bond film instead.Elba would be wasted in a Bond film but he was excellent in this well made thriller that is better than a Bond film any day of the week.",The Take

Was skeptical of it being low quality b-movie action rubbish but ventured into the flick due to Elba. Glad I did, it's not without it's flaws, but honestly in Hollywoods' super slick constant cgi blockbuster vomitfest, who doesn't miss a few flaws like the crackle from a vinyl record. My only complaint with the whole movie as an American is, why didn't they let the actors use their cool British accents? I mean the accents weren't awful but c'mon. Too bad they didn't re-write it as MI6 instead of CIA etc. It's not entirely unpredictable, but it's good and worthy of a sequel. Maybe Elba can start the next film in a coma and wake up with a British accent for unexplained medical reasons. Thoroughly enjoyable, with a Layer Cake kind of feel in tone and production to it IMO.

137,keith-46507,Great action movie idris elba kicked a$$,10,10 February 2021,Finally a story that you can actually follow!! All the cast to a great job here especially Idris Elba. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.,The Take
138,jaimeehernandez,Hope you know French...,5,20 September 2020,"Ok action movie. The use of subtitles was very poor. A lot of dialog is in French and most of it was not sub titled which would have added with character narratives, maybe.",The Take
139,rwgtfgm,This was absolutely amazing.,10,27 September 2021,Literally turn on subtitles and it translates all of the french . Just watched the whole movie and it translated every word so maybe netflix changed it. The action is actually really dope and the plot has some pretty good twists .,The Take
140,yves-najman,Even Elba is disappointing,4,17 August 2016,"The movie was scheduled in France around 14 of July 2016, and was removed from the schedule when the terrorist attack took place in Nice, to avoid hurting feelings. This gave probably an unexpected boost to the interest in the movie. For me, Idriss Elba was one of the two reasons I (reluctantly) watch this piece of movie, the second being a very good trailer, way above the actual movie. And I had regrets after the first 10mns and even remorse after the next 20mns. Everything, from plot to acting is rubbish, the most laughable part being the conspiracy. Actions scenes are decent, though, but quite far from the first Bourne movie. I have the feeling that the targeted audience was, in fact, French: some decent actors, with a decent acting, in a realistic Paris. But it could be me being French...",The Take
141,geeman002,I would love to watch this movie,6,20 September 2020,"But a half or so is in French, with no English subtitles, or at least very inconsistent ones.
It might be good, Idris is always great, but I lost the plot because I don't know what half the people in the movie were saying. Shoddy production.",The Take
142,jimolear,Good movie,8,10 October 2020,Lots of twists and turns but not too confusing. Good acting. Good videography. Worth the watch.,The Take
143,gblaufuss,Stared out pretty OK...,5,10 October 2020,"I haven't ever seen a movie that had so much potential in the beginning and dropped off so fast as this one. It was almost like two different flicks. Sappy, sappy and sappy after about 1.25 hours. Yes, I watched it until the end because I kept hoping that it would get better. Kelly Rielly is a great actor so f you're going to pay her to show up to act, use her man.",The Take
144,jtomasello2,Fairly exciting ...,4,6 September 2018,"This is another one of those Hollywood lefty films. Accordingly, cops all over the world (in this case France) are either dirty or just plain stupid! Of course, there is always one rogue cop around, in this case, Idris Elba who fulfills the role quite adequately. It's an exciting film with the usual car and/or foot chases and the bad guys will certainly be done in. So now that I've seen it, I will get rid of my Blu-ray copy and hope I can find one more interesting.",The Take
145,aelliott-3,great story,8,23 September 2020,Great flick. enjoyed rob stark lol subtitles help.,The Take
146,margensq,Wasting time..!!,2,19 August 2016,"Watching this movie is wasting time, at least for me. I watch this movie because of the reviews before me said that this is better than Bourne. Even though I have not seen that movie yet, but I've seen the Jason Bourne series before and it was a great movie except The Bourne Legacy, and if someone says that this is better than Bourne, it's must be something. Well, I think I'm just trapped of his review. I thought this is even worse than the boil in the butt. And Idris Elba? he can't even run properly especially when they have to running on top of the roof, like he was scared or afraid to slip, or he probably think the roof will be broke-down? Come on man, this an action movie, right..!?",The Take
147,markperini,"Half the dialogue is in French, with no English subtitles",7,20 September 2020,"Half the dialogue is in French, with no English subtitles. Once in a while there will be subtitles for one or two words of French dialogue, indicating that some made at least a small effort. Interestingly, watching this movie on Netflix, all the English dialogue had close captioned subtitles.",The Take
148,willo_soso,Loved it,9,29 March 2019,"Idris Alba is a really good actor, he can be in action or drama 👏🏻, and this is one of my favorite",The Take
149,tietjenw,Subtitles,3,22 September 2020,"Probably decent if one speaks French fluently, as well as English. Half the dialogue is in French without subtitles. Bah Humbug!",The Take
150,wendycluff-16980,Great action movie,8,19 September 2020,Loved the foot race on the rooftops of paris. Would have given it 10 if the english subtitles were there for french conversations.,The Take
151,ariellesmithe,No English subtitles--can't understand 1/2 the movie,2,22 September 2020,"Don't waste your time if you don't speak French. 1/2 the movie is in French with no English subtitles. So, you have no idea what is really happening.I must say that for a movie of this caliber, this is a huge disappointment!",The Take
152,chertann-40424,Idris excellence!!,10,5 October 2020,4 years later I sincerely wish I could have given them kudos when it came out. Much action! Much suspense! Everything I could ask for.,The Take
153,tjmipusf,I've seen better acting in a 4th grade play,1,13 January 2021,I don't know if the director wanted everyone to not act or not but it's horrible. I think they told Rob stark to do his worst John Snow impression. A total waste of time.,The Take
154,paleopunch,Excellent,9,24 May 2021,"This was a really good movie, very entertaining. Yea, you know who will win in the end, but that's almost always the case. It's how you get there, which is the fun part. Don't listen to the naysayers. And unlike what some have said, the subtitles are fine. I guess they fixed the problem.",The Take
155,rcrumpiii,Movie was very entertaining with clever plot twists!,10,19 November 2016,"This movie The Take, was much better than I thought it would be based upon the critic reviews. It was as good or better than the last two Bourne offerings or any of the Jack Reacher products. The Plot twists were very different and the political insights and implications were very timely and eye opening.The fight scenes were very realistic and plausible. Idris Alba is a star and he was outstanding.I wish the title was more descriptive and I think this movie could have benefited from more advertising. All in all very entertaining, job well done! I hope they make a sequel.",The Take
156,leonard-craft,Good Action,7,3 July 2021,This was a great action movie. The movie held my interest for the full hour and a half. I enjoyed the close hand to hand combat. There was an interesting twist. I really enjoyed watching Idris Elba. Overall very enjoyable movie to watch.,The Take
157,antbelkin,Action in the best standard of Snatch and Lock stock and two smoking barrels.,10,20 August 2020,The best standard of Snatch and Lock stock and two smoking barre,The Take
158,colinwillsgibson,A great thriller,8,23 April 2016,"Surprised this isn't at least in the 7's on here. Elba is excellent, no cheesy crap Bond esque love interests. Just a proper thriller with some great twists and decent action sequences. Some comical moments in a non Marvel universe cheesy way. Nothing incredibly new with the plot, but it does keep you interested for the duration. The end hints at a sequel, which could be interesting.If you like a good action / thriller - this is the best I've seen in a long while. Not quite as good as the old Bournes, but certainly better than recent Bonds.",The Take
159,robtemple1017,"I don't speak French, thank you.",7,22 September 2020,"Good movie, but ALOT of French spoken and not translated/subtitled, so no idea what they're saying for long stretches.",The Take
160,billrobinson95051,Mediocre at best. Worth a watch just do not pay to much for the opportunity.,5,2 September 2016,"The actor who played the thief and the lady who was the bomb holder are unfamiliar to me. Idris Elba? Man what a waste of his time and energy. I like this guy and he is much to good an actor for this mediocrity. This movie was easily predictable after a while and really the only surprises were what the thief was doing to prove how good a thief he actually was. The cops in the movie? BORING, after you find out the head cop is the instigator of all the bad things happening in the flick. That is it no more surprises. Attacking Bastille? Come on, I did basic training at Ft Knox where there used to be at least a Division of Tanks. Two squads of regular police and a squad of SWAT cops?!!! For all those protesters? Guarding billions in gold and electronic money that the bad guys stole with a thumb drive?!! Nope, not buying it. It's worth watching but I'm really disappointed in Mr Elba for making this flick. Whoever talked him into it should be shot. Don't waste your money on this one, wait till it comes out on DVD or something.",The Take
161,andrehayek,Great movie,10,18 July 2016,"I watched this movie some months ago in a Lebanese cinema, and I found that it's a great movie. Differently from most of the reviews say, this movie satisfied me to a high level. It contained action, real life problems, lessons for audience to learn, a good light kind of comedy and some more good stuff for you to discover. I gave this movie a 10 (excellent) not because it's really excellent or better than ""The Dark Knight"" but because it is really underrated from the reviewers and it deserves much more better rates. I wish I could tell you the whole story but I don't like to be the spoiler haha, go ahead and watch this movie to discover how good and exciting it is! And well mentioning the watching part, it might be hard for you to do it if you were in some parts of Europe like France and I don't know specifically which countries and also of course in Lebanon, because it has been pulled out from France after the last truck massacre (Nice). In addition to that they didn't yet make the wide release, and it can't be normally found over the internet. Please if you have the movie file, or a link, private message me :) Good luck watching this great thriller!",The Take
162,lbcook-42931,Language barrier,7,20 September 2020,"I always use subtitles since I don't hear well.The spoken English was subtitled, which was helpful, but the long spoken exchanges between the French police/tactical/intelligence was spoken in French, but NONE of the French dialog WAS TRANSLATED and SUBTITLED.Maybe not a huge issue except that the 'good guys' had maybe ten pages of dialog between them. The French speakers provided about 80% of 'The Take's' total spoken word.Now, Idris Elba is the caliber of actor who doesn't need to chatter in order to get his thoughts out.Still, with the Strong, Silent Type in the lead, there was no way to follow the plot. When we thought we'd identified the villians, we had to watch and wait for another character's confirmation of events.I don't know who's responsible for subtitles...but really, our phones can transcribe a spoken voice message. We can speak to lock our doors, turn off our lights, and play our favorite music.#pleasefixsubtitles",The Take
163,cpbartlett-02191,Good action flick,8,12 October 2020,"It IS a foreign film. If you have issues with subtitles, just don't watch it. It's kind of like Die Hard meets Jason Boerne quality. Just put your settings on close captioning and you'll get it all....😉",The Take
164,zaiphenndan,The good Americans!,2,2 June 2016,"Yes, they did it again! They have saved the World. Thank God they are Americans, because if they were from some place else, I would probably thought that the movie was an absolute fraud. Those greedy French people (police) that want to steal money from trier own bank and they do it by lying the people through terrorist attacks that they have made up... and again the Americans (CIA) who apparently know way more about the French, who know nothing at all - they don't know what is happening in their own country. It is 2016, something dramatically has to change in the American cinema as it is scratching the bottom of the ocean. Good actors - stars from hit TV shows, THE WIRE and GAME OF THRONES, but that doesn't help bad written story, whit 1 000 000 plot holes and again....the GOD Americans! Propaganda, HELLO! I am putting 2 stars, because there was one good scene in that awful peace of film.",The Take
165,tntula,locations are ridiculous...,7,17 July 2017,"while the movie is fairly good and keeps your attention with non-stop action.... the location usage is ridiculous to anyone who has been to Paris... take for example the chase scene... first it starts at what appears to be around the 16th Arr, and then suddenly he jumps through a window and is now near les halles and hotel de ville.. and then when he runs though les halles and he exits and gets caught, he suddenly is kilometers away in the suburbs near mairie de lilas metro at a small covered outdoor market.. lol.... .. other are just as ridiculous... ...",The Take
