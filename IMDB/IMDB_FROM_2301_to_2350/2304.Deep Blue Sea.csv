0,Leofwine_draca,"Cheesy, but lots of well-directed suspense to make up for it",7,12 June 2016,"The latest blockbuster is a refreshingly enjoyable and old-fashioned kind of thriller, full of action, suspense, and plenty of humour. In a year which has given us many oddities at the cinema, this comes across as a breath of fresh air, as it doesn't try anything inventive or new, it's just a plain simplistic adventure story. In many ways DEEP BLUE SEA harks back to the likes of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, albeit with a monster-movie twist.Of course, with Renny Harlin as the director, it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that this film would offer up some exciting sequences. And, by gum, it does, as people are chased up corridors by sharks, having to swim for their lives and using everyday facilities as their only means of salvation; there are no rocket launchers or shotgun-toting heroes this time around, although Thomas Jane comes close.Unfortunately, when the film is not dealing with one of these terrific action scenes, it all comes a bit unstuck. The music is uninspired and some of the cast disappoint. I know Harlin said he wanted to cast unknown actors and actresses in the film, I can understand that, but come on, he could have chosen someone who can actually act. Thomas Jane is acceptable, but was better in the likes of THE PUNISHER. As for Saffron Burrows, talk about miscasting. She has a ridiculous accent and is a poor actress when it comes to the action scenes, having the same expression on her face for the entire film.The rest of the cast are all also bland and interchangeable, we don't really care if these guys live or die. The only interest comes from the two black cast members, firstly there's the reliable Samuel Jackson as a cool company benefactor back when he could do no wrong, and then there's LL Cool J, who, surprisingly, is actually funny and likeable in this film. No mean feat for a rap artist, and I was expecting the worst. It turns out that LL Cool J is the one we're rooting for and the only real person we actually care about when he's in danger. There's a turn up for the books.There are some bloody moments in this film for shock purposes, the best being early on. For the next twenty minutes events just get worse, people die, buildings explode and the entire base gets flooded, these multiplying calamities are just sheer brilliance and really exciting and entertaining. It really made my heart beat. There's no way the rest of the film could live up to this moment, and it can't, but at least it concentrates on the sharks as the real stars and not the actors.The special effects for the sharks are generally very good, and a seamless blend of animatronics and CGI animation is used. Only occasionally (at the end particularly) do the sharks look fake, but other than that they're very well done indeed. There are also plenty of shots of people getting ripped in half underwater and legs flailing about, quite fake too but fun anyway. However the old standby of someone sinking and then blood welling up in the water is the most effective and clichéd of the lot, but it works.While comparisons to JAWS are obvious (the two films are very different DEEP BLUE SEA is action orientated, JAWS is more of a suspense story), just forget about that classic and sit back and enjoy some inspired moments and good chase bits, and play 'guess the next victim' with your friends. It's a riot. DEEP BLUE SEA may not break any new ground, but there are some excellent disaster moments (the large window cracking being one of them, it might have been nicked from THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK but it's a whole lot better) and there are plenty of things to divert your senses from the somewhat shallow nature of the film - no pun intended.",Deep Blue Sea
1,SnoopyStyle,Camp action but too stupid,5,29 December 2013,"Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) leads a team of scientists in Aquatica, an offshore research lab, to cure brain diseases like Alzheimer's. After a terrifying escaped test shark, investor Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) goes out to investigate. The scientists are expanding the brains of sharks, but the Harvard Genetics Compact doesn't allow the sharks to be genetically modified. At least, they are not supposed to.None of it makes that much sense. Why built a facility offshore? Why not just built big tanks like an aquarium? If all they're doing is raise sharks, there has got to be an easier way. It's begging for trouble when the next big storm to hit. The whole thing doesn't past the smell taste. If you can get past the stink, there are some fun action and some water games. But I would mostly recommend against watching this.",Deep Blue Sea
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Don't mess with Mother Nature.,6,3 June 2017,"Doctor McAlester carries out tests on Sharks, in order to discover a cure for Alzheimer's. The testing increases the brain activity of the sharks, making them more intelligent. When a storm hits the underwater base and it floods, the forces of creation are set loose.The casting is a little bit hit and miss, Saffron Burrows carries the film fairly well, Thomas Jane is quite good, Stellan Skarsgård is good but doesn't get enough time. LL Cool J's character was badly written, he didn't have much of a chance.I love the idea of hyper intelligent sharks, predators I would have thought are super in intelligence to begin with made more so, there are some good ideas on show.CGI effects ahead of their time, the sharks look fantastic. I still love the scene where Jackson is eaten, arguably the most memorable thing about the film.Soppy and definitely silly at times, how Presented her survived Lord only knows, and then manages to kill The Mako. That awful line 'take me back to the ghetto,' bad.A typical base under write from a clever monster film, but there's enough laughs and goings on to keep you entertained. 6/10",Deep Blue Sea

The problem with approaching a shark movie is how do you do it without repeating Jaws?"" That is precisely the problem with shark movies. There have been dozens of them, but it all comes back to ""Jaws"" (even if ""Jaws"" was not the first). Luckily, they approached this the right way -- nodding to Spielberg and carrying on.Roger Ebert wrote, ""In a genre where a lot of movies are retreads of the predictable, 'Deep Blue Sea' keeps you guessing."" From a horror-basher like Ebert, that is quite a compliment. But also, this one has the cast to make even a retread work. Thomas Jane pre-Punisher, Sam Jackson, Michael Rapaport? This is gold.",Deep Blue Sea
4,lee_eisenberg,SLJ didn't get to use his important word in any of his movies from 1999!,5,2 November 2019,"Renny Harlin spent the '90s as one of the purveyors of action cinema: ""Cutthroat Island"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", and ""Deep Blue Sea"". This is one of the many horror flicks about enhanced predators that turn on humans. And let's face it, if you've seen one shark movie, you've seen 'em all. The innovative horror flick from summer 1999 was ""The Blair Witch Project"", which trounced the no-plot ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (seriously, how could the director behind ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""2001"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"" end his career with something so crummy?).My point is that in a year that gave us TBWP, ""The Matrix"", ""Election"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""American Beauty"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Being John Malkovich"", this hardly registers. Unless of course you're in for some nice, brainless fun. Alas, you won't hear Samuel L. Jackson use the word that he's presumably supposed to use in every role (hint: it appeared on his wallet in ""Pulp Fiction"").I can never think of LL Cool J without realizing that he's the only rapper to have ever co-starred with one of Alfred Hitchcock's icy blondes (with Janet Leigh in ""Halloween H20"").",Deep Blue Sea
5,jboothmillard,Deep Blue Sea,6,12 July 2005,"From director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, The Long Kiss Goodnight), I didn't really pay full attention to this the first time, but the second time I took more notice. Basically Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) needs funding for her new brain re-activation facility, and she is allowing investigator Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) to look over their progress. When he arrives at Aquatica, he meets fellow scientist Jim Whitlock (Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsgård), and the rest of the team: marine biologist Janice Higgins (Jacqueline McKenzie), engineer Tom 'Scoggs' Scoggins (Michael Rapaport), shark expert Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), meteorologist Brenda Kerns (Aida Turturro) and chef Sherman ""Preacher"" Dudley (LL Cool J). They have experimented and genetically re-engineered large Waco sharks, and one is captured to test in the lab to see whether or not a blood sample can cure a brain sample infected by Alzheimer's Disease, and it proves successful. However, things start going wrong when a the shark wakes up and bites off Jim's arm, and the other two sharks follow suit and cause Aquatica to start flooding. The survivors of the structural collapse know that they have to get out before Aquatica completely floods, and they are having to go against the rush of the deep sea water, and of course the dangerously intelligent sharks, oh yeah, the experiments made them smarter. One by one the survivors are killed by either the destruction of the facility, or more often the sharks coming after them, and in the end, the last three to reach the surface are Carter, Susan and Preacher. They realise though that the sharks have been playing them all along, two of them have been killed, but the last one they know wants to get out to the open sea, so Susan sacrifices herself and the other two try to blow it up. It is basically an excuse to spice up the tricks and traits invented in Jaws, with a B movie cast, that all do well, especially Jackson and Cool J. There are plenty of jumpy and bloody moments, and some good tension, if it is wasn't for this it might just be an average science fiction action thriller, but it isn't. Good!",Deep Blue Sea
6,Tweekums,Silly but exciting shark thriller,8,29 January 2020,"As part of a project to cure Alzheimer's disease scientist Dr Susan McAlester has been experimenting with the brains of mako sharks; now her funding is under threat. As a side effect the sharks seem to be getting more intelligent. The experiments are taking place in a floating laboratory constructed on a disused World War Two submarine pen. Shortly after Russell Franklin, an executive representing the firm sponsoring the experiments arrives things start going wrong. A shark bites a seriously injures one scientist. Then as a rescue helicopter arrives during a storm they cause it to crash. This destabilises the facility causing it to start to flood. Now the sharks can get in and hunt down the survivors. The motivation for their precise actions aren't immediately obvious but they do appear to have a plan.When a new shark attack films arrives it will always compared to 'Jaws' and will always be found inferior... this is no different. That doesn't mean it is a bad film though. The story provides plenty of thrills from start to finish and not everything goes as expected; characters the viewer will expect to die don't and others we are sure will survive die relatively early in the proceedings. The idea of 'smart sharks' may be pure sci-fi but they are effective and it explains actions which would otherwise seem ridiculous. The way the story plays out in the increasingly flooded structure reminded me of 'Alien' more than 'Jaws'; in fact one scene in a flooded elevator shaft is almost identical to a scene in 'Alien Resurrection'! The cast is impressive featuring the likes of Samuel L Jackson, Stellen Skarsgard, LL Cool J and Saffron Burrows amongst others. While this is mostly about the scares there are touches of humour; mostly from LL Cool J's character, the facility cook, who is likeably funny without ever being the designated 'comedy relief'. Too often films like this have at least one villainous character but this was improved by the fact that the characters motives were pure even if certain choices were wrong... those choices have to be made to give us the brainy sharks without which we wouldn't have the story. The special effects are impressive; especially the sharks but also various explosions and other moments of drama. The use of many physical effects, such as having the cast in real rough water helps the viewer believe what they are watching. Overall I enjoyed this more than expected and would definitely recommend it to fans of creature based horror.",Deep Blue Sea
7,BA_Harrison,"When will scientists learn? Tamper with nature, and soon enough it'll bite you in the ass.",9,26 February 2010,"It must be a real drag to not be able to watch a dumb, summer blockbuster without poring over the details of the plot, analysing the performances, and studying the special effects through the eyes of a Weta employee. I am just thankful that I can sit down and enjoy a film about over-sized, super-intelligent, man-eating sharks without worrying about insignificant things like character development, scientific accuracy, or whether a killer fish looks 100% real or not.If you are also able to divorce yourself from reality and enjoy a film as pure entertainment rather than a work of art, then Renny Harlin's Deep Blue Sea should prove to be the perfect way to spend an hour or two. The director who gave us excellent action-fests Die Hard 2, The Long Kiss Goodnight and Cliffhanger delivers yet another slam-bang, explosive and thrill-packed adventure that delivers top-quality excitement and effective scares from the get go.Set on a floating, mid-ocean research facility, the film revolves around the search for a cure for Alzheimer's using fluids extracted from the enlarged brains of genetically altered sharks. As is usually the case when scientists decide to meddle with nature, the s**t soon hits the fan: a series of disasters result in the scientists being trapped in the slowly flooding facility with their hungry scientific specimens for company. Cue lots of water, loads of screaming, and bodies being torn apart with ease by massive CGI sharks.As far as I am concerned, this film really delivers the goods: the cast are great, with Thomas Jane playing the hero with ease, Burrows' sexy scientist adding some T&A (giving us one hell of a gratuitous 'strip' scene), LL Cool J as the stereotypical comedy relief, and Samuel L. Jackson providing the film with the movie's standout scene, a motivational speech that doesn't quite have the desired effect; in addition, the action is slick, nail-biting, and perfectly executed by Harlin, and although not always perfectly rendered, the sharks are believable enough to be scary.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Deep Blue Sea
8,paul_haakonsen,Better than most shark movies at least...,6,17 June 2018,"While ""Deep Blue Sea"" is no Academy award-winning movie or a movie that revolutionized the shark movie genre, then it is still a rather enjoyable movie and it certainly beats most shark movies by a mile.There is an abundance of good action throughout the course of the movie, most of which is quite intense both is execution and presentation. There are plenty of moments that will have you up at the edge of your seat the first time you watch ""Deep Blue Sea"".""Deep Blue Sea"" has fairly great CGI effects for the most parts. The sharks look realistic and menacing, and that is a must for a movie in this killer shark genre. However, it looked rather fake when the sharks took Russell Franklin (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and Jim Whitlock (played by Stellan Skarsgård).They had an interesting and good cast ensemble to perform in the movie, which included Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgård and Michael Rapaport.All in all, ""Deep Blue Sea"" is a good shark movie, and one you definitely should take the time to watch if you enjoy shark movies and haven't already seen it. A friendly word of advise though, stay well clear of the sequel they made for it.",Deep Blue Sea
9,Quinoa1984,Thrilling,6,24 July 2000,"This film is thrilling, but it is not Jaws.  This film has a good plot to begin with (taking shark brain to cure alzheimer's), and some good thrills, I just felt un easy about the film.  I mean, I thought there were rules to the characters that die (spoil I won't) and don't.  Still, It's fun to watch LL Cool J, Samuel L. Jackson and Safrron Burrows trying to escape from a smart shark.  Never can be as good as Jaws though (so please don't say it is as good if not better than it).  Cool J performs the theme to the movie. B+",Deep Blue Sea
10,BandSAboutMovies,A surprise!,6,22 December 2018,"A lot of people talk down on Renny Harlin. But with his films - Prison, A Nightmare on Elm Street part 4: The Dream Master, Die Hard 2 and more - you know exactly what you're getting. A popcorn movie with no brain ready to entertain you until you can't take it any more.Witness his take on shark movies. He gets what works and then makes the movie fly so it doesn't feel like even half of its 1 hour, 45-minute length. This is lean, mean and ready to bite.Shot in the same tanks that James Cameron used for Titanic, the idea of this movie is absolutely ridiculous. In a deep sea facility, a team of scientists is using mako sharks to reactivate dead brain cells within patients with Alzheimer's disease. One of those sharks has already escaped and attacked a boat full of partying teens, so the company behind it all sends Russell Franklin (Samuel Jackson) to investigate.Doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock (Saffron Burrows and Stellan Skarsgård) prove their research to Franklin by removing protein complexes from the brain of their biggest shark. Bad idea - one shark is all it takes to mess everything up. It eats up Whitlock's arm and as he's being evacuated, inclement weather fouls up everything. His stretcher goes into the shark pen and as one of the sharks grabs it, it pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing anyone who could get the word out that things have gone wrong.Susan, Russell, shark wrangler Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), marine biologist Janice Higgins and engineer Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport) then watch a shark use that very same stretcher to smash its way into the lab, flooding the entire base. Susan then confesses that she and Jim had genetically engineered the brain size of the sharks, which let them harvest more protein. It also made them smarter and deadlier. This is why this movie is wonderful; dumb lapses in science and logic that are glossed over so that more people can be devoured by sharks.Meanwhile, cook Sherman ""Preacher"" Dudley (LL Cool J) may have lost his parrot to a shark and almost got cooked in an oven, but he knows the shark's natural movie predator: explosions. He blows one shark up real good and goes to find the rest of the crew.When we find the crew, they're arguing and Russell gives a speech about how everyone has to work together. In any other movie, this is where people would pull it through. Here, a shark emerges and decimates the executive. It's a moment that will make you stand up on your couch and scream your head off in glee.What I love about this one is that no one is safe. The people you expect to survive - and the ones you don't - get killed horribly. If you love watching sharks eat people, good news. This one has it all.There are a lot of cues to Jaws here: the license plate they find in a shark's mouth is the same as that movie. And the ways the three sharks are killed - blown up, electrocuted and incinerated - exactly play back the way the shark is killed in Jaws, Jaws 2 and Jaws 3D.You should totally check this one out. I was actually surprised by how much I loved it. That's after more than twenty shark movies in a few weeks, so that's really saying something.",Deep Blue Sea
11,michaelRokeefe,More chomp to the bite. Smarter sharks are deadlier!,6,28 January 2000,"One good thing said about this movie is the special effects. The scenes of human consumption were something to see. This thriller also had the old music rise and fall with each event. A scientist tampers with DNA in order to find a miracle drug. She ends up creating sharks that are much larger, hungrier and more aggressive.The acting was miserable. Thomas Jane was smug and plastic. Saffron Burrows was nice to look at, but did not fit the character she tried to play. The best lines in the movie came from rapper LL Cool J. Samuel L. Jackson was killed off too quick. Action and suspense prevail. If high anxiety is you thrill, start here.",Deep Blue Sea

13,Hey_Sweden,Solid entertainment.,8,17 March 2013,"Shark movies may be a dime a dozen, but that doesn't mean that some of them don't provide some very agreeable diversion. ""Deep Blue Sea"" may follow a formula, to be sure, but it manages to be tense and exciting at many times.Much credit should go to director Renny Harlin, an under-rated expert at this sort of big scale action for many years. Here Harlin keeps the movie moving forward more than adequately, and manages to get us on the edges of our seats.The premise, admittedly, seems rather far fetched, as scientists working on a floating aquatic base are desperate to find the cure for Alzheimers', and experiment by utilizing a trio of sharks and their brain pans. Naturally, things start to go very wrong, as the sharks turn out to be much smarter than anybody anticipated. Also quite naturally, the crew has to deal with the fact that their base is slowly destructing, the result of the sharks' neat handiwork.Most of the cast plays this admirably straight, except for LL Cool J as the religious cook with the annoying pet parrot. The movie is already silly enough to not need this sort of thing. Thomas Jane is an effectively low key hero, while the rest of the cast - Saffon Burrows, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, and the almighty Samuel L. Jackson - all create some memorable characters. Jackson figures in the movies' gut-busting highlight sequence; you'll know it when you see it.The production design (by Joseph Bennett and William Sandell) is particularly impressive in terms of the technical side of the film. The movie alternates between use of animatronics and CGI sharks; the effects range from passable to just plain hilarious. Some of the deaths are clearly meant to be shocking, and they would be more so if the effects were better.The movie starts off with a bang - in a familiar enough manner, it involves two horny couples relaxing on a boat in the open ocean - and maintains a good level of intensity for as long as it lasts. The laughs to be had from watching it just make it that much more enjoyable.Ronny Cox appears uncredited; look also for Harlin in a brief bit.Eight out of 10.",Deep Blue Sea
14,CinemaSerf,The fishes fight back...,5,19 June 2020,"The science behind this may well be plausible - that cures for human ailments may well rest elsewhere in the animal kingdom. To that end Saffron Burrows (""Susan"") enlists the help of millionaire philanthropist ""Russell Franklin"" (Samuel L. Jackson) to develop a cure for Alzheimer's using sharks captive in a converted offshore submarine refuelling base. When he arrives at the facility he meets the rather oddball crew including ""Carter"" (Thomas Jane"") ""Preacher"" (LL Cool J) and ""Jim"" (Stellan Skarsgård) before quickly discovering that these genetically altered fish are tired of being the guinea-pigs in the lab and are bent on revenge. The film does not hang about; the effects are quite scary at times but the one great snag is given that the sharks are supposed to be super-intelligent: why did they agree to star in a film with the dreadfully flat Burrows - there are bits of flotsam in this film less wooden than her performance. Jane & LL Cool J have some fun as they try to evade their menacing foes and though it certainly isn't ""Jaws""; it's not terrible...",Deep Blue Sea
15,poolandrews,Highly enjoyable 'Creature Feature'.,7,11 March 2010,"Deep Blue Sea starts as our teenagers are attacked in a catamaran by a huge genetically modified Mako Shark after it escapes from it's enclosure at the Aquatica research laboratory. Fearing bad publicity investors demand head scientist Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) justify her research, rich businessman Russell Franklin (Samual L. Jackson) flies to the Ocean bound laboratory & witnesses the research for himself as Susan is close to developing a formula that could eradicate degenerative brain disease like alzheimer's using extracts of protein from the enhanced Shark's brains. However to harvest enough protein the team have genetically altered the Shark's brains making them five times their normal size & as a side effect making the Shark's much smarter. The Shark's organise an ambush & manage to start flooding the Aquatica letting them swim inside, the team inside quickly realise the Shark's want to kill & eat them & somehow must find a way to to get to the surface...This American Australian co-production was directed by Rennt Harlin & is probably the best Shark based 'Creature Feature' out there (Jaws (1975) doesn't count as a mere creature feature as it's so much more) & the type of film the Sci-Fi Channel can only dream of making, Deep Blue is a real guilty pleasure of mine & I have throughly enjoyed it every time I have watched it. There's nothing deep or meaningful here & it has it's silly moments but as a blockbusting piece of entertainment you can't go wrong. At just over 100 minutes it's fast moving, there are a couple of surprise moments as character's you don't expect to get killed off, there's plenty of set-pieces as the intelligent Shark's lay traps for & chase people, there's action, some thrills, some suspense, some horror & gore, some neat effects & a fairly satisfying outcome. As a whole Deep Blue Sea works very well although it has it's silly moments like the cook trapped in an oven in a flooded kitchen & the Shark somehow turns the cooker on & while cutting his way out with an axe he doesn't even create a single spark as that would have blown him up, then there's the scene in which a scientist puts some Shark brain protein on dead human brain tissue & it 'sparks' back to life which is just plain ridiculous but these are small quibbles & it's very easy to go with the film & enjoy it for what it is. The character's are pretty good with Burrows scientist in particular coming across well, the dialogue is fine & easy to follow, the Shark's come across as clever but not too clever which gives them a nice edge & it's just a really great horror thriller with Shark's, in fact you could say Deep Blue Sea is a cross between Jaws & Alien (1979) with Shark's replacing the alien as they hunt down corridors.Some really good big budget monster films came out in 1999 including this, The Mummy (1999) & Lake Placid (1999) & Deep Blue Sea is as good as any of them in my opinion. There's a wholly exploitative scene where Saffron Burrows takes her wet-suit off to reveal her panties & bra in order to insulate herself against an electric shock which stands-out as being odd (if a giant Shark is attacking you would you take your clothes off?) but still much appreciated by those who are fans of a fine female body. There are a few nice touches & gags for horror fans including the license plate pulled from the Shark's teeth in this is the same as the one found inside the Shark in the original Jaws while the three Shark's in Deep Blue Sea are killed in the same way & in the same order (first one is blown up like in Jaws, second one is electrocuted like in Jaws 2 (1979) & the third is blown up like in Jaws 3-D (1983)) as in the first three Jaws films. There's some decent gore including ripped in half bodies, a bitten off arm & some blood splatter. Surprisingly I personally think that there's some nice tension, some surprises & a bit of suspense too, I mean it's not amazing but at least it's not dull & I think it manages to evoke a few emotions from the viewer.With a supposed budget of about $78,000,000 this did alright at the box-office, the production values are high & the CGI effects are mostly very good although it is a very wet film with water in virtually every scene. Shot mainly in Mexico. The acting is pretty good from a decent cast, Saffron Burrows is good & she looks great too, Thomas Jane is alright while even LL Cool J doesn't irritate like I thought he would while Samual L. Jackson is always watchable in this sort film.Deep Blue Sea is the best Shark themed 'Creature Feature' out there bar none, I throughly enjoyed it from start to finish, sure it's not deep & it has it's silly moments but the positives far outweigh the negatives which are more minor quibbles than full blown criticisms. I definitely recommend this to any creature feature fans, fans of killer Shark films or anyone just wanting a fast paced horror thriller.",Deep Blue Sea
16,Bunuel1976,"DEEP BLUE SEA (Renny Harlin, 1999) **",4,22 October 2006,"Moronic hi-tech sci-fi/horror film for the popcorn crowd with a trio of monsters in the form of very bad CGI sharks: JAWS (1975) it ain't and, in fact, the film succeeds better as a disaster movie - with the elaborately-designed undersea facility submerged in a spectacularly over-the-top explosion, and with the occupants having to swim to the surface amid the ruins and the marauding (and revenge-seeking) maneaters; apparently, their brain cells offer a cure for Alzheimer's and, so, ruthless doc Saffron Burrows argues that if their brain cells are genetically augmented, the eventual cure would be that much more effective...with the unfortunate side-effect being that the sharks are now capable of thought!! Again, the film is merely a B-picture type of plot brought up to date and given a glossy surface - but it's fun in the way that dreck like the Friday THE 13TH saga never is to me! As a matter of fact, the more the film took itself seriously (i.e. the thinner the cast list grew) the more hilarious it became - from the moment Samuel L. Jackson is delivering an impassioned speech about the vital need for the group to remain united if they are to survive (he has just come from a similar tension-filled 'hopeless situation' incident on the Alps, so the guy knows what he's talking about), only to have a shark jump out of the water, grab him and go down again, I couldn't contain my laughter (actually, all the various death scenes were howlers)! It is when the film does try to be funny - courtesy of a fat Latino telephone operator or a foul-mouthed parrot - that it fails and Stellan Skarsgaard (as the head doc) looks pretty bored. The scene where a shark turns on the submerged oven to roast the colored chef taking refuge within has to be seen to be believed, though...",Deep Blue Sea
17,grantss,Silly but strangely compelling,6,12 August 2018,"In a floating research facility, scientists are exploring a possible cure for Alzheimer's Disease. This involves genetically modifying the brains of Mako sharks, making them super-intelligent, and much larger than normal. There are three of these sharks at the facility. Then, after a freak accident, the sharks escape. Worse still, the facility is sinking...Mostly your average creature-horror movie, which is not a good thing. Plot is pretty basic: pretty standard setup for disaster, one-dimensional, cartoonish characters and some incredibly cheesy dialogue (LL Cool J gets the worst of it, with some ridiculous lines).So, on the surface, nothing going for it. Yet, the story is strangely compelling. The reason for this the unpredictability of it. You can usually judge who the heroes are going to be by who among the actors has a bigger name. This movie breaks that formula, killing off people you thought would last to the final scene. Some great red herrings. Makes for some wonderfully unexpected moments.Also means that it is not a given that there is going to be a happy ending, making it more interesting.So, better than your average creature-horror, though not that this says much.",Deep Blue Sea

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Yet another modern B-movie,5,21 November 2004,"You have to wonder; when exactly did Hollywood stop caring about quality? Did they ever care? This movie is yet another one of these new B-movies, just like Deep Rising and other recent movies which I have avoided due to my lack of tolerance for them. A B-movie can be fun, campy, corny enough to be entertaining... but the new ones aren't that. They're just bad, pure and simple. This film really doesn't have anything at all going for it... except for maybe the big names in the cast. The plot is ludicrous... the writers probably didn't even consider making it plausible... at all. Breeding super-intelligent sharks in order to cure Alzheimer's disease? Oh, come on. The pacing is awful, the movie is very, very hard to sit through. The characters are poorly written stereotypes and clichés. The acting is mostly mediocre, but a few performances go even lower and almost hit rock bottom. The special effects are laughable. They're among the worst I've ever seen... and that says quite a lot, believe me. The sharks aren't the least bit scary... I was never scared of them. They look so terribly fake. The film tries to be original by never really killing anyone when we expect them to die... every time someone looks like they're about to die, they survive. If everything is quiet... expect someone to die. Once, they even went to the trouble of having a character go into a deep, meaningful monologue just to set up a giant shock for the audience... which is all the movie is about, anyway. Shocking the audience. If you ask Renny Harlin what he wanted to achieve through this film, I'm sure his answer would be ""to scare people"". That's it. No message, no symbolism. Just a bunch of scares in an empty movie. The worst thing about it is, we know exactly who's going to die. We may even know the order, if 'we' pay attention(mind you, I did no such thing for at least 95% of the movie, if you add up how many seconds I payed attention versus how long the movie was) which leaves only one question; *when* they're going to die. Now, if you think that is enough reason to sit through about 105 minutes of pointless B-movie crap, then this movie is for you. If not, avoid this like the plague. My high rating for this movie must be due to my being in a very good mood today... or maybe I just found laughing at the movie made it deserve more than a 1. Who knows. I recommend this only to fans of new B-movies and possibly fans of the various actors... I would recommend it to fans of director Renny Harlin, but I doubt that they exist. Approach with caution... or a lighthearted attitude and too much free time. 5/10",Deep Blue Sea
20,view_and_review,DBS Giveth and DBS Taketh Away,6,16 December 2020,"This movie had a lot going for it: the cast, the budget, the plot, and some sick death scenes. What's not to like about some overgrown, super-intelligent sharks with a bloodlust? That was all cool except for a couple of inexcusable flaws.Chimera Pharmaceuticals was funding an expensive research and development project for a cure for Alzheimer's. To develop this cure the scientists needed a certain chemical from a shark's brain. To get more of this chemical the scientists gave the sharks hormones to make them bigger. The truth is, they did more than that and they got extra large, extra smart, homicidal fish.But even an extra large, extra smart, homicidal fish needs theatrical help, and that's where I get off the ride. I know it's useless to point out plot holes in horror movies because very few horror movies could even exist without plot holes. That doesn't mean I have to ignore them and it doesn't mean I have to be OK with them.The two biggest issues with ""Deep Blue Sea"" were A.) the poor construction of their ocean facility and B.) the ever altering size of the sharks.You'd figure that a multimillion dollar, middle of the ocean, research lab would be robust and resilient. It is in the middle of the ocean after all. Yet, the entire facility was compromised by a helicopter accident.First of all, the helicopter had no business flying with the weather conditions as they were. Second of all, even if the helicopter crashed into the facility it wouldn't have set off a chain reaction of explosions so catastrophic that the entire structure was damaged to some degree. This structure has to hold back millions of gallons of water and withstand hurricanes/typhoons, so a helicopter crash should've been a minor setback.Furthermore, their main underwater panoramic window was cracked by a gurney that hit it at about 30 mph. Again, this facility has to hold up to the pressure of millions of gallons of water. Someone should be able to fire a bullet into the glass and not crack it, so what more about a gurney being tossed into it?As for the sharks and their ability to shrink and grow; it was irksome. They were super large when it suited the plot and they were baby shark size when it suited the plot. One minute they are so big that they bring down a helicopter and bite other sharks in half, the next minute they can fit through doorways and narrow corridors. It made no sense. At the very least it was a massive oversight, and at worst it was stark stupidity.Now, with those two impossible-to-overlook issues (shoddy building and size-shifting sharks), this movie still was kinda cool. No one was safe and I liked that. Samuel L. Jackson got bit in half mid speech! They didn't even give us a female survivor which is scary movie law!! ""Deep Blue Sea"" gave us some maddening stuff while giving us some cool stuff too. For a horror movie that's alright.",Deep Blue Sea

Jackson) to their ocean laboratory to witness the progress their entire team has accomplished. Essentially, what they have done is to inject certain chemicals into the brains of three large mako sharks and then to extract the substance produced during the biological reaction. In the process however the three sharks have grown incredibly intelligent-yet they still possess their killer instinct. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a passable ""shark movie"" for the most part. Quite frankly, the plot was rather standard and as a result some of the scenes seemed to lack suspense. Likewise, I also didn't particularly care for the death of one of the key characters at the end. Be that as it may while it wasn't necessarily a bad movie overall I thought it could have used a bit more excitement and as a result I rate it as slightly below average.",Deep Blue Sea

Cool J, Michael Rapaport: Cheap shark thriller that specializes in extreme crap. It is certainly no Jaws. An experiment is conducted on sharks that expands their brain mass but that only opens for opportunity for the sharks to turn on people and have lunch. Why any idiot would agree to an experiment of this nature is beyond normal understanding but much of the film delivers its real purpose, which is to showcase pointless scenes of sharks tearing people to shreds. Special effects are good but story is dimwitted. Director Renny Harlin seems more interested in production than a story but he is skilled at delivering action. He previously made Cliffhanger and Cutthroat Island. Among the wasted talent are Thomas Jane, Saffron Burrows, Samuel L. Jackson, and L.L. Cool J and not one of them delivers a performance worth showing up on set for. In fact Jackson in particular was a huge waste after his spotlight in films better than this. They are basically fish bait with none of the care that the cast of Jaws received that allowed that film to be involving and frightening. It could have been an interesting and intense thriller about tampering with nature but the only thing tampered with is the screenplay in the wrong hands. It is a dreadful and graphic mess that should be fed to sharks. Score: 2 / 10",Deep Blue Sea
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Really good if you ignore the connections,7,16 June 2011,"Working on a cure for Alzheimer's, the crew of an underwater exploration facility learns the genetically-enhanced sharks used as lab-rats in the experiments have gained super-intelligence through the tests and are hunting them down one at a time after escaping capture as they try to escape.While this isn't without its flaws there's certainly a fun time to be had. Among the film's best assets is that this one manages to generate an effective setup for its sharks which turns it into a pretty enjoyable piece. The fact that this is probably at it's best as it works the unique killer-shark-on-the-rampage scenario that has been developed, making full use of the facility and its surroundings to concoct a series of chilling, suspense-filled chase scenes that are just plain fun. The attack on the facility itself, from the attack at the helicopter to the destruction of the panel carrying the victim is a series of rather fun and impressive action scenes that are just an absolute blast making these parts the film's true highlights. That allows the rest of the film to entertain a series of fun stalking scenes getting the sharks into some rather fun moments. The initial strike with the shark roaring to life on the operating table is a classic shock jump, while the extended battle in the kitchen offers up some intriguing moments with the creature taking on plenty of fun slasher villain tactics to get at their prey. That sets the stage for the other big attacks which are perhaps some of the best examples of this feeling, with the big confrontation in the elevator shaft as well as the later scene inside the flooded facility and eventual escape, to the action at the end inside the compound which are a blast and uses that kind of action to give this a nice finish. As these are often punctuated with some fantastic gore in a series of brutal kills that come off as impressive no matter how seemingly unrealistic they would be, these hold the film up over its main flaws. The film's biggest blunder that's nearly impossible to ignore is just how inane the whole plot itself really is. There's almost nothing here to suggest this is in anyway rational, from the methods of experimentation which is completely wrong and ludicrous how they try to implement the various scientific techniques and procedures which are incorporated throughout here. That is just a large part of what holds it back since it spends so much time trying to hammer home the science of the processes of conducting the research as well as just about every piece about the operation within, which are far from realistic and just tend to become aggravating after a while due to the sheer logistical difficulties in examining how it's gone. Even the sharks look bad, the apparent CGI being all the more obvious in scenes where the behavior is so uncharacteristic that it becomes striking after a while. Overall, this is a fun film if you can ignore the rationale of it all.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Deep Blue Sea

What's supposed to be a visit for Russell Franklin turns into something more, when the sharks flood the facility and hunt down the team, and thanks to the team, the sharks are now smarter than ever.....Seeing this for the first time in sixteen years makes you realise that if it wasn't for L.L Cool J's screamingly over the top performance as the religious cook, and the most amazing death scene ever in a film, this film is a pretty turgid affair, and just proves what a hack Harlin became after Stallone climbed a mountain.The director still makes just about watchable films, but when you compare his work now,to that of Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, and even The Long Kiss Goodnight, he has fallen a great height from his hey day.And while this has a wonderful, high, over the top concept, it's really unbelievable at just how dull the film can be at times.And this is due to the way the characters just seem so one dimensional, and are just a stereotype of what they do for a living.L.L aside, we have shouty Jackson, because this is what he was famous for at that time in his career, thanks to a certain bible verse, Skarsgaard plays the couldn't give an eff scientist. And why couldn't he? Why, he's the most brilliant scientist in the world, so fair dues.Jane plays the brooding hero, and Burrows? Well she's the English character in the film, so she ends up as the villain of the whole piece, and is as dull as ditchwater compared to the rest of the cast.So who comes out unscathed by the film? Good old Ronny Cox, because he knows when to keep his mouth shut.So as soon as we reach the complex, which has more windows than a PC, it's a case of who will get killed next, and how.It's devoid of any tension, the effects are extremely bad in certain parts, and it all ends as you'd expect, suddenly and boring.If you haven't seen this, ignore the reviews saying its much better than Jaws, that's delusional.

Don't get me wrong, it was a pretty good movie as long as you didn't take it to seriously, but I would have preferred more attacks in the open sea.  What we get are most of the attacks happening in a research facility.  Scientist are experimenting on sharks, looking for a cure to Alzheimer's, the sharks that are super intelligent strike back.  The facility is basically floating, and the sharks bust a window and the facility starts to flood and then starts to sink and the sharks get in.  Some good shark attacks follow...and you get to hear a very great speech by Samuel L. Jackson that is really inspiring.  Of course, if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about.  In the end this isn't the type of movie you watch for the great acting, but for the wild action and shark attacks.  In this one we get I think it was three sharks, two rather little ones and one big one.

27,MovieAddict2016,It ain't too deep...,1,20 February 2004,"I saw this movie in 2001 and hated. Then I saw it again last night and I now hate it even more.So I tried to think of the absolute wackiest idea for a review, and I came up with this:A Conversation with the Shark from ""JAWS"" (1975).Not many people know this, but those sharks from the ""JAWS"" movies weren't real. Oh, no, they were actually animatronic machines--so when that Great White stood up on its tail in ""Jaws the Revenge,"" it wasn't real--it was a machine. Who would have guessed it? From such authentic realism, the first thing I said after watching that movie was, ""How'd they get the shark to do that?""Yes, I was too foolish to realize that the animatronic puppet from ""JAWS"" was fake. I thought it was real. So, despite all my friends trying to persuade me from doing so, I laboriously researched hours on end, pouring over encyclopedias and the Internet, searching for ways to train a Great White Shark to stand on its dorsal fin and crash its stomach into a boat. Alas, there were no reasonable results--the closest I came to figuring out how they did it was this quote from Steven Spielberg: ""I had nothing to do with this movie. Leave me alone.""This led me into the dangerous underworld of stalking--first I stalked the director, then the writers and producers, then the chairman of Universal and all people that worked within fifty miles of the filming for ""Jaws the Revenge"" (I was only slapped with fifteen restraining orders!). My answers will still...uh...unanswered.And I was still haunted by the terrifying climactic showdown between Ellen Brody and the shark. I knew that my mind would not be clear unless I went straight to the person responsible for the stunt: the shark himself. (This is when I found out for the first time that an animatronic puppet did it, and I cursed the world for tricking me once again. I raised my fist high into the air and shouted, ""It was fake! Curse them for making me believe otherwise!"")But one of these sharks from the original ""JAWS"" was indeed a real fish, used in some underwater shots during the movie, particularly that of the Great White attacking Hooper's cage and various other ""faraway"" shots. I got to have a brief chat with this shark as part of his promotion for his new movie, ""Free Willy Goes to Hell: The Final Willy,"" in which Gordo the Shark makes a brief cameo appearance during a scene where Free Willy and his new friend are eaten alive by a pack of hungry sharks.I was immediately taken aback by Gordo the Shark's giant size. He could barely fit in his water tank from where I sat fifty yards away with a jumbo-sized microphone equivalent to those giant Slurpee cups you get at 7-11. After the preliminary introductions we got straight to the point (note: I had to interpret most of the clicking and clacking noises he made in response to my questions, but I translated as best as I could, and I honestly believe that this is what he said):JU: How have you found your career so far?G: Moonbesck.(I interpret this as shark talk for, ""Very good."")JU: How was it working with Steven Spielberg on ""JAWS""?G: Moonbesck.(I interpret this as, ""He was an egotistical maniac."")JU: What did you think of Renny Harlin's major knock-off, ""Deep Blue Sea""?G: Moonbesck. (I interpret this as, ""It sucked big time."")At this point in the interview, Gordo the Shark attempted to break free from his containment and devour the entire studio where the interview was being conducted. I managed to escape unscathed with only a few missing limbs.With blood pouring everywhere and major veins torn open, I decided to use the remaining moments of my life to write a review of ""Deep Blue Sea,"" one of the worst shark attack films of all time--perhaps even worse than ""Shark Attack"" itself (but that's pushing it). Forget the stupid stereotypical characters, exceedingly ridiculous dialogue, dumb ideas and idiotic ""in-joke"" references to Renny's other films (how many references to ""Die Hard 2"" did I count? I wish I had written down all of them), this film just doesn't stay afloat. It's a big, boring B-movie with a large budget that still manages to have some of the worst special effects of all time. This stuff was done eight years prior in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day.""Take Gordo's advice and skip this one. It ain't too deep.",Deep Blue Sea
28,sddavis63,Flawed Movie Proves That Intelligence Isn't Everything,4,23 April 2001,"Lacklustre performances, second-rate special effects and predictable blood-letting spoils a movie whose plot had some potential.Saffron Burrows stars as Dr. Susan McAlester, a research scientist searching for a cure for Alzheimer's Disease through research on shark brains. Needing increasing amounts of brain tissue, McAlester's team decides to break the rules governing their scientific research by genetically altering the sharks to increase their brain size, which then results in an unfortunate increase in the sharks' intelligence.I have to admit that, given what the scientists needed (more shark brain tissue), I never really understood why they would choose to do it by using genetic modification on the sharks they had (which sounds to my admittedly unscientific mind to be a rather complicated and somewhat long-term business) rather than simply going out and getting more sharks. I concede that shark-hunting must be a dangerous business, but it sounds to me as if it would be simpler and quicker, and Carter Blake (played by Thomas Jane) seems to be pretty good at it. I'm also not sure that simply increasing the size of the sharks' brains would lead to them becoming more intelligent? But, setting what I consider those obvious plot oversights aside, I just didn't think the movie was that good. A helicopter crash sets off an interminable series of explosions and other disasters that seem to go on and on before any of the story picks up again. I mean, we get the point. The helicopter crashed, and badly damaged ""Aquatica"" - the ocean-based laboratory. But you'd think the world was coming to an end the way this series of disasters went on and on.Once that has passed, there's some decent enough action as the sharks hunt their captors, but the acting is quite flawed. Obviously artificial screams of terror are followed within seconds by completely normal interaction between the characters as though they didn't just see their friend get torn in pieces by this shark. These folks have a fast recovery time from trauma! I was also intrigued by the fact that the genetic modifications that changed the sharks' brain size also results in sharks that look suspiciously like little orcas! I've seen pictures of sharks and orcas. They have different markings; different colours! You wouldn't know that from this movie. The scenes involving shark attacks also looked quite phony to me.I was going to give this a 2 or 3, until the very end, when the ironic twist of the movie became apparent to me, and since I didn't see it coming I have to raise this to a 4.**SPOILER AHEAD**I found it an interesting example of poetic justice that in the end, the only survivors of this disaster were the two characters (Preacher the cook, played by LL Cool J, and the shark hunter Carter Blake) who had no real education!

43,Anonymous_Maxine,Bitterly disappointing.,5,2 August 2001,"A film with a premise like Deep Blue Sea had has a tremendous amount of potential. There is so much that you can do with super-intelligent sharks, but this just comes off as a pretentious mess that ignores its possibilities. Obviously, the biggest challenge for a film like this is to come up with a satisfactory explanation for why some scientists with an assumingly high degree of intelligence would take it upon themselves to choose sharks as the animals whose brains they would like to stimulate and augment. Sure, it's pretty clever that someone has figured that there is a way to use the brain tissue of sharks in order to cure Alzheimer's disease, but there's not a lot of mystery about the choice to use sharks, at least from the point of view of the writer's desk. So they increase the size of the sharks' brains five fold, and a similar increase of intelligence follows. There are, however, several instances of an increase of knowledge that seem to come as an automatic result of increased intelligence (the scene where the shark sets the oven to 500 degrees after LL Cool J flees into it comes to mind), which really makes no sense. And this is not even to mention the laughable increase in physical abilities, such as the suddenly obtained ability to swim backwards.The first thing that really becomes noticeable is the horrendous special effects throughout. It's bad enough that a shark at one point holds a man in a stretcher in its teeth and literally throws him at an underwater plate glass window - which would be physically impossible if only because of the viscosity of the seawater  now we have to watch a movie with sharks that perform impossible acts and looks like cartoons. Some huge corporation has funded this research on a self-contained research vessel at sea, and when dealing with super intelligent sharks, it's obvious that something is going to go wrong. And sure enough, lots of stuff goes wrong, but unfortunately, nothing goes wrong that you wouldn't really expect to see go wrong in a movie like this. (spoilers) In the film's defense, there are at least one or two moments of genuine excitement, such as Samuel L. Jackson's untimely and shocking demise. What a great scene that was. On the other hand, this is comparable to the fireplace scene in The Haunting, the hugely disappointing 1999 semi-horror film. It was a great scene that just about lifts you off your seat, but the film as a whole is a big disappointment. LL Cool J plays the part of the religious cook on the vessel, providing us with the comic relief and the recipe for the perfect omelet, spoken as his last words, his legacy, if you will (`Many people add milk to their eggs to increase density, this is a mistake!'). Thanks for the wisdom there, LL. On the other hand, without the boneheaded dialogue, the weak story, the scripted and ineffectual action sequences, and the terrible special effects, this wouldn't be a summer blockbuster at all, but a memorable film, like Jaws. Deep Blue Sea has a lot in common with its backwoods, lake-set counterpart, Lake Placid, mostly in that they both retained a similar degree of let-down. However, there is a time for films like these. It's those times when you want to watch something light, but don't want to be bored by a romantic comedy. If you want to see a fairly fast paced thriller without having to think, Deep Blue Sea may very well be a good choice for you. But when you see the ludicrous ending, remember that you brought this upon yourself.",Deep Blue Sea

These sharks that are housed there, are super smart, and at Aquatica, a sea based plant in the middle of the ocean, it's boss, the impressive Burrows and her team are about to learn that. From the word ""Go"", we're in for an exciting ride, yet no thanks to not the best of scripts. DBS is blood thirstily shocking too, arms, legs, what have you, gone in the beat of a crunch. That's what's great about, it, if sometimes over the top. Check out Rappaports demise, the shark going through him in seconds, until he's a skeleton. When things get drastic here, Rapaport doesn't adhere to Burrow's orders, where she's the one pulling the strings, owning them like cattle, where as I remember, like Maximum Overdrive, some of the employees had criminal or probationary records like Rappaport and Jane. DBS is just a bloody good terror driven thrill ride, an excuse to kill off some time of reality, and head to the big screen.

I liked the scene where Dr. McCallister took off her wetsuit, stands on it, and gave the shark ""a shock of its life"". With the other survivors remaining, they had to put their trust into the Preacher. The cast chosen for this movie are great. Even though, Samuel L.

Yeah right !!! First scene where a catamaran gets torn apart by a shark - Yeah, right !!!I know something about modern catamarans. It takes lot more than some strong teeth to tear it apart, and people won't get shaken off its deck in a single jolt from a shark. Now I don't know how strong an underwater rig that's made out of steel or whatever its made out of, but noway, it's going to get sunk by a helicopter crash.

48,dfranzen70,"Hello, Cliche City!",4,24 December 1999,"With this script, it's almost as if someone went to a computer and said, ""Give me a list of all the cliches we've ever used in Hollywood,"" then used every one of them in this tepid dreck. Let's see, we have a genetic experiment gone wrong (as scientists use mako sharks to try to cure Alzheimer's), we have people isolated in the middle of the ocean, we have a romance that seems to be thrown in for no good reason, and we have an angry, emotionless enemy.Samuel Jackson plays the financier of these experiments, and naturally he has to fly in to check out his investment (shades of Jurassic Park). It isn't long before everyone about discovers that the sharks are.. well.. smarter than they've ever been. Of course, to be smarter than the people on this atoll is not a difficult feat, but at least the characters appear to be smarter than the screenwriters!Well, you can pretty much figure out what happens next, can't you? The sharks get out of hand, Man is taught a Very Big Lesson about meddling with things he shouldn't, and whoever survives hopes the movie grosses enough to warrant a sequel. Won't happen, kids. There was a distinct reason this tanked at the box office: it stunk. Hey, the effects are good, but they were a lot better in ""The Abyss.""

The storyline follows a lab based on the ocean that is visited by its primary investor. The lab houses various sharks being infused with proteins that can be harvested for various regenerative properties...it also makes them super smart and gives them traits no shark has. What could go wrong? This movie is directed by Renny Harlin (Driven) and stars Thomas Jane (The Mist), Saffron Burrows (Troy), LL Cool J (In Too Deep), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Michael Rapaport (True Romance) and Stellan Skarsgård (Good Will Hunting). I remember when this came out I really liked it...watching it again I can't remember why. The cast is really good and has some good lines, but Jane being a better swimmer than a shark? The scientists being so nonchalant around the sharks? The super powered sharks doing so many super shark type things?

50,PWNYCNY,Respect the Shark.,7,11 August 2005,"This is an intense and exciting science fiction movie, with an interesting story. Also, the movie is well-acted, especially by LL Cool J, who makes this movie work through a great performance. Further, the movie has a useful message - not to tamper with nature and to respect the creatures who inhabit the planet with us. The shark is a fascinating but dangerous creature, to be admired - from a distance - and be respected too. When unprovoked, the shark is, well, a shark. But when man invades its habitat, then the shark reacts and conflict ensues. This movie does not improve the reputation of the shark, and in fact exploits our fear of sharks. For sharks are one of those creatures that defy man's attempts to control it, which is what this movie is about. Scientists want to study the shark, but the sharks refuse to cooperate. Shark enthusiasts may object to the way sharks are vilified in this movie. But no matter how you feel about sharks, the message of this movie is apparent - sharks are dangerous, should be respected and should be left alone.",Deep Blue Sea
51,jimbo-53-186511,"The more I thought about it, the more I hated this film",4,27 February 2015,"If there's one thing I hate most about films it's films that are pretentious; this film starts out as a serious and potentially thought-provoking film about the use of sharks in order to research a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The film switches tone about half hour in and then ends up becoming a cross between Jaws and The Poseidon Adventure.The problem with this film is that the whole Alzheimer's research with the sharks seemed to merely be a plot device to create what was to follow. I believe that the only reason that the writers set the narrative up in this way was to stop people claiming that it's a shameful rip-off of Jaws and The Poseidon Adventure. If the 'scientific' aspect had been fleshed out more then the writers may have been able to argue this point, but the problem is that this aspect is glossed over and I felt that the writers rushed through it in order to get to the more exciting parts. There's no problem with this per se, but I felt that the writers should have either made a serious film focusing on finding a cure for Alzheimer's for humans by experimenting on sharks or just do a shameless B Movie style knock off of Jaws or The Poseidon Adventure. As it is this film tries to do both and that's what gave it a really pretentious feel to it.I also thought that the start of the film was quite stupid; what was the point of showing the red wine spill into the water and then show it as if it were blood? Was that supposed to be a parody of some sort? It certainly wouldn't have attracted the shark to the boat? Unless perhaps it was an alcoholic. Then the shark managed to smash through the underneath of the boat. Now I'm no boat expert, but surely the underside of the boat would be the strongest part of the boat so it's hard to believe that it could break through the underside of the boat. Yes they've got advanced intelligence, but where did they get their advanced strength from? There are other lapses in logic such as when the team conduct tests on one of the shark's brain and secure it with 2 pathetic looking harnesses whilst they drill into it's skull. Predictability shortly after the experiment has been completed successfully, the shark breaks free and kills one of the crew. It made me laugh that they would conduct this experiment when the shark was conscious. Surely it would have made more sense to tranquilise the shark and then carry out the test as drilling into the shark's skull would clearly antagonise it. Absolutely moronic.The sharks are billed as being super intelligent with super advanced brains yet the only smart thing that I saw any of the sharks do was to push one of the crew into the glass screen in order to break into Aquatica. The rest of the time the sharks just seem to catch the crew by chance and at every opportunity the sharks are killed easily. Where's the tension? Where's the suspense? The sharks were meant to be intelligent, but I didn't see much evidence of this.The sharks were also laughable and I'm unsure whether they were computer generated or animatronic, but either way they were awful. They didn't move like sharks - they twist and turn ridiculously quick and whilst I wouldn't go as far as to say that I laughed when they attacked anyone, these attacks certainly caused me to raise my eyebrows once or twice. The ending of the film was ridiculous and obvious and only made me even more angry and disappointed with this film.This film really should have either stuck with being a serious film exploring how to find a cure for Alzheimer's or it should have just been a Jaws/Poseidon Adventure knock off (had it been the latter it still wouldn't have been great, but at least it would have been honest). However, despite the fact that it is mildly entertaining it still angers me how pretentious and false the film feels.",Deep Blue Sea
52,barnabyrudge,"Exciting, but in a dumb way.",5,12 October 2005,"A very short summary of Deep Blue Sea might go something like: ""dumb plot, dumb dialogue, dumb characters, dumb situations, pretty good suspense"". And that would more-or-less be that. If you like being jolted out of your seat, this movie contains five or six moments that genuinely deliver. That said, if you like movies with a certain level of intelligence and credibility, you might just as well watch an episode of Road Runner (which would be twice as believable and ten times shorter!) It's a fair comment to say that Deep Blue Sea is the very epitome of the no-brainer popcorn flick.A team of scientists working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease have tampered with the genetics of Mako sharks in an effort to speed up their research. Team leader Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) is horrified to learn that her project is about to be shut down so, in an effort to buy more time, she invites one of the main financial backers, Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), to her oceanic research facility Aquatica to see for himself how close she is to a breakthrough. It quickly becomes apparent that Dr. McCallister's meddling has had an unusual effect upon the three Mako sharks at the facility. She herself admits that: ""as a side-effect, the sharks got smarter"". Before long, Franklin, Dr. McCallister and the rest of the research team - chef Sherman Dudley (LL Cool J), Jim Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgaard), diver Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), Tom Scoggins (Michael Rappaport) and Janice Higgins (Jacqueline Mackenzie) - find themselves being hunted by the three hyper-intelligent sharks. And, following an accident which submerges almost the entire research centre, their chances of survival look slim to say the least.... as the sharks smash into the place and glide ominously through the waterlogged corridors in search of human prey.Deep Blue Sea is a very contrived film. The script team of Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers and Wayne Powers have gone significantly out of their way to devise a sequence of events that manoeuvres the protagonists into danger. The problem is that the whole chain of incident that leads to the submergence of the research facility, and the extra threat posed by the sharks, is too artificially engineered and too low on credibility. No-one seriously buys the idea of accelerating a shark's brain power to cure Alzheimer's. No-one seriously buys the idea that the sharks would consequently develop a desire to kill victims in a pre-meditated manner. Yet the film asks us to take these plot developments oh-so-very seriously (or, at least, there's not enough evidence to suggest that a tongue-in-cheek approach is being employed). Performance-wise, the film asks little of its cast and that's exactly what they give it. There's a little macho posturing, and a few bravura speeches, and that is more-or-less it. The special effects vary in quality, with some good explosions and shark shots, while the actual shark attacks/killings look laughably fake. The one department where Deep Blue Sea IS effective is in its ability to generate sudden moments of shock. The death of one character after delivering a rousing heroic speech is particularly well-disguised (I'm not saying who, but I'll wager that it'll jolt you pretty good on your first viewing of the movie!) Throughout the film there are similar moments where suspense is nicely created and the pay-off - the scream-out-loud-moment - is well timed. Deep Blue Sea is good for a few scares, but fairly mediocre on other levels.",Deep Blue Sea

58,I_Ailurophile,"A little bit ridiculous, but a fairly good time",7,26 September 2021,"It's not just the prominent casting of Samuel L. Jackson - the first two scenes of the film, and the first sight of the facility, readily mirror 1993 blockbuster 'Jurassic Park.' Though sufficiently different overall, even Trevor Rabin's score immediately recalls John Williams' music for the dino classic. That familiarity is a consistent facet of 'Deep blue sea' in a number of story beats, but it's never so wholly a mimic as to spoil our entertainment. This isn't the most original or adeptly exciting action-adventure flick in the world, but it's a hearty bit of slightly silly fun that keeps us engaged.I love the set design. Immense care and presumably a fair bit of the budget went into building the research facility, Aquatica, and every bit of it looks great - the corridors, primary lab, comm tower, and exterior pens and safeguards, and more. Just as 'Jurassic Park' took some liberties with science to let dinosaurs live again, the screenwriters here played fast and loose with real research so the film's sharks could be hyperintelligent superthreats. But so it goes with action flicks - there are certain things the audience has to accept at face value, and as long as we can do that, then just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.Special effects look swell - fire, explosions, even the sharks - though some of the gore is noticeably over the top. There are some fine scenes arranged here, and I like the stuntwork. In general these roles aren't especially deep or dynamic, mostly filling certain archetypes to complete the cast of characters, but the screenplay gives the cast just enough room to inhabit the parts with a measure of range and nuance. With few exceptions, the dialogue is adequate and suitable, and that's about it. Surprisingly, it's the comic relief - LL Cool J, as the cook ""Preacher"" - who is the most well-rounded, yet also open-ended enough that the actor got to have a good time with it.Aside from echoing other blockbusters, there's some broad familiarity to the narrative that means little is particularly unexpected. Yet there's still a bit of cleverness on hand, and for whatever minor deficiencies there may be in the plot or in the movie as a whole, this is pretty enjoyable.It's not perfect, and it's not the most exquisitely thrilling action film out there, but this is a movie that only wants to entertain, and in that aim it succeeds. It's just unique enough from other genre titles that it stands out, and just good enough that it stands up.

60,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Popcorn Creature Feature,7,22 August 2019,"This was a film that I remember seeing when it first hit the movie channels. I used to watch it all of the time and to be honest, most of my non-horror friends dig it as well. It definitely is a popcorn flick where you can just turn it on at any time and just enjoy it from there. This is the first time that I had seen it in quite awhile though, so I was curious as to how well it would hold up. The synopsis is searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease; a group of scientists on an isolated research facility become the prey as trio of intelligent sharks fight back.We start this off with two couples partying on a boat. Something attacks them and we see it is a shark. As it goes to bite one of the members who fell into the water, it is shot with a harpoon. The person who shoots it is Carter Blake (Thomas Jane). He has to shoot it again after that.It then shifts to a fancy office where Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) is talking to Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson). He is one funding her research and we see that the headline is about a shark they were testing on got free. He informs her that they're going to be cutting the funding and she convinces him to come to the facility. She will show results over the weekend that will make up for the blunder and their stock prices will skyrocket.He agrees and in the helicopter to the remote facility, we learn that he survived an avalanche on the Alps. They arrive and he's introduced to a marine biologist, Janice Higgins (Jacqueline McKenzie). She shows him around and I think this is an interesting way to introduce us to the place as well, as he's never been there and wants to be treated like a tourist. Russell meets with Carter briefly and soon learns that he's not very talkative. We also meet Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport) who is running most of the computer equipment, Jim Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgård) whose a doctor helping Dr. McAlester as well as Preacher (LL Cool J) who is the cook.The goal is to show the experiments they are conducting on three of the sharks will cure degenerative brain diseases. It does work, but there is something that Dr. McAlester and Jim aren't sharing. Things take a turn when a strong tropical storm hits and Jim is bit. A helicopter comes to help crashes into the facility and the sharks run amuck. Russell wants to know how smart they are and learns a terrible truth about them. They wonder what the sharks are up to, but more important, they survivors are trying to make it to the surface before the facility floods and rests on the bottom of the ocean.I'm glad to kick off my analysis of the film stating that this one is still fun. I'm glad it's still enjoyable as an adult. I'm not saying that it's great, but it does hold up as a fun shark film. It actually has some really good writing though I noticed as well. There are a lot of things that are referenced at different points in the film that come back up later. I'm a sucker for this so I'm on-board.There is also some heart to this film. Dr. McAlester has a noble endeavor for the things that she does. There is a bit of unethical aspect to this that comes up later in the movie, but she is doing all of this because her father had Alzheimer's. It was difficult to work with him and she wants to prevent anyone else from going through that. I also really like the back-story to Russell, as it makes sense why he tries to inspire them like he does and that he has the will to survive as well.Creature features are a genre that I can get down with now and then as well. It is hard to make a shark movie, because Jaws was the first and probably still the best. This film though does do something different though. They are modified and are smarter, so they're able to do things that normal ones can't. I do find it odd they can swim backwards, as I know that is supposed to kill them. The movie even references it. That really isn't addressed here as to why they can, but I will let it slide.This film definitely is paced well as it really is one of those each event leads to the next one, so it really is a 'out of the frying pan, into the fire' type film. Because of that, it never gets boring to me. It also has a good running time, which definitely helps here as well. I think that the deaths we get are spaced out, so that really does help. The ending is something we don't see a lot of as well, which also works for me.The acting is something else that really helps the film as well. I feel that Jane some times gets a bad rap. I think here he is fine, he's just very quiet. That really is the character though, as he is a 'shark wrangler' and I get the vibe he's more comfortable being in the water with them like we see. He also has a criminal record so that plays in as well. Burrows I thought really had a bigger role, but she really doesn't. She comes off villainous in some of the reveals we get actually, but she is doing in for the greater good type thing. Jackson is solid and his demise is legendary now as it's been parodied since this film. It is fun to see Rapaport, LL Cool J and Skarsgård in their roles. I'd say they and the rest of the cast round out the film for what is needed.That moves me next to the effects, which was something I really worried about. To start with the positive, the animatronics shark, the blood and the practical effects are all solid. The real problem here is that the CGI really doesn't hold up for me. I get that these sharks are doing things that they couldn't get real ones to do and it would be impossible to do practical. It doesn't ruin the movie, but I just couldn't really tell. The film though is shot fine and I really like the underwater sequences we get.The last thing to cover is the soundtrack. For the most part it does fit the scenes and helps to build tension. It doesn't really stand out. The real reason I'm covering it here in this paragraph is that LL Cool J was actually the music supervisor and actually has two songs on the soundtrack. They're both pretty funny and I give him credit for it.Now with that said, this film isn't great so don't come in expecting a film that would rival Jaws as the best shark film of all time, but it is a lot of fun. It is one that you could definitely put on and have fun or watch with friends for sure. There is some really good writing with referencing things that come back up later and there is actually some heart with what they're doing. The idea of playing God is quite intriguing here. It is paced where it never gets bored and there really is tension to a solid conclusion. The acting is solid for this type of film. The practical effects are also pretty solid, but I'll be honest, most of the CGI really doesn't hold up. The soundtrack is fitting for what is needed and it is funny to see two songs that LL Cool J made just for this film. I can't rate it more than an above average film, but it is a fun popcorn film to revisit time to time for sure.",Deep Blue Sea
61,Spleen,`Jaws' is to `Deep Blue Sea' as `The Day of the Triffids' is to `Attack of the Killer Tomatoes',3,29 March 2000,"Take sharks.  Take everything that's frightening and poetic about sharks. Throw out the latter (but keep the sharks).  You have `Deep Blue Sea'.This point has been well made by others and I have no intention of belabouring it myself.  There are many other things for me to talk about. This is a deeply stupid movie: no one person can hope to cover the full extent of its stupidity.For a start, what's with the title?  It's clearly an allusion to the saying, `between the devil and the deep blue sea' - in case you thought otherwise, a surviving character (more about HIM later) murmurs `It's the devil ...' under his breath just after someone else has used the phrase `deep blue sea', but none of this explains how the old English saw is in any way an apt description of anything we see on screen.  I don't believe the writers knew what they were talking about.But here's the meaty bit, where I reveal stuff about who lives and who dies. Stop reading, if you wish.The most OFFENSIVE, if not the stupidest, thing about the film, is its moral attitude towards Saffron Burrows's character.  I was certain that as punishment for defying God by finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, she would die - and I was right.  She isn't even allowed to die in peace.  The writers, the other characters, the sharks, the very furniture, must bathe her in moral disapproval first.  At one point she risks her life in order to retrieve her cure for Alzheimer's; she isn't allowed to succeed and her calculated risk is presented as obsessive madness.  Yet in the end she is required to lay down her life so that a single, comparatively harmless shark doesn't escape into the ocean .  The writers clearly think THIS is a noble sacrifice, presumably because it's the kind of thing that the obsessively violent, God-fearing idiots that the script beams upon, would have done. (When she mutters under her breath that the shark must be stopped, her friend Rambo the Shark Wrestler says, `That's the first intelligent thing you've said all day.'  She ought to have retorted, `Then it's also the first intelligent thing ANYONE has said all day; so on the whole I'm doing rather well.')I've already mention the two characters who are allowed to survive - they are, coincidentally, the two least likeable characters, and the two that the world would most clearly be better off without.  Firstly there's the muscle-brained shark wrangler of the preceding paragraph.  Far more irritating than him, though, is the chef.  How I hoped against hope that the chef would get killed.  This racist, God-bothering simpleton, one of those people who randomly substitute the phrase `yo' ass' for the innocent pronouns that would otherwise end their sentences (so that instead of `I'm going to kill you' we get the nonsensical `I'm going to kill yo' ass'), this anti-social Bible-quoter who lets his pet PARROT, for Christ's sake, fly around the kitchen while he's cooking ... HE is allowed to live, and he, alone of all the characters, gets to videotape an in-case-I-don't-make-it message for his wife, a message so inane that even if he HAD died, it would have been a waste of tape.The computer-generated effects are rotten, too.Strangely, I don't hate this film as much as my words might lead you to believe; but I feel I ought.",Deep Blue Sea

But in here, a(n) (unethical) marine Biologist is looking for the cure for Alzheimer, so she remodels shark's brains or something like that. Unexpectedly, these mega sharks turn into intelligent animals and begin killing/eating everyone around.

I know ""Jaws"" did a thing back when, but I like this better. It doesn't mean it's a better movie, the same way that more people like pizza than salad even though salad is a better food.The biggest part of why I like it so much better is that it's a survivalist situation, in an isolationist setting, and the sharks are ""intelligent"" so they're actively hunting the humans so it becomes a killer creature feature too.The cast is really good, and you should probably recognize about half the faces, whether or not they've been in Marvel movies.The split story lines bother me a bit, and more when they're voluntary, but it works. And when someone gets eaten by a shark, everyone else greedily makes an opportunity of it in a good survivor's fashion.This is a movie fueled by adversity instead of stupidity, as is a soft requirement for some movies.

65,Sandcooler,"Samuel L. Jackson rules, that's about it",5,26 May 2010,"There's one scene in this movie I really like, and that's the one where Samuel L. Jackson gives his obligatory inspirational speech. It's not only the speech itself that's so great, it's mostly the completely unexpected climax to the scene. I sure wasn't expecting that to happen, quite brilliantly directed. The awesomeness pretty much ends there though, because the rest of the movie is just faceless people running around and occasionally being eaten by unconvincing CGI sharks. Also once in a while rapper LL Cool J drops by to deliver some misguided attempts at comic relief. The movie is never really that suspenseful or interesting in any way, because this thing has been done so many times before. I figured the makers would have come up with some variations on the formula, but Renny Harlin's approach is actually disappointly straight-forward. Of course it's done with a bigger budget than usual and with somewhat better actors, but that can't cover up how tired this stock plot really is.

So genetically advanced and intelligent that they realise they are being experimented on, and don't like it, so they rise up, a la Orwell's Animal Farm.Full of clichés, which is part of the fun, this has some good surprises along the way, a couple of the characters meet their demise in inventive death scenes, one of which involves Samuel Jackson's character, in the film's biggest surprise.Might have developed a cult following, similar to what Sharknado did 15 years later, if the film had either better acting (to draw the audience in more) , or worse acting (to laugh at) , as the two leads (Thomas Jane and Saffron Burrows) are just dull, bland, boring; they're just taking up space, but nothing more. Third billed Samuel Jackson is mostly wasted in a secondary supporting role, and he is surprisingly killed off quite a while before the ending of the film.And for all of the comparisons to Jaws, the film is nothing at all like it.

67,philip_vanderveken,A combination of Jaws and Titanic with too many Christian influences. YUK!!!,4,23 November 2004,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner: Deep Blue Sea wins the Oscars ... for the best rip off and the biggest crap. Let me explain myself: the best way to describe this movie is a combination of Jaws and Titanic with too many Christian influences. It's already bad enough that the director can't come up with an original movie, but why does he have to be so moralizing in it as well?The story is about scientists who may have found a cure for Alzheimer decease in the brain of sharks. But the scientists needed more brain tissue so they genetically manipulated the sharks so their brains would grow a lot larger. But the sharks use their extra brain capacity in their own advantage, becoming fearsome hunters who have developed the taste for human flesh...I guess you already know where the link between Deep Blue Sea and Jaws can be found. The sharks are at least as big as Jaws. They attack humans and can't be stopped by any means, not even steel doors or fences... But where do I get the link with Titanic? Well, for instance the flooded corridors and the water that flows in with incredible power really looked like Titanic's scenes to me. The same for the structure that eventually will go down into the deep (OK, it isn't a boat but it sure comes close).But the biggest problem with this movie is that it's so moralizing. For instance: One of the man on the project has spent two years in jail. The leader of the project doesn't trust him, but uses him as a shark wrangler (no harm done when he gets eaten alive, right?). But of course when the trouble starts he appears to be a very nice man who will do everything to help the others. The same for the cook. You just know from the beginning that he'll survive this. He's a black preacher, he once lost faith in God but is now very religious again. All I missed was a hymn like ""I once was lost, but now am found"" or something like that in the background. All the movie tries to say with this is that you should never judge a person on his past and that as long as you believe in God the devil (here in the person of sharks) can't harm you. What a bunch of ...(VERY LARGE BEEP)... crap!!!! In the end I was hoping that the sharks would win and eat them all alive. That would have been great, but probably not what the director had in mind. I give it a 4/10.",Deep Blue Sea
68,Gislef,Succeeds despite itself,6,1 February 2001,"I guess I find this movie strangely compelling despite itself. It's got the most cliched plot imaginable (scientists tampering with nature = ""bad"": who'd have thunk it?), cardboard characters, plot holes galore (so did the sharks plan the whole thing? If so, how'd they know the helicopter winch would jam?), scientific inaccuracies galore (sharks aren't build to swim backwards, no matter how smart they are), and cheesy f/x that make the Doom computer game graphics look realistic by comparison.Still, Reny Harlin has a weird sense of humor, and the characters are so exaggerated that it's hilarious. You can play ""Spot the Jaws references,"" or snicker at how Harlin undercuts Jackson's dramatic speech by having him eaten. In fact, this is just as much a meta-reference movie as Scream. The parrot gets eaten, in a tradition of horror movies where the pet always lives until the end even though its owners do stupid things to rescue it (see ""Alien"" for the best example). As Preacher says, ""The brother always gets it in this kind of situation."" and Harlin undercuts that too by having Preacher live despite being dragged around by the shark for an absurdly long time.The water and underwater sequences aren't bad (as long as you ignore the CGI shark sequences, and the characters are just stupid enough to be believable as human beings (albeit really _stupid_ human beings).Overall, if you view DBS as a Scream-type parody, you should enjoy it.",Deep Blue Sea

The sub plot about finding a cure for Alzheimer's, is a little far fetched, but it's a nice addition to create a real purpose to the characters quest. And reason for the platform's existence. The casting gives a solid performance and the most famous actors die first. Which I enjoyed a lot the first time I saw it. It meant that anything could happen, and it does until the very last minute.

It seems like the film makers thought about having a plot, but then they found they could have way more fun playing with the CGI Sharks (which are pretty good actually) The conversation between the film makers probably went something like this.'Hey i have a great idea for a story, we can breed super sharks with oversize brain capacity in the quest to find a cure for Altziemers disease' 'That sounds good, then we can have the sharks get out of control and add some action sequences' 'Yeah good idea, but lets show the scientific side first while we build the characters' 'Yeah of course we have to build the characters and set the scene, wow what's that over there; come and take a look what the special effects team have done it's brilliant' 'Wow that's really cool, lets have lots of that.''But what about the story and character depth' 'We could always show the sexy female lead in her underwear, i reckon that and loads of sharks and death will distract the audience enough and they'll never notice'And so Deep Blue Sea was born, and guess what? It's actually a good laugh and has wall to wall action, sharks and blood; and oh yeah!

Anyway, the smart sharks wreck a helicopter and it blows up half of the place; what's left of it begins to slowly sink. Now it's Poseidon Adventure meets Jaws as a group of scared folks try to escape the shark reserve, while the hungry sharks try to turn them into chowder.It's pretty routine. Characters get killed, one by one, as they work their way past obstacles. Usually just as they say or do something important. One guy is telling everybody to calm down and shut up; on cue, a shark comes along and shuts him up (permanently). Most of the film is like that, but there are enough action scenes and innovative shark attacks to keep things interesting.The female lead facing off with the shark in that small room is the coolest moment; the psycho cowboy vs. the psycho shark makes for a fitting finale.

73,oneguyrambling,In a billion dollar facility staffed by scientists the smartest things around are fish...,5,28 December 2011,"How could boosting the size and aggressiveness of massive genetically engineered sharks ever backfire? That's the type of deep philosophical question posed by the thinking man's Deep Blue Sea.It also has a parrot that constantly utters PG swear-squarks.Let's not mess around, of course the huge scientifically-assisted sharks go rogue and start tearing up the remote offshore research facility named Aquatica. It's more a matter of who they kill, and that really plays to Deep Blue Sea's (limited) strength, the cast.Aside from a large woman manning the radios whose role is basically to keep telling the staff (and us) that a big storm is coming, everyone else in the cast is in a similar boat (so to speak). Aside from Samuel L Jackson – and let's face it he was in every second movie made in the 90s anyway – everyone else is familiar yet largely unknown. Stellen Skarsgaard – The project Mastermind.  Saffron Burrows – A scientist.  Michael Rapaport – A junior scientist.  Thomas Jane – Dogsbody and diving expert.  LL Cool J – The cook.  Jacqueline McKenzie – Junior scientist, banging The Mastermind.If you had a look at a photo of the main cast you'd say ""Gee I know that guy/gal from somewhere"" at least 5 times. So when the shark hits the fan you're never sure who'll go first and how, which is really the only tension or uncertainty in these films anyway.The giant super-sharks are apparently 45 feet long but their size seems to vary to suit the situation, meaning at one point they can be attacking a stove door without success, the next they can be destroying a major door between passages with no trouble.Deep Blue Sea has one cool CGI assisted bit, it provides a momentary shock thanks to it being so unexpected, then it is over and we must put up with another 40 minutes of narrow escapes, holding one's breath underwater and moving through passages to escape from animals that are generally seen next to small piles of chips. Only these ones are the size of a caravan.Near the conclusion of the film we are asked to believe that everything occurring to that point was deliberately set in motion by three large fish. This includes several acts with unexpected consequences, occurring in a facility that the sharks couldn't possibly have seen nor expected to understand. In fact the series of events was so coincidental and unlikely that I can't imagine the screenwriter coming up with it in less than a few months.This means only one thing. Either the whole thing is a crock of sh*t OR the sharks had help on the inside Now I've wracked my brain as to who might have betrayed human secrets to the underwater menace about the facilities' weaknesses and structural deficiencies with no luck, and it couldn't possibly have been a crock of Hollywood sh*t lazily pitched and fed to the mindless masses that attend these films each year – myself included – could it?Should it be a concern that in a film set in a scientific facility with numerous scientists and scads of high tech lab equipment that the three smartest things in the film are fish? I vote yes.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. It's OK for what it is, but like fish themselves you'll forget it all 5 seconds after it passes.",Deep Blue Sea
74,baumer,The sum is not as great as its parts.,6,31 July 1999,"I know this film is supposed to stand on its own as a motion picture and comparisons to Jaws should be left out of it, but it is kind of hard to watch this film and not compare it to the Godfather of underwater terror movies.  And what made Jaws as scary as it is, is several factors really. First and foremost, we don't see the shark for at least an hour.  We see images of people getting eaten and lots of blood and we see an overhead glimpse of the shark's head and mouth as it eats the man in the estuary. Next, it had one of the best scores in the history of motion picture history.  John Williams had us scared in anticipation with his ominous music.  And third we had a dire situation where it seemed almost helpless for the three ""heroes"" to survive.  And the reason I mention these three things is because Deep Blue Sea really had none of these elements and thus leaving us with a film that is not all that great.  There is no real mystery to this film, no wonder of what the shark looks like or what it is capable of doing.  And again I realize that it doesn't have to be a carbon copy of Jaws, but it just isn't that entertaining.  Do you remember a film called Deep Star Six that came out maybe a decade ago?  It had a premise where there was a monster underwater at a secret base, and people get chased and people die.  It was unmemorable and people soon forgot about it.  I think that is ultimately the fate of Deep Blue Sea.  Still, there are a few things that were enjoyable about the film, one being the homage to Jaws.  First, one of the sharks brought in to the site early on has a license plate in his mouth.  The plate is removed and it is a Louisiana state plate, which is the same plate that the Tiger Shark had it's mouth in Jaws.  Also, the first two deaths of the sharks are a complete yet more subtle homage to Jaws.  In this film, the first shark explodes, and the second one is fried.  Jaws, it explodes, Jaws 2, it fries.  I like those simple touches.  Also good about the film is L.L Cool J.  He provides the film with most of the laughs and he plays his character well.  When he was on screen, I enjoyed it much more than when he wasn't.  That is great seeing as the guy really hasn't been in many films to showcase his talent as an actor, but this film should get him some recognition.  Also good is the fact that you don't know who is going to die and when.  Renny Harlin establishes that about half way through the film.  And I think everyone can appreciate that.  The set design in the film is almost a cross between Titanic and Aliens.  Deep Corridors, flooding hallways, claustrophobic surroundings and the very real possibility that the monster can and does pop out from every area that feasible.  And that does make the film scary, or at least tense in some parts.  Some of the deaths are scary and some of the scenes where people ellude death are funny, but that's the films downfall.  It has so much potential, and so many good individual parts, but it just couldn't pull the entire film together to make a great film.  It is sorta scary, quite funny, well acted by most, pretty well directed, poorly written, poorly scored, well photographed some of the special effects are done well and some aren't.  So that is it in a nutshell.  Deep Blue Sea was an okay movie, it just left me feeling unsatisfied at the end.  And it also made me mad because there is one death that just didn't need to happen, and that was put in there just to have some tense moments before credits role. 
There are worse movies out there this summer ( Wild Wild West, The Haunting ) and there are better ( Star Wars, Blair Witch Project, American Pie ).  So if you are going to see this one, make sure you go to a matinee.  It'll cost you about three dollars less and maybe that will help you enjoy the film more.  Don't expect to be scared out of your mind in this film, just expect a typical Hollywood shin-ding and perhaps you'll be entertained.  I was in some parts and then others left me feeling empty.  And what that comes down to is that the sum is not as great as its parts.",Deep Blue Sea

78,vip_ebriega,JAWS on steroids.,7,14 May 2008,"My Take: Slick, silly yet exciting summertime thriller. DEEP BLUE SEA is an all-in-one summer popcorn movie package. It's action-packed, thrilling, often scary, and at times funny. Although marred by occasionally overused clichés and occasionally dumb situations, DEEP BLUE SEA is a lot of fun, a package of thrills, action and comedy, all wrapped up with a package of some really smart sharks.Although we have a nice stellar cast of Thomas Jane, Saffron Burrows, LL Cool J, Samuel L. Jackson and a few others, the real stars are the sharks. The CGI effects are decent, not up to the standards of effects like those in the latest STAR WARS or JURASSIC PARK movies, but comparisons aren't needed. The sharks here, when they appear, the thrills don't come far behind. Action scenes with the sharks (and most action scenes are with them) are exciting and action-packed, and the scenes combining special effects with real humans are darn convincing.The plot concerns the finding of a fiber inside the brain of sharks that could cure the Alzheimer's disease. A laboratory set in the middle of the ocean (to set things up of course), with sharks (Mako sharks to be precise) captured and run through a series of tests. It's an accomplishment, with a drawback. By increasing the brain's size, the sharks got smarter.There's nothing really brilliant about the film, but it's a lot of summer movie goodness. The film has a lot of fun with and at itself. The screenplay, while offering a series of real thrilling action scenes and suspenseful ones, also offers some bits of comedy, usually from the character of the cook named ""Preacher"" Dudley (LL Cool J). The rest of the characters aren't very valuable, they're just characters in a summer movie throwaway. But I didn't mind. Ask yourself, what do you really expect from a movie that only demands your bag of popcorn and your summer movie cynicism.I've taken the liberty to defend a lot of summer movies, and DEEP BLUE SEA is no exception. For what it its, the film is great material, directed with some skill by action director Renny Harlin (DIE HARD 2).

LL Cool J is the cook and does a very nice job, his character even kills one of the altered sharks.

There are so many thing that you can pick holes in in this film but one thing you can't complain about is the entertainment. The main star of this film Samuel L Jackson and without spoiling it his departure is the best thing in the movie, not because his acting is bad but because the manor of it. This film is different in that the people who die are a big suprise, if i had to pick out the ones to cop it at the start at the movie i would have been completley wrong. The most irritating thing is the continuity of the film and what i mean by that is that when the Sharks are in the water they look huge but out of the water they look like a couple of sardines!

82,TOMASBBloodhound,Good laughs make up for its lack of terror.,6,7 March 2006,"Deep Blue Sea is really more of a satire than anything else, despite the frightening image on the DVD cover. As you view this film, you will notice the tendency of the better actors to become shark food before the lesser ones. This actually leads to some pretty good surprises along the way.The plot centers around a group of scientists trying to genetically engineer the brains of sharks to help find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease. All they end up doing is making a trio of hungry sharks smart enough to hunt in packs and wipe out most of the humans in the underwater facility. The film has plenty of stomach-churning gore, but the humor of the film makes it easier to take. The film was directed by Renny Harlin who usually knows how to pace his films, and his skill is on display here with this one.The acting is not very memorable since basically all those who can act are gone before the end of the first hour. Thomas Jane (Boogie Nights) and LL Cool J are pretty much the heroes, and they do as well as they can within the limitations of the script. The film could have used a better title, in my humble opinion. ""Deep Blue Sea"" sounds almost like some romance film you might find on Lifetime or some women's network.BIG SPOILER: As far as the biggest highlight of the film is concerned..... well, let's just say I have nothing at all against Samuel L. Jackson. I could, however, count on one hand the number of times I've laughed harder at something in a movie than I did after his death scene. That was unexpected, and hilarious. Anyone who claims they saw that coming is full of it.Deep Blue Sea is a fun movie. It's well-paced, has some thrills, and may keep you guessing. It's certainly no classic, and you won't remember much the next day after seeing it, but you could do much worse for a night of movie-watching.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Deep Blue Sea
83,ivo-cobra8,One of my favorite shark horror monsters movies and favorite Thomas Jane film,10,8 December 2017,"Deep Blue Sea (1999) is my favorite shark monsters horror film and favorite film of Thomas Jane. I am a fan of the actor and this one The Punisher (2004) and Thursday (1998) are his favorite roles. Carter Blake is my favorite Thomas Jane role he played. It is my childhood movie I saw it as a kid, I never had a problems with the film. It is fast paced, entertaining action horror flick. The idea about Alzheimer's disease making sharks smart was brilliant.I enjoy this film it is my favorite shark film, a lot of peoples are going for Jaws this is my favorite monster shark movie. From the actors, the plot, the story, music score, stunts and real practical effects no stupid CGI, I love movies like that. I love this film to death I love it so damn much. If you like Jurassic Park (1993) then you will like this one, this is another film with animals who become smart. A preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.In Jurassic Park was breakdown and a paleontologist with two kids in the park has to fight for survival, but in this movie a team of scientist must fight for survival when trio biogenic sharks becomes smarter and they flood the facility now the team must come on surfers and fight for survival.Searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease, a group of scientists on an isolated research facility become the prey, as a trio of intelligent sharks fight back. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on rampage and flood the facility.I love this film and it really surprised me with the plot twist:LL Cool J as Sherman ""Preacher"" Dudley so surprised me when he was stuck in the accident in the kitchen he dealt with the shark him self who eat his bird.Jumps out of upper oven and swims away, ""You ate my bird!"" lights lighter, throws lighter into open oven and blows up the shark fantastic scene.Thomas Jane as Carter Blake was the most smartest, tougher guy, brave shark hunter I have ever seen. He saved those people in the water in the opening scene from shark in which a shark wanted to eat them. I love his character he fought against the third shark and he kicked his ass. He was a brave hero I love the actor so damn much. He gave a good performance of him self. He wrestler the shark in which preacher shot's him with a harpoon and blows up the shark, but my hero survives I love that so much. Thomas Jane is a great actor I love him in this movie.Saffron Burrows as Dr. Susan McAlester anti heroine and the tritagonist the head of a team of scientists was excellent as the villain the same time was also a heroine in this film. I love the actress so much. Wonder what happened to her?, I don't see her in any good movies this days since she went making this movie ""Deep Blue Sea"". Saffron Burrows was great as Dr. Susan McAlester she electrocute the second shark with a power cable all by her self that was a bad-ass scene. She sacrifice her self by helping Carter stopping the third shark from escaping.This film was directed by Finnish director Renny Harlin who previous directed A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2, The Long Kiss Goodnight and Mindhunters which I thought he did a great job directing it. Music score for this film was excellent by Trevor Rabin.Jurassic World (2015) copied Deep Blue Sea (1999) T-Rex was faster and smarter hunter and he tricked people believing he escaped off the fence, but actually he was hunting them, they make, the T-Rex smarter hunter! I already saw that in Deep Blue Sea, when doctors implant the human brains in the sharks. In here they did the same thing with the T-Rex!This movie come out the same year as The Matrix come out and of course I went to see that movie in the movie theater with my mom. This movie I ranted in the video store a year later on VHS tape.Samuel L. Jackson is in here and he surprised he was eaten again the same he was eaten in Jurassic Park. I thought Samuel L. Jackson will be the lead guy, but I was surprised when he was eaten by a shark.Stellan Skarsgård is in this movie from Thor and Thor: The Dark World and he is so young and thin in this movie.You have adrenaline-pumped shock waves and of course you have a great explosion, great underwater scenes. Thomas Jane did 100% of him in this movie. Everything was for real no CGI bulls***.10/10 I love this flick to death, it is my all time favorite shark monster horror film. You love Jaws I love Deep Blue Sea to death! Especially I love the ending and the conclusion only two heroes survives in this movie.I love the song Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin) that was performed from LL Cool J. for this movie.",Deep Blue Sea
84,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Tense and underrated film from an under-appreciated director.,8,17 August 2008,"The premise of many movies can usually be crudely approximated by saying that it is: *insert movie title here* meets *another movie title*. Sometimes you can put in a ""via *yet another movie title*"" at the end for additional detail. If that's the case, then this movie is simply ""Jaws"" meets ""Aliens"" via ""Godzilla"" or ""Jurassic Park."" It is a very simple premise. But this movie is all about the execution.And the execution is very good. Nicely done elaborate sets, tense pacing, and some truly heart-pounding moments as scientists who have become trapped in an underwater, and slowly sinking deeper, facility try to make it out alive. The science is perhaps a little less fascinating that the science (or, rather, science-fiction) of ""Jurassic Park,"" and the science aspect of the film is kept to a minimum as this film is all about suspense. And it knows it, and as a result, that is just what it serves.Directed by the quite underrated Renny Harlin who has never had too much success after the smash sequel to ""Die Hard"" and the reasons are all beyond me. He directs great action scenes that make use of a variety of techniques and not just the quick frenetic cutting that other action directors seem to love. He really captures the motion of the action that is happening, and he manages to do it in a nice graceful fashion, which is ironic in capturing utter chaos. But that is really no matter since it works wonderfully. A scene where a helicopter crashes resulting in a tremendous explosion is a terrific example of this and it only gets better from there. Despite some corny story elements (this is an action movie, remember) and some glaringly obvious CGI (I don't think they dared use real sharks for some scenes!) it is still entertaining since the clichés are not there to the point of insult. In an action movie, clichés are inevitable, since the focus is on action and not deep plot. Many films fail at this by providing an assault on the senses for action, lame attempts at drama (that can be side-stepped in an action film with some cliché), and unrealistically badass characters. Sure, an action hero has got to be badass to a point, but some are just plain old silly since it totally conflicts with the drama they a film often tries to inject into its characters. Harlin has a knack for realizing this and offering great action/suspense and an acceptable level of cliché that is just part of the genre. --- 8/10BsCDb classification: 13+ --- violence/gore",Deep Blue Sea

Well, there it all is. Right there in a nutshell. Samuel L. Jackson, who is the film's central character up until he meets his demise right in the middle of the movie, had no enthusiasm in making this picture at all. It is quite obvious. He had some fun during the making of it, but all in all, I don't think it was a film credit he wanted attributed to him.On the other hand, the remaining cast members, Thomas Jane, Saffron Burrows and rap star LL Cool J all have the time of their lives as they fend of the killer sharks. Now, only a moron could not tell what film this was inspired by. Speilberg's smash 70's hit, JAWS was the grand-daddy of all action adventure movies, and this film is its closest grandson.
All in all, this film is a smart, entertaining creature flick. There are some notable special effects sequences, but other than that, there wasn't much else to brag about. Came out right around the same time LAKE PLACID did, which was probably what did this film in, as LAKE PLACID was a far better movie.

90,Movie-12,"Offers several shocking moments, but it is just so predictable and obvious. **1/2 out of ****",6,7 August 1999,"**1/2Director: Renny Harlin   105 minutes   Rated R (for graphic shark violence and some language)All right, lets try to get beyond the fact that ""Deep Blue Sea"" is a rip off of ""Alien"" ""Jurassic Park,"" and most obviously ""Jaws."" Lets all just black out the fact that this film is one of the most predictable, most obvious horror films in years. If we do that, than what to we have: one of the most exiting, suspenseful, shock provoking, and realistic looking horror films to come down the road in years. So how do I review a movie like this, so flawed, but so fun at times. Well, I won't put my thumb up or down here. I'll just give you the good and bad qualities of ""Deep Blue Sea"" and you make the call on your own call.The premise, both unconvincing and too quickly developed, takes a really big underwater sea base and puts its characters in charge of doing research to try to cure a deadly disease by experimenting a cerium on sharks. (I am unclear of why the characters had to use sharks for the testing, why not a dog or a cat?) The main scientist is Susan McAlester. While her wealthy supporter, Russell Franklin, is unsure about producing her ideas, he ends up lending a helping hand.The ocean crew consists of a cook, ""Preacher,"" and his bird who spews out profanity, Carter Blake, the guy who deals with the sharks personally, Dr. Jim Whitlock, Janet Winters, Tom Scoggins, Doc, and Glenn. Names don't mean much, do they? The filmmakers agree, for they have no compassion for the characters. They almost pick them off randomly after a certain point in the film. This concept offers the single most shocking moment in film history when Samuel L. Jackson is in the middle of a meaningful speech. It's moments like these that make ""Deep Blue Sea"" a good popcorn movie for the non-critical portion of an audience.It is now when the disasters strike. First, a hurricane hits the base with absolute strength. Then, the shark being experimented on goes nuts and takes a guy's arm off in the process of escaping. As he goes back into the base tanks, Susan explains to the rest of the crew how her team had to increase the size of the animal's brains to produce more protein in order for the medicine to work. In result the sharks got smarter. Now, all three of the sharks experimented on have motive, purpose and genius, and in an attempt to reach the deep blue sea to escape to freedom they will finish off more than 90% of the cast. They will eat them, rip them apart, and sometimes kill just for the sport.There is no major character development in the film, nor is there much reason to care about the characters. Director Renny Harlin wouldn't know how to elaborate on human emotion if it jumped out of the water and bit off his head. The characters have no purpose in the story other than to be eaten by the antagonists. This makes it kind of hard to root for the good guys, and not root for the sharks, but at least we know what and who they are.The sharks themselves are really neat. I saw an HBO special the other day about how the film was made. The filmmakers supposedly spent years designing and producing such a realistic looking animal to evoke terror in the likes of an audience. In that case the film does work. With its share of wonderfully frightful music, high class suspense and many characters to pick off like flies, the possibilities are unlimited and the filmmakers do take advantage of most of them.However, due to the enormously familiar story and characters with equal value to the filmmakers as flies on a web, after the few momentous sequences that make ""Deep Blue Sea"" partially succeed, it was only a madder of time before I found myself jumping ahead of the plot predicting which character would be the next to go.For better or worse, ""Deep Blue Sea"" offers less psychological terror and more character deaths  than ""The Haunting,"" a better film, albeit not much. So, is ""Deep Blue Sea"" worth seeing? Not at first run theater prices.",Deep Blue Sea
91,Bogmeister,It was bad enough as mindless eating machines,6,22 July 2005,"The ultimate in summer movie exploitation, this takes the Jaws concept and adds in the usual genetic tinkering to give our toothy adversaries an added advantage: brain-power! The goal was laudable: a cure for Alzheimer's; the side-effect: not good. Jackson plays a rich investor who decides to check out the progress on this work at a remote installation in the middle of the ocean. Very bad timing. Pretty soon, the crew and scientists are being picked off by a trio of nasty man-eaters which can think their way around our technology. Current special FX allow us to see stuff which was not possible a few years earlier. Needless to say, most of the cast are chewed into hamburger and the filmmakers do not spare us the full details of the various dismemberments, but, curiously, the effect is less gross and more in the vein of cartoon-style violence. Perhaps the modern mind instinctively knows that what we're seeing is not really happening, despite the incredible realism. Then again, if your DVD player is capable of freeze-frame/slow motion, you may notice in a couple of spots the fake cartoony blood inserted digitally.

The cast is nice for a change, no real big stars, there are a few surprises as to the picking order of the victims.

Inevitably, it all goes wrong and they have to escape the base while super smart CGI sharks (Which look good so it actually improves on Jaws in one way) chomp their way through a one dimensional B movie cast who have less facial range than the sharks themselves. Scientists and anyone else who cares about logic, stay away. Otherwise, you're in for a fun ride. In terms of subtlety, this is about as subtle as a tidal wave and it's more faster and more furious than a log flume at a theme park, but it also falls on repeat viewings. It's not as bad as some say it is (A terrible but enjoyable film-wrong). The film actually has some powerful shock moments and it's actually fairly suspenseful, while the visuals are pretty good. It knows what it is and what it wants to be: It's a B movie and it wants to be fun. That it is, but it can take itself too seriously at times.The cast threaten to sink the film to irretrievable depths. Saffron Burrows reinforces my theory that models make bad actresses, while Thomas Jane is gruff and dull throughout. LL Cool J is by far the best and brings lightness and the slightest bit of heart into a relatively mechanical movie, while Samuel L Jackson, despite his early exit is naturally excellent. The script lacks any sort of depth or flair, and it's overly serious and full of stupid decisions. As these characters get dumber and dumber, it gets harder to care. As for the plot, let's just not even go there. Deep Blue Sea, overall, deserves to be remembered for more than just one death scene. It's the third best shark movie of all time, and beats the many other dreadful shark films I've seen.

It's no ""Jaws"" to be sure, but it's a classic compared to the three ""Jaws"" sequels. It's about a team of scientists who work at an underwater facility somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. These scientists, led by Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows), have genetically altered the brains of three huge Mako sharks to develop a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease. This creates a major problem for the scientists. The Mako sharks have become more smarter than they ever imagined, and before long the scientists are on their menu. Who will survive? After a slow start, ""Deep Blue Sea"" becomes a very entertaining show all the way to the end. The special effects are good (if not great), and the action scenes are suspenseful and exciting. Be prepared for one moment in this film that will make you jump from your seat. The performances by the humans are good, but pale by comparison to the performances by the sharks. Samuel L. Jackson is kinda funny in this film, since his performance here is not some of his best work. LL Cool J on the other hand is very funny as the chef known as Preacher, who's best friend is a parrot. Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane (as shark wrangler Carter Blake) are fine even though their characters (as well as all the other characters in the movie) aren't developed that much. But these weaknesses are a minor factor. In my opinion, ""Deep Blue Sea"" was the best horror movie of last year. Yes, I though this movie was better than ""The Sixth Sense"" (very good), ""The Blair Witch Project"" (so-so), and ""The Haunting"" (terrible). However, ""Deep Blue Sea"" bares more of a resemblence to the crocodile picture ""Lake Placid"" which opened two weeks before this, than it does to those three big moneymakers. ""Lake Placid"" was good, but ""Deep Blue Sea"" was better. If you want some advice on what movies to see about killer sharks, see ""Jaws"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"". Forget about ""Jaws 2"", ""Jaws 3"", and especially ""Jaws The Revenge"". ""Jaws"" is the best, but ""Deep Blue Sea"" is close behind. And for those out there who thought this was a ""Jaws"" ripoff, come on! Give me a break! This movie has a different location (the undersea laboratory is not off Amity Island), different characters (no Brodys in sight), and different sharks (the ""Jaws"" movies had Great White Sharks; ""Deep Blue Sea"" has Mako sharks). And the shark attacks are much faster and more vicious.  I go to see these movies for scares, thrills, and excitement, and ""Deep Blue Sea"" delivers the goods.***1/2 (out of four)",Deep Blue Sea
107,AKS-6,Entertaining,6,13 May 2000,"The first thing you have to ask yourself when you rent a film like this, or watch it on tv, is: what does the director want with this film? Is Renny Harlin trying to go arthouse on us or does he want us to be entertained for a couple of hours (naturally, I'm not saying that arthouse films aren't entertaining)? My answer to this was that Harlin want me to be entertained probably without having to use my brain too much. So, from that viewpoint I started to watch ""Deep Blue Sea,"" and while it's not the best ""no brain needed""-film I have seen, I think ""Deep Blue Sea"" entertained me. Actually, it entertained me enough for me giving it a 6 out of 10. It could have been better if it wasn't for Saffron Burrows who behaved like she was in another film and looked like she was sleeping the whole time.

A team of DNA-altering scientists, experimenting on shark brains, is seeking a cure for Alzheimer's. Didn't their mothers ever tell them ""Don't mess with Mother Nature""? You can bet that the big-brained, mutant makos, which could now qualify for Mensa, will ultimately make fish food out of these pretentious men and women of science and pharmaceuticals.

Thomas Jane is functional as the stalwart hero who manages some super-human feats above and below sea level. He leads, as the team struggles to escape from the watery grave that Aquatica has become.

116,stevenrotherforth,Hey Sam there's a rather unconvincing shark behind you!,8,12 August 2018,"Deep Blue SeaAfter watching and immensely enjoying The Meg recently I have a hunger now for more shark filled movie treats.
So I thought I would revisit a film that is becoming old enough now to be considered as a classic of the genre.
By no means is Deep Blue Sea a masterpiece but like The Meg it is a damn good time.Originally released way back in 1999 it's a movie that hasn't aged well in terms of visual effects.
Set on a remote research station way out at sea a group of scientists try to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
Lead Scientist Dr Susan McAlester played rather coldly by Saffron Burrows has discovered that a certain protein which resides in the brain of sharks holds the key to such a cure.
The problem is to harvest enough protein the scientists need to make the sharks brains much bigger.
Bigger brain means smarter fish which means sooner or later the clever carnivores will over throw their human captors.
Sounds absolutely ridiculous doesn't it?
Well you're right it is but DBS still manages to grip and enthral its audience with a series of nail biting set pieces.
Director Renny Harlin sure knows how to direct good action scenes. With movies like Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2 and The Long Kiss Goodnight under his belt he sure has a proven track record.Deep Blue Sea is an exciting movie with a good ensemble of characters. Harlin devotes just enough time to allow the audience to get to know the crew.
That way when the gruesome deaths start to happen we will root for those onscreen.DBS is as much a disaster movie as it is a shark one.
The brainy beasts figure out that by sinking Aquatica (the inventively named research station) they will be able to escape out into the ocean.
Apparently that's what a 8000-pound Mako shark with a brain the size of a flathead V-8 engine and no natural predators thinks about!
By sinking the facility the humans become trapped and must also fight to get out without either drowning or being devoured.What makes Deep Blue Sea work isn't the action or the terrible CGI but the cast.
Renny Harlin really has managed to wrangle together a great set of performers here who help sell this rather silly B movie.
This was the first time I had seen Thomas Jane in a movie and I think he's the real stand out here.
He plays Carter Blake, a shark wrangler who you just know is the dude who will save the day.
From his charismatic performance here I believed he would go on to be the next big action star. Sadly it didn't work out that way.
Stellan Skarsgard is believable as the eccentric scientist Jim Witlock. His gruesome death being a particular highlight.
Also LL Cool J brings the comedy element as the god fearing chef named Preacher.
It is perhaps Samuel L Jackson who is the weakest link.
He basically plays himself again and it's fitting when he gets ripped in two by two hungry sharks mid way through the movie.
This particular scene brings me on to the special effects. Sam Jackson's death scene is one of the worst CGI creations in the history of cinema.
The problem is the computer generated sharks don't move naturally. There's no organic flow to their movement.
They appear not to be moving through liquid but rather like gliding through air.
It's rather distracting and the fish look like poorly rendered visuals from an early PlayStation game.
The animatronic effects fair much better. The mechanical creations move through water much more convincingly and they are detailed superbly.
Well they are until you notice that a Tiger shark looks exactly the same as a Mako only with stripes.
In reality a Tiger shark has a much blunter snout and bulkier body.
Here though the SFX guys have just used the same model only spray painted stripes over its back to make it look like a different species.
People who love all things Sharky will notice this!Comparing DBS to other movies of the genre. It's never going to live up to the legend that is Jaws and unlike The Shallows, which starts out as a supremely crafted thriller only to nose dive into the sea of crazy in the last five minutes, like The Meg, Deep Blue Sea is a silly film so you just go along with the silliness.
There's no jarring changes of personality in the movies tone.
From start to finish it is pure action and suspense held together by a bunch of likeable characters that the audience will grow to care for.

119,Okonh0wp,deservedly confident enough to know that it doesn't need a plot,5,5 July 2004,"This film is deservedly confident enough to know that it doesn't really need a well-thought out exposition because it knows it can more than make up for it in the second act. Essentially the film starts out, experts in a field I can't even remember, visiting some sort of scientific facility where they, for some purpose or another, genetically engineer sharks to make them smarter. Everyone who comes to this meeting, even Samuel L. Jackson who spouts off wise sayings as if he's preparing for his upcoming role as a Jedi knight in Star Wars, is pretty boring and underdeveloped. The only character who catches our attention is the resident cook, played by L.L. Cool J, who had the aura of being a little smarter than he lets off to be. Later, he is one of the people we root for most.The exposition is a little bit sloppy and for the purpose of the audience's intelligence, it would have been nicer if the writer's had at least put in an effort to make a coherent story behind the action. Nevertheless, we're able to discern that these sharks are genetically engineered and that the beautiful but cold and humorless Dr. Susan McAllister, in the name of science, made the mistake of engineering these sharks beyond scientifically acceptable levels. Around the time, we learn this secret, the action gets under way and the sharks have escaped. The struggle among the group of scientists to make it out of the complex alive is an incredibly terrifying ride, and we're desperately rooting for these people because the sight of seeing one of them eaten by a shark is pretty graphic (fair warning to people who have weak stomachs). Ultimately, and I won't say which ones, some make it out alive and some don't, which raises a curious case of lifeboat ethics (as in which ones deserved to survive and which ones didn't). The struggle of Dr. McAllister, was interesting too, as her genuine determination to cure diseases with the experiment that triggered this disaster, comes to turn into regret and more. **1/2 stars out of 4",Deep Blue Sea
120,jayjaycee,Guilty Pleasure material drowning in its own stupidity,5,26 January 2021,"""Deep Blue Sea"" is a 1999 action horror film directed by Renny Harlin starring Thomas Jane and Saffron Burrows.
⚪
All in all, Renny Harlin's late nineties shark flick harpoons an irrefutably silly but at the same interesting premise, and in the process, manages to create a blood-curdling scenario with some surprisingly great ideas and a distinct feeling of subaqueous dread, but in the end, it sadly floods its unstable concept with terrible acting, major plot holes, questionable visual effects and by blatantly ripping of everything that has ever happened in ""Jaws"" films, and thus it becomes an enjoyable yet utterly cheesy and anything but outstanding trash gem that thinks it has more brains that is actually has and eventually drowns in stupidity.
⚪
I never really thought that I was going to say such a thing, but it indeed feels like it has been ages since I have seen this film. Almost a decade ago, my passion for film was sparked when I watched Steven Spielberg's terrorising masterpiece ""Jaws"", and I was so enthusiastic with it that it wanted to write an article about it. Fortunately, I happened to be working at my own school newspaper. After consultation with my chief editor, I was allowed to write a piece about the top three sharks of all time. As a result of my research, I came to the conclusion that (at that time) the three commercially most successful shark films were ""Jaws"", ""Open Water"" and this one here. So, as a further part of my journalistic investigation, I turned on my tiny computer and watched it on this small screen, and thinking about it reminded me how far I have come since then. Over the years, the monitor made way for an HD television set and Blu-Ray player, and reminiscing about how I got from there to where I am nowadays, how much time and money I have spent, I indeed felt slightly proud about it. Anyways, the walk down memory lane put aside, I rewatched a film that downright terrorised me back then, and honestly, has frightened me to a certain degree even now. Renny Harlin's trash flick can best be described as guilty pleasure material, because even if it has its decent moments, there are twice as many other aspects that make it ridiculously bad, and honestly the premise isn't even that terrible at all. In order to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, a group of scientists took up residence at an underwater research facility on the open sea and genetically manipulated a group of Mako sharks, to extract a certain protein from their brains. However, as a tropical storm approaches and destroys the location, the security measurements malfunction, and the scientists as well as a few other crew members are trapped in the basement and everything is flooded as well. The sharks? Well, since everything is waterlogged, the highly intelligent fish begin to hunt down the survivors mercilessly. Silly? Yes. Entertaining as hell? Absolutely! Believe it or not, even if the concept is blatantly stolen from ""Jurassic Park"" (a rich man finances a high tech facility with genetically manipulated, highly dangerous animals, and after a storm causes the security measurements to fall out, said animals to run free, it turns into a horror survival trip), and the antagonistic animal and all of its features were obviously ripped off of ""Jaws"", there is still a lot to enjoy in this trashy film. To all the gamers out there: Do you remember that laboratory level with the sharks swimming around in the first ""Resident Evil"" game from 1996? This is basically the movie adaptation of said segment, and it is just as hilarious as it sounds. However, if there is one thing to seriously acknowledge about this film, it is how it managed to indeed create a threatening atmosphere. From small corridors, flooded stair cases and rooms to explosions, it knows to use all of its feature to scare the audience - and just as I did back then - I felt uncomfortable and claustrophobic most of the time. Nonetheless, the menacing setting is already the only great thing about the film, because all other aspects rank from mediocre to terrible. The characters are unintentionally hilarious and stereotypical. Aside from a bunch of shallow (pun intended) scientists that are destined to be shark fodder from the start, you have Saffron Burrows as the over-ambitious turned evil doctor who values her vicious creation over human lives, Samuel L. Jackson as the rich man who finances all, Thomas Jane as a shark tamer (yes, you read correctly) who is the typical cool dude with a dark past, and aside from speaking in maritime puns and slipping whenever there is water, he leads the group, of which LL Cool J is also a part, since he plays the comic relief character of a religious cook/gangster. Together they try to escape their watery grave and the sharp teeth of their guinea pigs (metaphorically speaking). The thing is, despite the in itself solid story, the technical and practical features are what pull the production down into an abyss of ridiculousness. Since the most talented actors of the film are killed of early in the film, the rookies/b-list actors take the lead, and as you can guess, what they deliver is mediocre at best. Burrows and her emotionless face as well her British accent, Thomas Jane's impassive, straight face and tough guy attitude and LL Cool J's attempt at being funny are unintentionally funny, and not even in the good way. They are nothing but b-movie horror clichés in human form, and there is nothing to gain from them. Furthermore, what made me think that it is PS1 game even more are the effects. While the animatronics are quite acceptable, the GCI is painfully cheap and, once again, took away all seriousness of it. The degree of brutality is alright and well-done for that time, but ugh, the visuals are dreadful. Also, speaking of which, unlike its altered fishes, the script is anything but intelligent. Yeah, the methods of research might make sense in some way (I cannot really tell, I am no scientist), but I can tell that it creates many plot holes by contradicting all rules it laid down in the beginning. Like, the sharks are supposed to be like 45 feet long, so how in the hell are they able to fit in the small hallways of a facility created for humans? Why can they literally smash metal doors but no oven in one scene, let alone a freaking metal fence? Why are humans able to run away from them in the water, even though its their territory? Oh, and aside from the constantly varying size of the fishes, why are they literally killed off like the sharks have been in all ""Jaws"" films? There is just so much wrong with the logic, that hurts - and the peak of physical pain isn't even reached until the utterly cringe worthy song rapped by LL Cool J himself is played during the credits. In the end, this film is only enjoyable as a guilty pleasure. Nothing more, nothing less, because all director Harlin did was reusing all the best ingredients of already existing animal horror films. It is anything but innovative, smart or outstanding. Is it fun, though? As crazy as it sounds, yes, and that's what I give it credit for. Despite being the cheap kind, it offers a certain thrill most of the time and turns it into an enjoyable trash film.",Deep Blue Sea

In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned Markos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned. Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses the worst time for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL Cool J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsgård round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the Markos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and as a series of action set-pieces, Deep Blue Sea never disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver in Alien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; that Deep Blue Sea can be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its Shylock charms.",Deep Blue Sea

The basic plot may seem unrealistic and rather weird indeed, but the action sequences and the script are really original and intelligent. The ending, especially, is quite unpredictable and I appreciate it very much.Both Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane look and act fine in this film. Burrows stripped down to her undies at one scene and I couldn't help appreciating her physique and also the screenwriter's excuse to provide us that. Jane is one of the low-key actors that I look for. This may not be his best work (in 'Dreamcatcher' he's quite good) but he did provide a strong male lead in the film.

129,tburke85,Deep Blue Sea A Decent Action Thriller,7,16 June 2009,"Deep Blue Sea is a decent action thriller from director Renny Harlin whose admirable in making this story about a group of scientists on an isolated research facility searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease who find themselves prey to a trio of huge intelligent Mako sharks. The cast are good in their roles including Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rappaport, and Samuel L Jackson whose role in the film like many others is cut short. Stellan Skarsgard and Aida Turturro shows up for a brief appearance before being written out of the movie rather quickly like Jackson and McKenzie. The special effects are quite good and the sharks do look terrifying. You definitely wouldn't want to be swimming in the water with these things in there. No way in hell. The action sequences most of them involving someone getting eaten in a gruesome way by one of the sharks are well executed. You can sort of tell it's obviously CG but the sharks still look cool none the less. The decisions some of the characters made like enhancing the brain of sharks isn't the brightest idea in the world but I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the movie. There is some suspense once the sharks get loose into the facility and begin to hunt the researchers one by one but some of their deaths were a bit predictable because you saw it coming from a mile away. Despite it's flaws though Deep Blue Sea is still a solid action thriller with just enough gruesome deaths at a steady pace, cool special effects especially the sharks, some suspense, a little humor, and decent performances by the cast thats sure to please almost any fan of the genre.",Deep Blue Sea
130,SMLA11,"Cool, yet gory",10,11 May 2002,"I thought that this movie was very good.  It had a good plot, good acting, and good characters.  The movie takes place in an isolated place in the ocean.  Where a group of scientists are searching for the cure of the Alzheimers disease.  While one of the characters is feeding the shark, the shark attacks the character and the other scientists are about to kill the sharks until one VERY dumb character frees the shark.  A huge storm approaches and the have to get the victim out of their.  When the helicopter arrives,  the sharks are smart enough and take the place down.  Now it is up to the scientists to get out of their alive before they become minor snacks for the shark.The acting is superb over everybody.  Thomas Jane plays the good character well and I enjoyed him.  Samuel L. Jackson's character is cool but he is not onscreen long enough.  LL Cool J plays a good comic relief and whenever he was onscreen, I enjoyed him.  Michael Rapaport acts well and I enjoyed his character probably most of all.  The rest of the characters are well-acted, especially the British lady. She's good.Overall this movie is EXTREMELY gory.  These sharks makes Jaws look like a creampuff.  I am VERY surprised that this movie went OK with the censors. I mean these sharks have more gore than 4 Friday the 13th Movies combined! Everybody either gets ripped in half, limbs ripped off or something sick. personally, I did not enjoy all of the gore, but overall this movie was good enough.  Rating 8 out of 10.",Deep Blue Sea
131,fimimix,..sure scared the heck out of me..,9,13 May 2006,"...because I KNOW sharks are eating-machines. Boo! Boo! Boo! to all those who say this was a tacky movie. What do they know ? Some folk don't realize that sharks regularly make a dinner of one another, I guess. They'll attack anything ! witness the same license-plate from ""Jaws"". You can't always depend on a certain director, actor/actress to give a first-rate performance. As for people criticizing Sam Jackson for being in this film, maybe he was looking for something easy to do to make a week's rent, huh? Every role can't be Shakespeare ! One commentator defies ANYONE who knew that he was going to get attacked by the shark during his ""rally-the-troops"" speech - guess what, I kept telling him to move away from that big tank behind him, because the sharks knew it was there and how to get in it. I'd have been as far away as I could get from ANY water. I admit that scene with the shark pitching the guy in the stretcher against the window and breaking it was a bit far-fetched....the tank wasn't big enough to get-up that much speed, but it sure scared me ! Please wise-up the commentator who said those big sharks swam through those tiny doors: they punched them in. Didn't you see the shark swim into the under-sea wreckage? I guess no one noticed the 'copter got its hook caught on the deck and banged into the watch-tower. What is totally unbelievable to me is the 'copter was out in that kind of weather, anywho, but the explosion was colorful. Believe it or not, sharks don't need deep water to swim in - most attacks occur very close to shore. I have real-life pictures of them body-surfing right along with humans. Santa Monica Bay gets its share of attacks, because folk are crazy enough to swim among sea-lions - one lady poo-poo-ed it and lost her life. I also have a real-life picture of some dumb fool on a ladder dropped from a 'copter, with a shark almost as big as these guys, jumping completely out of San Francisco Bay - right under The Bridge - to snatch him - close call! LL Cool J was great in the movie -it needed his comedy and skepticism to offer relief between the belly-crunchers. ""Jaws"" was an entirely different type of film - we knew there was a big fish out there, but ""Deep Blue Sea"" ANNOUNCED on its cover there would be eat-em-ups. Join all the other whiners how dumb this movie was, if you want to, but I love it - plan to watch it again next week - I'm already scared. You guys go in the ocean whenever you want - I'll stay on shore. That's as close as I plan to get to ""The Deep Blue Sea"".",Deep Blue Sea

135,erwan_ticheler,This movie SUCKS!,4,15 November 2002,"SPOILERS! Deep blue sea is a very,no VERY bad movie. Every bad cliche there is to think about horror and especially shark movies is in this one.The story is about a group of so called scientists on a floating and underwater laboratory. Samuel L. Jackson(what the hell is he doing in this disgraceful movie?) comes to the compound because he is the boss of it all. The scientists have created sharks with a lot of protein,but to achieve this they had to multiply the shark's brain 5 times,this logic strikes me. Of course the huge shark escapes during an experiment because one of the scientists doesn't want to kill it(where have I seen that before). Of course before they are able to catch this monster almost every character has to die,among those is Sam L. and at that point all hope for this movie is gone,if there ever was any. The sharks are so smart that they can swim backwards(??) and misguide the humans by letting them think that they don't want to escape the compound while this was of course there general purpose. To prevent the shark from escaping the leading girl(English accent is over-the-top) cuts herself and draws the shark to her after which the shark eats her in two. This is probably the only surprise of the movie,but a very bad and confusing one because the girl doesn't have to die at all. then one of the leading male characters jumps into the water and ""outspeeds"" the shark(???) and then climbs one him while miss cast LL Cool J shoots the shark and then blows him up so the only survivors are two men and no women,perhaps the director is very old-fashioned.Now I will give you some very bad and cliche parts of the movie: 1: The shark can break through a steel door but cannot break oven glass! 2: LL Cool J cannot die because he asks for the help of God and of course like in every bad Hollywood movie when you ask God's help you are immortal so from the moment you see LL you just know that he will survive! 3: The sharks in motion are very bad,it looks like a cartoon. Even the Shark-classic Jaws has got a better shark and that movie is from 1975! 4: The scene in which the girls sacrifices herself by jumping in the water is hilarious in a bad way,because after she jumps in the shark turns himself towards her like you would expect in a Looney Tunes cartoon! The death of the girl is too exaggerated and totally not in line with the rest of the movie. 5: The death of the shark is a copy of Jaws 2. 6: The final scene looks very much like Jaws.Overall,this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and not even the great Samuel L. Jackson can't change that! 1/10",Deep Blue Sea
136,QueenoftheGoons,As good as Jaws,10,28 June 2021,"This movie is great on all levels just like Jaws. The music, the actors, the goon, the sharks- all really good. Samuel L jackson's demise is memorable and what a beastie of a shark.",Deep Blue Sea
137,NerdBat,A Personal Classic,5,17 September 2017,"I watched this movie over and over as a child. I had this profound obsession with any type of monster, creature, large reptile, anything of the sorts. Now this movie certainly isn't the next ""Jaws"", but it's worth the watch. It sends us all a message that while science can do amazing things for us, we have to be careful with what we're getting ourselves into. To quote Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, ""Your scientists were too preoccupied with whether or not they could, they never stopped to think if they should"". Well, that's pretty much the basic message of this film. Watching it now at my age, I can see how truly horrendous the CGI effects are though. That and the fact that the sharks seem to constantly change size between scenes. Never heard of a 45 foot Mako shark, especially when great whites are enormous but rarely exceed 20 feet. That's from the point of view of a scientist like me though. I would say it's worth the watch, a good movie to introduce your kids too if you want them to appreciate monster movies like you do.",Deep Blue Sea
138,Mike-DD,Full of Suspense,8,23 August 2000,"While not a particularly superb shark movie (which can ever compare to the original classic - Jaws?), this movie has its redeeming qualities, one of which is the suspense that permeates throughout. It seems no real people live in Hollywood movies. Where do you find people who would willingly wade in shark-infested waters to grab research papers, try to save a bird when your own life is in peril, and sharks with teeth which can crush metal with one bite but needs more time to bite through human bones? But keeping the viewers in almost constant suspense makes up for a mediocre plot. After all, who'd expect what happens to Samuel L. Jackson in mid-film? Trying to out-guess the sharks was also fun, though I sometimes think it is quite improbable that sharks as smart as these can make silly decisions sometimes, as at the end of the film. After all, the sharks are gifted with advanced intellect and brain capacity, and should be able to control their 'emotions' and instincts better.",Deep Blue Sea

So that we decided to watch ""Deep Blue Sea"". Well... It was exactly what I was expecting: a commercial film, with bad acting and unbelievable. However, we and the audience we were with had good fun.Maybe the biggest problem with ""Deep Blue Sea"" is the acting. The actors may be not bad, but they are not the right people to the parts. Instead of Saffron Burrows, they should have put Sandra Bullock, Denise Richards or Mira Sorvino. They are used to this kind of part. The rest of the cast is also inappropriate and they should have also been replaced.It may be hard to forget the defects of this film while you're watching it, but there are some 'qualities'.

The variation this movie tries out involves some genetic alterations that make the sharks intelligent instead of mindless.  What elevates the movie is its sense of humor. The characters are all cliches, and the fun lies in seeing them torn sadistically to shreds.  If that sounds cruel, all I can say is you had to be there.  There's also suspense, of the ""How the hell are we going to get out of this one?"" variety, some excellent effects, and a fine performance by Samuel L. Jackson, who seems to get cast in these things (Sphere, Jurassic Park).  The climax of his inspiring speech to the other characters sets the tone for the rest of the movie.",Deep Blue Sea

Among the cast are Stellan Skarsgard (GOOD WILL HUNTING) doing an admirable job, Thomas Jane, also doing the best he could as our hero, Michael Rapaport in supporting role, Cool J giving some comedy relief with a parrot, Samuel Jackson, giving his presence and prestige to this film, and Saffron Burrows, who annoyed me the most. Defiant to the others and wanting to keep the sharks in tact, she managed to cause the deaths of many others. I couldn't wait till her surmise.

Scientists have used a chemical process to enlarge the sharks brain. Now why the he*l would they do that? you might ask. It turns out that the sharks' brain contains a revolutionary cure, and the larger the brain the more cure they can get. Predictably, but not in a boring manner, things go horrible wrong.

But what weighs it down is the unrealistic things about it- the way the sharks act. I mean, the shark turning the oven switch with it's fin? C'mon. And one of the guys manages to kill the shark in the room before it gets to him? He'd be dead in 2 minutes if it were real.Pros: Very Entertaining and full of suspense.

The effects in the film are digital, but do not blend well with the live action footage, in effect, things look highly unrealistic.

87% of google users liked this movie.This was my 3rd time watching this movie. Watched it for the first time in 1999 in theaters as a kid and loved it. I am much more critical of it today.Summary/conclusion of my review: This is overall a decent shark movie every shark movies fan should watch. It has a unique shark plot with a unique premise. The plot is unique enough to make you stick around until the end. However and unfortunately, the movie suffered from poor casting, bad shark CGI, and overall a failure to evoke visceral fear, horror, and despair from the viewer. But to be fair, evoking true fear from a viewer is extremely hard to achieve and very rarely achieved in the film industry. If you like shark movies, give this one a shot, and even if you do not, the plot is still unique enough to make your time sort-of worth it.Just yesterday I watched Jaws (1975) and Jaws 2 (1978).Unlike Jaws 1 and 2, this movie goes into ""shark action"" much earlier, as in sharks get to do what they do best, and I as the viewer got to enjoy 70 minutes of some level of suspense. In contrast, in Jaws (1975) you only get a few minutes of suspense and that is towards the end of the film, while in Jaws 2 (1978), you do get about 1/2 hour of some sort of suspense; however, in both Jaws movies the characters are always above water on top of some sort of safe-ish-surface. I guess the technology was not there for underwater cameras back then? Well to evoke true fear from a viewer when it comes to 6,000-8,000 lb. 20-25 feet great white sharks sharks, it makes common sense you have to put the people inside the water with those beasts, which Deep Blue Sea (1999) did.Unfortunately, I did not experience visceral fear, horror, despair, and urgency the characters would have felt if such events happened in real life. What I am saying is that I did not experience any emotions that a shark movie should have evoked from me even when the characters are in the water with the sharks.What is even worst, the shark CGI was not great, but just O.K. Jaws (1975) had better shark CGI than this 1999 movie. The kills in this film were very sudden and looked unrealistic. There were multiple times when the sharks looked and felt fake.On another note, the orchestra music correctly matched the scenes in this movie, unlike Jaws which had mostly triumphant sounding orchestra that did not make any sense in such movies.The screenplay - it made sense and felt appropriate what every character said in all scenes. Good screenplay.Samuel L Jackson - (the boss) - acting was O.K., but his acting felt like acting. He did not make the facial expressions and say things with the tone he needed. Very disappointing.LL Cool J - (the cook) - good acting. Felt real enough. Good work.Michael Rapaport - did good enough.Thomas Jane - (male lead ) - O.K. acting. Maybe a different lead would have helped the film.Saffron Burrows - (female lead) - O.K. acting. A different lead would have been better.Conclusion: same as summary.7/10",Deep Blue Sea

While not everything in the film is original, it is still an entertaining shark attack movie with some tense moments that is very enjoyable.The film borrows a lot from the ""Jaws"" movies, including music that sounds a little like the music in ""Jaws"", the slow, underwater shark vision, and even the deaths of the sharks go with the three deaths in the the first three ""Jaws"" films, exploded, electrocuted, and exploded again with its body parts going everywhere. The fact that the sharks are hunting the humans through the underwater base can also go with ""Jaws: The Revenge"" and how the shark was hunting the Brody family. Even at the end, a scene similar to the first ""Jaws"" film where the shark is about to be shot and blown up is shown. But, whatever, I still enjoyed this movie.Something I like is that even though the sharks were shown too early in the film so you did not have a sense of mystery to the creatures, the film was still tense with having the sharks pop up suddenly. Even though I knew ahead of time about some of the jump scares and was prepared for them, they still got me. Yes, it is not a perfect film and that is not too much to expect from a horror movie like this that deals with three genius level sharks hunting eight people and a parrot through an underwater base, but it plays to its strengths, has some good performances, and the tension is enough to chill your spine.

Has lots and lots of action scenes.Unlike some, I quite enjoyed this flick, I especially liked LL Cool J as the cook, he made for comic relief in what could've been a bad movie.  Too bad about his parrot...The sharks were fearsome enemies, just check out the scene at the end! The fact they were highly intelligent made these C.G.I created sharks much more deadly (and interesting).There were a few glaringly obvious holes in the plot, such as swimmers holding breath for amazing lengths of time, an oddly constructed facility that would've sunk the instant a storm hit it etc, but this is forgiven by lots of tense action.Although certainly not original this is still a fun flick to watch. I rate it 7/10.",Deep Blue Sea
158,CriticalOfEverything,Every death in this movie is hilarious.,2,28 February 2020,"This movie is so mind-numbingly bad and filled with holes, rock stupid characters, cliches and over-exaggerated performances that it's actually brilliant. The horrifically bad CGI (even for 1999 standards) adds to that brilliance, COUPLED with the fact that every death in this movie is so over the top and poorly executed whilst the soundtrack basically screams at you adds to this movie being a true masterpiece of unintentional comedy. It really needs to be seen to be believed, because if I told you right now that this movie's events would happen because a stretcher bearer fell and caused a helicopter to crash and explode on a fat woman in a tower, you would NOT believe me.

159,dalton2,The Special Effects movie: A new genre is born...,4,27 December 2000,"Computers are among us. They make possible incredible effects we would never have imagined before. In this case, they created several sharks swimming and eating people. But sometimes (many times, I'm afraid) they think that the effects themselves can support the whole weight of a movie, and that's a terrible mistake. As it happens in The Perfect Storm (2000), they only offer a collection of CGI scenes with nothing else valuable. What's more, in my opinion, the effects aren't perfect (it's obvious for us to identify which scenes are computer generated scenes), and as a result we have another mediocre effects movie. Maybe a new genre is finally born: the Special Effects movie, including all those films with nothing but effects.My rating: 4 out of 10.",Deep Blue Sea
160,drawlife,The only decent shark film since the original Jaws.,6,30 March 2015,"The problem with shark films is that, once you hear about it, people immediately think of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece Jaws. So how do you approach a shark film without repeating Jaws? The answer is Deep Blue Sea. Researchers and scientists harvest brain fluids from sharks for a cure for Alzheimer's disease, but unknown to the other scientists, Dr. Susan McAlester(Saffron Burrows) and Dr. Jim Whitlock(Stellan Skarsgard) violated the code of ethics and genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, with the side effect of the sharks getting smarter and bigger. In a genre full of clichés, this film at least keeps you guessing here and there. What director Renny Harlin establishes is that anyone can die, the whole cast is expendable, and ultimately fodder. However, in doing so he at least allows you to get to know the characters before they're shark food, some more than others. One can understand why Dr. McAlester is so driven for a cure, but ultimately it's all her fault for the events that take place in the film. Thomas Jane is good in the role Carter Blake, who is a shark wrangler. He also somehow magically dodges every shark that comes towards him and rides on their fins like Aquaman. Almost unrealistic, but the movie is so fun you just kinda go along with it and Jane handles the actions scenes quite well. Plus he holds his breath under water like no human can which can be impressive, but again a bit of a stretch. LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport provide sharp wisecracks and provide the film's humor. Samuel L. Jackson also has a decent supporting role as Russell Frankin, the research team's financial backer.The shark deaths are brutal and unforgiving and may make some uneasy. The problem with this film is that, although the shark attacks are effective, it tries a lot to make you uncomfortable and it becomes too one-noted. Of course in a film like this it's expected. The whole time you have no idea who is going to die next, and those sharks are relentless and a lot more vicious. Director Renny Harlin effectively uses the timing, suspense and the element of surprise so kudos to him. The shark puppets look great, but the same cannot be said for the cgi shark effects, it's dated and doesn't hold up. Deep Blue Sea is pure popcorn entertainment. The film doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table, but again it keeps you guessing and at times it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's an effective shark film, and it tires to be a good film. That's something I can appreciate. 6.5/10",Deep Blue Sea

Sharks jumping several feet out of the water to snatch a bite but incapable of clearing an office table. Men manually closing hatches with tons of water pressure on them. A shark blown to smithereens by a 50 gram powder charge - a charge being detonated by a single uninsulated wire. A chef heavily mutilated climbing a ladder to detonate it. High voltage circuitry submerged in water still working. Sea water with nothing in it but a couple of sharks - no weed, no fish, no plankton, yet at one time considered murky.

When I see a movie I want to be able to see the whole screen. Deep Blue Sea had better graphics; I really liked seeing the guts and blood come out when the sharks tear them in half. I expecially liked it when Samual Jackson got devoured during his speech. He deserved it.  I didn't care for the female lead, she got on my nerves by letting the shark out when the shark bit off that one guy's arm. I always thought that it was the bird's voice that talked, but I was wrong. It turned out to be a human voice. I guess people don't want their parrots to curse. People who compare this to Jaws is way off and doesn't understand movies at all. Jaws attacked because that it is what sharks do.Deep Blue Sea sharks attacked because they were pissed off (and can you blame them?)

165,andrewmerritt-31652,What went wrong,5,8 November 2019,"Deep Blue Sea stars Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, and LL Cool J, and is directed by Renny Harlin, the person who made Die Hard 2. The story follows a group of scientists who are conducting research on an isolated facility so that they may find a cure for Alzheimer's from sharks. However eventually the sharks become super intelligent and the crew must fight to survive. What do you get when you combine Jurassic Park and Jaws? Deep Blue Sea is your answer. I will have to give credit to the screenwriters that the idea is an interesting concept, but the problem is it tries way too hard to be like Jurassic Park. I felt as though everyone involved in Deep Blue Sea copied every frame by frame, shot by shot from Jurassic Park and slapped it together to create this. Even though it isn't Jurassic Park the whole movie does suspiciously feels like I'm watching Jurassic Park. But the crew behind Deep Blue Sea thought to themselves that his is a new original idea, but it's clearly obvious that you copied everything from Jurassic Park. The other thing is that this movie is all over the place as we have our scientist characters and LL Cool J who is the cook on the facility. I'm not sure whether LL Cool J was in the right movie or maybe it was the scientist because the movie switches between the scientists and LL Cool J that takes the fun out of the suspense and gets lost and confused along the way. We have Michael Rapaport and LL Cool J who provide the comic relief of the movie, but it felt like one big comedy competition between these two instead of one person providing the comedy and the other one is here for the ride or just wondered into the wrong movie. I kept asking myself is this supposed to be a movie about sharks with LL Cool J or a movie about sharks with just the scientists? In the end however, I was on the sharks side as I had little empathy for either of these characters who reminded me of those people who try to be cool, but are obviously failing at it. Overall, I had such high hopes for Deep Blue Sea, but what we have here is an unfinished script that is clearly in need of polishing, special effects that definitely needed some improving, and a movie that does offer suspense, but feels like it has a mind of its own.",Deep Blue Sea

No, this isn't an oscar caliber movie nor is it likely to be one of you all time favorites, but come on, if you saw this on the big screen with the lights out and the SFX jammed to the max, are you going to tell me that you weren't the least bit scared?  Being a horror film buff, I am not scared that easily, but this movie scared the crap out of me.  Not so much as the far superior Jaws did to me or hell, the entire population of the world, but Deep Blue Sea still had it's fair share of thrills and shocks.The thrills start the second Thomas Jane's character is swimming with a large tiger shark trying to get a license plate out of its mouth (nod to Jaws, perhaps?).  The rest of the movie is equally as gripping, just like other Renny Harlin movies (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), we have a disaster situation in a hostile environment with lethal bad guys trying to kill the innocent.  Yeah, there were a lot of unbelievable parts in it, but I find that unbelievability can be ignored (and ONLY ignored)when there is substance, in this movie's case, thrills and suspense.  I saw this in the theater and it literally had me on the edge of my seat...a rarity for me. Did it have a profound effect in scaring me to go back into the water? Nope, I lived on the beach for the better part of my life, and the only movie to ever do that to me was of course, Jaws.  But it did play on my biggest fears, namely fear of drowning and fear of being eaten alive.  And yeah, it is pretty obvious who will make it and who won't...but not all, and everyone who has seen this will know exactly what I'm talking about. There are two charcters in particular that I did not expect to see die, nor when they did, which made the film all the more shocking.Yeah this movie has its fair share of dumb moments, but it makes up for it with suspense and thrills.  I thought the CGI was quite good, though others have oddly complained about it.  They also used real mechanical sharks in some scenes which look really cool and are a welcome site in the era of relentless CGI.All in all, a pretty scary flick.  Read all of the negative reviews on this site you want...I'll agree with a lot of their points, but if you watch this one in the dark with the surround sound on max, then I will guarantee that you will be scared.  I think a lot of people may have caught this one on cable with all of the good parts edited out and in a room full of people that turned it into sarcastic fodder, and I probably would too if I were in that situation.

It does have some genuine shocks, it is fast moving and the premise isn't bad.The moral of the tale is very obvious. Do not mess with nature, nature will fight back. Three large ""smart"" mako sharks definitely do fight back.

The scientist character who thinks narrowly, and focuses solely on her desire to wipe out Alzheimers' without ever considering the dangers of the side effects she is creating by enhancing the brain of the shark. Yes, it is an obvious message, but how often has science done something because it could, without ever considering whether it should! Objections have been raised because the movie raises the profile of the shark in a very bad way. The shark is an animal, and it is made quite clear that the shark's desire is freedom, and to achieve that freedom, the sharks have worked out a plan. Which is a direct by-product of Dr Susan's experiments, so I really don't understand that argument. In the character of Carter Blake, the shark wrangler, you are offered a much more sympathetic view of the shark and it's natural motivations than in any other ""shark movie"" I have seen so far.You can accept this movie purely on the thrills and spills level, or you can see something a bit more thoughtful in it, which ever way you look at it, it isn't a bad way to spend an evening.",Deep Blue Sea

So asks Samuel L. Jackson in Renny Harlin's stupendous thriller ""Deep Blue Sea."" Franklin is one of seven people trapped beneath the ocean's surface. One of them has already died, and three unnaturally brilliant sharks are eager for more. The undersea laboratory is flooding, and wherever the water travels the sharks can follow.The movie opens when an escaped experimental shark attacks a 25 foot boat. The two couples aboard are saved from becoming fish chow at the last moment. The resulting publicity gives primary investor Russell Franklin (Jackson) cold feet about the safety of his money. He gives the scientists one final chance, and he needs to be present to satisfy his mind.Dr. Susan McCallister (a mildly de-beautified Saffron Burrows) is attempting to harvest enzymes found in shark brains for human benefit. Unfortunately, she can produce enough enzyme volume only by increasing the size of the three sharks' brains. When a medical emergency arises, the sharks seize their opportunity to breach the inner part of the facility. The survivors are Franklin, McCallister, Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), a shark wrangler; Jan Higgins (Jacqueline McKenzie), the medical assistant; Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport), the facility engineer; and Sherman Dudley (LL Cool J), the chef.One trait that elevates ""Deep Blue Sea"" above nearly every other hunter-and-hunted movie is its cleverness. The closest anybody comes to stupid is when they spend too much time looking at cracking glass. Harlin and the three writers never contrive situations for extra effect. We are warned about the risks each new area holds. Both the places the humans go and effects of the sharks' destruction are entirely reasonable and believable. When falling debris burns Carter's arm, he must bandage it to prevent his dripping blood from endangering the whole group. Sure, ladders break with characters on them, but those are natural occurrences considering the structural damage around them.Most of the tense parts do not even involve a device such as the breaking ladder. The humans spend a majority of their time in undamaged areas. By moving his camera underwater, Harlin provides a constant reminder than even those places are not safe. In fact, two of the decisive encounters occur in undestroyed areas.The layout of the structure is clearly explained. When the characters speak amongst themselves, we are reminded of the design without hearing them needlessly tell each other what they already know. No extra words are needed for us to follow their progress and thinking. When mere words are not sufficient, Harlin shows the speaker skim his finger over a floor plan. They discuss the pros and cons of each decision and always make the most intelligent one.The movie makes no attempt to conceal the sources of its plot. The chase around a facility with a shrinking safe area comes from the Alien movies and the end of ""Jurassic Park."" The idea of smart sharks is taken from ""Jaws."" Harlin borrows the ""shark vision"" camera from ""Jaws"" and composer Trevor Rabin makes his impending danger theme similar to John Williams'. The sharks die the same way as those from the Jaws trilogy. ""Deep Blue Sea"" does not rip off those films, but rather expresses great pride towards its inspirations. Harlin provides a new twist to their masterful ingenuity without plagiarizing it.The sharks are the main audience draw, but the humans remain the movie's true stars. Each has his or her own personality and reaction to traumatic events. They are not merely sources for lines that need to be spoken. They all have their strengths and drawbacks; every personal relationship carries its own dynamic. Higgins undergoes the most shock and Franklin takes responsibility for helping her along. Some characters undergo change, most notably Scoggins and Dr. McCallister.Burrows has the most difficult role. Watching her at the beginning of the movie and then skipping to the end will reveal two different people. That indicates successful acting. McKenzie's part is a close second on the difficulty scale, and she also evolves with the character. Samuel L. Jackson convinces us of Franklin's role of stability and authority. I agree with James Berardinelli; Jackson is one of the greatest actors working today. Jane and Cool J bring even more to their roles than would be satisfactory. Franklin and Carter are the rocks of the group and the two the others can least afford to lose.All of these elements are figuratively chapters 1-11 of the pre-marriage counseling book. The attacks themselves are chapter 12. Chapter 12 is the most fun and rewarding part of the marriage, but the prior lessons are what make it so special. The foundation is solid, and the ferocious shark scenes are even better. They come quickly and unexpectedly, and nobody is guaranteed to make it to the 100th minute. Harlin withholds opening credits to cast further doubt as to who will be next. Then, as soon as we think we have it all figured out, Harlin reveals that the sharks are even smarter than we imagined. ""Deep Blue Sea"" rates a nine of ten.",Deep Blue Sea

The sharks are smarter and meaner than those in Jaws, the biting scenes are more grisly, and the special effects are well-done.

It might have been because I do enjoy creature movies, so I failed to miss all the tell-tale signs that were there all along, pointing out just how dreadful Deep Blue Sea is. That was why I didn't act on the almost flawless premise that states that rappers are always bad actors, that CGI monsters never manage to impress much, and that this is a genre that isn't supposed to be a blockbuster.Now, what is wrong with this movie, apart from the generalities I have already mentioned...Pretty much everything. The goofs are too many to be numbered, and worse, are actually perceptible even to a not too alert viewer. I found myself rooting for the sharks, they clearly had the upper hand in terms of likability, the rest of the cast being inept, to say the least. Why did Samuel L Jackson feature in this is beyond me, his death scene being one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen. Of course, there is the matter of explaining how such huge sharks manage to swim in waist high waters, or how they are capable to swim backwards, etc etc. Even if we decide to let all these details go by unacknowledged the final product is dull, logic-less, poorly directed, atrociously acted and overall stupid. *Mild Spoiler* In one of the final scenes, when the cook is being dragged around by the shark, without actually dying, I wonder if the idea was to pay a tribute to Jaws IV in which something very similar happens. If so it would be a case of very bad movie pays homage to even worse flick. Oh the poetic justice of it all! *End spoilers*There is one saving grace in this movie and that is soundtrack and by that I mean the opening music. Sadly, by the time the credits start to roll, thus putting an end to this excruciating ordeal, we are greeted with yet another dose of rap. Of course. Anyone who found the opening musical sequence to be interesting might like to know that a metal band, Nightwish, made quite a remarkable cover of it, which I truly recommend.",Deep Blue Sea

I think the song is called Deepest Bluest and it is beyond dreadful and features some of worst lyrics known to man......'Deepest Bluest, my hat is like a sharks fin'....just stop LL Cool J",Deep Blue Sea

185,Charles-31,What a stinker...,2,22 August 2000,"This movie is about as bad as a big-budget horror flick can be.  It uses EVERY cliche in the book (well, I think they missed evil twins).  It is seriously bad.  The only redeeming factor is when S. L. Jackson gets eaten by the shark after delivering a speech almost directly out of Animal House. Thank you for shutting him up.  Worst of all is that I'm sure they didn't intend for it to be funny.  Do not waste your time or money!",Deep Blue Sea
186,Rhino Rover,A Thrilling Ride,8,31 July 1999,"I guess it's inevitable that this movie is compared to Jaws but that's not a bad thing is it? Besides, if you look hard enough, almost every movie bears some resemblance to a previous movie. I found this movie to be quite thrilling and at points terrifying.The storyline revolves around a researcher (Burrows) trying to determine the cure for Alzhiemer's. She's certain that she's discovered a cure but encounters a snag when one of the test sharks escapes the lab compound and has to be hunted down. As a result of the escaped shark, the funding company (represented by Jackson) threatens to put an end to the research if a cure is not found soon before the bad publicity threatens the stock value of the company. He visits the research facility and all hell breaks loose when a sudden storm blows in causing all kinds of problems. They soon discover that these sharks are not as dumb as they seem and what ensues is a carefully orchestrated feeding freenzy by the sharks.I found this movie to be amazingly fast paced. There is a lot of dialogue but it never seemed to slow down the movie. Albiet, some of the dialogue is rather corny but in general it was pretty good. Keep in mind, the dialogue in Jaws was never spectacular either. There were many unexpected situations that definately created a scare and added to the tension that the characters were feeling. There were some creative situations that lead to some entertaining action sequences and in the end, this movie accomplished it's objectives with flying colors. It entertained us. Of course, with movies if this type, the plot usually suffers gaping holes but nothing so significant that you become lost.LL Cool J's performance was mediocre but I suspect he'll get better as he finds roles more suited for him. This one didn't quite seem to be the right one but he does make good with what he's given. Saffron Burrows plays her role as the cold determined researcher well and Jackson does his usual good job. Thomas Jane plays the dashing shark hunter and plays it well. Some of his lines are a bit corny but this movie definately belonged to him.
The sharks were well done, although in some sequences, the special effects tended to fall apart. For those of you who don't know, most of the surface shots of the shark were performed by a radio controlled model shark (no cables) and I found the movements amazingly realistic. There were some very creative things done with the sharks and in the end what you're left with is a fun filled (some may say terrifying) ride. This is the second creature movie (Lake Placid) of the summer and I would recommend both. This one doesn't have the humor that Lake Placid has but makes up for it with graphic and shocking action shots. One note to parents, don't take your kids to this movie. This is not Flipper or Free Willy. There is nothing friendly about these sharks. I found some parents taking their kids (12 and under) to this movie and I thought that some of the scenes were much too graphic for children nonetheless adults. But, if you're an adult and you want a mindless but entertaining ride, then go see this movie.",Deep Blue Sea
187,DJ_Shilo,Smart Sharks,3,2 May 2020,"Since ""Jaws"" came out in 1975, shark movies have never lived up to the name, nor will they. It was a thrilling adventure with a complex puzzle, and it has stood the test of time. The newest shark movie, ""Deep Blue Sea,"" is devoid of anything smart, and the sharks are portrayed as slasher villains in a predictable, stupid story with characters who get set up to be shark food. We know this going into the movie, so there is no reason to be surprised. Speaking of the characters, one of them in this film is supposed to be the brains, but she turns out to be the film's biggest idiot, and that would be Saffron Burrows.It's about a scientist, Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows), who works in an underwater facility called Aquatica and she is attempting to discover a cure for Alzheimer's. Experimenting on Mako Sharks, she believes she has found a cure. When she discovers that the facility's funding will soon get cut off without results, she goes ahead and experiments on a shark. Unknowingly, she increases the Shark's brain mass, and as a side effect, the Shark gets smarter. After the test goes wrong and the crew finds themselves trapped, they turn to an experienced shark wrangler, Carter (Thomas Jane), to try and get out of the facility before the sharks get them.I wouldn't say this movie got made just for cash. It does have a production value to it, and some of the underwater sequences are cleary shot and fun to witness. One of the film's significant faults is the predictable screenplay, cliched story, and stupidity of scenes such as a shark swimming towards a glass window with a stretcher in its mouth that has a scientist strapped to it. You see the shark swim at full speed and then launch the stretcher at the window before it swims away. Not only does it look bad, but it's implausible. The Shark does this to start flooding the facility.It opens with kids partying on a boat when red wine or something gets spilled into the water, and they get attacked by a shark before Carter stops it. I would like to know how the Shark wrangler gets an aggressive Mako back to the lagoon it was held in from out in the middle of the ocean. Anyway, the sharks get studied for the potential cure. In comes, the token black guy played by Samuel L Jackson, who plays the billionaire funding Susan's research project. The sharks swim around in holding pens before she decides to go through with the experiment, and all hell breaks loose when the Shark awakens and attacks the doctor that ends up on the stretcher. My question is that there are three sharks, and only one is enhanced, so how are the other two also smart? Burrows is the reason for the chaos when she stupidly lowers the Shark back down into the water. Remember, I said she was an idiot? That's not the worst of her.Up until this point, the film is watchable, but when you see Sharks swimming backwards at the sight of a shotgun and picking off everyone with strategy, there's no point because it gets too stupid to comprehend. LL Cool J plays a cook who wanders around the flooded halls until he sees one of the sharks that chases him, quotes religion and sets it on fire. In one of the movies, more stupid and predictable moments, someone stands near a wet pool and starts going on about something he survived. The camera goes close upon his face, and we know he is going to get chewed, and he does. The Shark launches out of the wet pool to get him. You can quickly figure out who gets chomped.Saffron Burrows is the real problem of the film because you don't know if she is insane or stupid. None of the characters get developed because that would be smart. Burrows comes off as both, and her performance is bland. After everyone gets chomped, three characters make it to the surface, and you can figure out who they are. Carter is about the only good thing the movie has to offer. We know he is smart but, again, no development. When Carter tries to shoot the last Shark and misses, Susan attempts to attract it, and she says, ""I know how to get her"" before she cuts her hand and jumps in the water. After she gets told to ""get out of the water,"" she realizes how stupid she is and attempts to climb up the ladder when it magically breaks, and we saw that cliche coming. The Shark swims towards her, stops, rolls it's eyes up and waits for Carter to dive in the water to try to save her. As soon as he lands, the Shark chomps her to pieces. Think about that for a second.For a June release, It's a shark movie, so many will see it, and I have seen worse, but with the stupidity the film offers, it's not worth it. After a shark chomps one of the characters into an electrical panel and he gets shredded just because the screenwriters want to make it gruesome, I checked out, and that's about the halfway mark. There is no real reason to see it when you're going to be bored because there is nothing that will surprise you. Save your money and go to the beach instead.",Deep Blue Sea
188,Alan-40,Deep Blue Snore,3,3 November 2002,"Satisfying only for people who would be satisfied with special effects and nothing else.  Some good actors are wasted literally with a plot line that does not deserve them.

189,Yonhap S,cliched but very good,8,2 September 1999,"This is the most surprising movie I've seen in a long while.  The plot involves a group of scientists/researchers along with some human film fodder playing against nature in order to create the cure to Alzheimer's disease. The research also made the sharks smarter (though how smart that they could possibly know how to engineer an escape seem to go for disbelief). The characters all go through cliched moments but director Renny Harlin manages to pull in some nasty surprises.  Yes, there are predictable moments but there's also some unexpected twists.  The story as a whole is just okay, but it's Harlin's direction that's great about this movie.  Comparison with JAWS is unavoidable, Harlin even mentioned about making this shark movie in a way Spielberg wished he could have done.  Where Jaws is a shark that seems slowly swimming to its victim, the sharks in Deep Blue Sea are majestic yet deadly.  There's a part of me thinking Jurassic Park because the sharks are swift and deadly as Velociraptors.    And in a way, Harlin was probably right.The verdict: 4 of 5 stars",Deep Blue Sea

This movie blew me away. I didn't expect anything. It scared me right out of the seat. I loved the performances. The cast was great. The script was great. I loved the funny lines it threw in. I laughed while I screamed. The f/x were great. I love the part at the end when the shark gets blown up. That was a bloody mess. Really. I just can't believe it didn't make more at the box office. It was a complete surprise. I didn't think LL Cool J could act but he was the best in the movie. I will buy the DVD the first day of release. It's just one of those movies that don't come around often. If your looking for a scarey movie that's funny and full of f/x than see this. Deep Blue Sea: A+,Deep Blue Sea

I didn't like some of the things that occurred that are physically impossible both with the sharks, and with Thomas Jane's character at the end of the movie.

I felt guilty watching this because the female characters were so unlikeable-- I wanted them to buy it, first! Saffron Burrows is certainly easy on the eyes, but that's about the only praise I could give her-- the role required a more interesting actress, like Julianne Moore or maybe Angela Bassett. Thomas Jane was very charismatic and can use this film as a springboard to even bigger roles. If you can get past the dreadful first 20 minutes, the film kicks into high gear, moves well, and has the courage to give the audience exactly what it wants, while mixing in some surprises along the way. The shark attacks are shocking- one in particular, which had the audience screaming and laughing.

196,myspecialparadise,Cool Fool,7,17 August 2013,"I actually love this turkey with all the trimmings ... however, some of the acting sucks pimentos! Lets get too it. The camera shots were superb, which means that the camera men were top choice! Most of the special effects were totally righteous, with a few exceptions, such as the shark coming out of a hole sideways, and backing up through the same hole sideways with someone in its mouth. That part stank to high heavens! Plus, the out- takes should have never become out-takes ... they are too important to the movie! Well, except LL Cool J's religious ramblings! Casting was so-so, and could have been a lot better, and so could the directing of the film.Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson ... as always! And that is not always a good thing! LL Cool J was totally cool, except for the times he wasn't ... a cooking Preacher? I think not! Religious leaders are seldom good for anything other than preaching! Thomas Jane was an excellent choice for the part he played, he makes the movie. Actually, the only person that was out of place in the film was Saffron Burrows ... I think her looks played too much of a role in getting this part in the film. She wasn't convincing in the part. Jacqueline McKenzie was practically perfect in every way, as was Stellan Skarsgård. Michael Rapaport may have played his part too well, as he became annoying as all hell.As for the sharks ... thank God they're not real ... because, considering some of the insane things they were made to do in this movie, they're next accomplishment has to be walking out of the sea and attacking us in our beds! Be serious people ... I don't care how smart a shark is, there is no way they would know that glass is breakable, and, an aluminum gurney is not going to break through a glass window made of extremely thick glass for underwater use!

I thought it was bad 20 years ago but recently revisiting it just made me realise how older films got made and how bad they were.People making stupid decisions you wouldn't do in real life, then you get the typical comical black guy in the movie (obviously to please the young female attendes) that finds it funny to make crude racial jokes whenever be wants, oh you can't say anything as it's not racism...

Gets away. Gets actually attacked by shark? Oh low and behold it lets him go (not before he has done a weird preacher boy crap beforehand).Somehow they figured out that the sharks figured out the fences around the site were titanium at the bottom and steel up top. Erm yeh I'm sure we all knew a shark that attended science lessons at school and.learnt about strengths of different metals...Ok so to get the shark to not break out of the newly discovered steel fencing she needs bait...I know I will jump in and literally kill myself when we could actually let the shark get free and just like disappear?This film is sooo bad.

The sharks were awesome, and very freaky to add.  I really didn't like Saffron's performance, but Thomas Jane was pretty cool... he did a lot with his minimal lines, and it got the effect out.  I mean, he's just a quiet guy that likes to keep to himself and just happens to be a very good survivalist.  I think he portrayed that role very well.Other than that, I would recommend people who like action to go watch it. It kept me on the edge of my seats the whole time, like Armageddon.

200,DesertDogMedia,Deep Blue Sea,8,13 July 2014,"Title: Deep Blue SeaCondensed Storyline: A group of scientists are trying to cure brain cancer by experimenting on the brains of sharks, but one of the scientists genetically altered the brain of the sharks. So now the group are being chased through their sea lab by the genetically altered sharks. Notable Acting: With these movies, you can generally guess which characters are going to die and which are going to survive. The end result of this movie might surprise you as the people you don't expect to die, will die. Thomas Jane plays our protagonist called Cater, who is the standard BA character of the movie who we know will not be dying. So there is no need to worry about him. His role is good and fun to watch as we learn more about this character through his interactions to others. Saffron Burrowss is our secondary protagonist who ends up paying for her wrongs at the end of the movie, I can understand this character because she did what she thought was necessary to save the lives of millions. Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson, he is one of those actors like Nick Cage who can say they're a character but you don't see them as that character, you only see them as that actor. LL Cool J is also in this movie as the black Christian cook who's dialog is almost as stereotypical as possible, but at least I can see him as an actual character and not just an actor. The others are just secondary characters who have little dialog in most scenes, so logic of horror movies would dictate that they are going to die, so there is not point getting attached to the character. Noticeable Camera work: There is very little to no creative camera angle, it is just the standard close up, mid shots, panning shot, zoom in shots and all that. But they partially make it up by framing things nicely, an example would be just before they feed the tiger shark to the Mako sharks when Preacher is looking out of his window and the camera zooms in and goes through the window and shows us Carter swimming through the water. They used a bit of CGI for it, but it is still a nice little piece there. Another would be a dolly worms eyes shot were the camera is riding through the corridor and tilts up to the crew, that was nicely done and quite creative as well. Graphics: That CGI sharks in this movie are some of the best CGI sharks you'll ever see on the big screen. This is sad because the sharks in this movie resemble that of B-List horror movie sharks. Apparently it is so hard for a movie with a budget of $60,000,000 to create good CGI sharks, chances are they spent most of that money and the sets and actors. Because TV documentaries such as 'Walking with Dinosaurs' can make realistic looking dinosaurs with a budget of only £6,000,000. Not to mention 'Walking with Dinosaurs: Sea Monster Special' which mixes CGI dinosaurs with live action filming, with a suspected lower budget, the lower budget makes them still realistic, but to a lesser extent. But my point is that big budget movie should focus as much money on the monster of the movie as they do with the actors. Incorrect Science: Teddy bears are made of wool and cotton, so the one shown in the beginning scene shouldn't have sank that quickly, if at all. The shark shown to be a tiger shark in the beginning of the movie look nothing like a tiger shark, it has similar markings to one, but the head is incorrectly made as tiger sharks have blunt noses and odd shaped teeth. The one in this movie has a pointed nose and sharp teeth. Carter Blake rubs the body of a shark back and forth with his bare hand, anyone who has touched shark skin would know that shark skin isn't smooth, if it look at shark skin through an electron microscope, you would see that it is comprised of tiny jagged scales. These allow the shark be hydrodynamic and swim through the water with ease. At the pace that Carter was rubbing, his hands would be bleeding. Susan kills one of the sharks by electrocuting it in the water, she then looks to her research data floating in the water, is looks burnt from the electricity from the water. This is incorrect as the electric charge wouldn't fry the paper or the floppy disk. Overall Feel: Production value of an A-list movie with the CGI of a B-list movie makes this film a low level A- list movie. I also need to say that I love this movie, it is also one of my favourite monster/creature feature movies, this may not seem apparent from the amount of criticism I give the movie. But regardless of its many flaws I love this movie to death, along with its plot and characters, no matter how far fetched the plot may be. You can tell this movie is old though, mainly because they are still using floppy disks in their computers. The 2 minute trailer for this movie gives you a run down of the movie and ultimately sold the movie to me and is still one of the best shark movies to this day (In my opinion, before the Jaws fans attack me)",Deep Blue Sea
201,mbworm,Frankly what can you expect?,6,18 March 2008,"""Deep Blue Sea"" is entertaining for what it is, a tongue in cheek horror film. Although ""Lake Placid"",(the other big budgeted creature feature from the same time) had a hilarious black humor/satire feel to it, ""Deep Blue Sea's"" biggest fault is the amount of seriousness with which it takes itself. How can you truly believe that scientists have found the cure for Alzheimers stored in protein in shark's brains? Well that's what this movie tries to convince the audience.Unbelievable and hokey plot aside, ""Deep Blue Sea"" knows that it's not THAT smart so it doesn't try to push that idea too much. Instead, after the sharks outsmart the scientists and begin to flood ""Aquatica"", the floating steel structure where the labs are in the middle of the ocean, we get about an hour and twenty minutes of brutal shark attacks and brain dead survivors trying to make it to the surface before the building sinks and the sharks eat everybody for dinner.It's so preposterous that it's wholly enjoyable. The animatronic/CGI sharks look rather obviously and dramatically fake in some scenes but for the most part they're hidden under water and it works well. When they kill people it's truly surprising and scary, most notably the scene in the elevator shaft when... well I won't ruin it for you, but there's plenty of blood and scares to racket up the tension until the big finale at the surface, which is the best part of the film.Renny Harlin has made a stupid but enjoyable underwater thriller that is miles above such crap like ""Anaconda"" and the countless direct to video (or Sci Fi channel) underwater predator thrillers.

204,Sharkey360,Very good!,8,13 December 1999,"Deep Blue Sea is usually mistaken as a Jaws imitator. Well, the similarities between Jaws and DBS are the shark presence, sea water and suspense of being with a shark. Aside from that, DBS is actually different from Jaws. For one thing DBS has a bit of science in it (tampering with the sharks is one interesting topic), and best of all has many jumpy and/or shocking scenes for those of you who want something different from a shark film. Samuel L. Jackson is the  2nd biggest star in the film and his character is the most lively of them all...except that his presence was short. The rest of the cast are kinda less-lively but the film's high entertainment value will surely ignore that. The biggest star here is actually shared...by the sharks of course. You get to see how smart, fast and furious these sharks can be when one plays the role of God over them. Hence, every creation can rebel against its creator and this was very evident in the film!It seems that DBS was some sort of a desperate effort by Renny Harlin to get back to the box-office form he had with Die-Hard 2. The film just is not long enough for me, and I felt that Harlin could have done more to make this film a certified blockbuster.

Consequently, the sharks are able to do lots of neat stuff that they can't in real life and those boring nature-documentary watchers can't whine about it - ha ha!!!The smart babe-scientist then puts the sharks in easily-escapable pens at sea, in a flimsy sea-rig and waits for a storm to brew up.The sharks take the first opportunity to eat people and basically we are then in predictably safe ""guess-the-next-victim"" territory.  (The rules to this game are:  ""Well, he can't get eaten because he's the handsome loner, but HE will get eaten because he's just the comic relief, SHE won't get eaten because she's a babe, but that old chick is a goner"" and so forth).Except we're NOT, because this movie isn't as dumb as it looks.  It turns at least one giant-killing-machine-on-the-loose movie cliche ON IT'S HEAD. Leaving not only the audience but the ACTORS IN THE MOVIE AS WELL kind of pointing and going, ""Wuh?  Huh?  Nuh???  They can't do THAT!!!!!""  The whole movie is worth it for that moment alone, the moment being when....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!!!!!  THEY GOT ME!!!!  THEY GOT MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!Ha ha!  Just kidding!  Anyway, this film is a lot of fun - the sharks are scary, the script has enough jokes in it to let you know that no-one is really taking it seriously and there are NO Jedi knights in it.",Deep Blue Sea

The horrible dialogue spewed out in a frantic race to tie up loose plot threads before the ""terrifying"" finale move beyond the cute sort of ""how dumb"" realm and into the ""how stupid can you get?!?"" world of eye rolling and head scratching.

209,eternalsea,Enjoyable Shark romp,7,18 March 2006,"Deep blue sea is without a doubt the best Shark film since Jaws. Since Jaws Shark films have been generally poor with the jaws sequels and lame shark attack movies proof of that. Deep blue sea does buck that trend but it itself is no classic, rather a mildly intelligent hunk of fun. The story whilst not completely cardboard is pretty simple, A group of researchers are testing on sharks in the hope of curing alzimers. They are doing their testing in a marine labratory and Samuel L Jacksons character has come to check up on their research. Disaster strikes and the sharks break into a flooded research centre and the group attempt to escape. The acting is average at times worse, but that is not what we've come to see the film for. It's the sharks and they are nasty and very cool looking. They have become super intelligent through testing and are maybe the deadliest we have ever seen on screen. The film has faults but it remains highly entertaining and is an effective thriller in its way.",Deep Blue Sea

It's just so much to watch.Basically, in the middle of the ocean..hundreds of miles away from anything..you have a special scientist lab to experiment on sharks. You have people doing experiments on them to change the way their brain cells think. Trying to make sharks think differently and make them smarter etc. For example, the whole plan was to make the sharks smarter, meaning, they wouldn't mistake seals for humans and wouldn't come near humans ever again. But, unfortunately, instead, it was the opposite, the sharks got smarter on how to catch and kill the human. The whole plan backfired.Now, in the middle of the sea, in the middle of nowhere. These sharks break into the scientist lab and the whole lab is now flooded with water and they are all now racing to stay one step ahead of these 3 sharks.The acting (especially from LL Cool J) is really good. Not the best acting ever, but definitely real and incredibly down to earth.And I have to say this now, it had the most original ending i've possible ever seen. Finally, a film where all the women die and a film where a black man survives! That, to me, is just fantastic, cause you hardly ever see that. I give Deep Blue Sea 8/10.",Deep Blue Sea

""It's kinda Jaws meets Alien meets 28 Days Later"" drawls Finland's answer to Michael Bay, Renny ""The Marlin"" Harlin; ""Kinda, Samuel L meets uber-babe meets blond surfer dude meets wacky ship's cook with these cool one liners"" he adds redundantly as the next Woody Allen Project is quietly shelved and the studio's finance director reaches for his corporate cheque book. Who said modern cinema was formulaic? On the bright side, such sparse imaginative furnishing does leave room for putting ones feet up, getting in some popcorn-related girth enlargement, and deriving passing amusement from betting on who is gonna get scragged next.And, believe it or not, working out who is live bait is no mean task, mainly due to a moment of inspired plotting early on, where a prominent member of the cast is sent for a figurative and literal early bath. Streuth, is no one sacred.The plot? Ho, hum. Well, let's call it a premise rather than a plot. Marine-based scientists developing a cure for Alzheimer's genetically engineer huge, hyper-intelligent, hyper-aggressive mako sharks for ooh, something or other. Hey, what could happen next?! Can someone smell fish? Actually Deep Blue Sea is not that bad for a brainless action movie. Harlin the Marlin at least copies effectively; so while the audience may be forcibly reminded of Alien, it could be a lot worse - it could be being reminded Alien Resurrection. Harlin also keeps us on tenterhooks with some well-paced action interspersed with a totally gratuitous  yet very welcome  shot of Saffron Burrows stripping down to her grundies. Once the fan has proverbially been hit, the audience finds out lots of lovely things about various cast members, which keep us at least half on the side of the tooth team; all things considered, just as well. Chomp, chomp.So it depends what you want. Big it may be, but Deep Blue Sea is certainly not clever. Jaws was based on Enemy of the People; Deep Blue Seawell, isn't. On the positive side, the sharks are lovely (no floating rubber in this film); the action is well paced and there is a certain, knowing, disaster movie tongue in cheek.

219,Movieguy-47,An Anticipated Disappointment,5,30 July 1999,"Renny Harlin's highly-anticipated ""Deep Blue Sea"" turns out to be nothing more than an action-packed bore, a rather tired hybrid of ""Jaws,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" and ""Alien.""A pretty scientist on an offshore research facility has been experimenting with mako sharks, making them larger and much smarter, in order to cure a brain disease. Unfortunately, the nasty sharks escape, do their best to destroy and flood most the facility, and then go after the humans. Along for the ride (or the lunch tray) is Thomas Jane as shark expert Carter Blake, Samuel L. Jackson as the funder of the project, LL Cool J as a bible-quoting cook named Preacher, and Stellan Skarsgard as an eccentric scientist.The film was directed by Renny Harlin, the guy who made ""Die Hard 2,"" the best in that series, the vastly underrated ""Cutthroat Island,"" and the crowd-pleaser ""The Long Kiss Goodnight."" I'm not surprised that he took on ""Deep Blue Sea,"" and I guess I'm not too surprised he devoted more time to action than the much-needed terror.While there are a few undeniable jumps, in my opinion ""Deep Blue Sea"" is too violent to build up any real suspense, its material is blatantly unoriginal, and would it have killed the filmmakers to tell us a little bit of something about these characters before they started to kill them off one by one?

Researchers (led by Saffron Burrows and the awesome Stellan Skarsgard) on a base off the coast of Mexico have found a way to cure Alzheimer's through shark brains. Slight side effect, it means you get clever sharks that have worked out how to escape their cages.What follows is basically your standard horror/action piece where there are some gory deaths and acts of brazen stupidness and of course obligatory stripping on the part of Burrows.

Miserable film: no horror, no comedy, no motivation for the audience to watch. The horror concept we're told from the start, that the captive sharks have become intelligent, but from that point on the sharks look like any other sharks attacking people whether they're intelligent fish or not. And how many times can one watch that same special effect, where we see the victim being carried away in the shark's jaws at terrific speed? The scientific research angle, to cure Alzheimer's, would have been provocative science fiction, but it just gets thrown away as soon as the sharks escape. The characters seem interesting, but when some of them get picked off in the middle of the film the audience members who were focusing on those characters are left dangling. Some other films come to mind in which significant characters die in the middle of the story: Alien, Against All Odds, remake of Cat People, and most unbelievably, The Year of Living Dangerously.Might have become something if they'd worked on the story a while longer, tying the horror into the science the way Michael Crichton did in his original novel version of Jurassic Park.

But, I HAVE seen the title in question. When I was 9 years old, we had the best cable provider ever. A cable provider that came with a channel called HBO Zone. It was all the good, R-Rated movies that your parents forbid you to watch. I was awestruck. All those movies. At my disposal. Anyway, I digress. A film came along called Deep Blue Sea. A shark movie. I was nothing more than excited to see a movie that had sharks, babes, and...Thomas Jane! I'll tell it to you like it is. The film was amazingly cliché-ridden and poorly written. It's as if the writers of the film were sitting at home watching Jaws drunk off there asses taking another toke of the pipe when they thought of the cure for Alzhiemer's and decided to put it into a script. Only instead of miraculously curing Alzehiemers, they cured abso-friggen-loutly nothing. I think the only amazingly amazing thing in this movie was when Samuel L. Jackson gets ripped apart by a shark during one of his drawn out, uninspiring, and poorly acted speeches. I'd jump into the Pacific Ocean and get my ass eaten just to shake hands with a shark for that scene.Of course, the movie had it's good parts. Like when Saffron Burrows took off her wet suit. Of course, there was a bra-and-panty issue but it was still Jack Hoff Material. Michael Rapaport as a scientist and technological expert was very uncomfortable, but watching him cower like Rain Man after watching Jackson get pwned was a giggle-moment for me. Stellan Sarsgard was the only amazing actor in this film, and he got shot through plate glass AFTER getting his arm bitten off. Did someone shout ""Unwanted Overkill""? I think so. And the woman from The Sopranos getting blown up was the second most funniest thing I've ever seen in a shark movie. Thomas Jane wasn't that bad. And when he wasn't slipping, falling, and jumping into things, he was delivering a plethora of action hero lines in that deep Southern accent that we all love. But the worst part ever? Having LLCOOLJ in the movie and then playing two of his songs at the end that had a backdrop similar to the movie. Kinda like the theme songs to cheap, Direct-to-Store Disney videos that your kids beg you for but never watch. It was a bad addition and it made me want to kick LLCoolJ for actually agreeing to write it. BAD LLCJ! BAD! All in all, the movie wasn't bad, not great, not good, not even decent, but not bad. I give the movie a big, wet 6 for poor direction, sloppy writing, but some great themes and action moments that left me going ""Did you Blippin see that blip!?"" If you haven't seen it, good.

I've read over 600 different movie user's comments.....and I've never, ever been so surprised at people's reactions! For the most part, people love this movie!  HOW!?!  This is the most typical, cookie-cutter, Hollywood-style movie I've possibly ever seen! This movie is for people with the IQ of about 2!  One of the few people who did write a comment to say it was horrible was my own brother!  I agree with him on this one, and we don't normally agree on movies.  Read his too if you get a minute (same last name).I could go on and on and on about how ridiculous some of the parts in this movie are.  On most movies, I can overlook details that may not necessarily be true.  For example, for the movie ""Waterworld"", one user wrote that he thought the movie was horrible because if all the ice caps melted, there would still be lots of land on Earth and the drinking water would be so diluted that it would be drinkable (in the movie, it is saltwater).  I mean, SO WHAT!!  That stuff is trivial and can be easily overlooked, especially for science-fiction.  But some parts in this movie are so ridiculous, I nearly turned off the TV in complete disgust that people were paid to write and act for this crap!  I could get started on how someone escaped being eaten by the world's most ferocious shark WHILE ALREADY BEING IN THE SHARK'S MOUTH!!  Or how you could simply run away from an ocean's worth of water charging at you at a tremendous rate of speed, you know, like your buddy was chasing you or something!!  But no, the part that absolutely kills me, just sends me over the edge with stupidity, is this: scientists (or oceanographers, whichever), are attempting to increase brain mass in sharks by injecting the sharks with some type of drug.  While explaining this to Sam Jackson, the woman says, and I unbelievably quote, ""There was one side affect, and that is the sharks got smarter""!  UH, DUH!!  What the heck were they increasing brain mass for, if they didn't intend the sharks to get smarter?!?  To make them more handsome with a larger sized head?!?  COME ON!!!  I thought the ""side affect"" was what they were hoping for in the first place!  That's like taking a penis enlargement pill, then saying ""Doc, there was only one side affect, my penis got larger""!!  Absolutely stunning in it's stupidity!!According to most of the other user comments, nobody else must have caught that!  Simply ridiculous.Believe me, there are other parts just as bad.  I could type forever I think.  Just do yourself a favor, if you like movies that don't expect the average viewer to be a complete moron, then skip this title!

I thought Saffron Burrows was good and I dont see why she has been critisised so much, I hope this bad press doesnt affect her career as I would like to see more of her in the future.

Jaws is ""Finding Nemo"" on the scare-scale compared to this,but unlike Nemo,Jaws is a total BORE-FEST! I wish it had no offensive language,but it does.Though not to the extant of so many of the films today. Wow, I was so ""on edge"" after watching this,that I had to wind down a bit by playing a word game on my computer before going to bed,LOL! Intense,""VERY"" INTENSE!If you enjoy having the BE-JEEBERS scared out of you,go for it,LOL! I must warn you,THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS! The violence of the shark attacks are extremely GRAPHIC. I really also loved the story in this movie,very interesting and different,premise. Have fun!",Deep Blue Sea
239,lita-ann88,"Trust, this IS a great movie!",7,11 August 2018,"I don't understand the flack this film endures, I think it's an excellent, entertaining film. When labeled a ""stupid, crap movie""....by it's audience, not sure what they're expecting from it?It's well written, understandable story line, gory when it needs to be. The shock value is wonderfully put together, good acting. It's a shark film people, not an epic drama blockbuster! It does everything it needs to do and if not dissected by its audience, but simply enjoyed for what it is, you will sit back and have a great time with this movie.",Deep Blue Sea
240,Laner,Not bad...,7,12 January 2000,"But not a great movie by any means - another summer popcorn muncher along the lines of Independence Day (or any Will Smith flick for that matter). The two brothers (or is that bruthas?) are the only characters worth watching.  A shame that Jackson had so little screen time, but at least it was an unexpected plot twist.  Saffron Burrows looks good in wet underwear, but can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.",Deep Blue Sea
241,Critic-46,Deep Blue Sea review,6,3 August 1999,"Deep Blue Sea reviewMovie rated on 10 point scale. Divided into ten categories. If movie is good in a particular category, then it gets a 1 if not it gets a 0.Story - 1. Intriguing. Scientists, in a desperate search for the cure to a decease, must save their own lives, when the sharks they are testing on, escape.Characters - 0. I didn't care about any of the characters, because they were never given enough time to develop.Acting - 0. The acting was lacking all around. Everybody seemed to have that, ""Oh my God, i'm in a shark movie"" look.Cinematography - 1. Everything from the action scenes to the deep sea lab was gorgeously shot. Even the CGI sharks looked good.Beginning - 1. Wasted no time diving right into the story and introducing the main characters. It started off as an intriguing and promising box office hit.End - 0. Since most of the people I was rooting for died early in the film, I really didn't care about the survivors. Also the last action scene was a serious disappointment compared to some of the other action scenes.Believability - 1. What I respected about this film is that unlike other horror films, nobody tried to be a hero or did anything too stupid to jepordize their lives. When the sharks broke into the lab, NOBODY wasted anytime attempting to escape.Attention holding - 1. When the action begins, don't leave your seat, because you may miss some pretty cool shark attacks.Memorable - 0. There are one or two scenes that you probably won't forget anytime soon, but right after I left the theater, I could hardly remember anything else.Could Watch Again - 1. Not at the movies, but when it comes to DVD, I will probably rent it to show to my friends.Total - 6 out of 10. Could have been better for an 80mil. budget.",Deep Blue Sea

So unpredictable, right?! Of course.And sacrifices her self to the shark!!! Boo-Hoo! And some blonde guy keeps acting heroic and a stupid blonde, named Janet, moans because some guy named Jim dies when his arm was bitten off! Overall, it is an super!!! action packed thriller!!! 10/10 stars!!! the cgi and mechanical sharks are better than the Jaws one!!! Yay! I think this is one of the best shark attack films ever made!!! You should rent this great film!!! I will never forget this movie!!! It's just so great!!!Of course, 10/10 stars!!!",Deep Blue Sea

This could be his best.It is not just the sharks that are the star of this fast-moving film, it is many other things--The excellent acting by the cast(with the exception of LLCoolJ who is likable but can't act), the CGI Sharks,the great musical score, and the amazing sets of this film make you really feel the claustrophobia, and the constant menace of the sharks and the water everywhere, adding to the fear of drowning as well'This is an exciting film with many surprises, and you will have a fun time watching it",Deep Blue Sea
244,driffma,So wonderfully bad,1,26 August 2001,"I have given this film the rather low rating of one.  Which of course means that it is truly an awful film.  Having said that though, I will say that I whole heartedly recommend it.  It is in no way mediocre.  It is spectacular in its descent into awfulness.  It can never tell if it wants to be camp or a serious thriller.  As such it gives us scenes in where the story is taken far to seriously, and other scenes that have taken a clue from such recent fair as Scream.  I don't know what the hell the makers of this film were thinking but they managed to produce a horrible film that is absolutely fun to watch.  So pop up some popcorn, sit back with some witty friends and then pop in this movie.  It will provide a good bit of amusement.",Deep Blue Sea

Jackson is the only cool actor in this movie, and he dies!!...What!? The effects are okay, in my opinion. The sharks look real enough for me to believe it.The story starts off interestingly enough also, but then it takes a dive(no pun intended).First, the sharks take down a guy being lifted to a helicopter, then swim real fast at some glass, let the guy go, and the momentum causes him to break the glass....What!? That wouldn't happen! he'd just lightly tap the glass. Momentum doesn't work that way! Plus, the shark is some how not pulled into the room that had the glass broken...Huh!? Some thing else that really gets me in the flesh, is how the sharks have the opportunity to kill the blonde guy like ten different times!! And they never do!!",Deep Blue Sea
246,Fletch-35,One great horror film,10,30 July 1999,"This movie blows Jaws out of the water and leaves a bloody trail behind it. I didn't expect to much from this movie walking into it, and it started off a bit slow. But after awhile, this film turned into a totaly explosive action/horror film. The sharks are amazing and believable. The story is there, but as with most chasing slasher films, it isn't really needed. So with that aside, lots of action and bloody half human remains and loads of water, a few dramatic places and one death you'll defenitly cheer for because, well face she deserved to die (you'll know who it is when you see the film). One great flick. 10 out of 10.",Deep Blue Sea
247,catalog,Entertaining popcorn movie,7,29 July 1999,"A mix of Jaws, Jurassic Park, Aliens, and countless other similar movies, Deep Blue Sea is a pretty dumb, but thoroughly entertaining movie.  Who doesn't want to see sharks eating people?  Not only that, but this movie has one of the biggest surprises in recent movies.  I won't reveal it, of course, but I genuinely didn't see it coming. The biggest fault of the flick is the CG Sharks.  They look pretty fake in most scenes.  The animatronic sharks are flawless, however. Other than an over-reliance on slow-motion, there isn't much bad to say about the movie.  It was entertaining, and as long as you don't expect anything cerebral, you won't be disappointed.",Deep Blue Sea
248,alangiruk,Good Fun. Enjoy it.,5,18 March 2003,This is a stupidly entertaining movie.  My only criticism would be the casting of LL Cool J. It is typical of Hollywood to have a token black man who happens to be an ex con; turned man of God; carrying a large Crucifix around his neck; giving us quotes from the Bible. Pleeeassee! How many times have seen that before. Look past that and it is an enjoyable popcorn flick.,Deep Blue Sea

Renny Harlan, who hasen't done anything cool since ""The Long Kiss Goodnight,"" is at his worse and gets truly lame performances out of Samual L. Jackson and Micheal Rappaport. Also, if you think about it, the actions of the sharks make no sense.  At least ""Jaws"" on it's own level made sense, but this film doesn't make sense on any level.  And the sharks looked totally fake, ""Jaws"" seemed more realistic.  I really wish Hollywood would stop using such crappy computer effects and go back to models. The only good part about this film was looking at Saffron Burrows.",Deep Blue Sea

Bad dialogue, too many plot holes, and most of the plot they had was ludicrous BUT I loved this film. The actors did an extraordinary job at their roles and the action was really well done.  Renny Harlen is one of the best action movie directors around.  It even scared me and I have seen hundreds of horror movies.  The sharks seemed so real.

254,Nick_Milligan,Shallow Red Sea,5,23 May 2000,"This movie has some things going for it. Like amazing shark effects. But when it comes down to it, this film is literally Jurassic Park under water. Nothing in this movie is subtle. They have tried in no way to slightly change the basic plot and it sticks out like a sore thumb. I think this movie should have simply been called 'Gratuitous Footage of Shark Attack victims'. The majority of the characters are unlikable and forgettable. It is far-fetched movie, with ridiculous occurences which leave you crying, ""That would never happen!!"" The impression I get from this movie, is that they wanted to cram as many shark killings as they could into a movie. They have manipulated the movie so they can have as many people die as possible, in bloody ways. Plus, this movie takes itself way too seriously. The ending is ridiculous and the characters are unbelievable. As I said before, the only thing going for this movie is brilliant shark effects. Its worth watching to see them. 5 out of 10",Deep Blue Sea
255,Daff-4,Tori Spelling in a wading pool would have been more frightening than this,3,20 February 2000,"If you'd like to know whether you'd enjoy this film, just ask yourself the following question -""Do you find the idea of genetically engineered 'super sharks' that can read maps, make plans, analyse architectural data, disable security systems, and YET (when convenient) fail to distinguish between a human being and a fire extinguisher, frightening or just plain stupid?""I opted for the latter.I certainly didn't expect much from this film.  All I wanted was a few slightly suspenseful scenes, a decent line or two and some great visuals. I didn't even get that.The main problem with the film (and it really is hard to pick out a 'main' one) was this - sharks are scary for 2 reasons:(a)  they're big, dumb, killing machines; and(b) they live in the ocean  a place that they are well adapted to, and that we are not.Deep Blue Sea did its very best to destroy these principles.  For a start, the sharks were smart.'  Maybe it's just me, but the idea of a clever, scheming shark, carefully plotting my downfall, doesn't scare me  it makes me giggle.  A lot of this stems from the fact that they don't have HANDS. Every time they do something clever, they have to execute it with their noses  eg: butting open doors, ramming into cameras etc  it's not terrifying, it's comical.Secondly, the sharks are taken out of their element and placed inside a flooded building.  There is NOTHING scary about watching a fin hoon up and down a corridor and jump out from behind doors etc.  It's just silly.
The other significant problem was that the script was aimed at ten year olds.  Let me give you some examples (without giving away any of the 'plot') -(1) We are told (in one particularly memorable scene) that the sharks' brains contained a substance that could help cure Altzheimers disease.  To get more of the substance, the team spends millions of dollars genetically altering the sharks to increase the size of their brains (of course, it would have been much easier just to breed LOTS of the sharks, but what the hell - lets concentrate on making 5 or 6 of them huge).
Anyway, the team is 'shocked' to discover that a ""side effect"" of increasing the sharks' brains is that they become more intelligent.  Side effect???? Side effect????  Surely this is a DIRECT effect?  You're telling me they didn't even SUSPECT something like that might happen?  Just where did these 'scientists' get their degrees?(2) At the start of the film, the scientists demonstrate how the 'substance' cures Altzheimers.  Now, you'd expect the use of some sophisticated technology here.  The substance would need to be extracted, modified, purified, mixed with other substances, bombarded with radiation or heat maybe, and finally administered to a patient.Or at least, you'd THINK so wouldn't you?   But no.  In this film, they just stick a syringe into a live shark's head, extract some goo and then squeeze it onto a diseased piece of brain.  I mean, for God's sake!  Even an IMBECILE must know that cures for diseases are rarely just sucked out of an animal and then 'sprayed' onto the sick and dying.I KNOW this isn't meant to be an intelligent film and I'm just meant to appreciate it for the action and the effects, but did it have to be THIS dumb.(3)   Probably the single dumbest aspect of the script (an award which was fiercely contested) was the way in which sharks were caught early in the film.  5 sharks are kept in a big underwater cage.  Every now and then they need to catch one and drain the goo from their brain.  Now, this is a multi-million dollar facility and some of the world's finest minds have supposedly had a part in planning it.  So how do they go about catching a one?  A guy swims in with the killer sharks (and we're not talking about a one off here, this is standard procedure'), narrowly avoids getting killed and at the last moment pokes a tranquilising dart into them.  Come on!  Who thought of that?!?!?  At one point they even show off' this technique to investors in the project.  They all sit around nervously twiddling their thumbs and watching the 50/50 outcome `and.he made it!  Woo hoo!  That Sir, is the way we go about catching the sharks.  We lose a guy every couple of weeks, but it's the best method we've come up with.  So, do you want to invest in our project?'
Some other, more specific comments :the effects weren't bad, but weren't nearly good enough to compensate for the abysmal scriptthe film is never, ever scary or suspensfulLL Cool J (who played Comic Relief') cannot act AT ALL.
Saffron Burrows (who plays the standard stunningly gorgeous marine biologist who, when the going gets tough, gets her gear off) obviously learnt everything she knows about acting from LL Cool J
Jacqueline McKenzie's character was DREADFUL.  I've never wanted to see someone get eaten more than her (and she was playing a good guy').even Samuel Jackson couldn't rise above the rubbish that was written for him.All in all, this film is a disgrace.  If you haven't seen it, please DON'T. It's time people (myself included) stopped ponying up the dough on films like this and FORCED film makers to come up with better scripts.",Deep Blue Sea

The original Jaws was one hack of a scary movie (could it be because I was young???).  This movie fails miserably in trying to create the same level of suspense/horror.But it is not fair to judge this movie by comparing it with the best.  So I will look at this movie by itself.Weak plot, no character development, mindless gratutitous gory fast scene to generate scare.

Although this is your typical ""Alien"" rip-off, the movie does a great job of making you guess who's gonna get munched next because of the absence of big-name actors (save Samuel L. Jackson). But don't get me wrong...this movie isn't spectacular. There are some BIG holes in the plot...not to mention the bodies. And I didn't think there were enough characters left after the initial disaster. Also, the characters and dialogue are pretty one dimensional and sometimes really corny. BUT the movie looks great. The sharks are amazing...although the CGI sharks aren't as good as the mechanical ones. However, the movie did it's job in keeping things claustrophobic and tense, and it's one of Renny Harlin's better films. I give it ** 1/2.",Deep Blue Sea

Cool J in a rubber raft) to a go-for-the-throat (or torso for that matter) ending that left me smiling from ear to ear. In my opinion the movie just jumped from ** 1/2 to ***.,Deep Blue Sea

It has chills, thrills, good scares, good suspense, and a sense of claustrophobia and the feeling of no-turning-back.  Yeah, you can't help but think of Jaws when you see this, but simply because both are shark movies.  Deep Blue Sea is far different than Jaws, and far more scarier and thrilling.  The movie is about a doctor (Saffron Burrows, played very well) who uses sharks to increase their brain size to create a pill to cure Alzheimers.  Well, long story short, the sharks (three test sharks in all) escape and wreak revenge on the doctor and her co-workers.  Throughout the movie, there are plenty of good and fresh scares, good kill scenes, and great action.  Great acting all around.  And to not spoil anything, expect the unexpected.

266,keithanddeenie,The Poseidon Adventure and Frankenstein - but with sharks.,5,12 July 2000,"I found two benchmarks for Deep Blue Sea.  At times it was The Poseidon Adventure - but with sharks - and at others it was Frankenstein - but with sharks.  My greatest criticism of the movie concerns willing supsension of disbelief.  No one who has ever dropped a fishing line into the water (and that includes most of us, I'd wager) would do other than shake their head violently to ""no"" or laugh out loud when fed a tale about a 45-foot long mako shark.  No one has ever sighted (much less caught) a great white shark that size, and any fisherman can tell you that a mako is the great white's runt cousin.  That would be the greatest ""fish that got away"" story ever told.  In this case, it is a ""fish no one could get away from"" story.  Part of the fun of Deep Blue Sea, for myself at least, was tagging the victims before something put the bite on them.  Mostly I was right, but not always. The human would-be fish food spent most of the film doing the Poseidon Adventure stroke up and away from danger.  And as advertised, these were smart fish, courtesy of a Dr. Frankenstein experiment gone wrong.  So there you have it.  It's not much on concept, but Deep Blue Sea does provide plenty of excitement.  Samuel L. Jackson, the most recognizable name amongst the cast, goes mostly wasted, but Saffron Burrows looks great in her underwear.  As a glib action hero, Richard Jane is heroic and resourceful enough.  He bears a faint resemblance to Kevin Costner and he sounds a bit like Mel Gibson.  I'm uncertain whether those attributes help or hinder.  LL Cool J probably gives the best performance of the entire cast.  He's funny but he doesn't distance himself from his predicament.  In other words, he seems natural enough.  It's an entertaining movie.",Deep Blue Sea
267,Martin-242,Better than jaws,8,7 July 2000,I thought Deep Blue Sea was a great movie it was very exciting and entertaining. It had a good story and good acting for an action movie.

Also I think deep blue sea is way more entertaining than Jaws. 8/10,Deep Blue Sea
268,solebanana,Shark shocker lacks raw power of Jaws - partial spoiler,6,6 August 2001,"Briefly, the sharks concerned due to unlikely causes have been souped up to be more intelligent than your average shark, sort of bionic sharks. You can just see the meeting on this - ""It'll be like jaws but with meaner sharks, they'll be picked off like Alien"" - but the characterisation and shrewd social comment that added so much to Jaws just wasn't there. Bionic sharks munching research wallies doesn't I'm afraid in the end make a classic film, though it passed the time. It's a sort of rainy afternoon type film - as long as you don't expect any more from it than that, go ahead and watch.

There is one incredible moment early on in particular that is a complete and utter surprise - if you've seen this film, you'll know what I'm talking about.

At least they put that in the movie! If LL Cool J couldn't die, at least this character did!There was much better roles for her to play - she didn't have to break new ground. It's silly. I don't understand logic like that. Even Samuel Jackson bit the big one (or shall we say, the big one bit him)! These sharks look weak compared to JAWS. I bet that JAWS would kick Deep Blue's fins up and down the ocean! This movie had as much logic as The Island of Dr. Marleau had suspense!It's a shame I had to view this motion picture.

Although a lot of money probably went in to the CGI sharks, there was something about them that just screamed FAKE SHARKS to me, thus removing any tinge of fear that should otherwise have gripped my attention.The casting was good, featuring a variety of actors who have done well in other films, so the 6/10 rating by me is not a result of their individual efforts. Every single ""disaster with a tight deadline"" movie I have every seen has the same type of dialogue in general, only varied by technical language that fits each movie's specific disaster topic. There is always the anti-hero with a jaded past, a well-meaning expert who is compelled to risk all regardless, a handful of technical characters who are there to ""fill in"" the running time with jargon very specific to the premise of the disaster, and, as always, a character whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief. Usually, there is a rather trashy sexpot female to fulfill the requisite sex scene, as well. And, not to be dismissed, the body count must start rather early and not let up until a few minutes before the end of the story.The sets were austerely appropriate and believable. The costumes fit the story line. Even the touch of sex which seems standard for any disaster story (why is that, anyway?) with some near-nudity involving the female lead can be overlooked. Perhaps, if I had seen this for the first time close up in a movie theatre or at home on a big-screen TV, this production might have generated a little fear...but, on a little 19-inch flat screen, there just was nothing much to excite.Even given this rather lackluster review, the end product was almost fun with an unintentional ""campy"" tone to it, despite the generally serious topic of the species of humans and their place in the global food chain. I actually feel no regret that I shelled out $5, but feel a little disappointed it somehow feels like a movie based on a comic book. Watch this, without pre-thinking or expecting a lot, and it can be a fun way to while away a couple of hours.",Deep Blue Sea

Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane are excellent, as are Jaqueline McKenzie and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie has surprising twists: the shark sending the doc at the glass and the water breaking, the death of Susan and the visual effects are nearly perfect. The movie never gets dull and the film looks and feels like a lot of effort was put into it. Renny Harlin directs effortlessly and the score for the film is terrifying. The sharks could use work, but the film is unusually genuine. With surprises around every corner, a creepy atmosphere, brilliant actors and a invigorating story, Deep Blue Sea is one hell of a fun movie that is even better than Jaws!",Deep Blue Sea
275,DocHobbs,"Can't even measure up to ""guilty pleasure"" status",4,19 August 1999,"Leading up to the release of this underwater shark thriller, a friend of mine had been jokingly referring to it as ""Jaws 2000"".  And, although, it really doesn't have much in common with those pictures...it may have well been included as one, it's just as ridiculous and lame as the last two ""Jaws"" sequels.An ecclectic cast has CHUM written all over them as scientists/engineers/blah blah aboard an underwater research facility that is quickly flooding; stalked by genetically enhanced 'smart sharks'.  I was really rooting for Renny Harlin's film to be a guilty pleasure...but I'm afraid it can't even measure up to that status.  And we know for a fact that Harlin can take an action sequence as ridiculous as they come and make them work cinematically--look at the underrated ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" or ""Die Hard 2"".  But, ""Deep Blue Sea"" asks too much from me.  It's so unimaginatively preposterous; and characters barely register a pulse, much less develop (with the exception of LL Cool J- at least he puts a smile on your face).  I'll admit that when the sharks attack in this film; it's visceral, grisly and exciting on the most purile level.  But, that's not enough to save this misguided, just plain silly monstrosity.  Also, ask yourselves how much money you think the great Samuel L. Jackson had to be payed to utter the line : ""all right people, these sharks are thinking...HARD AND FAST!!""",Deep Blue Sea

Some of the movies I felt like I was watching were Jaws (of course), Jurassic Park, Alien, and Extreme Measures. There were others lurking in the back of my mind but I can't put a name to them.  I didn't find it very compelling, I didn't care for the characters much, and the effects were not very convincing.

I heaven't seen a good action movie in a long time and this one takes 1st place. I depends mostly on the action, but that action is INCREADIBLE! It doesent follow the usual pattern as do other horror movies such as ""I Still Know What You Did Last summer!"". When I wathced the movie, I thought to myself that it'll follow the usual pattern of deaths, but after the first one I don't know what to expect! It was great! I was smiling throughout the movie with exitement to see who'll die next! The sharks were really scary too! They moved like torpedos and attacked in one swift movement, shredding their victim/lunch in the most horrible fashion, which I enjoyed imensely! I was pleased that they didn't use the cliched White shark in this movie. They've gotten a bad reputation all ready from Jaws. Instead they picked the really ugly teethed Mako shark! That was a good move to veer away from cliches. It was a great movie for reviving that fear of the sea! I also enjoyed the fact that my buddy was a set decorator in the movie as well! Lucky guy.",Deep Blue Sea
278,mccormick632,Enjoyably Cheesy,7,21 May 2011,"Deep Blue Sea is a hard movie to review. On one hand, it's fun, its intense, and some of the acting is good. However, on the other hand, its special effects are laughable, especially the CGI, some of the characters are really unlikeable, and the rest of the acting ranges from just okay to bad.About the plot, there is actually a pretty good setup. A group of scientists are working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease by harvesting the tissue of three genetically enhanced Mako sharks. Things quickly spin out of control and the group of scientists have to get out of their underwater prison without getting eaten. Without giving too much away the plot is actually decent for a shark movie. The character's cause is just, though I would wonder why they needed three genetically enhanced sharks when one would have done just fine. Steven Spielberg's classic film Jaws proved that only having one shark is good enough, so why they had three I do not know.Anyway, the story then turns into your traditional monster on the loose flick with everyone trying to get to safety while avoiding the sharks. Some succeed, most...don't. The moments when a character dies are absolutely hilarious because it is when the CGI kicks in and both the sharks and the people just look awful. You feel bad for the characters but it doesn't make the moment less funny than it is.As far as the acting goes, again it ranges. Some of the actors, like Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, and Thomas Jane do the best acting in the film. Saffron Burrows and all the other characters are just okay, either they didn't have enough screen time or just paled in comparison to the three actors mentioned above.All in all Deep Blue Sea is an enjoyable movie. The occasional stupid moment don't detract from the intensity, humor, unintentional humor, and scariness the film has. For what its worth, it's not bad, but if you are really in a mood for a shark film, go watch Jaws. But if you already saw Jaws, give this a try. Just be prepared for some unintentional hilarious moments and awful CGI.",Deep Blue Sea
279,Thatguywiththeface,*,1,25 July 2012,"Horrible. It's not even so bad that it becomes funny, it's just bad. It takes itself epicly through the whole movie when in all reality, you really don't care, you just want to see sharks attack. But then, these sharks that they show you take up like half the ocean are suddenly able to maneuver through the corridors of the underwater lab.Then, these sharks, that have become SO SMART that they have engineered the entire escapade to escape, after being 2 seconds from freedom, are lured away by a little blood to their ultimate demise. I could understand if the movie was trying to be funny, but it didn't allow itself to be funny and just became non sensical. The only fun part was after Sam Jackson's big speech. And LL Cool J as the comic relief, he was just trying WAY too hard to be funny, which again, just made it boring instead of funny. I really wanted to enjoy the obscenity of the movie, but in the end it was all too forced to make it funny in any way, instead just making it more and more ridiculous and boring.",Deep Blue Sea

Save your money, that's my advice.",Deep Blue Sea
284,Gigante,Ha.....you thought it was safe to go back into the water!,10,14 November 1999,"Wow! That's all I had to say when I left the cinema. I saw it on the opening day in the first showing and I was one of the luckiest people in the UK......to see this great movie before most others.To start with...Jaws it is not and never will be. Jaws was a classic because you didn't see the shark and it was more suspenseful. That was the scary part. The scary part about this was you actually saw the sharks! And a lot too. The Gen. 2 shark was absolutely amazing......a credit to its builders.Now the plot has come under criticism. The actors have come under criticism. Well what do expect with a movie thats main stars are the sharks? The plot wasn't that bad. If you criticise then you have to criticise Jurassic Park too for being so ridiculous. The actors can come under stick (except LL Cool J who steals the show). Saffron Burrows, while good to rest the eyes after a bloody death scene, isn't as bad as everyone makes out. Its just her British accent that spoils it. Thomas Jane was alright and definitely one to watch for in the future. Some have likened him to a poor man's Harrison Ford. Well if this does to Jane, what Star Wars did to Ford then we are looking at a good star. Samuel L Jackson does his part well. And the rest are just shark fodder so no one really cares what they act like.After a good opening scene (a real twist to the tale) it goes downhill for a bit but kick starts into life as soon as the storm hits (yet again similar to JP so if you criticise this then you criticise that too).Now I've read some of the other comments by people. Don't believe what you hear from others. I mean the facility is called Aquatica, not Argonautica as someone mentioned. They criticise the fact that the sharks can smash through steel doors yet not get through the wire fence surrounding the facility. If you were actually watching the film you'd know why.POSSIBLE SPOILER:Because the sharks want the humans to flood the facility so that the fence is below sea level and escape. Otherwise if they tried to get out then the fence would act as a net and hook them up. Thats why they don't just break through at the start.OK YOU CAN READ AGAIN......Stand by for shocks galore as the sharks pop up and out here there and everywhere. They attack with such ferocity and speed that you will never go into the sea for a while after this.This is the first and only movie I have seen twice at the cinema. And I've seen a lot of good films. I just can't wait for it to arrive on video.If there was one disappointment to the film (and I may be being a little critical and morbid) then it is the body count. I was expecting one or two more. But the sharks can't eat too many people and get so full they can't kill the rest now can they. And of course we have the obligatory bra and panties scene which is classic viewing in itself!Go and see this before its too late. Ignore the critics. Follow carefully and you'll get the big picture. I only hope that there were actually 4 sharks and not 3 and that the fourth escaped and bred..........................it could happen....it is Hollywood. I mean they resurrected Siguorney Weaver in Alien: Resurrection. They created another dinosaur complex in the Lost World. Why not have another one? This time the sharks do get out into the sea! If wishes could come true.",Deep Blue Sea
285,tyhemp-2,It's definitely not Jaws...,10,11 December 1999,"Nobody can say that this movie didn't scare them.  This movie gives more than enough blood and gore and scares, and who cares about the boring cast? Deep Blue Sea gives the audience enough to look at with LL Cool J, Samuel Jackson, and Thomas Jane...what more does there need to be?The story takes place on a deserted shark facility in Mexico, and the sharks are obviously computer animated.  Nonetheless, it is absolutely frightening when you realize that since the facility has flooded--this was obvious from previews and promotions--(also, the scene where the flooding begins is so action packed I forgot to breath) those extremely fast sharks are going to be lurking around...somewhere...and I guarantee you will not know where.Overall, this film is not a Jaws wannabe.  It's more original than that.  It has its own story and plot, and there is obviously more excitement since there is a trio of sharks rather than one like in Jaws.  What this movie set out to do, it did.  It scared the living day lights out of me...every shock scene made me jump.  I couldn't predict any of the startle shots before they happened.  However, you won't leave this movie feeling like you just watched anything as great as Jaws or anything as original as Scream.  Most people would probably feel that its cliche, but I know for a fact they'll leave it a little edgier than they had been before they watched it.Furthermore, do not watch this movie in the dark.  I learned this personally when I first watched it on video.  Watch it during the day with a few other people and you'll be alright.  I also want to note that this movie breaks the conventional ""female heroine"" standards with its turn of events in the end.  I did NOT know that THAT was coming.. But you'll just have to see this one for yourself.I give Deep Blue Sea a 9/10.  I'm a big fan of Samuel Jackson movies.  His appearance, and ""disappearance,"" totally light up this film.

And it took 3 writers to make this??? <spoiler> Overall, I gave it a 2 just because it made me laugh so hard when Samuel L Jackson got eaten mid-speech.  God that was hilarious!

289,33Ford,Finally an action movie this year that delivers....,9,1 August 1999,"Deep Blue Sea begins with some fairly suspenseful scenes at the very beginning. But then as it uses the first third of the film to introduce you to the characters and set the stage for what is taking place it is a little slow.However, once all that necessary stuff is out of the way the movie takes off like a rocket and you are on the edge of your seat up to the very end. If you have read the other comments here I don't need to go over the story again. The sharks are quite terrifying and I think the fact that they have incredible speed and can strike so quickly is what makes them even scarier. The other aspect of the film that I found quite creative and unlike anything I can recall seeing before, are the scenes where the underwater lab has been ruptured by attacking sharks and this giant wall of water rushes in sweeping everything before it. I am not sure how they filmed some of these scenes of people being overwhelmed by rushing water that tosses them cartwheeling down corriders and stairwells. It sure looked real and if it was, how they kept from killing somebody is beyond me. There are a few scenes that stretch credibility....like the guy who jumps in a pen with a shark and proceeds to grab its fin and ride it and then treats this like it is an everyday act. Yeah, right.  And some of the scenes are pretty gory and graphic. But those are minor quibbles. The real story is that the movie is very entertaining. LL Cool J is the chef on board the sea lab and he has the best lines in the movie....most of them very funny. The audience I saw it with loved him.

Sure, the scripted dialog is creaky and the characters are wooden.  Like I said, it's a formula picture. The question with movies like this is not whether it's original.  The question is simply this:  does it scare the bejesus out of the audience, or not?  Further, does it incite gleeful riot in the theatre by dangling its players before the fearsome beasts like live bait?  Does it surprise us at all? Do we jump out of our seats, really jump, at least once?To these questions, be assured that every answer is ""yes"".A movie like this is all about sensation, just like a rollercoaster, and it must be rated on pure visceral power. Unlike the current release, ""The Haunting,"" which put me to sleep, ""Deep Blue Sea"" had me in its teeth from the first scene. And I do not feel guilty.  And niether will director Rennie Harlin when the box office flood of cash comes rolling in.It must also have, if not plausible pathos, some comic relief. And at least one or two winning performances that make us care enough to set us up for the kill.  ""Deep Blue Sea"" has, as it's two most memorable characters, Samuel L. Jackson and L.L. Cool J., who light this happy retread with humanity.  Jackson and Harlin must still be cackling after perpetrating the best screen joke of the Ninties, bar none.  You'll know it when you see it, folks, and it's worth the price of admission.So, movie fans, take that nerdy friend of yours, the one who swears that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is ""Scary as Hell,"" to this gothic house of horror on the high seas.

Even with little expectation, and seeing it for free, it didn't live up to my expectation and it wasn't worth the money. What a terrible waste of a decent plot line. Everyone in the movie was unbelievably careless,(even when warned), and the sharks are lightning fast and extremely vicious one minute, and slow and clumsy the next.  How about a little continuity.  The sharks can attack people standing next to the water and kill them in  seconds yet it will grab others by the leg and drag them around for a few minutes causing little damage.I've heard people complain that it was unfairly compared to the 'Jaws' movies. Well guess what, one of the 3 sharks is killed exactly the same way the shark is killed in 'Jaws 2'.The acting is bad, the casting is bad and the writing is bad.

The second you see them, the second the audience can't wait for them to be brutally ripped apart. And sure enough, after a couple of creepy underwater P.O.V. shots, and a ""did you hear something?"" from one of the teens, the menacing sharks rip apart the boat. But as soon as they're about to be viciously eaten, a tough Willis-like scientist hero saves them by mere inches by capturing the sharks.Meanwhile, back in the city, a scientist who we learn is the head honcho of the sea labs working on the creatures, has to explain herself to the leaders of the company why her test shark got out of the facility. Apparently, the test sharks are being genetically enhanced to create an antidote to Alzheimer's disease (yeah, I don't get it, either).Back at her sea lab, where she brings along another expert from the company, we learn about the lab, which is conveniently located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and meet the Thomas Jane character from earlier who has the tough emotionless I-don't-answer-to-no-one attitude. Eventually, while extracting brain tissue from a shark later in the film, an accident occurs with one of the scientists and that, mixed along with a devastating rain storm and vicious creatures, sets the lab into a state of complete wreckage, and the characters have to fight their way to the surface.First of all, if the film was trying to be subliminal about it's being inspired by Jaws, it didn't do a good job. One of the sharks is wrangled into the lab with, being conventionally pointed out by a character, a license plate stuck in its mouth. When they pull it out, it is not only a license plate, but the exact same one pulled out of the stomach of a tiger shark in Jaws. Ooohsubtle! Not only that, but every shark that is killed in the film is done as an homage to the first three Jaws films, which I won't spoil for the sake of the people who haven't seen the films.While campy to the rim and packed full of clichés and tackiness, it seems to have a soft sense of knowing it.

After I had read some bad reviews of Deep Blue Sea, I was a little suspicious. But because I didn't know what to do, I decided nevertheless to watch it. On the whole I found DBS was worth the money but there are 2 things which are very bad. First, the underwater-animation of the sharks. It looks like a real-time animation of a bad computergame and is much worse than for example in Episode One. Second, the background of the scientific work was probably the most illogical thing I've ever seen. The scientists want to make neurological experiments to find a treatment for Alzheimer's. A serious scientist would take monkeys, which have, as the sole mammals, a great-brain-part or it would be at least reasonable to take other mammals. But the scientists in DBS take great and dangerous sharks which brains have practically no similarity to human brains. Wouldn't it be more logical if the army bred the sharks to use as organic weapons?

Remakes of different movies have always been made with different plot lines and also have been successful at many times. One should not be too impatient to call Deep Blue sea an imitation.Matter of fact the main story line of of Deep Blue Sea is quite interesting (check out the trailer). the film lost its ground on other elements. Though I didn't go to the cinema to be impressed as a Oscar judge for acting, I still felt the lack of depth in the performance of the actors as to give a bit more realistic approach of the disastrous situations their characters were in to be.The film does have a lot of suspense and thrill. The sharks seem almost too invincible at times but yet at the end the heroes always succeed. The F/X seem good as it difficult to distinguish the computer generated effects but at some scenes they really look stupid like when a standing 6 ft man is just swallowed which meant that the shark had jaws a 6 ft wide jaw(thats big as a T-rex jaw).I think the movie could have had more suspense, thrill, realism and excitement from a relatively interesting storyline.

Even a dumb effects movie should have some respect for its audience. The dialogue is consistently pathetic, and every single character is one-dimensional and unlikeable. LL Cool J's character, in particular, is a disgraceful pander to the audience - a stereotype black guy who uses the word 'ass' in every other sentence and acts like some kind of evangelical lecher most of the time(crucifixes kill sharks, apparently - because sharks are the devil, you see. Because they eat other creatures. Unlike man, who of course doesn't). He explains physics through sexy woman analogies. Oh good, something our thick, penile brains can understand. Naturally, it's up to him to provide all the cheap laughs and atrocious oneliners (and even those are underdeveloped).One woman commits the double crime of being both a scientist AND British.

Every single time something was to happen in the movie, you knew it was going to happen, because the characters were ever so stupid to just stand there waiting for something bad to happen. So you see a few scenes with dummies (now I mean the dolls) torn in half by sharks and tons of water everywhere.This movie lacks the suspense and growing uneasiness Jaws offered, and, of course, one compares it to Jaws since it is a shark movie. Now I liked Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, and Long Kiss Goodnight a lot, but Deep Blue Sea, nah, wasn't worth the time it took to see it. Renny Harlin can do better, at least he did before.",Deep Blue Sea

The film was actually quite good (IMHO).The special effects were quite well done, the computer generated sharks were decent and the action was reasonably constant with very few ""lulls"".

Anyhow, Renny Harlin's main objective seems to be to redeem himself for his good-but-misunderstood box office bomb The Long Kiss Goodnight.  The first 20 minutes or so are pretty slow and tedious, but as soon as the sharks lose their tempers, Deep Blue Sea is top flight entertainment.  With more action than your average monster flick, guessing who dies next is not the most enjoyable aspect.  Renny Harlin's slow-motion sequences are still the best.  If anyone besides Harlin deserves praise for this film, it's indy actor Thomas Jane, as the likeable shark-wrangler.

It wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, not by a long shot. However, after a long summer of one disappointment after another for me at the box office, I had a good time watching it.

Similar movies to this are The Thing (John Carpenter), The Alien Trilogy,Pitch Black, and Screamers. I don't know why I like movies like this, but I do, and I liked Deep Blue Sea, despite obvious CG sharks.Saffron Burrows is beautiful, LL Cool J is surprisingly funny, and Micheal Rappaport is his usual greatness.Bottom Line: You will like this movie.

I loved sharks, and I loved movies, so sharks in a movie was just the bomb-diggity. For some reason, this mediocre movie has stuck in my head over these past years, coming up in my mind rather often. It's not even that I necessarily payed attention to the story all that much, I mean, I know that there are sharks with mombo sized brains, and they're out to kill the scientists that made them that way, and the one b*tchy scientist lady won't let the guys kill the sharks. I just thought that that was awesome. Deep Blue Sea really is just mindless shark action and a chick in her underwear, with a splash of a great story line. There really is so much potential for such an interesting story, but it was downgraded by the massive amount of unnecessary violence. I, personally, have a great fondness for this film, though I have not seen it since I was 6, so don't hate me if it sucks a lot more than I am leading you to believe. It really is a movie that you should take the time to watch at some point in your life.",Deep Blue Sea
309,KingFilmsCo,"Forgettable, if decent, action thriller that almost made waves",5,18 January 2015,"A 5/10 review isn't necessarily damning in the case of Deep Blue Sea. It is an average, mildly enjoyable movie with some impressive elements to it. However, with so many shark movies out there, there needs to be something that sets a flick apart from the rest. For as many good points that Deep Blue Sea achieves, its mediocrities end up sinking a lot of good will. First, the good: Director Renny Harlin knew enough that audiences going into a shark movie wanted several things: 1) good-looking sharks 2) creative shark attacks 3) good-looking actorsIn descending importance. Luckily, the first point was hit spot on with some very good-looking animatronic sharks (when they are used). These giant metal monsters looked very nice (especially when one is used to an ocean of Italian rubber-shark ripoffs) and you as a viewer could easily get lost in the world of the movie - in the sense that yes, these must be real sharks.The second point was helped out by the film's setting, the abandoned sea lab Aquatica. It has a great cold industrial look to it. By flooding and destroying the area thanks to plot contrivances, Harlin had sharks in creative locales: swimming around in corridors, hiding in bedrooms, and attacking in elevator shafts. These are new and fun ways to spice up the fact that as a movie-going threat, sharks often do little else other than pop up to chomp on someone in a jump-scare ""Gotcha!"" moment. The setting does help though, like a shark forcing the station's cook into an oven and inadvertently turning it on with the cook inside, or an entertaining helicopter kill (clever sharks!).Finally, the cast put in a somewhat serviceable (for this genre) movie. Samuel Jackson stole the show, acting as we are accustomed to see him act; though the moments where he was not yelling are compelling as well. Saffron Burrows did well as the ""attractive woman with a British accent"" (always a plus), and Thomas Jane sort of did the ""tough action guy who don't play by the rules"" thing. The rest of the crew (with a notable exception) was just sort of there, but at least we had attractive and likable leads.Despite the money and care that went into the film though, its negative points started to sink its more laudable aspects:1) CGI sharks with bad CGI people 2) Good characters killed off; bad characters surviving 3) Stupid plot decisions that bring down the movieIn the special features of the DVD, Harlin went on at length about how needed something more than mechanical sharks to do all the scenes he had in mind. He turned to digital sharks here, and boasted that the audience would never be able to tell the difference.Well, this is hazarding a guess, but if you notice a character suddenly replaced with a stiff, lifeless, textureless, plastic-looking computerized Barbie doll, bank your money on the shark being CG as well. Also, if you notice that the sharks are suddenly 100x more agile they were in other scenes, those probably are also not ""really"" there. I can understand the desire to ""one-up"" other shark movies (because of the sort of limited nature of filming practical-effects sharks I mentioned above). However, the solution Harlin opted for doesn't exactly thrill. Awful looking digital chunks of your favorite nondescript actors filled the screen with strangely-smooth and plastic-looking sharks. It's groan-inducing each time I saw it happen. Contrasting that to the underwater scenes filmed with the animatronic models, and we realize that nothing can substitute for a cleverly-staged model. Most people already know one of the ""big twists"" in Deep Blue Sea, but suffice to say, the more likable characters do not all survive. In their place we have LL Cool J,. Some reviews pegged him as the ""audience favorite,"" and I don't know why. He didn't act very well, his script is pretty lousy outside of one throwaway joke about an omelet, and the movie spent far too much time on him. While exciting things were happening elsewhere, we had to listen to the comedy stylings of LL Cool J and his foul-mouthed parrot. As for the plot, I didn't talk about it much because I don't really care about plots in a movie with sharks. All these movies need is a premise that is not so outside of reality that it works. And ""big brain sharks hunt humans"" was inoffensive enough to work. However, certain decisions made by the characters added up. For example, characters watching a window crack for nearly 40 seconds before they decide that being in front of a breaking-glass-window under the sea is a bad idea. One character pointlessly ""baiting"" the shark in a way that is needlessly life-endangering. Situations seemed to be set up in order to kill off characters (usually when we haven't seen a shark attack in a while). Such situational character stupidity was a lame way of killing people off, especially when the ""treat"" we got was bad CGI. Even Italian shark knockoffs have the decency to give us gore effects.After all of this negativity, was Deep Blue Sea a bad film? Not necessarily. The action scenes with the sharks had some creativity and were handled competently by Harlin. There were explosions and gushes of water (and shark deaths) to keep the audience's attention. The movie provided some of the bare-bones minimums a shark movie needs, and by having multiple mechanical sharks, it went a few steps beyond most shark movies.However, it was definitely a film I have no desire to see again. The final gut reaction I felt was ""well, it was OK."" The movie certainly did not offend me, and I enjoyed several scenes and situations within.But was that really the reaction I should have to a movie about super killer sharks?",Deep Blue Sea
310,judithturner-50577,Solid shark movie- better than The Meg.,6,3 January 2019,"I love shark movies. Nobody is going to mistake Deep Blue Sea for Jaws but this is a good film- certainly great for its genre. At first glance, Deep Blue Sea might look like just another dumb, pointless monster movie crawling from the depths to take a run at the mid-summer box office chart. However, while I won't argue that this creature feature is going to enrich the mind, the script is characterized by a certain flair and Renny Harlin's direction keeps things moving at a breakneck pace. Consequently, while Deep Blue Sea may not be the most edifying motion picture to arrive in mutiplexes this year, it proves capable of doing something that many more artistically ambitious films fail at: entertaining an audience for nearly two hours.",Deep Blue Sea

The story itself is just nonsense that is justified by some wanna-be science. If there is an award for creative nonsense, then the idea of Alzheimer  in connection with the sharks, would definitely be the winner. Despite of that the CGI effects were really poor, because the proportions of the sharks changed during the whole film, not talking about the totally unbelievable movements of those creatures.

Particularly in the dramatic scenes, actors like Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job. In addition, it was not like all aspects of this movie were fake. Sure the idea of increasing the shark's brain mass to make it smarter was a tad out there, but the way the sharks act, their attack patterns, and their coordination were all incredibly accurate. When I first saw this film 5 years ago, I was just stunned by the quality, suspense, and impact of scenes.

321,maurovicmarin,"Not even close to S.S. 's ""Jaws""",4,13 October 2016,"Deep Blue Sea (1999) is a movie directed by Renny Harlin starring Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport. It's a shark based thriller with a twist that also makes it somewhat a sci-fi movie. It's impossible to compare with the shark parodies made recently, but it's also not like the previously released shark classics such as Jaws"".The whole action happens on a floating facility used as a test lab to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The medicine is being created from the brain of sharks, which are kept in special cages to prevent them from breaking out. Which of course happens, it wouldn't be a thriller if everything went fine throughout the movie. Chaos breaks out in the facility when a shark attacks an employer and they manage to escape. It turns out the sharks where genetically mutated to be 5 time smarter than any other animal. The crew, all by themselves, must survive the shark attacks, and think of a strategy end this.Starting from the main actors"" in the movie, the sharks' visual effects are awful, in my opinion, the robotic shark from Jaws"" looks much better. They are poorly made and all of the action regarding them looks entirely fake, with blurry and stiff movements. Which ruins almost the entire movie (as far as visuals go) because they are the key element.The real good actor worth mentioning here is LL Cool J (Preacher) who is the cook of the facility. He still manages to make a side character one of the most interesting and comic ones. He is the only reason why this movie is watchable. Other scenes are either boring with no energy, predictable or look totally fakeIf you wanna watch a shark classic i would much rather recommend Jaws"" by Steven Spielberg.

That's what did it this time: I read an interview with Saffron Burrows and she expressed that there is some confusion in the ethics and reaction to her character. Everyone seems to hate her character, and she didn't think the character was that bad.  I must say I agree with her.But first: The film en whole is a very basic bit of `ooo where is the thing that's about to EAT me' fun. Human error drops human to the bottom of the food chain. It does better than average at suspenseful scaryness because not only are you continually surprised at how clever these sharks have become, but also the crew is in a large mostly-underwater facility with them. They're being attacked in their very living quarters! Watching this film in my bedroom, even in the middle of a desert (Texas), this point was still disconcerting.The ethical debating fodder orbits around the fact of how much dislike the other characters, apparently as well as much of the audience, throw upon the character of Dr. McAlester. The main problem I had with this is the fact that the main common-sense-error her character made, she appears to have made in conjunction with another character. But nobody throws any blame or dislike upon him for it at all. Very strange. There is also the fact that the error was made in good intention ...they were, quite frankly, *blinded* by their good intensions. But the root of people's reaction seems to be bedded in cold fear of ALL general genetic research.  So sitting within this shark-attack basic action flick, here we stumble upon good subjects to get caught in late night debates about. But of course, that's not for everyone.

329,liamzdaman2,Deep Blue Sea review,5,7 August 2008,"There has only ever been one really good shark movie in the history of film and deep blue sea is not it. For those of you that don't know what film I'm talking about SHAME ON YOU!!!! This film is undoubtedly entertaining, however falls short on many aspects.The story is quite poor but it does enough to keep the viewer awake during the film. the fact that the sharks are ""super smart"" adds to the drama for one thing.However thin story lines of a Doctor trying to ""save the world"" and using sharks as the Guinea pigs just doesn't do it for me but i suppose this kind of plot line is to be expected in action/thriller movies so that does not take the film's mark down to much.The ACTION!! is good and there are times in this film that the tension level is ALMOST as high as SOME parts of JAWS but frankly does not reach the same level at any point. The director has obviously went for action ahead of storyline(most likely because he thinks thats what people what to see, and he is probably correct). However there is no mystery in the film you see all the sharks all the time and there is no attempt to conceal them from the audience. I know I am comparing this film to Jaws a lot but come on, who isn't ?!?. The casualty count is also WAY to high with all but two of the main characters surviving and frankly some of the deaths are just plain over the top. Pradickable is a word that springs to mind also while watching this film.The ACTING is what i would describe as ""very bad"" even Sam Jackson's performance falls short here, mind you the cheesy duologue and bizarre romantic under tones do nothing to help what is a very good actor. The best actor in this film by some way is LL COOL J he is dare I say....good in this film, adding his own style to the part and at times being quite humorous.The CGI is okay in this film but at times is very obvious. I would not say it is bad but not a ""CGI masterpiece"" as another reviewer called it. Don't get me wrong it is much better than Jaws but it is HOW it's used that lets it down e.g going as far as to actually show a huge shark eat and swallow an entire human body!!!ALL in all id say this film is okay if you do not take it seriously, but is still quite bad. 5 out of 10",Deep Blue Sea

Unfortunately this amusement won't be directed at the very unfunny LL Cool J, but rather at the sheer lack of talent, credibility and suspense generated by a cast marginally weaker than the overall concept itself.

332,total_sweetheart,really good shark movie,7,24 January 2005,"i'm no professional, but i thought deep blue sea was an excellent shark movie. the sharks were scary, surprising and fast. i thought the casting was excellent (""carter"" was a cutie and the cook was funny) and i really liked the ending...no matter what anybody says. i thought the plot was good and simple enough that you didn't have to do any deep thinking really. and there really wasn't enough time during attacks for my stomach to untense. the girl scientist's accent got annoying at times, but she was a believable character. i wasn't crazy about samuel l jackson's character, but he made it work...and did i add that the shark attacks were scary and GOOD!! i'll admit it...i JUMPED!!",Deep Blue Sea

While LL Cool J was actually pretty funny in this, unfortunately out of the cast at hand if Samuel L Jackson couldn't save this, no one could have.

Turns out that this was a decent movie, and not much of a Jaws rip off at all. I was jumping out of my seat throughout the whole movie, even when it was obvious what was coming up.  Yes, the film does contain your classic horror 'don't go in there' situations, but handles those moments without boring the audience.  The dialogue is pretty poor, but the special effects were very well done. Thrown into the mix was a nice performance from LL Cool J as a religious cook that loves his pet parrot, and a great ending to a monologue by Samuel L.

There are those who like to sit in their cinema seat with a bucket of popcorn, turn their brain off and enjoy the spectacle.  I subscribe to the latter category and, although cinema-goers no doubt display far more variation than the above would suggest, 'Deep Blue Sea' is a film not designed for analysis but for sheer, unadulterated enjoyment.True, we've seen it all before.  'Deep Blue Sea' would win no awards for originality - but therein lies the pleasure of the film.  As it races along why not play 'spot the stiff'?   see if you can guess who will make it through to the final reel.  Borrowed material it may be, but 'Deep Blue Sea' is far from being secondhand and its conclusion is far from being predictable.There is always a place in the cinema for well made and undemanding action/thrillers.  'Deep Blue Sea' is a fine example of the genre.  It may suffer at times from a lack of clarity with regards to whether it is a monster flick or a disaster movie but, with its tongue stuck firmly in its cheek, 'Deep Blue Sea' is a delight from beginning to end.  Renny Harlin has a clear agenda to entertain and succeeds admirably.Be warned - this is not a film for those with a chronic sense of humour deficiency.

Unfortunately the Makos (now somewhat larger and more intelligent) have other ideas and wreak havoc on all involved.I enjoyed this film for the action and suspense. I'm not concerned with the 'Jaws' comparisons (in fact I welcome any movies that attempt to emulate THE ultimate shark movie).The suspenseful moments, sudden suprises and body bits kept my attention and I was quite happy with the compu-shark images.If only we could find some duct tape to shut Saffron Burrows up. Her monotonous speeches took some of the shine from the film. The highlight of her appearance was the the wet T-shirt scene.Reality Check: All sharks must keep moving in water to keep the water passing over their gills to provide oxygen. A stationary shark is a dead shark.Final thought: Makos are quite agile. You should see them leap out of the water when hooked on a line.

341,metta-4,`Jaws' meets `Deep rising',9,23 July 2002,"At first sight one may think this is a far from original movie since we have seen dangerous sharks and other wild creatures in too many thrillers before. Some famous, but not always great films in this genre are `Jaws', `Tremors', the `Alien' trilogy and of course `Deep rising'. Although this one does not divers much from the above mentioned movies, it certainly does combine elements from those titles in a superb way.                  The sharks look more vicious than `Jaws', and they are way more intelligent. (Here we see the element of genetically experiments from `Jurassic park'.) Quite unusual for a movie of this genre is the character development we are treated on. It also shows us that the line between good and evil can be extremely thin. All this gives the movie an extra dimension. Despite the serious touch `Deep blue sea' remains a fun movie witch does not take itself too serious. Just watch the cook fight the shark and you'll understand! It's the loose approach you know from `Tremors' and `Deep rising'. Isn't there anything wrong left to mention? Yes, there is since Samuel L. Jackson does not get enough screenplay. His departure from the movie is abrupt, but funny to.

344,Jerald,Could've been better...,3,26 December 2000,"WARNING: The following may contain spoilers!Being an insane JAWS fan, I was very excited to see another shark movie hit the theaters. I knew, of course, that nothing was going to affect me in the same manner that JAWS did (I saw JAWS when I was 4 years old).The way that they hyped this movie was almost as if it was a sequel to the legendary shark film. Bigger, Smarter, Faster, Meaner? Than what? I think we all know what that refers to. And how about that license plate scene, an obvious tribute to JAWS, but where did he (the shark) get that license plate? Don't get me wrong, I love it when a director pays homage to a classic (or his/her favorite movie for that matter), I just think they hyped this movie to be like JAWS too much! I would have never compared them on my own, except for the fact that I kept getting JAWS references thrown at me throughout the film.This movie would have done better without that hype. It had some fun moments, unfortunately, at the expense of believability. This movie just did not have the ability to suspend my disbelief. Samuel L. Jackson's demise, as an example, is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in a movie, yet I think that scene was supposed to be terrifying. (Watch that scene in slow motion and you'll see Samuel Jackson turn into a cartoon version of the ""toy diver"" you had when you were a kid.)As far as the acting is concerned, it's about par for the course. One really shouldn't expect an action movie to have superb acting, unless there are superb actors in it. While Samuel L. Jackson was in this movie, his part was pretty weak, and a shark eats him pretty early on. (They must have been running over budget). Enough said.  LL Cool J however, had a part in this movie that was fun and enjoyable, and he had some cute lines.Now we come to my pet peeve in the movie industry... CGI effects that don't stay consistent with the background! The big problem with CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) is the difficulty in keeping a moving CGI image consistent with it's background (or medium as the case may be here). Jurassic Park was an excellent example of this being done well. (Aircraft flight paths must be very difficult to model because I've never seen a CGI airplane fly correctly.) As such, watching these sharks swim did not make me think they were underwater. the water seemed too thin. The problem may be that I've seen real sharks swim, and real airplanes fly, but I've never seen a real dinosaur run. To be honest, there's nothing like having something really there. I'd rather see a bad model (JAWS), than a bad CGI effect (Anaconda). If your movie is well rounded however, the impact of some bad effects on the whole movie is not as big. The shark in JAWS could've been made of papier-mache and the film would still have been a hit!As far as that JAWS comparison goes, here it is.JAWS: Golden Actors, Papier-Mache Shark, excellent movie.DEEP BLUE SEA: Papier-Mache Actors, Nonexistent Sharks, not a very good movie.My Rating 3 out of 10",Deep Blue Sea

Although how you can spoil anything already this rancid is quite beyond me.The basic premise: shark's brains contain a chemical which would seem to reverse the onset of Alzheimer' Disease. The bigger the brain, the more chemical produced. And so we get genetically engineered sharks. However, what the scientists didn't spot: the bigger the brain, the more intelligent the animal.....OOoooo....Samuel L. Jackson obviously realised how much of a turkey this was when, part-way through, he gets turned into shark hors d'oeuvres. I'm sure he was grateful to get away from this piece of muck, and if he's got any sense, he'll wipe it from his resumé. He must have been half-asleep when he agreed to do this. Or maybe he did it as a favour. Or a joke. Who knows? One thing's for sure: he made a biiiiig mistake taking this in the first place.The acting was wooden. The characters (with the possible exception of the cook/preacher) had no characterisation. The CGI - oh, please, don't get me started on the CGI. There were enough animal-fights-back clichés here to fill a good sized trailer. Originality was obviously just a word in the dictionary to these people, rather than a film-making concept.Within the first five minutes of the film, we were already guessing which ones would be left alive. I got two of the last three, and as we watched the film, we could predict which character was next for the nibble.

348,DonutMassacre64,My Favorite Shark Movie,8,26 May 2020,"Yes, even over Jaws. Jaws is a masterpiece, but Deep Blue Sea just ticks all the boxes of a movie I can always put on and never be bored. DBS is an entertaining action-thriller with a solid cast, great animatronics (albeit with badly aged CGI, but not enough to ruin everything), and a plot that is dumb but simple enough to follow. It also doesn't try to be another Jaws rip-off like so many other shark movies mistakenly do and it's not a dumb parody played for laughs like something like Sharknado. It's a B-Movie at heart played straight like an ""A-Movie"" and I just love it.An underwater research facility called Aquatica has been testing sharks to find a cure for Alzheimers. The head of the crew Susan (Saffron Burrows) has been illegally modifying their brain tissue to amplify the success rate of finding the right cure. Unfortunately for her and the rest of the graveyard shift, this means the sharks are now smarter and begin manipulating the humans to destroy the facility and releasing the sharks to the open sea. The unnatural intelligence these sharks now have will cause a drastic change in nature's food chain so now the humans must stop them and escape the crumbling facility. Other notable characters include shark wrangler Carter (Thomas Jane) who takes quite the beating throughout, smartass Scoggins (Michael Rapaport) who knows the facility in and out, comedic religious cook Preach (LL Cool J) who is a hoot everytime he's onscreen, and Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) who is sent by the head suits to monitor the crew's final test after a test shark had escaped at the beginning of the movie.The film has many memorable moments such as Preach beginning a tape recording in case he doesn't make it with the recipe for the perfect omelet, Susan randomly getting out of her wetsuit just to electrocute a shark, the entire sequence where the remaking crew are going up the steps as flames drop down and water rises up, and the most memorable moment where Franklin is suddenly eaten while giving a heroic speech to the arguing crew. What makes Franklin's death so memorable was that he's played by Samuel L. Jackson who is arguably the biggest star of this cast of famous faces. And for fans of Jaws there are Easter eggs sprinkled throughout.The film ends with Susan redeeming her character by sacrificing herself in order for Carter and Preach to finish off the final shark before it escapes to the open sea. This movie is no Jaws but it doesn't try to be and it's certainly more entertaining. Director Renny Harlin gives us another fun hit after films such as Die Hard 2 and Nightmare on Elm Street 4. He's the guy someone like Roland Emmerich wishes he could be.8/10 one of my favorite movies and overall my favorite shark movie.",Deep Blue Sea

Its a good shark movie, but completely different then the more sedate Jaws and some of the scenes are actually quite scary. When i first watched this i must have been 9 years old and i WAS scared. It has humour, shocks, action what more could you possibly ask for? Who cares about a complicated plot, this is a popcorn blockbuster which you will enjoy for 1 1/2 hours. The simple plot works (scientist finds cure for Alzeimers in sharks brains, unfortunately sharks brains are too small for the drug to be widely produced so the scientists create genetically modified sharks that are bigger so therefore have bigger brains.

350,communistgodzilla,Just when you thought it was safe to go into the video store.,7,27 July 2005,"If 'Jaws' and 'Alien' had a baby, that baby would probably look a lot like Deep Blue Sea', a big, loud, dumb action movie that doesn't try to pretend to be anything else. It's short on logic, the dialog is dumb, most of the actors don't seem to be trying very hard, and the science is dubious at best, but despite all that, 'Deep Blue Sea' manages to entertain.The plot of the movie is simple: a group of scientists at an undersea research facility are on the verge of discovering a cure for Alhzheimer's disease. How? By meddling about with the brains of live sharks (don't ask). Things are going swimmingly, until Mother Nature grows tired of having some of her creations tampered with. One typhoon and several gratuitous explosions later, the scientists find themselves cut off from the surface of the facility and at the mercy of a group of sharks that are smarter than the average fish. It seems that those meddling scientists made the sharks smart, and they're about to pay for their folly. With the base flooding and sharks roaming the corridors, the survivors find themselves in a race for survival.For the most part, 'Deep Blue Sea' works fairly well, and there are some good jolts and action sequences, but at the same there's nothing here that's particularly fresh. However, there is one death that is so unexpected and surprising, you might find yourself hitting the 'back' button on the DVD remote to make sure you weren't seeing things.'Deep Blue Sea' is not an actor's movie, but most of the cast acquits itself fairly well. Rapper LL Cool J does a good job with what could be a clichéd character (the religious man who struggles with his faith under dire circumstances), and injects the role with humanity and humor. He also has a very memorable encounter with a shark in a kitchen. Thomas Jane has the 'action hero' part, and he's solid, but unspectacular. Saffron Burrowes is okay as the lead scientist, and she's not above stripping down to her undies if the situation calls for it. But once again, no one will be watching 'Deep Blue Sea' for the acting. The sharks are the stars, and everyone involved with the movie knows that.'Deep Blue Sea' is not a classic movie, but it delivers in its own modest way.

Warning: This review contains some spoilers, so don't read it if you haven't yet seen the movie.This movie really has a predictable story. For example the shark killing techniques have been stolen from the JAWS series (blowing up a shark, elektrocution). There's a slowly flooding underwater research facility. The crew gets eaten one by one. All this we've seen before in other movies.Before I visited the movie I heard that the graphics (sharks) would be magnificent. Well, they're not! Although they look nice, they swim much to fast (even for big sharks) and move very unreal.The one good scene in this movie was the scene in which Samuel Jackson gets eaten. He has this very convincing dialog about why the crew shouldn't begin fighting eachother. You would expect him to take the lead role, kill all the sharks and be the only survivor. But just after his dialog he simply gets eaten... It was simply great! May the force be with him (oops, wrong movie...)One last remark about the ending of the movie. All of a sudden the storm has gone, which in my opinion happened a bit to fast. And even though LL Cool J gets bitten by a shark and should be wounded very badly AND Saffron Burrows get totally eaten by the last shark, the two surviving men don't suffer from any trauma. They even make some jokes. That's a real Hollywood ending.... Yuck....",Deep Blue Sea
352,hannah-4,dialogue written by intelligent sharks would have been better,8,28 July 1999,"The major failing of this movie lies in the pathetic dialogue.  You can see the actors straining so hard to be convincing while being forced to mouth insipid one-liners when a shark appears.  The characters neatly fit into creature-feature archetypes set down long ago in the Alien movies (with LL Cool J doing a passable impersonation of Charles-Dutton-meets-Yaphet-Kotto.) But some fun plotting turns the unoriginal characterizations to the film's advantage.  Playing the ""who gets eaten next?"" game has rarely been this challenging.

Shark movies are usually released straight to video, 'Shark Zone', 'Shark Hunter', anyone? Whilst 'Shark Hunter' hovers on the totally abysmal side Deep Blue Sea hovers more towards Jaws but is severely let down due to the lack of development in story.The concept is simple. An underwater science facility is taken over by the sharks. Although the idea may see ridiculous it can be bought. However the problem is, that whilst the sharks get smarter the movie borders on idiotic. The writing just isn't tight enough to hold the audience's attention. The dialogue is partly cheesy and the characters are people you would see in your regular 'B-movies.' You don't really care much for them. On the plus side though, there are some truly great sequences.For those expecting something as good as 'Jaws' this movie isn't really recommended. However with the right junk food and a group of friends, Deep Blue Sea is perfect as a guilty treat. Just remember, do not expect a movie of similar quality to Citizen Kane.

365,anjusabu,Probably one of the best shark movies,8,17 November 2017,"I really loved this film and could probably watch it over and over because I love creature films but most creature films are filled with crappy effects and a lesser- known cast. While 'Jaws' was a classic and a league of its own, this was fast-paced with lots of shark action and had good/realistic effects. When you compare it to the many many cheesy shark films out there, this one doesn't deserve the low rating.",Deep Blue Sea
366,lmdinicola,Compared to jaws.... Meh,7,16 August 2020,"I've seen this movie many times before. However just watched it again last night with my wife. It's neat how you catch certain flaws or info you missed every time you watch the movie.
Honestly, the only reason why we rewatched the movie again is number 1... LL Cool J is the best in this film..he creates the comedy which the film needed. And number 2.. I wanted to watch the 3rd Deep Blue Sea, but the wife wants to watch the first and second. I don't think the 3 have any relation, but whatever. Shark movies are fun to watch regardless.",Deep Blue Sea
367,Shifty,Cheap thrills on a big budget,7,17 August 1999,"Deep Blue Sea is a B-movie disguised as a ""Summer Blockbuster Action Thriller."" If you're old enough to remember watching a flick at the drive-in on a Saturday night double date this is the kind of movie that made you look forward to weekends. Of course the 90s equivalent is a little different, we have to take into consideration the technology film makers employ today (special effects), audience expectations (special effects), and add production value (very expensive special effects)Deep Blue Sea is all about cheap thrills on a big budget and I dare you to not get a charge out of  it even if you're inclined to drive, or walk out well before the credits roll.A beautiful marine biologist (Saffron Burrows) may have discovered the key to a cure for Alzheimer's: a protein extracted from the brain fluid of mako sharks. The problem is a shark's brain isn't large enough to secrete enough of the protein for clinical testing. Solution: genetically increase the size of the shark's grey material. A side effect she fails to mention to her staff and corporate backers is this also increases the shark's intelligence fivefold. Samuel L. Jackson plays the visiting CEO more like he's playing the straight man instead of acting the part, which is just what his character calls for. The rest of the cast include the swashbuckling shark wrangler (Thomas Jane), the assistant researchers (Stellan Skarsgard, Jacqueline McKenzie), the math whiz engineer (Michael Rapaport), and in the juiciest role of all LL Cool J as the lab's cook. He also has the best lines in a dubious script, as a bible quoting born-again with a parrot for a best friend.The story takes place within a vast underwater military submarine installation converted to a marine biological research complex and shark pen. When a gale blows in one night isolating the complex and its inhabitants the three mensa makos seize the opportunity to wreak havoc and in the process ingest, maim and out-smart the hapless researchers while turning the complex to rubble.Director Renny Harlin, who made Die Hard2 and Cliffhanger has put together a tight thriller that is essentially one action sequence after another. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than a snazzy rip-off of some of the genre's best and it doesn't have to. Harlin gets the job done effectively and professionally. Deep Blue Sea isn't one of the wannabe retread thrillers you might expect. Its originality is most apparent in the rules it breaks not the rules it follows. To say more would give away too much.Harlin pays homage to Jaws in the very first scene -- Night time. Teens on a catamaran at sea making out and boozing it up. Cut to dorsal fin gliding across the surface -- soon after he gets down to the business at hand, which is more Jurassic Shark than Jaws. You better not play with Mother Nature.
Once the action starts it's a roller coaster ride that doesn't let up and Harlin gives his cast members a one way ticket to a no win situation then sits back and watches them squirm. One of the most refreshing elements of Deep Blue Sea is its complete lack of predictability: anyone can die at any time. Don't be surprised to see lovely Saffron Burrows having played in this year's Loss of Sexual Innocence confronting an angry shark dressed in nothing but a skimpy bikini bra and panties. Or that LL Cool J during a tense cat-and-mouse sequence with one of the makos seeks refuge in an oven, which the shark promptly turns on. (I told you this is B-movie material at its best.). There is one ""gotcha"" scene in this film that's worth the price of admission alone.  The sharks themselves come in two varieties, mechanical and computer generated. The mechanical ones are life-like believable and used in medium and close up shots (Spielberg would have given an arm and a leg for one back in 1975, not his appendages of course, a cast member's.). The computer generated sharks move in ways a real shark never would. And correct me if I'm wrong but I don't believe sharks can swim backwards as the computer generated models suggest. Not that it matters much because you did suspend your disbelief before you rolled down the window and hung the speaker. Didn't you?",Deep Blue Sea
368,Sierra-6,Category should be joke/farce...,2,29 July 1999,"Give me a break! Even the shark in ""Jaws"", which was after all created over 20 years ago, was more convincing - and the movie therefore more suspenseful - than these lame-looking creatures with way too many teeth. Considering the kind of computer technology that is available these days and how convincing things can be depicted with it (e.g. ""Deep Impact"", ""Titanic"", ""Jurassic Park""), it is really a shame that this movie was done in such a sloppy fashion. The attack scenes look so fake that one is tempted to burst out in laughter - or leave the theater and ask for a refund. And, just because the sharks were created with computers, why do they all of the sudden have to move around in the water like a bunch of video game characters that are being maneuvered with the help of joysticks??The majority of the dialogue is worth ignoring and Samuel Jackson's character's preaching is totally corny. Why on earth did he choose to be part of such a movie? The part certainly wasn't challenging and it's not like the plot (uhm, what plot?) could have blown him away. Well, I guess with some actors you just have to question their judgment when it comes to their choice in roles.The only thing that's even remotely entertaining about that movie is LL Cool J's character - on account of LL Cool J's character and his ""redeeming"" qualities in the movie I refrained from giving the movie a 1 and gave it a 2 instead.The other good thing about this movie is that you don't have to worry about missing anything in case you need to take a break (if you know what I mean) - you can leave at any time and just pick up once you get back (if you decide to come back, that is).",Deep Blue Sea

And the character with the most annoyingly corny lines is Samuel Jackson. Why on earth did he decide to participate in such a movie?

370,Holst,"Not ""Jaws"", but not bad",7,2 August 1999,"""Jaws""'s status as the best horror movie ever (in my opinion) is in no danger of being displaced by ""Deep Blue Sea"", but I was surprised to be clinching my seat during many parts of the movie.  I've always thought director Renny Harlin was skilled at putting together a good action scene but ignores characterization and lacks subtlety (just compare McTiernan's Die Hard I and Harlin's Die Hard II), and in those respects this movie was not all that different.  However, the movie was so technically brilliant that you can't help being impressed.  The helicopter rescue near beginning was one of the best I've seen in recent years, with the many different catastrophic elements compounding into the inevitable ""we're trapped!"" situation.  The animatronic sharks were the best ever put on celluloid; ironically I thought some of the CGI sharks were less realistic by comparison.   The story had enough twists that it wasn't completely unpredictable; the whole play with ""brothers die first in horror movies"" was great.It could have been MUCH better, though.  I think that one thing a lot of film directors/producers/writers do not understand is that realism and cerebral elements CAN exist in action or horror movies.  This movie came up with an interesting concept (using shark brain to cure Alzheimer's disease), but didn't go very far with it.  The writers seem so caught up with keeping the audience guessing as to who will be shark dinner next that they ignored the premise of the movie.  The film moved so very matter-of-factly (for some reason I wasn't convinced that any of the characters were in shock of the predicament they were in) that tension was built by action elements rather than story elements.  Some good foreshadowing and symbolism could have built up the tension a lot more.  Still, it was an enjoyable flick and good for a few good scares.",Deep Blue Sea

372,Rimz,Worst Movie of the Summer,1,7 August 1999,"This was by far, the worst movie I had seen this summer.  First of all, this was the most predictable movie I had ever seen.  You start out with 8 actors, and you know most of them will die.  But it is so obvious, who will survive.  In these kinds of movie, the comic relief never gets killed, and neither does the main character.  The comedian always comes very close to dying and somehow, always narrowly escapes. Besides being very predictable, this movie was a plain rip-off of Jurassic Park.  Just change the dinosaurs to smart sharks.  Just think about it.Jurassic Park: Genetically created dinosaurs are being safely contained (yeah right) in their cages.  Then, after a small crew is left on the island, a hurricane hits, leading to a chain of events to the dinosaurs escaping and hunting the remaining people on the island.Deep Blue Sea: Genetically engineered sharks are being safely contained (yeah right) in their cages.  Then, after a small crew is left on the submarine pin - turned Aquatic base, a hurricane hits, leading to a chain of events to the sharks escaping and hunting the remaining people on Aquatic. Sound a bit familiar?Well, this movie might be entertaining to some people.  If you are looking for a no brainer popcorn movie this summer, then I guess you would go see it.  But for me, it was a complete waste of time.  Save your $9 and go see Eyes Wide Shut.  Deep Blue Sea.............2",Deep Blue Sea

I have been disappointed by many movies this year and I'll just say Deep Blue Sea didn't do such a thing.  I was extremely satisfied with every portion of this movie.  Although I had trust it would be good due to the fact that Harlin was directing it, I was a bit skeptical due to the horrid Wild Wild West which was directed by Sonnenfeld, who I like.  Anyways, this movie starts out slow (not boring), and about 30 minutes or so into it, bam! What a thrill ride.  Aliens rip-off? Maybe.  But who cares? In my opinion this is PURE entertainment.  It is the only movie in a LONG time that has had me guessing who was going to die in what order.  And what I had guessed, was TOTALLY wrong.  The mechanical/real sharks look fantastic, and although the CGI sharks were a little dated, they didn't effect the movie one bit. Harlin's direction is slick, and from the first action sequence we don't get a breather until the closing credits.  There is a scene in the middle of the movie, that I just can't get outta my mind, its brilliant and everybody in the theater was screaming.  The score by Trevor Rabin is surprisingly good and all the acting is decent or better.  Also, the only part of this movie I wasn't looking forward to was the fact that LL Cool J was in it.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised, he did a great job.  Anyways, enough about this movie.  Maybe its not that exciting, but it just seems that way due to the fact that we haven't seen anything good from this genre for a while. Anyhow, I definitely recommend this film to any action or horror fan, and I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did.  9/10",Deep Blue Sea

The plot did not depend on a government cover up or anyone or thing from outer space or anything supernatural.

The human chomp clips were fun to watch and I was surprised during one scene.  But other than that this film was just a crock.  LL Cool J should have been killed at least 3 times, not to mention Thomas Jane's (hard to believe he was Todd in Boogie Nights) final miracle.  But we are talking about Renny Harlin here.

In fact, I thought it was even better than Jaws!!  I know I'll get a lot of flack for saying that, but that's just my opinion.  ""Deep Blue Sea"" had to be one of the best films of 1999.  The situation the scientists and other people in the facility had to face was interesting, and since the movie was action packed, I was never bored. These sharks really were a threat.  For one thing (**slight spoiler**), they had enough intelligence to wipe out every human being in the facility and be set free, and secondly, their massive size and strength was enough to make sure their plans were carried out.  I have to admit, some of the special effects were bad, but the overall movie was great.  Even though the sharks made the movie exciting, and Samuel L. Jackson's performance was great, the best thing about this movie was the ever-so-fine LL Cool J (the fact that LL was in this movie is what got me interested in it in the first place). This is the movie that really catapulted him into films.  In fact, almost every movie critic gave him praise for this film, and he deserved it.  He stole every scene he was in.  This movie and the movie ""In Too Deep"" were his best films.  So, if you want to see a lot of action, gore, jump scenes, or if you want to just see LL Cool J in a good role, go out and see this film. Bye!!",Deep Blue Sea

Deep Blue Sea is an underrated horror movie but it's totally a great horror movie. I don't want to give spoiler alerts but Deep Blue Sea is about a group of Researchers who work at an undersea laboratory called Aquatica where somehow they genetically alter the brains of captive sharks to develop a potential cure for alzheimer's. However there is one unexpected side effect. The sharks get smarter. Which could mean troubled for the researchers and possibly dinner for the sharks. A tropical storm and one of the sharks causes a flood at Aquatica. Can they survive those very smart killing and thinking machines?

These sharks are so amazing they even have the ability to take down aircraft in flight. As far as the human characters, there is really no character development or anything, in most cases the people were unlikeable and I was rooting for the sharks.

The actors are not bad (except Michael Rapaport, i don't like his role). I think that the big problem is the FX. They can be very good (the shark who is trapped and where the scientists take cerebral spinal fluid) and very very bad (the scene where the bigs sharks eats the little). For me they are the biggest fault in this movie. And Renny who said that we can't make out the cgi and the animated sharks......... But the Fx are not ridiculous, they are not awesome that's all.

People kill shark. Movie is over. i know this because i love shark movies. The story above is in but not limited to all of the jaws movies(well all these other shark movies are pretty much fancy copies of the original jaws), the megaladon movies, the shark attack movies, red water,and pretty much everything except open water.

Instead, the girl surprisingly dies because of her stupidity(jumps in the water as bait so the shark gets closer to the boy so he can shoot it with a dynamite loaded spear gun). This movie, like jaws did at the time, has a new idea with some originality in it. This is a movie with a new idea and is very fun to watch. IT IS A GOOD MOVIE.

""Deep Blue Sea"" suffers from so many holes that is practically without substance to define them.  It should be viewed as a science comedy from the ""Man With Two Brains"" or ""Lake Placid"" genre rather than an action thriller.  While it is packed with action, most of the potential thrills are telegraphed thus divesting them of any surprise, with the notable exception of whom makes it to the second reel.Some of the larger holes are worth noting.  A team at a research lab located far out in the Pacific off southern California or Baja California develop large, intelligent Makos for use in Alzheimer's research.  Not only are the makos more like white pointers than makos, but with their increased intelligence comes incredible information.  The makos understand metallurgy and can differentiate between different kinds of steel.  They can understand the function and purpose of cameras.  They know the internal layout of the facility.  On the other end of the intelligence spectrum the humans seem to have lost some of theirs. Dr. Susan McAlester, leader of the research team, prepares to electrocute a shark by standing on her wet suit.  Well and good, but she is leaning against a wet wall.  The same Dr McAlester extracts a tissue sample from the brain of a shark and applies it directly to a tissue sample from the brain of a human affected by Alzheimer's disease.  In just six and a half seconds the human brain synapses begin to fire again. Truly amazing, since the sample was highly unlikely to have displayed any functions as a sample.The sharks also seem to have developed the capacity to alter size at will. They are huge in their containment pen, but  are able to swim down narrow corridors.The film is funnier than it is intended to be.  It is leaves you cheering for the sharks.",Deep Blue Sea

The beautiful mad scientist was played perfectly (distant and subtly unbalanced), the male lead was remote but sympathetic, and the sharks were genuinely scary. The movie was a little more gory than I expected, but I guess when you're dealing with a swimming eating machine, gore is to be expected. It certainly isn't a kids movie, but on the other hand there was no nudity at all -- a rare, rare thing in movies these days.",Deep Blue Sea
397,Razor-18,Not What I Expected,5,31 July 1999,"Can we say ""Con-Air"" meets ""Jaws"" in ""The Abyss""? As far as being an ""Alien"" rip-off...yeah I'll give it a little bit of that. And I agree that it isnt spectacular at all. I am sorry to say that this film will be thrown into a heap with other films that insist on using as many special effects as fiscally possible to impress the audience. However, I was impressed with a couple of FX feats and some of the cinematography I saw in the show. The FX sharks were well done and some of the underwater scenes were a first. I am fresh out of the theater so maybe someone else with a little more time on their hands could elaborate on my feeling that something was ""out of sync"" in this film. It was more than likely the plot. There are spots where you are left shaking your head at some of the character reactions to certain situations. Yeah, corny is a good word for it and can anybody else say ""inappropiate response""? LL Cool J seems to be getting a little more comfortable with acting but the ""brutha always gettin' it in the end"" act was a bore. We humans both white and black don't need that stereotypical rubbish anymore except when its intention is to make us, both black and white, laugh. Also Samuel L. Jacksons character being pretty much an outsider to the ""experiment"" doesn't spend enough time being boggled by the situation he is thrust into. Doesn't struggle with it enough...was too accepting of his place in the situation. And there was this constant blaring of the soundtrack which was, to me, was a little too overbearing and intrusive to some scenes. Oh, I know why....can we say ""Con Air"" again? See who did the soundtrack to Con Air. I'm just not a big fan of films that use overbearing, unnecessary glory shots and loud, mind numbing music to make scenes or characters look bigger than they need to be. In this case they used the soundtrack to do that. Come on Mr. Rabin, sometimes subtlety works. As for the characters, it seemed that once their character type was established they would go schizo and turn into someone else for a scene or two. They just seemed off balance at times. I don't know....I am just so disappointed to go to see a film and have the films FX and overintensity rob me of what my own imagination could have easily done. I want to see a horror/sci-fi film and have it let *ME* scare the sh*t out of myself. Alien did that...Dallas in the ventilation shafts? And there was *NO* soundtrack blaring during these scenes in Alien. I think that the more whizbang razzle dazzle you put into a film to scare people the less the audience will be scared and participate with the film. They walk out of the theater feeling like they weren't allowed to imagine anything. Anyway, sorry about the rant...I gave it a vote of 5 and it didn't make me any more fearful of deep, dark water, tight spaces (I am a caver so that won't work on me) and sharks than I was before I went to see it. It could have been much better than it was with talent from T2. I think Renny Harlins best film so far was Long Kiss Goodnight.

For some odd reason people expect this to be Kurosawas ""Ran"" on stereoids.Deep Blue Sea does exactly what it is supposed to do, give you a fast, action packed, ride on the other side of imagination. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and believe me I have seen a few . ..Deep Blue Sea sucks you in from the start of the movie and never lets you go, until the credits that is, and even then you might be seeing some quite odd dreams next night.So it hasn't got a involving story line, so it does not make you feel a better person, so you dont cry over some dramatic moment, so what ?Deep Blue Sea gives you ""bang"" for your bucks, what are you expecting from a action movie anyway ?Go there, watch it, be scared s***ess, and enjoy every minute of it !",Deep Blue Sea
400,Dr. Bill-2,We always knew the fish were smarter!,7,15 August 1999,"I went to see DEEP BLUE SEA thinking I was in for another no-brainer evening at the movies.  In some ways I got what I expected--the characters are hardly ""deep,"" the dialogue often strays into cliche, and the outcome is in some ways predictable. But what grabbed me after a few minutes--and held me to the end--was the energy of the film and the genuine surprises.  There are some real scares in the film (for those of us who like  that), and the pacing is superb.  There literally isn't a dull moment.  And, yes, I did find myself thinking afterwards about topics like genetic engineering--about how ""real"" this film might actually be in the not to distant future.As for the actors--this is a fine ensemble effort.  While there are some ""big names"" mixed into the cast--LL Cool J and Samuel Jackson--no one person dominates the screen.  Although I missed individual character development, what I did get was the sense of a group trying to outsmart an often unseen enemy, a group in an increasingly claustrophobic environment working against time and the ravaging force of nature. For a Summer popcorn movie, I was pleasantly surprised and very entertained.",Deep Blue Sea

What can you say about a film that takes its plot ideas from ""Jaws"" to ""Jurassic Park"" to ""Psycho"". Not a whole lot. The film makers could have at least spent more money on the digital effects to make the sharks more believable.

404,arrondee,Should have used dolphins,3,13 December 1999,"Well it seems that Hollywood had an idea to take 3 blockbuster hits: The Poseidon Adventure, Jaws, and Aliens and put them all together to make this movie, thus having a moneymaking smash on their hands. Alas this movie falls way short of the suspense and excitement of any of those features. The plot concerns a mixed bunch of people at a hi-tech ocean research centre where they are finding a cure for Alzheimers disease by experimenting on sharks( if it had been dolphins there would have been no movie as dolphins have no teeth). And this is a hi-tech facility folks  ""the fence is made from a titanium based metal"" we are told -wow!! Unfortunately technological advances don't extend to weather forecasting, and, what was to have been a minor squall, develops into a full blooded storm leaving our small bunch stranded on the center with no communications and a 48 hour wait before they can be rescued. Yes once again it is "" guess who will survive time"" and you may want to amuse yourself with side bets on who will be killed next. As none of the characters are particularly endearing, you find yourself not caring who lives or dies as the sharks relentlessly hunt our heroes down. Nevertheless, they still manage to joke there way through it with some lighthearted dialogue after each graphic death. Samuel L Jackson looks suitably embarrassed to be appearing in this movie while the rest of the cast is instantly forgettable. The survivors may have been lawyers in a previous profession and are spared by the sharks as professional courtesy. Do yourself a favour and see any of the 3 titles I mentioned at the beginning instead of this. The only glimmer of hope is that Leslie Neilsen will make a spoof of this movie in the future and give us a lot of laughs.",Deep Blue Sea

""Well, another film about sharks that go on a killing spree, how good can this be?""And indeed, this will, in my opinion, never become a classic. But if you are looking for a few hours of entertainment and are not afraid to be shocked, hire this one and you will not be disappointed. At least it had me on the edge of my seat. The images of the sharks, swimming through the corridors, the moments of shock (which you always try to anticipate, but never can to a full), the struggle of the scientists to get out of the facility (which called ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to mind), all very chilling.I particularly liked the decor in which the film is set (an abandoned WO II submarine facility). The fact that the evil/stupid scientist who lets things run out of control is a woman this time, is a refreshing new element.

Granted, its just supposed to mindless summer fun, but it was a little too mindless and not fun enough by far. The movie has only one decent scene (which will go nameless for the sake of those who haven't yet seen the film) and two good characters (those played by Sam Jackson and LL Cool J).  The sharks looked fake and the shark attacks were incredibly preposterous.  Renny Harlin was pretty much sleepwalking through this one (I did enjoy most of his other films).  Really nothing new going on here.I was constantly comparing Deep Blue Sea with a similar film that I saw recently:  Deep Rising.  Deep Blue Sea came off poorer in every category, mainly because I found Deep Rising to be wittier and fresher than this tired traditional fare.  Neither is particularly scary, but Deep Rising is at least amusing (in a good tongue-in-cheek kind of way).",Deep Blue Sea

What's there to say then? I found Deep Blue Sea quit unrealistic, not very scary, sometimes even a bit silly. The movie is molded in the same form that the majority of cheap horror movies since the dawn of the genre. The plot is weak; you never feel for any of the characters. What's there to keep after this? Maybe it is the plot being so classic that is the strength of the movie. Harlin changes a couple of things in the mold, and succeeds in surprising me. My favourite scene has to be; spoiler warning; the one where Samuel L. Jacksons character starts to give a great speech about how the group should stick together when things are going bad, and the second he has finished a shark comes and bites his torso right off. Hysterically funny and brilliant scene.",Deep Blue Sea
409,TheRealRogueSpider,Just the average slasher film...but with sharks,6,12 August 2000,"I normally judge a film by how it relates to its genre (2 points), if I'd recommend it to someone (3 points), and how well I liked it (5 points).First, let me start off by saying this film was aiming for a horror/thriller type audience. It definately achieved horror, as in the average slasher film -- lots of blood, gore, violent means of death, etc. The only thing that makes it different from the factory bred slasher movies is how the killers are sharks. But the thing that the crew is actually running from is the hordes of incoming water, which is how the sharks get around the place and bring the victims into their world, where they become extremely vulnerable, a nice little aspect, and I appreciate this.
But, the sharks don't just chase the crew and devour them, they kill/attempt to kill them with sometimes human methods (such as how when one of the crew locked himself in an oven to get away and the shark turned the dial to activate the heat, to possible fry the crew member, rather than try to break in -- and how instead of crushing the large front window, used an object to crack it and cause the pressure to do the job for them, etc.) I liked this aspect, it really made the sharks look ""smart"" rather than stupid carnivorous animals.As for the film being a thriller, it didn't grip me. I was never truly waiting for something to pop out of the door. The only real thing that boosted the thriller type aspect was the water that would break through walls and doors at any given moment. Horror, yes, thriller, almost -- but by ""that much"". 1 point out of 2.As for recommending it. I wouldn't say, ""Hell yeah, it's a hit, go see it now"", but I wouldn't say ""It sucks...you're better off just using it to tame your girlfriend into thinking you're all tough and nothing scares you. (for guys into dinner and a movie)"" So, it gets a 2 out of 3 for that.Did I like it? I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, it was just the average performance. What saved it from being a total flop, in my opinion, was LL Cool J's performance as the crew's chef, Preacher, bringing the lighter side of comedy with little tidbits of it -- most likely to lighten the mood. So, it gets a 3 out of 5.Finally, a total of 6 OUT OF 10, 1 out of 2 for genre, 2 out of 3 for recommending, and 3 out of 5 for how much I liked it.FINAL SUMMARY: A good idea, played out horribly...oh well, might as well watch ""Jaws"", it's the better shark film.",Deep Blue Sea

Now, Lake Placid was pretty damn stupid. It has some really bad dialogue.

415,thekinoman,Action and fun on parade!,8,13 December 2001,"For everyone who likes to see a well crafted horror/ adventure movie The Best: Renny Harlin proved once more his vein for directing action sequences, directing a memorable movie for its action proves. The most fantastic instrumental score composed by the grand Trevor Rabin; and the talented cast. The Worst: LL Cool J's character as a bit overdone role, they abused the comedy factor with  him. The cinematography was also awful  based on green tones which looked very bad.Susan McAlester a ruthless scientist that is very pledged in discovering the cure to Alzheimer disease, which vitimated her father. The experiences to the cure are developed in a floating base, because it his believed that the answer is on the sharks brain so the scientists vaguely augmented to get more proteins, but by doing this the sharks got bigger, smarter, faster and meaner. Among the scientists team are Janice, marine biologist; Tom Scoggins, computer expert; Carter Blake, Shark wrangler, Jim, Susan's right arm (until the main experience[eh, eh, eh]) and Russell Franklin experiencefinancer.Calling Renny Harlin to direct this movie was probably a nice touch as the producers seemed to be anticipating the final result of the film silly action, horror and adventure film, Jan De Bont would have been better though. But the better thing although was Trevor Rabin's score that very swiftly provides de action support to the sequences, helps very successfully building the tension. Pay close attention to this score its absolutely fantastic. The cinematography, although might have been the worst thing, it had the colors based on green which didn't help at all. The special effects may impress for the first time you see the movie, but afterwards you start noticing some inconsistencies. The sound isn't quite promising, nor brakes a new ground in sound industry (if you want a life time changing sound in a movie, see the Haunting) The movie was going very well but was a little spoiled by the ending a little mission impossible like I would say., but anyway it doesn't It  is still very very worth watching for the cast, music, directing, tension, action and horror scenes, jump scenes, pay close attention on the two main cast actors, Thomas Jane, (Carter Blake) and Saffron Burrows (Susan McAlester).8/10",Deep Blue Sea

What I did not expect to experience was a metamorphosis of sorts, this movie was my chrysalis.First, we will start with the characters. It's not often you see such human characters. I feel like I can walk across so many of these characters on the street during my daily shark solicitations. LL Cool J delivered the stellar performance we all expected of him, truly no surprises there. On to Bird, I did NOT expect to see Bird in this movie. I enjoyed Bird's performances in almost all of their works (*see Birdemic) but did not expect them to be in a shark movie of all things. Excellent choice by the casting director.Ok but SHARKS. Can we talk about these sharks please, will you allow me this one crumb of discussion topic. So I heard about some BTS drama with sharks number 3 and 2. I heard that that original shot with the license plate in the sharks mouth was completely accidental (some even suggest shark 1 had something to do with it), but I think we can all agree the levels of depth that this scene added to all the characters.Samuel L Jackson.I had a bag of McDonald's next to me when watching. I was told to throw it away and I agree as I found it quite distracting from the film.

Seriously this movie was so poorly made it made me laugh at how much the special effects crew or who ever else was responsible for the designs and animations of the sharks knew about shark biology because I'm seventeen and I'm smarter than adults, now that's funny, but if thought that this movie was better than JAWS, well it's time for you to reconsider why you like terrible movies in the first place.",Deep Blue Sea

What I got was a movie that was a rip-off of the Jaws series/Jurassic Park and anything else the writers could find. The sharks were carbon-copies of Jurassic's velociraptors. If someone tells you that this is an original movie, cover your ears and run---that person is insane. Not just were the sharks killed in roughly the same manner as in the Jaws movies (electrocuted, blown up), but they were almost killed in other ""already seen before ways"" (fire extinguishers, etc.).I understand that these characters are probably used to 40 foot sharks attacking them, but how about more than 5 min. of acting worried.  I read a review that said a few plot holes--what did they drink before seeing this. First of all, their escape plan has more holes than swiss cheese.

Or what about how the sharks can ram through steel doors, but not make it through this Superman-like ""titanium steel fence.""  And the sharks just happen to know what cameras are--and no one thinks anything is ""strange"" about this?  Obviously, Hollywood thinks that we're too stupid to understand a continuous plot.Then we come to the final scene.  The biggest letdown in the history of thrillers.  One of the heroes must be eating his wheaties b/c after being munched by one of those 40 ft. critters, he manages to recover from shock, find the gun, somehow crawl to a different area and  shoot the shark. Ummm, okay.  Also there's a scene where the hero decides to jump into the water and save somebody instead of shooting the shark--this person's too stupid to be a hero.  Then the scene where someone becomes ""bait"" for the shark. Let me see--I'm going to jump into the middle of the ocean so that I can't escape instead of swimming next to the edge so I can easily climb out.  Do you actually think the shark could tell the difference?  Unfortunately, I could (oh, I forgot, these are super-smart-Ivy League-sharks).I have to admit that I (and a lot of other sane individuals) laughed our way through and out of the movie.  Perhaps they should have marketed this as a comedy b/c if you go in with a clear head, you'll be smiling most of the time?",Deep Blue Sea
428,Naamah,"A ""Jaws"" echo that doesn't quite cut it...",3,30 July 1999,"I must first state that I grew up on ""Jaws"" movies and that I consider sharks to be scary as heck.  Despite the better looks of the sharks in ""Deep Blue Sea"" they just weren't as scary as the sharks in the ""Jaws"" movies. The opening scene of the movie came straight from ""Jaws 2"". The compoud where the movie takes place is a rip-off of ""Jaws 3"", in many ways, as is Carter the ""shark wrangler"".  The trek that the group has to make through the destroyed compound to the surface is a rip-off of ""The Poseidon Adventure"". The movements of the computer sharks are about the quality of the snake in the movie ""Anaconda"".  Overall, there was hardly anything original in the movie and the scares were few and far between.  The plot was mediocre and the deaths (of sharks and people) were passé and redundant, respectively.  In my humble opinion, the movie was full of more blood than ""close calls"" and that, as any good ""Jaws"" fan knows, is not what makes a good shark movie.",Deep Blue Sea

430,Limpy-2,Weak...very weak,2,1 August 1999,"Deep blue sea, to me was a somewhat pathetic attempt at bringing back the classic Jaws, and combining it with bits and pieces of Sphere.  The plot was quite weak, with very little evidence of how a shark (no matter how large it's brain) could so easily recognize, say, a surveillance camera.  Even the shark's brain was huge, how would it recognize a thing like this if it had never had experience with something like it? A man, no matter how smart, could not foil a surveillance camera if there was no possible way for him to know what it was.  Anyway, this movie, despite the lack of an original or well-thought plot, was somewhat entertaining, and if you're out for some action with nothing deep or meaningful behind it, then go watch this.

As for Renny Harlin, I hope he can make some profit on this one after the last two.By the way, if Speilberg was to have made JAWS in the 90's as opposed to the 70's, I'd bet a dime to a dollar that he would have used CGI sharks as well.",Deep Blue Sea

434,Eilifant,How bad can a movie get?,1,2 December 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** I can't remember a single scene in the entire movie that were even slightly believable. Smart sharks? OK. But how were they able to change their size(to get through the doors) and break those doors which can take tons of weight? How could they ""throw"" the stretcher, with the armless still breathing and fully awake professor 20m below the surface, about 10 meters trough water to break a underwater window. And why didn't the water flow faster through the completely broken 2x10 meter window? The room would have been filled in less than a second. I complete my frustrations by commenting the stupidity of the last surviving woman who were smart enough to kill one shark by electricution but had to sacrifice herself to lure the ""supersmart"" shark back to be shot by an well aimed shot. The shooter? A cook who had just survived a 20 second ""ride"" in the jaws of a shark resulting in the only visible injury of a small fleshwound. The chef who earlier had killed one shark by igniting some gas from an oven in the underwater kitchen. Coursing an enormous explosion which he himself of course survived. Finally, the other survivor had a last rendezvous with death by surviving another explosion caused by selfmade dynamite(gunpowder from signalflares). The shark was of course killed by this which could have sunk a russian submarine. The humanoid swam to shore almost unharmed.

441,valkore,What a sleeper..,4,9 August 2000,"I think there were about 5 seconds of tension in this movie.  The rest was filled with boring dialogue, or unbelievable action scenes.  I love it how the sharks instantly learn how to ram a stretcher through a glass window in order to break it, but become dumb as dirt when attacking the chef (played by none other than LL Cool J) or the female doctor.  As least they wisened up at the end and finally ate her.  But not before she strips down to an itsy bitsy white bra and panties combo, and electrocutes one by simply tearing off industrial strength cables from the wall, and insulating herself with a damp wetsuit.  Give... me... a... BREAK!Acting was below average.  Samuel L Jackson did his usual overly intense character.  Right before he got eaten, I could have sworn he was going to try to play the role of ""The Negotiator"" on the sharks.  The female doctor tried too hard to be some smart, yet tough and rebellious lead character. And the fish guy was the typical brooding anti-hero saving the day.  Top it off with some other fluff characters used solely to get eaten after spouting off pathetic lines.Then again, I guess we're supposed to turn our brains off and stretch our suspension of disbelief as far as humanly possible.

Well this movie is a bit like Jaws, there's some pi**ed off, smarter than average sharks after humans... The only thing is, Jaws had quality, Jaws is a classic. This movie has no quality what so ever, and it's only a classical example of how not to do it. The story is total nonsense, and only there as an excuse for showing the audience sharks eating people. The actors... well... this might be a spoiler, but the best actor dies after about 30 minutes, and with him dies the only reason to keep watching the movie. I assure you, LL Cool J is not that actor. He was put in this movie as the clown, for the people who can't understand the 'difficult plot'. Well, for a clown he's doing a very bad job, because he is not funny at all. And his acting... that was even worse than his jokes. If you look at the scenes removed from the movie that are somewhere on the DVD, and if you listen to the comments of the director, you see that some weird things in the plot would have been much clearer if the director would have just left those specific scenes in. But it also makes very clear that the director had hardly any idea what he was doing while making this movie.My advice, do NOT go to see this movie. If you are bored out of your mind, go read a book. If you want to see sharks, go see Jaws or the Discovery Channel. If your girlfriend ever rents this for you cause she thinks it was a great movie, break up with her.

446,MisterCritic,Computer graphics shark animation competition that went wrong.,2,8 June 2001,"I could not get a grip on this movie.  The movie is definitely not a candidate for the `dethronement' of JAWS as the ultimate in shark horror movies.  This is rather a sample movie for developers of  computer graphics software so that they (the developers) can establish what they have to improve about the software for future projects.  I'm not going to complain about the backwards swimming phenomenon of the sharks,  but the movie is just too unrealistic to digest and it is completely extra-terrestrial when you compare it to JAWS.  Okay, a film does not really have to be realistic and there are many people who love science fiction,  but it's usually the realistic films which are the more popular films at the end of the day.  Take JAWS for example:WARNING:  SPOILER JAWS has the realistc `human touch' where 3 ordinary men that we can associate with go out on a boat to hunt this great white that's terrorising the small coastal town where they live and where people have been attacked. (Sounds normal enough to me.)DBS is this fictional underwater base with sharks that grew intelligent as the result of an experiment that went wrong.  The sharks also form a `conspiracy' with their newly aquired intelligence to destroy the base and the human bait within. (This is very good science fiction with sharks that are clearly born on a computer screen) The last shark is blown up in the end as in  JAWS.  (That's one of the copycat parts...)SPOILER ENDThe film did manage to keep me on seat's edge,  because of the `dumb' humans' struggle to get out of the base.

Boy, was I wrong.If you are in the mood for almost 2 hours of mindless entertainment, then maybe, just maybe it's worth it. It has all the ingredients you expect from a effects driven action movie. A mindless collection of explosions, water, arguing main characters, the comic relief side kick, running from danger and plain stupidity.I was discussing movies with a friend a few days ago and I think he might be right in one thing. We have seen too many good movies to accept stupid plots and short cuts. Maybe it has ruined my ability to enjoy this kind of movies, but I don't think so. Sometimes I look for and enjoy some mindless action, but this was just too bad to be enjoyable. This was not good value for money, even if I got to see it for free.

450,emptyvoice,A Good Popcorn Flick **Possible Spoilers**,6,25 January 2004,"I just saw this movie on TV and it was definitely enjoyable. The plot wasn't deep by any standards. It was only there to provide a back story for the main point of the movie: a fight for survival against three giant, intelligent, and most definitely aggressive sharks.But the depth and cleverness of the plot, or lack thereof, doesn't matter in a movie where you have sharks literally throwing people underwater and turning oven knobs. These things might turn some people away but I think they show that the director was having a fun time with the movie. In the case of the oven knob, I think he was just getting a little silly, which is alright.One good thing about the film is that it doesn't always set up deaths in the cliched way that these disaster/animal attack films normally do. It keeps you guessing. There were was only one time when I was absolutely sure when the character was dead meat and that was just before they died. The way that death was set up was very well done because it seemed like the director intentionally built up that anticipation of the character's death to create tension. The character may as well have worn a sign saying, ""Shark Food."" That scene has a special place in my heart.All around, the acting was at least believable. There were no terrible actors in this movie. If there was an actor that wasn't as good as the rest, they were killed off earlier on. At least that's what it seemed like to me , but just like everyone else I have my own standards. Who knows what my opinion of Samuel L. Jackson is?Anyway, one of my biggest gripes with the movie is that the computer special effects are sometimes a little iffy (i.e. you can tell that they were done on a computer or they defy reality in some small way). Fortunately, those moments are relatively quick and brief, so they're not that prominent.One other problem I had is that the sharks change size. When they're out in the open water they are gigantic monsters capable of eating an entire human in one bite. Yet somehow they can manage to swim in the flooded hallways of the labs in waist deep water.Overall, despite its flaws and occasional silliness, I think it's a fun and exciting movie. My advice is to go rent the DVD or VHS, get a bowl of popcorn, turn off all the lights, clear your mind, and have a good time. That's the best way to watch a movie like Deep Blue Sea.My Vote - 6 out of 10",Deep Blue Sea

Even the most stupid movies have some redeeming quality to them, and sometimes you might even get the urge to watch them again. Well, that was anything but the case for me and ""Deep Blue Sea"".I remember seeing this movie on TV almost a year after it came out (1999, coincidentally the year of release for the abomination known only as ""The Haunting""), in a hotel room in Canberra, Australia. Virtually my entire family had gathered in one room for a celebration, and after hearing that ""Deep Blue Sea"" would be airing soon, we resolved to watch it out of curiosity. Perhaps we assumed that, as cheesy as we had heard it was, it would still be possible to take it seriously.All we did was laugh. Nobody, and I mean nobody, could help it.""Deep Blue Sea"" takes itself far too seriously for a suspense/action thriller involving bio-engineered sharks hunting down hapless human prey. It features an ""eclectic"" cast of stereotypical horror movie characters (portrayed by forgettable actors who deserve to remain nameless) who are predictably pursued by the shark in question and must fend for their survival in as moronic a way as possible without sacrificing the ""tension"" it works to create. Really now, why swim for your life when you can strip down to the bare essentials and show off some meaningless fan service to the camera? There are only loads of better movies to turn to than this one for that sort of thing, and heaven forbid that your clothes hinder your movement any. As for who dies and who doesn't, there are absolutely no surprises. If you know the clichés of the genre, they're all perfectly intact here. The ending? Pffft.

I went to see it mainly because of the director Renny Harlin which is one of my favorites. It was really good movie for a long time from Harlin ...well at some points actors didn't act very ""smoothly"" and the best actors of the movie were LL Cool J and Samuel L. Jackson...

To say this is Jurassic Park meets Jaws meets Aliens is an easy cop-out which is why I'll say it.  But if you watch closely, there is some fun being had at the expense of the action thriller genre.  Who will be the hero?  Who will live?  Who will die and how?  The writers know enough to play with your expectations in a very satisfying way. Perhaps they should have fleshed out the characters a bit more, but hey, what action movie does?

There were enough relatively unknown actors in the piece to make us feel that the characters were real people, like you or me, stuck out there in the claustrophobia of a world run horrifyingly amok with Sam Jackson up there showing them the ropes. The editing and effects are amazing, the music as menacing and beautiful as the sharks themselves and the acting fabulous. This film has no delusions of grandeur.

But it knows it's bad and doesn't try to be anything other than a cheesy, special-effects laden summer vechicle.  It has a refreshing lack of pretension--it's not trying to be the scariest movie ever.  I, proudly or not, was entertained, and that's what movies are supposed to do.  The writers/director did a good job in keeping you guessing as to who is going to get eaten next.  You can laugh at this movie, not with it, and it won't mind.  Furthermore, one of the death scenes is just pure brilliance (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). It has the requisite half-naked girl (Saffron Burrows) and the requisite half-naked boy (Thomas Jane).  The dialogue is, well, nothing important. But, who cares?! As long as you don't expect complex characters or an important storyline, and as long as you're just looking for 2 hours of entertainment, then this movie is for you.

What I got was much more.  With great effects, Die Hard genre action, and music by my personal favorite Trevor Rabin, this is easily one of my all-time favorites.  I also liked how the use of special effects were used to enhance the thrills and energy instead of trying to replace them.

One of the bad things about Deep Blue Sea is the cast, now i know that the director went for the lesser known stars instead of household names but the fact is that he chose the wrong cast....Saffron Burrows is very good in her role as the lead scientist but is a bit quiet and lacks the skill of making the audience actually concentrate and listen to what she is saying.

You can kind of predict the actors that are going to live but it takes enough turns and twists to make you rethink your guesses. I have read the previous comments and would love to know where the ""Alien rip off"" idea came from.  There were not very many well known actors in this movie, but if you look up the credits for the cast you will see that they are not exactly no names either.  I like the idea that they used a mix of well known actors with fresh new faces as well. This keeps you guessing because no one is going to stereotype the actors from roles they have seen them in previously. It is unlike any movie that I have seen.  Yes Jaws (the original) will always be ""The Shark Movie"" but Deep Blue Sea is on a totally different level.

478,mandy-35,Deep Blue Sea is deeply disappointing,1,4 August 1999,"This movie is beyond horrible!!!  Where do I begin?  Let's start with this:  Where did the idea that this movie is scarier than ""Jaws"" come from? There were not people actually screaming in the theater, as there were with ""Jaws"".  The special effects were not believable, because you could tell when things were fake.  In ""Jaws"" you could not tell, and that movie was made long before this one.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that our special effects technology had improved over the years. The whole course that the movie took was wrong.  The basis behind the tests on the sharks were so Susan could make a medication to fight Alzheimers.  But then all of her data and information were destroyed, so all the work was useless.  The development of that medication was supposed to be her driving force.  And, not to give it away to people who have not seen the movie, what was the point at all to what happened at the end, especially since there was the idea of a possible romance to end the movie?  And it was almost laughable at the way some of the actors in this movie came to their ends. My advice:  don't waste your money on seeing this movie.  It is not worth the time it fills.  You'll probably find that the previews you see before the movie are more entertaining than the actual movie itself.My only praise of the movie is that the actors and actresses played their parts as well as they could.

481,Jazz-47,Physics Takes a Coffee break...,3,4 August 1999,"... and so did the writers, it seems, for this film defies both dramatic symmetry, and plain common sense. The idea that anyone in their right minds would attempt such a project as the movie's premise suggests is silly in the extreme. Character motivations are not simply weak, they are laughably ridiculous. Even moreso, perhaps, because they are constantly re-stated and urgently argued by the scientist who has created the dangerous situation the characters find themselves in... long after the obviously dangerous results are thrown in her face. Whoever wrote this film has likely never once been diving, nor have they made any research at all into the biology of sharks. The only reason to see this movie is to watch LL Cool J, the best actor in the film. Even Samuel Jackson, normally a superb master of dialogue and pacing, comes across as wooden and misplaced. Perhaps because the other actors around him cannot work well in concert with him? Who knows... Every single action scene in the film is riddled with impossibilities and absurd conclusions. I spent a great deal of the film shaking my head and muttering, ""No, no... it wouldn't WORK like that... that's not just impossible, it's stupid..."" The effects sequences are awful, save for those incorporating mechanical or prop effects, those were nicely executed. Spielberg would probably look at the mechanical shark and sigh with jealousy, but the rest of the film is a joke. A bad joke. A joke with the audience as the punchline.

'Doesn't sound like it can be that bad', you might say. Well, it was dreadful. The acting was third-rate at best, with unrealistic portrayals of all characters. Samuel L.

The fact he has a secret isn't fore-shadowed at  all, and just sort of pops-up to add to the 'shock-factor'.

Even through in some parts of the film we can tell the robotic sharks from the CG sharks, the effects are quite good. The story never goes flat and there are all sorts of unexpected twists and turns. The cast clearly understood who their characters were as they acted incredibly well. The sharks followed how Makos act in the wild and don't go around like mindless killing machines. The story is based on fact as sharks do contain things in their blood and body cells that can help combat cancer. But I must admit, when the large female attacked Russell Franklin, I wasn't impressed as the large female shark didn't show much aggression as I would of wanted to see. But Carter was excellent in the shark scenes as it showed how man and shark confront each other. Indeed this movie stands out and I compare it to Jaws as the other shark movies aren't that good.

No it is not great compared to other movies, but when you compare it to other shark movies, it is very good for its type. My point is you will probably enjoy it more if you enjoy shark movies. For me it is my favorite movie of all time. Now for the pros and cons.Pros: Very good looking sharks, the models of the sharks look very well done, and the CGI isn't bad. The story was not hard to follow. The setting was also very well done, and looks nice. The story was believable (to me)Cons: The movie goes into little depth when getting to know the characters, you learn almost nothing about them. When a person is attacked by a shark, the CGI goes from good to terrible. There are some moments when you could easily get out of trouble within 5 seconds, but the characters choose a harder way out. (Ex, when the marine biologist falls in the water in the elevator shaft, and the ladder is right beside her, she instead tries to grab for Carters hand.) Just because the con list is longer than the pro's does not make this a bad movie.As said earlier, this is a better movie for shark lovers, but people looking for a good movie will be entertained too.",Deep Blue Sea

The sad part was saffron getting killed by sharks for her stupidity. The direction was not so great,though but I loved the background music and loves the Cook character.",Deep Blue Sea
509,dancemonkey66,it has a beginning and an end and an amazing plot,10,3 July 2005,This movie is awesome and is very graphic but it makes the movie extremely intense. The cast is awesome and fits the parts perfectly. In some parts of this movie you think what is wrong with him but in other parts you want to hide behind your pillow or you boyfriend and scream.(boyfriends are better because they think it's cute and then you might get some great make out session or you might get a little something something else you know what I'm talking about right SEX thats right you might get some hot steamy SEX) Have fun and hope you get to see this movie. This movie starts off happy but end in a gory scary breath taking denouement that just a Fancy word for end.,Deep Blue Sea
510,bpuryea-04980,Watch this as if they intended to make a comedy,4,9 August 2021,"Am I the only one that laughed out loud when Samuel Jackson gets eaten by the shark just as he finished his awe inspiring speech?Nah - all ya' all laughed, I know it, you know it, the whole world knows it.",Deep Blue Sea
511,ikegoodwin,"The Movie Was Terrible, but LL Cool J Blows Up Two Sharks",10,4 September 2017,"He really does. To be completely honest, LL Cool J is the only redeeming quality the movie has. ""Preacher,"" LL Cool J's character has two traits: he delivers sassy one-liners and believes in Jesus. It may be telling of the overall quality of the movie, but LL Cool J's character was better developed and more interesting than anything else that happens. The movie wants to be Jurassic Shark very badly, but failed miserably at delivering a comparable experience to Spielberg's classic. LL Cool J survives to the end, which was very important to me.tl;dr: Movie sucks, LL Cool J blows up two sharks, and I wish I was drunk when I watched it.",Deep Blue Sea
512,eeveeteam,Poor movie,3,9 April 2018,"I have to say, that was horrible. The CGI was poor. How the shark attacked the doctor, you can tell straight away it was not made well. It was fine in the beginning and the shark look fine until they start attacking. I'd say Jaw was much better than this movie, Deep Blue Sea. I gave it a shot and it didn't turn out well. Overall I'd say, ""Meh."" Meaning okay and not okay at the same time. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Don't watch it. But If you do, then go ahead",Deep Blue Sea
513,mlm_211,Pretty Good Movie,8,8 March 2006,"I thought Deep Blue Sea was one of the best shark movies created. I was very fascinated by the scientific part of the movie. The basis wasn't just on terror and blood. I think there's a real personal side to it for the lead character. She had watched her father suffer for years, and that drive and desire to prevent the same thing from happening to so many others gave the movie the obsession that it had. I found it refreshing that this movie had a woman obsessed with helping others instead of some risqué character obsessed with sex or violence. However, the other characters were not introduced to well. You never really found out anything about them. There were some suggestive hints about Carter having a background, but it was as if the movie left you hanging, or you got to make up whatever happened yourself.There were some bad points as well. Firstly, the relationships between the characters weren't consistent. One minute, it would seem that certain characters were just acquaintances or co-workers, and the next, they seemed to be such close friends. Though, I suppose a tragedy like that would have that effect on people. The other fact that gets me every time I watch the movie is how many times Carter falls down! Yes, sometimes it's unavoidable, but then, others, you can tell he randomly jumps and slides away. Every time they try to do anything, Carter is falling down. Also, what gets to me each time I see the movie is when the stretcher hits the window. All the cast members stand there watching. I know that if I were the room and that first chunk of glass had flown from the window, I wouldn't wait and see what happens next--I would have been running for the door long before they did.",Deep Blue Sea
