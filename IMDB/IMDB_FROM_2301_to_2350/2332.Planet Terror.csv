0,MartinHafer,Offensive and boring,3,25 March 2008,"I think that the concept that resulted in this movie and DEATH PROOF (marketed together under the banner ""Grindhouse"" in the USA) was fatally flawed, though interesting. These two films were a homage to the ultra-low budget shocker films of the 1970s that were marketed as double-features in sleazy theaters. These over the top 70s films often received X-ratings because they were so violent and explicit, though by today's standards they are often relatively tame. I've seen a few and was actually surprised that they weren't THAT bad. Some good examples of good ""grind-house"" films were the Sonny Chiba ""Streetfighter"" series and a few of the Blaxploitation films. While x-rated and super-violent, the stories were exciting and the action top-notch--and they have an artistic value not generally assumed to be possible in these style films.However, as I said, I think the idea is fatally flawed for two main reasons. The bad grind-house films sucked and always will suck--they were just brain-numbingly stupid, violent and sick--and this is totally true with PLANET TERROR. I simply think life is too short to watch sleazy crap (prime example--the attempted rape scene--UGGH!!). Second, there was a certain campiness in some of the films that was, at times, charming and a real product of the times. However, 30 years later, the times have changed and no matter how hard you try, you can't recreate the genre. Instead of cheap and funny, newer incarnations are different--mostly due to much higher budgets and an inability to capture the exact spirit and style. I can see that the director TRIED (especially by making the prints deliberately scratchy and including ultra-sleazy promos for fake coming attractions), but it isn't the same. Plus, I really DON'T find myself hoping that they'll make more of these films or want a steady diet of these nihilistic films. As for me, after about the 30th or 40th zombie corpse being shot to pieces or exploding when getting hit by a truck, I just felt incredibly bored by the whole thing. Rodriquez managed to make carnage and bloodshed dull. I also noticed my IQ drop the longer I watched this movie.For the love of God, if you actually like this sort of film, don't let your kids see it! They won't be right afterwards and you'll be responsible for creating a sociopath!!",Planet Terror
1,Leofwine_draca,Glorious throwback to the grindhouse days of old,9,12 October 2016,"Conceived as part of his Grindhouse double bill with Quentin Tarantino but released separately from Tarantino's DEATH PROOF internationally, PLANET TERROR is a glorious throwback to the schlocky exploitation days of the 1970s, where so-called 'grindhouse' cinemas played a series of low budget gore-filled 'nasties' to audiences eager for sex and sadism. Having seen many of the original exploitation films in question, I'm pleased to say that director Robert Rodriguez gets it spot on and the look and feel of this film is just right.Things kick off on a high note with Rose McGowan go-go dancing. I've never been a fan of this actress, but that's changed right here with the role she has. She's perfectly cast as the tough yet vulnerable dancer who loses a limb but gains a weapon in the zombie attack, and it helps that she's as hot as hell. The one thing I loved straight away was the soundtrack, especially the main theme with the saxophone playing – great stuff that had me humming along.Anyway, the film that follows is a simple story of a zombie attack, starting off isolated incidents and building into an all-out zombie rampage. The usual scenarios are present, from the survivors holed up in a deserted diner to the killer soldiers involved in a cover-up. PLANET TERROR has few twists, instead it lets the narrative drive itself with a series of outlandish action sequences which are thoroughly entertaining. The biggest treat, though, lies in this film's casting; Rodriguez seems to have assembled a bunch of stars, old and new, A-list and B-list, and they come together nicely. I won't go through the bother of listing them all - the cast list is available right here on IMDb - only to say that Michael Biehn and Jeff Fahey really stand out as the kooky brothers, the latter particularly fine after years of being stuck in B-movie limbo. The gooey gore comes thick and fast and only a few scenes descend into inanity; the Tarantino cameo is a bit of a disappointment but the rest works gloriously well.",Planet Terror
2,SnoopyStyle,really nice B-movie,7,1 January 2016,"Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) quits her go-go dancing job. Cherry runs into her ex El Wray (Freddy Rodríguez) at a roadside bar run by J.T. (Jeff Fahey). Ruthless gang leader Abby (Naveen Andrews) has some experimental gas. Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) double-crosses him. He shoots the canisters releasing the gas. The gas descends on the neighboring town turning people into crazed killers. Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his wife Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton) treat a patient with strange ailments. Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) leads the ragtag group of survivors against the rampaging mob.I like the start with McGowan and Abby's love of testicles. As the movie moves on, I feel like it is trying to follow too many lead characters. Robert Rodriguez has a very well-made B-movie with a veneer of Grindhouse effects. It's a lot of guts, gore, explosions and destruction. The middle is a little over-extended but it is good fun.",Planet Terror
3,claudio_carvalho,Total Cult,8,2 April 2008,"In Texas, the gang leaded by the black market dealer Abby (Naveen Andrews) faces a group of renegade militaries leaded by Captain Muldoon (Bruce Willis) in an abandoned military base. During their shootout, Abby shoots a recipient of biological weapon, releasing an experimental highly-contagious gas that turns humans to flesh-eating zombies. Meanwhile, in the local hospital, Dr. Block (Josh Brolin) sees an epidemic with many patients with the same nasty symptoms. When the outbreak affects most of the local population, a group of people with immunity leaded by the mechanic Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn), the stripper Cherry (Rose McGowan) and the Dr. Dakota (Marley Shelton) fight to survive and become the last hope to save the world.The stylish, gore and hilarious ""Planet Terror"" has a great potential of cult-movie, with an immediate association with ""Braindead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"". Robert Rodriguez basically updated the storyline of George Romero's trilogy; cast a great group of actors and actresses and added lots and lots of blood and top notch special effects. The result is one of the funniest movies I have recently seen. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Planeta Terror"" (""Planet Terror"")",Planet Terror
4,kosmasp,Sick & filthy,7,10 October 2007,"And I still kinda loved it despite of that fact ... or maybe because of it? I can't tell you, but I can tell you that viewers discretion is advised! You thought ""From Dusk till Dawn"" (FDTD) went to far? You haven't seen anything yet, I'd say! But as in FDTD, this is all shown in a hilarious silly way, so it can't be taken seriously (being a Grindhouse homage, one could expect that), because it's just so over the top ...The story is nice for a b-movie, but it does seem to have a lot of breaks. At least that's what I thought. The pace is not really helping that either. And although this too, is something that was an ingredient to Grindhouse movies, I did hope that it wouldn't be an issue as it unfortunately is ... With 90 minutes (and a reel missing), it still feels too long ... Nevertheless, I had my fun watching it!",Planet Terror
5,gavin6942,"The Best Film of 2007, Hands Down",7,12 October 2007,"Terrorists and the military square off in a small town for a chemical that chemically alters humanity into... something awful. A chemical somehow connected to Osama bin Laden. Getting caught up in this are the local police, a wrecker, a go-go dancer turned comedienne and a local cook with a very special barbecue recipe. Oh my, what will become of them? In the theater, this film was the first half of ""Grindhouse"", and by far the more action-packed one (""Death Proof"" being the other half). And there's a drastic difference -- ""Death Proof"" has the dialogue and the superior music, but ""Planet Terror"" has the action, the blood, the humor and the pure campiness people were coming to see.The cast makes this film. Freddy Rodríguez (who is like a handsome John Leguizamo) plays the lead -- El Wray, a man with a secret past (geniusly removed from the plot by a ""missing reel""). His right-hand woman (or, more accurately, his right-legged woman) is Rose McGowan playing Cherry Darling. While McGowan was alright in ""Death Proof"", she shines here -- more action, a better, sexier appearance. She is awesome with her stunt leg (first a wooden peg and later a machine gun). I understand this was edited in later with computers, but it looks good and she was crucial to everything lining up right.Marley Shelton is Dr. Dakota Block, who also appears in ""Death Proof"" (as do the Parks father-son team as the McGraw cops we've seen before in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Kill Bill""). Her husband is the deranged Dr. Willam Block (played by Josh Brolin, who has a very Kurt Russellesque look here). Doc Block was a great addition to the story - -a subplot that didn't need to even be here but added something important... I can't put my finger on it.Naveen Andrews (probably best known from TV's ""Lost"") is Abby, and English terrorist obsessed with collecting enemies' testicles. This has to be one of the strangest parts of the film, but it's really funny and not at all nonsense like it would be in any other film. Horror veteran Tom Savini plays Deputy Tolo. He was great, of course.Electra and Elise Avellan were the babysitter twins. When they first showed up, I thought they were stupid characters, but they provide more necessary comic relief and can be vicious if provoked. Speaking of vicious, Quentin Tarantino plays ""The Rapist"", but sadly isn't all that impressive. He isn't really given the chance to indulge in his style of rambling that makes him lovable. His scene -- unnecessary.Stacy ""Fergie"" Ferguson is here. Horror icon Jeff Fahey is here (and soon to be joining Naveen Andrews on ""Lost""). Did I mention Bruce Willis is here playing Lt. Muldoon? Because he is. And he has one of the best lines in the movie, simply on how he delivers it (with a pause that would make William Shatner jealous).Watch ""Death Proof"" if you want strong dialog and a throwback to crappy car chase movies of the 1970s. If you want action, sexuality (McGowan's hottest role since ""Doom Generation""?) and more blood than I've ever seen in one movie in my life -- trucks and even helicopters plowing through bodies like a hot knife through a foreskin during a bris. I sincerely believe this is the best film of 2007 and I stand firm on that. After watching over 300 films this year, I don't need November or December to know what I'm talking about. Catch this one like Ash on a Pokemon.",Planet Terror
6,jboothmillard,Planet Terror,5,14 March 2008,"I had heard about something by producer, writer and director Quentin Tarantino called Grindhouse, and then I had heard that along with his Death Proof, this film from director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) originally joined it at US cinemas as a double-bill/feature. Basically this is a homage to cheap horror flicks, and you can tell this from the purposely jumpy, missing reel and flickering picture. I should mention there is a short trailer/mini movie with Danny Trejo called Machete, before getting to the main feature. Basically an experimental bio-nerve gas has been released at a remote U.S. military base in Texas, and those exposed (the ""specimans"") who have turned into flesh-eating, mutating zombies have escaped and are out to kill. Various characters, including stripper Cherry (Scream's Rose McGowan) who loses her leg and has it replaced by a really gun, her ex-boyfriend mechanic Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), Block (Josh Brolin), Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn), Dakota (Marley Shelton) and some others join forces to kill all the ""sickos"" before they take over the town, and eventually the world. Also starring Jeff Fahey as J.T., Rebel Rodriguez as Tony, Bruce Willis as Muldoon, Lost's Naveen Andrews as Abby, Julio Oscar Mechoso as Romy, Black Eyed Peas' Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson as Tammy, Insomnia's Nicky Katt as Joe, From Dusk Till Dawn's Tom Savini as Deputy Tolo, Quentin Tarantino as Rapist #1 (with a great gross moment where his penis is melting) and Cheech Marin as Priest. I suppose it didn't have the biggest amount of plot or point, I just think it worth seeing for the amount of gore and exaggerated blood amounts, e.g. when a character is shot. Worth watching!",Planet Terror
7,Tweekums,A deliberately trashy homage to '70s exploitation films,7,31 May 2017,"When a deadly chemical known as DC2 is released at a military based in rural Texas something strange starts happening to those affected by it they appear gangrenous and start attacking other people in a zombie like fashion. Among those caught up in the events are Cherry Darling, a go-go dancer who loses a leg when attacked and her bad-boy friend Wray; the local police; barbecue restaurant owner JT and doctors William and Dakota Block. Before the film is over they will have to fight off lots of the infested as well as a group of soldiers with a dark secret.This film is deliberately over-the-top and trashy; anybody shot virtually explodes and the gore level is turned up to eleven this will either make one dislike the film or find it darkly comical. The characters are pretty cheesy too, but again in a fun way. Rose McGowan is entertaining as our one-legged protagonist, Freddy Rodríguez is pretty good as the cliché bad boy Wray, the rest of the cast are decent enough although it can be hard to judge when they are trying to be slightly rubbish! The story is entertaining and provides lots of gory laughs. The deliberate aging of the film with 'scratches' was a bit mixed; when the scratches were minor it gave a good feel to the film but when it was more extreme, and there was even a 'missing reel' it was rather annoying especially when important details were deliberately omitted. Given the mostly comic tone the attempted rape scene featuring Quentin Tarantino just felt nasty even if his demise was satisfyingly unpleasant. Overall I did enjoy this even if it does try a bit too hard to be trashy at times.",Planet Terror

This exciting film packs tension, chills, thrills, terror, sadism, tongue in check and lots of blood and gore- including stabbing,slicing,stabbing,quartering- courtesy of Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger; they create a truly creepy make-up of horrible zombies cannibals.The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods with hair raising thrills and plenty of scares and eerie murders.The astonishing killings are gruesomely executed and grisly graphic. This movie is better than Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, as contains more action and amusing, both tales form a diptych titled 'Grindhouse'. Various players repeat acting, as Marley Shelton as Dr Dakota, Michael Sacks as McGraw and the Avellan twins as the babysitters, they're nice-in law of Robert Rodriguez and wife, Elizabet Avellan(film's producer). Besides appear Tom Savini, prestigious maker-up of Romero films and Carlos Gallardo, El Mariachi's starring , both playing two deputies.The motion picture is lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein(Dimension films), Rodriguez's usual producers.

9,BA_Harrison,"Not great, but better than Death Proof.",6,6 November 2007,"After a strange gasa biological weapon developed by the militaryis deliberately released into the atmosphere, a group of survivors must do battle with hordes of bloodthirsty zombies, whilst also trying to stop the bad guys responsible for the epidemic.Planet Terror is Robert Rodriguez's half of the faux exploitation double-bill originally released in the States (along with Quentin Tarantion's Death Proof and some 'fake' trailers) as Grindhouse. After the ambitious project tanked at the box office, the movies were split, padded to feature length, and released separately worldwide. Whilst neither film is a particularly good example of either directors' work, at least Planet Terror isn't the major disappointment that QT's dull yakathon proved to be.Rodriguez begins his paean to the mindlessly violent drive-in flicks of yesteryear with a fun trailer for a trashy thriller entitled 'Machete', which, packed with OTT action, looks extremely impressive and certainly whets the appetite for the 'main feature'. Unfortunately, whilst Planet Terror doesn't disappoint with its constant inventiveness and awe-inspiring cinematic eye-candy, it is let down by some rather poor performances and a very weak and disjointed storyline which is merely there to connect the series of random (but admittedly) cool ideas and outrageous characters. Although a lot of low-budget exploitation from the 70s and 80s opted for gratuitous sex and violence instead of a tightly crafted plot, the good ones (and there are plenty out there if you look hard enough) delivered both. I can't help but feel that this fact was overlooked by Rodriguez in his rush to make his crazy ideas a reality.Another gripe I have with Planet Terror is that, although it is now no longer part of the 'Grindhouse' experience, it still keeps its 'distressed' appearance. All of the scratchy film stock FX in the world cannot hide the fact that this is a contemporary movie, packed with state of the art digital trickery, and cutting edge directorial and editing techniques. The effect never really rings true and I wish it had been ditched.What Rodriguez does do right, however, is pack his film with mighty fine women and loads of quality gore. It's hard to completely dismiss a film which features a) RoseMcGowan as a very sexy stripper, b) Marley Shelton as a very sexy nurse, c) Stacy Ferguson as a very sexy person who is only there to become a very sexy victim, and d) outstanding work by make-up wizards Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero, who whip up some truly incredible splatter, including several juicy exploding heads and a great scene in which Tom Savini is ripped apart (the prosthetic work is helped somewhat by CGI, but the results are very impressive).Unfortunately, silly old Robert lets pal Quentin get his big chin in front of the camera (always a mistake), and gives way to nepotism, casting his talentless nieces as a pair of annoying babysitters. He also throws in a couple of characters that stand out as being just plain weird: Naveen Andrews plays a character who inexplicably collects testicles(!); and Jeff Fahey is J.T. Hague, a man who spends the entire movie trying to perfect a barbecue sauce (!!). However, he does redeem himself slightly by including an excellent scene in which a mother gives her young son a gun, in order to protect himself, only to have the dumb kid immediately shoot himself in the head.Planet Terror gets a reasonable 6.5 out of 10 from me, although I'm not convinced by it enough to be willing to round my rating up to 7 for IMDb. So it gets a 6.",Planet Terror
10,moonspinner55,"""Fire up the Killdozer!""",6,7 November 2010,"Replicating not only the look and sound but also--and most importantly--the ambiance of the double-feature specialties of the drive-in movie theaters in the 1970s, filmmakers Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino took a gamble with their bloated co-effort, ""Grindhouse""--the first half a messy splatter flick (""Planet Terror"", which unspools in the manner of George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead) and the second a psycho action-thriller (""Death Proof"", which draws upon a number of inspirations, from ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" to ""Satan's Cheerleaders""). Neither film (augmented with 'worn' reels and sloppy jump cuts, plus actors and characters who appear in both episodes) is particularly good plot-wise; however, both movies are incredible solely as visceral experiences, offering a lot of fun for select audiences. In ""Planet Terror"" (originally entitled ""Project Terror"", which made more sense), mass quantities of a deadly biochemical gas are released into the air, turning citizens into marauding zombies; an unlikely band of survivors fights back, led by a cocky-cool modern-day gunfighter and his stripper-girlfriend, who turns the horrible loss of her right leg to everyone's advantage. There's much to enjoy here visually, yet the plot-mechanics and characters fail to emerge due to Rodriguez's garbled script, which is quite funny intentionally on occasion but is more often than not just plain dumb. **1/2 from ****",Planet Terror
11,Quinoa1984,"""I want to eat your brains... and gain your knowledge.""",9,8 March 2008,"Planet Terror, before becoming it's own movie-animal of sorts as a stand-alone feature released in most parts of the world (and on DVD), was a slightly shorter, near-perfect first part of a double-bill of the Rodriguez/Tarantino double-feature Grindhouse. Not to sound like I'm in a rocking chair rambling like it's old times (and it's not even a year since its North American release), but Grindhouse contained in it two features that just very simply, quickly tapped into that genuine spirit of B-movies out there, the art and power of sleaze and trash that might not be that when done right. And also as a treat, each film showcases, in all fetishized and stupendous glory, the skills of the respective filmmakers (this goes as well for the directors of the 'trailers' that ran between the two films). For Tarantino it's stylized long-shots, intellectual-cum-vapid dialog, and a penchant for bad-ass ladies and some sick violence.For Rodriguez, it's what we've come to see as a sort of mix between his Mariachi films and From Dusk till Dawn: slam-bang action, truly absurd twists with the occasional shock factor (in this case the ""accidental"" death of a child), and raucous humor from dialog that, in its own right, is probably just as self-consciously clever as QT's. On its own, and in its extended and unrated cut form, as recently watched on DVD, Planet Terror luckily doesn't suffer as much from the added footage as Death Proof nearly did. There isn't some big block of specific scenes stuffed back in from the original cut, however the bits that are noticeable for those who are aware of the original 90 minute version- i.e. waking up at night to see the green-tinted moon, the extra bit at the police station, some extras at the hospital- don't really add much at all to the proceedings to make it any better as it is.For what it's worth though, to those who will seek it out having not had the luck- as imposed by the what seems to be ironic monacher after the Machete trailer ""Brought to you by your friends at the Weinstein Company!""- Planet Terror is a kick-ass, take-no-prisoners zombie flick, filled with enough ballsy attitude for two B-movies that deserve to get immediately dusted off and played to packed audiences of sick f***s who cant get enough of gruesome, over-the-top horror violence and tongue-in--so-deep-it's-breaking-the-cheek dialog. A simple premise is that a noxious gas is let loose by a military group, somehow in some deranged plot involved with a post Bin-Laden atmosphere, and it creates total havoc on a small Texas town over one night. And over this one night a go-go dancer, a crafty but vulnerable nurse, a Chicano who's ""got the devil in im'"", a BBQ maestro, and some various tag-alongs and police officers bind together to fight the combat the infectious plague.Made with panache and visual as well as verbal wit (maybe funniest is how a sex scene is so hot it burns up the screen, literally, and when the scene comes back on the place is on fire!), Rodriguez has a nifty little classic of a comedy almost in the guise of an action film inspired by both Fulci and Carpenter (however much better than the former would ever produce). Watch it friends!",Planet Terror
12,BandSAboutMovies,A big budget Nightmare City,7,24 July 2019,"The idea for Planet Terror came up while Robert Rodriguez was making The Faculty. He told them young actors that zombie movies were ready to rise from its grave and he wanted to get there first. He was more than correct and he missed his chance to be the first of many modern zombie films.When Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea for Grindhouse, his zombie film idea came back to him. The name of the film pays homage to the late night horror movie show that aired in the director's hometown of San Antonio on KENS-TV during the 1970s and early 1980s.Many of the cast members had previously worked with Rodriguez, with Marley Shelton and Bruce Willis appearing in Sin City, Savini in From Dusk Till Dawn and Michael Parks reprising his role of Earl McGraw from that film (he also plays the same role in Death Proof). However, Harvey Weinstein didn't want Rose McGowan to be cast in the film. That's because she had raised alleged sexual assault allegations against him and as a result, was blacklisted from any Miramax movie. Rodriguez was her at the time and specifically cast her knowing that it would enrage Harvey while his brother Bob would still release the film, as he controlled the Dimension releases.McGowan would accuse Rodriguez of exploiting her, but the director supporter her statements against Weinstein. He said that she signed on to the script and whenever she's threatened by men, she always ends up taking them out.McGowan plays Cherry Darling, an exotic dancer who leaves behind her job and runs back into her ex, El Ray (Freddy Rodriguez) in the midst of a growing zombie invasion that leads them to the Bone Shack. There, the last remnants of humanity - J.T. Hague (Jeff Fahey), his brother Sherrif Hague (Michael Biehn) and his deputies (Tom Savini and Carlos Gallardo) - are battling the living dead.This is all happens because Lt. Muldoon (Willis) and his men - who killed Osama Bin laden - are making a transaction with chemical engineer Abby (Naveen Andrews) for mass quantities of the gas that keeps them alive, which is called Project Terror. The gas gets released, soon mutating everyone.There's also a very Halloween 2 hospital, which is presided over by Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his soon-to-be estranged wife Dakota (Shelton), who is trying to get their son (Rodriguez's son Rebel) and her lover Tammy (Fergie) out of town. That's where Cherry ends up after an accident and zombie attack, losing her leg and gaining a gun for an appendage.Dakota ends up being the daughter of Texas Ranger Earl McGraw, but her son Tony shoots himself in the face when she gives him a gun (Rodriguez made a happy ending, the one he has shown to his son, which plays after the credits). As Cherry and El Wray start to rekindle their relationship, the reel for the film is missing - just like a real grindhouse movie - and when we come back, the zombies have attached the Bone Shack and the rest of the film basically turns into a John Carpenter movie, stacking the deck against the heroes with near impossible odds. Rodriguez used the soundtracks to Escape From New York and The Thing to get the actors in the mood on set. The director wanted Carpenter to write the music for this movie, but that never happened.Planet Terror succeeds where Death Proof fails in that it's a non-stop action ride that's short on brains and long on fun. I love that Bruce Willis is never in the same frame as any of the other actors, as if this were an Italian horror film and his scenes were added on to get international distribution thanks to his name value.It's pretty much the big budget remake of Nightmare City, except there are no scenes where zombies attack a bunch of ladies while they Jazzercise. There are also references and homages to Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Cry of the Banshee, Killdozer, From Beyond and Fulci's Zombie. It is in no way as good as those films, while fun in its own right. Hopefully, it introduced some audience to the undistilled bursts of insanity that it attempted to recreate.",Planet Terror
13,Coventry,"The Gooey, Gory Texas Barbecue Sauce Massacre.",9,28 October 2007,"It was fairly clear since ""Desperado"" (1995) already, but now it's irreversibly official: Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are geniuses when they work separately and, when they're working together, they're just freaking brilliant! The whole ""Grindhouse"" concept was the greatest treat fans of 70's horror & exploitation cinema could ever hope for, and even though the segments were released with an approximated difference of four months here in Europe, the films belong amongst the biggest genre highlights of the new Millennium so far. Rodriguez' ""Planet Terror"" is even more entertaining and  especially  more 'grindhouse' than Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". Like the tagline promises, this movie is fully loaded with excessive violence, extreme gore & sleaze, demented characters, crazed humor & dialogs, politically incorrect twists, deliberately atrocious acting performances, missing film reels, awesome gimmicks and  most of all  a truly delicious preview of upcoming attractions. ""Death Proof"" was a cool flick, but ""Planet Terror"" represents the true grindhouse spirit, as it rudimentary is a horribly bad film but with an unsurpassed entertainment value. The script is indescribably incoherent, grotesque and silly and it obviously doesn't care about the massive amount of plot holes and improbabilities. Whenever the situations completely stop to make sense, the film simply swifts to another scene or pretends there's some footage missing and the problem is solved. It must be so much fun making a movie and knowing beforehand you don't have to worry too much about continuity, quality or a proper finishing. An isolated Texan community is soon overrun with ravenous and bloodthirsty zombies, victims of a powerful secret gas weapon that got released from a nearby military base camp. The rapidly decreasing number of survivors gather together and attempt to flee, but they end up prisoners in the military camp. Among the survivors are the hyper cool Mexican bad-boy El Wray, his ex girlfriend turned go-go dancer Cherry, a couple of brave Texas Rangers (familiar ones!), a tough female doctor, a pair of crazed babysitters, a weirdo scientist and the best damn barbecue sauce making cook in the whole of Texas! They discover that the army guys are actually immune to the gas themselves and they allowed it to escape for a horrible reason. ""Planet Terror"" is an OTT hilarious and fast-pace rush of adrenalin every horror fanatic will love to sink his/her teeth in. The gore & smut factor of this film is nearly indescribably! Every gunshot ensues into a massive bloodbath, there are exploding heads and gooey decapitations, machine gun limbs, perverted rapes and uncompromising child deaths. There were ""Death Proof"" was more like a tribute to films of that period, ""Planet Terror"" genuinely feels like a rancid product of the lurid 70's! Rodriguez' colleague and buddy Quentin Tarantino appears in a delightfully insane role as a maniacal and gas-sniffing rapist, respected actors (like Bruce Willis and Michael Biehn) professionally give away lousy performances and even make-up effects wizard Tom Savini joins the party as a nervous deputy. The soundtrack is thrilling and the thoroughly cheap atmosphere takes you right back to a dark & sticky-floored 70's movie-theater. ""Planet Terror"" is 100% pure and guaranteed fun.",Planet Terror
14,hitchcockthelegend,I'm gonna eat your brains and gain your knowledge.,7,7 October 2010,"Planet Terror is written & directed by Robert Rodriguez. It stars Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey & Bruce Willis.After an experimental bio-weapon explodes it unleashes thousands of flesh eating zombies upon the public.

Both QT's Death Proof and RR's Planet Terror exist now as standalone movies, to judge them as such is really not that hard to do. Planet Terror is a riot, just over 100 minutes of gloopy, gory fun made as a homage to horror's cheap and nasty heyday. Accept that and it's hard to imagine most genre fans not having a good time with it. Some of it's uneven (it peaks too early and runs a touch out of steam), and not all the ""star"" castings work, while it's certainly lacking the more cranial leanings of Death Proof.

15,Theo Robertson,A Bit Too Silly To Be A Post Modernist Classic,6,13 June 2013,"According to word of mouth the double feature of GRINDHOUSE flopped in the United States because people walked out of the cinema not realising the concept of a double feature . Even if there is some truth in this surely if people have paid their money to watch a film it won't affect the box office as to when an audience walk out on the film ? One thinks there's an apocryphal myth at play here similar to the French audience who ran out screaming from a late 19th Paris cinema as soon as an on screen train came puffing head on towards them . Perhaps the low box office return for the GRINDHOUSE double bill was much lower than expected was that the two films were too expensively stylised to make an expected profit ? Why go to so much expense to make a couple of B movies on an A list budget when so many hacks in the 1970s were able to do it on a Z list budget ? That said PLANET TERROR is a highly stylised film , perhaps too much so . To all intents and purposes it's very similar to those brainless films you'd get in the video store circa 1982 that you'd endlessly discuss with your schoolmates who'd no doubt think it was a great film due to the gore . Certainly PT is a gory film , inspired by the works of David Cronenberg and George A Romero but perhaps lacking in the cerebral social commentary both of those directors brought to their films . Here producer Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez bring post modernist visuals to the movie . Unfortunately they both try a bit too hard and the visuals become something of a gimmick . For example why shoot and photograph a film that looks like late 1970s exploitation B movie when characters are seen using mobile phones that wouldn't have existed in that time period ? The more the film tries to look like exploitation 70s cinema the more distracting it becomes in its failure to convince Another aspect that fails to work is its somewhat silly tone . A character gets their leg amputated and is replaced by firstly a table leg then later a gun . No complaints that it's rather tasteless because it is amusing to a degree but this plot point becomes more and more over used and silly the more the film continues . If I remember correctly this tongue in cheek humour also spoiled Rodriguez DESPERADO to a degree in its ambition to be a cult classic . Humour is a subjective thing and what may be amusing to a director doesn't necessarily get translated to an audience . It's not the director's fault but real life events in America in the last few months involving killing sprees with firearms makes much of the comic book violence in PT seem blatantly pornographic in hindsightIn summary this is a mildly diverting film that suffers from trying too hard to emulate the films it parodies . It's entertaining enough while you're watching it but it's not really a film you're going to be a hurry to rewatch either and you'll probably have forgotten all about it the next day",Planet Terror

17,poolandrews,Cool zombie gore horror film.,7,4 July 2009,"Planet Terror is set in Texas where Cherry Darling (rose McGowan) works as a Go-Go Dancer but decides to quit & ends up at 'The Bone Shack' diner where she runs into her old boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), while driving back into town they are attacked by flesh eating zombies & Cherry's leg is ripped-off. At the local hospital Cherry is treated while the staff there notice how busy it's getting with lots of admissions with people suffering from bites & some sort of disease that rots the flesh. Soon the patients start turning into flesh eating zombies the hospital becomes overrun, Wray finds & rescues Cherry while the local Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) & his men have their work cut out trying to control the zombie outbreak. Low on ammo & heavily outnumbered by the zombies a small group of human survivors must fight to save their lives as the zombie virus spreads...Photographed, co-edited, written, produced, directed & scored by Robert Rodriguez Planet Terror was originally one half of the film Grindhouse (2007) in which he teamed up with director Quentin Tarantino to try & recreate the grind-house experience of the 70's where flea-pit cinemas would run double bills of sleazy & cheap exploitation, sex & horror films. Tarantino made Deathproof (2007) which was the first half & Rodriguez made this which was the second film & there were also various fake trailers at the start & between just to add to the authenticity, alas the three plus hour Grindhouse flopped at the box-office with many audience members apparently walking out after Tarantino's Deathproof not realising there was another entire film still to come & both films were subsequently split up as separate features & released on home video as stand alone films. From a personal point of view I think Planet Terror is a much better & much more entertaining film than Deathproof although both films are really rather good. Planet Terror apparently had the working title Project Terror & to me felt a big budget Night of the Living Dead (1968) homage for the most part with some group of human survivors trying to fend off an ever growing number of flesh eating zombies but Rodriguez manages to put enough distinctive touches & neat ideas of his own into Planet Terror to make it much more than just the rip-off it could have been. There are some truly great moments that mix horror, comedy, over-the-top splatter & gore & there's even some nice character driven moments that give the film just that little bit of extra meaning. Planet Terror has pretty everything you could want from good looking girls to huge guns to even huger explosions, lots of blood & gore, lots of action & a really energetic feel about it. There are some great scenes including the funny one where Cherry has her severed leg replaced with a table leg & wobbles all over the place as she tries to walk on it for the first time or the way Sheriff Hague mows down loads of zombies in a big truck while there are lots of action scenes too with shoot-outs, explosions & fights. Rodriguez fills the film with various gags, references & homages to other films (including Tarantino's Deathproof) & I am sure most will spot at least a few, the film has a great pace & is never dull or boring & is just good ultra cool zombie horror action entertainment form start to finish with enough distinct touches to turn this from a good film into a great one. So why haven't I given Planet Terror more than seven stars out of ten? Well, basically once the film reaches it's climax at the military base I though it lost a little something & I hated the idea of a 'Missing Reel' which leaves a huge & for me an incredibly frustrating jump in logic & narrative which felt very jarring & I really don't see why the makers felt it necessary.To try & recreate the true grind-house feel the film has been deliberately scratched with prominent lines, there is lots of speckle, splice cuts & sound pops & jumps too which I found a bit off putting & was maybe one gimmick too far although at least the special edition Blu-ray features a 'Newly Discovered Scratch Free Version' as an extra bonus. There's lots of gore here from exploding heads to ripped out guts to severed limbs to melting men to cut off testicles. The CGI computer effects are kept to explosions & the like & are very good. The film has lots of cool individual moments & Rodriguez likes his actors to pose in cool stances like Cherry looking on wearing sunglasses after she has just killed someone or El Wray's slick moves with his guns & knives. Before Planet terror starts there's a fake trailer for a terrible looking film called Machete which I wouldn't go to see if it even existed on the basis of this trailer.Not a big success at the box-office Planet Terror probably deserved better & it a cool looking film with good special effects & a really cool style. The acting is pretty good, Rose McGowan & Marley Shelton both look hot while there are nice performances from Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin & Michael Biehn while Quentin Tarantino, Bruce Willis & Tom Savini all have memorable cameos.Planet Terror is a very enjoyable blood soaked gore horror action film with enough quirks & coolness to make a memorable viewing experience but that missing reel really annoys & frustrates me & it's like have a huge chunk of it missing because basically it does.",Planet Terror
18,lastliberal,Rose is so much better the second time around.,8,2 March 2008,"Sure, I was one of the fanboys who wouldn't miss the latest Robert Rodriguez classic when it came out in the theater, but seeing it for the second time was even better. I just can't get enough of Rose McGowan, and being up close and personal with her was a real thrill.This is, without a doubt, one of the best zombie movies ever made. Only one other I can think of gives it any real competition. The Machete trailer makes it even better - and makes me wish that would come out soon.This film was almost non-stop action from start to finish. Blood by the buckets, and heads exploding everywhere. It had enough to satisfy any zombie lover.Besides McGowan, there was also Freddy Rodríguez from ""Six Feet Under"", Marley Shelton, certifiably on of the sexiest women in the world, Fergie, Naveen Andrews, and The Man - Bruce Willis.A rocking good time!",Planet Terror

I have always been more of a Tarantino fan than Robert Rodriguez, but thought ""Sin City"" was brilliant and expected at least something entertaining for ""Planet Terror"". No, it is incredibly lame. Plot is full of holes, action sequences are incredibly contrived, acting is wooden.I realise that this was a homage to the Z-grade cheap horror Grindhouse movies of the 70s, but Rodriguez didn't have to be so faithful to the genre and make a crap movie.",Planet Terror
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Being good at being bad never looked so great,8,26 January 2019,"Rural Texas. A weapons deal gone bad leads to massive amounts of gas being released into the air which mutates people into hideous zombies. A small group of survivors try to escape: The former go-go dancer Cherry Darling(McGowan, born for this), her mysterious ex El Wray(Rodriguez, badass), brothers and owners of the soon to be award-winning barbecue place J.T.(Fahey, who'll never give up his recipe) and Sheriff Hague(Michael Biehn, cool as always), etc.This is a tribute to exploitation films. It's bigger, faster, and much more well produced than those, and subverts the tropes of the subgenre. Every single role is perfectly cast, including the ones where it's non-actors portraying roles. All the characters are memorable, and I love how every single one of them is in some way related to at least one other of them. It manages to somehow balance both postponing something we want from it, with us enjoying that delay. It's rare to see so many subplots interact with each other so naturally. This is a spiritual successor to From Dusk Till Dawn: over the top gore, gross, with tons of undead dying, and killing, on screen.I recommend this to anyone who likes the work of its writer-director, and/or who finds the trailers for it even remotely appealing. 8/10",Planet Terror

It was definitely gory and morbid, but it offered some humor as well. I mean... who collects testicles???? Gross.... yet somewhat humorous the way he obsessed over his collection.The movie was fast paced, everything happened over the course of one night. I was a bit lost though. It was a mystery how it all started, what the army's involvement was, what were some of the relationships in the movie, etc. The movie seemed to focus on the action and the gore more than anything.

Fortunately, there are a few people in the local area who are resistant to the deadly vapor but in order to survive they will still have to contend with an ever-growing zombie epidemic. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is one of those films that viewers will probably either love or hate. That said those who view this film as a work of genius will no doubt love this movie. Others, like myself, will see it as an enormous waste of talent in which the director (Robert Rodriguez) opted for cheap gimmicks and pyrotechnics in order to make an artistic statement. Personally, I didn't think the movie was that bad but I certainly feel it could have been much, much better. Accordingly I rate it as average.",Planet Terror
23,anaconda-40658,Deathproof is Superior.,5,2 June 2015,"Grindhouse: Planet Terror (2007): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Jeff Fahey: First of stylized double drive-in style feature regards a deadly gas that turns humanity into zombies. Robert Rodriguez is creative but the plot eventually becomes one graphic scene of violence after another. Rose McGowan delivers a great performance as a go-go dancer whose leg is devoured by zombies and replaced with a machine gun. The methods in which this weapon is used are a low point in over the top violence. Freddy Rodriguez plays her fugitive ex-boyfriend who takes several risks and uses his street smarts to ward off zombies. Josh Brolin plays a cynical doctor who abuses his bi-sexual wife when he learns that she has been involved with another woman. Marley Shelton plays his wife whose hands become lifeless at a pivotal moment. She must survive using other methods that do not regard the use of her hands. Jeff Fahey plays head chef at a fancy little place called The Bone Shack, which is the perfect title for an eatery in a film like this. Between the two Grindhouse films I prefer the Quentin Tarantino version Deathproof, which is broader and more amusing. Both film suit the drive-in market but from two very different sub-genres. With all the graphic violence this film nearly becomes a different type of terror. Score: 5 / 10",Planet Terror
24,Aaron1375,A really fun zombie movie with lots of gore...no I mean lots of GORE!!!,9,23 October 2007,"This movie was just great, one of the better zombie spoofs out there, and yes it is more a spoof than a serious movie. I laughed quite a few times at this one. Story, what story who cares? Well there sort of is one. Seems a chemical has been released and it is of course causing people to be zombies. We have a rather good cast of characters which includes a very fine looking Rose McGowan. The zombie outbreak takes a bit to get going, but when it finally does there is buckets of blood as it just spews out everywhere to a very insane extent. We have our hero who is great with guns, I mean they prove it by him spinning them around. Well actually it did not look all that impressive, but the characters in the movie were just looking at him in awe. Then there is the mother of a child whose doctor husband is a tad crazy. She loves her child, but I question her one decision. Then there is the great revelation of our hero, to bad the reel was missing at that point. And anyone who thinks what occurred during the missing reel scene was actually shot, has no sense of humor. So we have some Texas barbecue, some zombies, and a hot chick with a gun leg doing stripper moves (pardon me go go dancer moves) while she blasts away the zombies. Yes, this movie had it all. Though surprisingly it had a couple of slow bits to, not that it deters from the movie a lot, but they were noticeable.",Planet Terror
25,Wuchakk,Black comedy/thriller/horror about biochemically-birthed zombie outbreak in central Texas,5,15 October 2018,"Created by writer/director Robert Rodriguez, ""Planet Terror"" was originally part of the double feature called ""Grindhouse,"" released in 2007. The other movie was ""Death Proof"" by Quentin Tarantino. Both were standalone stories, although vaguely connected. They were a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in this flick, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like ""Machete,"" were also part of the package.The plot of ""Planet Terror"" involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight 'em, led by Freddy Rodríguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone's guess).The movie comes across as a melding of ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" (1965), ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), but with the modern tone of ""Slither"" (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind o' touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie.At the end of the day, though, ""Planet Terror"" fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like ""Flu Bird Horror"" (2008), ""Wyvern"" (2009) and ""Sasquatch Mountain"" (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. Go figure.The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes and was shot in central Texas (Austin and Luling, which is 22 miles south of Austin) and Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico.GRADE: C",Planet Terror
26,The_Void,Fun and gory - like it should be!,8,27 December 2007,"I was disappointed when I found out that Grindhouse was being split into two for the UK release; and even more disappointed when I found out that the more highly praised half of the duo, Planet Terror, wasn't coming to a cinema near me. So while I didn't get to see this on the big screen; on the small screen, Rodriguez's latest is still a great gory thrill ride that is sure not to disappoint anyone who is a fan of this sort of film. Planet Terror is obviously going to be compared with the other half of Grindhouse; Tarantino's Death Proof, and of the two of them; this is definitely the better film...although I do have to say that Tarantino's effort captured the gritty seventies Grindhouse style better. The plot is basically your typical excuse for a gory zombie bloodbath. We open with a disagreement between a doctor and a disgruntled army man, which results in a deadly bio-weapon being unleashed in a town in Texas. As more and more people fall to the virus, it is left to the few survivors to band together and do something about the outbreak...The film is not short on either violence or action as director Robert Rodriguez doesn't exactly hold back on the gunfire or the squibs, and several high octane stunt sequences ensure that the movie moves quickly and it's always entertaining. However, this for me is what distances the film from the seventies Grindhouse flicks that it is an ode to; the effects are a little bit too sophisticated for this sort of film for my liking. However, that really isn't too important; the film is clearly meant to be a good time, and that's exactly what it is. Planet Terror features some great ideas; the most memorable of which is the stripper with a gun for a leg! Despite being incredibly ridiculous, this idea actually works quite well and Rose McGowan is excellent in the role. As he did for Sin City, Rodriguez has rounded up a decent bunch of stars to flesh out his film, including Josh Brolin, Michael Biehn, Freddy Rodriguez and Bruce Willis. Like Death Proof, this film has several 'glitches' (including an annoying 'missing reel' section) only here they don't bode as well. Still, despite my problem with it; Planet Terror is a very fun little flick and I certainly won't hesitate to recommend it!",Planet Terror
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Planet Terror,10,23 September 2007,"I am a fan of Tarantino, though I'm slighty disappointed with his portion in the Tarantino- Rodriguez Grindhouse partnership. It's classic Tarantino with the excellent dialogue, but Death Proof seemed to be lacking something, and seemed more like a Tarantino movie done Blaxploitation style. Now Rodriguez's offering with Planet Terror is the bomb, and it is miles better than Death Proof in containing the spirit of Grindhouse, and that it doesn't seem to have his fingerprints and stylistic references all over it, making it a truly wicked grindhouse experience.The opening pole dance by Rose McGowan as Cherry Darling is worth the admission ticket, set to a pulsating score contributed by Rodriguez himself, which rocked the entire picture with its snazzy, catchy tune which doesn't seem the least embarrassing. It's worth more than the lap dance sequence in Death Proof, which seemed rather tame as compared to the energy exuded by McGowaan. But sexiness is not just her character's trait, as she does get to kick some serious butt with that machine gun to save humanity, and does so with aplomb, that I will rate her Cherry Darling as one of the most interesting female action heroes out there.And true to the spirit of Grindhouse, there are tons, and I mean really tons of blazing guns that don't seem to run out of bullets, blood that splatter, spray, and ooze, plenty of gore and many more gut spilling. Action sequences are filled with exaggeration and stylized violence, you can't help but to chuckle at them, yet cheer them on. To me, it seemed that all the cast and crew had a wonderful time trying to recreate those cheesy moments, especially with the spouting of extremely cringeworthy lines of dialogue, and even more terrible acting, but this attitude of fun permeates through the movie, even having an essential reel (with I'm sure plenty more flesh you would want to see, and probably some major plot revelations as well) gone missing. Ha!The story played out like a no brainer, with plenty of characters thrown in for the fun of it, and scenes which jump from one to another without much proper coherence. But who cares, since all we want to see are flesh and blood. So the semblance of a story goes with an experimental biological weapon released airborne into a town, and everyone starts turning into zombies one by one. It's Invasion and a gang of survivors, ala 28 Days/Weeks Later, got to put aside their differences, gang together and hold out for survival, which involved a scene which looked straight out of Feast.Freddy Rodriguez leads the group as highly skilled with a mysterious past El Wray, who has the hots for Cherry Darling, his ex. They're joined by Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton), Sheriff Hague and Deputy Carlos - Michael Biehn from Terminator and Crlos Gallardo from El Mariachi - experienced folks with guns and survival of course, and a hot of other recognizable faces like Stacy Ferguson, Naveen Andrews, and even Quentin Tarantino as well, in a role that is reminiscent of his character in From Dusk Till Dawn (at least that mouth of his anyway) and in a scene that will bound to make his detractors laugh out loud. Look out too for a cameo appearance (and this guy seem to be making a lot of uncredited/cameo appearances too) and his dialogue regarding the war on terror.I'd highly recommend Planet Terror over Death Proof anytime (sorry Tarantino), and it is too bad their idea of kickstarting a slew of Grindhouse features seemed to have taken a backseat due to the lacklustre performance of their double bill. But this one, I'd go as far as to say it's under contention for my top 10 movies of the year. Go watch, and don' forget the coda (extremely short though) at the end of the credits.P.S. the movie version shown in Singapore is the extended version, and came together with the ""Prevue"" of Machete, one of the fake trailer segment out of four which made it here.",Planet Terror

Among the wounded is go-go dancer Cherry who hooks up with her old boyfriend Wray,the badass of the town who knows martial arts.Unfortunately, Cherry gets her leg amputated,so Wray hooks up a machine gun to her stump.The bloodbath ensues...""Planet Terror"" is a much better episode than ""Death Proof"".It contains guns,zombies and plenty of gore and violence.The action is fast,the grue flows freely and the script is hugely entertaining.Tellingly though it's the little touches which prove more rewarding than the whole and a fake trailer for imaginary movie ""Machete"" starring Danny Trejo that precedes the actual film is ironically the most enjoyable part of the package.8 out of 10.",Planet Terror
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,It started off so good and then the genre completely changed,6,3 November 2007,"I think this has been the ultimate roller coaster ride, after my boyfriend begged for me to rent Death Proof, which I thought I would hate and he thought he would love, it was the complete opposite, I loved that movie and he hated it. So I was really excited to see Planet Terror, which he didn't wanna see, because he figured if he didn't like Death Proof, why would he like this one? But I was curious because I heard Planet Terror was better, well he loved it, I just thought it was alright. But we both agreed on one thing, boy did this movie take one gigantic turn. It went from this awesome old-school type of zombie flick to a government action movie and not to mention had the most unbelievable situations. Now don't get me wrong, there are some things that I will always let slide, but Rose McGowan's character was complete B.S., with her leg, just she learns how to walk with a table leg in the same night that she lost her real leg? I don't wanna nit pick because at times it was cool, but the story just completely fell apart in the second act.It starts off as a normal night for some, that is until people on the road are being led to a Military Base camp where there is a deadly virus that is turning the people into brain eating zombies. The virus quickly takes over and people are killing each other all over town. But a group of people are going to do their best to survive the night and beat these killer zombies, if it's the last thing that they do.While I absolutely loved the beginning, I mean, it had great gore, a fun script, and some hilarious dark comedy, I just loved the Sargent character played by Michael Biehn(who I was so happy to see after so many years) when he tells the group of people ""Shoot as many as you can... but don't shoot me!"" and then ""missing reel"" ""I can't believe my own deputy shot me!"", I couldn't stop laughing. Like I said, I thought the first hour was just great, but the ending just took a complete turn from what I thought this film was going to be. But I would still say to give it a look, you will get a few scares and a few good laughs at least. But I'll just stick to Death Proof.6/10",Planet Terror

But then a freak accident makes her lose her leg...and the fun starts here. A chemical virus is unleashed and before anyone knows anything maroons of flesh-eating zombies are roaming loose, terrorizing anything in their path. Cherry and her boyfriend must team up with some other fighters to take care of them.The second part of this odd double bill has finally arrived, to a rather un-noticed audience in the UK, as it was released out of nowhere. It even has a trailer before it for 'Machete', an action hero born out Rodriguez's desire for his own Mexican action hero, played by Danny Trejo, which would have made an okay film of it's own.Onto this film itself, it's colourful and gory, with plenty of appropriately blood-gauging zombies roaming around. It's a zombie film right down to the tee, unfortunately it's come without much in the way of a decent plot and great acting. That may have been the point but...I'd watch it a million times over Death Proof and there's a lively supporting cast including Josh Brolin, Jeff Fahey, Michael Biehn, Bruce Willis and Naveen Andrews, but personally I'm glad this is the last of this rather self indulgent venture from two of cinema's more subversive directors. **",Planet Terror
34,bowmanblue,A girl with a gun for a leg. Nuff said,8,20 June 2014,"All you need to know about 'Planet Terror' is that, due to events I won't go into in great detail, a former stripper gets her leg replaced by a machine gun. Once 'attached' she can then fire it with pinpoint accuracy (let's not go into exactly HOW she can fire a gun with a trigger at 'knee height') and even shoot missiles into the floor which propel her through the air, allowing her to leap over walls.If that concept sounds like the biggest load of tosh you've ever heard, then you're probably better off not bothering with this one. However, if you think that sounds like the craziest and/or coolest thing you've ever heard of, then give Planet Terror a try.If you sit through it you'll find a zombie film that's actually got quite a big budget, only it's concealed within a movie that prides itself on looking cheap and B-movie-like. There's a whole host of famous actors in it (many famous for their B-movie roles), more gore than you could ever wish for and did I mention there's a stripper with a machine gun for a leg?

This retro-fifties horror film captures both the feel and the oddities of the old-time western, horror films and exaggerates and parodies many of the unique, fascinating features of the blood and gore. At the time, Richard Rodriguez has added a classy and crazy sense of both humor and more sublime emotional drama making this movie a well-rounded gory but truly amazing cinematic experience. This are some pretty weird, but not putrid scenes. There is plenty of Kill Bill slaughter and blood but even so it's strangely done in a way that's calmly pretend killing. Overall, this is a unique and well-thought out movie with Rose McGowen well-suited for her role, with a nice hard emotional scenes. Eight out of Ten Stars.",Planet Terror
37,kenjha,Trashy Tribute,1,3 July 2008,"This is supposed to be either a tribute or a spoof of grindhouse films of yesteryear. Since there is hardly any humor in it, it must be a tribute. What is the point of paying tribute to bad, low-budget movies by making one that is as bad and as cheap-looking as any in the genre? The plot is a rehash of films like ""Dawn of the Dead,"" where zombies are walking around eating people. This one does nothing to reinvent the genre. The film is just an excuse to film a lot of disgusting, gory violence, which is not entertainment. The only positive is that there are some hot-looking women, including McGowan, who looks fine whether sporting one leg or two.",Planet Terror
38,The-Sarkologist,The machine gun leg is cool,6,19 October 2013,"This is the second film in the Grindhouse double feature. When I first heard of them I wanted to see them and now that I have I can appreciate what he whole scene was about. While I am unlikely to go and look for schlock slasher and zombie flicks from the past, I do feel that both Tarantino and Rodreguez have brought the past too life with this films.Planet Terror is the lesser of the two films simply because Rodreguez does not put as much into character development as Tarantino does. Rodreguez is simply an action director who is not afraid of blood and gore (though his films do not go to the extent that they are considered pornographic). One of the reasons I don't like R-rated movies is because you simply do not know what you are going to see on the screen. As R-rating is at the top of the chain, basically it sounds as if anything is possible. However that is not quite true simply because we have a tight rating system in Australia, and anything beyond R is either considered pornographic, or simply banned.Planet Terror is set in a small town (in fact the same town as Death Proof and occurs on the same night as the events in Death Proof as we have the same doctors, the same Sheriff, and at one stage, the girls' corpses are brought into the hospital). However this film is about zombies, and if one likes zombies, one gets lots of them. The story is that Bin Laden was killed but when he was killed some gas was released poisoning the entire unit. The unit managed to do enough to prevent themselves from becoming zombies, but this required slow release of the gas into their system. As such they required more gas, so arranged for a bio-chemist to get some for them. The only problem is they don't want to pay for it, so the bio-chemist shoots the cannisters releasing it into the atmosphere.This is where the fun starts as people begin coming into the hospital complaining of scabs and sores, and quite quickly then begin to mutate into zombies. However a number of people are immune to the gas, so they manage to get themselves to a dinner where they attempt to make one last stand. I won't say anymore than this because this is a film that, while it has a story, it is only the background for zombies and blood and gore, and there is an awful lot of it. Oh, while it may not appear to be the case at the beginning, the one legged girl does end up with a machine gun instead of a leg. I guess that is the lunacy of exploitation.",Planet Terror
39,poe426,Contemporary kitsch...,5,25 November 2007,"Ah, the memories this one brings back; the drive-in on a warm summer's night, for one: and every night, midway through the first feature, a train would pass by, blowing its whistle to clear the track of kids sitting outside the chain-link fence watching the movie(s) ""for free."" It's a ritual I sorely miss, going to that drive-in. (Several years ago, I posted a script on the American Zoetrope site- DOUBLE FEATURE- that attempted to recapture that feeling. One-third of said script can be found in THE NIGHT RIDERS by M. Kelley, an xlibris book that we self-published earlier this year.) There were other movie-going experiences over the years that I treasure (see my comments on this site concerning MARK OF THE DEVIL, a film that was rated ""V for Violence""), and some that I did not: just after THE Chinese CONNECTION had made its U.S. debut and was playing the second-run circuit, one enterprising wannabe manager rented out an abandoned theater in a rundown part of town just to show it over one (hopefully profitable) weekend. There were, unbeknownst to him, several reels missing from his print. The fight scenes. Every one of them. The screen would go black, and we could hear the dubbed voices and bone-crunching blows and screams of pain and terror... but we SAW nothing. PLANET TERROR certainly brings back the memories (which is its obvious intention), and the bodily fluids do flow, but, like a lot of the movies to which it pays homage, it leaves you wanting just a tad more.",Planet Terror
40,TheMovieDiorama,Planet Terror failed to terrorise with its blood-bubble bursting infestation.,5,13 January 2020,"The first feature of Rodriguez/Tarantino's homage to the ""Grindhouse"" exploitation genre, is one that exercises the practical magic of independently produced B-movies. No dramatic theatricality to be seen here, on the misty darkened roads of rural Texas where ""Fergalicious"" Fergie screams the countryside down whilst being devoured by infected military units. This is Planet Terror, baby. The only quality that matters is the amount of bloodshed that splatters onto the screen. Rodriguez may have directed, produced, written, scored, edited and shot the entire feature, he seemingly tried too hard in replicating the exploitation aesthetic that, if you strip away the grainy filter, comes across as a mildly engaging experiment. A one-legged Go-Go dancer, her legendary ex-boyfriend, and a plethora of other survivors, make battle with a zombie horde that have been infected with a biochemical agent known as ""Project Terror"".I saw it in the poster. You've seen it in the poster. We've all seen it in the poster. McGowan, with the stance of a badass, equipped with an assault rifle as a leg. That's the level of awesome stupidity we are dealing with here, and to say I craved it would be an understatement. Rodriguez had the freedom to construct a feature so devilishly fun, that it could've been absolutely non-sensical and still be thoroughly entertaining. This is the genre where all rules are broken. Literally! Yet I found myself restrained to the confinement of my sofa. Why? Well, Planet Terror barbecued itself by never letting go. Something was constantly weighing down the feature, and I just can't put my finger on it. The acting smelt of mild cheddar as opposed to stinking bishop. Aside from a few quotable lines, mostly from El Wray, Rodriguez' screenplay was forgettable and largely an unfocused mess. For example, the sub-plot involving Brolin's stern doctor character failed to inject any characterised purpose other than to pad out the runtime. But as soon as McGowan acquired that machine gun, catapulted herself into the air (beautifully terrible green screen and all...) and decimated the zombie horde ahead. Bam! That's when Planet Terror worked! Piloting a helicopter at a slant so that the propeller decapitates the infected? Yes! Tarantino attempting to be a rapist? God no! Turn it off! It was unfortunately too late before it manifested the pure qualities of its genre.Aesthetically though, Rodriguez was able to imitate that exploitation feel. The mass amount of blood spewing from the practical makeup design was exceptional and eloquently highlighted the visceral power of pragmatic effects. Limbs torn off like a family tucking into a KFC bargain bucket. Delicious. The grainy filter that imitated a film reel, ""missing reel"" included, had authenticity despite its occasional annoyance when infecting the entire screen with black marks everywhere.However, strip away those aesthetic qualities, and the B-movie shine that Rodriguez aimed for suddenly dims. It's too serious in execution to be considered full ""grindhouse"", and that's a shame. Had it embraced the sheer lunacy of its climactic ten minutes throughout the entire feature, Planet Terror could've been bloody special.",Planet Terror

42,Anonymous_Maxine,Might be a little too bizarre even for my taste,5,21 March 2008,"I have to admit that it's definitely a relief to see director Robert Rodriguez return from his inexplicable deviation into the Spy Kids fiasco, it's still true that he hasn't made anything impressive since From Dusk Til Dawn, the second half of which was pretty terrible anyway. Once Upon A Time in Mexico was a total disaster in my opinion, and Sin City was just a little too visceral for me. This Grindhouse feature seems to be Rodriguez almost transparently pandering to his original fans, as though trying to prove to them that he can still do what he does best. Or at least promise that he won't make any more ridiculous children's movies. Desperado, believe it or not, is one of my favorite of Rodiguez's films, along with El Mariachi, Four Rooms, and the first hour or so of From Dusk Til Dawn. Many of his films are criticized for various reasons, I can't think of any of them that at least one or two of my close friends absolutely hated (especially Four Rooms, which I loved, except for the witch story, which was just goofy and boring). Now along comes Planet Terror, and I find myself on the other side of the aisle. It is in true Rodriguez style, with extreme, over-the-top action, way too much blood and goofball heroics. Your typical ""trash"" cinema. Consider, for example, that the movie stars Rose McGowan, no stranger to trashy cinema, and she has a machine gun that doubles as a prosthetic leg. If, after knowing that, you are not sure whether this is the type of movie for you, than you're best off avoiding it. If it sounds like fun, have a ball. Although I should warn you, it sounded like fun to me, and it wasn't. I've said before that I'm beginning to lose my taste for some of the things not uncommon to horror films, like rape scenes and beheading scenes, but I still watch them. There are no rapes or be-headings in Planet Terror, but there is plenty of ghastly gore (not so bad), some pretty gory and grimy sets (also not so bad), some steamy cripple sex (pretty bad), and a guy who collects testicles (I'm sorry, but there is no need for something like this in any movie. Ever).Then again, we must not forget that the movie is shooting for exactly this kind of bizarre extremism. When zombies chew off Cherry's (McGowan) leg, her boyfriend casually tells her there's no use crying about it and expertly attaches the M16 to her severed thigh and she realizes that she's now a stronger person. It reminds me of Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses, which was so clearly a throwback to a time when they were making real horror films, not this cheesy garbage they make today, which look more like date movies for high school boys who want their date to cling to their arm. Take a girl to see House of 1000 Corpses and there's no way you're going to get a kiss at the end of the night (I had a similar experience when I took a girl to see Fight Club, so I guess I shouldn't talk), and Planet Terror has that same feel.But the difference is that Zombie's film was the first true horror film that had been released in years, while Planet Terror is more like the first genuine horror joke that has been released in years, and it's only saving grace is that it knows it's a joke, and flaunts it. It comes as an homage to the time in the 70s and 80s when horror movies were unapologetic and dirty, and didn't seem to care one way or the other about achieving a broad audience (note: the ""broad audience"" is the smoking gun that has murdered modern horror films). The irony is that Rodriguez spent millions recreating that image that the old filmmakers had as long as they spent as little as possible on the productions. Interesting",Planet Terror

But a flop nonetheless.Planet Terror is pulp material, but directed in such a way, that it is enjoyable to watch for cult fans of this genre. The story of Planet Terror isnt really important: it's vulgar, violent, sometimes funny and always (purposely) cheap looking, but in a fascinating way.

44,Vartiainen,"Messy, violent, fun",7,25 April 2012,"At first this movie doesn't seem to have all that much to offer. It seems like any other B-movie with zombies and blatant glorification of violence. And it is that, but in this case it's the style that manages to turn the whole movie upside down. It's supposed to be cheesy, over the top and gory. And that makes it glorious in my eyes. This is perhaps one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen in my life. It's fast, it doesn't care about little details like plot holes, it's full of high impact action scenes, it's openly offensive, it has fan service, it has big guns, it has outrageous and brutal characters, who are all either born badasses or who get killed pretty much immediately. And it has Bruce Willis.In the case of this movie I don't see much point discussing all minor details like which actors were better than the others or how well the costuming works. The overall experience is what matters. This is a movie that needs to be seen and enjoyed, not described and analyzed to the death. Of course there are some aspects of the movie that can be mentioned, like the aged look and all those artificial signs of damaged film reel, or the purposefully missing reel altogether, which all contribute to the overall style and feel of the film, but I'd say that it's much better to just go and see all those minute details yourself.That being the case, what can I say about this film? I can say that it's a blast to witness. It has great action, memorable characters, masterful use of clichés and story-telling conventions, excellent editing, very solid score and a nigh perfect entertainment value. Of course it's not for everyone, being full of violence and fan service, but if you like grindhouse films or are a fan of Quention Tarantino, for example, this movie is made for you.",Planet Terror

After an experimental bio-weapon is accidentally, sort of purpose, released, it turns thousands of people into zombie-like creatures. They'll eat anyone.

46,freemantle_uk,Robert Rodrigeuz's Zombie Homage,8,28 May 2010,"Planet Terror was the first half of Grindhouse, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's homage to low budget, double features of their youth. But when Grindhouse failed in the States Planet Terror and Death Proof were split into two films; with the hope of making more money. But whilst Tarantino is well known to people who to people who don't know film very well giving Death Proof hope, Planet Terror was going to suffer because Robert Rodriquez was not as well know and posters and trailers were only going to appeal to a hardcore audience.Set in a small town in rural Texas a virus is accidentally released after a deal between a scientist, Abby (Naveen Andrews) and military man Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) goes badly wrong. Within the town people start to get inflected and become mindless zombies. Many people have are cause in the middle of it, including go-go dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) who loose her leg, her ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) who has had run-ins with the law and good with guns, the town sheriff (Michael Biehn) who leads the operation and Dr. William Brock (Josh Brolin) and his wife Dr. Dakota Brock (Marley Shelton) who see the zombie spreading first hand as there go through marriage problems.When a film has a poster of a girl with a gun for a leg and has a man who punishes failure by cutting off someone's testicles, then you shouldn't be expecting an art-house classic. Robert Rodriguez knows this is B-Movie and has fun with it: he relishes the action and violence that happens throughout the film and there is plenty of comedy with the over-the-top action. Robert Rodriguez direction was very much like if George A. Romero and John Carpenter had a love child. Freddy Rodriguez was very effective in the action hero role, showing his skills with guns and knifes and had the right sort of build, not too big, not too small. McGowan too was quite good and what can be more fun then seeing a woman with a gun for a leg. Shelton was also a effective heroine and looked plenty damn good. Willis and Brolin offers some gravitas to the film, Willis was of particular note in his small role where he was more of a villainous role for a change.Planet Terror is a exactly what it was meant to be, a parody and homage to low-budget grindhouse of the 70s. Whilst it doesn't match Death Proof for quality it's still a lot of fun. Plus there are a few references to Death Proof.",Planet Terror
47,dfranzen70,Worth seeing for the gun-leg and bloody zombies,7,1 November 2007,"As half of the larger Grindhouse movie (with Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof), Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror is precisely what it aims to be - an homage to cheesy, low-budget zombie movies of the seventies and eighties. Although it's told in a straightforward manner, Planet Terror allows the viewer to enjoy the nostalgia theme ironically, with just enough creeps and scares to be viewed as a honest-to-goodness horror thriller.Seems some kind of noxious nerve gas that changes those who breathe it into flesh-eating zombies has been unleashed into the air at a military base (helpfully called ""Military Base"" on road signs). The army can't help - they might be behind it! So who can save the day? Why, a motley crew of citizens from a nearby town, of course, including a stripper who's just quit her job (Rose McGowan), a tow-truck-driving loner (Freddy Rodriguez), an honest sheriff (Michael Biehn), and a domestically abused doctor (Marley Shelton). Somehow, they must eradicate just enough of the mindless drones to escape to a better clime and find out how to keep the disease from spreading further. Can they do it? Yes they can! As with most Robert Rodriguez movies, there's a lot of style AND substance to go around. For one thing, the movie's very well filmed, from the seamy lighting surrounding J.T.'s Bone Shack to the orderly madness of the local hospital. Heck, even the music sounds authentic, like the producers spent $20 to grab a few songs off of iTunes. Which brings me to the same conundrum I experienced with Death Proof: Why, if these are supposed to be homages to old-time crapfests from the 1970s or so, are there so many nods to modern living? I mean, why not go whole hog and have the movie actually SET in the 1970s? Wouldn't that have made more sense? Eh, doesn't matter too much. Little anachronisms may be an irritant, but the movie's so well put together that you likely won't even notice or mind. Plus, Rodriguez makes up for that - and then some - by mischievously releasing the movie as if it had a missing reel (a reel that was never filmed, it should be noted). Oh, it's priceless. Freddy Rodriguez, as El Wray, is in the middle of coupling with his ex-ex-now-maybe-on-again, Cherry (McGowan) when the film appears to melt and perhaps fall off the reel; the viewer then sees a title card apologizing for the delay, and then POW, we're back in the movie, well further along than when we'd left it. (Humorously, the sheriff thanks El Wray later on for revealing his true identity and calling to the lawman; El Wray nods and tells the sheriff to keep it under his hat. Nudge nudge, wink, wink!) But see, this isn't just about a stripper with a heart of gold warding off hordes of zombies; it's about a legless stripper with a heart of gold. See, early on, Cherry was sideswiped by a transport vehicle as she walked along the side of the road. She somehow caught the disease the zombies would later get, but she was ""saved"" when the good doctors chopped off the offending and infected leg. Heck, for part of the movie she has a table leg wedged into her metal stump, but later on? Later on she gets a machine gun there. Now THAT'S badass! She's a lithe stripper, you see, able to bend and twist and fire the gun wherever she wants. That Cherry, she has quite the assets, doesn't she? McGowan and F. Rodriguez are both great, and so's the well-picked supporting cast, including Biehn as the intrepid sheriff and Jeff Fahey as his brother, a restaurateur. Oh, and Michael Parks, who's played the same kindly Texas Ranger Earl McGraw, who's been in both Kill Bill films and Tarantino's Death Proof, not to mention From Dusk Till Dawn (also directed by Rodriguez), and he's wryly amusing here. Heck, Bruce Willis appears unbilled, too. Tarantino's in it as well; he's actually half-decent as an actor, although his turn in Death Proof was a bit more entertaining.In all, Planet Terror serves as a grimy reminder of just how deservedly unsung those cranked-out crapfests were back in the day, back when you'd pay a nickel for a double feature, and that included popcorn, by gum! The characters are appropriately shallowly written, although often the actors add just enough depth to make the movie worthwhile, even nonironically.",Planet Terror

But it shows RR in his magnificent best, the guy is an unrelenting force... Sort of like a human version of that huge ball that chases Harry Ford through a tunnel in Raiders of the Lost Fart, Rodriguez is a force unstoppable. And this sinister unstoppable golem has created THE BEST EVER Zombie Flick. If not the best, it is very high on the pile.What makes it so good is partially, Rosie MacGowan. What a DOLL. Good actress too.These girls are very easy to look at, but they are even better at making us believe they are who they depict. This film was WELL cast, and I like that there was a continuity between this cast and QT's cast for Death Proof, including Michael Parks ""Earl Mcgraw"" character.Rodriguez is now a bona-fide master of the Genesis camera- His technique is unsurpassed- He uses his tools to create the highest level of what I would call CAMP (But don't all camp at al), which started in ""From Dusk till Dawn"" and reaches the pinnacle HERE, and so we have an Anti-CAMP... Cos where you are not laughing you are jumping in your seat and watching the show through your fingers.And this is where I hope I am wrong. I certainly hope that RR has NOT reached any kind of peak... NOT YET at least.Everything about this flick is tops: Great shots, special effects that are characters in the story and not just gratuitous explosions and gore. Speaking of which, last several flicks I saw Tom Savini he was getting it good, and this flick, he gets it better than all of his other sudden endings. Except for that he was not wearing his Dick-Gunala ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""The only thing that is misleading about this flick are the posters that show Marley Shelton, eyeliner running, two Syringes poised to inflict ""Red Headed Girlfriend"" into QT's demented arse... But it was just a poster, for a Grindhouse flick, and therefore it does not have to be from an actual SCENE from the flick... I would have LOVED to see THAT in the flick, but it was just a poster pic.If I were to insert one spoiler, I would say, I like the way that... The Ball-Collecting Biochemist, parts his hair.

49,MaxBorg89,"Wild, bloody and deliriously entertaining: Fun with a capital ""f""!",10,9 August 2007,"Because of low box office returns in the USA (total gross: 25 million $; movie's budget: 100 million), that outrageously mouth-watering experiment known as Grindhouse was split in half for the European release: first came Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, a masterful reinvention of the slasher flick, the main strength of which was focusing on characters and atmosphere rather than film references; and now comes Planet Terror, Robert Rodriguez's zombie opus which has ""excessive"" (read: fun) written all over it.That this is going to be a different cinematic experience is obvious before the movie's even started, as it is preceded by the RIP (Rodriguez International Pictures) logo and the fake trailer Machete (the other three are not included in the separate cut), starring Danny Trejo: a bona fide B-movie advert, so gloriously OTT the MPAA would never approve it in real life (swearing, nudity and explicit violence: not good). After that, it's straight into the action: some virus turns people into flesh-eating freaks, spreading panic all over the country. While most poor fools get eaten, a small group organizes some kind of resistance. These people include Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), a former go-go dancer, her ex-boyfriend and martial arts expert El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), a nurse (Marley Shelton) who is about to leave her husband (Josh Brolin) and a few law enforcers (Michael Parks, playing Earl McGraw for the fourth time, and Michael Biehn). Against them, aside from the zombies, is the military, who for some reason wants to keep the virus around. And as the inevitable final battle approaches, the blood keeps flowing freely.At first sight, Planet Terror may seem like the lesser of the two Grindhouse halves, mainly because the director, unlike Tarantino who made the separate version of Death Proof longer and better-looking, hasn't modified his segment at all (aside from reinserting half an hour worth of excised material): the scratches and aging signs are still there, and the ""missing reel"" (a love scene between the two leads) is still missing. But that's probably because Rodriguez, in true B-movie tradition, was more concerned with the style, of which the aging stuff is an integral part. So, while it is undeniable that QT's episode is superior artistically speaking (smarter script, better dialogue, more artful direction), it is equally undeniable that RR, knowing he can't bring anything new to the genre (George Romero and 28 Days Later... have already done it), puts all his energy in the execution (pun not intended) and delivers exactly what the audience demands: from sexy start to gory finish, Planet Terror is a 105-minute long, shamelessly overblown money shot, a picture that dumps all pretensions and sets out to simply entertain.The focus on blood and guts (and there's plenty of them), however, does not make the film a mere exercise in style, because while he may not be as skilled a writer as his partner, RR manages to deliver some memorable lines (a satirical stab at Bin Laden being the standout) and craft excessive yet immediately likable characters, all played with almost puerile joy by a terrific cast: McGowan, who was killed off immediately in Death Proof, makes up for it here by giving flesh (and what flesh) to one of the toughest babes ever to hit a screen (the image of her with a machine gun instead of her missing leg is already iconic); Freddy Rodriguez, having stolen scenes for five years in Six Feet Under, is completely at ease in the role that should make him an A-lister; Naveen Andrews, best known for playing Sayid on Lost, has the fun of a lifetime shaking off his nice guy image as a testicle-collecting (!) scientist; and finally, people like Bruce Willis and Tarantino (whose part is ten times as crazy and hilarious as his Death Proof cameo) pop up briefly to memorable effect for one simple reason: they just want to have a good time.A good time: that is all Planet Terror has to offer, no more, no less. And those seeking sheer entertainment, albeit delivered with gusto, should be able to enjoy this riotous adventure, as long as they are able to stomach sequences so insanely violent they make Desperado or Kill Bill look like children's flicks.

His half of the Tarantino Grindhouse feature is a blood soaked splatter fest, there's mutant-infected zombie things attacking a texas town & beautiful ladies running around with machine guns & an Awesome cast of B-movie & cult film stars.Planet Terror isn't as good as his ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" & probably not as good as his ""Machete"" but his zombie epidemic Horror is just as fun, Rodriguez gives it plenty of silly & way over the top action & humour but all in a cool B-movie fun style.The visual style & look is genius, the picture is grainy & scratchy just like those old 60's,70's & 80's trashy B-flicks it's pretending to be!!!
He has the style done perfectly, the music is great too with it's very synthesized sounds & sax music it's so 70's & early 80's it's great.I know this GRINDHOUSE experience flopped at the box office but who cares? Not me as i loved it, both feature films are excellent, ""Death Proof"" Tarantino's tribute to slasher & Road Rage B-movie Horror of the 60's & 70's is just as excellent as Planet Terror, probably the better of the two...maybe? Both great.I absolutely love old school Horror & old B-movie Genre flicks, splatter Zombie films & exploitation cinema, all that great stuff from the graveyard of cinema, so i absolutely love what those two fantastic genius Directors was trying to do & in my humble movie geek opinion they totally nailed it!!!Planet Terror is a pure fun & silly Horror-Comedy Thriller that is made up from all those late night bloody old school Genre films we grew up watching!!!

While the soldiers search for a cure, they infected other people in the town instead. After Cherry losing her leg from these monsters, her ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) comes to help her. While a group of survivors are trying to figure out... how to get out of this town before the ""gas"" infects the whole entire world.Written and Directed by Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi Trilogy, Spy Kids Trilogy, Sin City) made an entertaining, goofy action/sci-fi/horror with plenty of thrills and refreshing sense of humour. Rodriguez recaptures the spirit of the sleazy exploitation of the 1970's flicks. This was meant to look like a extremely bad movie with it's scratched-up print, occasionally bad audio sound and of course, the infamous missing reel. Which it's works perfectly well in the film and what makes ""Planet Terror"" interesting to watch as well. McGowan offers an fresh, funny performance as the unwilling victim turns heroine. The cast seems to be having a great time as well with memorable performances. Which it also stars:Marley Shelton, Josh Brolin, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Tom Savini, Michael Parks, Fergie Ferguson and more.DVD has an excellent anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an informative commentary by the directed, which it is delightful and giving plenty of trivia. The audio commentary track is a few moments of dead-air but it's certainly worth a listen, if you are a fan of the movie. DVD also has Audience Reaction Track. Which it's fun to listen to hear it, especially if you got a home theater. Disc One also has International Trailer & Poster Gallery. Disc Two has six entertaining featurettes, which some of informative. Especially the alternative sequences of the director's son Rebel is been kept alive in the whole movie. Which Rodriguez mentions in the featurettes, we also get to see footage of it as well.The ""extended and unrated"" edition of this film is certainly hard to tell, what footage they added in this cut. Which in the Rodriguez commentary, he points them out... what's new in this version. The only thing i noticed before listening to the commentary was the few extra added gory shots and a end credit sequence. Which the original theatrical cut of ""Grindhouse"" didn't have an end credit sequence. It was tied together for the end credits of the second feature. Rodriguez also mention that the ""Grindhouse"" theatrical cut will be release in DVD someday with the fake, appealing, hilarious trailers. Rodriguez's fake preview ""Machete"" starring Danny Trejo, Jeff Fahey and Cheech Marin is intact in this new cut. The missing reel is still the same. I thought Rodriguez filmed or written a sequence, when the love scene started between Cherry and El Wray started then it's completely cuts to the Restaurant getting burned. But the director points out in his commentary, it was always intended that way. Which it was a great laugh in the theaters. Unlike the Tarantino extended cut of ""Death Proof"" has the missing reel back in the movie.""Planet Terror"" is certainly a lot of fun to watch. Some viewers actually enjoy this film more than ""Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof"". But i loved both films, i think they are excellent double-features. Especially in the original theatrical cut with the false trailers before the films started. Which both films and the sleazy trailers has the occasional jump cuts, bad looking print, poor audio track and the missing reels are placed cleverly in the two pictures. But sadly, it was a box office disappointment. Because of this, both films got separately and run longer in Overseas. Which it's the versions are out on DVD. But i have to admit that ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" were so much fun to watch in the big screen. It feels different watching it on DVD, it is not quite the same experience. But it's certainly the most enjoyable Rodriguez film to my taste since ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Don't miss it. (**** ½/*****).",Planet Terror
52,kairingler,Planet Rodriguez,8,18 April 2009,"this is the first part to the Grindhouse picture. Robert Rodriguez does a fine job here presenting us his homage to the late 70's grindhouse flicks. Quentin Tarantino even has a small role in here as a rapist. Rose Mcgowan steals the show in this one with her sensual sexuality as a go go dancer, Josh Brolin also is pretty good as the hero,, Bruce Willis is also in here as a Commander for the Military. I don't know if i should say this but i think i'm tired of zombie movies now,, and you know it's not really this particular movie that does it for me,, it all of the recent zombie movies in the last 5 years, this one is different and pretty good nonetheless.",Planet Terror
53,slokes,One Helluva Zombie Flick,8,18 November 2013,"A powerhouse action-thriller packed with blood and practically every human body part imaginable, ""Planet Terror"" is a surprisingly savage joy. It not only works its exploitation genre literally inside-out, but does so with considerable cleverness and humor.One foggy Wednesday night, a number of apparent gangrene victims flood a Texas hospital. Could this be related to some bad goings-on at an abandoned Army base some miles away? Is humanity's one hope a mostly silent man who goes by the name ""El Wray"" and his one-legged girlfriend? Should viewers be ready for some surprise cameos and shameless gross-out gags?Oh, yes.Originally partnered with Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" under the title ""Grindhouse,"" as a double-feature celebration of '70s Grade-B hardcore action movies, ""Planet Terror"" gives you a gripping story that features a diverse array of characters and several subplots, all of which mesh together very well while keeping the ultra-violent action flowing.Even when writer-director Robert Rodriguez doesn't have an idea completely worked out, he manages to cover for it cleverly by exploiting the exploitation genre itself, serving up a ""missing reel"" to fast-forward the film through what might well have been a tedious explanation phase.""Thank you for telling me aboutyou know,"" says a sheriff (Michael Biehn) who had previously been suspicious about El Wray's true identity.""Don't mention it,"" El Wray (Freddy Rodriquez) replies. I don't usually like splatter films, and there's no question ""Planet Terror"" is firmly in that camp. There's one scene in a doctor's office featuring a projection screen I honestly have to look away from whenever I watch it, but the rest of the film is so good I just wince through it. While many scenes have shock value, there's also a comic quality to them, particularly when you watch them again. If ""Planet Terror"" has a moral, it might be that while watching one human die is deeply tragic, watching them die by the scores can be a hoot.The film is also rich with great one-liners, many of them delivered by Rose McGowan as the very arch and pliable Cherry Darling. Two lines now have worked their way into becoming mantras for my workday: ""It's go-go, not cry-cry,"" and ""No dead bodies for Da-Da tonight.""The vibe is very '80s John Carpenter, including some electronic music elements lifted from Carpenter films and a spooky hospital that looks right out of the first ""Halloween II"". You got fog, shambling mounds of human flesh, and sudden musical stings employed as false alarms. I don't think the Carpenter movies were as consistently fun as this, though.If there's a legitimate criticism of ""Planet Terror,"" it is that it plays things a bit too cute at the expense of developing its characters. But even that can be argued as a necessary evil in order to give the film its fast tempo. Since what you are watching is a salute to a type of film that was often unapologetically cheesy, even ""Planet Terror's"" minor flaws in storycraft and technical effects work to sell the larger whole. The result is a film that not only gives you quite a ride, but makes you want to get back on when it's over.",Planet Terror
54,dworldeater,By far the better of the two films in the Grindhouse double feature,8,21 September 2019,"In my opinion, The other half of this feature Death Proof sucked and was a big disapointment. Robert Rodriguez however, did not let me down. This is a fast paced, action packed, bullet and bloodsoaked gorefest that fans of low budget 70's and 80's drive in horror and action flicks will love. Definetely trashy and tongue in cheek with the film looking extra grainy to give maximum authenticity to the exploitation style. I really dug this when it got its theatrical release and I must say it still holds up. Although this is a homage to some cheaply made movies, this had a big budget and great cast and f/x. Also this has a Machete trailer, which was so well recieved, Robert Rodriguez would actually go ahead and make it, which made the world a better place. Planet Terror is a cool movie and Robert Rodriguez needs to make that Machete In Space movie. I would pay to see that and really needs to happen soon.",Planet Terror
55,TOMNEL,A hilarious dose of nonsense.,9,15 October 2007,"Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse film ""Planet Terror"" might be the film that's had me laughing the most this year. It is a downright hilarious spoof, and it doesn't try to be anything else. The whole movie is lots of action, lots of purposely cheesy dialogue and silly scenes that only serve the purpose to make the audience laugh.Rose McGowan plays Cherry Darling, a mistreated pole dancer who more than anything wants a drastic change in her life. She bumps into her old boyfriend, simply known as El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), and then the action picks up. The government has released toxic gases that turn people into zombies, and it's up to Cherry, Wray and several other locals to save the day.This plot may sound rather stupid, and it is. But that's the point. Unlike Planet Terror's sister film ""Death Proof"", this movie is a spoof. Not even really an homage, but it's a spoof of clichéd bad movies, and because the audience knows not to take this goofy movie seriously, it's extremely entertaining, and a must see.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 86 mins. (Grindhouse version). 100 mins. (DVD version). rated R for graphic violence, language and some sexuality.",Planet Terror
56,valleyjohn,Dumb,6,28 May 2021,"As much as I love Tarantino, I never did get his love for reproducing these C movie exploitation flicks .This is directed by Robert Rodriguez with Tarantino acting ( badly ) in it and was part of a double bill called Grindhouse . This is much more inferior than Tarantino directed Death Proof but even that is seen at QT's worst film by far .After an experimental bio-weapon is released, turning thousands into zombie-like creatures, it's up to a rag-tag group of survivors to stop the infected and those behind its release.If you like your gore then this will be perfect for you . It's not like a horror , it's more like a comedy zombie movie sadly nowhere near as funny as Shaun Of The Dead , The Evil Dead or Zombieland.I found the film incredibly silly . I suppose that was the point Rodriguez was trying to make as a homage to the original Grindhouse movies .It's has the the old trailers , Including Machete, which was actually made three years later .It's made to look like it's filmed on celluloid but to be honest it fails because it looks so fake .There is a reason why these film were seen as rubbish back in the day , so I'm confused as to why they thought that they could change peoples minds by reliving that era.Dumb.",Planet Terror
57,a_chinn,Rodriguez's best film is delightfully unrestrained,10,21 October 2017,"I think this might arguably be Robert Rodriguez's best, and he has some pretty ones (""Sin City"" is probably a close second). Rodriguez is not an art-house director by any means, but he is a director of wildly entertaining films and I think this may be his most entertaining, though I'll also say this film probably has the narrowest audience appeal. The story is a zombie one about a government experiment gone wrong that infects the populace of a small Texas town, but this film is unique in that it was one half of Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" double feature, that tried to recreate the experience of going to rundown theaters and watching low budget explorations films of the 1970s, complete with fake exploitation film trailers, damaged film prints, and missing reels to round out the experience. That's what I think limits the film's appeal to a wide audience, because not only does Rodriguez embrace the visual aesthetics of these films, he also fully embraces the ratcheted up sex and violence of these same exploitation films that he's celebrating, which is not going to appeal to all audience members. I can't speak from personal experience in regards to attending grindhouse theaters, but I can attest to watching many of these films during the VHS heyday. Those VHS video gems did include cheesy trailers for cheap low budget films and often did include poor film transfers that included damaged film prints, so even for a gen-xer like me, this film provided a lot of nostalgia. Freddy Rodríguez is the hero of the film who helps save his stripper girlfriend, Rose McGowan, from zombies. In the process McGowan loses her leg, which is eventually replaced with an M-16. Josh Brolin plays a terrifically villainous doctor after his ex-wife Marley Shelton. I think this was the first film I saw him in where I realized this guy can really act and isn't just the guy from ""Goonies"" and ""Thrashin'"". You also have Jeff Fahey, Michael Biehn, Fergie, Nicky Katt and Bruce Willis. A great touch is that Willis is never shown in the same shot as the rest of the cast, which was a favorite trick of exploitation films who would hire one major (usually fading) start to film one or two days worth of footage that could be inserted into the rest of the film, then giving producers the opportunity to boast about the films' fabulous cast. Rodriguez pretty much summed up this love letter to exploitation films of yore when he said, ""The posters were much better than the movies, but we're actually making something that lives up to the posters."" and he absolutely did!",Planet Terror
58,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Grindhouse/Exploitation Take on the Zombie Film,8,2 April 2020,"This was a film that I was actually mad at myself for missing in the theaters, but I definitely checked out this one and Death Proof on DVD soon after its release. I'm a fan of good zombies films, so I was definitely intrigued by this one and it was right around the time that I started to get into more of the exploitation/grindhouse films after seeing Cannibal Holocaust for the first time. I did get the chance when it came to the Gateway Film Center as the double feature version. The synopsis is after an experimental bio-weapon is released turning thousands into zombie-like creatures; it's up to a rag-tag group of survivors to stop the infected and those behinds its release.We start this off with a Go-Go Dancer, Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) dancing over the credits. At the end of it, she is crying and we get the idea that she wants something more. She quits that night and heads out into the night. She runs into an ex-boyfriend, El Wray (Freddy Rodríguez). He is a tow truck driver and their encounter happens at a local BBQ spot that is ran by J.T. Hague (Jeff Fahey).On Cherry's way to the BBQ place, she made eye contact with Dr. Crane (Hung Ngyuyen). He goes to the local military base where he meets with Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis). They are brokering a deal, but it turns into a double-cross with a strange chemical being released in the air. Dr. Crane is taken hostage.El Wray gets into a car accident and Cherry is taken. He produces a rifle to go save her and finds that one of her leg has been ripped off below the knee. El Wray fights them off and takes her to the hospital. It is there that we meet Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin). He is married to Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton). William has trouble controlling his temper though. He knows there is something up and doesn't realize that Dakota is planning to run away with her lover, Tammy Visan (Stacy Ferguson).To make things even more complicated, Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) doesn't trust El Wray and neither does his deputy, Tolo (Tom Savini). Things all take quite the turn though when people who are infected by something become blood thirsty zombies. It becomes a fight for survival and figuring out a way to put a stop to all of this before it is too late.I wanted to go a bit lighter on the recap of this film, as there are some funny and wild things that happen here. Something else about this film though is not so much the story, as it isn't that complex. There is some depth there due to the amount of characters and it is interesting how they all end up interacting. Something I want to commend here as well is the realism of making this into a grindhouse film. There are fake trailers before and after the film, which I'm all about, as some have gone on to become movies themselves.Keeping with the theme of the film being grindhouse, the story is outrageous. The zombie aspects of it are good though. They aren't super strong or anything like that, but the rules are lax at times. I do think they do some interesting things with them though and these ones are completely traditional. They are turned from chemicals, but some of them are able to maintain their human characteristics, at least somewhat. There's an interesting way to keep from turning as well.Something that I did like are the characters, El Wray is hiding a secret that Lt. Muldoon knows and even Sheriff Hague knows of him. Cherry isn't your typical Go-Go dancer. She did have higher dreams, but settled on this job. The dynamic between William and Dakota is interesting. I also love her angle with her needles. It is just things like that add to the outrageousness of film and make it even more fun though on top of it.I did like that this is almost like a shared universe with Quentin Tarantino. The dialogue here is a bit over the top, but it still has that feel that he does in his films. It is also interesting as the character of Earl McGraw (Michael Parks) makes an appearance in Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez's joint film of From Dusk Till Dawn. He's also in Death Proof, the second half of this double feature along with Dakota.That brings me to the pacing of the film, which I think is great. Something I normally hate is when there are aspects of the story that aren't fully fleshed out. Being this is a grindhouse film, they have a missing reel that tells the complete back-story of El Wray and what happens to cause the survivors to flee from the BBQ place. In this case, I think it is not only hilarious but keeps in vein with these types of films. They weren't always taken the best care of, so a reel could be missing. How the film plays out is good and keeps it interesting. The ending isn't my favorite, but it is in line with what they're parodying for sure.What really carries this film for me is the acting. McGowan is great in this film. She is funny with what happens to her leg, which is a major part of the film. I think she plays the character with such a heavy heart and I love the growth there. She is also beautiful. Rodríguez I thought was really good as well. He plays the character with such mystery that it works as well. Brolin is good as he is a doctor, but he is a villain as well. There are signs of toxic masculinity that works. Shelton is also gorgeous and I liked the difficult role she plays that she is partially paralyzed for a good stretch of the film. I loved the performances by Fahey and Biehn. It was fun to see cameos by Willis, Savini and Tarantino. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed, which is over the top acting and beautiful women.To move next to the effects of the film, I actually gave a little fist pump to see Greg Nicotero's name. It looks like 2/3rds of the KNB team were here and you could tell. The practical effects not only looked real, but were gross. There is a bit more CGI than I would have liked, especially in the vein of these type of films. It does actually work though because there are some wild things that happened. It would probably nearly impossible to make look real and since the film is outrageous, I'll let it slide. I also love the realism that is there with having the film look like it is from the grindhouse era as well. It really adds character to and it is also shot beautifully as well.Now with that said, this film is a lot of fun. It is outrageous and I'm on-board for it. It is keeping with the era that this film paying homage to. The zombie aspect of the film is good as well. I think it is paced in a way to keep it interesting and never getting boring. The ending isn't my favorite, but it is in line with the genre. The acting really helps to carry the film and effects do as well. The soundtrack of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it definitely fit for what was needed and helps to enhance the scenes from what I remember. I'm a big fan of this film and I would say that it is really good. I would only recommend it though if you like zombie films or grindhouse era films of the 1970's.",Planet Terror
59,lastliberal-853-253708,Now THAT'S a rump roast,8,11 March 2012,"Sure, I was one of the fanboys who wouldn't miss the latest Robert Rodriguez classic when it came out in the theater, but seeing it for the third time was even better. I just can't get enough of Rose McGowan, and being up close and personal with her was a real thrill.This is, without a doubt, one of the best zombie movies ever made.This film was almost non-stop action from start to finish. Blood by the buckets, and heads exploding everywhere. It had enough to satisfy any zombie lover.Besides McGowan as the badass Cherry Darling, who gives us a sizzling, steamy, and sexy scene with only one leg , there was also Freddy Rodríguez from ""Six Feet Under"", Marley Shelton, certifiably on of the sexiest women in the world, Fergie, Naveen Andrews, and The Man - Bruce Willis.A rocking good time!",Planet Terror
60,davidmvining,A fun flick that embraces the grindhouse aesthetic fully,7,25 November 2019,"Robert Rodriguez really leaned into the grindhouse aspect of this effort, but all of it was done using his own personal digital tools like all of his movies. Digital damage to the film stock, digital effects, and digital color timing were combined with an array of analogue tools to create a trashy zombie epic in about 80 minutes.The first half hour of this movie is kind of a drag. The biggest single problem with the film is that there are way too many characters running around. There's the stripper who wants to be the comedienne, the wrecking truck driver, the cop, the BBQ restaurant owner, a pair of married doctors and their son, a woman from out of town, and that's all before we get to the evil military agents and the guy who collects people's balls. Each one gets some little moment that will end up playing out later to some degree, but when you're dealing with introducing a cast this large in such a short movie, it gets in the way of the more genre based fun the movie wants to have.Anyway, through all of these introductions, we're getting the sense that something's going wrong. There's the military trucks driving through the night, spreading and very gross diseases on people's skin, and the girl who suddenly gets eaten by some freaks on the side of the road. It's all kind of rote type of buildup, and when matched with the long list of characters, it becomes a bit of a chore to sit through.However, once we get through the build up and all of the introductions, the movie suddenly becomes kind of fun, increasing that sense of it until the end. It's ridiculous and silly in its grossness and nihilism, but the movie's desire to entertain through excess ends up working in its favor, assuming you can take the level of disgusting gore coming your way.All of the characters collect at the BBQ joint before past secrets get exposed that don't matter very much and they take the offensive against the increasing zombie horde. They eventually make their way to the local military base and meet Bruce Willis, who explains the nonsense science behind the plague wrecking the small community and threatening to spread far beyond, and violence ensues again.The movie is filled with design choices that feel both low tech and stupid but high tech and clever at the same time. There's the famous image of Rose McGowan with her machine gun leg, of course, which makes no sense whatsoever but is entertaining in a stupid sort of way. There's the devices the military men wear that feeds them the stuff that keeps them from becoming gross monsters. Sets are fun, especially where the evil toxin is stored several stories down within the military base.It's an amusing way to spend 80 minutes, though it gets so gross that it will limit appeal. Still, it understands the kind of movie it is and leans into the genre to some entertaining effect. It's not a great piece of cinema, but it's a fun flick.",Planet Terror
61,RatedVforVinny,An imitation of the real thing.,6,14 December 2019,"Enjoyable but contrived cult movie, that obviously tries way to hard to impress.

62,RainDogJr,Poor Tarantino (The Rapist),10,18 June 2008,"For some reasons I missed the chance to see Tarantino's segment on the big screen (it has a very limited release) and that reason made me buy finally the imported DVD of it (also and mostly because it has finally a decent price). RR's segment was finally released last Friday (a limited release yet in more theaters than Death Proof, don't ask me why) and this time I didn't miss the chance to see at least one part of Grindhouse as must be seen. The first thing was the warning about that the ""damaged footage"" was made on purpose to make a 70's look. Soon after Machete; ""They just f*cked with the wrong Mexican"", says the tag line first for this fake film but now for this upcoming feature by Robert Rodriguez. Finally the feature presentation: RR's Planet Terror; somewhere in Texas and because military factors, a virus is release. The consequences are chaotic but could and will be worst with more and more people infected. In matter of the protagonists we have two ex-lovers, El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) and Cherry (Rose McGowan), a couple, Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and Dakota (Marley Shelton), and some other characters that eventually will be the non-infected survivors. The police station, the restaurant Bone Shack and the hospital are some of the local places where we are going to have amazing action, a lot of ""zombies"", some needles, lots of fun and, unfortunately, a missing reel. Is quite funny that the missing reel ruins the sex scene of Rose but is more funny how immediately, after the picture is back, is all on fire, the Sheriff has been shot and everybody knows who was in the past El Wray. All of this just before the group of survivors finally meets the Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) and knows more about the virus. The last memorable moments of the film includes the performance of Tarantino; his appearance is as memorable as his joke in Desperado or even more. Poor Quentin (The Rapist), ""went to get his dick wet"" and believe me, he ends really really bad. The other memorable thing is of course the leg-gun and also the end in Mexico.Well Planet Terror is an amazingly entertaining picture with great special effects in a fun way. Now after watching both films in their extended cuts (Death Proof on DVD and this on the big screen) I have to say that I loved both. The Grindhouse concept worked in the way of the damaged prints, fake trailers and all those touches but just remember that both are $50 million B-movies. Anyway, now if you ask me which film I prefer, I still don't know but one thing is for sure: Grindhouse was the best project of 2007 and the results are for me two of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of last year. By the way and finally, the score of this film is terrific (inspired by John Carpenter's scores) as the soundtrack of the other part.",Planet Terror

65,brando647,Rodriguez's GRINDHOUSE!!!,9,21 January 2009,"Here is Robert Rodriguez's contribution to ""Grindhouse"", in my opinion the best film from 2007. Rodriguez's film is an homage to the campy zombie horror films from the 1970's, complete with excessive violence/gore, sexuality, deliberately bad dialogue, and a well-timed missing reel. As an added bonus, he gave the entire movie a look of worn/scratched/faded film as if the reel had seen better days. In the film, a Texas town becomes over-ridden with flesh-hungry sickos after a biochemical is released into the air and a group of survivors (led by a mysterious stranger and a one-legged go-go dancer) must fight to escape.I can't begin to explain how much I loved this movie. It attempts to be one of those ""so-bad-its-good"" flicks but comes out as something much greater. The acting is eccentric and over-the-top, with an awesome cast including Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton, Bruce Willis, and plenty more. Josh Brolin was fantastic as the evil/creepy Dr. William Block and I got a kick out of Freddy Rodriguez's over-acting as the mysterious Wray. The writing is sharp and the movie never takes itself too seriously.For fans of cheesy gore/violence, this film has PLENTY to go around. Explosions occur frequently (sometimes without reason), people are torn apart, flesh is consumed, etc. There are some serious gross-out moments in this film, even for those who consider themself desensitized (i.e. the tongue blister...). My favorite moment has to be when Quentin Tarantino makes a cameo appearance as a soldier attempting to rape Cherry Darling (McGowan); his transformation was awesomely sickening and reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"".I'm sure there is a lot about this movie for people not to like, as this film will definitely NOT appeal to everyone. I've read a lot of complaints about the film, but it seems that most people who speak poorly of it don't see what Rodriguez was going for. Then again, there are also a lot of people who detest this genre. So, as long as you don't fall into those categories and want some great mind-numbing entertainment, this is it.",Planet Terror
66,sme_no_densetsu,Semi-entertaining at best,6,6 June 2008,"As you should already know, this is the companion film to Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". In my opinion, Rodriguez hasn't got half the talent that Tarantino has but he does strike gold from time to time. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times.The film is a throwback to another era but I didn't think that it has quite the same level of authenticity as ""Death Proof"". Strangely, one of the 'problems' in that regard is that the acting is too good to belong in a trashy horror flick. Also, the special effects are a cut above the usual lackluster efforts that you'd normally see in other films of this ilk. The story, on the other hand, is as ridiculous as you might expect (though that was presumably on purpose).Rodriguez's direction isn't too bad but I don't find it noteworthy in any way. His script is also nothing to write home about though there are a few somewhat memorable moments. Rodriguez also did the music, which I thought was merely alright. Overall, the level of craftsmanship is about average.The story bored me for the most part, though. I didn't care about any of the characters so I found it hard to get into the movie. One problem, in my opinion, is that the film tries to do too much. Instead of concentrating more on Cherry & Wray there are a handful of other story lines, most of which are not developed properly.If you like trashy horror films then you'll likely enjoy this one too. As for the rest of us, this is just another mindless zombie film to avoid.",Planet Terror
67,Screen_Blitz,"Robert Rodriguez's zombie horror is fun, nonetheless quite faulty in style",6,12 February 2016,"Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaborate to make an action-horror double feature known as Grindhouse, where the movies are filmed to obtain the looks of old exploitation films from the 70s and 80s. With Quentin Tarantino's action feature 'Death Proof' dealing with a psychotic Hollywood stuntman preying a woman with his black Chevrolet Nova, this half directed by Robert Rodriguez pays a homage to vintage zombie horror B-movies with over-the-top action and blood and gore. This feature follows Cherry (played by Rose McGowan), a sexy stripper with a shady ex-boyfriend Wray (played by Freddy Rodriguez) living in a small Texas town that soon becomes under attacked when a biomedical experiment goes awry and releases a toxic gas that mutates people into gruesome, flesh-eating monsters. Cherry, Wray, and her father join alliance with Dakota Block (played by Marley Shelton), a nurse and mother who is secretly cheating on her husband Will (played by Josh Brolin), local sheriff Hague (played by Michael Biehn), and several other town residents to fight against the flesh-eating zombie onslaught that threaten their town. Bruce Willis makes an appearance as an army lieutenant who witnesses the downfall of the experiment that leads the town in extreme turmoil. Opening a fake movie trailer starring Danny Trejo as the action hero ""Machete"" who makes an appearance in many of Rodriguez's later films, this film, in my opinion, offers a bit more excitement and storytelling than Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof'. It brings the intense zombie action and aggressively over-the-top blood and gore to make every zombie fan blush, not to mention a surprisingly likable cast including Quentin Tarantino makes a cameo appearance. With the vintage cinematography, the film pays a solid homage to the classic action and horror flicks that gained pop cult status in later years of their release. However, the main flaw is that director Robert Rodriguez takes his vintage filming style a bit too seriously, to the point of it being needlessly distracting. The grainy film format can be diverting enough for those not in favor of a degenerate style of filmmaking. The style only becomes more off- putting with the absurdly awkward editing, one example lies at the halfway point with the movie breaking into a brief intermission with the sight of a simulated film reel burning obliviously, filling the screen with flames, and then skipping a portion of the film's storyline. Rodriguez seems to embrace the filmmaking style highly over the characters to where the cinematography serves more as the star of the film than the characters. Those who are able to look past the distracting cinematography, however, will find luxury in the fast-paced plot, the intoxicating zombie shootouts, and Rose McGowan's character mowing down with her machine gun-replaced leg. The cast's performances are not particularly stand strong, but as the film pays a homage to old films that lacked stellar acting, many may find somewhat forgivable.Planet Terror is a fun and entertaining zombie action flick, but a bit faulty in terms of style. I personally find this half of Grindhouse more entertaining than 'Death Proof', though Death Proof is slightly improving in cinematography. This film is worth watching for all Robert Rodriguez fans, and a definite no-go for the faint of heart as this film is piled with absurd amount of gore and violence from start to finish.",Planet Terror
68,oneguyrambling,Pure insanity. B movie awesomeness.,8,10 December 2010,"No-one was more excited than me when Tarantino and Rodriguez announced they would double-bill a pair of B movies simultaneously.Imagine my surprise and disappointment when Tarantino decided that making the film ""look scratchy"" and whacking a couple of old school ads before the film would suffice.Rodriguez in the other hand made the ultimate ode to dodgy drive-in entertainment in Planet Terror.The plot is largely irrelevant aside from allowing Rodriguez to stage numerous set pieces and fill the screen with ""oh my god did he just do that?"" gore and buckets of fake blood. And because we know Rodriguez seems to have a hand in almost every step of production, editing and directing (he even does his own music!) you know he got messy making this one.Back to the plot of sorts; Naughty guys have a chemical weapon that some soldiers want bad. The chemical is released into the air and instantly turns almost everyone in the town to mindless cannibalistic zombies. Those that are immune - or just yet to be eaten - may hold the key to a cure that might save the rest of the world, they band together and attempt to fight their way to safety.Nowwwww What you reeeeealllly need to know: Who's in it? - Rose McGowan is a local go-go dancer (NOT stripper) named Cherry. (Though she looked like a stripper to me.) - Bruce Willis is the leader of the soldiers.Fergie - destroyer of the Black Eyed Peas as a credible unit - features - Josh Brolin is a prick of a husband and a Doctor, his missus is leaving him for another woman and he is none too pleased about it.Freddie Rodriguez (a relo?) is Ray, a mysterious guy with a mysterious past and 1,001 schmoove moves.Michael Beihn, Michael Parks and Tom Savini are local cops.Quentin Tarantino is a rapist.What happens? - A bad guy collects the ""balls"" of his victims as souvenirs and keeps them in a jar. Really.Fergie dies. Violently. (YAY!!) - Cherry has a leg eaten off.There is a promising sex scene that is short cut by a ""reel missing"" cheat by Rodriguez, who apparently hooked up with McGowan while making this.There's a nice ""alternate reality"" Bin Laden story.Some of the worst nudity in cinematic history since Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates shared a bath.The same helicopter rotor gag as 28 Weeks Later. (I looked, both came out in 2007! Chicken or egg?) - How about a MACHINE-GUN LEG!! Awwwww Yeeeeaaahhh! This film is basically 100+ minutes of frenzied film-making. There is always something happening on screen even when there is not. All in all Planet Terror is a deliciously delirious blend of action, horror, black humour, gore, crazy FX and over the top shlock, mostly involving free flowing blood and pus. Only everything a grown boy needs really.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. B Movie perfection. I never grow tired of this film. It's just sad Tarantino made such a momentum killer that this has never received its due.",Planet Terror
69,Pumpkin_Man,An Awesome Grindhouse Film!!!,10,16 August 2009,"I thought Planet Terror was awesome and the better of the two Grindhouse movies! We first meet Cherry Darling doing a sexy go-go dance, but she wants to quit. During this time, some Military men are meeting at a Military base with a scientist named Abby. The Military need a huge amount of deadly biochemical agent called DC2. When the deal goes wrong, Abby shoots the DC2 and it all fills the night air and infects some of the town's residents. Then we meet Dr. Block and his wife, Dakota. They work the graveyard shift at the hospital. Meanwhile, Cherry runs into her old boyfriend, El Wray. During a ride in his truck, they run into some trouble with zombies! Cherry loses her leg, and Wray takes her to the hospital. At the hospital, the bodies keep rolling in, and the zombies take over. Cherry, Wray, Dakota, and the sheriff all meet at the sheriff's brother's BBQ place called The Bone Shack. They try to figure out how to survive the zombie outbreak, and get taken to the military base where the final battle between the living, and the dead plays out! There were a lot of awesome gore scenes! If you love zombies, and action, you'll love PLANET TERROR!!!",Planet Terror
70,gianmarcoronconi,Irriverent,8,25 July 2021,"Delirious, irreverent and funny film, not horror than from a reading of its own to zombies. The characters inside are often pushed to the height of dementia and many times you do not understand the connection between the various scenes of the edited, not to mention the scenes just nonsensical but they are very funny. In general the film has a huge amount of violence sometimes even unnecessary. According to me it's more a zombie comedy than a horror.",Planet Terror
71,hnt_dnl,Really just plain nasty!,2,8 September 2009,"I get what Robert Rodriguez was trying to accomplish with PLANET TERROR, a spoof of 60s-70s-80s zombie flicks, but I just didn't like it! Half of the GRINDHOUSE double-bill (Tarantino's DEATH PROOF was the other half), this half is actually has a slightly higher IMDb rating and more viewers seem to understand what Rodriguez was actually doing (most, including myself, don't understand what the hell Tarantino was thinking!).In terms of pacing, PLANET TERROR succeeds and it gets off to a promising start. The opening scene of the incredibly gorgeous Rose McGowan (who plays stripper-turned-stand-up-comic Cherry Darling) doing her act is fun and the flick does a least a good job of introducing all the main characters in the first 15 to 20 minutes or so. But then it is all downhill from there! My main problem with PLANET TERROR is how disgusting it is to watch, and not just the zombies! Most of the male characters are hard to look at! Watching extreme closeups of aging actors (Bruce Willis, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Jeff Fahey) and actors that plain just don't look good at any age (Naveen Andrews and Quentin Tarantino himself!) sweat, spit, and slobber is just not appealing to me! They don't look good BEFORE they become zombies! Then all the female characters strangely look PERFECT throughout the whole film! They don't sweat, barely bleed when shot, makeup stays in place in the midst of all the chaos. I know it's a parody/homage to zombie flicks, but also I expected a sense of ""reality"" in the way the characters looked in relation to what was happening to them. Really no different than your typical Hollywood film that ignores basic common sense things!The leads Rose McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez (in a deadpan performance as gun expert El Ray) are really good and they do a fine job rising above the rather sorry material they are given to work with. But overall, the acting is strangely bland, most of the actors all just enunciating the dialogue, as if they're trying to get through the script without dying of boredom! In particular, Marley Shelton (who plays Dr. Dakota Block and is the second female lead) is terribly bland and lifeless and acted like a zombie even though her character wasn't one! Again, I KNOW it's a parody of poorly acted and scripted zombie flicks, but PLANET TERROR comes off worse than those flicks it imitates and many of the lines are not funny. So really it is just a bad zombie flick itself and not even a decent parody. Rodriguez really went over the top here, but in the wrong way. The action is too sparse and pretty standard except of course for Cherry's machine gun leg, which is not all that impressive as it was advertised. The gore is more sickening than bloody. Did it really have to be THIS unwatchable?! Overly disgusting zombies, too many bland and boring characters, unfunny dialogue. Not my idea of a good time at the movies!",Planet Terror
72,drjgardner,You gotta be kidding,2,3 February 2020,What do you get when Bruce Willis is the best actor? when the guy who wrote it did just ab out everything else?

73,vip_ebriega,"""No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.""",10,24 April 2009,"My Take: The better half of GRINDHOUSE. Wildly over-the-top fun.See! An entire town invaded by blood-thirsty zombies spawned by a toxic gas outbreak. See! A band of freedom fighters shoot their way against the butt-ugly undead enemy and save the world. Scream! As butt-ugly zombies, hungering for human flesh, eat their way from one victim after another. Gasp! As those immune fight back against the undead threat. Gasp! As they find a formidable weapon: A woman with a machine gun for a leg. Gasp! As you see over-the-top violence and gore as you've never seen before. GRINDHOUSE Presents: PLANET TERROR! So creepy, so violent, so much fun, it'll eat you alive! Director Robert Rodriguez launches their GRINDHOUSE special with this wild, violent and highly entertaining take on the sleaziest B-horror movies and action exploitation flicks, thrown in with the sickest excesses that make it seem more like a big explosive blockbuster rather than the cheap, Z-grade sleaze-fest that inspired it. But why bother? PLANET TERROR is wildly excessive and wildly entertaining assault at the senses. There are moments that dare you to cover your eyes, and even moments that make you even reach for a barf bag, and let it be clear that I'm stating that as a compliment.Just to prove that the movie is an accurate take on Z-grade cheese, PLANET TERROR accurately opens in a night club, where the star of the show, Rose McGowan, does a pole dance routine. McGowan plays stripper/go-go dancer (there's a difference, actually!) Cheery Darling. Meanwhile, somewhere on the other side of town is an old military base where a black market dealer named Abernathy, Abby for short (Naveen Andrews) has a little disagreement with renegade military Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis!), which ends with a toxic bio-weapon which seeps into the unsuspecting town, turning hapless victims into blood-thirsty, butt-ugly zombies that makes snacks out of everyone. Only those immune including Cherry, her ex-boyfriend, one-man army El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), the stubborn sheriff (Michael Biehn), a steak house owner (Jeff Fahey), sexy anesthesiologist Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton), who is also threatened by her abusive, suspecting surgeon husband (Josh Brolin), and many other unsuspecting townsfolk can stave them off, get off town and possibly save the world.Rodriguez may have gone way too far when he fills every frame with every bit of excess his manic energy can think of, making it look more like an excessive Hollywood Blockbuster than the cheesy Z-grade cheapies that inspired it, but what PLANET TERROR maintains is its authenticity. The film is in the spirit of the movies it was inspired from that it inspires a sort of self-mockery. You know it's not meant to be taken seriously, even to be laughed at, yet you buy it at that level. It's obvious ridiculousness is part of the fun, and that's among the goals of the GRINDHOUSE experience. Another treat of the movie is its creative use of little known star Rose McGowan. McGowan is a real treat as the sly, sexy female lead, whether or not she has a machine gun for her leg or not. She's the real star here! Josh Brolin and Michael Biehn are welcome faces while Freddy Rodriguez makes an agreeable tough action hero. Though yet another Quentin Tarantino (extended) cameo is just unnecessary.Overall, PLANET TERROR is exhausting, but not in the bad way. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink that, when it's over, the movie would have given you your time and money's worth. It ain't for all tastes. Everyone else, such as myself, will have a good time in this pure amusement park attraction. Anyone expecting a movie that has boundaries won't have time to take a deep breath in PLANET TERROR. At least they might have time to clear their throat with Tarantino's DEATH PROOF.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Planet Terror
74,fmarkland32,Zombie Holocaust...,10,4 September 2010,"Survivors of a Texas town battle zombies who have breathed in a deadly toxic gas and as such have taken to killing everyone in their path, our defenders include a Machine gun legged go-go dancer (Rose McGowan), A military specialist who knows about such (Freddy Rodriguez), a sheriff (Michael Biehn) his brother who runs a Barbecue (Jeff Fahey),a bisexual nurse (Marley Shelton) and her sheriff father (Michael Parks) Planet Terror was the first part of the Grindhouse movie and easily the best movie of the duo. Planet Terror delivers not only as a zombie movie but also as an action movie and indeed as a tongue in cheek parody of such. Planet Terror does have it's minor flaws (Tarantino is really an awful actor, Bruce Willis is wasted) but overall the movie has lots of fun gory set-pieces, a quick pace and a sense of humor. It then makes a great double-bill with Sin City or Machete more so than Death Proof. If anything else this is a flop that deserves a second look. If anything, for the cast which make this a fun endeavor in old territory. Also the helicopter slicing climax is enough to make this a masterpiece in its own demented way.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",Planet Terror
75,one9eighty,Now THAT'S a rump roast.,7,18 February 2021,"This B-Movie horror-comedy film is part of the ""Grindhouse"" project that was supposed to be a collaboration between a handful of fun directors, including Tarantino, Eli Roth, Edgar Wright, and Rob Zombie. The original concept was a massive bumper film with lots of smaller segments allowing the different directors time to flex the directorial muscles in a 1960's and 1970's grind-house film style. As things developed, instead of one film, two films were birthed. ""Planet Terror"" which has a main story with other smaller segments mixed in, and Tarantino's stand-alone film of ""Death Proof"", which also has a segment in ""Planet Terror"" anyway.Residents in a rural sleepy part of Texas are about to face off against a nightmare horror which will test their skills of survival. In the process of securing a biochemical agent, Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) and his men encounter problems, and the chemical is accidentally released into the air, thus starting a zombie outbreak. The airborne chemical infects large parts of the local populous mutating people into deformed zombies. Meanwhile, Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) has quit her job as a go-go dancer, she bumps into her mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) and they plan to leave town. Dr Dakota Block (Marley Shelton) is about to leave town with her girlfriend Tammy (Stacy Ferguson), much to the anger of her husband, Dr William Block (Josh Brolin). But things seem to be going very very wrong from one turn to the next. Cherry loses a leg, El Wray is imprisoned, Mr and Mrs Block have a domestic, and the military are not much use at all. As the group of survivors come together the odds might be about to even out as Cherry gets a machine-gun leg, and El Wray's mysterious backstory is revealed - kind of.Inspired by grind-house movies of the past in style and feel, this film is made as a homage with the intention of looking bad and cheap. For that reason, you might think that it feels uneven or undeveloped in places. You will probably notice the change of film stock used to capture the footage. The intentional scratches and cigarette burn on the film, and of course the 'missing reel'. Rest assured these are all intentional, as intentional as the ludicrous story, the over-the-top action, stunts, and gore - but, let's be honest, if you know you are about to watch a film where a lead character gets a gun appendage to replace a zombie severed limb, you probably know that this isn't going to be ""Titanic"". While it may not be for everybody, I grew up watching what some people would call awful films, so for me, I enjoyed every bit of the tackiness.While ""Planet Terror"" is playing out you will see mismatched cuts which at times brings in other smaller segments that act as trailers for other films. ""Death Proof"" which Quentin Tarantino did as a solo movie anyway but appears as a trailer. ""Machete"" which also went on to be a standalone starring Danny Trejo and directed by Robert Rodriguez. ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", Rob Zombie's trailer with Nicholas Cage as Fun Manchu. ""Don't"" which sees Edgar Wright doing a Hammer House of Horror style trailer. ""Thanksgiving"" - Eli Roth's slasher film trailer contribution. And ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" by filmmakers Jason Eisener, John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, who won a competition to get their short included. Like ""Machete"", ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" went on to a feature film too with Rutger Hauer in the lead role.The acting is decent enough, but just as hammed up as the action unfolding on screen. There are times where the characters give a knowing nod and wink to the audience, but for the most part they seem to be playing it straight. Rose McGowan leads the line, although the supporting cast all do well enough, or as well as the silliness allows anyway.This tongue-in-cheek zombie gorefest is blood soaked and sexually suggestive. It has lots of carnage, violence, and bad language to help it forward. If you expected anything less, then you might need to brush up on what you expected from a film which celebrates the brutal sex-and-action exploitation films that grind-house style movies brought audiences.I wont lie, I loved this film. It might be ludicrous and bad-taste at times - but I'm a depraved film fan that grew up watching nasty and over-the-top horror films. This for pure enjoyment and fun, rather than for any important messages. Leave your brains at the door, get the snacks ready, and just kick back and enjoy.",Planet Terror
76,fwomp,"Blood, Gore, Sex ...What More Do You Need!",7,8 November 2007,"You've gotta love blood, gore, sex, lesbianism, and impossible human feats to enjoy something like PLANET TERROR. It is, in essence, a hardboiled 70s slasher/zombie film with all of its nonsensical sexual under (and over) tones surrounded by reel-to-reel style filming with its scratchy and skipping that those who've spent time at the drive-ins of ol' will no doubt enjoy as it hearkens them back to days gone by (gotta love that run-on sentence, eh?) Rose McGowan (DEATH PROOF) plays Cherry Darling (no, it's not a porn name ...although it could be), a strip dancer who's suddenly thrust into the middle of a pending apocalypse. The military has unleashed a zombifying chemical and it threatens Cherry's nearby one-horse town.She is quickly reunited with El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez, LADY IN THE WATER), a lost love turned truck driver who's never forgotten her. The two zip this way and that in an attempt to avoid the newly walking dead but Cherry meets up with a hungry bunch and has a lower leg gnawed off. She's taken to a local hospital where it rapidly becomes apparent that the zombies are taking over.Meanwhile, El Wray is taken into custody by Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) and there's an unmentioned tension between the two that escalates as the Sheriff's town begins falling apart. But the Sheriff knows how good El Wray is with a gun (""I never miss."") and eventually hands over his pistols to him. The ensuing head shots are gruesomely wonderful (I believe the handgun was a .45).Also amongst this chaos is the strained marriage of two physicians, Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin, THE DEAD GIRL) and Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton, DON'T COME KNOCKING) who work at this hospital where zombies begin increasing in numbers. William suspects his wife is having an affair and it is later confirmed; but it was with another woman, something that incenses him. Dakota is excellent at anesthetizing patients and her skills with her sexy syringe-stuffed garters comes in handy.The running gag throughout the film is a take on a barbecue restaurant which is besieged by the undead. It is run by Sheriff Hague's brother and the two are at odds over a secret sauce recipe. The brothers eventually come together in a very destructive way, but come together they must.In the end it is El Wray and Cherry who save the day. El Wray with his dead aim and Cherry with her newfound leggy weapon (gotta love the handicapped!) This will be a film of contention for many. For those who want a serious telling of a great zombie flick, they won't find it here. For those wanting a laugh-out-loud comedy in-line with such things as SHAUN OF THE DEAD, they won't find it either. But it is nicely wedged in-between those two, with some rousingly good gore and a few chuckles thrown in for good measure.A decent film for those that might enjoy a stroll down memory-film lane.(Note: This is part 2 of 2 in the Grindhouse film duet. The first movie, Death Proof, was directed by Quentin Tarantino and the two films were broken up upon DVD release. The two films come with an intermission that shows a few hilarious ""coming soon"" featurettes.)",Planet Terror

Regardless, i was still curious to watch both efforts, and the first of which I've had the chance to see is Planet Terror.It's simply about a small town that comes under attack from a virus which when it affects the town-folk makes everyone into zombie like creatures (e.g. attacking others to infect them also, appearances become inhuman etc etc). Add into this mix a Go-Go girl, her ex-boyfriend (an expert at gunslinging), a doctor with a cheating lesbian loving wife-cum-doctor and a bunch of others and you have your pulp fiction movie.Story wise its crazy but surprisingly its still quite fun. Dialogue isn't too bad, and is very entertaining. The film never really twists but plays along for the action as that's the main gist of the whole thing. Explosions, mass shootings, more explosions, zombie pulverising and even more shooting are the order of the day.Most importantly this has been filmed in the style of the old b-movies, with grainy pictures and a couple of homages to old b-movie filming (including a comical starting fake preview of a film called ""Machete"").Overall, I very much enjoyed it.

83,witster18,"a creepy, bloody mess of a good time...",8,22 October 2007,"Rodriguez's portion of Grindhouse is much bloodier and far more geared toward the horror genre fans than Tarantino's' Deathproof. I love the campy feel of Planet Terror. Some of the gore may be a little too distasteful for many. The fog, the flickers of the film stock...this one's definitely true to what they were going for... I thought Michael Beihn and Jeff Fahey's role's were a nice addition. While I loved the creepy air to this film, and the 'look' of this film,..it lacks much of the cohesiveness of 'Deathproof'. It may have been a bit too brisk with it's 87 min running time. I'm one of those wondering how this is rated higher than Tarantino's superior half of Grindhouse. Both films stand alone....but I can see how this tense, campy, horror flick out-shined it's more intricate follow-up. Planet Terror is a distasteful, creepy, in-your-face thriller straight out of the late 70's....Re-Animator Meets From Dusk Till Dawn... (EDIT)after a second vieweing this film has seriously grown on me....it's much funnier the second time around.....and now I 'get it' so to speak....I'm rating this the same as Deathproof at 8...but I still think QT's is a hair better.

84,Son_of_Mansfield,Project Gore.,7,26 October 2007,"Robert Rodriquez has always been a technological wonder and that is on display again in Planet Terror. There are some good classically styled zombie scenes including the Romero gut removal. There is also a jar of testicles, liquefied roadkill zombies, and a whole lotta puss. It's disgusting, but fun if you're up for that kind of thing.As is the norm with Rodriquez, there is little in the way of fun dialogue or interesting characters, although there is an improvement over his older films in that respect. The effort and care put into the aging effects is commendable and the cast, especially Freddy Rodriquez, Rose McGowan, and Jim Fahey are are up to the task. It's a movie that aspires to be a homage to old B movies and it succeeds.P.S. The mock trailer for Machete, staring Rodriquez fave Danny Trejo, is a goofy hoot about a betrayed Mexican, definitely a Mexi-can, who rallies his fellow countrymen to take on the man.

85,Superunknovvn,Fantastic Trash,7,27 October 2007,"If the real Grindhouse movies had kept what they promised on movie posters and in previews they would all have been as fantastically entertaining as ""Planet Terror"". Of course, Rodriguez movie had a much higher budget to work with than the B- and C-flicks from the 70's and you can see it. The make-up is hilariously over the top, but it still looks great, zombies are getting massacred left and right, things explode every two seconds - it's obvious that this is a big budget movie made to look like trash. Even the story doesn't seem as trashy as we're supposed to think it is, because you can see how much thought actually went into it. Supposedly it's also meant to be a tribute to John Carpenter's movies, which I can't understand at all. Carpenter's work was never as trashy as ""Planet Terror"" is (well, excluding maybe ""Escape From L.A."") and it has a completely different feel to it.Still, all of this doesn't take away from the fun of ""Planet Terror"". The ""Grindhouse""-feeling is just there to help us forget that we're not watching this to stimulate our intellect, but to have a jolly good time. And a jolly good time we have.The movie is filled with great one-liners and cool characters in true Tarantino/Rodriguez fashion. If there is one flaw, it's that there are too many characters and that, even though that is intentional, they're all just a bit too one-dimensional, leaving us with almost nothing to identify with. That keeps the whole movie strangely shallow. Fun but shallow.At the end of the day ""Planet Terror"" is the more entertaining out of the two ""Grindhouse"" films and it's also Robert Rodriguez' best movie so far. I can see why the two movies together flopped, though.

86,qormi,Planet Stupid,1,6 July 2009,"Okay, this film was supposed to be a parody, but even with that low standard, it could have been better. The whole bit about the machine gun attachment for the one-legged woman was extremely insulting to even the lowest level of intelligence. How could she possibly have pulled the trigger? How?? The thing with the jar of testicles - does this really pass for entertainment in western civilization? This film suffered because it was crude and pandered to the lowest of lowlifes. I'll admit that it had a better take on the ""living dead"" than most films of this genre. I have to go back to the machine-gun to leg attachment: it may have been the singularly most stupid thing I've seen outside of a Popeye cartoon. By the way, this woman had just gotten her leg amputated earlier in the evening. She sure recovers from surgery quickly - no pain meds, no post-op drowsiness from anesthesia....really stupid; too stupid to be a successful parody.",Planet Terror
87,ctomvelu-1,Living dead are back!,7,31 May 2008,"PLANET TERROR is a twist on LIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, as a terrible gas is released that turns its victims into snarling, ravenous zombies. Not much here to distinguish it from the films cited above, but Bruce Willis does a nice turn as a bad general and the gore quotient actually outdoes all previous American zombie movies. When people are shot in PT, blood pumps out of them like water shooting out of a firehose. And there's one very satisfying shot of a screaming man being torn into various segments by a host of zombies, done up in classic 1970s style. That scene may remind some of a similar scene in RE-ANIMATOR. Rose McGowan is a standout as a floozy who loses her leg to the zombies and finds new meaning in life with an assault rifle strapped to the stump.

88,dave13-1,great big dumb fun,8,13 April 2012,"The Rodriguez half of a double bill of 70s drive-in type movies, complete with scratches on the film, projector chatter and missing reels, but made with more style, better actors and most importantly more MONEY than was typical for the form. Both features dredge up familiar story concepts. This one deals with a virus that turns the locals in a small Texas town into zombie cannibals (shades of the much imitated Night of the Living Dead). Such movies are usually just barely watchable, even laughable thanks to amateurish scripting and acting and unspecial (cheap) effects. But here the material is made watchable by casting charismatic actors, especially Rose McGowan, in the main roles and by energizing the material with sharp dialog, wonderful stunting and some of the most up-close and gruesome splatter effects ever labeled 'not for the timid'. The result is exactly the sort of fun, clever and resonant movie-going experience that Rodriguez and Tarantino so clearly intended. The pace is so fast, the visuals are so absorbing, so graphic and seemingly real that - unlike so many of the old howlers this one imitates - the viewer is only reminded that a movie is going on when the film scratches or something.

89,rajdoctor,Planet Terror,2,18 August 2007,"I had high expectations from this movie, only because it was one of the movies of Grind-house and it was appreciated and rated high by many. I had also seen Death Proof  another Grind-house movie and had loved it.The basic premise is about a virus on the loose that makes people flesh eating creatures. It is spreading across the world and the only anti-dote is the people who have not got that virus, has to kill the people with virus. So a bunch of people who does not have the virus start killing people having this virus. There are several characters and plots in the movie, which I would not try to dwell into because it will unnecessary become complicated to explain.Depiction of this story-line could had been done in many ways, but the young Writer - Director Robert Rodriguez (Sin City fame) takes the loosest creative path  show as much blood, gory, dirty, unbelievable things, pieces of body, guts, everything you can imagine on the screen as you can  surprise the people with what they have not seen before. I am very sure in today's world there would be a great bunch of people who would stand up and applaud such disgusting things.For me the movie was totally crass  SENSELESS is the word. There was no meaning in what the director wants to do in the movie. The only saving grace in the movie was Rose McGowan as a one-legged lady. She leaves some impact on you with her beauty, charm and actions.Otherwise, a star-cast of Naveen Andrews, Bruce Willis (what he was doing here?) and Quentin Tarantino as a last minute rapist were total let-down.Not much to write about such a BAKWASS crap. I do not know where the world is going? What happened to creative directors? (Stars 2 out of 10)",Planet Terror

The performances are terrific and the action is non-stop, there's of course dark humor to propel the film especially nifty gore for the gore-hound in all of us such as the cringe inducing castration sequence, flesh-eating, exploding heads, brains exposed, slicing and dicing you name it. The ever gorgeous Rose Mcgowen as she does a great performance as one of the most unusual and most original silver screen heroines yet! i love how the film was filmed in the style of old 70's 16mm with some grains and a quick missing reel part.It's a far superior story in the ""Grindhouse"" double feature horror anthology then ""Death Proof"", it's just the right movie for anyone who's into horror, Sci-fi, comedy, gore and action.Also recommended: ""Re-Animator"", ""Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)"", ""Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)"", ""Day of the Dead"", ""Land of the Dead"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Cemetery Man"", ""Fido"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Nightmare City (a.k.a.

91,raypdaley182,Bad enough to be excellent,6,27 March 2008,"I'm not sure if this film is supposed to look old but I assume the poor looking ""film"" stock is deliberate. It's got a pretty impressive cast, Micheal Biehn (Terminator & Aliens), Tom Savini (several Romero films), Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews (Lost), Jeff Fahey (Lawnmower Man).Heck they even got Rose McGowen from Charmed and pop star Fergie.Now the action is good, its gory and it it makes no apologies either.I do have a question, is the guy that Tom Savini shoots in the hospital car park (when Biehn says ""Damn It!"") Comedian Billy Connelly in an uncredited cameo?Rose McGowen is pretty hard to take seriously in this. Even when she swears it's not very convincing, It's like she's saying those words for the first time. The gratuitous love scene is VERY badly placed and a really bad idea.The whole ""missing reel"" idea? Very stupid. A very lame way of getting around having to shoot action and not being able to afford it. Oh, and the guy playing El Wray? He should really play Max Payne if they do a movie of that. (He looks exactly right).Tom Savini gets a brilliant death (torn into big chunks!), and it's rather stupid that Rose can fire her gun leg without even touching a trigger? Naveen dies well (if rather pointlessly as he's the most important member of the group, the only one who can make a cure), and we get a pretty awful ending to a half decent picture that would have been a million times better without the stupid ""warping film/bad film stock"" effects which almost certainly cost a fortune and made the film look terrible, visually.",Planet Terror
92,LazySod,Good for a few laughs,7,29 October 2007,"When a biochemical weapon is released onto the world all Hell breaks loose. The end. Can't make any more of the story because that is all there is. But as this is a zombie hack/slash film it doesn't matter. It doesn't need more story. It needs blood. It needs brains. It needs severed limbs. And it features all that, in big enough quantities to work out rather well.It starts like just any typical zombie film: some event happens that turns otherwise healthy human beings into monstrosities that fill their days slaughtering everything they encounter and searching for fresh meat. And after those events happen it just keeps rolling. On and on like a tumble-weed in a fresh desert wind. Effects used are great, giving the film just the feeling it wants to express: a typical 1970s zombie film that doesn't have much to give but does give that what it does have in the right way.Just like Death Proof this one used various techniques to make the film look way older than it is, but unlike Death Proof this one doesn't rely on it and has quite a bit to offer without just the novelty of a new trick. Where DP was boring for the most of the film (I thought it actually had about only 20 minutes of good bits) this one is fun over the full length of it and the eye candy just adds to the effect of the film, making it worth the while and the money needed to get into the cinema.All in all, this makes for a good segment. Combining Death Proof and Planet Terror into Grindhouse then would give an average of 5 out of 10 for the both of them, but that really is too mild for DP and too harsh for PT so I'd rather keep them apart.7 out of 10 out of control mind eaters",Planet Terror

And i guess that no one apart from trash-horror aficionados would have heard about it hadn't it been the cast and more famous director involved in the double feature.Planet Terror offers a story or a rather a ""story"" typical for any similar feature film. There are monsters, someone is running away from them, then there was a lot of fighting and gore. And even this is too much of an explanation. You either like such movies or you don't.There are some known names in the cast and Tarantino got some screen time to satisfy his ego-tripping.",Planet Terror
94,FilmFlaneur,Better than Tarantino's half...,7,18 January 2008,"Rodriguez's half of the original 'grindhouse' double bill , which consisted of his TERROR PLANET with Tarantino's DEATH PROOF. Likely audience reactions led to the two titles being separated and issued apart. As a homage to the drive-in tradition and genres beloved by Tarantino et al, the two films are resolutely exploitative, but PLANET is the most overtly tongue in cheek, and the most enjoyable, being a good old shoot 'em up Zombie flic. Unlike SIN CITY which was inspired by good source work which led to it being rather self consciously 'cool', PLANET tries hard to mimic bad work that, by definition of its admirers is *unconsciously* cool. This reviewer at least found the results less pretentious, the trash origins not being made more of than they ever were - the sexist treatment of women for instance less insidious.The illusion of viewing much watched, much loved bad 70's junk cinema is extended even to the point of deliberately introducing blemishes to the film, also plot holes, as well as a whole 'missing reel' which interrupts the continuity, with suitable management apologies, half way through the action. Interestingly these artifacts on screen have a vivid presence, counterpointing key words and moments with an abstract, but deliberate commentary of colours, flares, clicks and splices that practically qualifies them as a 'character' in their own right. One especially relishes the colour balance slide to red as Tarantino (in a self-directed sequence playing a rapist) works his menace, or the apt film flare or burn outs during the erotic moments. Some great lines (e.g. Bruce Willis' opening words ""Where's the sh*t?"") and over the top gore add to a fun mix.Perhaps the only miscalulation is the length of the film; most cheap exploitation flicks struggled to reach the 80 min mark, which meant their weaknesses did not always outstay their welcome. Clocking in at almost 2 hours, PLANET TERROR forgets eventually that more of the 'bad' to the Nth degree is not always to the best, revealing the self indulgence common to some of the later works of the Rodriguez-Tarantino school, but this is a minor quibble and fans won't mind. Whether or not those unfamiliar with the original inspiration will get the joke for that long is a different matter, although an audio track which includes live audience reaction makes things easier. The DVD comes complete with a splendid fake trailer for MACHETE, a supposed Mexploitation revenge drama - which incidentally IMDb seems to think is actually slated for production next year!",Planet Terror
95,Al_The_Strange,"""It's go go, not cry cry.""",9,20 October 2013,"In 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez joined forces to create the Grindhouse film experience: a double feature intended to emulate the thrilling grittiness and distinctive roughness of 1970s exploitation cinema.Planet Terror is a sick, disgusting, schlocky, over-the-top and ridiculous zombie flick, and for a Grindhouse feature, it's perfect! This film revels in so much splattering blood and twisted mutilations; combined with the purposeful damaging of the film negatives, it makes for a very rough-looking picture. Combined with the fast-paced action and explosive mayhem, the whole film becomes a wild thrill ride.The story does its job well enough, presenting enough of a plot to allow the carnage to unfold and get the characters together to try and survive. In spite of that, the plot ties itself up pretty neatly. The characters are very colorful and distinctive, and they are a blast to watch. My only complaint is that a few characters act a little too mean, too unreasonably, or make decisions that have tragic outcomes. Still, the film rarely takes itself seriously, so these issues breeze by and hardly hinder the film's flow.This film uses pretty decent photography and good editing. The entire picture has been loaded up with film scratches, dirt, discolorations, and other effects to make it look old-fashioned and gritty; often times, these effects are cleverly inserted during key scenes to enhance specific scenes, and it's pretty neat that way. Acting is pretty decent from the whole cast, and the writing proves to be quite witty and fun. This production uses some very rough and gritty-looking sets, props, costumes, make-up effects, and special effects. Robert Rodriguez's music score is pretty damn awesome too.Of the Grindhouse double-feature, Planet Terror is my favorite of the lot, for it is so full of crazy energy, crazy blood and gore, crazy characters, and crazy style. The film is pure Robert Rodriguez, and I think it's perfect for the Grindhouse theme. If you can handle the extremities of the film, it's worth checking out at least once.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Good)",Planet Terror

Then watch Planet Terror (2007). I have seen a lot of zombie films and I would say that this is quite good. The biggest problem is that it tries too hard to be a trashy b-movie, the best trashy movies are low budget with lots of creativity.

Fun but would have been better if it was trashy and not imitation trashy.",Planet Terror
97,DavidSim240183,Looks like a no-brainer!,8,15 January 2009,"Planet Terror was one half of the ill-fated Grindhouse. A homage to splatter, exploitation cinema, co-filmed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino needs no introduction. He set the standard for modern noir and crime writing with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, considered by many to be Tarantino's masterpiece. Rodriguez is equally acclaimed. What with films like El Mariachi, Desperado and the superb Sin City, Robert Rodriguez is one of the great, multi-talented directors at work in Hollywood today.With their mutual love of gangster epics, its inevitable that Tarantino and Rodriguez would come together on some projects. They both worked on From Dusk Till Dawn, which could almost be a precursor to Planet Terror. And with Grindhouse, they each make a film of their own as a tribute to the Grindhouse shorts of old.But despite the hype, Grindhouse received a lukewarm response. Fans may not have known at the time that it was a double-bill, and when they walked out mid-section, they wound up missing an entire film altogether. I haven't seen Tarantino's Death Proof, but Planet Terror is a fine if inconsequential film from Rodriguez.When watched for the first time, you may ask what the film is all about. Characters often speak in shaded, anonymous terms, hinting at things we the audience aren't privy to. People start turning into zombies, intercut with Go-Go Dancer Rose McGowan pole-dancing, followed up with Jeff Fahey as a chef trying to perfect the BBQ sauce at his diner. These disconnected sequences make the film a real head-scratcher.Because Rodriguez has taken a leaf out of his own book. When he made From Dusk Till Dawn, that film started out like another one of his crime epics. In that case a kidnapping caper. But then about halfway through, he turned the story upside down and left it that way when it became a vampire picture. Some fans thought it a novel, inventive touch, but I found the effect far too confusing. Rodriguez never really found a way to make it work or play successfully. It was an interesting but ultimately flawed experiment. I had similar fears for Planet Terror.Happily Planet Terror does eventually make some sort of sense. Rodriguez has polished his act, and does manage to make this film work. He lets slip early on this is going to be a zombie picture, instead of just springing it on us like a pop-up effect in the way that scuppered From Dusk Till Dawn. But it may take a few viewings for you to realise it.Rodriguez has deliberately shot the film in grainy, blurred photography. To give it that genuine feel of a Grindhouse film. I'm not sure it was really all that necessary. Its more of a distraction. And takes much away from the slick kinesis of the action.One of the trademarks of Robert Rodriguez is the dizzying speed with which he keeps everything moving. When tied in to a strong script, his films can be extraordinary, like Sin City. Planet Terror is not one of the great films of Robert Rodriguez, but it delivers on what it promises. And its just as exciting as you'd expect of the man who made Desperado and Sin City.When the action kicks in and the characters band together, Planet Terror takes off. There's nothing profound about this picture. Its strictly generic. And the cast are a real bunch of B-grade stereotypes. But Rodriguez moves smoothly through the action. And the excellent cast he's brought together make the film so fun. Its all played for deliberate cheesiness. But it works. It never overbalances the film. It comes close at times. But much like Shoot em Up, the slick handling of the action and enthusiasm of the actors goes a long way towards saving the film from scraping the bottom of a discount bin.For all the headlining he gets, Bruce Willis is only in the film for all of ten minutes. But he does get a memorable death scene which is quite an effects tour-de-force. Its nice to see Michael Biehn back on our screens again. Even if he's only playing the part of a hard-nosed sheriff, he's having just as much fun as anyone else. And I liked Jeff Fahey's chef, more interested in perfecting recipes than zombie invasions. Fresh off the success of No Country For Old Men, Josh Brolin's creepy as anything as a psycho doctor with trust issues. And Marley Shelton adds some sweetness as Brolin's wife. A woman with a few skeletons in the closet (waiting to come out!).Rose McGowan holds the film together as the wonderfully feisty Cherry Darling. Always a greatly underrated actress, she sparkles in a role made for her flip wit and twinkly charm. An ex-stripper who's leg is eaten off by zombies, she has to have it replaced with a table leg, and then a machine-gun! She looks hysterical trying to walk in a straight line. Its her fierce determination that anchors the film. Without McGowan, Planet Terror wouldn't be half as good.The film never loses its sense of humour either. Many of the sight gags hit the mark. And Rodriguez winds them up so well they go from being merely funny to bloody hilarious! Like Marley Shelton trying to open a car door with paralysed hands while in the middle of a zombie attack. Or producing syringes stuffed away in her garter belt. The whole film is a fun-filled ride from start to finish.Planet Terror is no classic. It does perhaps feel like a step down for Rodriguez after Sin City. But I had a fun time. It gets the job done. And the action is fast and furious. Rodriguez has finally got the hang of special effects, and produces some superb (but gory!) ones. Highly recommended! But not to be watched on a full stomach!",Planet Terror

This movie takes zombies to a different level. The actors were great, Especially Freddy Rodriguez and Michael Biehn (whom I admire as an actor. And even my man Tom Savini was in this movie as the clumsy Deputy Tolo. He was sort of the comic relief I guess you could say. JT was a very likable character as well.

I'm not a fan of either director and I'm not entertained by seeing a bunch of big-chested, bodacious women bouncing around shooting people and spitting out ""hip"" dialogue. And, as was the point of Grindhouse, in this day and age I want my films to look like they were made with quality. I don't care if it's the point of the film and it's made to be a throwback to the pictures that the two director's loved; I don't want the films I watch to look terrible. So I clearly wasn't the demographic that the directors were going for and I'm perfectly fine with that. This all being said, the film is entertaining and that's all I was looking for going in. Most of the cast really captures the entire camp aspect of the film; Rose McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez are great (and the fact that Rose is particularly hot as hell doesn't hurt) but the real treat is Josh Brolin who perfectly captures the essence of it all. Bruce Willis is also a lot of fun in his brief appearance. The action is really badass and it's helped immensely by the insanely badass score.

I remember so clearly having the Grindhouse film poster up on the wall when I was around 15 and just loving the genre throwback that both directors were doing. It's so well executed with both and although Quentin's Death Proof is my favourite, Planet Terror is still a pretty good homage to splatter movies. It showcases a brilliant cast from McGowen to Marley Shelton as Dakota; Josh Brolin and Freddy Rodriguez as the badass El Wray! It even features very memorable cameos from Fergie as an unfortunate bystander, Bruce Willis as an infected solider and Tarantino as a repulsive abuser. The editing is spot on and relentlessly cool with all the blotches and flickers adding to the unique viewing experience; all the while holding impressive visual effects and amazing practical techniques. The style does occasionally clash with the characters who do have depth to them and are written with the intention of audiences empathy but it's hard to get engaged in them fully through the hyperactive visual sensibility.

Everything in Planet Terror from the film's main characters,Action,blood,gore and dialog go so over the top that you never know where the film is going to go and some of the situations that happen in the film are unpredictable and insane. What I also love about PT is the Humor in the film and I think the Humor in the film works because of the dialog and the way some of the characters are acting serious adding to the film's campy and over the top vibe. The Action in PT is great and amazing with shootouts and explosions that are straight of a comic book and match the energy and style of Robert Rodriguez's other movies and push the film to a higher level and with each Action scene you as a viewer you are thrilled and excited but as a viewer you can always expect the unexpected and there are always surprises and shocks. The blood and gore in PT is over the top and truly disgusting and not for the weak at heart when the blood and gore shows up it just comes off the screen like water and paint. I think the way that the blood and gore is used adds to the film's crazy energy. The main character Cherry Darling is such a great heroine because when you look at her in the very beginning of the film she's a Go-Go dancer who's sad and sympathetic but is also a tough Woman who can handle herself and when the Zombie outbreak happens she gets into Action kicking butt and taking names while at the same time getting a leg up(you'll see)on the Zombies and anyone else who messes with her. Cherry Darling is an amazing character you will remember and love after the film is over. What great about the Zombies in PT is that they aren't really Zombies in the traditional sense(the Zombies are called ""sickos"" in the movie)of the word because the Zombies are not dead people but people who go crazy when the toxic chemicals effect them and making the Sickos eat and kill people in a vicious and violent manner. When people are mutated and turn into sickos it's ugly and sick. The movie moves at a solid pace and never slows down bringing excitement and explosive intensity throughout the film and you as the viewer will barely have time to catch your breath or take a break. The screenplay by Robert Rodriguez is great and memorable with Rodriguez giving the main characters dialog that is amazing and very quotable and will stay with you after you watch. The ending or final 20-30 minutes of the film is brilliant and filled with great Action and thrills and will have you cheering at the screen. An amazing conclusion.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Rose McGowan is excellent and sexy as Cherry Darling,with McGowan bringing toughness,depth and greatness to the role. Freddy Rodriguez is brilliant as El Wray,a man of Action and Cherry's love interest. Josh Brolin is great and intense as Dr. William Block. Marley Shelton is fantastic and beautiful as Dr. Dakota Block,William Block's estranged wife. Jeff Fahey is wonderful and funny as J.T.,a cook that makes great Barburque. Michael Biehn is terrific as Sheriff Hague,J.T.'s brother. Bruce Willis is sensational as L.T Muldoon,a military man. Naveen Andrews is great as Abby,a scientist. Electra and Elise Avellan are fun and sexy as The Babysitter Twins. Quentin Tarantino is delightfully over the top as The Rapist. Michael Parks is wonderful once again as lawman Earl McGraw. Tom Savini is funny as Deputy Tolo,Hague's Deputy. Fergie does a good job as Tammy,Dakota's girlfriend. Nicky Katt(Joe),Julio Oscar Mechoso(Romy) and Rebel Rodriguez(Tony Block)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriguez is brilliant and stylish,with Rodriguez always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a great pace while also doing a great job with the Action scenes. Amazing job,Rodriguez.The score by Robert Rodriguez is fantastic and memorable using synthesizers and doing a score that's similar to the scores to John Carpenter's films and Horror films from the 1980s and the score fits well with the film. Wonderful score,Rodriguez.The special effects by K.N.B is amazing,bloody,gory and very realistic and add to the film. Great job,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Horror Films,Action Films,Zombie Films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Planet Terror,an excellent,Action-packed,bloody and gory over the top Zombie Horror film that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Planet Terror
107,freakfire-1,Nope to this one,2,27 August 2008,"I enjoyed the other Grindhouse movie that was released, but I did not go for this thing. Not only was it not fun, it wasn't even good action.Yes, the monster-like humans were supposed to be funny in a strange way. Instead, they hammed it up as much as they could just to get a few cheap laughs. I like cheap laughs, but this was corny.The M4 carbine rifle, somehow, acted like a second eye with razor sharp precision. Add to the corny deaths and the ""missing scene"" part of the movie and I was ready to stop there. But I watched until the bitter end with the corny ending.1 out of 2 films isn't bad I guess. better luck next time.",Planet Terror
108,TheMarwood,Rodriguez's best work,8,7 June 2014,"Robert Rodriguez's love of all things trash come together perfectly in Planet Terror. The film isn't simply tongue in cheek, there's real wit throughout. The atmosphere is so overly bathed in horror, that no matter how ridiculous the events get they seem to fit into this nightmare comedy with ease. It also helps that he gets some great work from his cast and a good enough performance from Rose McGowan who is a bit too self aware here. I actually prefer the longer version of the film, as apposed to the abridged version that played in Grindhouse - there's more humor and the characters are a bit more fleshed out. The gore is well done and mostly played for laughs and while the narrative is basically stitched together and light as a feather, Planet Terror is Rodriguez's best work.",Planet Terror
109,patches89,IM GONNA EAT YOUR BRAINS AND GAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE!!,7,21 February 2021,"The first half of the grindhouse double feature might be one of the best B-Movie and gory messes ive seen in some time. This is vintage Robert Rodriquez and very different from Sam Raimi's Evil Dead but it brought me similar entertainment as a group of people have to fight off a hord of zombies which include their friends and loved ones. This film shows that Bruce Willis and Josh Brolin were up for the fun and Rose McGowan was awesome as Cherry Darling though her infamous leg machine gun came way later than the film let on. Is it a good film? No, not in the sense of a straightforward film, however as a B movie it was fantastic",Planet Terror
110,ebossert,"This Is A Commercialistic Fluff Piece - Watch ""The Machine Girl"" (2008) Instead.",5,7 June 2008,"It's movies like this that have convinced me that American cinema is far from occupying the same entertainment value as other foreign industries. Anyone with any taste in film already knows that American art-house, horror, and romance movies suck to high heaven, leaving other countries to make virtually all significant contributions to those genres. I figured that if Hollywood can do anything well, it must be no-brain actioners. As luck would have it, I was in the mood for some over-the-top action/horror with a smoking hot stripper sporting a leg-cannon and blowing away dozens of baddies. ""Planet Terror"" looked to be the perfect film. There's only one little problem: All the good parts are in the trailer.That's not necessarily bad if you get a lot MORE of it when you actually see the movie, but in the case of ""Planet Terror"" there's almost nothing worth seeing outside of the trailer itself. For example, in the trailer you see Rose McGowan (with her machine gun) spin on the ground, jump high in the air, shoot a rocket, blow up a truck, and spin out of the way. The movie itself has those moments, but the only additional contribution McGowan has are a few extra sprays of bullets. That's it. With regards to everyone else, there's practically no action for the first 90 minutes of this movie. What little there is lasts for mere seconds. (The truck scene was decent and nicely gory though.) Near the end, we finally get to see Rose McGowan sport that machine gun, but the whole thing is over in 2 measly minutes.I'm still annoyed that the machine gun leg got so little screen time. The filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to create one of the most insane action scenes ever made. It's almost like they just got lazy and said, ""Let's film just enough to make the trailer look sweet."" In reality the finale is much too tame for its own good. And for goodness sakes, could you at least make it longer than 2 minutes! Listen, have someone with a brain coordinate an action scene and have Rose do all sorts of crazy stuff with her machine gun for about 6 minutes. Is that so difficult to understand? I'm personally perplexed at how they can screw this up. Somehow, they did.Bad acting, a poor screenplay, and undeveloped characters can be overlooked if there's enough wild action and horror to keep things moving. Such is not the case here. There's way too much time spent on stupidity and not enough time on the action and horror. There's one scene where a zombie walks up to a doctor, pops a big zit onto his face, then walks away. I'm sorry, but that's just really, really stupid. There's another scene where a woman breaks her wrist while attempting to open her car door. Again really, really stupid. Even when there's a good moment (like a wooden spike through the eye), it's followed by something lame (a penis melting onto the ground).Another big negative was the absence of a formidable antagonist. First they're fighting zombies, but that whole conflict is scrapped completely when they begin fighting some pseudo-mutant army dudes. The scriptwriter should have included some threatening bad guys, whether it be an increase in the number of zombies or perhaps a more intimidating mutant of some sort. The action is just too safe. The zombies (or army dudes) stand in the distance while the protagonists gun them down with heavy artillery. That's about it. A formidable antagonist would have made things much more interesting and exciting.In the end, you basically get a few minutes of juicy insanity that is smothered by 90+ minutes of mediocrity. There's simply no way this movie will satiate the needs of those with even a marginal experience watching foreign movies. I can't help but roll my eyes when I hear someone say, ""Man, Smoking Aces was crazy!"" or ""Planet Terror was nuts!"" when they refuse to watch foreign movies because they're too lazy to read subtitles. If they did watch some foreign titles, they'd notice that what Hollywood markets as extreme is really only playground material in countries like Japan. For example, the stripper assassin in ""Fudoh: The New Generation"" (1996) is so much more convincing than the one in ""Planet Terror"", and the gatling gun protagonist in ""The Machine Girl"" (2008) got to show her goods for a far longer period of time than Rose McGowan did in this movie, which is nothing more than a commercialistic fluff piece made to suit the masses who like everything safe and cozy while deluding themselves into thinking they're watching something ""crazy.""Don't even bother watching ""Planet Terror"" because you'll get more entertainment by watching the trailer over and over again. Better yet, go watch ""The Machine Girl."" It's twice as good and the trailer for that movie only represents the tip of the iceberg because there is a ton of bloodletting that you don't see in the preview. You'll get a lot more exposure to mind-numbing insanity that way. Go buy it ASAP!",Planet Terror
111,Jacques98,This is supposed to put me on the edge of my seat? It's just a movie full of talking scenes.,2,4 September 2008,"I've said it in every review I've written for all modern action movies I've seen: I'm tired of action movies trying to be a Lifetime TV drama with a few things blowing up more than an actual action movie. Planet Terror doesn't try to be a Lifetime TV drama as much as it tries to be weird black parody of normal life then have a few action sequences, and fails miserably. This is the only Robert Rodriguez movie I've even come close to enjoying, and as you can see, I still didn't enjoy it. I think this is simply because Robert Rodriguez has and always will put me to sleep with his boring Quentin Tarantino-wannabe style of directing. Will he ever get over himself? He's not Quentin Tarantino and he never will bewhy can't he please get his own voice? My main complaint with this movie is it lacks anything at all that is reminiscent of the action movie it tries to be. The majority of the film is talking scenes, with very little happening. How is this going to keep me on the edge of my seat? If I want to hear pointless talking, I'll go to the coffee shop and listen to some old man complain about his wifeand that is how this movie felt. Boring, pointless talking. As soon as you think some action is going to happen, some character spits off a 30-minute-long speech about his boring life. I actually timed the opening talking scene with Bruce Wills and it lasted 7 minutes before anyone even did so much as move a finger! And unlike the Quentin Tarantino film this tries to be, the talking scenes are all 100% worthless. Nothing has to do with the plot, and even the worthless talking scenes are poorly done and just as boring as that old man in the coffee shop. And this is supposed to be the kind of movie to grab your attention and not let go? The actual grindhouse style of the film was fairly well-done, but being someone who has watched actual grindhouse movies, I can tell you that Rodriguez's signature character style is as ridiculously out of place. The characters walk and talk like they're half-robots, awkwardly spouting repeated tidbits they've said fifteen times already. By the end of the movie you'll hear characters say the same things so many times you'll think it's all they know how to say. Beyond that, we get a glimpse at all of their boring lives. Oh, man, I'm on the edge of my seat now! I get to see some lady cook dinner instead of just hear her talk about it! There is not even a single action scene in the movie until a little after the halfway point, and the signature machine-gun-for-a-leg scene happens so late in the movieliterally in the last 25 minutesyou start to wonder if it was just a sales gimmick. When the action happens, it is pretty solid, but it's so broken by more pointless talking scenes there isn't a single point where it's actually even borderline intense. As far as the blood goes, it's nothing special, it's just about the same generic amount you've seen in every zombie movie ever, and I was watching the unrated edition. This is by no means the bloodiest movie ever made, or even close. Compared to the 80's movie The Evil Dead, it's hard for me to even say this nearly 30 year processor has made zombie movies any bloodier than the first non-Romero entries in the sub-genre.This movie would have been so amazing if it just would have focused on the action and not the forgettable talking scenes. But, nope, Rodriguez is just as typical as all the other Quentin Tarantino-wannabes: he thinks he can write talking scenes that aren't boring, and he's going to force us to sit through them until he realizes he can't. Hopefully by then an action movie will remember that we came for the action and not the hour and a half of pointless talking fillers and daily life tasks.3/10",Planet Terror
112,Quebec_Dragon,More entertaining than terrorizing,8,10 January 2010,"This was the first film in a double-feature homage to exploitation films of the seventies called Grindhouse. The second was Death Proof by Tarantino. Planet Terror was a much superior film in every aspect for me. It's jam-packed with well-done action and pyrotechnics. It's really fun and funny. It has great memorable characters. Yes it's a b-movie but it's one made with love and respect. Gross-out moments abound but beyond being disgusting and gory (which they are very much), they're usually quite amusing. It's an interesting paradox.There are several small ingenious touches that make you feel as if you're really watching an old cheaply made movie in a cheap theater such as the scratchy and/or distorted pictures, the fake trailers and the public service announcements. There are a few uncredited cameos from famous people playing roles that will delight you. The acting overall is just in the right tone and spirit. The music, and especially the main theme, are perfect. Planet Terror despite its grandiose title is not a sci-fi flick, it's a zombie horror film taking place in a small southern us region. It's both inventive and a throw-back. It's likely you'll have a great time watching it provided you're not squeamish. Bravo for this successful experiment, at least for director Rodriguez's part.Rating: 8 out of 10",Planet Terror

114,galileo3,Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' is a failure even in B movie terms...,2,6 August 2009,"Planet Terror (2007)The first part of the B movie double feature 'Grindhouse' by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is intended to be something like a 1960s -70s B-movie, where the golden era of exploitation movie sprung such notable examples as George A Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' and Joe Dante's ridiculous 'Piranha'.At 191 minutes of sleazy, gory, mouthy, gratuitous content whizzing around it is no surprise that 'Grindhouse' flopped at the box-office, which forced the studio to split the films separately to raise more revenue for outside the USA. In some ways, for a select audiences, 'Grindhouse' can be a satisfying experience (not for me); however for the largely vacuous and linear average modern cinema goer, who pays his $10 or £10 for a film, he expects a simple story, some action and a nice wrapped up ending. Planet Terror + Death Proof suffered because they are films that belong in a long gone era. Cinema's stagnant and uninspired state is heading to a dangerous direction of SFX/ CGI and explosions - at least it is good that we have such eminent directors such as Quentin Tarantino refusing to succumb to the notion that film is for big bucks and big sequences.Anyhow, back to Planet Terror - the film is not as exciting or fun as you may expect. It starts out quite interestingly but the zombie and gore concept wears thin early and you are left bored and drained for about 75 minutes of the film; same old, same old. This isn't a good film by any standards.2/10",Planet Terror

In most of Robert Rodriguez's films there is a lot of good action, but this film beats them all. It's also the second bloodiest film I've ever seen, the first one would be Kill Bill but I'm not sure which one was bloodier because there is tons of blood in this film, maybe it's even bloodier than Kill Bill.

117,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Planet Terror (2007),7,26 March 2008,A must see if you have seen Death Proof. This is a classic zombie movie from the 70's with a modern look at it. If you like zombie movies then it is worth a look.My problem with this was the way they made it look old. In Death Proof it was great and worked. But in this they overdo it. There is massive lines through the movie and there are massive burns in the film. Very overdone.Of course this being a zombie movie there is blood and gore. But i found that it had much more blood then in other zombie movies.The acting was good and the characters were good but how the story unfolded felt a little bit silly to me. It just seemed way to Resident Evil.It was good. I would rather Death Proof. I recommend.7/10,Planet Terror

And when the second part arrives, you are literally left wanting more and more. Okay, maybe their not both classics but hell worth watching. The layout and density of both character and plot are highly pointed out. The choreography of the setting and vastness of the film is also compelling i.e. the green hovering mist, the moon and mythic darkness the film takes place. As for the violence and gore, it couldn't of been achieved or perspective in any other form than of Robert Rodriguez's.

119,rhinocerosfive-1,"""I did mean to hurt you.""",8,28 October 2007,"A nearly perfect good time, marred only by the acting of Quentin Tarantino and the absence of nudity.The real perversion of somebody like Robert Rodriguez is the puritanical streak running through his hyper-violent resume. He likes family and kids, which is admirable, and as kids' movies go, the ""Spy"" flicks are better than most. But his foul-mouthed adult shoot-em-ups, especially the ones with the visual gimmicks, break the laws of their own universe when they overdeliver the sadism and often fail to pay off on the skin side. If you're a grindhouse director, grind some ass, baby. (Although he did, once upon a time, give us a whole lot of Salma Hayek.)That said, this movie is excellent on just about every level. The funky look makes watching fun, and adds to the thrill without distracting. It's very funny, and hardly ever seems like it's trying. The missing reel is inspired. A zombie movie is about the played-outest thing going, so it's gotta happen fast and large. The action here is as big as it needs to be. Shocks keep coming, characters are interesting, and other than nipples or pubic hair, anything could happen.Any excuse to hear Michael Parks speak is a good excuse.

122,lotus_chief,"Absurdly entertaining, very well executed.",8,18 November 2007,"No need for a long, drawn-out review. Planet Terror is plain ol' B-movie fun! Everyone does their job well here. Acting, directing and overall execution was first class. It was nice to see Freddy Rodriguez play the ultimate bad ass...he was very good. Rose McGowan was good as well. Jeff Fahey was great, nice to see Michael Biehn again and Josh Brolin was as creepy as ever. An absurd, hilarious, over-the-top zombie movie thats so bad, its good....just like the good ol' days. Rodriguez has done it again.I can fully appreciate Rodriguez paying homage to the B-movie, exploitation films of the 60s and 70s. Didn't mind the buckets of blood splattered out with every gunshot wound. The 'missing reel' was a WONDERFUL touch, absolutely hilarious. The fake 'Machete' trailer is an absolute classic....can't wait for the finished product due out next year. The grainy film was great. I don't care to know just how Cherry was able to fire the machine gun invention made for her by El Wray, don't even care to know why the scientist was so obsessed with walking around with men's balls. Planet Terror is the model case of a movie that knows just what it is; therefore it doesn't take itself seriously and grabs a hold of you and takes you on a wild ride with no intention of letting go. If you go into Planet Terror accepting it for what it is and what its trying to accomplish, you can't help but enjoy it. And I, for one, loved it. Kudos to Rodriguez, his Grindhouse effort is MILES ahead of Tarantino's mess (Death Proof); Planet Terror is the better film hands-down in every aspect: execution, entertainment, and flat out good movie-making. Thankfully they split the two films, if you had to choose one, this is the obvious choice. Highly recommended.8/10",Planet Terror

Rodrigues, on the other hand, has served up a shock-shlock film that's just pure, unadulterated Fun! The cast hams it up in old-fashioned style, Bruce Willis has tremendous fun with his role and two 'Lost' stalwarts, Naveen Andrews and Jeff Fahey relish their parts and put in good, satisfying performances. Freddy Rodriguez and Rose McGowan shine in the leads and Josh Brolin makes a scary villain! It IS violent, but then it's not meant for kiddies or those of a sensitive nature.

It is sort of a homage to grindhouse films that were once popular in America. Those were low-budget exploitation films, where the latter indicates an action with unsparing utilization of violence, gore and carnage. In this one, a gas leak causes some people to turn into zombies, hence a violent struggle emerges between zombies and humans. It is not to your taste, if you are looking for a regular plot with well-developed characters.

125,mirwais-orbit,B-Rodriguez-movie,8,4 May 2009,"The ""Grindhouse"" project for sure was a huge thing and also a very over-self-confident thing by friends-forever Tarantino & Rodriguez. By the grand idea that Grindhouse would be a huge box office hit or a huge home video hit, they failed so dam good that in Brazil, for example, Grindhouse has been split and Death Proof segment never came out not even in home video. So... there's a leg missing here. Tarantino & Rodriguez believed so much in the power of their names that both of them sure are thinking right now if they still rule Hollywood as they did once.I have to say that I really don't like so much this kind of ""group thing"" in movies. I mean... friends doing movies for and with friends like both Rodriguez & Tarantino with Grindhouse or Sin City, or Sodenbergh with his bunch of folks in the Ocean's Trilogy. I used to like once, but not anymore for one good reason: I hate those inner jokes. Those ones that you never laugh because they were not meant to do that FOR YOU, but only for them. So that's why I'm a lot late with this one, because I can't stand that in movies... and I was wrong about it. Of course there are times that were meant to be just for their own entertaining, but the movie itself is a lot entertaining for the outsiders.Planet Terror is a great movie alone, mainly because it's Rodriguez doing his best: intentional B-movies as From Dusk Till Down (1996). It's frightening, disgusting, with a great disturbing sound and also plenty of dark humor in the right moments. Entire movie drinks from references in horror and zombie movies, from Romero's Dead Trilogy to The Return Of The Living Dead and also to 28 Days Later. There are so many references here and sometimes they are just shameless copycats. Great experience would be watching it in theaters because during entire movie there are all those aging filters with film burnings and saturated colors together with scratches and image noising, things that would look pretty realistic in a theater but in home video is just annoying some times. Also I think that if I had to watch it in theaters together with Death Proof or vice-versa, I would not stand. The movie is quite long for a segment and there're times that you just want to use the skip button.It's a trash movie with no reasons but for sure is the best thing I've seen from Rodriguez since ""From Dusk Till Down"".",Planet Terror

127,CrassActionHero,Rodriguez Pays Tribute. A Fine Tribute Indeed,8,3 November 2007,"Planet Terror (2007) Review: Planet Terror is the First of the Grindhouse. I save the best for last.Planet Terror is all about fun. This is a fitting tribute to the schlock value and the zombie genre. Not only that but Rodriguez actually redefines the zombie genre. This starts off with a awesome mock trailer of ""Machete"". A hoot all the way. Then the movie begins.The music is the first thing I notice and it is perfect for Planet Terror. It's stylish and cool to listen to. Planet Terror actually has a good story and plot to it. We get a excellent talent pool to swim in. All the characters are quite likable especially J.T.(Best in Texas)Rodriguez bring on the buckets of blood and then some more with some witty humor and Planet Terror is not afraid to make fun of themselves in the process. The movie has an age feel to it. Rodriguez has done a masterful job of adding the age to the film to bring back the ""Grindhouse"" feeling. The action is tight, the zombies are disgusting, and the humor is cheap and to the point. The only thing missing to fully tribute to the olé B-movies is the nudity. O well, beggars can't be choosers.With Bruce Willis, Micheal Biehn, and a very memorable performance from Josh Brolin, you cannot go wrong. It's a shame that this did not bold too well in the theaters. I had lots of fun while watching this is the theater.

128,Ozzy2000,Very Sophisticated,10,13 March 2008,"Another family grind-house movie written and directed by the great Robert Rodriguez. Its really intense action packed Zombie movie. Infection and its spread are by the usual intimate means. Special appearance by the Great Bruce Willis as one of the infected military zombies. Rose Mcgowan plays Cherry who quickly recovers from having her leg ripped off by Zombies and it is eventually replaced with a fully automatic machine gun , grenade launcher. as with Tarantino films there is a bunch of burnt out actors who get resurrected to play either zombies or the town folk who are fighting them. Ridriguez brings that magic Hispanic touch to his films and Tarantino adds the stylistic magic. There are tribute references to ""The Thing"" and many other films and like ""Death Proof"" its so one dimensionally gross its great. The effects are great and Zombie/slasher come Gore Fans will be greatly satisfied.",Planet Terror
129,Dragoneyed363,The better half of Grindhouse,10,28 March 2008,"WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.I must tell all, that in my honest opinion, Planet Terror is one astonishingly magnificent masterpiece. It was wonderfully exciting and filled with great action parts, hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, and non-stop entertainment. Next to it's sibling, Death Proof, there's no doubt that Planet Terror is the better of the two. Death Proof was great, don't get me wrong, but as for Planet Terror, it was flawless. There's just more exciting, fun, and catchy scenes and lines in Planet Terror than Death Proof, like when Cherry gets a table leg as a leg to walk on and is stumbling out of the hospital, and later in the car uses the line, ""It's splintering"", and when she gets her machine gun leg and blasts her way through endless zombies with kick-ass maneuvers. They even manage to bring out a bit of sorrow when Cherry's lover Ray dies, which is hard to find in a movie of this genre. Regardless of which flick you think is better, if you have seen both features of Grindhouse, you must admit that Planet Terror had better action than Death Proof and that the performances were so just a bit more enjoyable, at least, I certainly thought so.In my honest opinion, this feature is a wonderful movie that could attract just as more attention off by itself than if it was shown in theaters next to Death Proof, which, it was. Planet Terror was spectacular, and I tell this to everyone, if you aren't into great scenes of gore, non-stop action and suspense, and horror/comedy dialogue, you just don't know what you are missing out on if you don't love Planet Terror, especially if you didn't find yourself laughing or being mesmerized at any scene in said film.",Planet Terror
130,billion_mucks,A Youngster with a Camera,1,29 January 2008,"I've seen Rodriguez, I liked the Mariachi series not for its intelligence but for it's thrilling action. I knew that in collaboration with Quentin, both with souls of teens would shed a river-course of blood unnecessary into the movie as a ""spoof"", ""homage"" whatever to 60, 70 movies.But blood is the main problem: Rodriguez and Tarantino do not refine their method in showing awful things but twist it. I can handle senseless blood, but there is a loud excess, too much parts with the male intimacy being either melted, destroyed, mutilated (which talks about their repressed psyche) and one hour of true amateur work. Rodriguez doesn't want to construct interesting, mysterious (loveable?) characters, neither a good atmosphere. You know, a zombie environment can be pretty fun, if you show something more than them eating bones and vomiting blood.Rodriguez shatters any hint of tension just to show blood on blood- It's the only thing he can do, handling a weird, bizarre and disgusting aesthetics.Bye Rodriguez, bye Tarantino. I won't miss you. I'll keep ""Pulp Fiction"" as a good memory of us.",Planet Terror
131,Bob_the_Hobo,"When you get down to it, this isn't a good movie",3,5 May 2010,"Okay, I got the idea. 'Make a Grind-y, messy, crazy movie that will be an homage to the bad films we saw as kids.' Not a bad idea either. And it worked out quite well for Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's side of the project. But Planet Terror...is just not a good movie.First, let's look behind the 'beauty spots' and the lines running parallel to each other on the screen. When we do this we notice that we've seen this plot before; ""Ragtag survivors uncover sinister secret behind a zombie invasion."" JUST LIKE EVERY STRAIGHT TO DVD ZOMBIE FLICK I'VE EVER SEEN.This means it's a standard B-movie. So, Robert Rodriguez spent millions on a crappy B-movie, writing a script minus a plot, minus character development...I just didn't understand, who thought that this would be a good idea? The characters are unoriginal and boring. R.R. saw a badass in El Wray, I found him annoying. I started laughing uncontrollably when he was flipping those guns in the diner, how unimaginably cliché. Also, what was Bruce Willis doing in this movie? It's like they had finished the movie, then Bruce Willis called and said he wanted to be in it, and they added some random, meaningless scenes with him in a cameo. Willis is a sight for sore eyes here, but I didn't get why he needed to be there.The only sympathetic characters are from Rose McGowans 'Cherry Darling', a beautiful Go-go dancer who straps that gun to her leg. That was original, and probably the best part of the movie. Also we have Michael Biehn and Jeff Fahey, who have never played a bad role in their lives, now as a pair of brothers. Finally a very cool Tom Savini is killed in a reference to his ..Of The Dead series work.This isn't a bad film, it's just not a good one, and from the director of Sin City I expect a good movie. If Rodriguez wants to go crazy horror again, hopefully he'll look to his classic From Dusk Til Dawn for inspiration.",Planet Terror
132,RCWjr,Captured the spirit of Grind House better than Death Proof,8,10 June 2008,"To review this film and Death Proof separately is a disservice to the whole concept that they were released under. But seeing as I am a late viewer to these films, I have had to see them one at a time so I will review them separately, yet compare them.Rodriguez, in my opinion, made the better homage to the Grindhouse films. There was way over the top action, insane graphic violence and blood. Not one ugly woman in the whole movie and to boot, the sound sync is off. Coupled with a consistent worn look to the film, it just comes off more like the films I remember seeing in the late 70's that these films are patterned on.The action is funky and fun as well as brutal. Just what I remember from those original Grindhouse films of the 70's. There is not a throw away female in the cast. All are great actresses, but also have T&A to make you fawn while whooping it up for all the blood, guts and action.Too bad Tarantino tried to make a ""real"" movie and messed up this double bill. I would have rather seen Rodriquez make both movies, with some guesting by Tarantino (like in Sin City).Good stuff.",Planet Terror
133,80sHorror,Welcome to the Grindhouse!!!,10,3 March 2012,"I thought Planet Terror was awesome and the better of the two Grindhouse movies! We first meet Cherry Darling doing a sexy go-go dance, but she wants to quit. During this time, some Military men are meeting at a Military base with a scientist named Abby. The Military need a huge amount of deadly biochemical agent called DC2. When the deal goes wrong, Abby shoots the DC2 and it all fills the night air and infects some of the town's residents. Then we meet Dr. Block and his wife, Dakota. They work the graveyard shift at the hospital. Meanwhile, Cherry runs into her old boyfriend, El Wray. During a ride in his truck, they run into some trouble with zombies! Cherry loses her leg, and Wray takes her to the hospital. At the hospital, the bodies keep rolling in, and the zombies take over. Cherry, Wray, Dakota, and the sheriff all meet at the sheriff's brother's BBQ place called The Bone Shack. They try to figure out how to survive the zombie outbreak, and get taken to the military base where the final battle between the living, and the dead plays out! There were a lot of awesome gore scenes! If you love zombies, and action, you'll love PLANET TERROR!!!",Planet Terror
134,MattBirk,One of the most entertaining zombie movies of all time,8,9 July 2015,"Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror is by far the better of the two films (Death Proof being the other) that come together to create Grindhouse. This is one of the more darkly comedic and stylized, zombie survival movies out there, clearly a homage to all those old B-movies from back in the day. From the 'missing reel' gags to the choppy editing, the movie is flat out brilliant. Rodriguez did his homework on the genre and created a fantastic genre piece that is destined to find a solid cult following.Each character here gets their own story, some being more serious and others being quite humorous, but they all come together to create a bizarre story. Everyone in the movie seems to have a hidden agenda or some sort of cryptic undertone that carries over throughout the entire movie. That's what makes each story entertaining, you never know what the characters are capable of, especially during a zombie outbreak. But what really made the movie special was the aesthetics used in the movie to give it some visual flair, these days zombie movies are so common that they lack any originality, at least here they took a gamble and in my eyes, it paid off. You couldn't ask for a movie where the people behind the camera are having just as much fun as those in front of the camera. This is a movie you have to experience.In the end, this movie demands an acquired taste (horror aficionados and zombie lovers), others might not appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish. Planet Terror, along with Death Proof was a huge gamble on behalf of everyone involved behind the camera, and I'd have to say it was halfway successful.....this movie being the successful half.",Planet Terror
135,jamhorner,One Great Zombie Homage....on the Planet!,8,28 December 2007,"Knowing how wacky and loony Robert Rodriguez can get, I'm not surprised that he wrote and directed this lovely piece of zombie film. In fact, I'll go further and say that this is probably one the best zombie homage that I have ever seen, with the exceptions of the classics. The tale is quit simple and ""the usual,"" accidental bio-chemicals, or in this case gas, is accidentally released and the people who are exposed to it turn into ""sickos,"" and its up to a group of strangers and enemies to band together and fight there way through it. What I like about this movie is some of the most gross, gory and action packed randomness that is used to heighten the action of this film. The acting is pretty good, there aren't scares as much as it is gross and disturbing and the pinch of silliness that Rodriguez adds to his films. I think we all know what that is, Once Upon A Time in Mexico fans.To get started, there is a lot of randomness in this movie that overlaps all the categories that make this film worth watching. However, I think that the best random scene in this movie is the point were they are all in the bar and tension rises between two enemies and the film cuts out and the real is lost, then the real is found and put back together and everybody is friendly and the whole bar is burning. What the heck! I love that they added in that extra Grindhouse feel to it. Randomness like the iconic ""leg gun"" was handled quit well or the helicopter scene. But the randomness is also accompanied with silliness. The humor in this film is greatly exaggerated and well done, and for the most part, this aspect lightens up the scariness this movie may or may not have. A great example of humor is when everybody is riding around in jeeps and pickup trucks and the main character is riding on a moped. The humor is great but it can steer away from the film, many of the people in the audience were laughing rather than jumping, but I guess that is Robert's intention.The acting, to say the least was pretty good, not the best, but pretty well. I enjoyed the performance by Freddy Rodriguez, especially in the hospital when he goes ninja on the zombies. I enjoyed the vixen/dominatrix style that Rose McGowan brought to Cherry Darling's character. I really enjoyed the subtle, quite and evil charismatic character of Dr. William Block, as well as Josh Brolin who played him. It seems as though that Bruce Willis is there just to be there, and just to be a famous face, and he is, but in this film he plays a great part and his performance is vastly different from his other heroic side of acting. I loved the insane acting of Naveen Andrews and his sick obsession as well as Michael Biehn, who I'm glad is finally getting the limelight again. I haven't seen him since The Terminator. I was also quite fond of Tom Savini and Michael Parks as Earl McGraw.As I said before, there aren't many ""jump out"" scares as there were ""gross"" scares, and that works pretty well in this film, especially given the genre and plot. In this film there are zombies but they are more than just zombies, they are horribly mutated zombies. The reason why this film seems so original to the zombie genre is because dead in this film have large welts, tumors, cysts and puss pockets that gradually grow in size for time. Soon, they end up looking like someone with Proteus Syndrome. I also enjoyed the excessive gore that was used in this film, people being torn apart, zombies eating brains, the most disgusting tongue horror that I have ever seen. The gore is very, very excessive in this film and a bit too over the top; however, it just wouldn't be Planet Terror without it.I do want to add my 2 cents in about the action. To start off, I think that the leg-machine-gun will go down in cinematic history, as the most ridiculous form of action ever imaginable. In fact, this whole movie has its share of random action and ridiculous amount of explosive comedy. Examples from the trailer are using a helicopter to chop the heads off of zombies (Dawn of the Dead?), using the rocket-launcher-leg to propel oneself into the air, using a pocket rocket to shoot zombies, it's all great action-packed fun. I personally think that it ranks up with the Looney Toons style of action like Hot Fuzz and Shoot'em Up.Overall, I think this movie is a good natured, ol' fashion zombie flick with a few Rodriguez twists and turns to it. It has pretty good acting, great gory action and ridiculous amount of randomness and zombie carnage. Hopefully this zombie flick will go down in history as one of the best dead rising homage to the genre. This movie is just plain great! I would strongly recommend it for those horror fans that enjoy films like Slither or any kind of Troma based film. This film has that touch to it. I would also recommend this movie to those who enjoy zombie flicks as well as Romero flicks, I would go as far to recommend this one to black comedy fans and of course, Rodriguez fans. It's just a great action packed comedy-horror film that really ignites any television or theater screen.",Planet Terror

137,simonparker1990,Go-go and see it,10,14 November 2007,"The story of Grindhouse is a very sad one, a hyped up movie that barely anybody went to see resulting in it flopping in the US. Because of it flopping this meant that the two movies were split up and released individually throughout Europe, then the big blow came when Death Proof flopped almost as badly and so caused the number of screens for Planet Terror to be reduced, and then the poor movie never even entered the top 10 charts! I am one of the few in England that got to see Grindhouse in its original glory, although only through the internet and a DVD I shouldn't have. So as today is my birthday, and I had nothing better to do, I dragged a friend with me to my local cinema and sat and watched Planet Terror in its big screen glory, and I loved every minute of it. Planet Terror is a movie that has to be seen on the big screen, that's part of the fun of it, another part of the fun would be seeing it with a large audience and not just the three other people who were in my cinema. The brilliant soundtrack,, the stupidly over the top violence, the hilarious dialogue and stereotyped characters all make the movie just a joy to watch. In fact had Shoot Em Up not been made this year then Planet Terror would easily win title of stupid movie of the year. What is apparent however is how Planet Terror is not a movie for mainstream audience. The friend I dragged to see this with me sat there for just under two hours looking confused as hell, the second the machine gun leg appeared she just looked completely shocked. Still I personally adored the movie and for people who liked their movies stupid as hell they will too enjoy the movie very much.Rose McGowan is definitely the best cast member in my eyes in the movie. She is the character who has appeared on all the posters sporting her machine gun leg, and that undoubtedly is why she will be remembered. But her performance caught me off guard as she is actually a very witty and yet sympathetic character and Rose McGowan plays her exceptionally well. Her opening dance sequence is more than enough to keep all male audience interested, but the acting works as well. Freddie Rodriguez delivers a decent enough performance, he just has to look cool essentially and kill zombies. He does the role very well and does have seem pretty funny moments as well, his relationship with Cherry also works very well. Josh Brolin is just brilliant as Doc Block, a character so evil I'd quite happily see him show up in other movies directed by Rodriguez. His wife, played by Marley Shelton is equally as good, and the pair share one of the best scenes of the movie together, namely a scene where Block uses his wife's ""little friends"", its a surprisingly tense sequence and very well acted. Bruce Willis shows up in a decent enough cameo, sure he's pretty pointless in the movie but its nice to see a famous face. Alao special note has to go to Lost's Naveen Andrews, who shows he can actually deliver a pretty chilling performance when he wants to.So what of the storyline and violence of Planet Terror? Well when the movie was first released it was noted how violent it was. In my eyes I didn't find it that violent, there is one moment that churned my stomach a little bit, the sequence involving Tarantino, but generally the violence is so over the top it makes you laugh rather than cringe. Though if you can't handle your gore and found Hannibal way too much, then do not sit and watch Planet Terror, you must just pass out. The storyline of the movie is admittedly pretty poor, but that's the fun of the movie. Like Snakes on a Plane and Shoot Em' Up before it, the movie realised that it is just completely ridiculous. And if you can understand that fact then you can find much to enjoy in the movie. There are flaws to be found however, the film does seem just that bit too long and despite many fans adoring JT's storyline, it just made the movie that bit too long and wouldn't have minded if it had been cut. But whenever the gore factor is high or the dialogue is witty then Planet Terror is a movie to relish in.Planet Terror might not be Rodriguez's best movie, I still believe Sin City is a lot better than this, it is still a movie that deserves to be watched. Its a shame that Grindhouse was scrapped from Europe, the movie still works better alongside Death Proof, but watching it individually is still a good experience and the fact that the Machete trailer appears before hand is always a nice touch. So if you like your movies stupid and sick then Planet Terror is definitely a movie you should go watch on the cinema.",Planet Terror
138,MairegChernet,This is what a zombie movie is all about.,7,25 July 2008,"Rodriguez and Tarantino once again prove that they currently are the masters of gore. In Rodriguez's portion, Planet Terror, he does the one thing every horror fan loves, and that is put as much blood and gore as possible. In Planet Terror, almost every scene is pretty graphic, although the makers attempt to make it look like a classic film, the visual effects are that of the future. The film spends very little time giving background information as to why the zombie epidemic broke out in the first place, and spends most of the time splattering blood all over the place.

140,native_girl333,Ode for the old times,9,22 December 2007,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez made their fantasies come true by making ""Grindhouse"", a double-feature picture show. Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is the second feature which combines action and zombie-horror.From the start Rodriguez makes the audience enjoy with opening sequence with director's cousin Danny Trejo. Rodriguez respects old movies and especially older action/horror flicks which shows. The acting is seriously ""bad"" because it is made so in the spirit of old splash-core horror genre. You can see that the amazing and talented cast have really enjoyed making ""Planet Terror"" because they have made it seriously with humor. Freddy Rodriguez made a huge impression as El Wray. Rose McGowan managed to surprise, and I was pleased to see Lost-star Naveen Andrews among the cast. Jeff Fahey is funny as an owner of a dodgy bar/restaurant Bar B.Q . Quentin Tarantino's appearance as a nasty rapist-mutant is gross but hilarious. Bruce Willis is also on board.""Planet Terror"" and Tarantino's part ""Death Proof"" are made looking old with grumply picture and reel changes. Nevertheless the story happens present time. There is references to Hollywood scene and resent happenings. Rodriguez expresses his stand on a mysterious case of Osama Bin Laden which is interesting, indeed.It is a real shame that ""Grindhouse"" didn't make it as two films together because the movies should be watched one after another as intended because the separation eats the idea a bit.

141,SimonHeide,Intentionally bad remake of old gore movies.,8,17 November 2007,"I suppose you have to have some sort of recollection of gore movies from the seventies in order to enjoy this flick. For me it was both a nostalgic and hilarious experience to watch. The dialog is very corny; I was laughing my lungs out when the two protagonist  driving in a car at night - watches some zombies pulling a half-eaten, dead body off the road. She (Cherry Darling!) turns to el Wray ""What the hell was that?"" and he goes very reassuring ""people picking up road-kill"" - as if this is a very often occurring and natural thing.Its intentionally bad which I think must be a big artistic challenge to make. The humor in it has to a large extent to do with the fact that it comments on some of the clichés and stereotypes you watch in an average Hollywood movie (of course more so in the before mentioned genre). You also sense a lot of love for the gore genre  which I think Tarantino has shown us in earlier movies  why else bother? I am wondering if this could develop into a cult movie as it doesn't appeal to a larger audience but still has some strong creative elements in it. Although you might not like this flick you must respect it for the courage that the producers and director has.Rose McGowan is such a hottie.! /Simon PS. the preview of the movie ""Machete"" - looks like it is actually gonna be made.

It seems like a huge waste of money and talent in overall. The visual style works and the colour scheme of the movie is just gloomy and dark enough to create suspense but that is completely destroyed by the overall stupidity of the film.The comedy part just doesn't work if there's a joke in every other line of the dialogue. Most of the jokes just seem too silly and really out of the place and i think that i have a good sense of humour. I just didn't think it was funny watching a pointless movie where characters are just statists without any character development and history. Or at least they're so unbelievably stupid that i never managed to understand them.Things just happen and the movie jumps from one scene to another in a quite fast pace. It's disappointing to see that the film could have been made into a serious zombie movie which might have revived the genre but it's just another zombie movie with same tired elements. On top of that it's not scary at all.Shaun of the Dead is so much better than this and it seems that Hollywood is suffering of a serious lack of imagination.,Planet Terror

Anyway, ""Planet Terror"" is the first section of ""Grindhouse"" about a group of people who have to face a hoard of people who've been turned into zombies because of a gas called DC-2. This was a really fun movie to watch. I love how Robert Rodriguez makes it look like a movie from the 70s with all of the aging effects in it. Plus, I like the gun in Rose McGowan's leg. It's so cool. You almost wonder how Rodriguez comes up with the stuff. Is he like Sam Raimi, who created the chainsaw in the hand for Ash in ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness?"" Who knows.

But there's no need for a fight between the two movies here : ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" are like brother movies, that were thought together, and were meant to be seen together in the double feature ""Grinhouse"" Project. QT works on the script of ""Planet Terror"", and I'm sure lots of the great ideas of the movie came from him.

Any number of real drive-in trash movies from the early 1970s are better than this film is.For self-styled film buffs, Rodriguez and Tarantino display a spectacular lack of understanding of what made those old grindhouse movies work. The point was that the original films transcended their low budgets and poor actors by virtue of the talent and energy of their directors.But maybe that was a challenge too far for Team Tarantino. By giving themselves the insurance of genuinely talented actors like Michael Biehn and Naveen Andrews (even if the thesps act like they're slumming it), they fail to set themselves the same challenge faced by their predecessors ... so we don't end up with a great trash movie. We don't even get a pretty good trash movie. We just get an average trash movie. And that's pretty much the worst kind of movie you can get.",Planet Terror
146,misbegotten,A gleeful and unapologetic B movie celebration,8,28 September 2008,"Planet Terror is a lot of fun, although the artificial aging and scratching of the film (to recreate the 'grindhouse' viewing experience) is a joke that soon wears thin. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez has declared in interviews that the movie is his homage to John Carpenter, and you can easily spot elements from such Carpenter films as Assault on Precinct 13, Escape From New York, The Thing, Escape From LA, and Ghosts of Mars . In fact, Carpenter was originally going to compose Planet Terror's score, but for whatever reason it didn't happen, and Rodriguez eventually wrote all the music himself.The movie's premise has a gaseous bio-weapon being accidentally released on a disused army base in Texas, transforming anyone who's infected into a crazed, cannibalistic berserker. A small band of people who possess a natural immunity try to avoid being eaten while searching for a way of escaping the area. It's interesting to compare Planet Terror to a previous Rodriguez movie - Once Upon a Time in Mexico. That earlier film was burdened with so many supporting characters and dedicated subplots that it staggered about and eventually collapsed under it's own weight. Rodriguez takes a similar approach in Planet Terror, but has clearly learnt from the mistakes he made in Mexico and this time he insures that the film never loses focus.Amongst the various individuals fighting the brain-eating mutants are barbecue chef J.T. (played by B movie veteran Jeff Fahey), who's spent 25 years trying to perfect his BBQ sauce, and is involved in a feud with his landlord - who also happens to be both his brother and the local sheriff (and is portrayed by another B movie legend, Michael Biehn). There's also Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), who's just quit her job as a stripper and is hoping to forge a new career as a stand-up comedian. Plus she's just crossed paths with an ex-lover - brooding leather-jacketed loner El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez, no relation). And let's not forget Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton), secretly leaving her abusive husband and running away with her lesbian girlfriend (who's played by Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas). Phew! I won't even mention Bruce Willis's extended cameo.The highlight of the movie is Cherry replacing her severed leg with a M16 machine gun/rocket launcher combo. This doesn't occur until the last fifteen minutes of the film, but it's well worth the wait, as she proceeds to spectacularly unleash the firepower of her newly acquired appendage upon the rampaging infectees. A great action set-piece.Other memorable sequences include El Wray singlemindedly making his way through the chaos of an over-run hospital, dispatching opponents with a pair of butterfly knives; Dakota's attempts to flee being impeded by her inability to open a car door after both her hands have been injected with muscle relaxant; a high speed car chase across a bridge crowded with infectees; and Cherry driving a wrecking truck through a burning building.The only downside in Planet Terror is the tenancy for a juvenile level of nastiness to occasionally creep in. For example, Naveen Andrews plays a black market bio-weapons dealer who's so ruthless that after killing his enemies, he keeps their testicles as souvenirs. And there's also an attempted rape scene in which the would-be attacker's intentions are thwarted by the fact that his member is melting and falling off. Ugh. I'm not squeamish, but this is both just childish and a cynical, calculated attempt to gross out the audience. Unnecessary.",Planet Terror

The total opposite of Death Proof, but still excelent, this outrageous schlock horror tribute is pure trash... in the best possible sense.",Planet Terror
148,Cemetarygirl,Trashy drive-in cinema at its best,10,12 July 2008,"This is my unashamedly guilty pleasure. An emotional ride from first bump to the last grind. From the opening credits and Roses dancing to the sexually intoxicating music. I was hooked. Rose does a stunning job in this film and to watch her and listen to her throw away lines makes this film well worth watching. That is not to take away from the other great cast and Freddy was superb in his role as El Ray. He completely drew me in and made his part extremely believable. One thing that made this move was the choice of cast as each person played his or her part in the interaction of their roles. I hated Josh Brolin and could have shot Tarantino thereby proving their abilities to make their characters believable. Even Fergy (who only had a short screen time) was great and I wish she could have lasted a bit longer. Of course this was over the top. It was supposed to be, after all Who could with out a bit of practice strap a gun to their leg and shoot off into the air, or rotate in the manner that Rose did without falling over. But that is the great thing about imagination. One can do anything. As can Rodriguez as he assaults our senses to almost overload and we come away from the picture feeling tired and exhausted. Because we went on that ride too. I love his films and his talents and I hope he has many many more films such as this up his sleeve",Planet Terror
149,Medacakathareal,A lot of fun,8,28 October 2008,"Planet Terror is a homage to the trash that used to play at drive-ins back in the 70s, particularly, its a zombie film. Being a lover of zombies I was stoked when I sat down to watch it. The movie delivers everything a fan of the horror-comedy-action genre could want, over the top action, over the top gore, and at times over the top acting. We follow a few main characters, all of which are enigmatic and end up having connections that no one would have seen coming, which reminded me of the low budget films that used to come out back in the day, where the director would try to weave in so many subplots the whole thing becomes silly (and a lot of fun)...The movie is heavy on gore and there's a ton of beautiful women, therefore its a visually pleasing film to watch, especially with the premature aging effect they use to make the movie seem old.Another factor I was excited about was Micheal Biehn, I haven't seen him in an action oriented roll in a while and it was good to see him back in action (whatever happened to him anyway?). The plot is fairly simple, a zombie outbreak in which the survivors are the cure for the zombie infection and have to survive.Its a really fun movie, and is the better half of Grindhouse (Death Proof seemed like a very ODD chick flick). I recommend it highly to anyone who likes zombies...",Planet Terror
150,Junker-2,Lost me after 30 minutes...,2,30 July 2008,"This movie seems to be quite divisive. Some people love it while others absolutely hate it. There is actually a pretty simple way to tell which side of the coin you will find yourself on: Within the first 20 minutes of this movie you will see the following:1) A guy gets his testicles cut off by another guy who carries around a jar full of testicles.2) A patient comes into a doctor's office with growths on his tongue. The doctor squeezes one and it pops like a zit spewing blood all around.Now. If you are thinking to yourself ""Cool! I want to see that!"" then by all means give ""Planet Terror"" a watch. On the other hand, if you're saying to yourself ""Um...no thank you"" then take a pass.I don't judge. Looking all the comments here on the IMDb, it appears that there is quite a market for this type of movie. As for me, I gave up after 30 minutes. Life is too short, you know?Oh, okay.

152,darklydreamingrahu,Possibly the best zombie film ever made,9,23 October 2011,"There are some zombie films that you watch just because you want to see zombies get destroyed. Some you watch to be terrified (George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" and Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead""). Others you watch for the artistic value or tight examination of human values (28 Days Later). Still others you watch for the comedy (Shaun of the Dead). Planet Terror is all of this and more. While it's an obvious homage to 70's exploitation flicks during the ""Grindhouse era"", it's moreso just a fantastic movie. Everything works here. The acting is top- rate, the plot is well-defined, and the zombies are scary. The several subplots are well-connected and very intriguing. Stylistically this movie achieves everything it sets out to do. Comedically, there is several laugh-out-loud moments on par with ""Shaun of the Dead."" In regards to horror, the zombies are very convincing and gory to boot. It's actually the psychopathic doctor and his estranged wife that most of the examination of humanity comes to fruition. Some truly disturbing human elements play out in the midst of the zombie chaos with this strange story. Also, the zombie outbreak is well-explained and believable. The apocalyptic feeling is fully realized, especially at the thrilling conclusion. This is Rodriguez' most fun film to date. Everything in it churns on all cylinders from beginning to end. I watched the whole Grindhouse double feature in the theaters when it was released and multiple times since its DVD release. I'm convinced Planet Terror is a new zombie classic. It is a great movie as well as a great zombie movie. Since it's so hard to produce truly unique and satisfying zombie films, I give this one a perfect score (which I don't do often). 10/10",Planet Terror
153,Pythe,Ridiculously entertaining,10,29 April 2008,"I have yet to see Tarantino's half of the Grindhouse double feature, but Rodriguez's contribution, a worthy addition to the zombie sub-genre, may be his best original work so far. Given that the Grindhouse project almost by definition repels storytelling responsibility, Rodriguez wastes no time in plunging to the depths of excess and reveling there for the entirety of the film.The actual plot isn't all that original--some chemical weapon or other is unleashed on an unsuspecting public, turning them into flesh-craving zombies--but watching this kind of film for the story is pretty much missing the point. The ensemble cast is pitch-perfect in portraying the myriad characters, each with their own half-crazed (or full-crazed) motivations and desires. There's the wife having a lesbian affair, the restaurant owner who seems almost more concerned with discovering the recipe for an award-winning barbecue sauce than the impending apocalypse, the mysterious gunslinger who was born with killing in his blood, and a dozen others. A film awash with such diverse characters is usually in danger of losing sight of them as people, but everyone in Planet Terror has a satisfying character arc, and the multiple intertwining story lines converge in a way that feels natural rather than forced or guided by the filmmaker. Even in a sort of stylized world where people forget the deaths of loved ones thirty seconds after they died, everyone feels fully fleshed out and acts according to the bizarre logic set up by the film.The visual style, contrary to what one might expect for a movie that tries to look as beat up as possible, is so perfect as to be almost awe-inspiring. Rodriguez clearly grew up watching cheap prints in drive-in theaters that, as a result of having toured the country one theater at a time, looked as though they had been dragged behind a car several times before being projected; he knows the value of every scratch and clumsy splice. Of course, having the benefit of adding the damage manually probably comes in handy--the washes of solid colors and the missing reels come into the picture, funnily enough, exactly where they're most effective. The lighting is also quite beautiful in that rough, low-budget 1970s way, where it makes everything harsh and textured and grainy.I think what surprised and delighted me most about the film was the writing. Though I like Rodriguez's films, he's never blown me away with his storytelling prowess. Here, however, he's in rare form. Rather than merely making the plot a buildup to a gunfight, Rodriguez allows the characters to bounce off each other in unexpected ways, building tension between these two, taking that relationship in a completely unexpected direction. None of the characters are really good or bad in the cut-and-dry, black-and-white sense; people who seem virtuous suddenly turn out to be insane; villains become allies; agendas are hidden and exposed and redefined, and reality constantly shifts. Most impressive were the numerous lines of dialogue that turned into motifs or took on added significance when repeated later on. Perhaps working with Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) on the phony trailer for ""Don't"" rubbed off on Robert. The only real flaw is that the 105-minute version, which is the only version I saw, goes on for perhaps a hair too long.Planet Terror walks a pretty fine line between camp and genuine horror, but somehow in the midst of the gallons of gore, the guns that never need to reload, the gorgeous heroines in short skirts and tight tank tops, and the gas tanks that need very little persuasion to explode, it manages to emerge as a darkly comedic masterwork of the B-movie genre. I guarantee that you won't have more fun at the movies for a long time to come.",Planet Terror

""Background not fully introduced"".IntroductionAccording to IMDb, Planet Terror is a 2007 Action, Comedy, and Horror movie.StorylineMany themes greet your eyes and ears with Planet terror. These include: Gore, love, comedy, relationships, varied character personalities, and light-hearted tone. Lack of thinking was necessary throughout. It linked phrases, (first mentioned early in the film), to later parts, by repeating the same phrases.
Lack of tension-building or suspense was apparent, mostly due to it's light -hearted nature. Contrast between serious and funny wasn't quite stark enough to dub this a horror, however it almost manages to be.Film aspects such as girls, sex, flames, gore, weapons, would appeal to a younger male adult target audience, perhaps someone in their late teens, I'd suggest.
There was also some clever camera work. The plot didn't really make much sense, but counting in it's favour, introducing it's events properly would be a colossal task.GenreMore comedy, and action than anything. Had some good horror elements, but tension and fear factor wasn't there. These define horror.MusicIn terms of music, background sounds were consistent with tension, becoming louder and more dramatic in these moments.CharactersThere were plenty of charming, varied, and well-portrayed characters. Characters included familiar locals, and specialist professionals. Relationships were believable, despite the light-hearted tone of the film. The ending emphasised this point.One character was played particularly well. She managed to capture the message of equality in society effectively, whilst still playing a key part in a ""major role"" relationship. Definitely one of the acting highlights of this film...SummaryLight-hearted, humorous, and action-packed. More contrast and fear factor needed, to appease the adult target audience.Follow us at reasea dot org",Planet Terror

This movie violates virtually every cardinal rule for good movies, but they are violated so profoundly and with such zest you can't help but enjoy yourself with it.Sure, it's got plot holes, ludicrous action, gore and outfits no sane girl would wear outside in the middle of the night, but underneath it all is a good story about people you come to care for.

If you too are interested in some brainless viewing then watch this movie! Mind you, those of you who are squeamish steer well clear of this one, as it does tend to get a little gory in (most) parts! It's all tongue in cheek of course! I managed to watch it in conjunction with Tarantino's ""Death Proof"", and while I am a fan of both films, I'd have say ""Planet Terror"" takes the title for the being the most fun to watch out of the two! Laced with funny dialogue and chocked full of over the top action sequences, the film really does excel!

157,waterman_harry,"Exploitive Insanity, Grimy Strippers and Zombies Affair",6,26 April 2015,"I preferred Death Proof.... I found Robert Rodriguez to be on top-form throughout this inspired zombie/action/exploitation flick, however much of the duration of the film is like a stuffy, cramped elevator, regarding the over-kill on supporting characters that are really relevant to absolutely nothing. It is almost like a Broadway show with the amount of forgettable characters providing mere comic relief or a nonsensical meandering from the plot. The grainy style of Grindhouse cinema works well whilst watching Rose McGowan play a go-go dancer with a machine gun for a leg that is somehow fully functional as an actual weapon, shooting missiles at zombies. Don't try to make sense of it, you'll probably die. Oh, and watch it with friends when you're drinking, its most fun then.",Planet Terror
158,luke-346,"Iconic, kitsch and hyper-violent - an entertaining roller-coaster ride!!",8,6 February 2008,"Iconic, kitsch and hyper-violent Planet Terror is an entertaining roller coaster ride for all those fans that are so familiar with the junk culture that is often witnessed in the films of Robert Rodriguez. Planet Terror began life as the second part of a double package feature called Grindhouse (the first part of this feature being Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof) and this is how it was distributed upon its US release, however because it fared poorly at the box office the films were split and extended versions of each were released separately onto the European market. This was arguably an unfortunate move and for those that are not aware Grindhouse refers to a certain type of exploitation film made predominantly in the 1970s on low budgets - these films mainly attracted audiences by exciting their more lascivious and vulgar interests with an unwitting disregard for the more intrinsic parts of the film making process i.e. plot, character development, camera work etc. Splitting the films may have benefited them financially but not artistically as it has highlighted their references and intertextuality. The singular treatment of these films has removed the main attribute associated with Grindhouse cinema – that of back-to-back billing, the term ""Grindhouse"" (of grinding out a viewing) even alludes to this notion. Notable examples of intertextuality are the sharing of characters and locations (i.e. Sheriff McGraw and the hospital) and the references in the dialogue to events in the other feature. The films were clearly made to contemplate each other, one being more artistically and intellectually accessible and the other being a cleverly choreographed mish-mash of iconic symbols and outlandish imagery.In brief; Planet Terror takes place in contemporary Texas and begins with a military transaction going wrong and causing a deadly gas to be released initiating the onset of mutating cannibals that start running amok. Where as Death Proof managed a more authentic representation of Grindhouse films Planet Terror serves up a comedic distortion of them. Audiences that were lucky (or unlucky) enough to witness those films in their 70s heyday will recall a larger sense of horror and repulsion, that wasn't all that funny. However the two are similar in some respects as like Death Proof, Planet Terror heavily utilizes some the physical aspects of Grindhouse cinema, including scratches on negatives, missing reels (the missing reel being perhaps the highlight of the film) and distorted sound/score. A blatant genre reference is made through the score in the film as it is borrowed heavily from John Carpenter. Broadly speaking John Carpenters music relies on tension and the majority of his work is constructed around this premise, but because Planet Terror is so cluttered and chaotic it cannot deliver such levels of tension so ultimately its use seems futile. Through trying too hard to recapture, or even imitate, a bygone era of forgotten and decadent films Planet Terror fails because it is too relentless in its approach and as a result tinkers with being farcical.I have no real problems with the theme, character development or cinematography as the films ultimate aim is to hark back to the low budget, depraved and often immoral films of the 70s. So to complain about the story or the disjointed plot would be to unwittingly complement the film on it's accuracy in depicting the films of yester year. However, Planet Terror is undoubtedly a pinnacle of junk culture; it heaps on to the audience staggering amounts of blood, gore, shock and horror which is unfortunately its downfall. With such concentrated levels of visceral entertainment the film succumbs to being too indulgent. The hedonistic nature of Planet Terror is unforgettably entertaining with many of the films images already iconic. But through being so frenzied the film fails to convey any real development and the audience is left reeling from nothing more than a spectacle as highlighted in the opening scene which begins with an almost demure yet frantically directed pole dance by Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan). The pole dance then shifts to her dressing room to partially reveal two blonde dancers making-out (pure spectacle, because if Planet terror was trying to pastiche Grindhouse then the girls would have at least had some narrative purpose, perhaps even had a fight) – without giving too much away the film culminates through a blood thirsty battle which leads us to several apocalyptic landscapes which is reminiscent of the final reels of Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn – a much better take on a cult genre. Ultimately Planet Terror is a film with realisations that are too obvious and pretentious as it is a film made by an individual and Production Company that we know are capable of a lot more, and it is unfortunate that this knowledge transpires itself to the finished product. With Grindhouse cinema the audiences were fully aware that films were low budget, made to the best of the ability of those involved and shock tactics were sparingly employed to arouse notoriety or advertisement, regrettably Rodriguez is a good director but unlike Tarantino he can't make a serious pastiche.",Planet Terror
159,dustinhunter707,Good!!,9,21 October 2007,"OK I really enjoyed this Grindhouse movie a lot more than Death Proof because it wasn't boring at all and it was as entertaining as it was disgusting and I loved it. Rose McGowan is pretty awesome in this as being a bad ass and at being sexy. I also liked the appearances from other cool stars such as Bruce Willis and Michael Biehn, this movie is a lot of fun and anyone who loves violent entertainment will definitely get a kick out of Planet Terror, I know I did.

160,jakespick,i can't quite put my finger on it....,6,2 November 2007,"...i still can't, oh well, this movie is VERY, VERY entertaining in almost every way. If you like Rodriguez, this is the perfect movie to show what he can do. However, comparing this to the ORIGINAL grindhouse features, i might give it a 6 MAYBE 7 out of 10. If you are wondering why, it is because this film doesn't have enough raw sexuality, and it's violence could be more explicit. But if you don't compare this to the original movies back in the day, this film ranks in the TOP 10 movies of all time for me!Other than all that, probably the most original and exciting idea i have ever heard of, is having fake movie trailers. I don't think people come to see Grindhouse just because of Planet Terror (i heard Death Proof wasn't good) i think they also come for the fake trailers! All of the trailers were so cool, raw, and kickas.s! ""Thanksgiving"" is phenomenal! Machete is ACTUALLY being made by Robert Rodriguez right Now (sick movie! ""Don't"" is hilarious and ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" is one of the coolest Rob Zombie ideas i have ever heard of!

161,paulmamak,"A fair film from Rodriguez, but lacked his usual magic.",6,22 March 2008,"As with Death Proof, this film should have remained as a double feature in Grindhouse. The overall cast is impressive, so it is a shame that the film did not turn out the same way. The film starts off with a an outstanding score, a trademark of Rodriguez that unfortunately is supported by a relatively poor go-go dance. At this time you realise that it is supposed to be a poor quality film, therefore purposely filmed crackling effects are added, which simply did not work considering that the overall film quality was high.From then on it is a relatively easy horror/comedy, with a few humorous moments, such as the balls collection, the female anaesthetist and the fact that you find out that the doctor's wife has been having an affair with another woman, and she subsequently has both her hand's anaesthetised.From then on each cast member has their odd funny moment and memorable quote, but do little to develop their characters , due to the fact that it originally was a much shorter feature.

162,grenmonkey,Brilliant,7,13 October 2009,"Planet Terror (2007) is a brilliant film; it shamelessly takes all the things we love from cheesy 80's action, zombie and horror films and crushes it all to one solid package that is both funny and thrilling. Bad ""one-liners"", lots of shooting, gore related jokes, cheesy ""ominous soundtrack"" and all the other bits and pieces that make you smile are there to be found in this film. This is Robert Rodriguez at his best.A bio-weapon gets released and turns people into zombies – a mixed bunch of small town survivors have to make their way to more safer grounds. Among the survivors are Wray (Freddy Rodríguez), go-go dancer Cherry (Rose McGowan) and Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) who all fit perfectly into the bizarre setting as the stereotypes they are, the casting throughoutly is just right.The film looks good and is fun to watch; the deliberate improper cuts, sound distortions and visual filters all add up to the unorthodox movie experience. The jokes are plentiful, the action is well shot, the story takes some unexpected turns and the ensemble cast is good – the film's really entertaining. It's not perfect though: the pacing is off at times and Robert has taken the ""easy way"" a bit too often with the script (there was room for more subtle jokes among the more obvious ones) but still the film's fun to sit through.

165,kenvandenbussche-2,How to terrorize the planet with only one movie ...,3,25 October 2007,"""Grindhouse"" is the latest project by director buddies Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. It exists out of two movies that were put together by a couple of fake movie trailers in between. I have already written a comment on the first part of this project; namely the Quentin Tarantino movie ""Death proof"". The second part is the movie by Robert Rodriguez and is called ""Planet terror"". The reason why I decided to do both movies apart is because that's exactly how they were shown here in Belgium. Two very different movies that seemingly had nothing in common. I suppose when the DVD will come out, these two movies will become one again as they were originally meant to be. I - for one - am not interested because I kind of disliked the latter one.But this is not the first time that Tarantino and Rodriguez worked together. The first time that they did, was when Quentin Tarantino played a small yet hilarious part in the 1995 action-movie ""Desperado"" directed by Rodriguez featuring a great Antonio Banderas in the lead. Then they each created a segment in the cult-classic ""Four rooms""; a movie about a bellboy who has four entirely different experiences in an equal amount of hotel rooms. Two of those experiences were directed by each of these men. Then they both created another cult-classic namely ""From dusk till dawn"" and only quite recently they both gave life to Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" by turning it into a viciously interesting film-noir action-thriller.Of all the things that these two talented directors have done together, ""From dusk till dawn"" is the one that matches ""Grindhouse"" the best. It too exists out of two parts. The first part of ""From dusk till dawn"" is pure crime with a fantastic George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino himself as his psycho brother; perhaps his finest acting to date. Halfway the movie it abruptly switches to an action-packed horror-movie which is still a lot of fun to watch but ends up weakening the film. ""From dusk till dawn"" is still a good movie, but it could've been so much more. Of course: one part cannot live without the other. And that's the difference with project ""Grindhouse"". The two movies that were put together can easily be separated from each other. Bottomline is: I only care for the Tarantino-movie ""Death proof"", so to me there is no such thing as project ""Grindhouse"" because its latter part is weak and stupid.But let's talk about the second part of project ""Grindhouse"". Robert Rodriguez loves zombies as much as Tarantino loves crime. And that's why the Texas director decided to do what he loves the most. He wanted to make a low-budget horror-movie about zombies. I'm not sure what the real intentions were of Robert Rodriguez whilst he was shooting this movie, but ""Planet terror"" ended up being the most ridiculous movie ever made! It is a horror-movie that features ten times the amount of blood any ""Hellraiser""-movie contains. It is a stupid, chaotic and painfully ludicrous joyride of uninteresting characters killing hundreds of fake-looking zombies in the most preposterous way. It is the dumbest popcorn-movie of all times and it contains so much disgusting gore and splattering blood that it actually starts to become amusing. For all of its nonsense though, it never felt like a really bad movie. ""Planet terror"" knows that it is a brainless motion picture and everyone involved treat it as such and that's why this movie isn't a total disaster.Then again: I could not get myself to laugh at the bloodfest. There is no story whatsoever to support the horror, so every now and then you are looking at zombies disemboweling dying people without knowing how to feel. Should I laugh now or should I feel sorry? At least ""From dusk till dawn"" had something interesting to tell. Not that I will alter my opinion on this movie, but I did like the voluptuous women though. The movie starts off with a very erotic stripper at a club and we get many other sexy babes throughout this movie. Although I can appreciate such divine beauty, I fail to see what it has to do with the plot. But then again: there is no plot. There is no story. There are only a bunch of people in panic armed to the teeth ready to be the next meal of any ugly-looking zombie. The only real uplifting moment for me (from a movie point-of-view) was the come-back of gifted actor Michael Biehn. Film-freaks such as myself will undoubtedly recognize the name or the face, because back in the '80s Canadian director James Cameron made a star out of Michael Biehn by allowing him to play in no less than three of his masterpieces: ""The terminator"", ""Aliens"" and ""The abyss"". Michael Biehn is definitely the only decent actor in this film. The rest of the cast is not necessarily bad, but at a certain moment you just stop caring about their characters and their mediocre acting.In short: ""Planet terror"" isn't a bad movie; it's just made for a very limited audience - especially hardcore horror-fans. Those who find blood and gore funny should check this one out! Everyone else ought to stay away as far as possible. I'm somewhere in the middle; I guess. I never laughed or smiled at it, but I was also never really bored. Maybe the women in this movie kept me wide awake. My final verdict is that ""Planet terror"" is weak movie like so many other dim-witted zombie-movies.",Planet Terror

When a experimental bio-weapon turns your average Joe Blogs into crazy zombies, all hell is let loose and a group of survivors decide to arm them self's and fight back. The movie kicks of with a fantastic sleazy dance by the main heroine Cherry Darling (the sexy Rose Mcgowan), this sets the tone for the whole movie, with the film print deliberately scratched and the occasional bad edits and even a missing reel its all part off the trashy fun. Note: some viewers might not like the way the film was shot, this is no MTV slick, shiny production, this is pure exploitation, this is GRINDHOUSE, so get with it.As you would expect from Robert Rodriguez he stages the blood and carnage with glee, its his most outrages movie yet, when the zombies get shot left right and centre the blood spurts out in an OTT manner, there's plenty of sick effects to keep all you gore hounds happy, and its a good companion piece to Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". Its a shame that the movie tanked at the box office, but it does deserve a 2nd chance. Never has so much trash been so much fun.",Planet Terror
168,conmech,Zombie Movie For Fun,8,17 December 2007,"Director Robert Rodriguez always had a special place for me, because I respected all his movies for good directing, but never enjoyed any of them. So ""Planet Terror"" is a first in this sense. It's a fun zombie type movie which uses aspects of old movies, including shooting, angles, music, even missing reel, and all these things were done in a creative way, not just for the sake of making a different movie. The only strange thing is, the movie takes place in the present (with latest model cell-phones and stuff) while the shooting of the movie represents the 70s or 80s. It's not a bad thing, just hard to adjust to.Even though I said it's fun to watch, it's definitely not a funny movie, or a movie making fun of old horror movies. So if u're not into bloody horror movies, don't even think about watching this extra gory movie. I'm saying it's a ""fun"" movie because despite its blood and guts, it can't come even close to the suspense of movies like ""28 Days Later"". The main difference between those two movies is ""28 Days Later"" kept me on the edge of my seat, and when it was completely over I remembered to take a breath. ""Planet Terror"" on the other hand is a movie you can sit back and enjoy the art of gore.One more thing, this might be a spoiler, but ""Planet Terror"" ends with the happiest ending I've ever seen in a zombie movie. Especially this ending is what makes ""Planet Terror"" an over bloody action movie rather than a horror movie. So as a conclusion, if you like zombie movies you'll definitely enjoy this one too.",Planet Terror
169,JustBe333,One of my favorite theater going experiences,9,29 November 2019,"When this movie came out as
GRINDHOUSE(Planet Terror + Death Proof)
It was so awesome. A movie that you have to go to the movies for. Not because it's deep or philosophical or spiritual or inspiring.... because it is pure unadulterated fun.
Lots of A B and C list actors in B movies shot like A movies and edited to look like C movies.
That sums up both movies.
This one of the 2 is the one I enjoy more. It's gritty and dark. Gloriously violent and gratuitous..... more boobs would have been nice but I respect the cast wanting to be classy as can be while rocking a trashy gore fest.
The dialogue can be both hilarious and hilariously bad but it's all on purpose.
I recommend this one for ALL zombie fans and ALL fans of B movies. It's a fun/funny/bloody thrill ride with sickeningly awesome and cheesy Effects. And rose mcgowan is sooooo hot with that machine gun leg.... wth happened to her. ...and anyone else wonder how she fires that machine gun leg?

Then there's some genuinely comical dialog as we're introduced to her character. Somewhere along the line, the story deteriorates into a bizarre parody, kind of a Naked Gun meets Dawn of the Dead. Though my copy of the movie was scratched, the cinematography was still beautiful, with vivid colors and chiaroscuro tones, which could have created a unique mood had Robert Rodriguez not gone on what seemed like an hour-and-a-half-long sugar high.

Being a great fan of George Romero's excellent ""Dead"" movies, I was just expecting more considering the hype around best buddies Rodriquez/Tarantino. If there was ever an overrated pairing! How did they get anyone to pay up money for this? This is just a series of tired pastiches. OK, maybe that was what was intended but honestly, all this was done so much better and great effect in Shaun of the Dead. My advice, watch that several times rather than waste 2 hours on this nonsense. At least with Shaun of the Dead you won't be left with the feeling that you've lost 2 hours of your life that you won't get back AND you'll have been entertained.

""Planet Terror"" definitely owns ""Death Proof"" in the gore department, whether that is good or bad is up to you. However, I did enjoy the fact that Rose McGowan's character in ""Planet Terror"" (Cherry) is much more empowered and independent than her role in ""Death Proof"". That ""Planet Terror"" contains zombies only adds to the appeal; the main message derived is that in the face of destruction and adversity, Cherry still fights back and refuses to give in.

Not this film. This movie delivered every bit of excitement and entertainment that the preview promised. I just simply cannot find anything bad to say about this movie. It was well acted, well scripted (though maybe not quite as excellent dialogue as Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof but that's not to be expected), well paced, and well shot. Had plenty of action, a little bit of slower parts for character and plot development but really no down time, and was creative and just overall completely 100% satisfying.

187,Sternicus,Finally Rodriguez gets it right!!!,9,21 March 2008,"To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of this film except for maybe a few over the top violent action sequences and a couple disturbing images. But I was delightedly surprised to see that it was much better written than some of Rodriguez's earlier work. (Once Opoun A Time in Mexico.) It has some of the best and most quotable dialog in a film I've ever seen since Pulp Fiction. (Which I gave a bad review to ironically.) The film seems to be almost overlapped with dialog specifically put together to make something brilliant. Rodriguez has also inherited another unique characteristic from Quentin Tarantino; the ability to deny a cliché'. The scene where Tony Block accidentally shoots himself in the car was totally unexpected, and made for one helluva twist. Rodriguez had made two versions. One in which the little boy played by his own real life son lives, and the other which was the finished product that we saw were he doesn't. To me it was that scene along with the scene of Quentin's melting genitals that made the film what it is. A shocking yet entertaining roller-coaster thrill ride. Something that Rodrigues has been trying to achieve for years and this time finally does. In the past his films had weak dialog and graphically violent action (Once Opoun Atime in Mexico.) or were an adaptation of someone else's twisted idea. (SinCity) But this time it refreshing to see some fresh and original that came from him. And it really was fun. Rodriguez has perfected a sense of timing that gives Planet Terror a distinct charm. Like the projector ""missing a reel"" just when the sex scene is about to get too colorful. Memorable dialog has a way of being repeated so that people remember it. ""I will eat your brains and gain your knowledge."" ""No more dead bodies for daddy tonight."" ""And after this friend I'll never see you again."" Rodriguez delivers. His heroin Cherry is one of the hottest female protagonist ever on cinema. In many ways he's surpassed Quentin in his own right and has developed a new talent for writing and he should keep with that and can only wait for him to let lose again.",Planet Terror
188,mustardman29,More garbage,2,15 October 2007,"This is the second worst movie I have seen in years. The worst was DeathProof which I gave a 1. At least there is some action in this one and it doesn't pretend to reflect any sort of reality. The babe factor didn't hurt. I admit that I never saw the whole movie. I had to fast forward through the last third as I just couldn't stand to watch it anymore. I had better things to do like clip my toe nails. Yes I do realize he intentionally tried to make this look like a drive in B movie and it worked a little too well. Ironically, the best part of this movie was the fake interlude in the middle with a commercial for some fake movie. That was actually kind of entertaining. Where do I see that one?!",Planet Terror
189,BigBirdtheBum,So bad it is somehow good??? I don't think so- but then again i am a minority.,3,28 February 2008,"To be straight to the point I honestly do not see why this film was loved by so many. To but it bluntly it is a B-movie, and don't people hate B movies? Apparently they do unless of course the film is intended to be a B- Movie, does that like somehow make it good? I simply to not understand how people can give this film 10's. To me it should be rated how a majority of B movies are, in the 4's and 5's. Look, don't get me wrong or anything, I don't hate B-movies I actually have loved a few, for example I loved Peter Jackson's Bad Taste. But this film I just couldn't love, but I understand how people can though.This film is actually very hard to review as a majority of the flaws are intentional and deliberate to attract audiences who are familiar or interested in ""Grindhouse's"". So I will do my best. The plot itself is a typical B-movie plot about a bunch of military soldiers seeking a cure for a disease that turns people into zombies or as fans call them- ""sicko's"", as they themselves were exposed to it for killing, Osama Bin Laden. Yeah that's right Bin Laden!! The soldiers approach a military science base and attempt to find a cure, and after a shootout the biological gas is released into the air and the townspeople in contact with it become flesh hungry sicko's. After this brief but nonetheless cheesy introduction, the story then involves several survivors, trying to make it out of the town alive and stop the horrible disease from spreading. And I must say what weird characters they all are. We have the typical ""bad boy"" who becomes good and saves everyone, an overused character stereotype, a female tabletop dancer who ends up having a machine-gun for her leg- I mean what the ----!!! Not only is that weird it would normally make audiences say it would make a film bad, but in this case the applaud it and admire it! Again another thing I just simply cant see why anyone would like that.Aside from having a terrible assortment of characters that would only appeal to B-movie fans and of course Robert Rodriguez fans, the film also has a very weird and silly plot that I found in the least bit engaging. The plot itself picks up relatively fast, which is good but kind of slows down and develops less quickly in the middle. Which is rather a shame as I thought some of the middle scenes, i.e. the scenes at the bar (at least I think it is a bar) would have been a lot more beneficial to the plot if they were a lot longer. The plot seems at times so simple a 12 year old that has just seen a zombie film could have made it, which I guess would be attracting for fans of B-movies but as I said earlier, not for me.However, thankfully this film is not all bad. I managed to find some enjoyment in the gore effects. I found these effects to be way over the top and exaggerated that I felt like I was watching ""Dawn of the Dead"" 1978. This is good as I have always loved that film, and enjoyed seeing this miniature tribute to his films. The gore effects range from very amusing and gross shots of ""sicko's"" ripping apart innocent human beings in the most inhumane and gross ways. On such way involves a man having the skin ripped of his chest to reveal his ribcage. I guess you could say the inner demon came out of me at this time, which is why I enjoyed this aspect of the film.The acting was not actually that bad, I felt it was rather good most of the time and the dialogue was generally realistic, but was at times overdone to carry on the feeling of a B-movie. I think the best acting in the film would go to Freddy Rodriguez and Naveen Andrews. These actors managed to actually provide me with some enjoyment in this overall bad film. However some aspects of these characters were rather disturbing as Andrew's character seems to take some kind of satisfaction in collecting human testicles from men that have disappointed him in there jobs. I found this to be kind of disturbing rather than humours as I guess was the original intention by Rodriguez.Overall I would recommend this film for people who are; die hard zombie fans, Rodriguez fans, B-movie fans and of course anyone who finds unusual and weird movies such as this good. These people will enjoy this and I guarantee these people a fun, bloody and gory ride! Due to some of the comically yet graphic violence I would not show this film to anyone bellow the age of 15, as they may be disturbed by a man collecting human testicles, or even images of testicles melting which is also scene in the film. In conclusion I give this film a 3.2/10. Not good at all unless this type of film interests you.",Planet Terror

191,xThe_Fury,Planet Terror - A Movie Review by Brandon Krzysztof,7,12 August 2013,"Planet Terror, the film that made us all want to have an assault rifle for a leg. But if it came with the territory that is featured in this film, I'd have to decline.When a deadly agent hits the atmosphere and turns ordinary people into zombies, small groups find their own paths which is filled with surprises and come together at a local Texas barbecue restaurant to fight off the zombies. Their goal is all the same: survive this zombie apocalypse and find refuge somewhere.I have seen a few Robert Rodriguez movies and I'm aware of his style and this film fits right in. I'm not going to lie to you, this film does have a lot of corny one liners and over the top action, but it surprisingly works like it does in some of his other films. The film starts off pretty good, and yes I'm talking about the opening credits scene. Then from there it starts building suspense immediately and that is a strong point of the film. Throughout the film we don't see the zombies attack until about end of the second act while the characters deal with their own problems which again is a strong point.The dialogue is strong, the script is well made and gives a good ole zombie film that the audience will eat up and enjoy. The tone of the film is suspense, more suspense, and then an all out action thriller. It is more of an action zombie film than a horror zombie film; so don't going expect their to be creaky noises and character's investigating and then a zombie coming out and giving them a bite in the neck Resident Evil style. The score in the film was very good and played a role in building the suspense in the film.alternate text How do you think she fires the gun?In summary, I really think this is a well made movie. I loved to see some of the big names that made appearances in this film: Bruce Willis, Michael Beihn, Naveen Andrews (in the midst of his Lost days). Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino coming together and to make this double feature motion picture was great for the industry. They have been friends since From Dusk Til Dawn and it is nice to seem them collaborate. Even though I think that Quentin's Death Proof has the slight upper hand based on the deep dialogue and the performance of Kurt Russell. It's all relative, but both movies are good and I recommend both of them.

195,moldo_bmf,Better if you don't take it seriously...,7,2 October 2007,"If by reading the above title, you are still inclined to delve deeper into this review, then hold yourselves tightly because this is gonna get rough... The first and foremost reason why ""Planet Terror"" should in no remote way be taken seriously is mainly because it is a component part of ""Grindhouse"". For those of you unfamiliar with this term it basically means that this movie was never intended to be a blockbuster, a movie of epic proportions, or one of mediocre quality for that manner. It is just an homage to the hundreds of really cheesy, stupid and sometimes downright disgusting B-movies that have ever hit any screen, be it large, small, American or *insert your country here*. So, in this tradition, Planet Terror had to be as reminiscent of those productions as possible. This is the main reason for which PT is, for lack of a better word, stupid. However, in it's stupidity, exaggeration, and most of all majestic lack of any and all kind of logic, PT is entertaining and has a certain unique look and feel to it. If you don't have nay problem with any of the following: zombies that decompose in the most disgusting of ways (and let's not forget all of the guts, limbs, bodies and blood flying around), some of the most stupid deaths ever seen on screen, lots of bullets, seeing Fergie's brain get eaten, a chick who gets a machine gun for a leg and acting that is in no way even close to an Oscar-winning performance, then is definitely the move for you. My recommendation is that you go to your local cinema or rent this movie, kick back on your seat or couch, and start cracking popcorn like there is no tomorrow (that is if you think all of the sick things on-screen won't cause you any problems) and just enjoy some of the spectacular and hilariously stupid scenes in this movie.P.S.: Shooting zombies with all the kind of ammo you dispose of looks pretty fun. >:)",Planet Terror
196,badado,"Lots of gore, some laughs but no story",5,6 August 2007,"I had the chance to see the European premiere of the long version of the fragment ""Planet Terror"" at the Locarno International Film Fest. This was certainly an amazing experience since it was played on the unique giant screen of the Piazza Grande with more than 5,000 people watching. Also I was lucky to have Robert Rodriguez and Rose McGowan sat in front of me, after they introduced the film to the audience. Apparently Rodriguez was really excited to see his creature on that particular screen, reminiscent of the mytical US Drive-Ins. During the movie I catched him taping with his D-camera the audience and also some of the best scenes of his movie (like the final clash with Rose and her leg-machinegun).I must admit that this was a stunning experience.Audience was cheering as the movie appeared on the giant screen full with scratches and dusty sound. After the ""Machete"" trailer featuring Danny Trejo, ""Planet Terror"" started to rumble.I quite enjoyed the movie, though I found it sometimes repetitive and lacking of decent acting. Of course this is not a movie running for an Oscar but a tribute to Grindhouse movies of the '70 so we can forgive him that issues.""Planet terror"" doesn't add anything to the genre but it is certainly one of the best horror movies of 2007. Ultra-gore and ultra-splatter. Not to be missed by genre fans.Ado",Planet Terror
197,vdecaire,"""Two Against The World""",7,30 June 2008,"The first segment in the ""Grindhouse"" double feature features an array of characters fighting for their lives when rural Texas is suddenly engulfed in a wave of toxic gas that turns the unlucky to zombies. The (purposly) grainy camera-work is a achievement in cinematography; the cigarette burns and splotches in between reels is genius and adds to the fun of the entire movie, as in the whole drive-in theme of the movie. We've all seen these type of B-Movie films before, right? Wrong. Action and violence god Robert Rodreguiez teamed up with equal suitor Quentin Tarantino to create the most wild, heavy, funny, and super-loaded film of the year that's part homage to those B-Movie type pictures and also a rank on action movies ever made. The one-liners and, fittingly, over-the-top performances evenly weigh out the blood and guts that some may find excessive. Nevertheless, a great deal of romance is blended in the mix as well. Come on, have you ever seen a drive-in B-Movie style horror that doesn't throw in the sappy love to balance out the genre confusion a little. The characters are quite something and well put together... in a sense. A go-go dancer (Rose McGowan); actually the great heroine of the movie, is unexpectedly re-kindling her off-beat relationship with her ex when they are attacked by these creatures and she is stripped of her leg-- I won't say more, but I love the whole gun-for-leg replacement thing later in the film-- and the sensible hero Wray(Freddy Rodriguez) is hauled off by the sheriff for some reason. A husband-wife couple (Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton) who work together at the hospital are sort of cute. J.T.(Jeff Fahey), the Texas hick who is obsessed with creating the world's greatest B.B.Q. sauce ever, and is also the strained brother of the sheriff. The rest join them in hopes that the zombies won't get them in the year's best action/B-Movie/Zombie film. Don't miss the hilarious fake trailer for ""Machete"" before the film.",Planet Terror
198,pedrodebiasi,Throwback absurdity that uses budget to become trashier,9,7 April 2008,"While this could've been the perfect trash movie, directly appealing to the grindhouse concept it defends, ""Planet Terror"" has a relatively big budget, and some really nice visual effects and set pieces. So, how can you stick to the low-budget ideal without actually having low budget? I'm somewhere between finding myself surprised that Rodriguez trampled the paradox and understanding how he pulled it off, and writing about it will help a lot.Actually, there is only a small detail that doesn't count exactly as a flaw, but offers a bigger complexity than the movie aims for: the first part of the plot is told in a fragmented fashion, with many mysteries to be solved, some of which will be unveiled only in the end. Not a particular problem, since they converge to a completely trashy military-developed-deadly-virus story, but Rodriguez pays too much attention to these plot lines and twists, while they are but a excuse to place crazed characters, gore and absurd scenes - for an example, the revelation that Bruce Willis' character does in the ending is the most unexpected joke-twist since the watch in ""Pulp Fiction"".Wait, but isn't that what a bad movie is all about? Yep. No one ever said that ""Planet Terror"" aimed to be a good movie, with elegant direction, intelligent screenplay and thematic moderation. The thing is that what would be a flaw in a ""serious"" movie are just a reminder of how director and screenwriter Rodriguez managed to achieve great results. For an example, most of the characters aren't exactly complex, in the common use of the term, but they have so many funny aspects and lines that one can easily forget that they are almost comedic types. On the other side, the clichés are presented so shamelessly (the stupid blonde, the sacrificial dudes, the good guy hit in the last moment) that they turn into mockery.Sticking to the comedic, trashy feel of grindhouse movies, Rodriguez managed to come up with memorable moments, most of them starred by Cherry (Rose McGowan) after she suffers an amputation and gets her leg replaced by a machine gun (!!!), and here the paradox comes crashing down to a great asset: while scenes like a woman blowing up half a military base with her gun-leg are visibly complex and expensive, this is just the kind of idea that a filmmaker with little money and huge imagination would have. Only, this time, he has the money, and what we get are insane, physically aberrant action sequences that provides adrenaline and thrills in the correct measure. Rodriguez also heeds the call of gore, because, usually, much of the low budget of trash movies is taken to the fake blood department. Therefore, there are no clean shots around here, each bullet explodes in red syrup in the hugest exaggeration possible.Characters are also taken to extreme heights to become as bizarre as possible (and if Cherry Darling is not yet an iconic one, time will do her justice). Even with a girl with a leg replaced by a gun, Rodriguez doesn't stop and puts Dr. Dakota (Marley Shelton) in an even more weird situation - she goes through much of the movie with her hands numbed by her needles. Not only that, her needles soon become weapons in the most original ways possible. She and Cherry also share ""Useless Talents"", another of those genius ideas that only an indie filmmaker has the chance of putting on screen. Dakota's violent-husband-turned-into-boss-zombie, a barbecue man in search for the perfect sauce, a policeman that always shoots the wrong guys, a pair of demented twin babysitters and a nut-collector (!!!) biochemical engineer (!!!) are also present in this marvelous gathering of memorable characters.If some dialogs aren't particularly inspired, many others are present to give an extra flavor to the bizarre situations, and even a sex scene can become amusing just because of (well-utilized) ""fucks"" present in these lines. Whenever Rodriguez wants to refer to the self-indulgence of trash movies, he puts a particular eloquent tone to the lines, resulting in memorable phrases that stand out not only because they are smart and funny, but because they are spoken with a ""see-how-cool-is-my-line"" tone. Again, a usual mistake that comes to this movie as an asset that only strengthens the experience of watching a throwback low-budget film. The biggest asset of ""Planet Terror"" is using the extra million dollars to explore the grindhouse concept beyond it's past budgetary restraints, in a kind of modernization of the ""genre"".If this is what comes out of the mind behind ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Sin City"", then Tarantino and his ""Death Proof"" are probably another blast. And watching both in the theater must be a tremendous experience that millions of dumb North-Americans neglected, according to the box office results. I imagine that the grainy image is the reason for this fumble. Poor, poor them.",Planet Terror

In terms of comparison, i'd put it back to back with from dusk till dawn, replacing that films vampires with the afore mentioned zombies. Its just as over the top, if not a little more so. The only real complaint I have, is the little scratching noises, the parts that are supposed to look like they were over exposed, and every once in awhile, the card that would come up with ""scene missing"" on it. Yes, as I said I know this was all done deliberately, to make it look like a drive in movie, but it still became annoying after awhile.

How wrong I was.This film has it all; guns, girls and gore. Once the ball's rolling (if you get me) we have some pretty sweet action, with heads exploding, zombie shooting mayhem, and, if the poster didn't give it away, machine gun legs. Rodriguez never claims that the action is meant to be realistic, indeed some stunts are just impossible, but it just adds to the spectacle. Its definitely not for kids by the way.Although there are central characters, everyone gets their turn in the spotlight. There's humour, albeit dark, from almost all of them, and almost flawless acting. The plot is interesting and engaging, and its not often you can say that about a low budget horror/sci-fi.Although even I recoiled at some of the VERY GRAHIC scenes, they didn't take anything off the final product, the result being a shiny new movie that puts a whole new spin on the zombie genre.

Josh Brolin had a pretty good character, and the barque joint owner who is always working on his recipe is pretty good. Rose McGowan played a good character - the rest were just there for the explosions.There's a lot of action, but the people and the zombies die too easily.

Personally for me its the gorier the better. The chicks were really hot even though Rose needs to stop having plastic surgery or this might be the last film where she looks fit. Its going to be a classic, more so than Death Proof i think because it was much larger in scope. It was a real adventure, at least in this extended unrated version that i saw.

212,katana-t,Rodriguez is a Cervantes of Communication Era.,10,8 September 2007,"Planet Terror Rodriguez is a Cervantes of Communication Era.Cervantes wrote ""Don Quixote"" as a parody of the knights' novel but it was accepted as a philosophical drama, while Bertie (Rodriguez) wrote Planet Terror as a nice retro horror, but it is more like a parody of all horrors. Actually, the trailers were the same. You know, I, as many, was waiting for this child of the two brilliant minds (Rodriguez / Tarantino), I was reading absolutely everything concerning their project, and knew about the trailers.Gosh, I was talking about their project non-stop every time I saw my friends. They all knew where and when the shooting was taking place: wow, today Rodriguez has finished his part! Wow, today Tarantino is shooting in Austin, the traffic was blocked! Tarantino is looking for the girls in Sweden for his ""Cowgirls in Sweden"" (by the way, what happened to this trailer, I didn't see it)! The trailers, guys! I spent some time in St. Petersburg and there I was telling my friends and video-rentals' clerks about the greatest project of the decade that was coming to ""kill"".I was saying: ""The trailers of the movies that do not exist! You can imagine what a shame! How badly we would like to see those movies, - silly me  in reality it was better: they made trailers of the movies that you do not want to see, but the movies you watch very often. I mean myself here  hey, I love horrors, and I don't like the social irony and sarcasm that they spitted at us, at people who love horror genre. They showed us all the absurdity and dirt of such movies, I felt myself a total jerk, you know, but anyway, they did it well, those trailers' creators were good at putting people in their own sh*t, and yes, it was funny too, very funny  Nicolas Cage (Werewolf Women of) and that cop's phrase ""born"" to kill: ""It's blood"" (Thanksgiving), nice ""Don't"", very nice  it was us, horror lovers, so we are total jerks to these people, alright, I'm okay with that.Machete was absolutely Bertie style, you can find some references to Desperado  the scene on the top of the limo  his style is Mexican gun-show-off-style or simply Mexican show-off. He loves orange and deep yellow (especially you can see that all orange Spy Kids and Desperado), the colors of Mexican land and houses, I don't love them, I prefer calm colors  green, blue, light yellow, so his movies almost every time give me a feeling of discomfort. So, apart from that his movies are nice.So, back to Planet Terror, it is a joke. May be Bertie didn't intend to make it a joke, but it turned out to be one. You know, every time a brilliant artist does something he or she doesn't feel like doing, it turns out wrong. Their project failed. Bertie shouldn't have listened to his friend with that 70s idea: ""everything like in the 70s, equipment, the sets, all!"" This works for Tarantino, but for Rodriguez 3d and graphics works best (Spy Kids, Sin City). He was fine there, but no, Tarantino came up with that stupid idea, okay the idea was brilliant, but they couldn't make it right, because it was not Rodriguez's spirit  the 70s, it is Tarantino's, so working together they messed it up. I mean they messed it up for the box-office and the critics, but not for the history. Again, Planet Terror is a fine parody, practical joke about all that blood and guns stuff that we love. Poor plot line, mossy sets, dim lights and mediocre performance  that is Bertie's idea of the 70s movies. Who can blame him? He made a parody of all those sh*t*y retro and low budget horrors. A friend of mine, who wasn't trying to see it in general said: ""You know, it seems that they were stoned during the making of it."" Some people just don't want to see what's behind, or to see the bigger picture. That's why the movie flopped.Be that as it may, however, where is always on the top, where he is always a god, is music. Gee, I was watching the opening credits again and again, just to listen to the music, and the closing scene dozens of times. I don't know, his music makes me love the world I share with him. God personally gifted him the music, as he gifted Tarantino the dialogues.The movie, of course, is not one of those you want to see again and again  I pointed it out before  it is not smart  poor plot line and dialogues- it is not smart at all, may be it was intended to be so. Anyway, at least, I hope they had a lot of fun during the making of it, I know it. They do what they love and they love how they're doing it  that's bliss. I would say the making of it (including the writing of the scripts  they lived in one house while writing) was the biggest party in history  to make a double feature was good for the soul, - $67 million or so on having a good time together and with the Co. The two MOST brilliant minds of world cinema can afford that.",Planet Terror
213,Wherethefukawe,Tarantino in a sad parody of himself,1,12 February 2008,"""Planet Terror"" was a sad parody of Tarantino. The people who liked it are all guilty of ""the emperor's new clothes"" syndrome. The film was crap and people are so afraid of being seen as untrendy that they have to spout over the whole charade. The film was naked of merit - just like the emperor. And all those pretentious touches like the scratched film just showed that Tarantino is running out of ideas and is replacing ideas with gimmicks. He has such an ego and is so desperate to be at the ""cutting edge"" that he forgets that films have to be absorbing and entertaining. Blood and guts are no substitute for a plot and characterization. Both the Grindhouse films were pretentious rubbish. If Tarantino has lost his touch he should give up. Otherwise he'll just be remembered as someone who was pretty cool once, but lost it and never realized it.

214,mlopezib8,Incredibly funny,8,3 April 2009,"If some years ago Wes Craven decided to revitalize, parody and pay tribute to that subgenre known as slasher which had its highest moments between the 70's and 80's with Scream (1996), Robert Rodriguez decided not so long ago to revive that zombie-subgenre which prevailed especially after Night of the Living Dead (1968). One might think why Rodriguez would want to do that in the 21st century but deep in the end it's a logical answer. Nowadays, the zombie-movies have had their more sophisticated and elegant versions with films such as Resident Evil (2002) or 28 days later (2002) and Rodriguez seems to have wanted to contrast how the fear to an invasion of brain-eaters is reflected in two absolutely different periods of the history of cinema. By translating these differences, the Mexican director has made a movie which results incredibly funny to our contemporary eyes. Planet Terror is a feast of blood, black humour, and exaggerated characters and moments that made us laugh and wonder how things can change so much in not so many years. Not recommended to sensitive people, Planet Terror is definitely one of the funniest and enjoyable movies in the last years.",Planet Terror

219,AntoNEO,A deliberate guilty pleasure,9,20 October 2007,"While Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof seems to be a much more authentic representation of 1970s grindhouse pictures, Robert Rodriguez' Planet Terror is more of a loving caricature of 1980s zombie splatter films. Nothing in the film is played straight, and virtually every scene is accompanied by a wink and a grin at the audience.If Tarantino's effort is accused of being slow (or deliberately paced, depending on your opinion), Planet Terror never even thinks about slowing down. From the exploitative opening credits through to the final frames of the film, this is a roller coaster ride of a film that doesn't let up.With Planet Terror, Robert Rodriguez continues his ""everything and the kitchen sink"" mentality when it comes to his film-making by throwing everything at the wall just to see what sticks. While it sometimes feels like this technique gets in the way of Rodriguez finding a true film-making voice, it works quite well for a film like Planet Terror where there's no room for subtlety.The cast that Rodriguez assembled is a glorious ensemble of bygone action heroes, horror icons, and Rodriguez stock actors. They all bring their parts to life in a cartoonish sort of way that fits the tone of the movie beautifully.While the uncut DVD edition of Planet Terror doesn't change the film drastically in any way, it definitely improves the film. It gives the film smoother transitions and fills in some gaps in the plot (though that missing reel is still there and will always remain there as one of the many comical winks at the audience). The large cast of characters are also given more beats here and there that help fill out their personas a little more. All in all, this uncut version simply allows the film to breathe a little more, rather than having to jump frantically from scene to scene in an effort to make the 84 minute running time.At the end of the day, Planet Terror isn't going to win any awards, and it's certainly not meant to. It's simply an extremely enjoyable guilty pleasure of a film that virtually anyone with the stomach for it can probably have a good time with, especially if you're a horror fan. Take a couple of classic John Carpenter films like The Fog and Escape From New York and throw them into a blender with a couple of classic zombie splatter films like Evil Dead 2 and Dawn of the Dead and you've got a pretty good idea of what Planet Terror is like. And at the end of the day, you could definitely have a worse combination of films to pay loving homage to.",Planet Terror

Rodruiguez is back to form with his writing/directing. The script was funny and clever in its development of characters and the direction was OTT-goodness.The actors were sublime (QT the odd exception), and I reveled at each opportunity to see actors I recognized (John Connor!?!) redefining their images.The soundtrack was ace, Rodriguez can certainly compose up a storm and the other songs suited their scenes perfectly (See ""Too Drunk to F**k"").Overall, this is one fun ride. Make sure you don't miss it. Just ""Reach Up"".",Planet Terror
221,qy-2,Thinking about throwing the DVD away,1,17 October 2007,"I like zombie movies, and I like violent over the top movies. This one is filled with a lot of action, yet still can manage to bore the viewer to tears. It was horrible. Don't care about any characters. No plot to care about. It's all about grossing the viewer out without anything resembling a story.I am not sure what sort of movie to classify it as. There wasn't even one funny part in the movie, except how bad it was, not a comedy. So perhaps it was trying to be a horror movie, except that it wasn't scary, ever, not a horror movie. Lots of actions, but it was too boring for me to consider it an action movie. Heck, I recommend it for insomnia. I was almost tempted to throw it away before the movie was over. I guess if I had to describe it, I would say that it's a boring gross out movie if there is such a genre.",Planet Terror
222,nzxt,"""I think that I... found my award winning barbecue-sauce""",3,6 October 2007,"The thing about Mr Tarantino as well all know is that he is totally absorbed by paying homage to old B- or even C-movies. This worked well with ""Pulp Fiction"" with it's genuine characters, unchronological editing, surprising subplots and twisted ending. I used to rent a lot of those movies with it's regular stereotypes on VHS during the 80'-90'ths from the local video shop, I have never come across the worn-out picture quality that is suggested and just happen to be very annoying. I believe that Tarantino should have squirted some chili-sauce right on the script in order to add some suspension to the story! Everything is quite boring here with just some sexy hotties, a wooden Bruce Willis character and awful lot of grouse. Of course I have to laugh concerning the irony; a doctor gets freakin mad with his wife who is cheating on him, having a lesbian love affair. And yeah, funny enough with the wife's son who does not obey her about careful handling a gun, and instead he commits suicide! My opinion is that this attempt is a true insult to George Romero and his army of zombies!",Planet Terror

One of my favorite movies of all time to watch in the theater, it is filled with explosions, awesome action scenes, ridiculous characters, hilarious dialog, hot women, and tons of nostalgia. With reference after reference to old ""grindhouse"" flicks, you'd think the movie would be some kind of choppy amalgamation of tired tropes, and in some ways it is, but the movie somehow triumphs despite of it.

The movie in it self is more of an anti- joke.The movie style Robert is using in this one is more of a parody of a parody, do don't know what to make of it and is left with an amusing laugh. Personally it's one of my favorite movies of all time. There is just something about those corny one liners and bad physics in the CGI. Robert is a genius and should get more credit in his work. When i watched the 10 minute directing school in the extra material on disc two, in the DVD, i saw how simple he made each scene and how he formed it from only using cheap and good techniques.My ranking is:Cast: 8/10 story: 5/10 Directing: 9/10 Screen Play: 8/10 Effects: 8/10 Music: 9/10",Planet Terror

It won't make you ponder .You'll probably forget it in a week ,but surely it would have a deep-deep impact on a childish/young mind.Because of the violent scenes. It brings your imaginations of action to the screen.Its very very gory,bloody and the screen look,the 70s b-grade movie look makes it one helluva ride.Watch it late at night to get a little more of the juice . It has that 'ordinary Texas horror'element.Don't take it too seriously else you wouldn't love it. Bruce Willis and Michael Biehn do their usual .Not complaints though. Excess of blood and bloody scenes make it thrilling and shocking.Thats good. Its fast-paced.You'll be surprised at times on the gore and the un-timed comedy(thats what makes it funny and entertaining).Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are amazing anyway when they work separately and, when they're working together, they're better.Long Live you two.Cheers to horror and blood.You'll love it.On the whole Robert Rodriguez delivers a good and a 'filmy' (you'll see)film.Such movies come rarely.Enjoy.",Planet Terror

Bad and totally predictable script, poor special effects, unfunny dialogues and this aka 60's and 70's picture and noise all-time throughout = maybe somebody found it cool, but I am not. Rodriguez experimented with picture and sound a lot to make it looks second-hand and trashy. The only delight of this movie is to watch over Rose Mcgowan, because she's very attractive and beautiful. But she is all the same thru the whole picture. What's wrong with You guys? Do You think You are really creative people? No innovation, no creation = this movie is made for the kids on the block or for stupid American teenagers eating fast-food.

The acting was... well to be honest OK.I went into watching this with an open mind not wanting to compare it with zombie related subjects such as the walking dead , the dawn of the dead, etc.If you've nothing to do & you need to kill 2 hours & you cant really find anything better to watch...watch this, otherwise steer well clear.",Planet Terror

I watched Death Proof and Planet Terror because I was curious what Tarantino and his companion had created.As for Planet Terror I cannot see anything inventive about this movie. It seems as though Rodriguez has been watching numerous 70s Zombie and Porno C-Movies and put anything he found unintentionally laughable into this one movie: poor production (missing scenes, bad picture and sound quality, bad editing etc.), stupid dialog, nonsensical plot, big-titted girls. Alright then, maybe all these things were well observed and the movie buff will appreciate how - intentionally - bad this movie is. BUT, there is nothing original about this movie. This movie is supposed to be a homage, it is supposed to be art. It isn't art at all. It is just another C-movie adding nothing new. This is a 1:1 copy of grindhouse, the only difference is that it may be slightly more grotesque. If the fun of watching C-Movies is that they are unintentionally funny because of their flaws, why would one make another movie just like them?

237,tim_the_slipperman,One of the best films of 2007!,9,29 December 2007,"Grindhouse: Planet Terror is an excellent film in my opinion, with tons of action, suspense and dark humor. You'll have a lot of fun watching this installment in the Grindhouse franchise.The plot of the film revolves around a group of heroes, led by vigilante El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) and exotic-dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), battling an army of zombies transformed by zombie gas. Cherry loses her leg to a group of zombies, and later gets it replaced by an awesome assault-rifle that she uses to gun down both zombies and mutated soldiers alike. (The soldiers are supposedly mutated by what was intended to be an antidote to the zombie gas, but instead causes their bodies to become dependent on the zombie gas to remain normal, or else they begin to hemorrhage and eventually melt. Don't think about it too much - It sounds silly, but that's part of the Grindhouse experience!) With its all-star cast of memorable characters and a retro-active look and feel (including scratches and wear and tear in the film and even a 'missing reel' during which a building the survivors hide in somehow gets torched - again, the 'missing reel' pays homage to classic Grindhouse cinema), plus the awesome action-packed 'Machete' trailer (Robert Rodriguez should consider making that a full-length film itself!), Planet Terror is a treat for any film geek who enjoys B-horror/action films. It's a pity it never did too well in theaters (mainly due to overlength after getting packaged together with Tarantino's 'Death Proof'), but consider getting the Planet Terror DVD. You'll likely enjoy it.",Planet Terror
238,js_radford,Gratuitous crap,2,18 July 2008,"I loved ""Sin City"" - very graphic, compelling story, etc. But ""Planet Terror"" and the earlier movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" really disgusted me because of the totally ludicrous, incredible stories fleshed out in truly filthy fashion in the name of endless, gratuitous, festering crap.These movies and Robert Rodriguez's work of late are designed for pre-adolescent, obese and indolent morons with no concern for any integrity of script, credibility of concept. It's all T&A tease and gore. Utterly ridiculous. If I could I'd censor these pieces of garbage. Give me a break! But I'm no prude. I did find ""Sin City"" hugely entertaining without the endless gratuitous gore (though there was a fair bit).The ONLY reason to watch ""Planet Terror"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is for the unfestering female parts.

I classed it as a zombie flick and as such found it a good addition to the genre. To say it is the sickest (notice the correct spelling) film ever made shows a complete lack of cinema knowledge to the extent of idiocy. Anyone who has seen any of Rodriquez's previous work will not be in the least bit surprised by anything in this film and will probably enjoy as such. If you like the Horror genre, especially Zombies, which are thankfully making a return to cinema, you will find a special place in your dark and twisted hearts for this.

But then he comes up with a horrible and disgusting mess in Planet Terror. Why is he so attracted to zombies??? It was seen even in From Dusk Till Dawn, where the movie started brilliantly (with his pal Tarantino doing a good job as a psychotic killer)and then drifted to the Rodriguez favorite zombie theme.Planet Terror has all the ingredients that can disgust anyone - blood spilling, arms getting pulled out, stabbing in the eye ,etc,etc. I was bored within 5 minutes since the flick started with the stupid ""ball "" scene ruining it the most for me. Wonder why Tarantino allowed himself to be associated with this movie?? His segment Death Proof was pretty decent.Wonder how this movie is so highly rated on IMDb. The director must have some real good hackers in his team. There is no other way for it to be rated 7.5+. Deserves no more than 2 stars out of 100.",Planet Terror
244,vengeancelord2000,Planet Fun,8,14 March 2008,"Planet Terror? Okay... here we go. I hadn't really heard much about this movie, but was just in the store and spied this one. I was looking for (craving) A good, serious zombie flick, as I haven't found one I liked since the DOTD remake (28 Weeks Later being the closest thing). I saw the Rodriguez name and picked it up, my hopes high.While I wouldn't call it a ""spoof"", it is definitely not a serious zombie movie, and is over the top with gore, one-liners, and B movie classics.At first, I wasn't aware of its ""homage"" status, and was like WTF is this crap. I soon discovered what it was, and was a little bummed (There went the serious zombie movie I craved), but I gave it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did.This movie is just an action packed, fun, and frenetic thrill ride all the way to the end. It never slows down, and while it is over the top, its done with a style only Rodriguez or Tarantino could pull off.The quality wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't supposed to be, and although I was a little put out with the ""missing reel"", I thought the other effects (Like the film quality deteriorating as the zombies drew near, and the Screen going red when Tarantino's character starts going psycho) actually added to the atmosphere instead of detracted from it.The characters were just cool, and played by hard hitters like Tarantino, Willis, and McGowan. I have to say I was a little stoked to see Bruce Willis in this (And who better to kill Bin Laden than THE man, Bruce Willis) and Tarantino, and as bad guys to boot. The whole cast made the intentional ""bad acting"" look good.Zombies and gore? Check, and check, and in spades. While not technically zombies, they were close enough, and adequately disturbing. The gore? Everything from zombies ripping people apart in seconds, to wicked gun blasts, to mowing down zombies in a tow truck. Gore aplenty, and appropriately disgusting, especially Tarantino's nut-melt scene.While definitely not a date movie (If you meet a girl that disagrees, let me know, I want to date her.), and definitely not a serious zombie movie, what it definitely is, is a lot of fun. It's a movie to just grab the snacks, switch off the lights, kick up your feet, and get ready to go on a ride.While not the serious zombie movie I set out to find, there is only one thing I could say when it was over.That was f*&@ing cool!",Planet Terror

The odd juddering of the picture or the colours does not make it a really good mock-50's B-Movie. I found it to be pretentious, with the most ridiculous storyline I've ever had the pain of watching. If it had been done right it could have been good, but all it was was a series of utterly ridiculous scenarios and bad acting. It was just one big mess. No real storyline, not even any humour in it.

I'm not really sure there is a plot in the normal sense of the term. Yes, there is a story, but there is so much stuff thrown at you that you don't know if there really is a beginning, middle and end. It's kind of just ""here you go and start watching."" There are all kinds of famous people in this movie that gives it a big budget feel, yet the acting, the lines, the absurdity of it all definitely fits the low budget feel. Rodriguez shows you all kinds of camera tricks and special effects. I almost felt like my brain was being eaten while watching this movie (dumbed down). But, its great pacing, crazy scenes one after another, the over-the-top acting and lines and the cinematic sty-lings are so mesmerizing that I have give it kudos. Planet Terror even adds in some Bin Laden jokes that make it a perfect parody of our current planet and the reality of terror that exists in today's society.

247,anders_noer,Robert Rodriguez shows his incredible diversity,9,7 February 2009,"*** INCLUDES SPOILERS ***Being Director of Photography, composer, director, writer, producer and doing the editing for this movie, shows Rodriguez to be one of the most well rounded talents in modern movie making (being a force in this particular genre primarily). He seems to master all aspects of film making with relative ease and gets the look, sound and feel he wants. The end result is a very coherent and tight product. Quite a powerful display of craftsmanship and passion for film making.If gore is not your thing, you probably wont watch this movie from start to end. If you can stomach it, however, you will be well rewarded.Your ability to get the humour in this movie is largely based on your frame of reference. If you have no prior knowledge about, or love for, classic horror/gore movies, you're not gonna pick up on all the quirky and subtle inter-textual hints and references throughout this roller-coaster ride. Even those with no particular interest in former horror/gore should however find amusement in some of the dialogue which is cleverly tongue-in-cheek and at times outright hilarious. Especially Jeff Fahey's character (J.T)., Bruce Willis (Lt. Muldoon) and Freddy Rodríguez (El Wray) deliver some memorable one liners (El Wray's: ""I never miss!"" late in the movie, being a prime example). The plot is meant to be predictable, the characters are meant to be shallow, an occasional camera crane in the background is left there intentionally and the lacking realism serves to establish the setting and premise for the movie. Car's don't explode, a leg-mounted gun wont fire automatically, zombies don't exist, characters react unlike real persons etc. Rodriguez manages to honor (and at the same time ridicule) the last 50 years of horror movie making, entertain and gross out his audience while seemingly having great fun in the meantime.

254,Mellow-Fellow,I love the Zombie genre of films but this.... was awful.,3,18 June 2014,"First let me explain that I am a huge fan of Zombie Apocalypse type films and television, which one could easily classify in the same genre of science fiction which I am also a huge fan of. And it has always been up for debate amongst fans and critics of the genre how far you can bend the logic where logic does not exist rule without breaking it.This movie defies almost ALL logic. I understand it's meant to be a gore-fest shock thriller, and I can say Resident Evil would be classified as the same type film and I enjoyed any film out of that series twice as much as this junk, and I would put the best resident evil at about a 5.6/10. I know a lot of you guys out there reading this are shaking your heads thinking that I don't ""get it"". I'm not a film critic so I don't know the terminology but I understand the way Quentin Tarantino makes his films in a sort of comic-bookie fashion like this seems to duplicate, and I loved most of his stuff, kill bill, true romance, basterds, django. This does a good job of coming off as that type of film, even with the old grainy film markings and cut reel in sex scene.This just goes so far beyond logic that I couldn't simply ignore it and it ruined the entire experience for me. The toxin is airborne and most certainly extremely contagious, when we see Wray first enter the hospital to get Cherry he avoids the blood splatter, later on they are just running over zombies in trucks getting splashed in blood, were they immune somewhere along the line? how did the girl not get infected after losing her leg? the simple explanation by the wacko doctor just simply says oh some people are immune...OK.Then the LEG GUN, HOW DOES SHE FIRE THE AMMO AND RELOAD MAGAZINES? and at the end when it becomes a FUC**nig MINNIGUN where do the bullets come from? her tail? she goes soaring at least 30 feet in the air towards the end and pops off 100 rounds in every direction from what appears to be a 30 round mag in an m-16, I wasn't paying that close attention, then I counted at least 3 rocket blasts from her, one minute shes a stripper next minute shes a trained assassin that defies gravity and can somehow telepathically fire a gun from her leg. Hell I would have even settled for a string or something she pulled on connected to the trigger.I could list a dozen more points but i'm not wasting another minute of my life thinking about this, plus you guys already have your own high or low opinions anyway without me pointing out more of the obvious. I've never written a review and thought i'd be in for a treat with some of the actors and the 7+ rating and loving Zombie flicks, but wow what a disappointment. I honestly can not think of a worse movie at the moment. I think I saw something called tank girl late night SyFy channel that was pretty close to being this bad, but i'd rather watch that. HOW could you give this anything above a 4/10!!!!!!!?? -rant over",Planet Terror

256,oxiroxt-91642,Whoever edited this movie needs to be hung high,1,2 January 2019,"I can't enjoy, all the less judge other aspects of this movie because of these TERRIBLE edition overlaid artifacts aiming so unsuccessfully to resemble an old tape movie.It feels as if the editor just threw in the effect and thought that's cool enough without bothering to actually adjust any settings to make it look realistic.At the very least a reference movie should have been studied to check how frequent each kind of artifact is, and also how they're supposed to blend. I very much doubt this kind of natural artifacts is supposed to be overlaid fully opaque on the picture.Also while the color grading is on point with the style, I feel like there should be some color overflow/glowing/blooming to go with the aforementioned effect. Somehow the effect doesn't make sense on its own alone.I can watch all sorts of old movies with their natural artifacts no problem, but this one is unbearable and it's hard to believe it could have such a high rating.",Planet Terror

258,carnydrew@aol.com,"I get it, I just didn't like it.",1,10 March 2008,"The idea was to make a cool, fun, artsy homage to the grind house horror films of the 70s. I get it. It fails.The film is not funny, not scary, not exciting, and not particularly cool. The plot is standard zombie-movie. Nothing new or interesting here. Despite an impressive list of actors, the characters are not particularly interesting (Jeff Fahey's ""J.T."" being the lone exception).The violence is exaggerated and laughably cartoonish, but, since it is not funny or enjoyable, we have to questions the point. Of course, we should already know by now that Robert Rodriguez will be bursting plenty of ketchup packets. However, the gore (of which there is plenty) is neither disturbing nor enjoyable.Which brings us to the leg. Rodriguez must have really thought he had quite a gimmick here. He must have been trying to homage ""over-the top"" by going over ""over-the-top"". Once again, I get it; it just doesn't work.The ending is unsatisfying. I guess that is to be expected...maybe even true to the genre......this one is a waste of your time. Watch ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) instead.",Planet Terror
259,rogue_flight,Better than Death Proof,8,18 September 2007,"Everyone I know loves this movie, including my Girlfriend. Yes, it has it's gross-out moments, but they are all so over the top that they aren't all that disturbing. The whole movie is supposed to be grimy and cheesy so if you expect a slick Hollywood blockbuster you might be disappointed. If you are a fan of MST3K movies then check this one out. It's an amazing recreation of a movie they'd watch! I mean that as a compliment. I found Death Proof to be slightly Borning until the last 20 minutes. But, in this movie, it's almost all non-stop action! There are also some really funny cuts, dialog and special effects. This movie is not to be taken seriously. Turn down the lights, get some popcorn and enjoy the ride!",Planet Terror
260,spikemonkey3000-1,"""I Hate How Fake Hollywood Is..."" - Planet Terror Review",8,25 November 2007,"And, finally, it arrives. The second half of the Grindhouse extravaganza has finally arrived in the UK, with low marketing and little hype. No wonder it did badly in the 'States. The fact that it did is a real shame, as the film is a real blast. When combined with Tarantino's Death Proof, it could be a fun, indulgent, glorious event to be treasured. Let's just hope for a full Grindhouse DVD.One of the disappointments in the split was the question of the fake trailers - which film would they accompany? And would they all make it? Sadly, the answer is no. Whilst ""Machete"" makes it unscathed, the others will be probably be forever lost to UK audiences unless they find their way onto one of the DVDs. And when the trailers are as good as this, it's a shame that they don't feature. Whilst maintaining the tone of Grindhouse, it manages to complete the aims in 2 and a half minutes. With the incredible line ""They just f*cked with the wrong Mexican!"", it's no wonder it's been rumoured as maybe being made for a Grindhouse 2 - though obviously no plans have been finalised (and quite probably won't be, due to the fact that Grindhouse was, technically, a flop). Basically, it's lovingly made and well executed, a perfect way to ease the audience into the full-on feel of Planet Terror.Back to the movie - Planet Terror (a.k.a Grindhouse Part 2) is gross. It splats, it gurgles, it pops and oozes and drips. The first ten minutes include bio-chemical zombies, ball cutting and Bruce Willis, and it doesn't let up. Tension is, to be honest, fairly low, but luckily it isn't the desired effect from Rodriguez. The cheesy music and grainy look of the film is much more ""grindhouse"" than Death Proof (missing reels, corny soundtrack) and the tongue-in-cheek tone of the film is more leaning towards gross-out comedy shlock than downright terror. This keeps proceedings funny, sharp and always enjoyable, and means the film is more like the olden days, when posters promised more than the movies could provide.Whilst this may sound like a criticism, it really isn't. Planet Terror never tries to be more than it knows it is and wants to be. It gives sly reference to the war on terror, without focusing on it, and knows that its concept is laughable. The icky bits are suitably slimy, the weird bits suitably weird, leaving us satisfied, if not blown away, by the outcome. I mean, how many films do you get to see where Tarantino's balls drip (yes, drip) off? And Sayid from Lost holding a big jar of balls?This movie likes balls, and it's sure got some. It moves at a rollocking pace, Rodriguez amping up the action and laughs as the time whizzes by. The action is always fun, especially the final shoot-out (yes, with a gun-leg from Rose McGowan), and the characters hit exactly the right tone. Whilst the performances aren't always mind-blowing, they more than serve their purpose, especially Freddie Rodriguez as the insanely cool El Wray, who seems to be able to do things because he is El Wray. There are many parts like this, but Planet Terror feels no need to explain and justify its reasons.One of the movie's main attraction is its balls-out attitude, summed up when Rose McGowan emerges with a gun attached to the stub of her leg. She looks incredible, simply cool in the way that a hot chick with sunglasses and a gun-leg is. The fact that it's willing to base the whole movie leading up to the this scene shows its daring and inventive feel. The finale does not disappoint, with a very satisfying ending, yet keeping with the tone of the previous hour and a half.The direction isn't really anything special, Rodriguez focusing more on the feel and look of the movie than using interesting shot types. To say that it wouldn't fit the genre would be true, but Rodriguez need not worry - most people going to see this aren't going to nit-pick about the good-but-nothing-special direction rather than focus on what this movie's really about.And what is this movie about? Is it a subtle comment on our fears of nuclear bio-weapons? Is it an intimate view of small-town America? Or is it just a dumb excuse for slime, monsters and stupidity? Well, it's none of these. Planet Terror is all about having a good time, with comedy, splatter and action combining to a very entertaining, if not earth-shattering, movie, that can be accurately summed up (in tone and subject) by the line ""I'm gonna eat your brains and gain your knowledge""...So, who's up for a full DVD with both movies and trailers?Genre Value: 4/5 Entertainment Value: 4/5 Style: 3.5/5 Overall Rating: 4/5",Planet Terror
261,NonStopMark,Always keeps you interested in the next frame,7,12 November 2007,"I like the trashy Machete!! trailer on the front of this movie before the film starts (directed by the same crew). This sets the scene beautifully (for the style of the rest of the movie) and is like all those throw away video trailers you used to get when you hired a video out in the eighties and early nineties. Remember when you used to have to sit through a raft of cheap, straight-to-video film adverts. Watch out for it. I remember commenting to my mate in the cinema in Manchester (UK), 'Just give me thirty trailers like that one and I'm good for the next 90 minutes!!!'. The film is pretty entertaining and memorable and so scores higher than average marks. The violence is pretty over the top and so this stops it from being hard to watch in true comic-strip fashion. I like it when a film offers something new and this one pokes fun at all those old nasty zombie flicks in an original way. Went to see 'Shoot 'Em Up' a few weeks earlier which was a severe disappointment as it had nothing to offer but this cinema outing is a good pastime. You may or may not need to see it again but you will enjoy it for the time it is on screen that's for sure. Machete!!!",Planet Terror
262,kalle_taurus,Complete crap,1,17 November 2007,"To bad there were so many excellent actors in this crap movie. I can't understand why the move is so highly rated, it completely sucks, I'm almost angry. I guess it was made like this on purpose, but why? Was it meant to be made as a piece of art? My opinion is that it was a completely waste of time. I am a big fan of both science fiction an action movies but when I watched this movie I couldn't find anything that appealed to my movie interests.Bruce, why did you act in this movie?

I have seen some rubbish over the years but this one takes some beating with regards to rubbish. OK I am 48 years old but when my son of 21 and daughter of 19 both avid film watchers say the same we must be on the right track. Steer well clear of this one if you have an old video of Thomas the tank engine or Thunderbirds put this on instead. The cast are a bunch of unknowns to be honest (or they will be after making this movie)it reminds me of films such as killer spawn from outer space or attack of the 50 foot woman from th early 1950's. Oh well only my view on the film I am sure 1 or 2 people somewhere will enjoy it....",Planet Terror
264,charlieplayer,Embarrassing,1,16 October 2007,"This truly is an awful movie.You can see where the director has tried to 'Pay homage' to similar movies in this genre from the 70's and 80's but he fails in a terrible way.As with Tarrantino's other half of the set, should a new director have made a movie such as this (while attempting the same 'homage') they would be lucky to receive backing ever again.It's not to often that I am forced to sit through a movie just to comment on it but this was tortuous. I'd expect better from a skit on a Saturday evening show.Awful",Planet Terror
265,Jayrrh,Metalest Movie Evar,10,22 October 2007,"This is my second favorite zombie movie, despite the breakaway from normal zombie traditions.Perhaps the biggest warning to give would be that this movie is definitely not for the faint of stomach. It definitely pushed the limits of what directors are willing to put in a movie. Some of the gore was just over the top and unnecessary, such as the extremely graphic pictures of testicular diseases and the overall pus-filled appearance of the zombies.However, if one is a fan of splattery gunshot wounds, excessively dry and black humor, and overall badassery on the parts of many of the characters, I would highly recommend Planet Terror.A confession; I haven't actually seen Death Proof yet, but after watching Planet Terror and reveling in the campy gore and action, it's definitely on my to-watch list.Finally, a huge suspension of disbelief is crucial to enjoying this movie. If you don't like movies that don't seem real, don't bother watching this. If you have high moral standards, don't let your skin come into contact with the DVD. I actually bought the unrated version on DVD, and have yet to take advantage of the special features (in truth, I'm somewhat afraid to).The bottom line is that Planet Terror is a camp-filled zombie extravaganza that really cusses a lot and has a chick with a God damned machine gun (yes, with grenade launcher) on her leg. Who knows how she shoots it, but damn, it is impressive.Acting? Realism? Children not getting shot in the head? Those are things for more mainstream, less metal movies. Planet Terror is the most brutal movie I've ever seen.",Planet Terror
266,clqwrx,National lampoon presents: Planet terror,3,11 November 2007,"First of all, I felt really offended at times by this movie. Don't get me wrong, I personally love the idea of a cripple attaching a weapon to his/her severed limb (Ash of ""Evil Dead"" is a divinity to me). What was offensive about it is that it felt like Rodriguez was more dissing the genre and its fans, than paying tribute to it and them. The thing is that great Splatter movies are usually made on a low budget, but by people highly devoted to both the special kind of humor of the splatter genre, and the art of cinema itself. There are numerous examples of quite well-known gore flicks made by enthusiasts for no foreseeable profit at all, such as Evil Dead and Bad Taste. These movies are however always made to be all they CAN be. Shure there are usually goofs and plot-holes the size of grand canyon, but they are usually not deliberate, as they are in ""Planet Terror"". If you watch Rodriguez's ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" there is a perfect example of a movie made with love, to be all it could be.The ""missing reel""-gag made me really upset, since that was just insulting to the audience. You missed out on what could have been a good 15 minutes of important plot developments, and even though you catch on quickly, I felt cheated out of a piece of movie that would have been entertaining, and important. The camera work and the overall feel of the photo in itself was quite cool the first 15 minutes, but after that it started to get annoying and pretentious, together with the rest of film. After the hospital scene, I started to get a nagging feeling that the movie couldn't decide whether it should be a zombie movie tribute or spoof film a la ""Scary Movie"". However, the film was mildly entertaining, and had brilliant acting in some cases, especially by Josh Brolin as the Horrific husband doctor zombie, and had some scenes that could have made splatter movie film history, had it not been for them being buried in the sizable heap of crap the rest of the movie offered.Robert had the budget (and probably the imagination and skill) to make a truly incandescent addition to the genre, but he chose to emulate the worst crap of the genre. Thanks a bunch.",Planet Terror
267,xtribalx,Planet WHAT?,1,10 November 2007,"As usually I started with reading the cast list and I saw some good actors there as Mister Willis I thought this might be a good movie. The movie started out good and I sat on my couch and ate some popcorn with my wife. After a while I started to think. What the hell is this and it all just got worse by the minute. When Rose McGowan the one-legged lady got herself a new leg near the end of the movie I really had enough of this crap but since I already wasted that much time of my Friday night I thought I might as well see the end of this movie. It made me think of one thing and one thing only. Is Bruce Willis going broke or did he just need some extra cash for something?? Why is he in this movie? I understand why Quentin Tarantino is in this movie, it just is his kind of a flick. But WILLIS?!?!?! So for everyone that is thinking of seeing this movie. Don't get fooled about the cast list it's not a Willis kind of a movie it's more of a Tarantino movie. A disappointment and a waste of time.

268,snottsandstuff,Good But Not Great,7,11 December 2007,"Well, what can i say...... What a leg this film was, (pardon the pun) At first i thought zombie films were taking a turn down the same street but after the first half hour i didn't know weather to laugh or switch off. Apart from the constant action i was almost brought to tears by the bid for freedom on a mini bike. i couldn't stop laughing. the fact of the matter is, i haven't seen a film like this since the original ""Dawn Of The Dead"" which also had me in stitches. If anyone wants to see a well made horror flick with zombie creatures then i would seriously recommend ""Resident Evil Extinction"" or ""28 Days/Weeks Later"". However, If you are after a action packed monster movie with a Tarantino twist then planet terror is the one. Not only was there plenty of gore but in some places the characters were actually believable. The only thing i would mention against the film is the mobility of cherry. for someone who has had their leg removed and swiftly had it replaced with first a chair/table leg and then a M16, she seems to be able to get about just fine. with this said i would only recommend this film for people with a serious hunger for gore and a loose grip on reality.

The max you can do, some how shut your brain down, and just laugh on every possible movement of the movie. The story has nothing to do with reality or even since friction. The characters look completely unrelated to the plot or I must say, they are opposite to the plot. This is what makes them kind of funny. The action is quite good and at some part funny too which remind me about Hollywood Movie. The movie is much more like a spoof but the thing is that, you don't know, spoof of which movies.But still, I like specially the ending part, where army captain explain, how he killed Osama Bladen, the bike of Wray, when they want to take Cherry to the helicopter and she just raise her hand and get the rope in her hand.

No moral lesson to be learnt, no real logic behind its events and just a lot of action and gore which you basically get excited about without reason.Intended to be a B Grade movie, so you would expect the cheesy lines, stupid characters doing extremely risky things and later getting themselves killed but rather than shaking your head and yelling profanity at the screen i couldn't help but laughing out soft drink and popcorn.If you're looking for a deep story and reasoning behind every event which happens maybe you should watch this movie and chill out and learn to just enjoy some cheesy movies.",Planet Terror

Now, with some relish, I can say that I was wrong. After a second viewing a week ago I found the movie an infinite amount better. It's full of entertaining slices of comic brilliance as well as vast amounts of action, thrills and spills to keep you glued to the screen. It is well worth noting that this film was never meant to be accurate or realistic in any sense, and if you bear that in mind from the start then you'll love this movie as much as I do.Whilst it will not win any Oscars anytime soon, it is well worth seeing if you just want to have a fun and enjoyable movie experience.

Because there are not much films better than this. It looks like a zombie film at first, but it's more. It has enough comedy, sometimes horror or thriller and sometimes romantic(actually romanticism is not that much). It's camera angles and director's ability is another thing which makes this film so beautiful. It has a simple story but Rodriguez did great job.The cast is also very good. Freddy Rodriguez's performance is great but Rose McGovan is the person who we should speak. Her sexy performance is one of the factors for my 10 to this film. But it was easy role for her I think. Bruce Willis is also a plus for the film so is Naveen Andrews. I was shocked when I saw Tarantino on film but I'm glad that he played in this film.The only weak part of this film is it's ending I think. I don't want to tell it's ending but I was expecting a better ending from Rogriguez.

275,indijul,hilariously entertaining!,8,8 October 2007,While watching this film at the cinema I found myself enjoying it more than Tarantino's Death Proof even though I really loved DP and appreciate more Tarantino's body of work than that of Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez though really surprised me with his contribution to the grindhouse project. I couldn't stop laughing throughout many moments and scenes which were caustically funny as well as the dialogues. I love sarcasm and this movie makes perfect use of it. Another commendable aspect of Planet Terror was its gore and style which absolutely fit together and convey that satisfying feeling for every film-goer with cinematic experience. The anarchic humor and mad characters (I really want to highlight Josh Brolin's performance here which was most convincing for me) also contribute to the atmosphere which is just brilliant for this type of movies. Rodriguez's artistic effort is definitely his best one and perhaps most creative. People who take movies too seriously should avoid this one.,Planet Terror
