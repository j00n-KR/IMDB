0,Leofwine_draca,Dragging execution,4,22 May 2018,"LADY MACBETH is an example of another potentially interesting movie let down by a slow, dragging kind of execution that renders the whole experience quite the bore. It's about a repressed woman living in the Victorian era, who makes some dramatic changes in her life, particularly in regard to three men who come into it and affect her in different ways. The film has a simplistic plot and as such feels dragged out; it becomes obvious where this is going around the halfway mark and yet it takes an age to get there. Things merely plod along to the ultra-obvious climax that you saw coming a mile off. With a bit of life, vibrancy and suspense added to the story this could have been thrilling, and the actors are certainly effective at investing you in their lives. But overall this is more of a thumb-twiddler than a seat-edger.",Lady Macbeth
1,SnoopyStyle,great new performer,8,23 December 2017,"In a 19th century English country estate, Katherine has been forced into a loveless marriage with Alexander Lester. He is unable to consummate the marriage. His father Boris is a strict ruthless businessman. While Alexander and Boris are away, the estate hands have stripped black housemaid Anna naked to be weighted like livestock. She has a passionate affair with the aggressive new groomsman Sebastian.This is great emotional and physical brutality throughout the movie. Sebastian is the classic bad boy and Katherine easily falls into him. She is more complicated than a heroine in distress. Florence Pugh delivers a performance beyond her age. There is so much stoic power and defiance in her. What she does with the chair made me laugh in disbelief. One expected a shrinking violet for her character at the start but she is much more delicious than that. She is a creature of beautiful ugliness.",Lady Macbeth
2,Horst_In_Translation,The contagion of evil,6,23 November 2017,"""Lady Macbeth"" is a British 1.5-hour film from 2016 and this is the first full feature film by director William Oldroyd. It is based on a novel from the 19th century and for writer Nikolai Leskov it is probably at this point the most known adaptation of one of his works. Said adaptation comes from Alice Birch and for her it is the first career effort too, so really a great deal of ""rookieism"" to this work and for that the outcome is surprisingly positive. A lot of that has to do with lead actress Florence Pugh who was apparently only 20 when this was made and with her great portrayal here, I am genuinely curious what the future brings. I am positive we can expect a lot of quality from her in the coming years, probably decades. Her looks aren't hurting either. She really gives a defining performance when it comes to period piece femme fatale characters. I am glad to see this movie already received a great deal of awards recognition since its release. Looking at the first showings abroad at film festivals, it took far too long for this film to finally reach Germany.A lot of what made this film so good is what happens below the surface: the subtlety, the hidden and the characters' shades make it a strong watch. It's tough for me to believe that neither the director nor the writer have come up with a full feature movie yet. Extremely positively surprised as a consequence. Now I want to talk a bit about the title of my review as this stroke me as one of the film's most important aspects and biggest strengths. Of course we don't know much about the character of Katherine early on, but the way she was thrown into this world that was entirely new to her speaks for itself. Discrimination, sexism and physical violence against weaker people are nothing out of the ordinary. And the more Katherine is confronted with all this abysmal stuff, the more she turns evil herself. Her first killing is already not an act of self-defense at all, it is far more intentional than the second in fact, even if you can justify both to some extent from a psychological perspective, probably not a legal perspective. The second then is probably more gruesome, but also more on the spur of the moment and not really 100% planned. And well.. the infanticide? It shows pure evil as the victim is really 100% innocent, but I'll get to that later in detail. As for the contagion of evil, there is always a personal component to it and with the protagonist's love interest, that limit is reached when it comes to killing the kid as the guilt overwhelms him eventually and he has to let it all out, even if I somehow expected a suicide too. But he is the one who can be blamed the least. He may be boastful, but he is not rotten.And finally, another reference to the infanticide. It is the most shocking moment, but also perhaps the best moment because it shows how evil had totally conquered her by then. Graphically. And with that I don't mean the face, but I mean the fact that the camera position is in a way where we basically see her black clothes only and almost nothing of her head and it looks like a black spirit creature kills the boy, the personification of evil. Sure that's free to interpretation too, but it is what ran through my head that very moment. I also somewhat like films with realistic happy endings and I think from that perspective the film is a winner too because it did feel pretty authentic. Pay attention to how absolutely everybody is a loser here. Some died, some lost their privileges, some went to jail and the central character ends up alone, at least for a while, and she said at one point she hates being/eating alone, so the cat may be the only company to stay for her for a while. All in all, a good film with occasional moments of greatness. Yes it is sometimes tough to stomach, but without having read the book this is based on, I would say here we have the prime example of a film that proves that there are actually strong novel adaptations out there if you just approach the matter open-minded instead of whining à la ""no no all films based on books suck"". This one you really wanna see, a definite thumbs-up from me.",Lady Macbeth
3,Prismark10,A woman in a cruel world,6,9 April 2019,"Lady Macbeth is like a Victorian Gothic noir with more than a hint of Lady Chatterley's Lover.An adaptation of a Russian novel which is inspired by Shakespeare's Macbeth.The film is set in 19th century north east of England. Katherine (Florence Pugh) is a young teenager married off to Alexander (Paul Hilton.) He is much older than her, cold and maybe even sexually inadequate.Alexander is the son of a wealthy mine owner, Boris (Christopher Fairbank) who is brutish and cruel.Trapped in a cold, loveless marriage with only the black maid Anna as company. When both men are away, Katherine takes an interest in Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) a mixed race young estate worker and they have a passionate affair.When Boris finds out of the affair, Katherine does not shy away from what she has done. When Alexander returns, she flaunts Sebastian in front of him. Katherine becomes crueller as she desptaches both her father in law and husband.However both Anna and Sebastian find out that Katherine is willing to get more darker to get what she wants.Lady Macbeth features a mesmerising and beguiling performance from Florence Pugh. It is far away from these slushy chocolate box romantic period dramas. Katherine is steel edged and deadly.",Lady Macbeth
4,nogodnomasters,Face the wall,7,4 April 2018,"Katherine (Florence Pugh) is sold as a wife into the Lester manor. Her husband (Paul Hilton ) is delinquent in his husband duties preferring self gratification. She is told not to go outside. When the master leaves on a trip, we fall into an English version of Mandingo. Katherine is very bold and daring about her relationship and has no problem achieving what she desires. This is a fairly decent period drama. Fans of this film might enjoy the classic book Madame Bovary. Good use of silence. Guide: Nudity. Sex. 1 F-word. 1 C word.",Lady Macbeth
5,jboothmillard,Lady Macbeth,8,27 December 2018,"The film has no relation to the character from the play by William Shakespeare, it is based on the Russian book ""Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk"" by Nikolai Leskov, I had heard about it before I found it was featured in a new addition of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was looking forward to it. Basically set in 19th century rural England, in the year 1865, innocent 17-year-old teenager Katherine (Florence Pugh) has been forced into a marriage with Alexander (Paul Hilton), a man twice her age. They live at the estate of Alexander's father, Boris (Christopher Fairbank), who scolds Katherine for not giving Alexander a son. Katherine is forced to maintain a strict schedule and prevented from leaving the house, and when Alexander is home, his only sexual interest in his wife is limited to watching her naked and masturbating. One day, both Boris and Alexander have separate business matters to attend to, they leave Katherine alone at the estate, with only her housemaid Anna (Naomi Ackie) as company. For the first time in a long time, she is free to explore the area to alleviate her boredom. One day, Katherine catches Anna being suspended from the ceiling of an outhouse by the men who work on the land. One of the men is unrefined stable groom Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), who Katherine is attracted to, and she sets herself up to meet him the following day. Sebastian comes to the house to visit Katherine, and they begin an affair. Anna discovers the affair and informs the local priest, Father Peter (Cliff Burnett), he tries to warn Katherine about what she is doing, but she does not listen and sends him away. Boris returns home and is informed of the affair, he beats Sebastian and locks him in a stable, he threatens Katherine when she demands he is released. Katherine decides to poison Boris's food, calmly making small talk with Anna and showing no emotion as he chokes to death in the next room. Anna is terrified by what has happened and becomes mute, Boris is buried without suspicion, Katherine takes over the estate, and she and Sebastian openly continue their affair. One night, Katherine and Sebastian are asleep in her and Alexander's marital bed, she wakes to realise that Alexander has returned home. Alexander reveals he is aware of the infidelity, so Katherine summons Sebastian and they start to have sex in front of him. The three of them start to fight, during which Katherine kills Alexander, she and Sebastian bury Alexander's body in the woods and kill his horse. They are not directly accused or suspected of the murder, and Sebastian begins to dress and behave as the lord of the manor himself. A woman arrives at the estate and claims that Alexander had an affair while he was away, she brings with her a young boy named Teddy (Anton Palmer) who is the product of this affair, Katherine reluctantly lets them stay at the estate. Sebastian is angry at the change in the living arrangements, he returns to the outhouse, while Katherine has become pregnant with Sebastian's child, but she is unable to inform him. Katherine begins to bond with Teddy, but one day the boy disappears after Katherine scolds him, Sebastian finds him sitting over a waterfall and rescues him. When he returns Teddy to the house, he admits that he considered pushing him, Katherine dissuades Sebastian from leaving, promising to do anything he wants in return. While Teddy's grandmother is asleep, the couple use the opportunity to smother Teddy, Sebastian hides in the woods while she Katherine claims that the child died in his sleep from illness. Dr. Burdon (Bill Fellows) from the village is sceptical of the story, as his death is being discussed, Sebastian is ridden with guilt and returns from the woods to confess everything. Katherine however calmly turns Sebastian's confession back on him, he accuses him of lying and that he and Anna were the culprits for all the murders. The people in the household take her word over his, especially as Anna is unable to speak. Sebastian and Anna are arrested and taken away by the police, while Katherine is left alone in the house with her unborn child. Also starring Ian Conningham as Detective Logan, Fleur Houdijk as Tessa, Rebecca Manley as Mary, Golda Rosheuvel as Agnes, David Kirkbride as Edward, Nicholas Lumley as Mr. Robertson and Raymond Finn as Mr. Kirkbride. Pugh gives an extraordinary performance as the woman trapped in a loveless marriage whose psychology slowly changes and she drifts further into madness, Jarvis does well as her hapless lover, Hilton is good as the nasty husband, and there is great support from Fairbank and Ackie. There are similarities to the Shakespeare anti-heroine, an immoral character taking control, escaping abuse, but then doing unthinkable acts to get her own way, you don't know whether to sympathise with her or not at times, but that's what's clever, and it is accompanied by great location sets, costume design and a well-crafted script, a disturbing and highly watchable period drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film of the Year, and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. Very good!",Lady Macbeth
6,Quinoa1984,a wonderfully dark vision,8,26 July 2017,"Directed and edited with the kind of cutthroat artistic precision of the main character, this is a story of not feminist triumph but total feminist tragedy, and that beint cruel depends on ones point of view. This first time director (and God this actress!) do such wonders in getting us through the perspective of the character - the essential question ""whos pov is this scene supposed to be from"" is shown without equivocation in the first 15 minutes - that its almost TOO good a job. This film also has the interesting distinction of the tragedy of one character growing like a fungus on to the others; the one who seems to have more of an arc than anyone isn't so much the main ""Lady"" but the servant girl, who we can tell from just the small shards of backstory (much of that is on the face, a credit to how much this actress is IN this story and character, even when she is in the background of rhe room) has only known this life of servitude and its warped her in a way 'Lady' can never understand.It's also hard not to compare it to what else is out there now, and The Beguiled is a more emotionally varied, while still musty and murky and highly sexually charged, Gothic dramatic horror (its also hard for me not to think of parts of the Handmaid Tale series, would Lady function in that?) But this is remarkable and strong stuff, like tak8ng the stiffest, scorch-filled tumbler of scotch. I almost want to say this is a miserable experience, but everything about it l, from where the story goes so unexpectedly after the husband returns after being away for most of the story, to its ending that, for me, is readable as a tragedy for her perhaps more than those that get carted away to prison forever, is made with a level of intelligence and pain in its vones.Lastly its rigor that it struck me as something James M Cain could've whipped up while getting loose with a Bronte sister. Its almost a shame for me to say a movie I like so much in not sure I evee want to see again due to its coldness of soul.",Lady Macbeth
7,CinemaSerf,A woman scorned is... downright dangerous!,7,5 March 2021,"Florence Pugh is quite effective in this story of ""Katherine"", trapped in a loveless and sterile marriage with ""Alexander"" (Paul Hilton) who, with his father ""Boris"" (Christopher Fairbanks) treat her with a mixture of tolerance and contempt. The solution to her insatiety looks like it might come from their swarthy farm hand ""Sebastian"" (Cosmo Jarvis) and when the husband has to leave for an extended time, she discovers a sense of happiness and fulfilment that disbars any thoughts of returning to her former life of obedience and boredom - regardless of how dangerous that may be. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Scottish play, nor with any of it's characterisations so don't expect any similarities - beyond the fact that ""Katherine"" soon emerges from her fragile cocoon to become a determined - and dangerous - creature bent on securing her happiness and freedom at any costs. The one thing you will notice is the distinct lack of a soundtrack. There is plenty of pretty Northern English scenery to drink in, but when there is no dialogue (especially scenes in the forest) the only sounds we hear are of nature. The ending, i found particularly fitting for her by this stage rather unlikeable character and it is quite a telling depiction of just how completely ineffective 19th Century British policing was!",Lady Macbeth
8,writers_reign,"The Postman Is Ringing, Miss Julie",8,3 May 2017,"I haven't read/seen the source material which is either a Russian novella, a Russian play, or possibly both - a Russian play adapted from a Russian novella, so I have no way of knowing how faithful, if indeed at all, the film is to that source although it seems safe to assume that a minor Russian writer would hesitate to use Durham/Northumberland as a setting and Geordie speakers as characters. As my summary indicates the plot is a cross between Strindberg's Miss Julie and James M. Cain The Postman Always Rings Twice, both of which feature adultery and/or homicide. Florence Pugh has rightly been lauded for her performance in the title role and the camera-work is not far behind with setting after setting resembling paintings from the Flemish school. Not necessarily one to see twice but definitely worth one viewing.",Lady Macbeth
9,oscaralbert,"""White horse, white horse, ding dong ding . . . """,9,7 August 2017,""" . . . on the way home we'll Kill the King,"" goes an old English saying from the time of Robin Hood. Pretty much every film outfit doing business Today in Jolly Olde England collaborated to adapt this foreign tale of serf empowerment to the specifics of what they feel needs to happen in our current so-called Industrial Age, as Automation and Globalization combine to produce an all-time record amount of concentrated Wealth for a handful of Gluttonous Fat Cat One Per Center Oligarchs. Reducing Humanity's Current Plight to a single Fat Cat household sitting upon a Fortune derived from ""Civilization's"" most Deplorable means of murdering the Working Class--Filthy Coal Mining--Progressive heroine Catherine wastes little time in establishing a Template for Rebellion after being sold into an arranged marriage with the sexually perverse Lester Family. Catherine the Great swiftly poisons her father-in-law, bludgeons her husband to death with his own cane, guns down this drunkard's White Horse, and smothers his young bastard whelp with a pillow. The makers of LADY MACBETH are propagating the dictum to show no mercy to ANY Bluebloods (that goes for their little corgi dogs, too!). Just as the God of Israel frequently demands that enemy kids and animals be slaughtered right along with their Evil Masters throughout the Old Testament, LADY MACBETH preaches the Gospel of ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" if We 99 Per Centers are to have any hope of winning the war to reclaim our stolen birthright.",Lady Macbeth
10,evanston_dad,Too Restrained for the Kind of Story It Tells,6,7 August 2017,"""Lady Macbeth"" is like a Charlotte Bronte novel if the main heroine were a psychopath.Florence Pugh plays a young woman saddled with a marriage and an estate that she did not choose for herself, who gets a taste of what it is to give in to her own passionate urges when she shacks up with a hunky stable boy and then decides that she will have a life with him no matter what or who she has to eliminate to make it happen.""Lady Macbeth"" sounds dark and juicy on paper, and it could have been a fabulously lurid spin on the Victorian Gothic template, but as treated here it's far too restrained to take advantage of the pulpy subject matter. The whole film, from the direction to the performances, really needed to go for it and not hold back. Instead, it's too quiet and slow by half, and though Pugh does an admirable job, one can't help but wonder how much more memorable a character she might have been able to create had she been allowed to really go off the rails. Maybe an odd and random thought, but the whole time I was watching this movie I was thinking what a younger Naomi Watts could have done with it.Not a total misfire, but nowhere nearly as good as it could have been.Grade: B",Lady Macbeth
11,malcolmgsw,Arty rubbish,4,17 April 2021,"There is a very basic problem with this film,namely lack of motivation for the characters. No explanation of why the characters behave the way they do. Without this the characters actions are inexplicable and the director seems to be indulging in onanism. How on earth did this ever get made?.",Lady Macbeth
12,JamesHitchcock,Not the Scottish Play,8,15 May 2019,"Despite the title, this film has nothing to do with Shakespeare's Scottish Play. It is based on the story ""Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District"" by the Russian author Nikolai Leskov, which was also turned into an opera by Dimitri Shostakovich. The film, however, transfers the action from Russia to the north-east of England in the 1860s.The central character, Katherine, is the young wife of Alexander Lester, the son of a well-to-do landowning family who also appear to have interests in the coal mining industry. They live on the country estate of Alexander's father, Boris. (This Christian name, not a common one in Victorian Northumberland, was that of the equivalent character in Leskov's story. In that story the husband was called Zinovy, but the scriptwriter obviously felt that audiences would not accept this for a 19th century Geordie). Katherine's marriage to the older Alexander is a loveless and unhappy one, and she is bored and frustrated by life on the remote Lester family estate. When both Boris and Alexander are away on business she begins an affair with Sebastian, one of the estate workers. When Boris returns home and learns of the affair the illicit lovers are forced into taking drastic action.A storyline like that, combined with a 19th century rural setting, might call to mind the works of Thomas Hardy, but Katherine is very different from Hardy's heroines, who are generally portrayed sympathetically as the tragic victims of a hostile fate. When Hardy's main characters resort to violence, they normally do so suddenly and on impulse, as with Tess's killing of Alec D'Urberville or Boldwood's shooting of Troy in ""Far from the Madding Crowd"". Katherine and Sebastian, by contrast, are guilty of several premeditated murders in their attempt to cover their tracks.The last time I saw Florence Pugh was in ""The Falling"" when I felt that she was about the only good thing in that otherwise awful movie. To class someone as the best thing about a bad film might seem to be damning them with faint praise, but Florence has now shown that she also has the capability of being the best thing about a good film. She gives an excellent performance here, coping well with the difficult task of portraying a character who undergoes a speedy moral decline. In the early scenes Katherine needs to come across as sympathetic, the victim of an uncaring husband and of a social system which treats women as little more than chattels. In the second half of the movie, however, she must seem cold, heartless and scheming, as bad as, and worse than, the men against whose tyranny she was once rebelling. Florence receives good support from the rest of the cast, particularly Cosmo Jarvis as Sebastian and Naomi Ackie as Katherine's maid Anna who plays a pivotal role in the unfolding drama.Despite the Victorian period setting, ""Lady Macbeth"" does not have much in common with the familiar British ""heritage cinema"" style, which relies upon lavish sets and costumes. The Lesters, although well off, are not fabulously wealthy, upper-middle class rather than aristocracy, and their country manor has surprisingly little furniture and ornamentation by the standards of the Victorian bourgeoisie, whose tastes generally ran to extravagant over-statement rather than elegant simplicity. Possibly the elderly Boris has insisted on furnishing the house according to the simpler tastes which were prevalent in his Regency youth, but the austerity of Katherine's surroundings helps to emphasise the bleakness of her situation.Transferring the plots of the 19th century classics from one part of the world to another is a device I would more normally associate with Hollywood than with Britain, Alfonso Cuaron's version of ""Great Expectations"" being a case in point. ""Lady Macbeth"", however, succeeds where Cuaron's film failed. Cuaron relocated the plot of Dickens's novel not just geographically but also historically from early 19th century Britain to the America of the 1990s, and could only do so by twisting the story to such an extent that it no longer made a lot of sense. Leskov's story, however, works in an English setting, particularly in an isolated part of the north-east. Away from Newcastle and the industrialised south-eastern part of the county, Northumberland is the most sparsely populated part of England, and Katherine's home is in a remote lonely situation, cut off from the nearest towns and villages by endless barren moorlands, so it is hardly surprising that she feels a sense of isolation and alienation. (Relocating the story to, say, the more populous green fields of Hardy's Dorset might have worked less well).""Lady Macbeth"" is a grim but powerful and gripping drama. I had never previously come across the work of director William Oldroyd, but on this evidence he seems to be one to watch. 8/10",Lady Macbeth
13,lasttimeisaw,"an amoral, but incredibly cogent post-modern parable",8,4 April 2018,"Debut film from UK director William Oldroyd, LADY MACBETH is a perfervid reinterpretation of Nikolai Leskov's literature warhorse, which is transposed to a rural England in the 19th century. The young woman in question is Katherine (Pugh), on her wedding night, her mixed conjugal feeling of excitation, trepidation and expectation starkly plunges into blank disappointment by the standoffish maneuver from her much older husband Alexander (Hilton). Whereupon subjugated to a loveless marriage and the surface duty as a decorous showpiece by her martinet father-in-law Boris (Fairbank), who has bought her to marry his son, the headstrong, unsatisfied Katherine will turn seriously homicidal in securing her sexual fulfillment with a low-class groom Sebastian (singer-songwriter Cosmos Jarvis). While navigating the narrative's lean, frugally presented structure, Oldroyd vigorously charts the triple ""father, husband, son"" elimination procedures as the consecutive obstructions at loggerheads with Katherine and Sebastian's not-too-secretive assignations with unsparing directness and compulsive momentum, especially when ""the son"" chapter transpires, it wonderfully sheds light on both the raison d'être of this doomed arranged marriage in the first place (an imperative to paper over a scandalous miscegenation) and Alexander's wayward refusal to consummate it, everything makes sense at that stage, but Katherine has way passed the point of no return, and when her relationship with Sebastian festers under the duress of guilt, disgust and obviously, too much blood on their hands, Oldroyd goes off the beaten track to incarnate a revolutionary aftermath that empowers the birth of a nefarious woman, for which a society entrenched with feudal formalities and patriarchal superiority is answerable in every respect. Conceiving a neat and orderly strategy in arranging its puritanical but cunning period setting and sepulchral landscape (configured with a slender pick of incidental music), LADY MACBETH offers an immensely gratifying viewing experience, and preponderantly flourishes on the strength of its magnificent leading lady, the 19-year-old newcomer Florence Pugh, whose transubstantiation from a boredom-riddled virgin to a pertinacious temptress is utterly vivifying, and revels in her dexterous juggling with precocious impertinence, voracious desire and callous determination, all leading to that final flinty about-face which substantiates that she is here to stay, woe betide anyone standing in her way! Lastly, acting debutante Naomi Ackie also giving a heads-turning performance, as the obedient, tremulous housemaid Anna, who is the closest witness of Katherine's (wrong)doings, and ostensibly wielding the moral compass for viewers when she is seemingly stuck by a selective muteness, but in Oldroyd's acute refutation of self-imposed victimology, her abject, animalistic status (referred both by her superior and peer in difference occasions) is not a merit of sympathy, if she is unable to speak out the truth, she might just as well becomes a befitting scapegoat of this amoral, but incredibly cogent post-modern parable, the harbinger of a new name worth being reckoned with in the future.",Lady Macbeth
14,paul2001sw-1,Oddly compelling,7,25 January 2020,"'Lady Macbeth' is the tale of a woman lumbered with a monstrous husband and father-in-law who, driven in part by lust, sets out to do whatever it takes to get what she wants. Unlike her Shakesperian namesake, it's not her character who ends up consumed with guilt. The film features no background music, sparse dialogue and some of the key scenes occur off-camera or the action is filmed in a stationary and unmelodramatic way; meanwhile, the sex-drive is presented as absolutely elemental. The result is deliberately stilted (the opening minutes reminded of Joanna Hogg's work), yet for all that, suprisingly emotionally compelling.",Lady Macbeth
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It throws out any preconceived notions about 'rooting for the protagonist'; thus, nobody is empathetic.",6,6 August 2018,"There aren't really any 'likeable' characters in 'Lady Macbeth (2016)', nor are any of them even all that empathetic. While she starts out sort of sympathetic, our protagonist proceeds to slip so far away from being even remotely relatable, with things only becoming progressively - though, purposefully - worse, that it's hard to be invested even in her somewhat initially understandable but still downright dastardly doings, making her not so much an anti-hero as a part of a landscape of individuals either uniquely despicable or decidedly disposable whom we aren't really supposed to identify with at all. This is a prospect that may be intentional and quite distinct - perhaps, even, a little refreshing - but is still difficult to come to terms with considering that it negates proper investment and, by extension, any real engagement or enjoyment - which, in this case, you could still expect despite how dark things do get. However, the picture isn't without its merits, namely an apt construction and assured tone. It's never totally boring, just not entirely gripping and marred by a slightly lax pace. There's also a sense that not much has been achieved by its end, regardless of its thematic explorations and generally quite interesting, if ultimately very bleak, musings about equality (of class, gender, race and otherwise) as well as the consequences of a power imbalance - especially if it's violently turned on its head and the oppressed becomes the oppressor. 6/10",Lady Macbeth
16,gbill-74877,Watch it for Florence Pugh,6,6 October 2019,"The mood of the 19th century is captured well in the silence of this film, which for the most part is sparse on dialog and has little soundtrack. This allows us to hear all of those wonderful sounds of heavy wooden doors in the mansion, and the wind blustering in those beautiful open spaces of Scotland. Florence Pugh has an engaging screen presence and is one to watch for, though I'm not so sure I see the chemistry in the affair her character has with Cosmo Javis's. The story is mostly faithful to the original novella from minor Russian Golden Age author Nikolai Leskov (and one of his better works), but somehow it seems a little off here, maybe because her bored/dominated predicament segues to the affair/murder too quickly, maybe because the servant character (Naomi Ackie) isn't developed all that well, or maybe because the affair doesn't seem authentic enough to justify the actions, especially the last one.Compare these bits from the novella to how the scene with the line ""It's husbands and wives that kiss like that"" plays out:
""'Then why did you kiss me that way?'
Sergei said nothing at all.
'It's only husbands and wives,' Katerian Lvovna went on, playing with his curls, 'who shake the dust off each other's lips like that. Kiss me so that these young apple blossoms over us fall to the ground. Like this, like this,' Katerian Lvovna whispered, twining around her lover and kissing him with passionate abandon.""Followed later by:
""The old clerk, asleep in the shed, began to hear through his sound sleep, in the stillness of the night, now whispering and quiet laughter, as if mischievous children were discussing some wicked way to mock feeble old age; now ringing and merry laughter, as if mermaids were tickling somebody. It was all Katerina Lvovna frolicking and playing with her husband's young clerk, basking in the moonlight and rolling on the soft rug. White young blossoms from the curly apple tree poured down on them, poured down, and then stopped pouring down. Meanwhile, the short summer night was passing; the moon hid behind the steep roofs of the tall storehouses and looked askance at the earth, growing dimmer and dimmer; a piercing cat duet came from the kitchen roof, then spitting, angry snarling, after which two or three cats, losing hold, tumbled noisily down a bunch of boards leaning against the roof.""",Lady Macbeth
17,Reno-Rangan,There's no one to stand against her!,7,14 December 2017,"Based on the Russian novel of the same name. My first guess was it going to be a boring periodic drama. After knowing about the film plot, I anticipated a storyline just like 'Moliere', but what I saw was a dark and twisted tale. I was really surprised to see a film like this. Enjoyed it though. This is not a good film from the moral value aspect. But film is a film, sometimes it just depicts the real life, even it is a fictional, surely it would have had taken place without the world knowing it.Katherine, aka Lady Macbeth, a newly married young woman, but that's not an ideal life any couples want to live. Discarded by her husband, she finds a secret lover among the staffs of the house to satisfy her sexual urges. As expected, it does not go well when gossips comes out. Following the consequences, how the rest of the story unfolds was told with a series of twists.I liked simple settings. Maybe because it was a rural tale, but was so perfect. Florence Pugh has a potential to be a big star. The same goes to the director as well. This is her first film for me. She single handedly made this film look good. Not the year's most anticipated film, but definitely worth a watch. The Russian style British tale. One of the best films from such theme.7/10",Lady Macbeth
18,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,6,18 June 2017,"Overall, it's not a bad film, especially considering the performances. The story was okay too, with the intensity getting more development towards the end, when the tragedy climaxes. However, there were some parts of this film that were boring. The girl is bored, as she is locked in a house with nothing to do. And we can see her spent her days doing nothing, just sleeping and watching out of the window in repeat mode. At first, that was okay, as the film makers wanted to give us a taste of what her life was like and what led her to make the choices she did. But, after a while, it just got a bit tiring. The romance was kind of quick too, though, I guess, it wasn't much of a romance rather than a getaway from her boring lifestyle. So, her attachment to her lover was more of a paranoia over her lost freedom rather than a great love, and that could be figured out in the end. The performances were great as well, and the moody atmosphere were perfect with the dramatic factor of the movie. However, it just felt that it had potential to become even better than the final result. So, 6 out of 10.",Lady Macbeth
19,TheMovieDiorama,Lady Macbeth is a sumptuous tale filled with manipulation and promiscuity.,8,24 February 2018,"Well, I wasn't expecting that! A period drama I was told, a classy thriller I got. I can see why this deserves all the acclaim it received, it's absolutely stunning. A young lady lives a lifeless marriage, lacking a sexual spark. She embarks on a passionate affair with one of her husband's workers to which unleashes an unstoppable force for lust and power. I say unstoppable, I use that word lightly. My word, this woman is one manipulative puppeteer. Her ability to create deceit with ease, her authoritative power to control her workers allows her to get away with murder (quite literally...) and then her passionate affair paints a powerful portrait of a woman who gets what she wants. An utterly fierce narrative seizing female independence in a world dominated by men. What makes this film particularly more special, are Florence Pugh and William Oldroyd. The latter makes his directorial debut feature, exceptional might I add. Incredibly stunning segments showcasing the gorgeous landscapes of rural England and several static camera shots to allow some highly skilled one take scenes, particularly one moment involving a child on the sofa (extremely captivating and shocking...). Pugh commanded every scene, in fact the whole film was played through her fingertips. A tour-de-force performance, no doubt. Costumes and production were accurate and beautiful to look at, really captured the period age. The story itself takes a good third of the film to get going, but once one twist is revealed it just keeps spiralling out of control. By the end, I was hooked. My eyes were glued to the screen as we watch the lady of the house sit in silence. The silence really was piercing, very effective method I must say. Period settings may not for everyone, but I highly recommend you give this slow thriller a watch. Mesmerising and sensational.",Lady Macbeth
20,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The poise of a period drama clashes with a dark crime story in a strong filmmaking debut,8,25 December 2017,"Within minutes, ""Lady Macbeth"" sets a familiar period romance stage: a very young woman in 19th century rural England is sold into marriage to a cold fish husband and an even nastier father-in-law and in her isolation begins an affair with the stable groom on the family estate. We immediately sympathize with Katherine (Florence Pugh) and her desire to claim some free will from the clutches of a stifling patriarchy - and then the film starts earning its Shakespearean title.Director William Oldroyd's meticulous period mies en scene and portrait-like framing of Katherine's life and her ill-advised romance suddenly begins to unravel at the edges with some pivotal choices that create a jarring incongruity of tones. In an assured feature film debut, Oldroyd chilling tries to maintain the film's quiet, poise and elegance amidst the story's growing chaos and darkness.Adapted from Nikolai Leskov's ""Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,"" a novella released during the film's time period, screenwriter Alice Birch's choice to tell this story in England emphasizes its Shakespearean qualities and makes it more palatable for Western audiences. The film earns its lofty title by depicting Katherine's slowly rising ambition as she works desperately to maintain their illicit romance with Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) and the freedom that accompanies it.Like any story aspiring to Shakespearean levels, ""Lady Macbeth"" has somewhat of a three-act structure, only the ""acts"" are tied loosely together by Katherine's character arc - the conflicts and problems established early on do not swell in the way traditional stories do due to Katherine's decisive actions that change her circumstances. For a 20-year-old actress, Pugh gets a rare opportunity to establish dramatic prowess and comes off remarkably beyond her years. She embodies the clash of poise and passion Oldroyd aims for, often staying composed in body and voice while the story goes off the rails.The film doesn't sell us on its central romance, but the romance elements do reveal themselves to be ancillary to the film's actual genre - crime drama. Little about Katherine and Sebastian's relationship pulls us deeply into their situation and makes us feel more deeply about the choices they must make, but the film does sell us on their desperation and why they might feel as though they must do anything for each other. What at the onset we're lead to believe is a film about doing ""anything for love"" turns out to be more about autonomy and liberation.Class therefore plays a big part of the movie, and more specifically the power dynamics that come with it. For the first several minutes, Katherine has no power. She appears to have no more right to do as she pleases than the servants on the estate, including her handmaiden, Anna (Naomi Ackie), who is black. When we see Katherine and Anna in a scene together, however, we watch Katherine exert her power as lady of the house and watch Anna struggle to take any action of her own volition, a privilege that her position does not allow her - and one Katherine takes for granted.These different class and power dynamics give Oldroyd an opportunity in the camera's framing. Cleverly, when a character moves out of the frame, rather than cutting to a new angle, he will maintain the existing shot and allow the character to break the frame. In a few key spots, this accentuates the class distinctions and highlights their critical role in how the story unfolds. Whereas Shakespeare was into doling out extreme consequences for extreme action, ""Lady Macbeth"" takes a different route with resolving the story's ever-mounting darkness that has its own chilling effect. It makes ""Lady Macbeth"" into a decisively more modern film in that it's more interested in choices than morals. The story's roots in the hallmarks of classic literature, however, do keep the plot rather simple and put more onus on Oldroyd to create something engaging and new out of familiar ideas. He does that to enough of an extent that ""Lady Macbeth"" deserves notice.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Lady Macbeth
21,paul-allaer,Rousing telling of Lady MacBeth (Russian style),7,4 August 2017,"As ""Lady Macbeth"" (2016 release from the UK; 90 min.) opens, we see a young woman (we later learn her name is Katherine) getting married in what looks to be 19th century England. On her wedding night, she is left untouched by her (older) husband. Her father-in-law, also living there, is equally unpleasant. Katherine is utterly lonely and depressed. Then one day, both her husband and father-in-law must go out of town for business. It's not long before Katherine strikes up a torrid affair with one of the groomsmen. At this point we're about 10 min. into the movie. What will become Katherine and her lover? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: you may think this is yet another movie adaptation of the Shakespeare play, but in fact this is based on the Russian novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District by Nicolai Leskov. I will leave it to the Shakespeare experts to comment how different this story is from Shakespeare's. What I can say is this: the movie is very much story-driven. Things happen, and happen fast, and it doesn't let up! There is hardly any music in the film. Another unusual fact: the movie does not have a title. There are no opening credit, and when the end titles start, it simply says ""Based on Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District by Nicolai Leskov"", and that's it. (The Katherine character is regularly referred to as ""Mrs. Lester"" or maybe that should be ""Leicester"".) The star of the movie for sure is Florence Pugh, an up-and-coming British actress, whom I can assure you we will see plenty more of (she reminds me of a young Kate Winslett). Played by Pugh, Katherine is passionate and ruthless. Last but not lest, the movie was filmed (according to the end titles) in Northumberland, the area just below the border with Scotland, just beautiful.""Lady MacBeth"" premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival to positive buzz. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (4 people, including myself), which does not bode well for this movie, considering it was the opening night. That's a shame. Maybe this will gather a larger audience through Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. If you like a strong story-driven movie with great acting, you could do a lot worse than this particular ""Lady MacBeth""!",Lady Macbeth
22,subxerogravity,Really like this one.,8,17 July 2017,"The set up looks like some thing that would normally bore the hell out of me but that was not the case with Lady McBeth. The whole pace of the movie was set up well and the acting in it was brilliant.It feels like one of those straight up adaptions from some play or something. I don't know if that was the case. Also reminds me of another movie made about the same time period, the Beguiled. The contrast between the two films is how raw Lady McBeth is, absolutely no flash.So a young woman is force into a loveless marriage where her husband dislikes her and is sent away for a long period of time. In that time she has an affair with the stable boy and they go through dramatic lengths to keep seeing each other.At first I thought this movie was going to be filled with feminist elements to go hand and hand with the period the movie is coming out in, and technically it is but just not in the way I had imagined. The true concept I'm seeing here has mostly to do with the advantages of privilege and how easy one can get consumed by it if you have it, and screwed by it if you don't.Overall, the beauty of the film is showing how truly ugly some people can be, and doing it in a way that's exciting and colorful rather than making me turned off.http://cinemagardens.com",Lady Macbeth
23,kirbylee70-599-526179,Mcboring,1,23 October 2017,"LADY MACBETH is not to be confused with the Shakespeare play MACBETH. Instead this film is based on the 1865 novel ""Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District"" written by Nikolai Leskov. The film itself judging by reviews is either one you love or hate. Place me somewhere in between in that confused and bored category.The story revolves around Katherine (Florence Pugh), a young woman sold into marriage to a man twice her age named Alexander (Paul Hilton). From their wedding night forward he may sleep with her but never attempts to consummate their marriage. Instead he is a controlling tyrant who insists that she disrobe for him each night before bed and constantly tells her to stay indoors.When an accident at one of the businesses his father owns calls him away, Katherine immediately begins to disobey his wishes, walking the grounds as she chooses. Her only companion is Anna (Naomi Ackie), a servant who obeys her master but answers to Katherine.One day Katherine catches the farm hands have hoisted Anna up in a canvas saying they are trying to weigh her. Katherine forces them to let her down but is intrigued by what she saw. She tells the ringleader, a new groomsman named Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) to guess her weight upon which he lifts her in his arms.Apparently this is all it takes as the two begin a shameful affair spending most of their nights in bed together. When her father-in-law returns he attempts to set her straight on how to behave. The end result is his being poisoned with mushrooms and then Katherine and Sebastian return to the carnal encounters. As a result of the master's death Anna loses her ability to speak.At some point the inevitable return of Alexander is bound to happen. What transpires from there is something best left for those who make the choice to watch the film. If you are not among that group then my suggestion would be to seek out other reviews as someone is bound to make it common knowledge.For me the film was as detached from emotions as Katherine was when the film began. Taking place in 1865 it has that feel of a Gothic romance novel without the Gothic castle location or the actual romance. Instead that is replaced with lust and physical contact. Imagine Heathcliff and Catherine romping around in bed, remove the romance and you'll get the idea of what I'm talking about here.While watching it was easy to note the style being used with little or no music to interfere with the story. The dialogue is kept to short sentences when used. The décor is true to the time period with little extras to be found in the house and the costuming is the same. This might lend itself to realism but it also tends to add to the boredom as well.The performances are there with little that is exceptional. Of the characters it is Pugh as Katherine that has the most to offer here but her outlook and behavior is so dour that the changes in her personality are unexceptional. The change from purchased wife with a frigid husband to full on adulterous tramp is hard to believe. Those that love the film view this as an attempt at combating the patriarchal system of the time, a liberation of the female character from her surroundings. I say if you view it that way then you're more pretentious than you should be.I've never been fond of movies that attempt to create deep ""art"", normally finding that if the attempt is being made then the odds are the results will be a grandiose attempt to create something that doesn't actually exist. A recent blurb describing another film said something to the effect if you have to explain what you just watched then the movie wasn't very good. Movies like this, where the goal is to make a film with supposed deeper roots than are on display, fail miserably at what they set out to do. True art in film more often comes without the intent of it being so.Perhaps there are other out there who will enjoy the film and I say good for you. As for me it was difficult to stay awake and watch. Compound that with the early scenes of Katherine being told to disrobe by her husband, watching an actress in a role that requires her to do so and then considering the furor over Harvey Weinstein and his behavior and it just leaves you with a bad feeling.",Lady Macbeth
24,Pairic,A vein of macabre humour runs through the film but this is a tale of class and the subordinate position of women in 19th Century England.,8,7 April 2018,"Lady Macbeth: More Dark Gothic than Horror. Not based on The Scottish Play, rather it is an adaptation of the Russian Novella Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District by Nikolai Leskov, which was inspired by the character Lady Macbeth from The Scottish Play. (Phew!) Directed by William Oldroyd with the screenplay by Alice Birch.Rural England, 1865, Katherine is stuck in (literally) a loveless marriage, confined to the home. Her husband is nasty, brutish and short with her. This is indeed a Patriarchal household as her father-in-law rules over the abode and family treating his son as a lackey. This contempt is passed on to the servants.When both her husband and father-in-law are away on business Katherine starts an affair with Sebastian, a stablehand. This is discovered by the Patriarch, violence results and a series of events are set in motion which can only end in tragedy.A vein of macabre humour runs through the film but this is a tale of class and the subordinate position of women in 19th Century England. There are blasted Heaths but no witches. Murder, mayhem and poisonings but no battles. Katherine lives up to reputation of Lady Macbeth.

29,maurice_yacowar,Suppressed wife revolts against gender and class restrictions,9,17 August 2017,"There is no music over the end credits — and hardly any during the drama. Director William Oldroyd provides no musical relief for this bleak drama about a woman's liberation on a remote 19th Century English estate. The tone and the tale are stark, as befits a drama about people's for and against power.The film examines three areas of power struggle: gender, class and race. The most obvious is Katherine's growth from her husband and father-in-law's ""property"" into a defiantly independent commander of her own body, house and fate. The film opens on her wedding but as we don't see the husband it could as easily be her communion. She is isolated in her apparent innocence and submission. On their wedding night he orders her to strip, then turn to stare at the wall as he masturbates behind her. While taking his pleasure he denies her everything but humiliation. Where her mother taught her to enjoy the outdoors, her husband forbids her leaving the house.When he doesn't order her about his father does, an even more powerful and unfeeling brute. Both by gender and money the two men control the girl they bought along with a piece of land ""not fit for a cow to graze upon."" But when both men are called away for a business emergency Katherine discovers some freedom.In the scene where Katherine first discovers her power all three areas of struggle converge. She finds the estate labourers tormenting her black maid Anna, stripped and slapped about on a sling on the scales. Privileged in gender and colour, the men can freely debase her. When Katherine stops the torment she asserts her power in her husband's earlier terms: She commands the men face the wall while Anna retrieves her clothes and flees. Katherine's relationship with Anna provides the key to the heroine's ambivalent development. When she stops Anna's humiliation she may seem to be sympathetic to her despite their difference in class and colour. But her sympathy is qualified by the sexual arousal Kathrine feels from the scene, especially when the coarse groomsman Sebastian estimates Katherine's weight by sweeping her up in his arms. Though she fights him off and reasserts her authority over him, her sexual awakening leaves her vulnerable. When he visits her bedroom later her initial resistance gives way to their sexual attraction and she pushes him onto her bed.From then on Katherine is dominated by her sexual liberation. She is like the dog, straining against her leash because ""The bitch has been pent up too long."" She is the exuberant aggressor in their sex scenes, regardless of their class difference which scandalizes the estate and the community. In contrast, the cat agilely negotiates her interior empire, leaping for the spoils left her but remaining scrawny and hungry.Anna's gender connection to Katherine gives way to her submission to the castes of colour and class. Her sympathy for her adulterous mistress is frozen by her fear of disruption. In the tub she brushes her mistress violently. When the father-in-law interrogates Anna about the missing wine, Katherine sits by silently, letting Anna be humiliated over the wine Katherine drank. Anna is rendered mute by her punishment in that scene. The father-in-law orders her to leave on her hands and feet, reduced to a dog. Not the sexually liberated one associated with Katherine, but the humiliated beaten servant. When Katherine revolts against her father-in-law, she orders Anna to sit and eat with her, violating her every instruction. She keeps Anna from going to the locked door to help or to admit the dying old man. Anna never speaks again, not even when she is challenged to deny Katherine's final claim that Anna and Sebastian committed her murders. Having disposed of her two tyrants, Katherine is visited by a black woman and her young grandson, fathered by Katherine's husband and formally declared his ward. Their presence is a new obstacle to her affair with Sebastian. After they murder her husband, his horse and then his ward, Sebastian can't sustain his lover's will. His class and its submissive conscience compel him to admit his and Katherine's guilt. By now Katherine's new-found heat reveals a commanding cold. Affecting grief and innocence, she claims Sebastian and Anna committed the murders. When the boy's grandmother consoles her, Katherine's story holds sway. Anna and Sebastian are carted to the gallows. Like Shakespeare's tragic heroine, this Lady Macbeth is destroyed by her own attempt to transcend the limitations and disregard imposed upon her. She frees her heat, then to survive reveals the brutal cold of the woman prepared to exploit her sexuality, class and colour to survive. in this story a bitch in heat becomes a cold-hearted bitch. But the backdrop of privilege that has abused and restricted her at every turn shows her rather the victim than the villain in this transformation. Her success is bittersweet. She appears to have ""won."" But her lover and maid are doomed, her servants have left and she is pregnant alone. In the last shot Katherine resumes the posture assigned her throughout her career in ""her"" house, formally perched, corseted and alone, on a hard seat in her husband's cold sterile estate. Having shaken off her shackles she remains imprisoned in her husband's estate, like the useless land he bought with her.",Lady Macbeth
30,rockman182,Lady Macbeth (2017),7,5 September 2017,"I saw the trailer for this once before seeing The Beguiled and couldn't help but think that there was something mesmerizing about the film. Maybe it was the catatonic and hard stare from relative newcomer, Florence Pugh. Or the fact that I was craving a fine historical period piece. When things pan out like that its always nice. After watching Lady Macbeth, I am quite content with the film. Its not perfect and the characters are quite despicable but the film evoked a strong reaction at least, which is good.The film follows the life of a lady of the house named Katherine Lester. She's in a loveless marriage with a Lord. He goes away for a period of time, and in that time she conjures up a sexual relationship with a man who stays at the outhouse named Sebastian. When news of their affair gets out both parties become murderously complicit in grizzly acts all to protect their secret. The film is set in late 1800 rural England as well. The first thing that comes to mind is that it is a fictitious period drama that is more erotic in nature than contemporary films.  The film also draws parallels to Lady Macbeth. Lady Macbeth gains power through her husband and becomes complicit in a murderous rampage of tyranny against those who oppose her and try to take away her title. In a similar way Katherine is determined to hide her affair. Things go to far though and her character unravels.She's not an innocent character at all but vile, cold, and with psychopathic tendencies. No one in this film bar the maid is enviable or identifiable as they are all on the lower rungs of humanity.That is not a bad thing. Its nice to see a film where the lead isn't a proper Lady but only in appearance. She's quite treacherous beyond her beauty and will sell anything out just to save her own skin. Florence Pugh was very convincing in this role and I expect to see more of her in the future. Overall, the film suffers slow pacing and does lack focus but the set + costume design and the wickedness of the characters keep the film going. Its worth a watch.7/10",Lady Macbeth
31,joebloggscity,Seductive tale of self-destruction and survival....,8,15 June 2017,"This film really creeps you out. When it begins I thought it was some kind of Lady Chatterley's Lover type movie, but it isn't (thankfully). Our lead is Catherine Leicester who is holed up in a remote stately home tied up in a loveless marriage which is suffocating. When the cats away the mice will play, as the husband & father-in-law disappear due to work commitments, and she finds erotic solace with a stable hand.From there, she opens up but things are to take some disturbing turns. She isn't though one to easily empathise with, as her treatment of her loyal handmaid shows quite clearly. Catherine Leicester is quite an unpleasant character.This film has various non-white characters, the stable hand is black as is the handmaid. I watched 'Get Out' last week, and so this is two movies with racial themes, but this film doesn't really make any points as such, more what we create ourselves from what we see. If they had used 'white' actors/actresses in the roles, we would never have noticed a huge difference, but does add a contrast.The film is clearly an adapted play, and is shot in limited settings. It's very well made, quite sumptuous often to look at, but very dark too.The story is cruel in many ways, even the love is more sexual than really heart-warming.It's interesting and has great themes.

37,rubenm,Lust and loneliness,8,17 April 2017,"If I were the producer of this film, I'd have chosen a different title. I'm sure lots of moviegoers are going to be misled: this film has nothing to do with Shakespeare. It's an adaptation of a novel by the Russian author Nikolai Leskov, set in early 19th century England.The film seems to be a pre-feminism manifesto for women's rights. It shows Katherine Lester, the submissive wife of a wealthy but abusive landowner, living in a secluded manor in the British countryside. During a prolonged absence of her husband, she rediscovers her freedom and starts an affair with one of the stable boys. Not willing to give up her newly acquired status, she starts a series of increasingly extreme actions.The interesting thing is how Katherine evolves from victim to culprit. She seems to have learned from her husband how to use and misuse power. The lack of social conscience of which she at first is a victim, becomes a driving force for her own behaviour. Her selfishness and lack of morality is so extreme that, in the end, she betrays innocent servants. The viewer has to shift his allegiances: at first, it's impossible not to sympathize with Katherine, enjoying a free life without her heartless husband. But halfway through the film, it becomes clear that Katherine is just as heartless, as soon as she is in power.The story is filmed in a very effective, sober style with beautiful cinematography. The lack of any music is remarkable: some elongated scenes are striking because of the silence. The oppressive atmosphere in the manor is emphasized by the camera work. The camera repeatedly shows scenes from exactly the same viewpoint. Four or five times, we see the servant Anna entering Katherine's bedroom in exactly the same way.As much as 'Lady Macbeth' is about gender, it is also about class. It is striking that Katherine, who as a woman is considered a lower form of human life by men, herself considers the servants to be a lower form of human life. She shamelessly uses them for her own purposes and enjoyment, but doesn't care at all about their fate afterwards.'Lady Macbeth' is a beautiful film, about issues that even nowadays are worth thinking about. But I would have named it 'Lust and loneliness' - after all, it's set in the same period as the Jane Austen novels.",Lady Macbeth
38,CineMuseFilms,a shallow darkly Gothic tale with Shakespearean pretensions,6,6 July 2017,"It is usually a fail-proof formula for British filmmakers: gorgeous 19th century costumes, lavishly detailed period sets, and an angel-faced murderess who eliminates her oppressors. The film Lady Macbeth (2017) has the right ingredients but the whole barely rises above its parts. Apart from its classic title, this darkly Gothic adaptation of an 1865 Russian novel has no connection and bears no resemblance to the works of Shakespeare.Like many literary works from this era, the storyline is linear and predictable. Teenage bride Katherine (Florence Pugh) was sold to an older man and is now trapped in an oppressive and loveless marriage. Dominated by both her husband Alexander and live-in father-in-law Boris, Katherine is forbidden to go outside the house and must exist as an adornment, reading her bible and tolerating abuse. When the men go away for a few days, Katherine experiences such simple freedoms as walking in a field on a sunny day. She encounters a brash young farm hand Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) who later forces his way into her bedroom and they become lovers. All of Katherine's senses are ignited and she is determined to rebel against her wardens. Her affair becomes known and one by one she coolly despatches her tormentors. When she is accused of murder she frames Sebastian and the story concludes with evil triumphant.This is a visually well-crafted period drama but not one of its characters is more than a two- dimensional caricature. Although beautifully photographed, the characters are devoid of inner beauty. Stilted performance style and minimalist dialogue may work well as a stage-play but it struggles to translate comfortably to the modern screen. Silence is used to heighten tension but it mostly amplifies the emptiness of Katherine's life and the shallowness of the narrative. For example, the reasons for her mistreatment are left unexplored, and her apparently limitless capacity for cold-blooded criminality left unquestioned. While the normally expressive Florence Pugh gives a mostly convincing performance, at times she appears bored and emotionless and even in the lovemaking scenes conveys an air of wishing she was acting in a different film. As the 19th century was not known as one of feminist sensitivity, the original play most likely was a study of an evil woman's potential to disrupt the social order. In the modern era, the issue of female empowerment is more nuanced and intelligent than we see explored in this film.It may be that applying modern cinematic expectations to a Russian classic is unfair. When it was first performed in Moscow, legend has it that Stalin stormed out and condemned the work for ""tickling the perverted taste of the bourgeoisie"". The very of thought of a woman taking control of her life through multiple killings must have terrified the power elite. In that context, Lady Macbeth may be a solid work. But serious drama today expects more depth of characterisation and complexity of narrative interpretation. On these measures the film tends to underwhelm.",Lady Macbeth
39,david-meldrum,An Excellent Drama With Quiet Power And A Remarkable Florence Pugh,8,26 July 2020,"Frances Pugh is the gravitational force of this film; not simply filling the role, but her presence consuming the other characters, the building to which she is confined for most of the film and the shots she inhabits even when silent. In that respect, it's a performance that reminds me of Glenn Close's brilliant turn as the central character in The Wife, a role and film that have more similarities to this than one might first think. That's not to say her performance is greedy - far from it, it has a remarkably understated power; and the rest of the cast act without ego, with great subtlety to all how her to shine in the way in which her role demands. The purpose of the title is only occasionally and vaguely apparent for much of the film, but comes into horrible and brilliant focus in the final act; it's a title the central character earns. But it's the silences that haunt the most and lend this film its creeping power - the background silence of a stately home in the middle of rural northern England; the silence of the house itself; the silence of key characters; and most of all Florence Pugh's silence as she fills the screen, motionless and noiseless in a series of near but not quite identical shots that punctuate the film like refrains, lending a quiet kind of awe to the devastating ending.",Lady Macbeth
40,markgorman,It's Grim up north,7,30 April 2017,"I'm not familiar with the Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk short story by Nikolai Neskov (not to be confused with Lady Macbeth by William Shakespeare) which he wrote as a novella in 1865, although it is inspired by the famous play.the book inspired Shostakovich to write an opera based on it.Now we have a British film that feels incredibly French (incredibly Michael Haneke, who I think is actually Austrian) to add to its cannon.It features a career defining performance by Florence Pugh in the title role; although the men are magnificent too (most notably Christopher Fairbanks as the intolerant Father in Law).If you like Christopher Fairbanks through his Guardians of the Galaxy fame this is not the movie for you as it moves at glacial pace with very little dialogue, virtually no music and a LOT of fixed frames where you are invited to enjoy the cinematography in its most bleak and spartan Northernness.""It's grim up north"" might have been the poster slogan for this movie because, set as it is near the North East of England's colliery land, albeit on the moors (North Yorkshire I'd suggest), it is most certainly grim.The story is murderously grim too and I'd expect this BBC Films production to be in the running when next year's BAFTA's are handed out with Florence Pugh a shoe in for best female actor.Slow but sublime with excellent direction from William Oldroyd.",Lady Macbeth
41,euroGary,Worth watching,7,25 November 2016,"My enjoyment of the first fifteen minutes of the 2016 London Film Festival's showing of 'Lady Macbeth' was spoiled by the large numbers of people arriving late and causing disruption as they tried to find their seats in the darkened cinema. For Heaven's sake, make an effort to turn up on time, people!Anyway, having got that out of my system... Katherine (Florence Pugh) is bought, together with a piece of land ""not fit to graze a cow on"", by wealthy mine owner Boris (Christopher Fairbank, forever remembered as Moxey in 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet') as a wife for his son Alexander (Paul Hilton). But when both Boris and Alexander (the latter having failed miserably in the bedroom department) are called away, Katherine, left alone in a house full of servants, catches the eye of groom Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis). We then have a quick canter through the old 'woman half-heartedly resists arrogant man' plot (which to me always carries an unwelcome whiff of 'when a woman says ""no"" she really means ""yes""') before Katherine enthusiastically submits to Sebastian's straggly-bearded charms. (And why wouldn't she? Describing his participation in the gang assault on her maid as 'weighing a sow', he's plainly a keeper.) But if Sebastian thinks he is getting things all his own way, Katherine soon proves the shoe is on the other foot...Whether the audience were supposed to laugh I am not sure; but when we did, we were laughing with the film, not at it. Certainly the matter-of-fact way Katherine proceeds on her rebellious, seductive, murderous way had an element of black comedy about it; it was only her shooting of a horse that caused horrified silence (remember, this was an English audience). Pugh does well in making Katherine neither a wild-eyed lunatic nor a Hannibal Lecter-style psychopath. As her maid and unwilling accomplice, Naomi Ackie also provides nice work.How close this is to the source material - a Russian novella written in 1865 - I do not know. I found the maid's sudden muteness a mite convenient, since it meant she could not tell on her mistress; and Sebastian's change of heart was hardly unexpected. But this was an interesting film and I will probably watch it again if it turns up on television.",Lady Macbeth
42,augustian,The same old cliché lets the side down,3,15 April 2019,"Not to be confused with the Shakespearean character, this Lady Macbeth is Katherine, a 19th century wife in northern England who is left to run the estate after her husband and father-in-law are called away on business. The loneliness is well conveyed by the slow pacing of the film as Katherine sits alone in the house and the cinematography which captures the isolation amidst the open moorland. The lack of music adds to the bleakness of the situation as do the echoes of Katherine's footsteps in the house. It is no wonder that Katherine seeks passion in the arms of another man and goes to desperate measures to keep her freedom and the film takes on a very sinister form. However, it is the speed with which the affair begins.It is the same old cliché we have seen many times before - a woman resists a man but he only has to give her a kiss and she is putty in his hands. James Bond did it with Pussy Galore; then there was Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara and I an pretty sure that other leading men such as John Wayne and Robert Mitchum have done it with their leading ladies. One would have thought that in the 21st century, that old idea would have been laid to rest but apparently not; or maybe I don't know women. That, for me really let the side down and I do not think the film deserved many of its plaudits.",Lady Macbeth
43,lucasnochez,Film Review: Lady Macbeth/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,26 September 2017,"""To the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky"". Something wicked this way comes, yet, for a very large portion of the beginning of the film, that wickedness is never really fully defined. As the film opens up in 1865 rural England, we are quickly introduced to a stunning yet bleak beauty Katherine (Florence Pugh). Katherine is on the alter on her wedding day, but don't get this twisted, this is not your typical Hollywood wedding. Katherine was purchased with the land, a land that is apparently ""not fit enough for a cow to graze upon"" according to her growly and aggressively harsh, and newly appointed husband Alexander Lester (Paul Hilton). As the events of Katherine's marriage unfolds (and these events do not take long), we find her in the bedroom of her husband's home, naked, ashamed and facing the wall, while her husband pleasures himself in the corner of a chair beside a fireplace.Lady Macbeth is an extremely erotic film with very impotent moments. First time feature director and veteran theatre director William Oldroyd fills each and every one of his scene with numerous cuts and various edits to allow the film to flow; almost as if, unlike theatre, being able to change pace, time, space and movement on screen is something he becomes overly excited with. Yet, with Oldroyd's excitement with the film medium, he is able to show Katherine's quick plight with her new husband.Upon Alexander's departure from his family home, which is never revealed to Katherine, our protagonist is found bored, dumbfounded and lost in a home where she has barely any authority or purpose. With the exception of her very loyal maid Anna (Naomi Ackie), the land-hands, including one very undisciplined new farmhand Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), Katherine finds little motivation to get up in the mornings.After an extended period of time away, Katherine dreads the company of her husband's father, Boris Lester (Christopher Fairbanks). Aggressive like his son, the elder Lester is a constant reminder of Katherine's misery. Feeling claustrophobic in the home, tired with boredom and restless, without ever being able to leave the property, unless otherwise advised, Katherine must spend her pointless days inside the home, with her prayer book and inner thoughts lingering.It isn't until one day, that Katherine, who hears a commotion in the workers lodge, that she finds Anna stripped naked and being taken advantage of by the workers. In a rousing display of power, Katherine orders the workers to stop, and demands Anna get back inside. It is in their quarrel where Katherine first takes notice of Sebastian, and the two share very intense and disarming looks. Days pass, yet Katherine and Sebastian cannot forget their gazes upon each other, a desire that, is more animalistic, and very empty of love. Coincidentally many days later, on a very abrupt stroll in the fresh air away from the property and by herself, Katherine runs into Sebastian in the countryside, where she runs off avoiding and tempting herself. It is not until later that night, in a very swift, almost intrusive and forceful display, Sebastian visits Katherine in her bedroom, and the two young and attractive individuals engage in a very taboo love affair.While the actions of Katherine and Sebastian lust begins to unfold, an abundance of mostly evil and murderous events unfold along with them. With each new day that passes, the two vow to always be loyal to one another, despite having the world against their every action and notion. Treading the fine line between beautiful, loyal, sickening and morbid, Sebastian and Katherine quickly start unveiling the true motives of each other's love, allowing the audience to see that passion, physical lust and deep-rooted longing and desire are very well the driving force of a tainted love between two very inexperienced and uneducated people, especially when it comes to the subject of love. There is no point, at any moment in Lady Macbeth where the depictions of Katherine's and Sebastian's love affair are beautiful or attractive, actually, the opposite is easily said, where when each of these lovers are together, a truly grotesque display of affection can easily be felt.While Lady Macbeth is by no means an awful film, events and moments in the film are quite disturbing and awful indeed. The loss of innocence can be seen throughout each frame; the troubling interpretation of a protagonist in the film is quite unsettling and most of all, sometimes, the film seems to drive plot and its narrative, all too conveniently.While Oldrody's first feature film will surely be discussed and studied in academic settings for many years to come, the film begs many questions of femininity that, while it may be understood before even watching the film, can be questioned once the film's credit's roll. One cannot be disturbed to place Katherine's actions, either in the category of strong female lead, or monstrous antagonist. Does being a manipulative murderer, still make you a likable female character? I guess, upon discussing with my colleagues, the answer is yes, especially when strong and sly male characters, like the James Bond's, the Jason Bourne's and the Ethan Hunt's can all still be beloved cinematic protagonist's; especially when they are killing the bad guys, right? While many will argue that Alexander Lester is surely a bad guy, does the end justify the means? Is femininity defined or justified by ""an eye for an eye"" mentality? Is this a revenge thriller disguised as a period drama or vice versa?",Lady Macbeth
44,bastille-852-731547,"Superbly Well-Made, Chilling Period Drama",10,24 July 2017,"This small independent film from the United Kingdom is an astonishing portrait of the bleak realities of how Scottish culture viewed class, race, and (especially) gender in the nineteenth century. The film does this without ever needing to be preachy or overtly politically correct. It is very dark and rather disturbing, and it will get under your skin--but it is brilliantly made. It is the best film of the year so far. It should also, however, be noted that this film is not an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth."" Rather, it is an adaptation of a Russian novel about a woman who begins to exhibit deranged behaviors after being forced into an arranged--and loveless--marriage.Despite using minimal set pieces and little music, the aesthetics of this film are truly sublime. They add to the simple feel of the film, rather than the extravagant sense of many period dramas. The costume design is also simple rather than outlandish or flamboyant. Once again, this makes the film feel realistic and tense, rather than removed from reality. The film's cinematography is top-notch as well, reflecting the dark tone of the film in its entirety. Florence Pugh is exceptional in the lead role as Katherine. Despite the actions that her character commits in the second half of the film, she manages to generate sympathy while still portraying herself as a twisted individual--almost an impossible trick to pull off. But what elevates this film to utter brilliance is that it is not solely a defense of her--or a defense of anyone. Rather, it is simply a unique reflection on the notion of social status at the time period that skewers all preconceived notions of judgment--including morals and morality--to the point of ambiguous analysis. The film's true messages are quite complex, even though its direct plot is not difficult to follow. This is why even simple, dialogue-free scenes such as moments when the camera stares at Katherine's face as she is seated, tell you so much about her as a character and her mood to a degree that I have not really seen in any film of recent memory. Such complexity, though, is what makes the film an unforgettable watch. (Of course, the uniquely simple look and feel to the film and its excellent, slow-burn-style pacing also contributes greatly to it.) Recommended to the highest degree. 10/10",Lady Macbeth
45,trans_mauro,A Feminist Masterpiece...,1,16 June 2017,"... meaning that, in the view of modern society and even more modern (sic) feminists, women can be as vile, depraved and evil as any male serial killer around and that those qualities are seem as pluses in modern women.Well, of course, this disgusting example of torture porn and aberrant behavior was lauded by the critics as a great film, because, as we all know, critics, have a preference for films depicting humans in their worst, killing each other, lying, destroying lives whatever. In other words, critics love human garbage.To be perfect, in the view of those so called critics, a film like LM was missing something more avant-garde such as showing LM having sex with a horse, practicing cannibalism (she kills a child), acts of incest, etc.This is a revolting example of what the so-called modern intellectuals appreciate. Only those sick of mind can appreciate LM.",Lady Macbeth
46,ReganRebecca,Riveting!,8,22 August 2017,"Despite being filmed mostly in staid long-takes Lady Macbeth is incredibly riveting, a neo-Victorian film that gets just about everything right. We first meet Katherine (played by Florence Pugh, the ""Macbeth"" of the title) at her wedding to a man about twice her age. On their wedding night, instead of sleeping with her, he looks at her naked body and then goes straight to sleep. Katherine's husband, despite being twice her age, is somewhat of a meek man, kept under the thumb of his even bullying father who likes to bully Katherine as well. Eventually these two men leave, one because he has no sexual interest in Katherine, the other to punish her with isolation, but left to her own devices Katherine finds life in the remote manor serves her quite well: she is free to sleep, walk and eat when she wants, and most importantly she also has the freedom to strike up an affair with an insolent serving man.Despite the staid nature of the piece filled with corsets and repression the movie has plenty of sex and violence, used to great effect. Every actor among the small cast is also incredibly fantastic here. It's hard to believe this is director William Oldroyd's first feature film because he has such a controlled and beautiful vision. One of the details I especially appreciated is that he includes more than one black character in the film, something that adds depth and subtext to what happens later in the film as it goes from a mediation on feminism to a meditation on racism and all without the film overplaying its hand or becoming didactic. A must see.",Lady Macbeth

48,RMurray847,"A slow burn of a film, but has a great performance from its young star",6,8 January 2021,"Please note, this movie is not some sort of treatment of Shakespeare's play or character. It is, really, just a short cut way of letting a potential viewer know they are about to encounter a cold, calculating woman who will literally stop at nothing to get what she desires.We first meet Katherine as she is getting married in one of those cold, stone English churches. We find out quickly that she has essentially been ""sold"" to her new husband, a gruff, grubby farmer/landowner in what I'd guess is Northern England in the 19th century. They don't know each other and they have no relationship. And he's not exactly a doting husband. He tells his new bride (who looks to be in her teens...the actress, Florence Pugh, was 19 at the time of filming) that she should confine herself to the house. Her new father-in-law, and even rougher and crustier version of the husband, tells her the same. He admonished her for not producing an heir...something that will be tough, since her new husband does not sleep with her. He clearly has some hang-ups, and his new wife is of no real interest to him, so she pretty much spends her days just sitting around, waiting to eat her next meal and later, to go to bed. She has no friends, but an odd sort of relationship develops with her maid.Anyway, early in the film, while her husband and father-in-law are out...she begins to wander the land around the farm. And sure enough, her husband was right to fear her wandering, because she meets a rude, coarse but sexy farmhand, and begins a torrid affair with him. She enjoys herself quite thoroughly, and apparently doesn't care who knows it. They make loud, unmistakable noises in the house. The community begins to get an idea of what she's up to. (There's an amusing scene where the town minister pays her a visit for tea, encouraging her to spend less time outdoors, and more at church. Apparently the fresh air in this part of the world turns women into animals!!) So, Katherine begins to encounter obstacles to her being with her man.The movie delights in showing us the extreme tactics she takes on to get what she wants. And she has no moral brakes that we can see. Her passions are cold and calculated. Watching Pugh take on this character is a blast. We see her mind working. She's constantly observing, assessing and taking action based on her observations. She manipulates. She will stop at nothing, and towards the end, there is a shocking scene during which I though...well, I've never seen this depicted on screen quite so disturbingly.This is a slow burn of a movie. The sex scenes are passionate and energetic, but brief. Everything else moves at a stately pace. This is not an ""action"" movie. It has moments of humor, certainly, but the entire film has a dark cast to it. The lighting and the bleak land help...but so does Pugh's understated (but somehow juicy) performance. The film has a few unanswered questions (what's up with the maid?) and ends at a point where we feel there's more story to be told. And while we can clearly read Katherine's mind, the other characters are most cyphers. In a way, this reinforces the notion that everyone else is being seen through HER eyes, and those eyes don't much care what's going on in the minds of others...BUT for the audience, we'd probably like to know a little more about the other folks in this world.But overall, I found the movie to be a treat to watch, and the story was certainly quite different. Some themes were familiar, but I've never seen them played out in this manner. Certainly worth a look.",Lady Macbeth
49,marydm-43470,Totally unconvincing,2,1 April 2020,"Florence Pugh is the flavour of the month and she is often referred to as a force of nature. That may very well be so, but Lady Macbeth, whatever the original Russian story was, is a film without the slightest conviction. She is sold into marriage into a wealthy family and from day one proceeds to bump off anyone in her way. But this is where the rub is: why? what's made her into a killer? what life experiences have led her to this? what's it got with gender and social and class roles at the time? And a myriad other questions, all left completely untouched by the director. There's no character development whatsoever, either with the main character or the rest of them. The central visual motif of her sitting resplendent in the middle of a large couch with her voluminous skirts arranged around her at various points if the ""plot"" is an obvious trick but it's actually an empty cinematic gesture. Especially at the end of the whole thing when she's left alone after the mayhem she's caused. Big deal! There's two interpretations possible: either she's now in trouble for being left alone, or this is what she was trying to achieve by killing and driving everyone away. Again, I say, big deal! In either case the why remains a mystery. One interpretation I amused myself with has to do with Pugh's looks: a chunky girl, sturdy like a peasant. Her returned husband's comments that she's grown larger all over in his absence had me rolling on the floor. Hallelujah and Amen to that. A capable director would have made something of it. Are her peasant looks a symbol for peasantry revolting against the privileged class? Well sat so for heaven's sake. The black characters are such an interesting component, but again nothing's done with them. A frustratingly empty movie despite the visual gloss. Two stars for the black cast especially the maid Anna and the boy Toby.",Lady Macbeth

I can't say that it is boring, because the storyline though lacking some more action, it did hook me to its end. The acting is not bad but nothing special in my opinion. It is set on those times where women had no rights and belonged to their husband. It tells the story of a psychopath. Did felt it could have been better developed. I am sure the book which is based upon fills a lot of the gaps I felt while watching the film and I am sure it will be much richer. Nothing new, most books turned into movies are go much deeper. I won't read it though. The movie didn't pull me in that direction. The photography is beautiful.",Lady Macbeth

She is going to be huge soon and it is so well deserved. Nothing about her role is easy and she absolutely owns it!

53,dwankan,Intriguing Failure,5,20 May 2018,"This film tries to do some interesting things, but it fails.
It tries to be a feminist critique of old fashioned sexism, and so we have a young woman whose father has sold her to an abusive husband who controls her and is unable to show any affection for her. Where it goes from there is an absurd slippery slope. Her first subtle step toward disobeying her husband leads her headlong into sociopathic selfishness. I could almost handle that as a statement of ""look what oppression does to people,"" but other details in the film suggest the message that women are better under control. She was immediately attracted to a man whom she caught leading a group sexual assault on another woman, and she stifled her feelings until the man forced himself into her room and sexually assaulted her (I mean, what girl can resist a rapist).
The plot was tense, and I watched it partly out of intrigue and partly out of curiosity. There were a number of complications throughout, but they became progressively less believable. The writer seemed to have thought less about the logic/motivation of each new twist, and by the end, the turns in the plot had become consistently both absurd and unsurprising. I gave up trying to find a way to explain the ridiculous choices the characters made because they were largely unexplainable.
The casting was the final weirdness. A great deal of the cast were black actors. Had this been a light-hearted comedy or action flick, I would have been okay with the anachronistic lack of racism, but since it was a starkly realistic film focused on ugly human behavior, it makes no sense to pretend that that one didn't exist in that time and place. A glaring example of this is when a black woman walks into the home of a white woman in 19th century Scotland and makes demands of her, demands which the white woman seems powerless to resist. I feel weird complaining that a black character had social power in a film's story, but in the context, it feels wrong. Not only were there very few people of African descent in that time in Scotland, but they certainly would not have been able to lord themselves over white people, as that particular character did to the protagonist. I can't help wondering if the director just wanted to earn progressive points by saying at parties (to other white people of course) that he had hired some of ""those people"" for his film.",Lady Macbeth
54,fishermensmell,Tedious film-school attempt at poignancy,3,8 March 2021,"Apparently this is the first film by both the director and scriptwriter and it shows, since it ticks all the right boxes in terms of form and technique, but lacks its own character and ultimately feels like a very well-mannered exercise by drama and film school graduates. The slow, quiet pacing and relatively sparse dialogue is a technique lifted from other more successful period films, and whilst it can be effective in creating a discomforting and tense mood, in the hands of an amateur it can create boredom, and that's the pervading sense that runs through Lady Macbeth.The story is well-worn to anyone familiar with Victoriana: the wife trapped in an arranged, passionless marriage, bored and unfulfilled. So, in this case, she commences a torrid affair with an especially brutal farmhand (first meeting him acting as the apparent ringleader of a particularly unpleasant gang rape,) seemingly enjoying the thrill of her social transgression more than the man himself. Events then unfold fairly predictably as she escalates her behaviour to lying and murder in order to maintain her affair. Obviously the title sign-posts that the character will develop in a totally ruthless manner, and hence her actions do not shock, but feel utterly run-of-the-mill.I found this a very tedious and drab film. The adaptation of the original novel feels ham-fisted and inauthentic in terms of dialogue and scenarios. The highlights are the sets, costumes, beautiful photography and framing.",Lady Macbeth
55,hi_im_manic,Sociopath in a class Society,8,27 October 2017,"I agree with the majority of the finely articulated reviews previously posted. There are deviations from the novel that are inexplicable and a nuisance. Firstly, the geography, moved from Russia to Scotland yet the characters indicate a tale better suited to the American South. It's vigorous exercise to accept that certain events and behaviors took place. If they were excluded though, it would have made for a much less entertaining film! The pacing was brilliant, not too slow not fast. It's hard to judge how much time has lapsed. How long was Katherine subjected to harsh subservience following her wedding before the ""Masters"" left her? How long did she toy with Sebastian and take daily strolls before he appears at her bedroom door? How long did their torrid, carnal affair last before the Masters of the home returned? There are indications that long periods lapse between each event but one cannot be certain.The setting was subtly striking and realistic. It's not opulent nor colorful as seen in other period films. The most colorful object is a royal blue, restrictive dress Katherine wears as she sits silently, austierly... quite literally bored stiff. The furnishings and style of decor show great attention to detail and accuracy. As others have mentioned, only the breed of the cat is maligned to the time period. I didn't find it to be a bother, I was pleased a cat was there at all since they were necessary in manors. Most of the characters are nasty, unsavory people with little or no redeeming qualities. Poor long- suffering Anna, an indescript servant girl, the Grandmother Agnes, and little Teddy are the only ones with measurable humanity. They add heart where there's otherwise nothing but selfish indignity and ruthlessness.Katherine is a cunning villianess, a sociopath from the high class. She's not only driven by boredom, rebellion and lust but deep seated sadism, entitlement, and indifference for others. She has no remorse for her actions, not ever. That's the very definition of an anti-social personality. Perhaps her husband rejected her because he could read behind her facade.A more likely explanation for the husbands rejection and objectification of Katherine is that he did not want to give the father he resented the satisfaction he desired. He too, was rebellious and felt restricted. Thus, he fathered a bastard child with an ""inappropriate"" woman, and when his controlling father BOUGHT him an ""appropriate"" bride and demanded an heir, he resented it and refused to comply. His motivation seems clear enough to me. Sweet little Teddy, the aforementioned ""bastard"" child should have been embraced by his paternal family not hidden away, and he should be the rightful heir to the estate. When he comes to claim his birthright we know he stands little chance. When Katherine unexpectedly warms to Teddy, and we watch their relationship develop, we have hope. We see genuine gentleness. Hope is short-lived as Teddy's presence becomes inconvenient. He becomes another victim of Katherines scheme that she and Sebastian live as Queen and King of the manor. Katherine's plan was doomed even with the murderous elimination of human obstacles. Even moreso, because of them. I believe Sebastian would soon be fed up with her smothering ways and selfishness and he would have jetted. Sebastian was impetuous, selfish and predatory but he was not beyond feeling guilt or regret. I don't think that Katherine revealing that she was pregnant would have kept him there either. In the last moments of the film, with Sebastian, Anna, and Agnes now fine we see Katherine contemplating her predicament. She's pregnant, alone, and the birth of the child will be her undoing. One shudders to imagine how she'll eliminate the next victim.Character development is well communicated, even in silence. It was beautiful to watch how well the performers conveyed their thoughts and emotions with a simple stare or expression. The direction was near flawless in this respect. The camera- work was also noteworthy with picture-perfect framing and angles, and also with the scenic shots. The last 12 months have been cinematically impressive ones, producing works such as this. It is another that I will eagerly add to my collection.",Lady Macbeth

Develops from a slow and bleak start into quite a potboiler, though you need to be patient. Wouldn't work outside the cinema very well, owing to its sparse soundtrack, total lack of music and occasional Yorkshire dialect which may fox a few. Lots of brutish emotion which I found quite harrowing at times, even though there is little explicit violence the coarseness of feeling and unsentimentality of all the characters can be tough going. Generally good performances, esp. the long-suffering maid who witnesses all the deceit and duplicity in her mistress by which she morphs from victim to monster over the course of 90 minutes.",Lady Macbeth
59,carolethecatlover,Messes with my mind,8,12 June 2017,"Just saw this at the Sydney Film Festival. I don't think I have seen a film that so messes with my mind or my expectations since John Carpenter's 'The Thing' sometime in the 1980s. (I'm 61). The acting is sparse, the sub-text dense, the costumes, the house in which it all happens (I would have guessed it was a play, not a Russian short story) are so cold and correct and perfectly in period. The lack of music is wonderful! How often are movies ruined by loud, distracting music? This is a horror film. It is billed as a historical drama, but no way, horror all the way, and very cleverly done as you don't realize until you walk out of the cinema. I am still shuddering. A sleeper hit for sure.",Lady Macbeth

61,peter-stead-740-486963,"Nonsensical, vacuous and masturbatory",3,10 May 2017,"There is a scene where Katherine's new husband tells her to strip and face the wall while he masturbates to her form. This seems to be the perfect image to describe how the filmmakers approached this project.As ever, no blame can be apportioned to the actors. Florence Pugh does indeed have a strong presence and the others are good also. Beautiful cinematography, direction and so on.But the writer makes a series of badly thought-through and badly realised choices.It starts with the way Alexander and his father, Boris treat Katherine with such mindless cruelty, but with no indication as to why - whether from their own history, or from the culture of the area or the period. It seems like a hastily constructed plot device to give an explanation for Katherine's later actions and so it proves.It seems they do occasionally take a break from being bastards, in Alexander's case to attend to a colliery explosion. The father departs for reasons I can't remember, but it seems equally convenient and equally disconnected from anything that might resemble a believable world beyond Katherine's interior life. I say interior life - she simply sleeps during the day.Then comes one of the most baffling scenes I've seen in a long time. She stumbles across her husband's employees in the commission of what must be a gang rape of the maid, one that is clearly intended to inflict considerable additional humiliation - they are in the process of weighing her naked, as though she were a 'sow'.An instant connection sparks between her and the man who appears to be the instigator when she asks what she would weigh. He then picks her up mockingly in a fashion I find totally unbelievable, because for him to treat her like this in such a class-structured society would undoubtedly have had serious consequences for him.This is then taken further when he enters her room later and what looks like an imminent rape, becomes sex. There is then simply a lot of sex - with no character development for either of them and no indication of how their relationship transforms them.At this point, I could not believe it was only roughly half an hour into the film. It was clearly a drama, but there was no psychological complexity of any kind.The father returns first and of course continues his berating of her - still no clue given as to why he is that harsh - a character seemingly tasked with only one thing to do over and over again. She starts to fight back, subtly at first, but this suddenly turns into his murder out of the blue. There's a big gap in her transition from abused daughter-in-law to murderer, but it's glossed over.The husband then returns and reveals he knows all about her 'whoring'. Things don't end well for him as you can imagine and the lovers stage what looks like a robbery/murder out in the woods.Again, out of the blue a woman appears, with a child she claims is Katherine's husband's illegitimate offspring. The child of course is murdered - but this time in the most laughably incompetent way.None of this seems to attract much attention - remember, according to her husband news of her 'whoring' had reached him on the other side of the county - but then the death of his father, his own strange disappearance and the subsequent death of the illegitimate boy does not bring a lot more attention, not to mention legal heat, joining all three of those dots? Ridiculous.It's rounded off with Katherine's lover trying to come clean. It backfires in that he is hauled away, but Katherine is able to talk her way of trouble. Jump cut to the cart taking him in shackles with the maid.In the entire film there was a total lack of character development and simply implausible choice after implausible choice in a series of scenes that seemed not to last more than a minute, but with multiple beautiful, languid but self-indulgent shots.The film presents itself as a stylish window into the raw passion of humanity but it is actually humanity it totally lacks, focused as it is around a character who is either a born or created monster - by the end we don't care which. Don't be suckered in by the trailer. This is not Wuthering Heights 2.0.",Lady Macbeth

63,adventurer_ci,I enjoyed it,7,16 October 2017,"The film is based on an essay by Nikolai Leskov ""Ledi Makbet Mtsenskogo uezda"", written in 1864.

Great performances by a young and talented actress Florence Pugh and Cosmo Jarvis. Not sure why feminism was brought into discussion of this film, mostly by those who did not like it. Imagination gone wild I guess. Leskov himself called his story a gloomy story in strict tones of a strong and passionate feminine character. The story was to be the beginning of a cycle about the characters of Russian women. So it has nothing to do with feminism.There is a Russian version of this movie, Ledi Makbet Mtsenskogo uezda (1989) (Леди Макбет Мценского уезда (1989), Director: Roman Balayan.

...
Ok, fine. This is suppose to be a review. Well then, let's just jump right into it:This movie is one of the best out there when it comes to dealing with themes such as morality, social constructs, anarchy (rioting against the system) & ...etc. But the beauty of it lies in how it makes a fight-till-death arena for YOU and YOUR MORALITY. Do you always do what's best for you even if it means murdering children? Or do you stay mute until you literally turn mute? If both options are too extreme, WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE? - This, this very exact question is what the movie is trying to get everyone in the audience to answer for themselves.Whatever you choose though -i hope it's morality-, learn how to embrace it. Don't be like a certain Sebastian.And if both the system and your luck failed you -like Anna-, don't just submit to it until it finally -and very literally- kills you!And if you're a Katherine, DON'T BE. If endangered or not endangering other lives, put yourself first. If neither, it's up to your morality, and piece of advice: HAVE MORALS!",Lady Macbeth
66,Danielpotato,"Because the movie has good acting, that is not enough to make a good movie.",1,25 August 2017,"Good acting is just one of the things that makes a good movie (especially from the part of the actress Florence Pugh), but not enough to save it if the rest is trash. A good script is the most important, and being consistent with the movie proposal is also important.When I went to see the film, I already knew that the film would address the theme of feminism. Feminism has many layers and variants, but feminism in the most basic way was to put women on an equal footing with men in rights.But what kind of feminism does this film address? It's certainly not the right feminism. Let's face it.Katherine Lester is kept at home, closed and prevented from leaving the house, by orders of her husband and his father. When both are no longer at home, Katherine Lester meets Sebastian (the latter was harassing Katherine Lester's maid along with other men). Therefore a man with tendencies to harass and rape.Instead of expelling him from home and work, the writers of this film begin to be delirious, and Katherine begins to want to contact this man (very feminist woman here). Including asking the harassed maid, the man's name.Sebastian (at night) enters Katherine's room and has sex (forced with her). Katherine never rejects Sebastian or anything. And she continues to have sex with him (again, very feminist woman here).Later the father of the husband of Katherine Lester, discovers of the relation with the servant. Boris decides to arrest Sebastian in the stable after having the man beaten.Katherine Lester wants to take revenge, decides to kill Boris with mushrooms of the forest. The writers go full retarded mode, and after these events. The film is just scenes of violence and sex, by the way, these scenes are not good either, since they were filmed in dead angles and are quite dark to see the details (when these scenes happened), which the viewers have no total notion of what happens in the scenes. At this point, the writers and director of this movie lack balls to even do what they set out to do. A movie about violence and sex scenes.And that's only half of the movie in question. The ending is one of the stupid endings I've seen on film, no construction to the end, no paid-off or nothingBut the amount of crap in the story (which has nothing to do with feminism, but feminism in its most basic form) is such that I gave up to think or care about the story of the film or its characters, because this film does not have any story, this film is just another film to be an excuse to put more violence and sex in irrelevant and badly constructed scenes. Stupid movie. Do not waste your time or your money on this movie.",Lady Macbeth
67,sarahilayda1,"Boring for some, but extremely impactful",8,2 November 2018,"~I love it when a movie doesn't constantly include an action or an impact scene and just lets it be. This is the story of our young bride Katherine, married to an older man who's basically never home. So she's bored. There's nothing much going on in her life, therefore in the movie. It's her and her boring life til it isn't as boring anymore, so there are boring scenes I admit, but it all pays off.
.
~This movie shows a character development, massive one. It tells the story of being a victim, a culprit, being powerful, and having no power. It's about feminism and racism. It tackles so many issues at the same time, that is if you pay attention.
.
~I'm a sucker for a beautifully shot movie, this is one of them. This is the portrait of Katherine and it's beautiful, it's innocent and guilty. Directing is simple but effective, I just love this rural style. Kind of like The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Beguiled, The Lobster, Lady Bird.
.
~Soundtrack (or lack of it) also gives a very oppressive aspect to the movie, it's a stylistic choice and I'm loving it.

However there is one major flaw that I cannot forgive and this is the casting. Whenever I see hidden ideology in a movie willing to rewrite an historical period, this make me nuts.
How can you explain that in rural England, year 1865, you see a coloured maid and a field laborer that is obviously not caucasian? The most exotic human being available at the time (except for the Victorian court or similar) would have been Irish.

70,choonmixer95,Excellent story telling - beautifully acted and directed.,9,4 May 2017,I was enthralled by this movie from start to finish. The cinematography and sound were excellent. The complete absence of a music soundtrack except for two notable atmospheric crescendos added to the overall oppressiveness of the story and the location. All of the performances were excellent and the lead was outstanding IMO. The story was in many ways familiar - being evocative of Bronte and Hardy - with its portrayal of Victorian country gentry and the brutality and sense of entitlement that sometimes occurred between the classes but the way the story unfolded frequently surprised me by not following through in the way one might have expected it to. I too would recommend a cinema viewing in order to get the full effect of the landscape and the oppressive silence of the house.,Lady Macbeth

72,ameesha-green,"Sombre, unusual, and morally interesting",8,13 February 2021,"While the title of this film is misleading, not being about Lady Macbeth at all, it is still well worth a watch. With silent opening and closing credits, it is an unusual and sombre film.The story follows Catherine, a young bride who is mistreated by her husband, having been bought as a gift by his father, who is equally unpleasant to her. While her husband is away, Catherine falls for a groomsman and begins a sexual relationship with him, until her husband returns and tries to kill her beloved, upon which she murders her husband. Quite Shakespearean, you might say.There are more murders, but the film seems less about the murders per se and more about the double standards and lack of mortality displayed from any of the characters, none of whom are likeable. Catherine who stops her maid being gang-raped then blames the same maid for the murders and lets her be imprisoned. Sebastian ring-leads the imminent gang-rape and humiliation of the maid and helps Catherine cover up a murder and commit another murder yet is then disgusted by her and blames her for the majority of their joint actions. And so on.I couldn't help but wonder what message it was trying to send: Nobody wins? Everybody is out for themselves?Despite the moral vacuousness, it is an enjoyable watch and Pugh's performance is fantastic. There is a subtlety in her facial expressions that says a lot with very little. The darkness of the film makes it oddly compelling, sort of like picking off a scab.",Lady Macbeth

Although it was not clear what the story was about, I quickly understood that it was about a woman named Katherine, whose married to a rich landowner but treated poorly by him. Florence Pugh, delivers a powerful, outstading and nearly perfect performance on camera and her performance makes the movie really entertainable and hard to lose focus on, but also some helps makes some scenes in the movie full of suspense from her performance.Overall, although the movie title is misleading, I really enjoyed this movie, it has a great plot full of surprises and oustanding performance from Pugh and other actors.

Every picture frame seem well calculated and planned. Therefore I do wonder how a cat that didn't exist in that time could find it's way into this movie. It's a cornish rex (not a devon rex that someone wrote in a review). That race was created using a cat born 1950... Why not use a race that actually existed when this movie was supposed to take place? This makes me confused and I have to give it a lower rate.

80,adrin-65078,vacuum packed,3,8 May 2017,"As in Chazelle's La La Land the defining shot in William Oldroyd's Lady Macbeth is a female faciality.Oldroyd and Chazelle's through both the camera and the edit indulge long slavering shots of both Emma Stone and Florence Pugh. Both these young actresses are sat nicely preened, motionless on the set, posing for the audience with looks of self satisfied smugness as the lens laps up their faces in an act of optic devouring.Both films are about desire, and today's directors, in particular but not exclusively male ones, seem spellbound by the images of the faces of their female protagonists as they play to realise the object of their desire. In the Public relations hand-outs this is called female empowerment. Katherine and Mia are caste as representatives of a rewritten 'desire' retro-history, and both heroines achieve the 21st century feminist dream of having it all. These movies might be understood as the consequence of the pact production companies and their directors make out with the juggernaut of pseudo-feminism orthodoxy that rolls over the global arts and political landscape. We are experiencing the implementation of a fake feminist canon of political correctness in which the female presentation, as image, vies with Bolshevik strictures concerning the historic correct destiny of workers and peasants, for the mantle of being the most deadening sterile social paradigm. Lady Macbeth is adapted from Nikolai Leskov's Russian novel, Lady Macbeth of the Mtensk District. Leskov's novel seems to have been completely corrupted in its film representation. Whereas the novel's actual back ground of serf culture with its underlying violence, serve Leskov's plot well and embed the action in a specific culture, Oldroyd's film is a decontextualized vehicle. Lady Macbeth is set in a narration black hole. The 'period look' setting reminded me of the final sequence of Kubrick's 2001 in which Bowman finds himself deposited in a neo classical apartment. Lady Macbeth seems likewise beamed up. But Katherine unlike Bowman has not been scripted to die, but rather like Schwarzenegger's Terminator, been sent to right the wrongs of history and restore a feminist gloss to literature and history. (Leskov's novel ends with Katherine and her serf lover guilty of murder and sentenced to exile in Siberia). Oldroyd's land Macbeth has as its final shot Katherine smirking into the camera.There is an immobility in the sets which together with the acting style and the lines of dialogue, give to Lady Macbeth a theatrical aspect. Both Becket and Pinter as playwrights used decontextualized settings, mannered delivery of dialogue and non naturalistic dialogue to specific dramatic effect. These writers exploited lack of context and freedom from external constraints, to probe explore and evoke metaphysical and psycho-social tension in the characters. Oldroyd's script doesn't do metaphysics; it does mechanics, the mechanicality of Katherine's career of 'desire achieved'. There is nothing for the audience to see or to understand, other than the script progressing from one event to the other, from one success to another. From Katherine's romps with Sebastian to her final murder of the young heir. There is no 'out damn spot' moment, no moments of irony or self awareness. Only that one reiterated image: Katherine sat facing outwards looking towards camera like the cat that got the cream.And a cat periodically appears throughout the film, as do landscape shots, both serving the film conceit of referencing nature as a transposed states of mind. Visual clichés that at this point have long out served any purpose other than pretension. As there were no serfs in England, Leskov's underclass characters in Lady Macbeth are given over to be played by blacks. I think the idea will have been to migrate contemporary racial sensitivities back into a decontextualized 19th century thereby deepening the meanings underscoring social relations in the film. But race relations are always mediated by context, and the interposing of race simply deepens Lady Macbeth's ontological confusion. In an English setting, race and class issues imaged in lady Macbeth, only blur and confound. A more appropriate background for the film might have been in the Southern States.By the time the end credits rolled Lady Macbeth had left me without a thought. The truth content of the movie was a void. The assembly of the movie pointed only to external relations of film making as an act of ideological purity. I did wonder if they had filmed a lesbian scene between Katherine and Anna, but wisely left it on the cutting room floor. This idle thought merely underscores the banality of a film that flaunts its credentials as an empowering medium, a piece of junk thought that underlines only that Lady Macbeth is a dishonest dis-empowering medium. adrin neatrour",Lady Macbeth

No problem for the change of country: at the end of the XIXth century, life for women in Russia or country England may have had a lot in common. But why so many black characters? To show that the oppression white women suffered from was worse for non-White women? And why the young boy who arrives later , who is a nephew in the novel, becomes a mixed-blood ward, the natural son of the husband? Everything suggested before that the husband had very low or non existent sexual performances. Why this unexpected twist? It brings only confusion.

A naive, submissive, young (and attractive) woman who has just married a rich stupid of a husband. The husband is rude, sort of a pervert and he doesn't love her one bit. And Katherine has to put up, no only with an annoying husband but also with his equally obnoxious father who only regards her as tool to bring forth an heir for his son.The film then methodically transforms Katherine into an entirely different person. Perhaps the person who had always been within her the whole time but jerked up from a dormant state by the treatments to her.This movie is great for those who appreciate raw, grounded films with strong performances and cinematography.

This film promotes the incredibly damaging common trope that women like to be overpowered by violent men.I wanted to walk out of the theatre right then and there but eventually stuck it out to the end. The film descends into letting the female lead become a reprehensible monster, including through an excruciating minute-long scene where she suffocates a small child to death, which is unbearable to watch for anyone with an ounce of empathy.Rather than being a feminist tale of liberation, it taps into our violent culture, and actually portrays its woman protagonist as a 'psycho'.

It's another one of those just plain weird for weird's sake that passes for art nowadays. Has absolutely nothing to do with Shakespeare's Macbeth. Saw it in a small theater with only a dozen people in it and no one thought it was a good flick. Even the guy showing the movie apologized to the rest of us, justifying his selection based on reviews that stated it was up for awards in Britain. It was a free showing, but I'm still out an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back. I gave it two stars because the camera was in focus for all of it.",Lady Macbeth
93,jamesfriern,Psychopaths don't get cooler than this,10,23 April 2017,"Florence Pugh is magnificent in the lead role as a cool lady psychopath. And this is one of the best films I've seen this year. It's gripping from start to finish, there's just not even a little bit of fat in the production, every scene, every piece of dialogue is sparse but meaningful and the actors all carry it off with panache. The direction is flawless. i felt trapped in a Victorian drama with no escape. The camera work is wonderful, grainy and grim in the candle light of the mansion and you could feel the personality of the characters oozing into your pores from the close-ups. Its quite brilliant. Don't miss it.",Lady Macbeth
